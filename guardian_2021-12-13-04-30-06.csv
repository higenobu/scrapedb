12/13/2021,"Maybe this is the way forward for rugby as a spectator sport. Pick two teams pretty much out of a tombola, mix Lions and World Cup winners with hastily-recruited academy kids and then watch them collectively deliver a cheerfully unscripted antidote to Covid defeatism. Despite neither side being remotely at full strength this was a crazily entertaining contest by most other measures.  Given Munster had around 34 individuals unavailable following their Covid-hit trip to South Africa, and had not played for seven weeks, the outcome will also be viewed as a minor miracle in Ireland, whose teams have had a properly epic European weekend. To Connacht smashing Stade Français, Ulster conquering Clermont and Leinster thumping Bath can now be added this unexpected Wasps walloping. A currently luckless Wasps will justifiably point to the 25th dismissal of their captain Brad Shields as a major turning point but the future, on this evidence, could be bright for the visitors, who had five debutants in their starting lineup and a similarly callow bench. They still had sufficient nous to take full advantage early in the second half when the home side were reduced to 13 men and a try bonus point was the cherry on the top for the delighted travelling fans. Ian Costello, the Munster academy coach in charge of the first team for the day, described it as “extraordinary and “special” and his players could be rightly proud of the way they weathered a challenge which would have floored many others. Even scraping together 23 players in the first place proved tricky for both teams, with almost 60 players ruled out between them. Munster have never dipped this deeply into their academy well and Wasps were almost as hamstrung, missing 18 through injury before recording eight positive tests on the eve of the game. Jacob Umaga, Sebastian de Chaves, Elliot Stooke and Tom Willis were all ruled out on the eve of the game following their final round of Covid testing, leaving their director of rugby Lee Blackett fearful that he might not be able to raise a side. “We only had 25 to pick from, that’s all we’ve got left,” said Blackett. “It’s been a difficult 48 hours. This time yesterday I couldn’t see this game going ahead.” Anyone turning up in Coventry unaware of the fraught buildup would have left wondering if rugby is always this bonkers. A madcap game veered wildly in terms of its momentum, the unfamiliarity of many combinations proving a recipe for chaos even without the referee Romain Poite’s enduring love of a vigorous breakdown contest. Poite’s key decision, though, was the dismissal of Shields, whose upright tackle on a charging Dave Kilcoyne was adjudged to be worthy of red even though the Munster player was rising towards him at the last. At first glance it looked a possible yellow card but slow motion replays tend to be less forgiving and Wasps suddenly had another yet massive forward hole to fill. Both coaches also had cause to wince at the injury toll, with Wasps now anxiously awaiting injury updates on Nizaam Carr and Gabriel Oghre ahead of this weekend’s scheduled trip to Toulouse for which Shields is now likely to be suspended. Munster, in turn, will be hoping the shoulder knock Joey Carbery suffered after a thumping tackle from Robin ‘Bomber’ Hislop is not as bad as it initially looked. For the likes of Scott Buckley, officially named the star of the game, Patrick Campbell and Daniel Okeke, however, this was absolutely a day to remember. Buckley, scorer of Munster’s fourth try which secured a priceless bonus point, made a striking impact at hooker while Campbell, a law student at the University of Limerick, showed decent pace in bursting through a midfield hole for his own debut score. The experience of Andrew Conway, Keith Earls, Tadhg Berne and the skipper Peter O’Mahony was also instrumental, not least O’Mahony’s brilliant cover tackle on a flying Thomas Young which set the early visiting tone. A sidestepping Alfie Barbeary, starting his first game since March, finished off a helter-skelter passage of play to put his side ahead 7-6 after Shields’ departure but either side of half-time the visitors took a grip on the contest via tries from Earls and Campbell. Wasps, who also lost Barbeary at half-time with a hamstring twinge, were occasionally their own worst enemies, a loose midfield pass gifting a score to Conway but ultimately it was the 21-year-old Buckley, helped by a forward pass from Beirne, who popped up to complete one of the more auspicious away days even in Munster’s fabled European history.",Sport/Sport,Shields red costs Wasps with Covid-hit Munster earning Champions Cup win,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/12/wasps-munster-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report
12/13/2021,"Conor Gallagher wasn’t even born when Crystal Palace last managed to beat Everton at home in the Premier League but a scintillating performance from the England midfielder finally ended that sequence despite a late fightback from Rafael Benítez’s side.  Such is Gallagher’s influence on the club he joined from Chelsea on a season-long loan that he has now been involved in almost half of all Palace’s goals so far this season, with six goals and three assists.. His superb second strike of the afternoon in stoppage time almost lifted the roof off Selhurst Park as Patrick Vieira’s side ended a run of three successive defeats in style. How Everton must wish they had a player like him in their ranks. “What’s extraordinary is we are talking about the 90th minute and he’s been running all over. To find the energy to score that goal took a lot,” admitted Vieira. “The challenge for him is to maintain that level.” While another lacklustre performance from Benítez’s side that saw an ineffective Richarlison show his displeasure after being hauled off with more than half an hour to play almost ended with something to show for it after James Tomkins had made it 2-0 to Palace, the Everton manager insisted the Brazilian forward had been carrying a calf injury. “At half-time we could see he was limping but he said he wanted to try the second half,” he said. “We always try to do the best for the team.” With Lucas Digne again omitted, Benítez started with Ben Godfrey at left-back once again and selected midfielder André Gomes for his first league start of the season. The spirited second-half comeback against Arsenal on Monday may have eased some pressure on their manager but Benítez knew that relinquishing a record that has stood since Andy Preece scored the only goal of the game here in October 1994 would certainly not help his cause. Palace had managed only six goals in 10 previous home matches against these opponents since then, having last beaten Everton in 2014 twice in the space of five months at Goodison Park.Jordan Ayew’s 43-game wait for a Premier League goal is another unwanted statistic Vieira would definitely prefer to put behind him and that drought should have been ended in the seventh minute. Not for the last time, Jordan Pickford came to Everton’s rescue. A twisting run by Gallagher ending with a left-footed shot that dipped just over the bar was a portent of what was to come, before Pickford beat away Wilfried Zaha’s effort at the near post. Demarai Gray’s shot from distance that was easily gathered by Vicente Guaita midway through the half was at least a sign of attacking intent from the visitors. Gomes’s volley after Godfrey had made a rare foray forward could easily have broken the deadlock but instead it went straight at the Palace goalkeeper. As well as an unbelievable work ethic, Gallagher has also developed a penchant for scoring goals since moving to south London. His fifth of the campaign duly arrived before the break when Everton failed to clear and Ayew showed great coolness to allow him to sweep the ball past Pickford. Everton’s players were sent out early for the second half presumably hoping for a repeat of their comeback against Arsenal. But it was Palace who resumed control, with Gallagher going close to his second when he nodded Zaha’s cross just wide. A stunning piece of control that saw the 21-year-old instantly bring down a long pass and almost set up Zaha took the breath away, although Gallagher was unable to direct his next effort on target after another lung-bursting run. Benítez’s response was to withdraw Fabian Delph and Richarlison, who had somehow managed only 10 touches in 57 minutes of action. The Brazilian left the pitch shaking his head, with the away supporters making their displeasure clearly heard. Their misery seemed complete five minutes later when a corner from Will Hughes found Tomkins unmarked at the back post and the centre-back gleefully rammed in his first goal for two years. Yet rather than just roll over, from somewhere Everton suddenly found their fighting spirit. A Gray free-kick went just over the bar before Salomón Rondón bundled home when Abdoulaye Doucouré’s effort deflected off Ward. Another error from Ward almost gifted them an equaliser, only for a heroic block from Jeffrey Schlupp to deny Andros Townsend a goal against his former club. Despite their struggles, Everton had already picked up more points from losing positions than any other side and their opportunity to complete another comeback came when Anthony Gordon found himself in acres of space and bearing down on Guaita’s goal. But the Spaniard was equal to his shot and Palace gratefully hacked clear, with Gallagher deservedly having the final say in stoppage time when he punished Seamus Coleman for trying to take a quick free-kick by finding the top corner from 25 yards out.",Sport/Football,Conor Gallagher double fires Crystal Palace to rousing win over Everton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/12/crystal-palace-everton-premier-league-match-report
12/13/2021,"Covid-19, we should know by now, is a moving target. In autumn the rollout of boosters to older age groups was contentious. Now they’re the single biggest focus. So why do boosters help so significantly compared with first and second jabs, and are we on a conveyor belt towards needing an ever-increasing number of top-ups? Even before Omicron, it was clear boosters would be required to maintain the levels of protection against infection, although protection against severe illness appeared to be holding up well.  Vaccines prompt the body to make neutralising antibodies that intercept Covid before the virus infects our cells, but circulating antibodies can wane over time. Data from Israel, one of the first countries to vaccinate its population, showed a drop-off in protection against infection after only three months. It revealed that were people about 15 times more likely to be infected six months after their second dose compared with a few weeks after it. Even if most people remain protected against serious illness, this waning immunity presents a significant public health issue when a proportion of adults remain unvaccinated or have immune conditions that leave them vulnerable. Omicron has made the need for boosters more urgent. Mutations in the virus mean its spike protein now looks quite different from that of the original Wuhan strain that all current vaccines were designed to target. That in turn means antibodies from previous infection and vaccination will be less efficient at intercepting Omicron. Because they stick to the virus less vigorously, a higher quantity of antibodies is also required to compensate for them being less well matched. Studies show that a booster dose increases the levels of antibodies significantly above the level seen after two doses, which some hope means waning immunity will occur more slowly after a third dose, though insufficient time has passed to determine if this is the case. Early studies also suggest that the quality of antibodies is higher following a booster. The immune system continues to refine exactly which antibodies are selected and amplified based on subsequent encounters with the virus or vaccine, and studies suggest there is a broader, more potent immune response following a third dose. There is also reason for some optimism that vaccines may hold up better against severe disease than against infection. The immune system has a second line of defence in T cells, which attack cells already infected. These tend to stick around longer and they recognise parts of the virus that are more highly conserved, meaning Omicron’s mutations are less likely to throw them off the scent. So if antibodies are not good enough to stave off infection, T-cells can swoop in to bring the disease under control before it makes a person seriously unwell. Laboratory data looks encouraging, but real-world outcomes are being followed closely in South Africa, the UK and elsewhere to answer this question, which remains one of the biggest uncertainties about how this wave will play out. For now, vaccine makers are working on variant jabs that could be ready to deploy as soon as March, but tweaking current vaccines will leave the same vulnerabilities should Omicron in the future be overshadowed by another even more fast-spreading variant. The next generation of vaccines, scientists hope, will not only be a good match to circulating strains but provide far broader immune protection so that they are effective against mutations. One possibility is a vaccine specifically designed to trigger a T-cell response to the viral replication machinery as opposed to the spike protein, which scientists have suggested could result in immunity lasting years rather than months.",News/World news,What makes boosters more effective than the first two Covid jabs?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/what-makes-boosters-more-effective-than-the-first-two-covid-jabs
12/13/2021,"Last week, Emmanuel Macron became the first French president for more than 40 years to make an official visit to the town of Vichy in order to speak about its history. His purpose was to counter an insidious historical revisionism which is casting a shadow over France’s presidential election campaign. The far-right television pundit Éric Zemmour, who announced his candidacy a fortnight ago, has claimed that the Vichy regime gave protection to French Jews during the second world war, a falsehood that has been denounced and debunked by historians. The bleak truth of the round-ups and persecution that took place, said Mr Macron, must not be “manipulated” or “revised” for political motives. That this trip was felt to be necessary gives an indication of the disturbing extent to which extreme views are becoming normalised in French politics, where the centre of gravity has lurched to the right. Around 30% of French voters plan to cast their ballot next spring either for Mr Zemmour’s reactionary agenda or for Marine Le Pen. Denying Vichy’s crimes is part of a toxic nationalism which seeks to “save” French civilisation from the effects of immigration, and draws on white supremacist “replacement” theory to suggest that traditional French culture is under threat. To an alarming degree, this agenda has succeeded in setting the tone in the presidential race so far.  The extent to which that continues to be the case may depend on the candidate for the Gaullist Républicains party, Valérie Pécresse, who recently won her party’s primary. Ms Pécresse, who would be France’s first female president were she to defeat Mr Macron, hails from the moderate, centrist wing of her party and has enjoyed a notable bounce in the polls since her victory. In a second-round runoff with the president, predicted one survey of opinion, she would score a narrow win. But to reach the second round Ms Pécresse will need to defeat both Ms Le Pen and Mr Zemmour, in what promises to be a tight three-way race on the right. In an effort to attract support away from both, and prevent defections from the more conservative wing of her own party, she has promised controversial constitutional reform to limit immigration and a referendum “on internal security and against Islamism”. In her victory speech she said she felt the “anger” of voters who felt culturally threatened by migration. Ms Pécresse’s closest rival in the primary race, Éric Ciotti, who has warned of a coming “war of civilisations” and called for a French “Guantánamo” for terror suspects, has been promised a central role in her campaign. The electoral maths – and Mr Macron’s proven ability to win support from centrist former Républicains voters – means that Ms Pécresse may feel obliged to tack in this direction, in what is becoming a race to the bottom on xenophobic policies. But it is vital that France’s traditional centre-right party remains within the political mainstream, and does not succumb to what has been described as the “Zemmourisation” of French political debate. This is all the more true given the disarray on the divided, failing French left, none of whose candidates have a realistic chance of reaching the second round runoff. Last week, the Socialist candidate for the presidency, Anne Hidalgo, suggested that if it could not unify behind a single candidate, the left risks becoming extinct as a political force. This is not a healthy state of affairs for one of the world’s most important liberal democracies. For her part, Ms Pécresse will naturally seek to navigate the most viable route to the Élysée in the spring. But as France swings right, it must be hoped that she does not sell her party’s soul in the process.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on French Gaullists: keeping the far right at bay | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/12/the-guardian-view-on-french-gaullists-keeping-the-far-right-at-bay
