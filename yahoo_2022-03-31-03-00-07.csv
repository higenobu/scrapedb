3/31/2022,"The British royals' trip to The Bahamas, Belize, and Jamaica did not go according to their plan and vision, and understandably so since the British have an entire haunting history of colonizing and enslaving Caribbeans. But since Prince William and Kate Middleton have returned to England, they are apparently feeling ""overwhelmed with remorse,"" according to an Us Weekly source. ""It was certainly more challenging than expected given the protests,"" said the source. ""They obviously know the history, but being there during the protests was a real eye-opener.”
 ICYMI, Will and Kate planned to visit a sustainable cocoa farm in Belize as their first stop in the islands, but the tour was abruptly canceled. The couple was slated to take a helicopter to Indian Creek, where the farm is, but locals and the native Q'eqchi Maya people said they were never even consulted about the visit, according to the Daily Mail. “We don’t want them to land on our land, that’s the message that we want to send,” Indian Creek chairman Sebastian Shol told the outlet. ""They could land anywhere but not on our land."" Sebastian also called their visit and tour ""a slap in the face."" There are additional issues over the land itself, which were exacerbated by the royals' visit. Now according to the Us source, Will and Kate are apparently ""focusing on the future"" since ""they can’t change what has happened in the past,"" and they are spitballing ways to “strengthen their relationship” with the other Commonwealth countries. “Obviously William and Kate want the former colonies to remain part of the Commonwealth, but [they] will support whatever decision they make, including becoming independent,” said the source. As of now, the royals are planning to work ""closely with former colonies” and add “additional oversees humanitarian work” to their plates, explained the insider. The Cambridges are planning to loop the rest of the British monarchy into their plans too. The Us source said they have ""organized a meeting with the palace to discuss their intentions and will put their point across even if it means being at odds with The Firm. They want what is right for the people.” We'll see how it all shakes out.

3/31/2022,"By Dasha Afanasieva LONDON (Reuters) - Several Russian servicemen are seeking legal help to avoid being sent to fight in the war in Ukraine, two lawyers said, after 12 members of Russia's National Guard were fired for refusing to go. Lawyer Mikhail Benyash said around 200 people had been in contact to ask what they should do in a similar situation. Pavel Chikov, another Russia-based lawyer, wrote on Telegram that there were ""analogous stories from Crimea, Novgorod, Omsk, Stavropol... The workers are appealing for legal help."" Reuters could not independently confirm the rush for legal help. The National Guard did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Ukraine and Western officials have said that Russia's forces are suffering from severely low morale in what Moscow calls its special operation to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbour. The West has cast it as a poorly executed, imperial-style land grab. In five weeks, Moscow has failed to capture any major cities and on Tuesday said it would sharply reduce operations near Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv, although on Wednesday attacks on Chernihiv continued. On Feb. 25, a day into the invasion, a National Guard commander in the southern Krasnodar region and 11 men from his company refused to follow an order to cross the border to Ukraine, Chikov wrote in an earlier post. The group said the order was illegal because they didn't have their international passports and because their main job description was confined to Russia, Chikov wrote. They believed they would be breaking the law by going abroad as part of an armed group. Reuters could not independently verify the account. The servicemen were fired, the lawyers said, and went on to file a wrongful dismissal lawsuit. On Tuesday, however, only three of the 12 proceeded with their claim, according to Benyash, who is representing them. Russia created the National Guard in 2016 to fight terrorism and organised crime. Since then, it has cracked down on peaceful anti-government protests and in 2020 was placed on standby by President Vladimir Putin to intervene in Belarus, which was squashing civil unrest of its own.

3/31/2022,"A Washington Post report published Wednesday shed new light on Hunter Biden's dealings with a Chinese energy firm and confirmed several details found on the hard drive of a laptop he allegedly abandoned in a Delaware repair shop. According to The Washington Post, CEFC China Energy, which has close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and People's Liberation Army, paid entities controlled by the then-cash-strapped Hunter Biden or his uncle James Biden $4.8 million over the course of 14 months beginning in 2017. The New York Post began publishing stories based on information found on the laptop hard drive in September 2020. Due to concerns about the laptop's provenance and warnings from current and former intelligence officials that the laptop might be a Russian disinformation operation, social media sites suppressed the story until after the election. According to The New York Post, social media users' inability to share the Hunter Biden laptop story ""helped swing the election to Biden."" Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that emails recovered from the laptop had been ""authenticated."" Wednesday's Washington Post report adds further weight to that authentication. The Hunter Biden story may not have propelled former President Donald Trump to victory in 2020, but he's hoping it might help him win in 2024. In an interview broadcast Tuesday, Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin ""should release"" any dirt he has on Hunter Biden and that Putin would probably ""be willing"" to provide it, since he's currently ""not exactly a fan of our country."" Hunter Biden remains under federal investigation by a grand jury.

3/31/2022,"Shortly before father James Amabile went missing, Pennsylvania police say he was on his way to pick up his two children from their babysitter’s home. That was Dec. 4, 2003, WPVI reported. “We were able to ascertain that Mr. Amabile left his residence in the late afternoon ... after oversleeping and rushing out to pick up his 2 daughters (ages 5 and 8) from the babysitter,” Adventures With Purpose said in a statement shared to Facebook. “Mr. Amabile called the babysitter stating that he would be there within 5 minutes. “Mr. Amabile never arrived and was never seen again.” Adventures With Purpose, a team of search and recovery divers who help families find their loved ones, worked to help find the remains of Amabile. “After searching several waterways our investigation took us to Stingers waterfront where 18 years later we were able to utilize technology not available at the time of his disappearance, to uncover a submerged vehicle in Darby creek 200 yards away, 24 feet beneath the surface,” the organization said in a March 20 Facebook post. They then contacted the Ridley Township Police Department, which helped identify human remains pulled from the vehicle. Police confirmed the vehicle’s license plate matched the 2003 missing person cold case, WTXF reported, and the Delaware County Medical Examiner’s Office confirmed the remains were of Amabile. Ridley Township Police Captain James Dougherty told KYW this discovery brings closure. “The cooperation of Ridley Township PD was critical in the success of this recovery every step of the way and we tip our hat to their professionalism and their trust in our experience to conduct this forensics recovery,” Adventures With Purpose said. “At this moment we want to take a moment to express our sympathies to the entire Amabile family as they navigate this tragic outcome to a nightmare that has lasted 18 years.” Darby Creek, in Ridley Township, is in the Philadelphia metropolitan area.

3/31/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. intelligence officials have determined that Russian President Vladimir Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about his nation's forces’ poor performance in Ukraine, according to a U.S. official. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a 55 minute call on Wednesday that an additional $500 million in direct aid for Ukraine was on its way. It's the latest burst in American assistance as the Russian invasion grinds on. A U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss recently declassified intelligence, said the intel finding indicates that Putin is aware of the situation on information coming to him and there is now persistent tension between him and senior Russian military officials. The Biden administration is hopeful that divulging the finding could help prod Putin to reconsider his options in Ukraine. The war has ground to a bloody stalemate in much of the country, with heavy casualties and Russian troop morale sinking as Ukrainian forces and volunteers put up an unexpectedly stout defense. But the publicity could also risk further isolating Putin, who U.S. officials have said seems at least in part driven by a desire to win back Russian prestige lost by the fall of the Soviet Union. Asked about the latest intelligence, Secretary of State Antony Blinken did not confirm the findings, but suggested that a dynamic within the Kremlin exists where advisers are unwilling to speak to Putin with candor. “One of the Achilles’ heels of autocracies is that you don’t have people in those systems that speak truth to power or have the ability to speak truth to power, and I think that’s what we’re seeing in Russia,” Blinken told reporters during a stop in Algeria on Wednesday. The unidentified official did not detail underlying evidence for how U.S. intelligence made its determination. The intelligence community has concluded that Putin was unaware that his military had been using and losing conscripts in Ukraine. They also have determined he is not fully aware of the extent to which the Russian economy is being damaged by economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. and allies. The findings demonstrate a “clear breakdown in the flow of accurate information” to Putin, and show that Putin’s senior advisers are ""afraid to tell him the truth,” the official said. Biden notified Zelenskyy about the latest tranche of assistance during a call in which the leaders also reviewed security aid already delivered to Ukraine and the effects that weaponry has had on the war, according to the White House. Zelesnkyy has pressed the Biden administration and other Western allies to provide Ukraine with military jets, something that the U.S. and other NATO countries have thus far been unwilling to accommodate out of concern it could lead to Russia broadening the war beyond Ukraine's borders. Prior to Wednesday's announcement of $500 million in aid, the Biden administration had sent Ukraine about $2 billion in humanitarian and security assistance since the start of the war last month. That's all part of the $13.6 billion that Congress approved earlier this month for Ukraine as part of a broader spending bill. The new intelligence came after the White House on Tuesday expressed skepticism about Russia's public announcement that it would dial back operations near Kyiv in an effort to increase trust in ongoing talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials in Turkey. “We’ll see,” Biden said about that announcement. “I don’t read anything into it until I see what their actions are.” Russian forces pounded areas around Ukraine’s capital and another city overnight, regional leaders said Wednesday. White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said the administration views any movement of Russian forces as a “redeployment and not a withdrawal” and “no one should be fooled by Russia’s announcement.” Putin has long been seen outside Russia as insular and surrounded by officials who don’t always tell him the truth. U.S. officials have said publicly they believe that limited flow of information –- possibly exacerbated by Putin’s heightened isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic -– may have given the Russian president unrealistic views of how quickly he could overrun Ukraine. The Biden administration before the war launched an unprecedented effort to publicize what it believed were Putin’s invasion plans, drawing on intelligence findings. While Russia still invaded, the White House was widely credited with drawing attention to Ukraine and pushing initially reluctant allies to back tough sanctions that have hammered the Russian economy. But underscoring the limits of intelligence, the U.S. also underestimated Ukraine’s will to fight before the invasion, said Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, in recent testimony before Congress. — AP diplomatic writer Matthew Lee in Algiers, Algeria contributed reporting.",World/Associated Press,"Putin misled by advisers on Ukraine, US intel determines",https://news.yahoo.com/putin-misled-advisers-ukraine-us-145500301.html
3/31/2022,"ROME, March 30 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin outlined to Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi a system for paying for Russian gas in roubles during a phone call between the two leaders on Wednesday, Draghi's office said. Russia has said that, because of Western financial sanctions over Ukraine, it plans to require payment for its energy exports in roubles rather than the usual euros or dollars. Italy is heavily dependent on Russian gas, and Draghi had previously rejected this. The statement from his office did not say what his response was to Putin's description of how it would work. ""The conversation centered on the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine and their latest developments,"" the statement said. It was the first such telephone conversation between Draghi and Putin since Russia's invasion of its neighbour on Feb. 24. Draghi ""underlined the importance of establishing a ceasefire as soon as possible,"" his office said, adding that the two leaders agreed it was a good idea to remain in contact.
