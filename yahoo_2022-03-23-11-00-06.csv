Viktoriia Roshchyna recorded a video saying the Russians ""saved her life"" after she was released. Her publisher says the video was a condition of her release. A Ukrainian journalist who was captured by Russians was released from captivity Monday after she recorded a video saying the Russians had ""saved her life."" Local Ukrainian publication Hromadske said on Tuesday that Viktoriia Roshchyna — a journalist for the media outlet who had been taken into Russian custody on March 15 — had been freed and was now on her way to Zaporizhzhia to meet her family. Hromadske reported that several hours prior to her release, pro-Russian outlets and Telegram channels began to show a video of Roshchyna saying that Russians were never holding her captive, but instead, they had saved her life. Hromadske reported that said video was a condition of Roshchyna's release from detainment. The outlet said she plans to tell the truth about captivity in the ""near future."" Hromadske said last week that it learned on on March 16 that Roshchyna was taken into Russian custody. Witnesses told the outlet on that Roshchyna was ""probably"" detained by Russia's Federal Security Service. Roshchyna was reporting on the Russia-Ukraine war at the time of her capture. She wrote about issues in the Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions, Hromadske reported. Translations by Oleksandr Vynogradov.

3/23/2022,"Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings have devolved into a festival of racist dog whistles, so much so that Republican senators who aren’t even on the Judiciary Committee are trying to get in on the action. Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) went so far as to tell reporters on Tuesday that he doesn’t believe interracial marriage should be legal nationwide, before later walking back his comments, claiming he didn’t understand the question. The question, however, was pretty explicit.

Wade was an example of such activism. Braun argued that such issues should be left up to the states and that striking down Roe would bring “it back to a neutral point, to where that issue should never have been federalized.” This prompted the question about whether he felt the same way about interracial marriage, which the court legalized in 1967, to which Braun, again, said yes. He tried to walk back the comments. “There is no question the Constitution prohibits discrimination of any kind based on race, that is not something that is even up for debate, and I condemn racism in any form,” he said, according to NBC News. Jackson is the first Black woman to be nominated to sit on the Supreme Court. She introduced her husband, who attended the hearing with one of their daughters, in an emotional moment on Monday. “I have no doubt that without him by my side from the very beginning of this incredible professional journey, none of this would have been possible,” she said. “We met in college more than three decades ago, and since then he’s been the best husband, father, and friend I could have ever imagined. Patrick, I love you.” Braun’s comments on Tuesday indicate he believes that states should have the right to prohibit Jackson and her husband, who is white, from being married.

3/23/2022,"A US official said some Russians were getting frostbite in Ukraine because they had the wrong gear. The official said the issue had forced those troops to the sidelines of the fighting. It's the latest setback Russian forces have faced in their invasion. Russian forces are getting frostbite while fighting in Ukraine because they don't have adequate cold-weather gear, a senior US defense official said. The official told reporters during a Tuesday Pentagon briefing that the frostbite problem had forced some Russian troops to the sidelines during the war. ""They're struggling on many fronts,"" the official said, according to the Task & Purpose reporter Haley Britzky. It's the latest setback Russian forces have faced in their invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24. A US defense official told reporters at a Monday background briefing that Russian forces were experiencing issues with morale within their ranks because they did not expect such a fierce resistance from Ukraine. Many Russian troops also had no idea which orders they'd be forced to take in Ukraine, the official said. Russian forces were also having communication and logistical problems in Ukraine, the official said. Russia's advance on Ukraine has appeared to largely stall across multiple fronts as it struggles to achieve significant military objectives. As a result, Russian forces are ramping up their assault on Ukrainian cities and civilians, leaving scores dead and displacing millions.
