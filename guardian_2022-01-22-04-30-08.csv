1/22/2022,"A special justice department unit created to combat threats against election officials made its first arrest on Friday after a man allegedly posted threats online against Georgia election workers. Chad Stark, a 54-year-old resident of Texas, was arrested by law enforcement after officials alleged he posted a message on Craigslist on 5 January 2021 saying that he wanted “Georgia Patriots” to kill several election officials.  “Georgia Patriots it’s time for us to take back our state from these Lawless treasonous traitors. It’s time to invoke our Second Amendment right it’s time to put a bullet in the treasonous Chinese [Official A]. Then we work our way down to [Official B] the local and federal corrupt judges,” read the message. “It’s our duty as American Patriots to put an end to the lives of these traitors and take back our country by force we can no longer wait on the corrupt law enforcement in the corrupt courts.” Stark was charged with one count of communicating interstate threats, which has a maximum sentence of five years in prison. He is expected to make his first appearance in an Austin, Texas, court on Friday afternoon. Stark’s arrest marks the first criminal case brought by the interagency election threats taskforce. The unit was created in June 2021 under the Biden administration to help address a rise in threats to election workers following the 2020 presidential election. “The justice department has a responsibility not only to protect the right to vote, but also to protect those who administer our voting systems from violence and illegal threats of violence,” said the attorney general, Merrick Garland.",News/US news,US taskforce defending election officials makes first arrest over alleged death threats,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/21/us-election-threats-task-force-arrest-texas-georgia
1/22/2022,"The inquiry was launched last year after allegations emerged about a series of parties in Downing Street in the winter lockdown of 2020, including a Christmas party and a leaving do, as well as a drinks event at the Department for Education. Initially, it only covered these three events and was due to be conducted by cabinet secretary Simon Case.  Boris Johnson ordered Case to investigate because he was coming under political and public pressure over the parties. No 10 believed commissioning an investigation would help to draw a line under the affairs. However, with more revelations about gatherings and the prime minister’s own involvement, the scope of the inquiry has kept swelling and implications become more serious for Johnson. When it emerged that the private office of Simon Case may have had their own gathering, Johnson handed over responsibility to another senior civil servant. Sue Gray, currently second permanent secretary in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, was formerly head of propriety and ethics in the Cabinet Office and is known for carrying out such work. She has a fearsome reputation, with some praising her fairness and others claiming she works in an untransparent manner. The terms of reference still only mention three parties but the remit has now widened to cover up to 16 alleged gatherings, including two in the garden of No 10 in May 2020 where the prime minister was in attendance for a short time, and two held by No 10 staff on the eve of the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral in April 2021. Gray’s findings will next week be handed to the prime minister, who commissioned the inquiry. They are likely to be statements of fact, and will not include accompanying evidence such as transcripts or correspondence. Johnson will be given advance sight of the summary and then he will be expected to make it public and give a statement to the House of Commons. Government sources say Gray’s findings will be factual, but it is possible they could edge into finding a factual breach of guidelines or even the law. However, the terms of reference say any suspected criminal wrongdoing would be handed to the police and the inquiry would be paused – which so far has not happened. As for any disciplinary action as a result of the findings, that is a matter for the Cabinet Office if it relates to No 10 staff, or the prime minister if it relates to ministers – including himself. Johnson could end up referring the findings to Lord Geidt, the independent adviser or ministerial interests, if his own conduct in relation to the ministerial code is questioned by Gray. Johnson’s political future is riding on the Gray report. If he comes out of it badly, MPs could well launch a leadership challenge against him by submitting letters of no confidence in him to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers. If it finds Johnson behaved unwisely or foolishly, without saying or implying that he broke the rules or ministerial code in terms of his openness and honesty, then it is possible that he may avoid an attempt to topple him. Numerous Tory MPs have made clear they are awaiting the outcome of the report before they decide whether to continue backing Johnson as prime minister or not. Either way, there is a huge amount riding on what Gray says.",News/Politics,No 10 parties inquiry: when will Sue Gray report and what happens next?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/21/no-10-parties-inquiry-when-will-sue-gray-report-and-what-happens-next
1/22/2022,"Manchester City are close to signing the Argentina forward Julián Álvarez from River Plate, although the 21-year-old would not move to England until June at the earliest. Negotiations are continuing, with City offering €16m (£13.4m) plus add-ons and River wanting a guarantee of at least €21m, but there is optimism at the Premier League club that an agreement will be struck.  River would like to keep Álvarez, who came through their youth teams, until June or even November, when the World Cup starts in Qatar. The likeliest outcome is that he would stay until June, although City could also choose to loan him elsewhere. Personal terms will not be an issue and City are ready to provide a five-year contract for a player who got his club debut in October 2018 and won the first of his five caps in June 2021.

1/22/2022,"Boris Johnson is facing calls to ensure all evidence on the Downing Street parties is published with the Sue Gray inquiry, as it emerged the pivotal report is likely to amount to a concise summary of findings. Labour and the Liberal Democrats called on Friday for the report to be published along with its accompanying evidence – including emails and witness accounts – to give full transparency around more than 15 alleged parties under investigation by Gray, a senior civil servant.  The publication is expected to have huge political ramifications as many Conservative MPs have said they will await its findings before deciding whether to back Johnson to stay on as prime minister. If they are unsatisfied, he could face a no-confidence ballot. Government sources said the report was likely to be ready at some point in the middle to end of next week, and Gray would hand it to No 10. It is understood Johnson will get advance sight of the report but then be expected to make it available to the public and parliament within hours. The terms of reference of the investigation make it clear that “findings” will be made public. However, the Guardian understands that does not include accompanying evidence such as emails, text messages or transcripts of interviews, or precise details about what happened at any of the alleged gatherings. Government sources pointed to the outcomes of the investigations into Priti Patel, the home secretary, and Damian Green, the former deputy prime minister, as examples of how such findings tend to be set out. Both ran to less than two pages. The investigation file, including the evidence on which the findings rely, is unlikely ever to be published, the sources said. This may mean an email allegedly sent by a senior official warning Johnson’s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, not to have drinks in the No 10 garden on 20 May 2020 may never be made public. The email is crucial, as Johnson insists he was not warned that the “bring your own booze” event might be against the rules, and that he was unaware it was a party when he spent about 25 minutes there speaking to staff, believed to number 30 to 40. The findings will instead be statements of fact about what happened, while leaving the matter of any disciplinary action to the civil service and the prime minister. Johnson could decide to refer himself and any other ministers to the independent adviser on ministerial interests, Lord Geidt. Redactions from the findings of the names of junior staff and the potential for any disciplinary action against them are also possible. Angela Rayner, the deputy leader of the Labour party, called for a greater degree of transparency around the parties, which have provoked outrage across the country, from members of the public to Tory MPs. “Boris Johnson cannot be allowed to cover up or obscure any of the truth when he has insisted on a hugely protracted internal probe to tell him which parties he attended and what happened in his own home. The Sue Gray report must be published in its entirety with all accompanying evidence,” she said. Rayner said transparency in government has been eroded under the prime minister. “The Conservatives have shown us how little respect they have for the rules, we’ve seen private WhatsApps, missing phones, a freedom of information clearing house, lost minutes of lobbying meetings – their cover-up culture has lost the trust of the British public.” Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, also joined calls for more transparency around the report. He said: “Trust is at an all-time low, so this report must be open to scrutiny from all those who’ve lost loved ones and all those who stuck to the rules. Aside from personnel and employment issues, Boris Johnson owes it to parliament, and above all to the people, to publish this report and the transcripts in full. Anything else will be seen as the usual lies and bending of the rules.” Despite the decision not to publish accompanying evidence, several current and former civil servants who know Gray said they believed the report would still be an accurate and potentially damning account of the parties that would not shy away from difficult conclusions. They pointed to the Green investigation, which she led as head of the propriety and ethics team, and resulted in his resignation in 2017. However, other former civil servants highlighted her ability to navigate her way through tricky political problems, which has led to the nickname “Sue Gray Area”. Gray’s investigation has consistently been described as “independent” despite her being a senior civil servant reporting to the prime minister. Asked whether the probe was independent, Johnson’s deputy official spokesman said on Friday: “Yes, it is. It is for that inquiry, that team, to establish the facts, we’ve said before … it’s an independent investigation team, I think we’ve set that out from the start.” The spokesman was asked what about the inquiry made it independent, and he said: “Well, as we’ve set out, it’s being run independently by a civil servant who’s been asked to establish the facts.” On Friday night new details emerged about the two parties allegedly held in No 10 on 16 April last year for the departure of James Slack, then Johnson’s director of communications, and a Downing Street photographer. Slack has since apologised “unreservedly”. About 30 people attended both gatherings, with the photographer’s taking place in the basement of No 10 while Slack’s colleagues met in the press area. Both groups later met up in the garden, the Daily Telegraph reported. The newspaper was also shown a photograph of revellers in the basement, although it is unknown if this or any related texts have been seen by Gray. The basement party reportedly went on for at least seven hours until 1am, according to text messages seen by the Telegraph. Wine was spilt on a government printer as music bellowed from a laptop. A takeaway pizza was ordered into No 10, it is alleged, with slices handed around the garden – while other partygoers took turns on a slide bought for the Johnsons’ infant son, Wilfred.",News/Politics,PM facing calls to ensure all evidence is published in No 10 parties inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/21/pm-facing-calls-to-ensure-all-evidence-is-published-in-no-10-parties-inquiry
1/22/2022,"My wife, Joy Smith, who has died aged 90, helped shape the lives of not only our five children, but also many in infant and junior schools in London, Suffolk and Hampshire. When not in the classroom, she was involved in many voluntary activities. Born in Muswell Hill, north London, Joy was the daughter of Elsie (nee Taylor) and Maurice Garner, a chartered accountant who taught her double-entry bookkeeping for her pocket money. Wartime evacuation took the family to Shropshire, and on their return in 1946 Joy went to Hornsey high school for girls, where she became head girl.  At Manchester University (1949-53) she graduated in mathematics and physics, and qualified as a teacher, her first post being in Hackney, east London, for three years. She and I had met through the Christian Union at Manchester, and after marrying in 1956 we moved to Ipswich, in Suffolk, where our first four children were born. Joy then taught briefly in two infant schools in the town. In 1970 the family relocated to Dibden Purlieu, Hampshire, where again Joy taught briefly before having our fifth child. She did voluntary work with disabled children, refurbished sewing machines for developing countries and taught in Sunday school. Her final decade of teaching (1978-88) was undertaken in schools between Southampton Water and the New Forest. Seeing spinners at work at the folk museum at Cregneash on the Isle of Man in 1981 encouraged Joy to spin and dye her own wool. She designed and knitted garments for family, friends, Oxfam and the Baby Bundles charity. On retirement in 1991 we moved to Norfolk to volunteer at the Pickenham Centre, a Christian educational establishment near Swaffham. Joy served as a governor of the village school, helping out in various capacities, and was an active member of the Mid-Norfolk Guild of Weavers, Spinners and Dyers and the WRVS, delivering meals on wheels. In 2001 we returned to urban life in Derby, and Joy made new friends through Scottish country dancing. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2010 and her Oxfam blanket squares began to assume strange geometric shapes; in 2019 she went into a care home. Her warm smile was one of the last things to leave her. Our son Mark died in 2019. She is survived by me, our children Hilary, Chris, Jenny and Jackie, 11 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.",News/Education,Joy Smith obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2022/jan/21/joy-smith-obituary
1/22/2022,"Tens of thousands of Australians will have grappled with long Covid by the end of the year and a plan is urgently needed to treat and monitor them, according to an associate professor with Deakin University who has modelled long Covid prevalence. Prof Martin Hensher, a health economist with expertise in health system organisation, says: “I think we can be very confident that we will see many tens of thousands of people who will have long Covid, and possibly over 10,000 people who will still have long Covid by the end of the year.”  While most people with Covid-19 recover within four weeks, about 5% still experience symptoms three months later, often described as long Covid. Long Covid is described by the World Health Organization as symptoms that last for at least two months after infection, and which cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. “Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction but also others which generally have an impact on everyday functioning,” the definition states. “Symptoms may be new onset, following initial recovery from an acute Covid-19 episode, or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate or relapse over time.” Hensher and his colleagues previously estimated long Covid prevalence by examining the 2021 Delta outbreaks in Victoria and New South Wales in which nearly 140,000 people had been infected by the end of October. They are now updating that modelling to include the much higher number of cases due to the spread of Omicron. “While we have not finished that yet, we can say fairly confidently with the sheer numbers of cases that we’ve had in this outbreak, and the fact that the true number of cases is clearly going to be significantly more than that, we will have seen well over 2m Covid cases as a very conservative estimate by the end of this outbreak,” he says. “This will correspond to more than 10,000 people with long Covid after one year.” Hensher says Australia urgently needed to roll out a regular national survey to ask people about their experience with Covid, including their ongoing symptoms. “We are flying blind about the actual scale of long Covid in this country. “All we have is models like ours, but we need more primary data to help inform our models. I hope we see fewer long Covid cases than I am suggesting, but the way our health system operates means it is very hit and miss as to whether we are properly capturing and measuring those with long Covid.” Hensher says the federal government should fund a national post-Covid centre of excellence bringing together expertise not just for long Covid, but other longer-term health impacts, such as damage the disease causes to the heart and lungs. “That centre should revise treatment guidelines according to best practice,” Hensher says. “In addition each state and territory needs to set up a care coordination centre bringing together resources of public and private health systems including physiotherapists, pain experts and others who can give people with ongoing effects the treatments they need, because their GP may not have the expertise and time.” The director of Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Prof Tom Marwick, is a cardiologist leading a study examining the persistent cardiovascular effects of Covid-19, called the PERCEIVE study. Marwick says at the start of the pandemic there were concerning reports about the impact of Covid on the heart. He and his colleagues examined the frequency of cardiac complications from Covid in Australia, whether certain medications could protect the heart muscle and whether exercise could help people regain fitness after infection. “Our study has been affected by lockdowns, when it was difficult to get patients to come in for investigations,” Marwick says. “But we did manage to examine the first 100 or so patients, and interestingly, the number of people who had objectively reduced functional heart capacity was very low – less than 5%.” Marwick suspects Covid did not cause the handful of heart-related abnormalities that were detected in people weeks after an infection, but simply brought them to attention. “People who have chronic disease from high blood pressure, diabetes and [being] overweight are prone to having cardiac disturbances, but these disturbances can go unrecognised for quite a long time until somebody becomes symptomatic,” Marwick says. “Covid enables the tip of the iceberg to be seen.” Marwick says it is clear there are many drivers of lasting Covid symptoms and agrees that a range of experts needs to study how the immune system and different organs are involved. “We also need to reduce the stigma of having Covid in order to conduct these studies,” he says. “We have a facility in western Melbourne, which is an area with a lot of cardiovascular diseases and a lot of Covid. We went to community groups, we went to mosques, and tried to engage people for our study but it was more difficult than I expected, and many people mentioned stigma and privacy as concerns. They didn’t want their neighbours to find out they had Covid and judge them.” Dr Chansavath Phetsouphanh is a senior research associate at the Kirby Institute and the co-lead author on a recently published study of unvaccinated people with long Covid. The study found even those whose initial Covid infections were mild or moderate had a sustained inflammatory response at least eight months later. It indicates that even if Omicron proves to be milder, it does not necessarily follow that it will produce fewer cases of long Covid. While it is hoped vaccination will offer some protection against lasting symptoms, vaccinated people with mild disease experience long Covid too, Phetsouphanh says. “A few studies from the UK suggest vaccinations halve the chance of long Covid but with the prevalence of Covid with the current wave, long Covid is a concern,” he says. “Our study found a majority of long Covid patients had mild Covid, yet some were still experiencing symptoms 18 months after infection.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He says he is concerned that with such high cases numbers, those with Covid are not being followed as closely, and GPs may not be aware of many infections, or of symptoms in those who are infected. “We really need to be clinically recording these cases,” he says.",News/Society,"‘Flying blind’: Australia faces 10,000 long Covid cases by the end of the year",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/22/flying-blind-australia-faces-10000-long-covid-cases-by-the-end-of-the-year
1/22/2022,"It has been a hard few years to have family in Western Australia. On Thursday, at a late-night press conference after national cabinet, the premier, Mark McGowan, announced that his safe transition plan, which would have allowed quarantine-free travel into the state from 5 February, had been put on indefinite pause. I exchanged muted text messages with my sister, who lives in Perth, from my home in central Victoria. We were not really surprised – relying on McGowan to open the border on schedule is a mug’s game this far into the pandemic.  My phone lit up with messages from friends who also have family in WA, but no one really had the energy to be angry any more. We’re just resigned. There’s no point booking flights in anticipation of seeing loved ones at this stage and you’re better off not agreeing to attend that wedding. We’ll see you when we see you. The new border arrangements do include exceptions for returning West Australians and travel on compassionate grounds such as to attend a funeral or see a terminally-ill relative, but they still require you to be double vaccinated – triple if eligible – and to undergo 14 days quarantine. That’s something, but it’s not really workable for most people. And it presumes that those compassionate visits can wait, when often they can’t. I am luckier than most. I got to spend Christmas in Perth with my sister and her family in 2020, taking advantage of the brief window between the border coming down and the Black Rock cluster. So really, what am I complaining about? Before you head angrily to the comment section, hear this: I am not complaining at all. I know exactly why the Western Australian government has taken the decision that it has, and I understand why many of those in WA are relieved. I am just sad and frustrated that we are still in this position, awaiting a border announcement, after two years. I’m sad that my sister and I are still exchanging resigned texts after late-night press conferences from McGowan. I’m sad that my nephew and I only speak via video calls, and that I barely know my niece. Recently someone told me that their friend, whose grandchild lives in Perth, calls her “flat granny” as distinct from their regular granny, who they see in three dimensions. We’re all just sick of being flat granny. There is a conflict, in pretty much everyone I know in WA, between wanting to see family and friends in other states and overseas, and wanting to remain safely behind the barricade which has kept the pandemic at bay. Most of us who live in the eastern states also feel that conflict. My niece is too little to be vaccinated: I want her safe. I won’t risk her health for a cuddle. But I wish we weren’t still having to do this. As of Friday, 92.8% of Australians over 16 have had two doses of a Covid vaccine, and 28.9% of those eligible have had a booster. In kids, 75.38% of those aged 12-15 have had two shots and 21.6% of those aged 5-12 have had one dose. We have all endured long lockdowns, followed harsh restrictions, worn masks. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, in mid-2020, called the coronavirus a “wicked enemy”, and it’s only become more capricious since then. Omicron has spread so quickly despite very high vaccination rates. Even with much lower rates of serious disease and death than previous variants, the sheer number of cases – there are more than half a million active cases in Australia right now – has put a significant number of people in hospital. Friday was the deadliest day of the pandemic so far, with 46 people with Covid dying in New South Wales alone.

Most of us now know someone, or many people, who have had Covid and recovered. Many of us have had Covid ourselves. It’s much easier to focus on the message that you’ll probably get over it if you are surrounded by those first-hand experiences than it is if you only hear about Covid on the news. And the news is bad. Even if you’re not worried about Covid itself, you should be worried about the impact it is having on hospitals, on the capacity of ambulances and emergency wards, on supply chains. It sucks over here – of course you don’t want to be like us. So I am not complaining about the borders.

1/22/2022,"Government MP George Christensen has amped up his conspiracy theory and anti-vaccination commentary, described by the PM as “dangerous”, while signs suggest he may be quietly planning to launch his own media brand when he retires from parliament. Christensen’s commentary has become increasingly controversial in recent months since he announced he would not re-contest the north Queensland seat of Dawson at the upcoming federal election.  His public commentary has included pushing anti-vaccination messages, climate change denial and apparent conspiracy theories, and comments that have undermined his own government’s public health messaging. In the process he has built a significant Facebook following of more than 111,000 people. Guardian Australia has obtained records showing Christensen has registered a business name with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. A website domain for the MP’s company was also registered by Christensen in December. The site features the Eureka flag, which has previously been adopted by the far-right, and language calling on people to “fight for our sovereignty” and says it is “coming soon”. Speaking at online event Prayer and Pushback on Friday, Christensen appeared to confirm a move into the media landscape. “I’m not leaving politics – I’m leaving parliament – we’re all involved in politics as citizens. I’m going to be in the fray. I was a journalist before I was in politics … I’ll probably step back into that in the future, in some way, shape or form,” he said. While Christensen remains a notional member of the government, his recent commentary has opposed government policy on pandemic controls, vaccination and climate change measures. His Facebook page has repeatedly featured posts about “the great reset” conspiracy theory, claiming “an unelected global elite” was operating outside the law. At the same time, Christensen has sought to build a media profile in the United States, appearing on far-right conspiracy outlet InfoWars, where he encouraged people to protest outside Australian embassies over Covid policies and laughed as Jones compared Australia’s Covid-19 quarantine facilities with Auschwitz because they both had “big fences”. The most recent controversy – comments by Christensen suggesting children should not be vaccinated against Covid-19 – is contrary to the government’s formal medical advice. Those comments were rebuked by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, who said on Wednesday that Christensen’s views were “dangerous” and that people should “simply ignore him”. Morrison has deflected questions suggesting Christensen – who sits in the Nationals party room – should be disciplined or kicked out of the governing Coalition. Morrison said on Wednesday that he was discussing Christensen’s position on the parliament’s joint committee for investment and trade with the deputy prime minister and Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce. Later that day Christensen announced he would resign from the committee when he returns to parliament in February. Morrison said: “He is not a candidate for the government at the next election, and George has been putting out these views for some time.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Those who said people shouldn’t take the AstraZeneca vaccine, I don’t think people should listen to those views either.

1/22/2022,"On a wall at the National Gallery of Victoria hangs a spirited, aquamarine stringybark painting titled Order, a radical piece of Indigenous art that shows former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard delivering her infamous misogyny speech to parliament. Those milling about the gallery on Friday morning were in for a surprise: seeing Gillard standing underneath her portrait, visiting a painting she’d heard so much about, for the first time. “I am so big,” she says, clearly delighted.  Order was painted by Dhambit Munuŋgurr: a prolific Yolŋu artist who works in the north-east Arnhem Land community of Yirrkala. In the painting, Australia’s politicians are hangdog figures in the shadow of Gillard, who is gigantic and fierce, and surrounded by Yolŋu dancers leaping in as her bodyguards. Munuŋgurr is a longtime fan of Gillard’s because, as she told the Guardian in a profile last month, “she is a woman, like me”. In 2013, the artist prepared a painting in Gillard’s honour ahead of a scheduled visit to Yirrkala, hoping to present it to her – but just two weeks before the trip, Gillard was toppled in the Labor leadership spill, and Kevin Rudd went to Yirrkala instead. (He left without a painting.) Gillard first became aware of Order after reading a Guardian Australia profile of Munuŋgurr last month. “A friend sent me the link saying, ‘Have you seen this?’ They were just the first of many people to send it to me,” she says. “I didn’t know about it, or the story of her waiting for me. It is just fantastic … I had to come and see it. “What she’s captured – me giant-sized, these limp people, the Yolŋu coming to protect me – it is beautifully conceived and executed. The sheer presence of it – a photograph doesn’t capture the size and power of it, you need to see it in real life.” Julia Gillard’s misogyny speech, or the speech that stopped the nation, was a full 10 years ago this year – or only 10 years ago, depending on the Australian. In that time, the former prime minister’s blistering assault on then opposition leader Tony Abbott has become a TikTok meme, a choir song and the most unforgettable moment in Australian television history. “There have been many, many takes on the misogyny speech but this is a truly special one,” Gillard says. After the viewing, the NGV calls Munuŋgurr on FaceTime, so the artist can finally meet her hero and Gillard can thank her herself. While the conversation is curtailed by internet connection and language differences, the affection is not: Gillard: “It’s so lovely to see you and have the opportunity to thank you for this incredible work.” Munuŋgurr: “Ah, Order!” Gillard: “I’m sorry I haven’t been able to come see you in person, that would be a dream come true – one day.” Munuŋgurr: “I love you!” Gillard feels “astonished” by the ways Australians continue to respond to the speech. “When it all started, there were choirs singing it, people dancing to it, it was going around the world on social media,” she says. “But that it is still being shared in new and ever more creative forms all these years later – it is somewhere between heart-warming and crazy. I would have never expected it.” As to why it still resonates, she believes it has less to do with her and something bigger. Over those 10 short – or long – years, some Australians have come to feel increasingly uncomfortable about the treatment of their first female PM; or the younger Australians coming of age, who expect something more for women who enter the public sphere. “I think it’s about people, particularly women, increasingly identifying with the need to call out sexism and misogyny. It can be women who are preparing themselves to do that, because they need a bit of energy, a fight song, an anthem, before they do it – I think it can play that role for them. I think it also plays a role for women who wish they had said something but missed the moment for whatever reason – it can help overcome the frustrations of that. It has to do with the way women, and people who want to see change, are mobilising – and there is a lot of mobilisation right now.” As to whether she will meet with Munuŋgurr in Yirrkala to finally collect that painting made for her so many years ago? “I will if I can. We need to protect Indigenous communities, I have a real reticence to go trumping through until it is absolutely safe.

1/22/2022,"Unions are bracing for a flood of employers to follow the lead set by airline Qantas and stevedore Patrick Terminals by trying to rip up enterprise agreements with staff before the federal election. Labor, which has been performing strongly in recent polling, has promised to stop employers from unilaterally terminating agreements if it wins the election which is due to be held on or before 21 May.  Enterprise agreements, struck between employers and their staff, provide conditions that leave workers better off overall than the underlying award conditions governing their industry. The employment conditions they set down continue in force until a new agreement is struck or they are terminated by the Fair Work Commission. Applications to terminate enterprise agreements were relatively rare until a landmark decision in 2015 in which rail company Aurizon convinced the FWC to tear up a dozen agreements it had previously struck with unions. Following Aurizon’s victory, terminations skyrocketed, according to FWC reports and research by the Australia Institute. Terminations reached a peak of 508 in 2017-18 and have since fallen back but remain above pre-Aurizon levels of around 200 a year or less, with 330 applications to terminate lodged with the FWC in the 2020-21 year. “It looks to us like companies are seeing this moment as their best chance to cut workers’ wages and conditions, while Scott Morrison is in power,” the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Michele O’Neil, said. She said the ability of employers to obtain orders from the FWC terminating agreements without the consent of employees was a “serious flaw in workers’ protections”. “Companies are opportunistically rushing to try and cut these agreements before there’s potentially any change in government,” she said. On Thursday, Qantas said it had applied to the FWC to terminate the agreement covering flight attendants who work on its international flights “as a last resort to change restrictive and outdated rostering processes”. The application, the first ever made by Qantas despite a history of aggressive industrial relations behaviour that includes grounding its entire fleet in 2011, came after 97% of affected staff voted against a new deal proposed by the company. Qantas seeks to collapse its existing two classes of flight attendants into one class. Currently, employees hired before 2008 are on an agreement that offers higher wages and better conditions, including longer rest times between longer flights. Employees who were hired before 2008 are trained to work on Airbus A330s and Boeing 747s – the last of which Qantas retired from its fleet in 2020 – while the newer staff can work on the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 787. The airline said it wanted to “simplify complex and historical rostering conditions that meant around 20% of more than 2,500 long haul crew could only be used on a single type of aircraft – which is unworkable as the airline seeks to recover from Covid”. It said a counter-offer from the staff union, the Flight Attendants Association of Australia, “represented a $60m cost increase over four years – which is also unworkable” and accused the union of running a scare campaign against the new deal. Former Qantas employee and federal secretary of the FAAA, Teri O’Toole, said neither claim was true. She said the union had offered to compromise, agreeing to create a single class of flight attendant that was a “hybrid” of the two existing categories. Attendants employed before 2008 currently get up to five days of extra sick leave a year if they contract an upper respiratory tract infection – something the FAAA wanted extended to all staff due to the Covid pandemic. “If they’re saying it would have cost $60m, I’d be shocked, because it wouldn’t,” she said. “This was never a negotiation where they were serious about negotiating.” She said that, unlike rival Virgin, Qantas was “not on its knees” financially and during the pandemic “the cost of crew has all been paid by the taxpayer”. “They’re not trolley dollies, they’re first responders,” she said. “They will arrest unruly staff, they will fight fires, they will give you CPR and they will defend the flight deck with their life.” Patrick Terminals moved to terminate its agreement with the Maritime Union of Australia in October. Like Qantas, it has a long history of fighting the unions. Stoushes include one of the key confrontations in Australian industrial relations history, the 1988 waterfront dispute, in which the company sacked its workforce, locked them out and trained a replacement workforce of ex-soldiers in Dubai. Patrick said the agreement was “no longer fit for purpose, as it contains a number of operational restrictions that have limited the ability of Patrick to meet customer requirements at a time of congestion in global supply chains”. Clauses the company objects to include “safe manning” ones that specify minimum headcounts at work, restrictions on who it can recruit and the “provision of Foxtel, protective clothing, gym allowances, prescription glasses, tea/coffee and Milo, quiet rooms & WiFi, notice boards, microwaves, fridges, chairs, grills, lounges and recliner seats”, which it says should be dealt with through company policy rather than the agreement. Unions say terminating the agreement could cut the pay of some wharfies by up to 50%. The MUA’s national secretary, Paddy Crumlin, said killing the agreement would end “penalty rates, shift allowances and overtime provisions” that allow Patrick’s operations to run around the clock and accused the company of “sustained lies and vilification of their own workforce in the lead up to Christmas”. Patrick’s chief executive, Michael Jovicic, said the application was “not about reducing the pay of our workers”. “Patrick Terminals needs an agreement that is fit for purpose and does not hinder our ability to service our customer requirements,” he said. “At present our operations are restricted by the MUA in terms of who we recruit, how we roster, who we promote and how we service our customers. “This is not about their members’ pay – this is all about the MUA wanting to maintain their stranglehold and control of the Australian waterfront.” The ACTU’s O’Neil said the FWC’s decision in the Aurizon case in 2015 made applying for termination more attractive to employers because it “set a bizarre precedent that somehow said that forcing unions and workers to bargain from the bare minimum was somehow in the public interest”. “We reject that,” she said. “What it saw was a massive escalation in the number of companies that then tried to use this tactic. “It’s something that really puts a gun to the head of workers in the sense that it is such an extreme action. You can imagine the impact it would have where workers are told their simple choice is either go backwards by up to 50% of your wages, or agree with the deal we want.” The chief executive of industry body Australian Industry Group, Innes Willox, denied that employers were responsible for a surge in termination applications over the past few years. “Unions and some political parties like to argue that applications by employers to terminate enterprise agreements are common, but this is not supported by the facts,” he said. He said the number of contested applications had fallen in the past six years. “Nearly all of the applications made to terminate enterprise agreements are not contested,” he said. “Also, of the contested matters, most applications are made by unions and employees, not employers.”",News/Australia news,"Employers ‘rushing’ to terminate enterprise agreements, Australian unions say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/22/employers-rushing-to-terminate-enterprise-agreements-australian-unions-say
1/22/2022,"For some, a weak pelvic floor looks like leaking a little urine with a cough or sneeze. For others, it is experiencing pelvic organ prolapse or incontinence. Usually, weak pelvic floor muscles appear in people who have been through menopause or pregnancy, or who experience constant constipation, coughing or heavy lifting. But Janie Thompson, manager of the National Continence Helpline, says care of the pelvic floor is “important for everyone”.  Your pelvic floor is crucial to everyday bodily functions. Made up of muscle and tissue between the tailbone and pelvis, the pelvic floor supports the bladder, uterus and bowels. It also stabilises core strength, and supports sexual functions such as orgasm. Although your pelvic floor muscles are not “obvious”, Thompson says they are “important” to exercise as “the base of your core”. Working on exercise movements for pelvic floor muscles is “a bit like weight lifting”, she explains. Thompson’s top tip is to build pelvic floor exercises into your daily routine. “Think about something you do every day”, like boiling a kettle, taking medication or visiting the toilet, she says. Then, treat that daily action like a “prompt” to do an exercise. For women, Thompson says pelvic floor exercises should feel like “winking your vagina”. While sitting, standing or lying on your back, think of the muscles you would tighten to stop urinating or passing wind. Once located, squeeze the muscles and hold for three to five seconds. “Think of pulling the vagina up,” she explains of the gentle, upwards lifting movement you should feel when completing the exercise. After squeezing, release to feel the tension go. Be sure to rest for a few seconds between each squeeze, and try repeating up to 10 times. For men, the exercise is similar. “Try to pull your penis into your body. You want to feel your scrotum curling up.” “Think about lifting your penis up, and then the feeling of letting go. You will feel a release in your penis.” Thompson’s final piece of advice is to always “seek help” from specialists at the National Continence Helpline if ever in doubt of pelvic floor function. “Young people might not know what is normal, or that there is anything wrong,” she says, of undetected pelvic floor weakness or problems. “It is better to seek help sooner rather than later.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Easy wins: strengthen your pelvic floor a little more every day,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/22/easy-wins-strengthen-your-pelvic-floor-a-little-more-every-day
1/22/2022,"When Mark McGowan stood up on Thursday evening to announce that Western Australia would continue to be sealed off from a Covid-infected outside world, the reaction was swift. But it was by no means one-way traffic. Opinions on the dramatic backflip – cancelling the state’s planned 5 February reopening – were split down familiar faultlines, with business advocates and the Tourism Council crying out in financial pain while health workers breathed a sigh of relief.  The backdrop to WA’s U-turn was a record 88 deaths in one day across the nation. The New South Wales chief health officer, Kerry Chant, warned that fatalities there were likely to remain high for some time. If WA had lifted its restrictions and quarantine arrangements on 5 February as planned, modelling suggested the highly infectious Omicron Covid variant could tear through the state and peak at as high as 60,000 cases a day – 10 times the Delta forecasts, according to the Australian Medical Association WA president, Mark Duncan-Smith. Surging Covid numbers were a daunting prospect for frontline workers complaining that WA’s “underfunded” health system was already in crisis, even without widespread Covid infections. Duncan-Smith wanted better preparations and restrictions, rather than postponing border reopening and possibly moving the peak into winter. But McGowan says WA hospitals are as ready as they can be after the state pumped $3.2bn into beds, doctors and nurses during the past 12 months. Postponing the border reopening is an admission that the health system has failed, the WA opposition leader and Nationals MP, Mia Davies, says. “They have squandered the luxury of time to prepare our state for Omicron and Covid arriving,” Davies said. “He has left us with more questions than answers.” With no Covid patients currently in WA hospitals, McGowan wants 80-90% of Western Australians to be triple vaccinated – instead of the previously mandated double dose – before lifting the hard border. He says advice from his chief health officer is that this will increase Omicron protection from 4% to 64% in a state with the some of the most remote locations, across one of the largest landmass jurisdictions, in the world. WA currently has some of the lowest Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander vaccination rates, with 61% aged 16 and over partially vaccinated and just 43% double vaccinated. “I know I’m getting a lot of criticism. What we’re trying to do is save lives and save jobs at the same time,” McGowan said. “A lot of people say we should be living with Covid. Well, there are 752 people in the eastern states no longer living with Covid,” he said, referring to the number of Australian Covid deaths so far in 2022. “You should ask their families whether we should deliberately infect large numbers of West Australians.” But for many of WA’s 2.7 million residents – who for nearly two years followed the rules and got vaccinated because they were told it was a path to freedom – McGowan’s broken promise is a hard pill to swallow. Some say they were sold a lie, while others are struck overseas or interstate, unable to afford the time and cost of the sudden change to 5 February quarantine rules.

That is not actually true,” he said. The Tourism Council CEO, Evan Hall, says businesses that rely on international and interstate guests are already struggling to survive, and are now facing financial ruin. “Tourism businesses are reeling from the impacts of the indefinite border announcement and are receiving mass cancellations of events, tours and holiday bookings. They are facing a financial crisis,” Hall says. “We are looking at a genuine major compensation package for any tourism business that trusted in the planned opening dates.” But Duncan-Smith says the decision is not black and white. “Only government can make this decision because they are the only ones with all the information,” he says. “You have to factor in vaccination rates and effectiveness, availability, delivery of vaccines, school and health preparedness, and rapid antigen test availability. “It’s incredibly complex and the number of people with Omicron in WA is doubling every three days,” Duncan-Smith Says. He urged the government to set a reopening date. “I think that having an open-ended delay from a psychological point of view is not going to be good for society.” There are currently 1,348 active Covid cases in WA, with 24 in hotel quarantine. On Friday McGowan ruled that masks must be worn at all Australia Day public events to tackle a growing Covid cluster of four cases with unknown origins. The WA nursing union state secretary, Mark Olson, has labelled the border backflip a lifesaving move, saying there is a lack of hospital beds. “I know he is going to cop a lot of flak for it, but it’s the right decision at this time,” Olson says. “We can have a debate about whether the health system is broken. The government will say that it is fine; we will say there are some major structural issues that have arisen after four years of underfunding. I think we can both agree that the health system is not up to dealing with Omicron.”",News/Australia news,‘He has pulled the rug’: Mark McGowan’s backflip on Covid reopening splits WA,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/22/he-has-pulled-the-rug-mark-mcgowans-backflip-on-covid-reopening-splits-wa
1/22/2022,"Majid and Malek Moustafa have one hope for the coming school year – that they will not have to go back into lockdown. “I hope that we this year can just go along with school and do my soccer and stuff and all that just pretty normally,” Majid, 13, says. He does not want a repeat of his first two years at Keilor Downs college in Melbourne’s north-western suburbs, “having lockdowns and having to keep going in and out and having to worry about spreading Covid or getting Covid.”  Malek, aged eight, has had his first vaccination appointment and is due to start playing soccer again next month. Majid is already back at soccer training three days a week. “It’s a really good thing for us because we don’t stay on the technology like we did in lockdown,” Malek says. The school year in Victoria is scheduled to begin in the week of 31 January. In every state except Western Australia, students and teachers will return to in-classroom lessons against a backdrop of thousands of new Covid-19 cases per day. Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, says the “trade-off” for returning to school will be an increase in Covid transmission, but claims Australia’s already struggling health system will be able to cope. “All my colleagues in the states and territories agree that the most important thing is to get schools back,” Kelly says. Most teachers, parents, and students agree – remote learning is not a long-term solution. But some are frustrated that schools are still not set up to minimise the risk of airborne viruses, and angry that teachers have been told not to isolate if they are a close contact. Others are and concerned that the rollout of vaccines in children aged five to 12 was so delayed that kids are only just getting their first dose. As of Friday, 75.5% of kids aged 12-15 have had two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, and 24% of kids aged five to 12 have had one dose. The interval between doses for younger children is eight weeks. Prof Fiona Russell, a senior principal research fellow at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute and the University of Melbourne, says many children in Melbourne and Sydney will already have contracted the virus before school begins. Russell says there is limited child-specific data on the effectiveness of the vaccine against Omicron, but there is evidence that a single dose will provide protection against severe disease. Attending school is not necessarily any higher risk than mixing in any other setting, she says. “The highest risk is really in the home,” she says. “With Omicron everywhere that is a substantial way that everyone is getting it right now, in the household. There definitely will be school outbreaks and infections in schools, but that is why it is absolutely important that parents, grandparents, and teachers are all fully vaccinated and have had their boosters.” Russell says that Covid is likely to circulate in schools for at least the next 12 months, so it is critical that schools have plans to provide a relief workforce for teachers who are sick or isolating. “There will be teachers who test positive and some of them will be symptomatic,” she says. “There has to be a plan for that.” Some teachers told Guardian Australia they have quit over concerns about how the outbreak was being managed. Karen McVean left her teaching job at a Sydney school in June 2021, at the start of the Delta outbreak in New South Wales. Her husband, also a teacher, decided to retire early. “I didn’t feel that it was being taken seriously,” McVean says. “The government wasn’t setting guidelines that were in any way adequate to keep the teachers safe, to keep the students safe … I was made to feel quite uncomfortable where I was challenging things. It was just easier to leave.” McVean is one of the founding members of advocacy group Covid-Safe Schools. It is calling on state governments to put C02 filters and air filters in all rooms of all schools. “We want the schools to remain open,” McVean says. “I don’t want my children to have a weird little life wrapped up at home in cotton wool, but at the same token I expect that when they go to school they are going to be kept safe.” She plans to keep her youngest child, aged six, at home until two weeks after their first vaccine appointment. Her eldest child, who starts high school this year and is double-vaccinated, will be back on day one. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning McVean says the debate around schools has become defined in “black and white terms”, as if the only options are to open up or shut down, when the focus should be on reducing the risk of transmission. “We have known the virus is airborne for more than a year … there’s no reason that teachers should have to go off into an unsafe workplace,” she says. “It’s just unacceptable, it’s egregious.” The Victorian department of education says it will have installed 51,000 air purifiers in all government and low-fee independent schools by the start of term one. The NSW department of education did not answer a question from Guardian Australia on its use of air filters, instead providing a general statement saying the Covid-19 settings for schools were yet to be finalised. “Schools will be made Covid-safe through a combination of physical distancing, mask wearing, strict hygiene practices and frequent cleaning of schools,” the department said. States and territories are expected to released their plans for the return to school this week. Dr Nusrat Homaira, a senior lecturer and paediatric respiratory epidemiologist at the University of New South Wales, said ventilation policies and rapid antigen tests should form part of schools’ Covid-safe plans. But she says the rollout of ventilation guidelines in NSW has “not been very homogenous”. “We cannot underscore the importance of the return to schools enough. The benefits of that far outweigh the risks,” she says. Homaira says weekly surveillance testing of students and staff, at least during the heat of an outbreak, could be useful. Ines, a maths teacher from south-western Sydney who asked that her full name not be used, says she is frustrated that the plan is being announced so close to the start of term. It is as if governments have forgotten that teachers use the school holidays to prepare. “We’ve got one week left before we start … and at the moment I have been preparing for face-to-face teaching,” she says. “But if we have to pivot to online that is a completely different set of resources.” Ines, who is also a parent to two school-aged children, says she wants to go back to teaching in person. But she is worried about high levels of absences. “Especially in maths, but it’s in every [key learning area], the continuity of learning – or lack of – means that students will have gaps in their knowledge that will haunt them for years,” she says. “We can’t pretend that everything is alright and continue everything face-to-face that a high number of students are not there.” She is concerned that the decision to make teachers keep working even if they are a household contact of a Covid case will cause the virus to rip through the school. “That was the moment that my husband suggested that I quit my job,” she says. “It’s health behind the economy … our health doesn’t matter because we are not generating any GDP.” She says prime minister Scott Morrison’s decision to frame schools as a place where children go so their parents can go to work and power the economy was insulting. “They think that we are babysitters and anyone can do this job,” she says. Lorna, a mother of two from Wollongong, who asked that her name be changed because she is a public servant, is also frustrated at the slow government response. She is worried it could mean a return to remote schooling. “I could not handle a return to remote schooling, and the person who would suffer is my child,” she says. Supporting a primary-school aged child with remote learning is too much to manage while also working full time. “What ends up happening is that you give up and your child gives up.”",News/Australia news,"As Australian students prepare to leave Covid lockdowns in the past, teachers are frustrated by the lack of planning ",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/22/as-australian-students-prepare-to-leave-covid-lockdowns-in-the-past-teachers-are-frustrated-by-the-lack-of-planning
1/22/2022,"Australia’s medicines regulator has approved the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine for use in adults. Nuvaxovid received provisional approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration on Thursday, making it the fourth vaccine to be included in Australia’s rollout and the country’s first approved protein-based Covid vaccine.   Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The health minister, Greg Hunt, said on Thursday he hoped Novavax’s approval would encourage vaccine-hesitant people – around 1 million adults that comprise less than 5% of the over-16 population – to get the jab. “We have a first-dose national vaccination rate of 95.2%,” Hunt said. “Some people have waited for Novavax and although we’ve encouraged everyone to proceed, we recognise that that’s a fact.” How does the Novavax jab differ from other Covid-19 vaccines and will it make a difference to vaccination rates? The Novavax jab is a protein subunit vaccine. It contains a non-infectious component on the surface of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which induces a protective immune response when the body’s immune cells come into contact with it. “The technology on which Novavax is made is an older technology,” John Skerritt, head of the TGA, said on Thursday. “There are some individuals and there’s even social media groups who have, for whatever reason, been worried about new technology, even though the foundational technology for messenger RNA vaccines, such as Pfizer and Moderna, and for adenovirus vaccines, such as AstraZeneca, have been around for some years,” he said. Nuvaxovid is produced by genetic engineering and is grown in moth cells. “It’s not exactly something that you’re directly taking from nature,” Skerritt said in an interview with the ABC. Silvia Taylor, a senior vice-president at Novavax, described the vaccine as using a “tried and true technology platform”. Other protein subunit viruses vaccines include one for hepatitis B. Taylor said on Friday that Novavax believed its Covid vaccine was “a great choice” for “those who may be vaccine hesitant or looking for additional options”. Skerritt said Novavax provided “further choice” to people who had not yet received a Covid-19 vaccination. “I would have had literally several hundred emails and groups who’ve said for whatever reason, ‘we’d like to have a protein vaccine’. “Our dream is that we might turn our 95% [vaccination rate] up to 97 or 98% in this country.” Assoc Prof Holly Seale, an infectious disease social scientist at the University of New South Wales, said it was difficult to know what proportion of the unvaccinated population was holding out for Novavax. “Having this fourth vaccine in our repertoire – I’m happy to be wrong [but] I’m not sure if it’s going to make a big dent in the numbers,” she said. Seale, who has interviewed Covid vaccine refusers as part of her research, said a small group of people were waiting for Novavax based on “sentiment that this vaccine represents something more traditional or aligned with vaccines that have been previously used in Australia”. It may be founded on misunderstandings about the vaccine, such as the belief that Novavax is “more natural” than mRNA vaccines, she said. “We certainly do want to encourage people who have been waiting to get the vaccine,” she said. “We also need to make sure that people aren’t going about with misunderstandings and have been holding out for a vaccine when really they could be receiving one of the other vaccines … that are already out there.” The TGA’s approval is for a primary course – two doses – of the Novavax vaccine in people aged 18 and over. Subject to consideration by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, the vaccine will be available in the coming weeks, Hunt said on Thursday. The federal government announced an advanced purchase agreement last January for 51m doses of the vaccine, with the first shipment expected to arrive in the country in the next month.",News/Australia news,Novavax Covid vaccine: what is it and will it make a difference?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/22/novavax-covid-vaccine-what-is-it-and-will-it-make-a-difference
1/22/2022,"Hip-hop group the Fugees have cancelled the reunion tour planned to celebrate the 25th anniversary of their acclaimed album The Score due to ongoing pandemic challenges, the group announced Friday. “The continued Covid pandemic has made touring conditions difficult, and we want to make sure we keep our fans and ourselves healthy and safe,” the group, which consists of Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean and Pras Michel, said in a statement posted to Instagram. “If opportunity, public safety, and scheduling allow, we hope to be able to revisit this again sometime soon.”  The 12-city tour, announced in September 2021, was heralded with a concert in New York (that started, in typical Fugees fashion, three and half hours late), the group’s first in 15 years. “We’re grateful for the special night we did get to share with you in New York, with that rare live moment,” they said in the statement, but concluded it “may not currently be our time for revisiting this past work”. The Score, released to critical acclaim in 1996, earned two Grammy awards and made the Fugees the first hip-hop group to be nominated for album of the year. The album, featuring hit singles Ready or Not and Killing Me Softly, was also a commercial smash, selling over 22m copies worldwide. It was also their last album as a group. Hill went on to record The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill in 1998, which won five Grammys, while Jean and Michel both released several solo projects. The Fugees are not the only group thwarted by the challenges of putting on a live show during the omicron surge.

1/22/2022,"There’s a specific cruelty to modern dating, a seemingly unending grind of gut-punching disappointment and hurt, something that’s easily judged and lampooned by those no longer in the game but something that’s really only understood by those still playing. In first-time director Mimi Cave’s rattling debut Fresh, Noa (Normal People’s Daisy Edgar-Jones) is exhausted. In a believably odious first scene first date, she’s informed by her indoor scarf-wearing match that women are no longer as feminine as they should be, in all these comfy over-sized clothes, as he monologues to her about his passion for hot sauce. She leaves with a familiar eye-roll (he calls her a stuck-up bitch, natch) forced back to swiping for love but instead, being met with more unsolicited dick pics. It’s enough to make even the most romantic of romantics admit defeat.  When she meets Steve (Sebastian Stan) in the fresh produce aisle of the local supermarket, she’s caught off-guard by his charm, a handsome, keen and emotionally available stranger who talks as much as he listens. They begin dating and while her best friend Molly (Jojo T Gibbs) is alarmed by his lack of social media presence – a red flag in the 2020s, surely? – Noa allows herself to slowly believe that maybe she’s finally getting what she deserves. Steve surprises her with a weekend away but first, with traffic shifting their journey to morning, she’ll get to see his place for the first time. Remote and expansive (“This is intimidating,” she remarks), she can’t believe her luck. But after a few sips of an old-fashioned, Noa starts to feel woozy. Before she has time to process, it’s lights out and that’s just the first in a series of nasty surprises. The believable meet-cute first act takes place entirely, audaciously, before the opening credits, a sweet 30-minute romcom that quickly switches up to reveal something sour, like biting into a succulent peach that’s rotten on the inside. It would be a spoiler, I believe, to detail exactly what the big reveal is although Cave gives us ample warning signs: the title, the location of the initial meet, the references to food … the general nature of it isn’t a surprise but the specifics are, a bracingly nasty rug-pull detailed with chilling normality. While Fresh can be easily filed a part of the boom in “social thrillers”, exploding post the extraordinary success of Jordan Peele’s Oscar-winning Get Out, it’s one of the few that manages to grip us without the use of a heavy hand. What screenwriter Lauryn Kahn and Cave realise is that first and foremost, this is a genre movie, and rather than waste time patting themselves on the back for making clumsy “but this is really about” commentary, they’re too busy trying to make our palms sweat and our pulses race. While some of the plot details might skirt close to B-movie absurdity, Fresh exists in a real world with real people, rules and stakes. So when terrible things happen, we’re not dealing with just a surface wound. Kahn doesn’t take short cuts with her characters who, for the most part, avoid easily written yet hard-to-stomach behaviour. What might be a little harder to stomach for some though is just how queasily grotesque parts of the film are, whether we see the gore up close or not, but there’s something fitting about just how unapologetically gnarly it all is. Because such in-your-face exposure makes sense here. For many of us, and especially for women, dating apps and dating culture can be violently revealing, exposing people’s worst impulses and most selfish desires, and the film takes particular issue with how women’s bodies are judged, shared and abused. It’s a brutal snapshot but Kahn avoids disappearing into the but-what-next gloom of Promising Young Woman, which left us lost in hopelessness. There’s a similar war being fought here, between violent masculinity and the women trying to survive it, but there’s more to say than just: everyone is the worst. Fresh makes its point without feeling the need to bludgeon us in the process. Cave, best known for her music video work, keeps us in the moment without drowning us in poppy, over-styled otherness. She’s a deft orchestrator of suspense (expect any wise studio exec to be pestering her agent with calls immediately) but she also wants us to be part of it rather than watching at a distance and so using Edgar-Jones, a warm and empathetic yet spiky actor, is a masterstroke. She plays Noa as many women have to play themselves on the scene: vulnerable to not seem too standoffish to men craving someone to take care of but with enough steel to protect herself if needed. She sells every gruelling beat and her hot-and-cold chemistry with Stan, leaning into his dark side well, is one of the film’s major sources of propulsion. If the frenzied last act makes a few missteps (some decisions are a little questionable, Gibbs disappears for a little too long and one of the final quips is awkwardly on-the-nose), it’s all so thrillingly edge-of-seat that such quibbles are forgiven. For those who like their dating movies with a bit of gristle, Fresh is a perfect match.

1/22/2022,"Given the timing, it is impossible not to contrast the five-match Twenty20 series between England and West Indies that starts in Barbados on Saturday with the other five-match England series that has just concluded. Other than the badge on the touring players’ shirts the contrast is almost total and, having witnessed their compatriots crumble under the intense pressure of the Ashes, the white-ball squad can enjoy having very little of their own to cope with. As Eoin Morgan said on Friday: “I think the whole tour is one where the development of our game is more important than the series win.” Long, sandy beaches, warm weather and famously carefree spirit make the Caribbean the ideal place to escape from your troubles, but it is West Indies who have fresher scars to heal. The day after England’s fifth Test against Australia came to its ignominious conclusion in Hobart, Ireland won the deciding fixture of a three-match ODI series in Kingston. The home side’s captain, Kieron Pollard, admitted afterwards that he was “hurting, and hurting badly”. Meanwhile Sunday will mark three months since they were skittled for 55 by England in the opening game of a miserable defence of their Twenty20 World Cup title.  As with many great sides in sport, while other teams analysed their successful formula and improved on it, West Indies fell into the trap of assuming the same approach would continue to work and had no answer when, unexpectedly, it didn’t. Since winning four of five matches against Australia in July as they prepared for the World Cup they have lost eight and won just once – against an even more hapless Bangladesh side and by just three runs. They are currently ranked 10th in the format, just above Zimbabwe and Nepal. England, despite the disappointment of losing in the World Cup semi-finals, are top. This will be a different West Indies side from the one England thrashed in Dubai in October, and of the 16 players in their squad 10 were not involved in the UAE as anything more than travelling reserves. “It’s a difficult situation if we had the same team from the World Cup, but we have a lot of new faces and a lot of guys who want to make an impression and be part of the team going forward,” Phil Simmons, West Indies’ head coach, said this week. “So I think from that point of view it’s not as difficult as it would seem.” England have some familiar faces among their group – including Jofra Archer, who will not play but trained with the squad on Friday and even did some bowling in the nets, albeit very slowly and mostly with his left arm – and others less well-known such as Harry Brook, George Garton and David Payne, who are yet to play any international cricket, as well as Phil Salt, who having spent much of his childhood in Barbados should be particularly at home here. All will have their sights set on a place on the plane to Australia this October, and with the multi-format players resting after the Ashes and Liam Livingstone missing at least the first match because of a non-Covid illness most will get a chance to shine, even if Morgan insisted that “I think for this tour it’s actually looking beyond the [next] World Cup”. England’s first match of that tournament, in a group that also contains both 2021 finalists Australia and New Zealand, comes precisely nine months after the first match of this series, a period likely to be marked by no more than gentle evolution. “We know our guys play really well in Australia,” Morgan said. “Looking towards our strongest squad, or our tactics, our strategy, it makes us feel a little bit more at ease than planning for conditions that we might not go into as one of the favourites. We know what works in Australia so the method that we’re trying to implement will be very, very similar to the method that we’ve used.” It is hard to know whether yet more international cricket is the last thing England needs at this moment of misery-enforced introspection, or if it might provide the ideal tonic. “We will try to go out and enjoy ourselves, play with smiles on our faces,” Morgan said. “If we enjoy ourselves, hopefully other people will enjoy watching us play.",Sport/Sport,Morgan’s men bid to lift the dark clouds hovering over English cricket,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/21/morgans-men-bid-to-lift-the-dark-clouds-hovering-over-english-cricket
1/22/2022,"Allegations this week that party whips have attempted to blackmail MPs to protect Boris Johnson have had some clutching at their pearls in mock horror – and others genuinely distressed by what they regard as a blend of bribery and bullying that could require police investigation. The role of a party whip down the decades has been to secure the government’s business and the protect the prime minister. They are portrayed as democracy’s unsung heroes, as necessary as sewers for civilisation.  In the job description there is no exact rulebook as to what is off-limits. As in most walks of life, persuasion can take many forms, from low-grade patronage to flattery; a filthy look; intimidation, mainly verbal; or more agreeably permission to go on a two-week fact-finding tour with the all-party UK-Bali parliamentary association. It is pretty routine for MPs ahead of a vote to be reminded of the pending link-road scheme in their constituency. But one former chief whip looking at the current controversy claims the dividing line on legitimate persuasion is nevertheless clear. “Yes to threats on preferment and honours. No to abusing public money and private lives.” The Tory MPs who spoke out on Thursday claim the threats, including withheld investment in a school, fell into the latter category. No 10 insisted: “We are not aware of any evidence to support what are clearly serious allegations. If there is any evidence to support these claims we would look at it very carefully.” It is even more controversial if MPs’ private lives are dragged into the discussion. In the past whips’ interest in MPs’ private lives was largely pastoral – to ensure damaging information about their flock does not reach the public domain. But privileged information of this sort – about drunkenness, infidelity and indiscretions – can also be passed, or threatened to be passed, to the press. Andrew Mitchell, a former chief whip, in his recent memoir Beyond a Fringe discloses not only did Tory whips have a notebook containing all sorts of indiscretions, but this was as a matter of course sent to John Major, the prime minister – and a former whip himself. In a 1995 BBC documentary, Westminster’s Secret Service, Tim Fortescue, a whip under Ted Heath between 1970 and 1973, explained: “Anyone with any sense who was in trouble would come to the whips and tell them the truth, and say now, I’m in a jam, can you help? It might be debt, it might be … a scandal involving small boys, or any kind of scandal. “And we would do everything we can because we would store up brownie points … and if I mean, that sounds a pretty, pretty nasty reason, but it’s one of the reasons because if we could get a chap out of trouble then he will do as we ask forever more.” But just as a whip likes nothing more than an MP with a debt of gratitude, conversely there is nothing they fear more than an MP with no sense of obligation. Mitchell recounts once seeking the vote of a pro-European, Sir Peter Tapsell, only for the larger-than-life MP to turn on him and say: “You see Andrew, there is nothing I want from your office. I am rich – very rich – I am already a knight and I certainly have no wish whatsoever to be a member of this benighted government. The only thing I want is my dead son back and there is nothing you can do about that.” For some MPs the task of being a whip is a profession, a calling, an ability to see around corners and read personalities. The old cliche about the Labour whips’ office was that it was staffed by many working-class MPs with a union background delivering the votes required for policies conceived by a Balliol-educated cabinet. In the Tory whips’ office by contrast the style is a mix of a military background and an academy for fast-tracked MPs heading up the ranks of government. Between the two whips’ offices there is also an esprit de corps across enemy lines – born of a respect for their mutual task of shepherding their wayward flock through the division lobbies. Critical to the success of a whipping operation is the relationship of trust between the prime minister and the chief whip. One former whip said: “It is essential that you can go to the PM and say ‘This is not going to work,’ and then to be taken seriously.” Stanley Baldwin indeed wrote an emotional letter to his chief whip, David Margesson, telling him that “there is no relationship between men so close as that of a prime minister and his chief whip”. In reality that is not always true. Martin Redmayne, chief whip during the Profumo affair, thought Harold Macmillan should resign – and engineered for Douglas Home to succeed him. Tim Renton was a curious choice of chief whip for Margaret Thatcher. In 1989 he was an ally of Sir Geoffrey Howe, pro-European, urbane and socially liberal, three things she had come to hate. After her downfall she blamed him for giving a “characteristically dispiriting assessment” of her chances in a second ballot. He was one of those she had in mind in referring to “treachery with a smile on its face”. Renton maintained in leadership contests the whips’ office must be neutral, a tradition that has got lost at present. Regardless of whether MPs are more independent-minded now – on which there is conflicting evidence – the consensus is that the era of the macho whip has ended. Labour has had three female chief whips in recent years, reflecting a wider change in political culture. If it emerges the whips, under chief whip Mark Spencer, have overstepped the mark, and even that recordings have been made, it will be an extraordinary moment, not just for Boris Johnson but the future of parliament.",News/Politics,The discreet art of whipping: what are the limits for parliament’s enforcers?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/21/the-discreet-art-of-whipping-what-are-the-limits-for-parliaments-enforcers
