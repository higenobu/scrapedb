2/18/2022,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A family that died of heat exhaustion during a grueling summer hike in Northern California sent a last, desperate text pleading for help, authorities said Thursday. The Mariposa County Sheriff's Office released information pulled from the cellphone of Jonathan Gerrish after months of work with an FBI forensics team. One text made shortly before noon on Aug. 15 to a person whose name wasn't released asked: “Can you help us” and added: “No water or ver (over) heating with baby,"" the San Francisco Chronicle reported. But the area had bad cellphone service and the text never went through. Neither did five phone calls to various people, investigators said. Ellen Chung, 31, her 45-year-old husband, their 1-year-old daughter Aurelia “Miju” Chung-Gerrish, and their dog Oski were found dead on a hiking trail near the Merced River last August. Their deaths baffled investigators. The case involved more than 30 law enforcement agencies that had painstakingly reviewed — and ruled out — causes such as murder, lightning strikes, poisoning from algae-tainted water, abandoned mines that might emit toxic gas, illegal drugs and suicide. Last fall, investigators concluded that the family died of extreme heat stroke. Temperatures that afternoon reached 109 degrees Fahrenheit (43 Celsius) in the steep mountain terrain and the family had run out of water. A wildfire had burned off any shade canopy. Officials found the family two days later after relatives had reported them missing. The family had hiked 6.4 miles (2.5 kilometers) with the baby in a backpack-type carrier. They were 1.6 miles (2.5 kilometers) away from their car. The family had an 85-ounce (2.5-liter) water container with them that was empty. The cellphone was found in Gerrish's pocket. Beginning shortly after noon, Gerrish and Chung tried to call and text for help several times, according to the Sheriff's Office. Five phone calls — four of them made in rapid succession — went to several phone numbers but the family didn't call 911, the Sheriff's Office said. The first call was made at 12:09 p.m. Beginning at 12:35 p.m., the family made the final four calls in rapid succession, investigators said. However, none of the calls connected.",U.S./Associated Press,Family that died in California mountains made desperate plea,https://news.yahoo.com/family-died-california-mountains-made-042534404.html
2/18/2022,"BEIJING — International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said Friday that he was ""very disturbed"" by Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva's disastrous performance the night before, while also ripping members of her inner circle who did not visibly support her. In his first comments on the Valieva story, which he called ""very sad,"" Bach said he watched Thursday night's long program on television and was struck by the pressure that Valieva, 15, must have been feeling. He said he struggled to watch her struggle through her program and repeatedly try to compose herself. ""This pressure is beyond my imagination, and particular for a girl of 15 years old,"" he said. Bach also ripped Valieva's ""closest entourage,"" in an apparent nod to her controversial coach, Eteri Tutberidze. Immediately after Valieva's performance, which dropped her from first place to fourth, TV cameras captured Tutberidze asking critical questions of her 15-year-old pupil. According to Russian news outlets, she asked Valieva, ""Why did you stop fighting? Explain it to me, why?"" Bach said it struck him as ""tremendous coldness."" ""It was chilling to see this, rather than giving her comfort, rather than to try to help her,"" he said. ""All of this does not give me much confidence in this closest entourage of Kamila, neither with regard to what happened in the past nor as far as it concerns the future, how to deal, how to address, how to treat a minor athlete at the age of 15 under such an obvious mental stretch. I can only wish for her that she has the support of her family, the support of her friends and the support of people who help her (overcome) this extremely difficult situation."" MEDAL COUNT: How every country has performed at the Beijing Olympic Games. OPINION: Kamila Valieva was failed by the adults in her life – and it showed in Olympic meltdown Valieva has faced unrelenting scrutiny over the past week after testing positive for a banned heart medication. She was provisionally suspended by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency, then reinstated by a disciplinary panel, then cleared to compete by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The case has been particularly complex given exemptions in the anti-doping rules for minors, who are considered ""protected persons."" Bach said the Valieva scenario has also raised questions about whether there should be a minimum age limit for Olympic competition. He said discussions over the issue have already begun in the IOC's executive board. ""But this needs careful deliberation,"" he said. ""It needs consultation on two fronts: The one is with regard to WADA, to see whether there is the need to adapt the rules. The other stakeholder is the international federations, whether the establishment of a minimum age for participation is an appropriate measure. ""We will initiate such a discussion and at least give them some food for thought.""

2/18/2022,"American-born skier Eileen Gu defended her decision to compete for China at the Beijing Olympics despite China’s human rights abuses on Thursday, saying she is “not trying to solve political problems right now.” “People sometimes don’t know what to do with other people when they’re not fitting in a box,” she told reporters after the qualifying round in the ski halfpipe. “They say, ‘Is she Chinese? Is she American? Is she a model? Is she a student? Why is she trying to change the world when she’s only 18?’” Gu, who won gold in the women’s freestyle and silver in the women’s slopestyle, was born in San Francisco but has chosen to compete for China, her mother’s native country. The decision has drawn criticism from many Americans who say it is unconscionable to represent China, given the country’s various human rights abuses, including the ongoing genocide it’s prosecuting against Uyghur Muslims. Gu has avoided questions about her citizenship since winning gold; China does not allow dual citizenship, raising questions over whether the 18-year-old relinquished her American citizenship to compete for China. Chinese state media has reported that Gu became a Chinese national three years ago. While announcing her decision in 2019, Gu professed to be “proud of [her] heritage, and equally proud of [her] American upbringings.” She added that the “opportunity to help inspire millions of young people where my mom was born, during the 2022 Beijing Olympic Winter Games is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help to promote the sport I love.” Gu has said she has spent at least a quarter of her life in China and has said her hope is to get more girls and women to participate in winter sports. China also aims to inspire 300 million to participate in winter sports. “My biggest goal is for some girl to be sitting at home watching freeskiing for the first time and thinking, ‘maybe that could be me some day.’ Maybe she sees someone who looks like her doing it and thinks, ‘Hey, I can do that, too,'” Gu said. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has criticized the 18-year-old skier, accusing her of “standing for human rights abuses.” “In terms of the citizenship, look, China or the U.S.? You have got to pick a side. Period,” asserted Haley in an interview with Real Clear Politics. “You’ve got to pick a side because you’re either American or you’re Chinese, and they are two very different countries… Every athlete needs to know when they put their flag on, you’re standing for freedom or you’re standing for human rights abuses. There is no in-between.” China Says Foreign Athletes May Face Punishment for Political Statements during Olympics NBC Takes a ‘Both-Sides’ Approach to Chinese Human-Rights Abuses during Olympics Opening Ceremony Pelosi Warns Olympic Athletes against Protesting China at Beijing Games",World/National Review,American-Born Olympic Skier Defends Decision to Compete for China,https://news.yahoo.com/american-born-olympic-skier-defends-133259782.html
2/18/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan set a new record for daily deaths from COVID-19 in a wave of Omicron-fuelled fatalities that a government-affiliated researcher estimated may stretch into April. Newly recorded fatalities rose to 271 on Thursday, according to a tally by national broadcaster NHK, the third straight day over 200. There have been 2,446 deaths so far in February, already the second-deadliest month in the two-year pandemic. A panel of health experts said this week that a surge of cases caused by the infectious Omicron variant appears to have peaked out, but hospitalisations and deaths would likely continue, particularly among the elderly. Kyoto University professor Hiroshi Nishiura estimated that the Omicron wave would claim 4,339 lives between January and April 20, with more than 70% of the victims in their 80s or older. That number could be reduced depending on the progression of booster shots, acccording to Nishiura. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has pledged to accelerate Japan's booster shot programme, which has so far reached just 12% of the population.
