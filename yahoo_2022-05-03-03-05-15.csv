5/3/2022,"When we were reading through real estate data this month, three stats caught our eye. The first: That the number of active foreclosures (this is when the foreclosure process has begun on a seriously delinquent loan, but it has yet to be completed and liquidated) edged up by more than 7,000 in March — the first year-over-year increase in almost 10 years, according to mortgage technology, data and analytics provider Black Knight. Secondly, more than 78,000 U.S. properties had a foreclosure filing during the first quarter of 2022, which is up 39% from the previous quarter and up 132% from a year ago, according to real estate analytics company ATTOM.",Business/MarketWatch•yesterday,Foreclosure filings are up 132% from a year prior.

5/3/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- After complaining for years that high valuations were thwarting his stock-buying efforts, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is back hoovering up other companies’ shares. Most Read from Bloomberg Biggest Treasury Buyer Outside U.S. Quietly Selling Billions Bored Ape Metaverse Frenzy Raises Millions, Crashes Ethereum Naomi Judd, of Grammy-Winning Duo The Judds, Dies at 76 End of Easy Money Brings a $410 Billion Global Financial Shock Stocks Wobble With 10-Year Bond Yield Close to 3%: Markets Wrap The conglomerate made roughly $41 billion of net purchases in the first quarter, including a boost to its Chevron Corp. stake that vaulted the investment into Berkshire’s top four common stock holdings. Buffett also disclosed that the company now holds an expanded 9.5% stake in Activision Blizzard Inc. stock -- an arbitrage bet on the video-game maker in the midst of being acquired by Microsoft Corp. Berkshire hasn’t been this significant of a net buyer of common stocks in any quarter in data going back to 2008. Buffett’s flurry of activity in recent months fueled a number of questions from shareholders on Saturday at its first in-person annual meeting since 2019. The gathering, held in Buffett’s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, lasted hours as the chief executive officer and his business partner Charlie Munger fielded questions about markets, nuclear weapons and even Bitcoin. They were joined on stage by two key deputies, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, who answered questions about the railroad, cyber attacks and auto insurers. Last year, Abel was officially confirmed as the heir apparent to take over as Berkshire CEO from Buffett when he decides to step down. But Saturday’s event was still dominated by Buffett, 91, and Munger, 98, who both gave no indication that they plan to step back from their roles anytime soon. Both executives have slightly lessened other duties in recent years, with Buffett announcing that this year’s charity lunch auction will be his last after more than two decades and Munger relinquishing his chairman title at the Daily Journal Corp. Buffett and his deputies have struggled in recent years to find ways to put Berkshire’s cash to work in higher-returning assets, due in part to stiff competition from buyers including private equity firms as well as high valuations. But the Berkshire executives were back in action during the first three months of the year, adding more Occidental Petroleum Corp. shares and striking an agreement to buy Alleghany Corp. for $11.6 billion in cash in a deal expected to close in the fourth quarter. That’s in addition to the newly ramped-up Chevron and Activision bets. “We have so much trouble finding new ideas we find it hard to ignore any,” Buffett said at the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. Any deal by the conglomerate “has to be sizable now,” he said. Berkshire’s massive common equity holding in Occidental was one of its biggest disclosed purchases in the first quarter, and came on top of the $10 billion Berkshire had already invested in the oil producer years back. Buffett noted that the investment came together quickly after he spent a weekend reading a presentation from Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub. “What Vicki Hollub was saying made nothing but sense and I decided it was a good place to put Berkshire’s money,” Buffett said. “And two weeks later we had 14% of the company.” Berkshire’s substantial investment in Chevron during the quarter combined with its $10 billion investment in Occidental’s preferred shares add up to a $40 billion bet on the oil sector, said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones. Cash Pile The purchases helped chip away at Berkshire’s cash pile, which ended the first quarter at $106 billion, the lowest since the third quarter of 2018. The hoard had been trending at near-record levels in recent quarters. As Berkshire revved up its stock-buying engine, the company slowed its roll on share repurchases during the quarter with just $3.2 billion of stock buybacks, the lowest since the same period in 2020 and down from the $6.9 billion repurchased during the last three months of 2021. Buffett had increasingly leaned on repurchases as one way to put money to work in a competitive dealmaking environment. Berkshire’s Class A shares were more expensive during the period, with a gain of more than 17% during the first quarter. The conglomerate eked out a profit gain of just 0.3% to $7.04 billion in the first quarter compared to the same period a year earlier. While the manufacturers and retailers were strong during the period, underwriting at the insurers was softer this quarter. Get More Berkshire’s press release is here. Bloomberg will be liveblogging the annual meeting here. (Updates with Activision details in second paragraph, lack of succession talk in fourth paragraph.)

5/3/2022,"By Ann Saphir and Lindsay Dunsmuir (Reuters) - In mid-April, months into an increasingly frustrating house hunt, Harsh Grewal and his wife settled on a place in a San Francisco suburb and were prepping a bid, above the listed price so they'd have a chance of besting other offers in one of the nation's hottest housing markets. Then he checked his phone and saw several alerts, all touting reduced prices for other homes they'd been tracking. The Grewals pulled their offer and put their search on ice in hopes it was a sign the market was finally cooling. ""I want to see where this goes, and where the dust settles,"" Grewal said. That's exactly what Federal Reserve policymakers hope to see more of as they raise interest rates to bring down 40-year high inflation. One leg of their effort is taking the heat out of the housing market, where low borrowing costs introduced to cushion the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic helped fuel a 35% rise in home prices over the past two years. While house prices are not part of the inflation indexes the Fed tracks, they do feed into other factors - such as rents - that are influential to inflation. Rising rates mean borrowing for a house is suddenly more expensive. The 10-year Treasury note yield, a benchmark for mortgage rates, has risen on expectations of swift Fed rate hikes. The average 30-year-fixed home loan rate is now 5.37%, up more than 2 percentage points since the year began, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. So buyers of a typical existing home, which went for $375,000 in March, will pay $440 more each month than they would have in December, if they put 20% down and borrow the rest at a fixed rate for a 30-year term. Higher interest rates account for most of that. Meanwhile inflation is also driving up grocery bills and gasoline costs. ""The housing market is definitely out of whack,"" said Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who recounted last month how he sold his St. Louis home to an all-cash buyer with no inspection. ""We'll see how the interest rates start cooling things off going forward."" New homebuyers face sharply higher costs https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/HOUSING/jnvwerjrevw/chart.png 'AN INFLECTION POINT' The last time mortgage rates rose this fast was in the spring of 1994. Total home sales fell 20% as the Fed lifted rates, and home price growth slowed. Economists predict a sales drop and slowing price growth this time, too, perhaps to a roughly 5% annual rate by year end. But an unprecedented collection of factors, including record-low housing stock, unusually high household savings, an extremely tight job market and increased worker mobility are creating crosscurrents that could blow that forecast off course. Sales of previously owned homes were the lowest in nearly two years in March, according to the National Association of Realtors. Mortgage applications are down as well. List-price drops like those the Grewals noticed are more common, accounting for 13% of homes for sale in the four weeks from mid-March to mid-April, according to real estate company Redfin, up from 9% a year earlier. At the same time, mortgage applications remain above pre-COVID levels, and house prices hit a record as homes were snatched up typically within 17 days of listing. Some of that could be a last-gasp effort of buyers, particularly those with pre-approved financing, racing to purchase homes before rates go even higher. ""The next couple of months things are going to heat up until we get to an inflection point,"" probably this summer, Zillow Economist Nicole Bachaud said. The soaring cost of home loans https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/HOUSING/byvrjnrlxve/chart.png THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT? The correlation between house price growth and mortgage rates, while still strong, has been declining though over the past 20 years, said Anne Thompson, a lecturer and research scientist at MIT who recently co-authored a paper with Yale University's Robert Shiller arguing that soaring prices do not appear to reflect a bubble. ""I wouldn't even necessarily call it a cooling, I'd call it a flattening of rates of appreciation, but not this year because there are still relatively low interest rates,"" Thompson said, noting that mortgage rates have historically been much higher. Many regional markets remain very hot, particularly in the South, helped by buyers having more flexibility on where they work as well as strong wage gains amid a shortage of workers. Those factors may also bolster housing sales even if higher rates take some of the steam out of price rises. Rob Lubow, 35, and his husband worked remotely from their two-bedroom Austin, Texas, rental apartment until late last year when Lubow's firm began calling employees back to the office. In January Lubow began looking for a new job that would let him work from home permanently. A month later he had one - and a 35% salary increase. Austin home prices had climbed way above their $300,000 maximum reach. The median home price was $624,000 in March, up from $415,000 two years earlier, data from the Austin Board of Realtors shows. Their remote-only jobs meant mobility, so last month they bought a three-bedroom house in Kingston, New York, for just under their budget. The median home price there is $280,000, according to Redfin, up almost 20% since last year. ""If people respond to higher housing costs by moving to more affordable places, that could lead to more home sales,"" Redfin Chief Economist Daryl Fairweather said. A near-record low number of homes are for sale https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/dwpkryrmavm/chart.png 'INSANE' Record low inventory over the past couple of years also means there is plenty of pent-up demand, particularly among Millennials ready to set up a home, whose share of purchases has been growing. But that is bumping up against Boomers, discouraged from downsizing by the rising costs of alternative housing, staying put and keeping the larger homes desired by younger people off the market at a time when too-few new homes are being built. Meanwhile, data from the Realtors group shows the share of all-cash sales was the largest in nearly eight years in March, a sign supply is being gobbled up by institutional investors or second-home buyers. Mike Wang, 33, works at a vitamin manufacturer and rents a Los Angeles apartment. He's had a number of promotions and now makes 50% more than he did three years ago. ""Even with making more money than I could have hoped for when I was 20-something, house prices have far outpaced that – which when I think about that I'm like, holy cow, that is insane."" So Wang says he sees little choice but to wait in the hope prices slow as predicted and he can catch up enough to buy a house in a few years. With so many people his age wanting to buy homes, and so few houses being built, he's not convinced it will happen that way. ""Having been surprised in the past, I wouldn't be surprised to see things buck all the analyst forecasts,"" Wang said.

5/3/2022,"This article first appeared in the Morning Brief. Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. Subscribe If I had to grade this weekend’s ""Woodstock of Capitalism"" – aka the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting – I would slap it with a solid B. Was this Buffett’s most headline-grabbing annual meeting? I have listened to/watched enough of these spectacles in the past decade to say emphatically: No. Personally, I liked his annual meeting in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic as he sought to rally the world. Sure, Buffett railed against Wall Street (he hates paying fees to bankers, as seen once more in the Allegheny deal) by saying it’s a “gambling parlor” and bitcoin for it offering nothing of value. He scared the hell out of everyone (again) on potential nuclear war. Charlie Munger flipped the bird to Robinhood (more on that below). But all of this felt very stale to me, just vintage Buffett and Munger. I would compare it to comedian Andrew Dice Clay going to his bag of nursery rhyme jokes to please long-time fans – they are proven winning lines. So from a headline standpoint, I give the annual meeting a solid C (tough grader I know, but whatever). Where Buffett earned his A grade, however, was in the investing wisdom he imparted on the crowd. Nothing new per se, rather great reminders one day after the Dow Jones Industrial tanked 900 points and the Nasdaq Composite fell 4%. Here are three lessons Buffett served up: 1. Do Your Research Buffett’s explanation on how he upped his stake in Occidental Petroleum to 14% of the company, underscored the need to do your own research and make it extensive if possible. Buffett saw 60% of the top holders in Occidental being no more than passive investors unlikely to take advantage of a dislocation in the stock price. So, Buffett saw that passiveness and a dislocation in the stock price, and went to work buying up everyone else’s shares not in that 60% group. Savvy. 2. Buy When Others Are Fearful Falling markets haven’t deterred Buffett. In fact, this is the perfect environment for him…and it could be for you as well, provided you can have a time horizon of more than one-day. Buffett spent $51 billion to buy stocks in the first quarter, notably HP, Chevron and the aforementioned Occidental. Ask yourself this question this morning: What would Warren Buffett be doing after Friday’s big down day in the markets? The answer is probably not preparing for a stock market crash because a free newsletter is warning of one (not this one of course). No, Buffett is probably licking his chops as names he is watching have just gotten cheaper. 3. Buy Stock of Companies You Understand Buffett mentioned he doesn’t know how to use email and has documents printed out for him. With that context, is it any surprise Buffett became the largest shareholder in printer maker HP in the first quarter? Nope. Meanwhile, Buffett has a unique view of demand for fossil fuels by way of his ownership of railroad Burlington Northern (and his other industrial companies). Is it any shock he's been plowing billions into Chevron and Occidental? Nope. Bottom line is Buffett has long purchased stocks of companies he understands. It’s a wise course of action for you as well. If you don’t understand what that $2 biotech stock you just bought really does, why are you buying it? Mesh the grades together, you get my solid B. Till next year Warren and Charlie (hopefully). Happy Trading! Trash talking: Charlie Munger didn’t show his age (98) when wasting no time ripping Robinhood a new one at the celebration of two billionaire investors. ""Wasn't that pretty obvious that something like that was going to happen?"" Munger said after bringing up Robinhood's business troubles, later adding the company's business model ""was disgusting... God is getting just. ... There's been some justice."" About seven hours after the comment, Robinhood’s head of public policy communications sent me this statement via email: “It is tiresome witnessing Mr. Munger mischaracterize a platform and customer base he knows nothing about. [No, Robinhood doesn’t charge commissions and does not allow day trading or short selling. We never did.] He should just say what he really means: unless you look, think, and act like him, you cannot and should not be an investor. We’re happy to share our educational tools, as it also seems he is lost on digital currencies.” Maybe a touch of age-shaming in the crypto reference? You be the judge. Somehow I don’t think Munger will be invited on as a Robinhood board advisor anytime soon. But maybe he should: Robinhood’s stock has crashed 72% since hitting public markets in July 2021. Thanks for nothing, Amazon: If Amazon’s first quarter loss were excluded, the S&P 500 would currently be sitting on double-digit percentage profit growth to start the year, points out FactSet. Including Amazon’s loss, the S&P 500’s first quarter earnings growth rate stands at 7.1% compared to 10.1% if Amazon were excluded. On another note, my co-anchor Julie Hyman and I got into a fiery debate on live TV on whether Amazon will raise prices on Prime again to help offset inflation. Julie says no, I say it’s going to $200 a year by the middle of next year. One Wall Street analyst we spoke with thinks Amazon Prime is really worth $400 a year (at least). I am curious on your hot take on this one – drop us a tweet at @juleshyman, @briansozzi and @yahoofinance. Stock stuff: Lots of interesting individual stock stories are on tap this week. Take for instance Restaurant Brands, which is holding a Tim Horton’s investor day on May 3. It’s not the norm for a company of Restaurant Brands’ size to hold an investor day for just one of its brands (others it owns include Burger King, Firehouse Subs and Popeyes). However, I think CEO Jose Cil doesn’t think Tim Horton’s turnaround is getting appreciated by investors, hence the showcase of the brand. I do think this could be a signal Restaurant Brands is open to spinning out the division in some form and reinvesting proceeds in faster growing concepts. It will also be interesting to see the market reception to Bausch & Lomb’s IPO on May 6. The company is nicely profitable, is a consumer staple (contact lenses which you need if you wear them…like I do) and has strong leadership. Anything other than a positive response, given these favorable investing characteristics, would be another major red flag on the broader market’s near-term direction. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz better bring his oratory A-game on the company’s May 3 earnings call. The stock has cratered 18% in the past month – basically encompassing his time back as CEO of the coffee giant. I would expect a challenging quarter from Starbucks, notably in its key market of China due to COVID-19 lockdowns. But the stock’s recent performance reflects more than challenges in the business – it reflects a view Schultz is another tone deaf, fat cat CEO who doesn’t understand the current real-world challenges facing his non-HQ workforce. Schultz has to do a better job here, his listening tours so far have been a social media nightmare for him. Yahoo Finance Trending Tickers to Watch: It’s a big morning for all things touched by Warren Buffett on the Trending Tickers page. Chevron seeing a lot of interest as Buffett upped his stake in the oil giant. Buffett disclosed a 9.5% arbitrage stake in Activision Blizzard, and its stock is seeing strong interest on our platform. Not much news on HP from the Buffett event, other than the fact he owns the stock and prefers printed documents because he doesn’t know how to email. Occidental Petroleum received more praise from Buffett, and finds itself on our list. Robinhood is on the trending ticker page not for anything good, but because Charlie Munger gave the trading platform a middle finger (again) at the shareholder’s meeting. China-based EV makers Nio and Xpeng — volatile names that are usually on the Trending Ticker pages — are back on this morning as traders assess sales updates from each. Nio said early Sunday it delivered 5,044 vehicles in April, down from 9,985 in March. “In late March and April 2022, the Company’s vehicle production and delivery have been impacted by the supply chain volatilities and other constraints caused by a new wave of the COVID-19 outbreaks in certain regions in China. The vehicle production has been recovering gradually,” Nio said. Watch for a negative reaction in Tesla shares off these sales updates.

5/3/2022,"There are plenty of reasons for caution in the markets right now. The big point is inflation, which is stubbornly high and continuing to rise. In response, the Federal Reserve has begun to raise interest rates and tighten up on monetary policy – but this raised the possibility of recession, a fear that just go a boost from the 1Q22 GDP numbers, which contracted at an annualized rate of 1.4% for the quarter. This is a dramatic change from the blistering near-7% growth reported in 4Q21, and back up fears that the combination of inflation and a Fed policy switch is starting to stifle economic activity. On top of all that, we’re also looking at renewed, and even harsher, lockdown policies in China, which bodes ill for that country’s manufacturing and export sectors – and slowdown in China’s exports will have a heavy impact on US consumption. And if all that weren’t enough, there’s the Russia-Ukraine war. The economic and trade sanctions imposed on Russia by the Western nations are still reverberating in the world’s financial sectors, impacting banks and commodity markets. In response, investors are making the obvious move: getting into defensive stocks. Equity strategist Michael Wilson, in a look at the markets from investment bank Morgan Stanley, writes of this defensive mindset: “With defensives the latest big outperformer, they are now expensive, leaving very few places to hide. This suggests the S&P 500 will finally catch up to the average stock and enter a bear market.” Wilson is not the only market watcher showing a serious interest in defensive stocks. Wall Street is clearly paying attention to them, and it’s no wonder why: some are showing yields of 8% or better, and even with interest rates rising, a dividend of that magnitude is a clear outperformer. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve picked out two of these high-yield dividend payers, which also boast Strong Buy consensus ratings from the Street. Let's take a closer look. TPG RE Finance Trust (TRTX) We’ll kick it off with TPG, a real estate investment trust (REIT) company. These companies are perennial dividend champions, in part due to tax regulations that require them to return a high percentage of profits directly to shareholders – and dividends are a logical vehicle for that return. TPG has a reliable dividend history going back to 2017; in that time, the company has not missed a quarterly payment, and has even added special dividends at times. Finishing last year, TPG was managing a $5.4 billion real estate asset portfolio; of that total, 71% was made up of commercial office space and multifamily dwelling units. The company’s business is focused on the Eastern and Western US markets, which together account for 63% of the portfolio’s geography. The company will report its 1Q22 financial results this Tuesday, May 3, but we can get a good feel for its current situation by looking back at the Q4 results. The company generated a bottom line, in GAAP terms, of 51 cents per diluted share, a sum more than adequate to support the dividend payment, set at 24 cents per common share with a 7-cent special dividend added on. The regular payment, annualizing to 96 cents per common share, gives a yield of 8.7%. 5-star analyst Donald Fandett, of Wells Fargo, is bullish on TPG and writes: “Proceeds from asset sales and other factors should drive some modest dividend upside going forward... TRTX should [also] benefit over time as rates rise, particularly as loans originated with high libor floors roll off or get repaid... TRTX shares trade at a discount to the peers who are north of 1xBV, a gap we expect to close over time. And the company has a new CEO... who was the Head of US commercial real estate debt at Goldman Sachs."" Overall, Fandett believes this is a stock worth holding on to. The analyst rates TRTX shares a Buy, and his $14 price target suggests a solid upside potential of ~33%. (To watch Fandett’s track record, click here) The recent analyst reviews on this stock break down 3 to 1 in favor of Buy over Hold, giving a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are priced at $10.57 and the $13.75 average target implies ~30% upside from the current level. (See TRTX stock forecast on TipRanks) PennyMac Mortgage (PMT) Next up is PennyMac Mortgage, another REIT, operating in the mortgage investment trust sub-sector of the business. Rather than making direct investments in real property, PennyMac invests in mortgage-backed securities and direct loans to buyers. While the real estate market was hot last year, PennyMac underperformed. In 4Q21, the last quarter reported, PennyMac showed investment income of $49.5 million, a top line that was down from $196 million in the year-ago quarter. The company registered a net loss of 28 cents per share in the quarter. Despite these lackluster results, PennyMac kept up its dividend. The most recent declaration, for 47 cents per common share, was paid on April 15. With an annualized rate of $1.88, the common share dividend gives a robust yield of 12%. With average dividends among S&P companies running at ~2%, and Treasury bonds still yielding less than 3% despite recent increases, the attraction of PennyMac’s dividend is clear. PennyMac stock is covered by BTIG analyst Eric Hagen, who notes the headwinds in the mortgage market and still comes down on an optimistic note. “Levered mortgage investors face the risk of earnings compression connected to aggressive Fed policy, but beneath the overhang, we can still identify select catalysts which are largely disconnected to the level and direction of interest rates and mortgage spreads... We want to remain long the common stock here. PMT also has preferred stock yielding [12]%, with lower spread risk and funding sensitivity as a result of sitting higher in the capital structure.” These comments back up Hagen’s Buy rating on PMT stock, and his $18.50 price target implies a one-year upside of ~20%. (To watch Hagen’s track record, click here) The rest of the Street supports Hagen’s thesis. There are 5 analyst reviews here, including 4 Buys and 1 Hold, giving the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating. PMT is selling for $15.37 and has an average price target of $18.80, for ~22% upside potential.

""That's a decision that the White House will make,"" Federal Student Aid (FSA) Chief Operating Officer Richard Cordray told Yahoo Finance in an exclusive interview this week (video above) when asks about student loan forgiveness, later reiterating ""it's up to the White House to make a judgement about that.

These include overhauling the troubled Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program for student loan borrowers in public service; erasing debt held by some students who were defrauded by a predatory for-profit college; discharging debt of totally and permanently disabled borrowers; and increasing scrutiny of student loan servicers. One estimate is that 700,000 borrowers have seen more than $17 billion wiped away through various actions. An estimated 37 million borrowers haven't had to make payments on their loans during the payment pause, and no new interest has accrued. The New York Fed recently found the payment pause has led to ""an estimated $195 billion worth of waived payments through April 2022."" During a press conference on Thursday, President Biden said he was considering ""some debt reduction"" but not up to $50,000, and that he would have an answer on forgiveness in the ""next couple of weeks."" Additionally, Biden is reportedly weighing income caps on who receives loan forgiveness. Cordray highlighted the ED's efforts to revamp Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), which is a key debt relief program for public servants, such as teachers, military servicemembers, and fire fighters. The program knocks off student loan debt for these borrowers if they make 120 qualifying monthly payments. Under previous administrations, the program has been a massive flop with few civil servants obtaining debt relief under cumbersome rules. ""For variety of reasons that program got — I'll use a technical term here — all screwed up over the years,"" Cordray said. ""And there were a lot of things that needed to be fixed. Congress tried to fix a few of them,"" but ""it was up to us at the department to bite the bullet and fix the remainder of them."" Last October, ED announced it was offering a time-limited waiver to borrowers working towards PSLF, on top of other reforms, to get more public servants debt relief. Under Biden's tenure, Cordray said, the number of public servants to receive forgiveness rose from about 7,000 to more than 220,000. ""We have made great strides with that program,"" Cordray said. Another program being overhauled is the borrower defense program. That program is an initiative to provide relief to students defrauded by predatory schools that sputtered during the Trump administration. On Thursday, ED announced it was canceling debt held by defrauded student loan borrowers who had attended a now-defunct beauty school, erasing $238 million. ""We now have a backlog that we're working through,"" Cordray said about borrower defense claims, adding that there will be more claims processed going forward because ""there were some schools and change the schools that cheated a lot of students."" Cordray, who served for six years as the first Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), added that ""we have a few other ways that we can provide [student] loan forgiveness very specific authority that Congress has granted us. We are working to do that as aggressively as we can. None of it is a substitute for general loan forgiveness. But again, that’s a decision for the White House to make."" — Aarthi is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. She can be reached at aarthi@yahoofinance.com. Follow her on Twitter @aarthiswami.

5/3/2022,"Berkshire Hathaway recently bought billions of dollars worth of Chevron and Occidental Petroleum shares, but Goldman Sachs thinks another oil major is a better buy than both. The investment bank reiterated a buy rating on Exxon and lifted their price target to $104 from $103. ""Overall, we are positive on the capital allocation strategy, leverage to a significantly improved refining backdrop, and outlook for production growth from key projects,"" Goldman analyst Neil Mehta wrote. Mehta's call on Exxon — which sits alongside a neutral rating on Buffett's Chevron — reflects potential several catalysts. Goldman Sachs sees $125 a barrel oil by the summer amid tightening supplies in part caused by the Russia/Ukraine war. Exxon, meanwhile, announced a new $30 billion stock buyback plan amid earnings last week that Goldman thinks should help support the stock price. ""While the quarter was mixed, the stock still outperformed the XLE and the S&P 500 on Friday,"" Mehta noted, ""contributing to our view that the stock could be a relative out-performer in a less constructive market backdrop."" As for Chevron, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported over the weekend it holds roughly $25.9 billion in Chevron's stock. Chevron marks Berkshire's fourth largest stock investment as Buffett bets on a future of higher oil prices. ""I think it's going be very precious stuff over the next 200 years,"" Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger said at Saturday's meeting. Goldman's Mehta listed a few reasons why Chevron is a less attractive investment than Exxon. ""We emerge from 1Q22 results with our Neutral view on Chevron intact,"" Mehta stated. ""As we have previously discussed, while we maintain a bullish view on energy equities and recognize that the U.S. majors are an important part of the energy benchmark, we continue to see more compelling value at buy-rated Exxon with 26% total return vs neutral-rated Chevron with 6% total return. We also highlight we see less leverage to the more constructive refining setup given Chevron's reduced relative Downstream exposure vs Exxon, with Chevron global refining capacity of 1.8 million barrels per day vs Exxon of 4.6 million barrels per day. In addition to Chevron's reduced relative refining exposure, we view the company’s upstream project queue as less advantaged vs buy-rated peer Exxon's, with Exxon offering attractive growth opportunities such as Guyana, as well as LNG projects including Golden Pass and Coral FLNG in the near term.""
