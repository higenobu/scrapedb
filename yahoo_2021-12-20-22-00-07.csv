12/20/2021,"Sarah Palin on Sunday said she would never get the COVID-19 vaccine. She said: ""I will not [get one]. I won't do it and they better not touch my kids either."" She claimed she had natural immunity because she had tested positive for COVID-19 in March. Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin has vowed not to get a coronavirus vaccine after claiming she had natural immunity because she contracted COVID-19 in March. Palin, who was the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, said on Sunday she would get the vaccine ""over my dead body."" She also attacked Dr. Antony Fauci, the White House chief medical advisor, for being ""inconsistent"" in his advice about vaccines and immunity. ""Do you remember [Fauci] said that if you had covid, you would be naturally immune?"" Palin said Sunday during an interview at an event hosted by conservative group Turning Point USA in Phoenix, Arizona in comments reported by the Daily Mail. ""So at the time we were led to believe we wouldn't need to have the shot. ""Well, then they changed their tune. Those of us who have had COVID, they're telling us that even though we've had it — we have natural immunity — now that we still have to get a shot."" Medical advice has in fact been consistent that people who caught COVID-19 previously should still get vaccinated. Reinfections have been noted for more than a year, and in March 2021 Insider's Marianne Guenot reported that those 65 and over are especially at risk. Early data suggests that reinfection is significantly more likely from the fast-spreading Omicron variant. Nonetheless, Plain concluded that: ""It'll be over my dead body that I get a shot."" ""I will not. I won't do it and they better not touch my kids either."" Sarah Palin announced in spring that she and two of her children had tested positive for COVID-19 and urged Americans to wear masks and take the pandemic seriously. Dr. Fauci said in September that people who had previously tested positive for COVID-19 could conceivably be ""protected"" from reinfection but warned the protection may fade. President Joe Biden last week warned that Americans who were unvaccinated faced a ""winter of severe death and illness,"" particularly as the new Omicron variant spreads rapidly across the US. ""But there's good news: If you're vaccinated and you have your booster shot, you're protected from severe illness and death,"" Biden said on Thursday, per CNN. Biden reportedly plans to issue a ""stark warning"" on Tuesday to unvaccinated people about the risks of not receiving a shot.

12/20/2021,"On CBS's 60 Minutes, Sunday, correspondent Bill Whitaker took a deep dive into the lack of sewage treatment affecting residents of Lowndes County, Alabama. According to Whitaker, Lowndes County is one of the most neglected corners of the country and the poverty rate is double the national average, which makes sanitary sewage disposal financially unattainable for the county's residents. ""I have seen things like this in Haiti, and parts of Southeast Asia. I have never seen anything like this in the United States,"" said a shocked Whitaker in one resident's backyard. Environmental health researcher and White House advisor Catherine Coleman Flowers has been battling this longstanding, and overlooked, public health failure in Lowndes County for 20 years. It is what she calls ""America's dirty secret."" ""If this was a community of more affluent people, this would've made headlines 20 years ago when I first started doing the work,"" said Flowers. She added, ""The reason that the situation has continued for so long is because of the type of benign neglect that has happened to Black communities, poor communities, and rural communities across the United States."" Whitaker shared that the state of Alabama could not identify how many homes had this problem, so Flowers went door-to-door to find out. After surveying 3,000 homes, Flowers found that two-thirds had failing systems or no systems at all. Even worse, the unsanitary conditions have even had an effect on the residents' health, according to a tropical disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine, Dr. Rojelio Mejia, who tested the stool and soil from residents' properties. ""Using a PCR test, like those used to detect Covid-19, they found small amounts of DNA from hookworms, a parasite that can cause stomach problems, anemia and developmental delays in children,"" Whitaker reported of Mejia's team's findings. ""Our study in Alabama was a small study, about 55 patients, and the results were, we found over 30% of people in at-risk situations with poor sanitation had hookworm,"" said Mejia, who was surprised by their results. ""We were very shocked, and we actually had to run the sample several times to prove to ourselves that we found these numbers."" So why has nothing been done? Lowndes County officials have claimed they don't have the money, and the governor and the head of the State Department of Public Health declined to speak with 60 Minutes. However, according to Sherry Bradley at the State Department of Public Health, they're not responsible. Nevertheless, she has taken it upon herself to start a pilot project on her own. ""I have begged money from a whole lot of people,"" admitted Bradley, who also said she does not know why the state hasn't stepped in to solve the problem. In the end, Whitaker concluded, ""Last month, just days after we spoke with Bradley, the DOJ launched an unprecedented civil rights investigation into whether the Alabama Department of Public Health is discriminating against Black residents in Lowndes, denying them access to proper sanitation."" However, Whitaker also shared, ""The department says it's cooperating. We couldn't find a single state program devoted to remedying the sewage problem in rural areas."" 60 Minutes airs Sundays at 7 p.m. on CBS.

12/20/2021,"GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger said the January 6 select committee is looking into if Trump acted criminally. ""Nobody is above the law,"" Kinzinger told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday. Kinzinger also told ABC's ""This Week"" that the committee would subpoena Trump if necessary. GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger said the House select committee investigating the events of January 6 is looking into whether or not former President Donald Trump committed a crime related to the Capitol riot. In an interview with CNN on Sunday, host Jake Tapper asked the Illinois representative if he believes Trump committed a crime and if that's something the committee is ""explicitly investigating."" Kinzinger said he could not yet say whether he believed Trump had committed a crime but thinks it's something they will know by the end of the investigation. ""Nobody is above the law. And if the president knowingly allowed what happened on January 6 to happen, and in fact was giddy about it, and that violates a criminal statute, he needs to be held accountable for that,"" Kinzinger, one of two Republicans on the committee, said. The congressman said it was too early to say if Trump acted criminally but that he has ""a lot of questions about what the President was up to."" Kinzinger said the committee is looking into ""every bit of detail"" around what happened that day, but that he thinks it's more important to look at what allowed the insurrection to happen in the first place. ""What I think is almost more important is what led up to January 6? What is the rot in the democracy that allowed the 6th to happen? And have we corrected from that since?"" Kinzinger said. In an interview with ABC's ""This Week,"" Kinzinger also said the committee could subpoena sitting members of Congress if necessary, as well as Trump. ""Obviously, when you subpoena the former president, that comes with a whole kind of circus environment,"" Kinzinger told anchor Jonathan Karl. ""But if we need him, we'll do it.""
