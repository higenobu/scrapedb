3/21/2022,"Morad Tahbaz, the British-Iranian man who was not allowed to leave Iran as part of the deal struck by the British and Iranian governments freeing Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori, has gone on hunger strike in protest, his family have said. Tahbaz has also been taken from the public ward in Evin prison in Tehran, but it is not known where to, or for what reason, the family said. The family accused the Foreign Office of sacrificing him in order to secure the release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori, and revealed that Morad’s 93-year-old mother was taken to hospital on Saturday. His sister Taraneh Tahbaz said: “He was released for 10 hours, then 24 hours, before it ended after 48 hours. I am afraid the Foreign Office wanted him out of the way for 48 hours so they could secure their wonderful photo op.” The Foreign Office declined to offer any comment, but on Friday said it had been assured Tahbaz was being taken back to prison from his family home solely to fit him with an ankle tag before he was put back on furlough. The Foreign Office insisted that as part of the deal freeing the other two dual hostages, British diplomacy had secured his release on indefinite furlough. Any other outcome would be a breach of undertakings given to the Foreign Office. Tahbaz’s failure to reappear at his family home this weekend after being taken back to prison on Friday, and the news that he has gone on hunger strike in protest at the handling of his case, suggests he feels events are moving in the wrong direction. He has British, Iranian, and American citizenship, and it appears Iran did not see him as part of the deal. It is also possible that behind-the-scenes diplomacy is working to restore his release. Morad’s sister said there had been no contact from the Foreign Office since Friday. “His condition is dire and he is in prison. This whole furlough business was a farce. We are left deflated, and worrying that this is all now going to be swept under the carpet.” She had briefly seen video pictures of her brother on an iPhone, and said: “he was barely recognisable, since he has lost 40kg. I only knew it was him when he waved and smiled.” Tahbaz, a conservationist, was arrested in January 2018 along with eight other members of the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation. Taraneh said: “We were advised by the Foreign Office the less noise we made the better it would be for him and his release, so for four years we were told he would be part of the deal if and when it were to be made. It was only after Anoosheh and Nazanin were to be released – about which we are ecstatic – that we found out he was to be left behind. We are very grateful that Nazanin is still lobbying for us now that she is out.” She also disclosed her 93-year-old mother, Hamideh, had to be taken to hospital on Saturday night because “she had a complete meltdown. Morad’s incarceration has been a terrible blow to her. She really wants to stay alive just to see him. “It was such a shock when he was first arrested. We thought it was a mistake, but when they were given terrible prison sentences, we did not know what to do.” Separately, Ashoori’s wife, Sherry Izadi, thanked Guardian readers for raising money to pay for a sudden £27,000 fine imposed on them by the Iranian government as part of his release. The family had to go heavily into debt to raise the money. Within 12 hours of launching a crowdfunding website publicised by the Guardian, the money was raised. Izadi said: “We are absolutely overwhelmed by the public’s generosity and the hundreds of messages of support and sympathy we have received, These acts of kindness have restored our faith in humanity. We are also hugely grateful to the Guardian who helped us raise this cash in such a short period of time. “We mark the first day of spring and the start of the Iranian new year with renewed hope and a firm resolve to help reunite the remaining detainees with their loved ones.” The Foreign Office was contacted for comment.",News/World news,British-Iranian Morad Tahbaz on hunger strike after being kept in Iran,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/british-iranian-morad-tahbaz-hunger-strike-iran-evin-nazanin
3/21/2022,"A small Australian theatre company made up of neurodiverse and disabled actors has won one of the world’s richest theatre prizes, the DK2.5m (AU$384,000) Ibsen award. Back to Back, which was established in 1987 and is based in Geelong, were announced as the winners of the biennial prize on Sunday night in Norway. The pioneering theatre company is the first Australian recipient of the award, dubbed “the Nobel prize for theatre”, which goes to an individual or company “that has brought new artistic dimensions to the world of drama or theatre”. Back to Back is renown for their acclaimed and often confronting shows, like 2011’s Ganesh Versus the Third Reich, which sees the cast members interrupt the show to question their right to perform it, about the Hindu deity travelling to Germany to reclaim the swastika from the Nazis. Their other shows include Food Court (2008), Lady Eats Apple (2016) and The Shadow Whose Prey the Hunter Becomes (2019). The current Back to Back ensemble are actors Mark Deans, Scott Price, Breanna Deleo, Simon Laherty and Sarah Mainwaring. The latter told the Guardian she was “so excited” about their win. “I think we all are, it is such an honour for all of us to get that award and to receive it from that panel,” Mainwaring said. “And for them to see that in us is so fantastic and it’s so rewarding for us to know that we can go on, and build our work The Shadow Whose Prey the Hunter Becomes, to tour it to more places. And make it bigger, hopefully, a finer work. It is such a privilege.” Back to Back’s artistic director Bruce Gladwin told the Guardian he was “shocked” by the news. When he was first contacted by the Norwegian National Theatre, which takes part in the announcement, he thought they wanted to collaborate. “But in that meeting, they announced that we’d won it. None of the ensemble had any idea that they were in contention for it, let alone that they’d won. They were just so moved that their work was acknowledged at that level.” “Awards are strange because you don’t necessarily make the work to receive them. This just came out of the blue. I feel really honoured that this group of international theatre practitioners have been watching the company’s work for close to two decades. They’ve acknowledged the ensemble’s insight as social commentators, which is embedded within the work. I feel quite touched about their understanding of what we’re trying to do. It’s a pat on the back for everyone.” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Norway’s ministry of culture made the announcement on Sunday local time, timed to mark the birthday of celebrated Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. “We are proud to be able to honour an outstanding and unique theatre company that asks questions of their audience, of society and of each other through groundbreaking productions,” said chair of the prize committee, Ingrid Lorentzen. “Back to Back’s work is exciting, unsettling and thought-provoking. It inspires us to be better artists and better people.” In a letter detailing its decision, the prize panel praised Back to Back’s shows as “some of the most memorable productions of 21st century theatre”. “There is no need for exposition in their theatre, no overreliance on dialogue, no need for a proximity of performer and role. Back to Back create a theatre that doesn’t follow the rules; they take over spaces that have been marginalised, erased or rendered insignificant … this is a theatre that defies a tick box culture. It’s a theatre – both pragmatic and metaphysical – that gravitates around what it means to live in the fullest sense of the word at this precise moment in history.” Gladwin said they had no concrete plans for the money: “We’ve just got over the shock of actually winning the award. But it is an opportunity to take some risks, to support some blue sky projects. Back to Back will receive their award, which has previously gone to British playwright Peter Brook and Nobel winner Peter Handke, at a ceremony in Oslo in September.",Arts/Stage,Geelong ensemble win one of the world’s richest theatre prizes,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/21/geelong-ensemble-win-one-of-the-worlds-richest-theatre-prizes
3/21/2022,"Antonio Conte will see this victory as progress: weary but persistent opponents held at arm’s length, successive league wins for the first time since early December and enough vigour in attack to suggest that Tottenham have no intention of letting Arsenal out of their sights any time soon. The chase for that coveted fourth spot is on and Spurs will feel that they are building momentum at the right time. They are only three points below Arsenal, albeit having played a game more, and most importantly there is a sense of the pieces starting to fall into place under Conte, who can reflect not only on the devastating combinations between Harry Kane and Son Heung-min but also how his side managed the game in the second half, their rugged defending ensuring that a West Ham equaliser rarely felt likely. In truth a tired West Ham could have few complaints about Spurs going above them. David Moyes’s starting approach was too passive and his side never looked capable of containing Kane, who forced Kurt Zouma’s own goal and made both of Son’s strikes. It has not been easy to read Spurs under Conte. They have lurched between extremes on too many occasions in recent months and the whole project has felt fragile at times, almost as if we are only ever one nonsensical defeat away from Conte deciding enough is enough and quitting on the spot. Yet there have been signs of promise. Take the recent clobbering of Everton, who were picked apart with devastating ease. There was a sense of something falling into place at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium that night and there was a similar feeling by the 24th minute of this London derby, with Spurs in complete control and West Ham starting to fear the worst after falling two goals behind without offering much in the way of resistance. No doubt it helped that West Ham were feeling the effects of going to extra time during their Europa League victory over Sevilla. They started the game in cautious fashion, Moyes changing his system to match Conte’s 3-4-3, but that soon caused problems. Spurs were hunting for lethargy and the plan worked after only nine minutes, the opening goal arriving when Matt Doherty picked his moment to lead a coordinated press and hound Arthur Masuaku off the ball when the wing-back dithered on the left. It was poor from Masuaku, starting for the first time since Boxing Day, but it was fine work from Doherty. The right wing-back swiftly moved the ball to Kane and the striker drove down the right before drilling a low cross towards Son, whose presence was enough to force Kurt Zouma to slide in and divert the ball past Lukasz Fabianski. It should have been 2-0 two minutes later. This time Dejan Kulusevski caused problems, dribbling through on the right and cutting the ball back to Son, who shot wide of the empty net. Son did not have to wait long to redeem himself. His goal was a classic: made by Kane dropping deep, peeling away from Declan Rice and spraying a gorgeous diagonal pass behind Zouma, who could not stop Son from letting fly with a vicious left-footed shot that flew past Fabianski before he had time to react. Still, though, Spurs were not entirely secure. They were fortunate not to be pegged back after 10 minutes, an errant pass from Kane allowing Michail Antonio to nip round Eric Dier and drill wide from a tight angle, and West Ham would gain a foothold before the break. Aaron Cresswell’s corner was inviting, Craig Dawson headed it on and the unmarked Saïd Benrahma displayed wonderful technique by spanking an awkward volley inside Hugo Lloris’s near post. Now it was game on and there was no decrease in the entertainment after the break. Spurs remained a threat on the break and they almost regained their two-goal lead after 51 minutes, Son the provider this time, Kane just unable to squeeze his shot past Fabianski. With the tension rising, there was speedy action from the stewards to stop pitch invaders from chaining themselves to the goal at both ends. Moments later West Ham should have equalised, Antonio sidefooting over when Cresswell’s cross reached him. It was an exhausted Antonio’s final contribution of note, Moyes sending Andriy Yarmolenko on to see if the Ukrainian could repeat his heroics against Sevilla, Pablo Fornals also replacing Masuaku as West Ham tried to give themselves more options in attack. Yet Spurs were no longer in a giving mood. There was a flicker from Yarmolenko but West Ham did not create much. The better chances continued to go to Spurs and they defended well late on, Cristian Romero a rock at the back, Rodrigo Bentancur and Pierre-Emile Højbjerg scrapping tigerishly with Tomas Soucek and Rice in midfield. Urged on by Conte, Spurs eventually made the points safe. Lloris punted the ball forward, Kane beat Dawson and Zouma in the air and Son ran through to finish coolly. Spurs were safe at last.",Sport/Football,Kane and Son Heung-min combine to earn Spurs vital win over West Ham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/20/tottenham-west-ham-premier-league-match-report
3/21/2022,"Saudi Arabia’s state oil company said it would increase spending on oil production to meet rising global demand, as it reported a doubling of profits in 2021. Saudi Aramco – the world’s largest oil exporter and one of the world’s most profitable companies – said its net profit increased by 124% to $110bn (£83bn) in 2021, compared with $49bn a year earlier. The company said its profits had soared as a result of higher crude oil prices as demand for oil rebounded after the pandemic, and also because of increased margins in its refining and chemicals business. Brent crude oil rocketed to $139 a barrel, a 14-year high, earlier this month, but has since dropped to closer to $100. In early December, a barrel of crude was priced below $70. Aramco expects demand for oil to keep climbing, and said “substantial new investment” is required to meet this demand, in a move likely to dismay climate campaigners. It said it is increasing its capital expenditure for 2022 by about half to between $40 and $50bn, with further growth expected until the middle of the decade. The state-owned oil firm’s capital expenditure came in just below $32bn in 2021, an 18% increase on 2020. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been asked in recent days by western governments to pump more oil to end their reliance on supplies from Russia. The Gulf countries are the only two leading oil producers that have immediate spare capacity able to offset the shortfall in Russian-produced energy. However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in a recent report that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are so far “showing no willingness to tap into reserves”. The countries are both members of the Opec+ cartel of oil-producing countries, which will meet for the next time at the end of March to decide on output levels. Despite the conflict in Ukraine, Opec members only agreed earlier this month to raise output by a modest 400,000 barrels a day. Labour has accused the UK government of “going cap in hand from dictator to dictator” as it attempts to address the energy crisis. Aramco’s president and chief executive, Amin Nasser, said the outlook for oil demand remained uncertain “due to various macro-economic and geopolitical factors”. He added that the company’s investment plan “aims to tap into rising long-term demand for reliable, affordable and ever more secure and sustainable energy. “We recognise that energy security is paramount for billions of people around the world, which is why we continue to make progress on increasing our crude oil production capacity, executing our gas expansion programme.” Aramco is just the latest of the world’s big oil companies to post soaring profits. In the UK, the swelling coffers at BP and Shell have prompted Labour to call on the chancellor Rishi Sunak to announce a windfall tax on oil and gas profits, an idea that he has so far resisted. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, renewed her calls on Sunday for the introduction of the tax to tackle the growing cost of the living crisis in the UK. “If we used that windfall tax on the big profits being made by North Sea oil and gas companies… to redirect it into keeping prices low, you would tackle the cost of living crisis and you would not need to have such big increases in pay,” she told the BBC. Aramco briefly became the most valuable listed company in history when it floated on the Saudi stock exchange in 2019 and was named the world’s most profitable business. However, it was later toppled by US tech company Apple.The state-owned company said it would pay shareholders a dividend of nearly $19bn for the final quarter of 2021, while it also plans to distribute $4bn in retained earnings to investors. This takes its total dividend for 2021 to $75bn, not including bonus shares.",News/Business,Saudi Aramco to increase oil production to meet global demand,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/20/saudi-aramco-to-increase-oil-production-to-meet-global-demand
3/21/2022,"Labour has accused Boris Johnson of “appeasing Tory MPs to save his own skin” by dropping a plan to place an earnings or time limit on backbenchers’ jobs outside parliament. The party has identified eight Conservatives who were particularly critical of the prime minister over claims of lockdown-breaking parties inside Downing Street, but who earn significant extra salaries. Johnson and his ministers pledged to take action over outside earnings following a wave of bad publicity over second jobs, including the scandal over illicit lobbying by now-resigned Tory backbencher Owen Paterson. The extent of some outside work was also highlighted by a furore over Geoffrey Cox being paid nearly £6m as a lawyer since joining parliament, including in the British Virgin Islands, and voting by proxy on days he was undertaking paid work. Ministers suggested limiting either earnings or numbers of hours, with one, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, suggesting that around 10 to 15 hours a week would be reasonable. But the government’s submission to the consultation by the Commons standards committee, seen by the Guardian, states that a time limit “would be impractical”, while an earnings cap “could serve to prohibit activities which do not bring undue influence to bear on the political system”, such as writing books. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said her party would toughen up the system. “Boris Johnson’s hollow promise to clamp down on MPs’ second jobs was nothing more than a media stunt to dodge scrutiny – he is straight back to appeasing Tory MPs to save his own skin,” she said. “The prime minister’s U-turn shows just how far he’s willing to go to put his party’s own interests ahead of the public. The public deserves a government that respects them – not one that treats the job of an MP as just another income.” The Tory MPs highlighted by Labour as examples of those who have been critical of Johnson over the claims about parties, for which he still faces a police investigation, are Theresa May, Jeremy Wright, Andrew Mitchell, Stephen Hammond, David Davis, Tim Loughton, Bob Neill and Gary Streeter. In a particularly scathing Commons question at the end of January, May challenged Johnson, her successor as prime minister, over a report by the senior civil servant Sue Gray into the claimed parties. “Either my right honourable friend had not read the rules or didn’t understand what they meant, and others around him, or they didn’t think the rules applied to No 10. Which was it?” May asked. Since leaving Downing Street, May has earned sums of up to £160,000 a time for speeches, with her personal company also paying her a fixed income of £85,000 a year for speeches. Hammond, the Wimbledon MP and a former minister, has three extra jobs that collectively pay almost £100,000 a year, including as an adviser to an investment firm and non-executive director of a life sciences company.",News/Politics,Labour condemns PM’s decision not to place limits on MPs’ second jobs,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/20/labour-slams-pms-decision-not-to-place-limits-on-mps-second-jobs
3/21/2022,"Maybe this is exactly what Welsh rugby needed. Until Ange Capuozzo produced one of the most scintillating runs in Six Nations history to set up a 79th-minute try for Edoardo Padovani, Wales were winning a game they deserved to lose. In front of their fans in Cardiff, and celebrating personal milestones of Alun Wyn Jones and Dan Biggar, the team were sloppy, unimaginative and disjointed. But they were winning. Wayne Pivac would no doubt have lamented his side’s performance but would have taken solace in the result. Good teams win ugly, or so the adage goes. And though few who have watched Wales stutter across the tournament would argue that they are a good side, a win would have been enough to place them level on points with England and Scotland. Then Capuozzo unleashed hell from distance, Padovani dotted down under the posts and Paolo Garbisi coolly converted the extras to consign Wales to a first home defeat by Italy. So rather than ugly wins, Pivac spoke of former glories. “I think everyone was pretty happy with the Six Nations last year and the way we were heading,” the coach said, referencing Wales’s title-winning campaign in 2021. But therein lies the problem. That triumph, commendable though it was, merely disguised a damaging fault line running through the professional game that now looks wide enough to swallow Pivac whole. “They’re entitled to their view,” he said when asked to respond to a growing list of critics calling for him to be sacked. “On the basis of the competition we had last year with the squad and what we did over the last three weeks, building depth and having creditable performances against quality opposition, Italy is a backward step. “It’s probably the lowest point in most of the players’ careers in terms of pulling on the Welsh jersey and the pride they have in doing that. Losing a home game against Italy was not in the script, so it’s very disappointing. It is fine margins, but we have to stay strong and believe in what we are doing. This group does that, and we believe in the players we have.” It would be unfair to lay the blame solely at Pivac’s door. The Welsh regions are in turmoil. Not one Welsh club are in the top half of the United Rugby Championship with Ospreys the best-placed team ninth in a league of 16. This past weekend Scarlets received a 57-12 drubbing at the hands of the Bulls in Pretoria and Cardiff lost 40-3 to the Stormers in Cape Town. The Dragons have not won since last October. Compounding matters is the sorry state of the under-20 team. A day after Italy claimed their first Six Nations win in seven years, their junior counterparts beat Wales 27-20 in Colwyn Bay. That meant that Wales finished fifth for the third time in six years in this all-important feeder competition and have been surpassed by an impressive Italian youth programme. With such a dearth of ready-made talent coming through, and with struggling clubs unable to foster a winning mentality, Pivac has had little choice but to keep faith with an ageing group. Despite missing 626 Tests’ worth of experience at the start of the tournament, Pivac named 10 players older than 30 in his original squad. Perhaps more worrying is that Pivac has yet to name an unchanged team. With 18 months until the World Cup kicks off in France, the Welsh Rugby Union must make a swift decision. Does it stick with Pivac and place its trust in a coach who has at least procured silverware between two abject years? Or dooes it cut ties and look to overhaul before it really is too late? Rassie Erasmus needed only 18 months to turn South Africa from underachievers to world champions. Whether Wales could attract someone of his calibre is a separate debate. Wales head south in July to take on the No 1-ranked Springboks. Both teams have achieved success through similar approaches. The 2019 World Cup semi-final between them was 80 minutes of attritional, slogging, sapping rugby. One might have called it ugly. But winning ugly games is what good teams do. Over these past six weeks, Wales have shown that they’re anything but.",Sport/Sport,Wales must use shock Italy loss as much-needed wake-up call | Daniel Gallan,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/20/wales-must-use-shock-italy-loss-as-much-needed-wake-up-call
3/21/2022,"My friend Marcus Reichert, who has died aged 73, was an American painter and neo-noir film director who spent much of his life in Britain. Marcus’s paintings reflected a darkly sophisticated vision. He painted a crucifixion series that was described by Richard Harries, when he was bishop of Oxford, as among the most disturbing painted in the 20th century, and the American critic Donald Kuspit wrote that Picasso’s and Bacon’s crucifixion paintings paled in comparison. Later works featured large vessels – vases and urns – filled with flowers and vines in a vivid and distinctive palette. Most recently he had explored the infinity symbol in a series of new paintings. In film Marcus’s best known work was Union City (1980), starring Debbie Harry, which he wrote and directed, about a man who becomes so obsessed with someone stealing his milk bottles that it leads to grisly consequences. Just before Marcus’s death he had completed the principal photography for a new film – a second collaboration with Harry. Every effort is being made to ensure it will be completed and will reflect his vision of the elegant and the enigmatic. Union City, and some of Marcus’s other, mostly short, film works are in the archive of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Wings of Ash: A Dramatization of the Life of Antonin Artaud (1978), featuring Mick Jagger, is one of the film, poetry and prose works held in the Marcus Reichert Archive at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France in Paris. Marcus was also a poet, and the author of several novels, including The Miracle of Fontana’s Monkey (1997), Hoboken (2009) and the semi-autobiographical The Memoirs of Jerome Berger (2019). Born in Bay Shore in New York state, Max was the son of Beatrice (nee Tiley), a teacher, and Rex Reichert, who ran his own advertising agency. After attending Collegeville-Trappe high school in Pennsylvania, he went to the Rhode Island School of Design, where he met Sally MacLeod, a fellow student, later a writer and photographer. They married in 1970. Marcus primarily earned his living through the sale of his paintings and his writing. But he also excelled at rehabilitating old houses and, given his fine eye for elegance and style, was able to make a profit when he resold them. He and Sally had many friends in Britain and felt a profound connection with the UK. In the early 1980s they moved initially to Islington, north London, and then to Hexham, in Northumberland, where Marcus continued to paint and write. For a short time they tried living back in the US, but they returned to the UK in the early 2000s and bought a beautiful old house in Ramsgate, Kent. In 2006, after selling up in Ramsgate, they moved to St Hippolyte-du-Fort, northwest of Nîmes in southern France. A discerning and demanding character, Marcus had a talent for storytelling – both visual and verbal – and a charming yet often wicked wit. He is survived by Sally and his sister, Melissa.",Arts/Art and design,Marcus Reichert obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/20/marcus-reichert-obituary
