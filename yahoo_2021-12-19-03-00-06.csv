12/19/2021,"Former U.S. trade adviser and staunch Donald Trump supporter Peter Navarro revealed his knowledge this week of what appeared to be a significant plot to overthrow a legitimate presidential election. In an appearance on former White House strategist Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast Thursday, Navarro praised Bannon as a “hero” for coming up with the “strategy to go up to Capitol Hill” on Jan. 6. Bannon had told his “War Room” listeners on Jan. 5: “So many people said, ‘Man, if I was in a revolution, I would be in Washington.’ Well, this is your time in history .... we’re on the point of attack tomorrow ... it’s game day.” Navarro, using a football analogy about one team sacking another, gloated Thursday that there were “100 people working on the ... team ... who were going to make sure we remanded the [electoral] results back to the battleground states,” which would have subverted Americans’ choice for president. Peter Navarro to Bannon: “You were the hero on J6, Steve. You were the guy who had the .. strategy to go up to Capitol Hill. Pence was the quarterback. We had 100 people working on the .. team who were going to make sure we remanded the results back to the battleground states.” pic.twitter.com/Sg6KKXvKP9 — Ron Filipkowski (@RonFilipkowski) December 16, 2021 Navarro also referred to former Vice President Mike Pence as the “quarterback” of the offense, suggesting they had wanted Pence to go along with the plot. Recent details uncovered by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection appear to confirm Navarro’s characterization of the forces that had been building to undermine the vote. Thousands of pages of emails and texts released by former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows have revealed, among many other things, a PowerPoint “coup plot” that was cooked up by Trump allies in a “command center” at the Willard Hotel leading up to Jan. 6. Under the plan, Trump was to declare a national emergency, baselessly citing foreign “control” of electronic voting systems. Right-wing attorney John Eastman penned a pair of “coup memos” on how to overturn the election by challenging electoral votes — and met with Meadows and Trump in the Oval Office to discuss the strategy the day before the insurrection, The New York Times reported. A top aide for the former vice president said Eastman pressured Pence to “betray his oath” of office and the Constitution in a bid to convince him to baselessly challenge the electoral votes. Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa wrote in their book “Peril” that Bannon told Trump that Jan. 6 was the day to bring down the Biden presidency. “We are going to kill it in the crib, kill the Biden presidency in the crib,” Bannon said, according to the book. “If Republicans could cast enough of a shadow on Biden’s victory on Jan. 6, Bannon said, it would be hard for Biden to govern. Millions of Americans would consider him illegitimate. They would ignore him,” the book said. Both Bannon and Navarro have been subpoenaed by the House select committee to testify. Trump urged Navarro in a statement to ignore the summons, keep mum and “protect executive privilege” in the investigation by the “Communist Democrats.” Bannon also refused to testify, and was indicted last month on two counts of criminal contempt of Congress.

12/19/2021,"By Julie Steenhuysen CHICAGO (Reuters) - As the Omicron variant gains momentum in Europe and the United States, scientists are rewriting their expectations for the COVID-19 pandemic next year. Just weeks ago, disease experts were predicting that countries would begin to emerge from the pandemic in 2022 after enduring a series of surges driven by the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants. First among them would be populations with a significant amount of exposure to the coronavirus, through a combination of infections and vaccination. In those places, COVID was expected to ease into an endemic disease, hopefully with less-severe periodic or seasonal outbreaks. Vaccines, available for much of 2021 only in wealthy nations, could reach the majority of the global population by the end of the year ahead. But the rapid spread of the highly-mutated Omicron variant, identified in late November, and its apparent ability to reinfect people at a higher rate than its predecessors, is undermining that hope. Already, countries are reverting to measures used earlier in the pandemic: restricting travel, reimposing mask requirements, advising against large gatherings for the winter holidays. While it is not quite back to square one, much more of the world will need to be vaccinated or exposed to COVID to get past the worst of the pandemic, disease experts told Reuters. ""People are sick of the pandemic and God knows I am, but unless we can get some urgency to compel our leaders to take action, I really see 2022 being a lot of more of the same that we saw in 2021,"" said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. Even after COVID becomes a more endemic disease, new variants will spawn outbreaks and seasonal surges for years to come. ""There's always going to be a baseline number of COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""A lot of people haven't come to terms with that."" The hope is that the virus diminishes to the point where it is no longer disruptive. But living with COVID-19 does not mean the virus is no longer a threat. Instead, people will need to be ready to adjust when the next variant comes along, said Dr. Tom Frieden, chief executive of Resolve to Save Lives, a global public health initiative, and former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""You need to recognize that at certain times, it's going to be safer to do things than at other times."" PANDEMIC PHASE ENDING IN 2022? Some scientists are not entirely ready to abandon hope that some parts of the world will emerge from the pandemic next year. More than 270 million people have been infected with COVID, according to the World Health Organization, while an estimated 57% of the global population has received at least one vaccine dose, representing potential protection that did not exist two years ago. ""Even if that immunity is not as good against Omicron, it doesn't mean that it's worthless. And that immunity is more effective against serious illness than it is against getting infected at all,"" said Dr. David Dowdy, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins. So far, most of the studies looking at the effectiveness of vaccines against Omicron have focused on neutralizing antibodies, which latch on to the virus and prevent it from entering and infecting cells. Blood test results from fully vaccinated people show Omicron has learned to escape neutralization; a booster dose might restore that protection. Immune system T cells, which destroy infected cells, also appear still to be able to recognize the variant. Many experts believe this second line of defense will prevent hospitalizations and deaths. ""You still have a lot of people who are susceptible"" because they are not yet vaccinated, said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at New York University. She said that was among the reasons she believes it will be some time before the world moves from pandemic to endemic COVID-19. In the meantime, living with COVID in 2022 will likely mean assessing local risks and protecting oneself through vaccination, masking and social distancing. ""When I go to the store this afternoon, what helps me is to know how much COVID is in my community,"" said Dr. Robert Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine at University of California, San Francisco. ""There will not be one state of the pandemic. There will be different states for different people and for different regions,"" he said. ""And that's going to be the way it is for the foreseeable future.""

12/19/2021,"Saving for retirement is hard when you’ve got so many bills to pay today. And the bills just keep getting bigger. You're probably already using every trick you can find to stretch your budget. Well, here's one you might not know: The government is so keen to see Americans save for retirement that it's willing to pay you to do it. Here’s how you could score up to $2,000 in free money through an underused tax break called the saver’s credit. The saver’s credit — formerly called the retirement savings contributions credit — is a tax credit that can be claimed by middle- and lower-income taxpayers who contributed to a retirement account during the tax year. The credit is worth up to $1,000 for individuals and a maximum $2,000 for a married couple filing jointly. If this is the first you’re hearing about the saver’s credit, well, that’s common. A survey from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies found only 38% of U.S. workers were aware of the tax break. In fact, the saver’s credit is so underused that lawmakers have specifically asked the Treasury Department to get the word out. To be eligible, you must be at least 18 years old, cannot be a full-time student and cannot be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return. Next, you must contribute to a retirement plan, which can be a 401(k) or other employer-sponsored plan, or a traditional or Roth IRA. And, your earnings must not top the credit’s income thresholds. You can take the saver’s credit if your adjusted gross income falls below these limits: $66,000 for a married couple filing jointly for 2021, $68,000 for 2022. $49,500 for a head of household filing for 2021, $51,000 for 2022. $33,000 for all other taxpayers (including individuals) filing for 2021, $34,000 for 2022. Not eligible? A financial adviser can help you find other ways to get more from your retirement savings. The dollar value of the saver’s credit is calculated based on your income, your tax filing status and the amount you contribute to an eligible retirement account during a tax year. You may be eligible to claim 50%, 20% or 10% of the first $2,000 you put in if you’re an individual, or $4,000 if you’re a married couple who files a joint return. If you want to use the credit when you file your 2021 tax return, check the list below to see how much you can get: You can take the 50% credit if your adjusted gross income is $39,500 or less. You can take the 20% credit if your adjusted gross income is between $39,501 and $43,000. You can take the 10% credit if your adjusted gross income is between $43,001 and $66,000. You get no credit if your adjusted gross income is over $66,000. You can take the 50% credit if your adjusted gross income is $29,625 or less. You can take the 20% credit if your adjusted gross income is between $29,626 and $32,250. You can take the 10% credit if your adjusted gross income is between $32,251 and $49,500. You get no credit if your adjusted gross income is over $49,500. You can take the 50% credit if your adjusted gross income is $19,750 or less. You can take the 20% credit if your adjusted gross income is between $19,751 and $21,500. You can take the 10% credit if your adjusted gross income is between $21,501 and $33,000. You get no credit if your adjusted gross income is over $33,000. The saver’s credit math isn’t too difficult. For example, let’s say you’re a married couple filing jointly, you earned $38,000 last year, and contributed $1,000 to an eligible account. The value of your credit would be 50% of your $1,000 in contributions — or $500. If you put in $5,000, only the first $4,000 would count, and your credit would reach the cap of $2,000. Keep in mind, a credit is way better than a tax deduction. A deduction just reduces the amount of your income that’s subject to taxes, but a credit actually cuts your tax bill dollar for dollar. So yes, it’s free money — so long as you can afford to save for retirement in the first place. If your budget is tight, try downloading an app that invests using just your ""spare change."" The IRS gives you several tax-advantaged options for saving for retirement — and taking advantage of the saver’s credit. In addition to a 401(k), you can contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, a SIMPLE IRA, 403(b) plan (for certain employees of public schools and tax-exempt organizations) or through the Thrift Savings Plan, which is open to federal employees and members of the uniformed services. If you don't have an IRA, it's easy to open one through a number of investing apps. The IRS also extends the saver’s credit to Americans with ABLE accounts, which are savings plans for people with disabilities. The cutoff for many tax breaks is the end of the calendar year. For example, any donations to charity that you write off on your 2021 return must have been made during 2021. Makes sense, right? But you can make retirement contributions right up to the April tax deadline that count toward the saver’s credit for that tax year. To claim the saver’s credit, you must complete IRS form 8880 and include it with your tax return. You’ll need two key pieces of information to fill out Form 8880: your adjusted gross income you calculated on your income tax return, and documents that show your retirement contributions for the year. Does the thought of yet another tax form make your head spin? Don't worry, claiming your saver’s credit is a snap with the help of good tax software that will guide you through step-by-step.

12/19/2021,"(Reuters) - Myanmar's ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi appeared in court on Friday wearing a white top and a brown wraparound longyi that is the typical uniform for prisoners in the Southeast Asian country, a source with knowledge of the court proceedings said. Nobel laureate Suu Kyi, 76, was sentenced this month to four years in jail for incitement and breaching coronavirus regulations by a court. Her sentence was later reduced to a two-year term of detention in her current, undisclosed location. It was the first time Suu Kyi, who is known for wearing elegant traditional outfits sometimes with a flower in her hair, has been seen in a prison uniform in court and it was unclear if it signalled a broader change in how she and other senior officials on trial were being treated. Myanmar has been in turmoil since the coup against Suu Kyi's democratically elected government led to widespread protests and raised international concern about the end of tentative political reforms following decades of military rule. The verdicts were the first out of nearly a dozen cases against Suu Kyi that carry combined maximum sentences of more than 100 years in prison. Suu Kyi denies all charges. A former mayor of the capital, Naypyitaw, Myo Aung, who is also on trial, was also seen in court in a prison uniform on Friday, said the source who asked not to be identified. The wraparound sarong, known as a longyi, are traditional outfits worn by both men and woman in Myanmar. In remarks published on Tuesday, military ruler Min Aung Hlaing said in state media that Suu Kyi and ousted President Win Myint would remain in the same location during their trials and would not be sent to prison. Suu Kyi, the daughter of the hero of Myanmar's independence, spent years under house arrest for her opposition to military rule but was freed in 2010 and led her National League for Democracy party to a landslide victory in a 2015 election before being arrested after the Feb. 1 military coup. Her trial in Naypyitaw has been closed to the media and Suu Kyi's lawyers have been barred from communicating with the media and public.
