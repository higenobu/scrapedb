12/31/2021,"In the battle with Covid, the year 2021 has turned out to be a reality check. Misleading claims at the start of the pandemic in 2020 that lockdowns would suffice to “send coronavirus packing” were replaced, at the start of the year, by another simplistic conceit that vaccinations would accomplish the same goal, enabling economic activity and social life to resume at full power. It has not turned out that way. An evolving and sometimes stop-start combination of national restrictions, individual behaviours and repeat vaccinations has kept the worst ravages under some control. Yet the spike in Omicron cases and this week’s preparation for new hospitalisations show that the crisis is very finely balanced. As we bid farewell to the old year on Friday, it ought to be clear to all but the most dogmatic ideologues that 2022 will not be a shining new virus-free era. It will be another volatile mixture, not quite the same as 2021, but not so very different either.  Boris Johnson always shies away from this truth. He dislikes giving bad news even when he is popular, and especially when he is not, as at present. He pretends that simple solutions are just around the corner, even when, as now, he can no longer count on his own party’s support to implement them. That is why he has bet the farm on simply getting through the Christmas and new year season with a combination of modest and potentially contradictory policies but without bringing the NHS to its knees. He tells the public to party on, but at the same time to take regular tests; to act responsibly, but to splash the cash in bars; to observe private rules, but to spurn public ones. The essence of his policy is to cross his fingers and hope something turns up. It is desperately cynical. Mr Johnson does all this because he has lost his authority over Conservative MPs and the country. Lockdown and social distancing options are now closed off to him by the right wing of the Tory party. The vaccines route may soon become almost as prohibitive, because his party will oppose the necessary measures to incentivise the unvaccinated minority to comply. The reality is that Mr Johnson is more than ever reliant on the decency of others. If England comes through the holiday period infection spike, it will be thanks to the public, not to the prime minister. Just as he did earlier on in the pandemic, Mr Johnson has launched his latest policy with another airy promise that he knows he cannot keep. In times gone by he promised a world-beating contact tracing system by June 2020; it never happened. A month ago, to combat Omicron, he committed to a million booster jabs a day by this weekend; the target has never been met. Before the holidays, he said that people should take a test and socialise; all too often, those tests are simply unavailable. He is taking a tremendous risk. Mr Johnson is not alone in trying to balance public health caution with respect for the public’s frustrations and fatigue. Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland, Mark Drakeford in Wales and Paul Givan in Northern Ireland are navigating these same issues. None have got everything right, and although the temptation to inflate small differences for political advantage is ever present – as Emmanuel Macron is also showing – most of the UK national governments are in approximately the same place on Covid because their publics are too. As 2022 dawns, the reality that we all remain in this together should guide them all.",Opinion/Opinion,"The Guardian view on Covid in 2022: new year, old pandemic | Editorial",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/30/the-guardian-view-on-covid-in-2022-new-year-old-pandemic
12/31/2021,"By the end of this year, the United Nations warned recently, 377,000 Yemenis will have died from seven devastating years of war – in many cases killed by indirect causes such as hunger; in others, by airstrikes or missile bombardments. Seventy per cent of the fatalities are thought to be children under five. As 2021 began, there were hopes that Joe Biden’s arrival in the White House might bring progress towards peace. His administration quickly announced it was ending all support for offensive operations by Saudi Arabia, which spearheaded the US- and UK-backed coalition fighting for the internationally recognised government overthrown by Houthi rebels. It also revoked the Trump administration’s designation of the Houthis as a terrorist group. But Mr Biden’s team overestimated its ability to help resolve the crisis. The diplomatic push soon faltered. In October, Washington announced a $500m military contract with Riyadh which includes support for its attack helicopters, used in operations in Yemen.  Meanwhile, a humanitarian catastrophe that the UN has described as the worst in the world is deepening. Just before Christmas, the World Food Programme said that it had been forced to cut aid due to insufficient funds, three months after it warned that 16 million Yemenis were “marching towards starvation”. Four million people are displaced. This was the poorest country in the region even before the war broke out, with 47% of the population living in poverty. The UN has since warned that it is on course to become the poorest in the world, with 71%-78% of Yemenis now below the poverty line. Already inadequate infrastructure and services have been devastated, with schools and hospitals targeted. Both sides have shown a ruthless contempt for civilians. The UN special envoy Hans Grundberg warns that the recent escalation is among the worst in the conflict. The Iran-backed Houthis have intensified their offensive on Marib, the last major stronghold of the government that they ousted, stalling talks. Coalition airstrikes on the airport at the capital Sana’a, held by the Houthis, halted aid flights this month, although rebels now say they can resume on a “temporary” basis. The war has become increasingly complex as the secessionist Southern Transition Council along with al-Qaida and Islamic State cells have seized their opportunity. But above all, it has been supercharged by the regional rivalry between Riyadh and Tehran. As one young Yemeni observed: “We are just a battlefield.” Saudi Arabia, which expected a quick win, has little to show for the billions that it has poured into this war. Though its ally, the UAE, withdrew most troops two years ago, Riyadh is still in search of an exit. That it is talking to Iran, after they cut ties in 2016, is a significant advance. But the two sides have very different reasons for engaging, and the lives of Yemenis are low in either’s priorities – many suspect that the Houthis hope to derail the talks, believing that a military victory is within their grasp. They have sharply increased missile and drone attacks on Saudi targets. With borders and airspace sealed, the world has largely been able to ignore the war’s impact on Yemen’s civilians. But the conflict must not be allowed to slip down the agenda again. Its grim and entrenched nature is not cause to give up on diplomacy, but all the more reason to renew the determined efforts required if Yemenis are to have a real future.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Yemen: the forgotten war | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/30/the-guardian-view-on-yemen-the-forgotten-war
12/31/2021,"Germany’s health minister has said he is in favour of modifying quarantine rules to cope with a new wave of coronavirus caused by the Omicron variant, which is already dominant in some parts of the country. Anyone infected with Omicron is required to quarantine for 14 days, and the same applies to their contacts, even if triple vaccinated. Some experts have suggested reducing the quarantine length to five days for people who show no symptoms and return a negative test result. England and Spain have shortened their quarantine times from 10 to seven days, and the US to five.  Omicron accounted for about 17,000 out of Germany’s almost 43,000 new confirmed cases on Thursday. The health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said the real infection rate was likely to be around two to three times higher owing to under-reporting and a lack of laboratory testing during the Christmas period, and he expected the confirmed daily figures to double within four or five days. There are fears that if many thousands of people are infected, the health system and other essential services such as policing, firefighting, schools and rubbish collection could grind to a halt. Contingency plans are in place under which the army and the technical emergency agency, the THW, would take over vital infrastructure roles. Since entering office this month Lauterbach has frequently acknowledged taking steers from experts in the UK owing to the more advanced spread of Omicron there. He said the German government’s expert council – a group including virologists, psychologists and sociologists – was working on a plan to adjust the length of quarantine required. The Omicron surge is strongest in the north of the country, in particular areas such as Bremen, Hamburg, Schleswig Holstein and North Rhine Westphalia. The Netherlands and Denmark are also experiencing high Omicron rates. With schools in Germany due to return on 3 January after the Christmas break, there have been calls for the holidays to be extended. Education ministers have called a meeting for 5 January, and the government and leaders of the 16 states are due to hold their next decision-making round on protection measures two days later. Experts have suggested decisions on school openings should be based on regional infection rates so as to cause the least disruption possible. The eastern state of Thuringia, where infections are among the highest in the country, has said school holidays will initially be extended for two days. Karin Prien, the head of the conference of education ministers, said the aim should be to keep schools open owing to the psychological and social burdens of home schooling. “The schools should be the last area to have to once again face blanket closure,” she said. Just over 71% of people in Germany are fully vaccinated, while 17.5 million people – not including the 4 million under-fives – are without any protection. A booster campaign has so far reached 38% of the population.",News/World news,Germany may follow England in cutting isolation time as Omicron spreads,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/germany-may-follow-england-in-cutting-isolation-time-as-omicron-spreads
12/31/2021,"A 12-year-old girl who vanished from her home in Devon 10 days ago has been found safe and well almost 300 miles away in Boston, Lincolnshire. Leona Peach, from Newton Abbot in south Devon, was last seen wearing flip-flops and a fur coat. Police were working on the theory that she might have travelled to north Devon where she has family connections.  But she was found at an address in Boston, and a 34-year-old man originally from Devon has been arrested on suspicion of child abduction and kidnap. A Devon and Cornwall police spokesperson said on Thursday: “Following an extensive policing operation, 12-year-old Leona Peach who was reported missing from Newton Abbot on the morning of Monday 20 December has been located safe and well. “Aided by officers from Lincolnshire police and with support from Devon child services and Lincolnshire child services, units attended and undertook a search of an address near Boston this afternoon and located Leona. She will continue to be supported by specialist officers and child services. “During the search police have arrested a 34-year-old man, originally from Devon, on suspicion of child abduction and kidnap. He is due to be transferred into police custody within Devon and Cornwall for questioning in due course. Officers would like to thank the public for their support.” The police made several appeals for information about Leona and called on her to get in touch if she could. Officers became increasingly alarmed after she missed Christmas with her family, and her relatives were being supported by specialist officers.

12/31/2021,"Ghislaine Maxwell is going to jail, and for a very long time indeed. Prince Andrew’s good friend of many decades, and Donald Trump’s regular guest at his Florida retreat, has been convicted of grooming and trafficking girls for sex in a verdict that will reverberate through the highest reaches of the transatlantic establishment. No more invites to Balmoral for the woman who turned vulnerable teenagers into rich men’s sexual playthings, and no more hobnobbing with friendly newspaper editors either. No more private jets or haughty instructions to staff to keep their mouths shut, even as they were picking up discarded vibrators from the bedroom floor. And presumably no more public sympathy of the kind Rachel Johnson expressed recently in the Spectator, fondly recalling Ghislaine’s “naughty eyes” as she flirted with a young Boris Johnson at Oxford, back in the days when none of them had ever heard of the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. For all that Maxwell’s lawyers sought to paint her accusers as gold-diggers chasing damages from Epstein’s estate, the lesson many will draw from this case is that the rich are far more often protected by their money and connections than rendered vulnerable by them. Well, now the world can finally see the seedy billionaire and his predatory girlfriend for what they were. Much like the guilty verdict handed to Harvey Weinstein almost two years ago, the result goes some way to restoring faith in the battered principle that nobody should be above the law. Yet there’s something profoundly unsatisfying about it nonetheless. That the woman who procured girls for Epstein and his wealthy friends will now die in prison, while the men involved remain either free to live their lives or (in Epstein’s case) beyond the reach of any mortal judge, provokes a nagging sense of unfinished business.  It goes without saying that Ghislaine Maxwell is not the victim here. Although her lawyers made much of the fact that Epstein’s prison suicide left her to carry the can for his crimes, suggesting rage at him had been unfairly projected on to her, the prosecution argued more convincingly that she was in fact critical to the enterprise. A lone middle-aged man asking teenage girls to visit his ranch is creepy, but the same invitation from a couple feels respectable, even benevolent. From an early age, we drum into children the idea that if they’re lost or scared they should seek help from a police officer first and, failing that, a woman. The girls Maxwell lured into her boyfriend’s clutches were reassured by an older woman’s presence and it’s the betrayal of that female trust that feels so monstrous. While these vulnerable teenagers looked to her for support, she was grooming them for sexual exploitation, normalising the perverted anything-goes culture inside his mansion. Strip away the yachts and the servants and all the other trappings of a billionaire lifestyle, and there is frighteningly little separating Maxwell from that tiny but grotesque pantheon of female offenders seemingly so desperate to be loved that they collude in their partners’ abusive fantasies, even to the point of helping persuade someone else’s daughter into a car. We may never know whether Maxwell got her own kicks from this twisted game or whether she was simply too damaged to resist it, conditioned perhaps as friends have suggested by a childhood in the shadow of her bullying father, the late tycoon Robert Maxwell. But the “poor little rich girl” thesis sits uneasily with some of the stories her accusers told in court, which imply a woman accustomed to dealing with problems as only the rich can: by paying someone to make them go away. Kate, who was 17 when she first met the couple, recalled Maxwell complaining about Epstein’s voracious sexual appetite and asking “if I knew anybody who could come and give Jeffrey a blowjob because it was a lot for her to do”, much as she might seek recommendations for a butler or a pool boy – except in this case it was imperative they be young. Carolyn, who was 14 when she was first paid to give Epstein one of his infamously sexualised massages, described how Maxwell felt her breasts and bottom much as if she were checking over livestock for sale, and concluded she had a “great body for Mr Epstein and his friends”. And it’s on those nameless “friends” that the spotlight must now fall. First and most obviously in the firing line are the men against whom direct allegations have been made, chief among them Prince Andrew. Virginia Giuffre, who is currently attempting to bring a civil suit against the prince accusing him of a sexual assault he has vehemently and repeatedly denied, can only be encouraged by a verdict she welcomed with a pointed tweet, arguing that “Maxwell did not act alone. Others must be held accountable.” Whether her lawsuit succeeds or fails, however, the unmasking of his good friend Ghislaine as a convicted sex trafficker makes it almost impossible to envisage a way back to royal ribbon-cutting duties for the prince. But there are plenty more high-profile men who flew on Epstein’s planes, enjoyed his lavish parties, even stayed overnight in one of those mansions hung with tacky erotic art, and say they saw nothing amiss. Was he simply so discreet that nobody could possibly have suspected a thing? Or could it be that a predilection for teenage girls simply didn’t seem all that shocking, inside a rich man’s world where trading in an ageing first wife for someone barely older than your daughter is no big deal? Meanwhile, in the US, there are disturbing questions to answer about a long, oddly flat-footed investigation into Epstein that left victims fearing they would never get their day in court and conspiracy theorists emerging to fill a judicial vacuum. That Maxwell held her tongue even when she eventually came to trial, refusing to testify in her own defence in a way that meant she could be asked no incriminating questions about the household names peppering the victims’ testimony, has only encouraged the latter. Some still hope she might share whatever she knows now, given the conviction has left her with nothing much to lose. The family’s decision to appeal makes that unlikely at least in the near future, and it remains to be seen whether a woman who has traded on her connections all her life is capable even now of turning on them. But she cannot be the only one who knows more than she is telling about that tainted circle through which so many powerful men have moved. Justice is surely neither done, nor seen to be done, until all their dirty little secrets are out.

12/31/2021,"Your report on the state of the NHS (One in four Britons ‘not confident NHS can care for them’, survey reveals, 26 December) was summed up by the quote from Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary: “With record waiting lists, 100,000 NHS staff shortages and 112,000 vacancies in social care in 2019, the Tories left our health service criminally ill-equipped for Covid.” My husband, in the final stages of dementia and awaiting a place in care, is in a holding ward. Insufficient nurses try to cope, but mouth hygiene is neglected. And no shower or hair wash for more than a month. He deserves better. Hardly God’s waiting room, more like death row. Aneurin Bevan will be turning in his grave.Hilda ReynoldsBristol   You report that one in four of us is not sure that the NHS can care for them. I wonder if this stage in public sentiment was envisaged or even engineered as part of a transition to a system of private healthcare. For almost two years we have been bludgeoned with the command to protect the NHS. But protecting the NHS is not primarily our responsibility – it’s the government’s. There’s nothing inevitable about the NHS having to struggle along on inadequate resources while its staff compensate for the deficit with heroic amounts of goodwill.Susan TomesEdinburgh  In the past four months, three friends of mine, all ardent believers in the NHS, have swallowed their principles and paid for private operations to avoid a wait of up to two years for surgery that would restore their quality of life. They have no doubts about the quality of care provided by the NHS, but its underresourcing means that long waits for non-urgent interventions have become painfully inevitable. With a heavy heart, I fear that I would do the same in their position. This is what 11 years of underfunding has come to.

12/31/2021,"Simon Hattenstone’s article (I didn’t want anyone else to look after Mum – until I realised what she wanted, 27 December) almost exactly mirrors my mother’s story. Aged 94, frail but still living independently in a small cottage in London, she fell in late November and spent much of one night on the floor, in pain and disorientated. Hospital followed for one week at St George’s, Tooting. There she received the most amazing care with the doctors, nurses and auxiliary staff all meeting my expectations of the amazing NHS at its very best, even during these trying times. But it was evident that she couldn’t return to her house alone. Luck struck. A close friend had recently died and her carer was available to move in with my mother. Outcome? An elderly woman who seems more contented and at ease than previously, perhaps because the worry of living alone at a great age has now been taken away. She has support, friendship and the most amazing care, and she’s still “at home” – that being her greatest desire of all.  But here’s the bit that Hattenstone’s article doesn’t address: money. In my mother’s case, and I’m assuming in Hattenstone’s too, there is sufficient family income to cover the costs of a live-in carer. For most this simply wouldn’t be an option. Until a system is devised, and funded, that would offer all people dignity and independence in old age, we can’t rest easy. It’s so good that Hattenstone’s mother and my mother are now thankfully content and well cared for, but that should, in a civilised society, be the lot of all older people. It clearly isn’t now.Jol MiskinSheffield  Simon Hattenstone’s article was an excellent sharp focus on the importance of listening to those in need of care. A good carer can give independence, reassurance, dignity and friendship, and even the most of complicated of houses can be adapted if someone wants to stay in their own home. We put raised floors throughout the downstairs of Mum’s cottage, suspended over all manner of steps and uneven floors, so that a wheelchair could move smoothly everywhere.

12/31/2021,"Dominic Raab has been pictured without a mask at a football match earlier this week, despite the club urging fans to keep their face covering on while seated in the stadium. A spokesperson for the deputy prime minister and foreign secretary said he “followed the rules at all times”, given government guidance is that masks only need to be worn indoors at sport stadiums.  However, the government has urged people to exercise extreme caution in the run-up to New Year’s Eve, with the Omicron variant fuelling a surge in cases to historically high levels since the pandemic began. There were 183,037 new infections reported across the UK on Wednesday, when Raab travelled to Stamford Bridge to watch Chelsea’s draw with Brighton and Hove Albion. The home club issued “important information” for fans attending the game, telling them: “Supporters will be required to wear masks in all indoor areas of the stadium, including the concourses, except when they are eating or drinking. Masks are not required when seated or walking outside the stadium, but they are recommended.” A supporter near Raab took a photo of the un-masked cabinet minister in a black jacket, next to another fan who did appear to be wearing a face covering, though others in the background could be seen without one. An observer, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: “Personally I find it quite surprising that a senior minister would think it wise to sit in a tightly crowded public arena and ignore health recommendations to wear a mask for 90 minutes during this Omicron surge. “For me it’s his decision-making which should be called into question. It’s a busy football game, he can be easily spotted and Covid cases are high. He’s not really bothered about setting the best example.” A spokesperson for Raab said: “He followed the rules at all times.” Ministers have advised people to be extra careful during the festive period given people are mingling more with elderly relatives. The rules remain that people only need to get a Covid test for certain reasons, but health officials have gone further in light of Omicron’s spread and a reluctance by minister to implement any tougher restrictions than plan B. Some government advisers have suggested people should adapt their behaviour further than the rules – for example by de-prioritising socialising or getting tested before they meet up with friends. Ministers have been accused before of failing to set an example, after Boris Johnson was pictured not wearing a mask during part of a visit to a hospital in Northumbria last month. At the time, Raab defended the prime minister. He told Sky News: “Like many of us, we take the advice and guidance that we’ve got in different settings and that’s the right thing for us to do as politicians and it’s the right thing for the public to do.”",News/Politics,Dominic Raab photographed at Chelsea game without a mask,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/30/dominic-raab-photographed-at-chelsea-game-without-a-mask

12/31/2021,"Now that the British former socialite Ghislaine Maxwell has been convicted in her sex-trafficking trial, speculation is growing that she may try to cut a deal and become a government witness in any broader investigation into the elite social circle of her ex-boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein.  Maxwell would be aiming for a reduced sentence by naming powerful names when it comes to others who may be involved in Epstein’s crimes. But defense lawyers and sexual-crimes prosecutors have cast doubt on the government’s appetite to strike a bargain. They question whether Maxwell has any vital information the government does not already have, and whether it represents a strategy Maxwell has previously attempted that has failed. “It all depends on who is she would be cooperating against, and what she has to offer,” said Jeffrey Lichtman, the defense attorney who represented the Mexican drug trafficker Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán at trial two years ago. “I would not be surprised if she had already tried to cooperate and it had failed.” Maxwell, who is expected to appeal her conviction, was found guilty on five of six charges for her involvement in Epstein’s sexual abuse of teenage girls. Prosecutors said Maxwell “preyed on vulnerable young girls, manipulated them and served them up to be sexually abused”. She is expected to receive a significant prison term. According to Lichtman, there are defendants who, in the eyes of the government, are so bad that it does not want to strike a deal in exchange for testimony. “They don’t want to take the hand of someone involved a criminal operation and let them cooperate against people who are well below them.” “That may be the case here – they just feel that she’s so bad they won’t allow her to cooperate,” Lichtman said. But that does not preclude Maxwell and her lawyers from making an offer. “There’s a tremendous amount of information she has on some very important people. Now that she’s been convicted she may be more eager to discuss. She certainly should, in my mind, because a lot of people skated here, while she bore the brunt of the government’s full wrath,” Lichtman said. Former federal and state prosecutor Elie Honig said on Twitter: “Maxwell’s cooperation is not particularly likely, but it is possible. You’d need (1) Maxwell to be willing and fully on board, (2) SDNY to be fully convinced of her truthfulness, and (3) a realistic plan to use her information versus others.” One obstacle to any state prosecution based on Maxwell’s cooperation would be the statute of limitations on criminal and civil sexual crime complaints. The civil case bought by Virginia Giuffre against Britain’s Prince Andrew only exists because of a briefly opened window under the New York Child Victims Act, which allowed accusers to sue beyond the statute of limitations. But there is also pressure for high-profile visitors to Epstein’s properties in New York, Palm Beach and the the US Virgin Islands to be held accountable for any potential crimes, particularly as the government’s case against Maxwell appeared to avoid reference to broader aspects of the conspiracy. “Of all the people supposedly involved with Epstein, 99% of them never made it into the government’s evidence,” said Lichtman. “Perhaps they were trying to avoid any frolic by the jury – that they’d get distracted by the bold-face names – but many people didn’t get prosecuted here when it seems like they could have,” he added. According to Wendy Murphy, a former federal sex crimes prosecutor who now teaches at Boston Law, the relative absence of Epstein from Maxwell’s conspiracy trial was part of the government’s strategy. “They didn’t need more to prove conspiracy,” she said. “They didn’t need to overdo it. There was some weakness in the victims testimony but it was more than offset by other evidence.” The next chapter of the Epstein case, Murphy said, is likely to come through the civil action against Prince Andrew. “Prince Andrew may be the next shoe to drop, and it may be the only shoe,” she said. The windows have closed on lawsuits for the most part, and I don’t know of another lawsuit with the potential to expose information.” But if more investigations do happen, Murphy said Maxwell could get time off her sentence if the government wants important information she has. “I’m not sure the feds are asking and I’m not sure she’s willing to give. She’s probably not going to say anything, and they don’t need her to, because they already have a lot of information. If they don’t need anything, they’re not going to give her a discount.” Ultimately, said Bennett Gershman, professor of law at Pace University in New York, much depends on whether the government feels there is political mileage in continuing the investigation and identifying high-profile people who may have been part of the scheme. “It’s hard to say what the government is interested in further on. We can’t answer that. Are the victims and people who really care about this case satisfied now Maxwell has been convicted or do they want to see other people in the larger network investigated?” He added: “They have limited resources and personnel, so does this case cry out for further investigation and prosecution? That’s a political decision by the US department of justice and the US attorney’s office.”",News/US news,Speculation grows that Maxwell may try to cut a deal for reduced sentence,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/ghislaine-maxwell-sentence-deal-speculation-jeffrey-epstein

12/31/2021,"A coroner will investigate the deaths of two women from herpes following childbirth, amid fears they contracted the virus from their surgeon. Kim Sampson, 29, and Samantha Mulcahy, 32, died weeks apart after their babies were delivered by caesarean section at different hospitals in Kent.  Their families have campaigned for answers as to whether they contracted the infection from their surgeon, after a BBC investigation found the women were treated by the same person. The inquests have been listed to open and adjourn in Maidstone on 4 January, with a pre-inquest review the following month and full inquests at a later date. Sampson’s mother, Yvette, said: “We’ve wanted this since Kim died in 2018 – it’s been a long time coming. We hope we are finally going to get answers to the questions we’ve always had – both for ourselves and for Kim’s children.” Herpes infections are commonly found in the genitals and on the face, often with mild symptoms. Sampson’s baby boy, her second child, was delivered at Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital in Margate in May 2018, but she died at the end of the month in hospital in London after becoming infected. In July the same year, first-time mother Mulcahy died from an infection caused by the virus at William Harvey hospital in Ashford. Dr Rebecca Martin, chief medical officer for East Kent hospitals, said: “Our deepest sympathies are with the families and friends of Kimberley and Samantha. “We will do everything possible to support these inquests and our thoughts are with Kimberley and Samantha’s families at this time.” A coroner had previously ruled out inquests into their deaths but now this decision has been reversed. The families had initially received a letter from coroner Katrina Hepburn saying there would not be an inquest for either case, acknowledging the similarities but saying there was “no connection”. Sampson had a good pregnancy but struggled with the birth and she kept saying the baby was stuck, her mother said. Doctors performed a C-section to deliver her son and Sampson needed a blood transfusion after injuries sustained in the operation. She was rushed back to hospital following discharge after the operation as doctors believed she had bacterial sepsis. She was given antibiotics, but her condition worsened. Mulcahy went into labour four weeks ahead of her due date. Her hospital was part of the same trust as that where Sampson was treated. She had 17 hours of contractions and was taken for a C-section after some worrying blood test results. After giving birth, Mulcahy was kept in for observation. She became increasingly unwell, and doctors also thought she had bacterial sepsis. She spent four days in intensive care, where a doctor suggested antiviral medication, but the microbiology department advised them to continue with antibiotics. Mulcahy died from multi-organ failure following a “disseminated herpes simplex type 1 infection”, a postmortem found. Both women had a “primary infection” which means that this was the first time they had contracted the virus and neither of their children were found to have it. Sampson’s family requested documents from Public Health England which revealed emails from the trust, some NHS bodies, staff at PHE, and a private lab. The messages showed that the same two clinicians – a midwife and the surgeon who carried out the C-sections – had been involved in both births.",News/Global development,Inquests to be held into deaths of new mothers who died from herpes,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/30/inquests-to-be-held-into-deaths-of-new-mothers-who-died-from-herpes
12/31/2021,"Hospitality bosses have urged consumers not to desert their local pub during “dry January”, the month when many people abstain from alcohol, as hard-hit venues struggle to recover from a nightmare Christmas. Takings over the crucial festive weeks have fallen by as much as 60% compared with the same period in 2019, making this the second year in a row that pubs, bars and restaurants have lost out during the most lucrative time of the year.  The slump means venues have not built up the cash reserves they need to survive the typically quiet January and February, piling pressure on a sector already reeling from pandemic-related losses and ballooning rent debts. Several leading figures in the hospitality industry told the Guardian that pubs would fall into even greater financial difficulty unless people kept visitingthem during January, the annual month when some people choose to stop drinking. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of the trade body UK Hospitality, said: “I think we could definitely dispense with it [dry January].” She called on people who are trying to avoid alcohol to consider choosing something else at the bar or going out for food. “This year, there are an awful lot more non-alcoholic options available that are really good quality, so there’s no excuse not to go out and support your local hospitality business.” Greg Mulholland, the Campaign for Pubs director, said: “Pubs and publicans will need support throughout January and we’d urge people to continue to go to the pub. “The pub is about so much more than having a drink, so we hope people recognise the important role pubs play in our communities and get out and support them, whatever they choose to drink and eat.” He also stressed the improved availability of non-alcoholic options in the UK’s network of pubs, the number of which has been in decline in recent years and currently stands at about 47,000. Concern about alcohol intake has increased during the pandemic, following a Public Health England report that detailed a rise in problem-drinking deaths associated with successive lockdowns. However, the report found that the steepest rise in alcohol sales came from people drinking at home during lockdowns that forced hospitality venues to close. Paul Crossman, who runs three pubs in York including The Swan, said it was still possible for people to order at the bar without compromising their health goals. “It would be much appreciated if people did forego dry January, but loads of us have really good alcohol-free options too. It’s about supporting local hospitality businesses so that they can get through it,” he said. The pub group Fuller’s was forced to close several venues earlier this month as a result of slow trade, partly because its portfolio of more than 380 pubs and inns is weighted towards London, where cases of the Omicron Covid variant have soared and work-from-home guidance has left parts of the city deserted. The chief executive of Fuller’s, Simon Emeny, said he hoped there would be “enormous pent-up demand” after people sacrificed pre-Christmas nights out to ensure they could still see family. He pointed out that while the aims of dry January, promoted by Alcohol Change UK, are laudable, there is conflicting opinion about whether it’s the right approach to counteracting overindulgence. “Medical evidence says that drinking in moderation is more sensible than abstaining for an entire month,” Emeny said. “I do think that having been denied the opportunity to mix and socialise, a lot of people will say they’ll make up for lost time and be more sociable in January.” While many pubs fear a downturn in January partly due to people choosing not to drink Peter Marks, who runs the UK’s largest bar and nightclub business Rekom UK, said young people were less likely to abstain. “They’ll take a couple of weekends for their wallet to recover from Christmas and New Year, but as long as students come back in that third week of January, we never see any effect from dry January,” he said.",News/Business,"Keep going to pubs during dry January, UK hospitality bosses urge",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/30/pubs-dry-january-uk-hospitality-alcohol-christmas
12/31/2021,"The health secretary, Sajid Javid, is being urged to ensure NHS workers are prioritised for Covid tests, or risk a “devastating” impact on patient care, after conceding to MPs that the supply of lateral flow kits would have to be “constrained” over the next fortnight in light of rocketing demand. The British Medical Association (BMA), which represents doctors, warned that the system for ensuring NHS staff receive tests was “not working”.  It said its members were reporting problems with obtaining PCR and lateral flow tests, despite healthcare workers supposedly being given priority for both. The BMA’s chair of council, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said: “Being unable to get the tests means staff may not be legally allowed to work and, at a time of acute workforce shortages and winter pressures, this could be devastating for the care that can be given right across the NHS.” Demand for tests has been surging in recent days, with new infections increasing rapidly, and ministers, including the prime minister, Boris Johnson, advising the public to test themselves before attending New Year’s Eve parties or meeting vulnerable relatives. Another factor boosting demand is that the self-isolation period in England was recently cut from 10 days to seven – but only after taking two negative lateral flow tests. Javid has acknowledged in a letter to MPs that the supply of lateral flow tests may have to be “constrained” over the next fortnight. “In light of the huge demand for LFDs seen over the last three weeks, we expect to need to constrain the system at certain points over the next two weeks to manage supply over the course of each day, with new tranches of supply released regularly throughout each day,” he wrote on Wednesday night. The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, has written to Javid, calling on him to make sure healthcare workers are given priority. “I urge you to put the key workers we have relied upon for the past two years to the front of the queue and do everything you can to prevent a staffing shortage crisis in our NHS. The government must get a grip on this crisis, bring these shortages to an end, and ensure everyone can access tests quickly and regularly,” he wrote. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson rejected the idea healthcare workers had been unable to obtain tests, saying they had their own dedicated supply channel. Azeem Majeed, professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, said the government was “in part to blame” for the shortage of tests, because of its advice to the public to test themselves before social events and outings. “It has become very clear that there are nowhere nearly enough lateral flow tests for Covid-19 in England to allow the government’s policy of their indiscriminate use,” he said, in an article in the Guardian. He called for the publication of daily data on how many tests are available, and then “clear guidance from the government on whatgroups should be prioritised for testing and how frequently theyshould test”. The Welsh government announced on Thursday that it had lent an additional 4m lateral flow testing kits to England in order to alleviate the supply squeeze across the border, bringing the total offered to 10m. The National Education Union (NEU) has called for teachers to be among the groups given priority, amid concerns about whether sufficient tests will available as the new term starts next week. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “If schools are the top priority, as Boris Johnson has said they are, there is a case for teachers being a priority group so that they can test themselves, so they can be in school educating pupils.” With all secondary pupils expected to be tested before they start the spring term next week, the Liberal Democrats have urged the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, to ensure every school has enough tests in place. The Lib Dem education spokesperson, Munira Wilson, said: “Nadhim Zahawi must provide a cast-iron guarantee that every child and teacher who needs a Covid test will be able to access one on the first day of term, to avoid yet more disruption to schools next week.” “We cannot afford a repeat of last year’s fiasco when pupils returned for one day before being sent home again,” she added. A Department for Education spokesperson said the government had delivered 28m test kits to schools in the final two weeks of last term. “Schools and colleges use a different priority supply route to get their lateral flow tests. Most kits have already been received for the start of the new term and we have emergency arrangements in place to make sure every school has the testing it needs,” the spokesperson said. One south London headteacher, Ben Roberts, of Heathbrook primary school in Lambeth, said his school had ordered tests from the DfE two weeks before the end of term and was yet to receive them. He said he had been touring local pharmacies trying to obtain test kits. “We were expecting staff to go in for an inset day on Tuesday. If staff haven’t had a test prior to that, all we’re doing is super-spreading again. So I for the last few days have been trying every which way to get hold of any more.” The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (PSNC), which represents NHS community pharmacies in England, said some pharmacy staff were being verbally abused when stocks of lateral flow tests run out, after “exceptionally high” levels of demand.Alastair Buxton, the PSNC’s director of NHS services, said: “Public demand for test kits remains exceptionally high and, despite UKHSA delivering some 2m tests to pharmacy wholesalers on some days, this is still falling short of demand. “Members of the public being directed to pharmacies for tests are rightly frustrated when they cannot get them, but it’s concerning that some pharmacy teams say they are still being verbally abused when this happens,” he said.",News/World news,Javid urged to prioritise Covid tests for NHS workers or risk patient harm,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/javid-urged-to-prioritise-covid-tests-for-nhs-workers-or-risk-patient-harm
