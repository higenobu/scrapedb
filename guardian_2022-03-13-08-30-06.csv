3/13/2022,"The Museum of Modern Art in midtown Manhattan was evacuated on Saturday, amid reports that police confirmed two people were stabbed inside. The New York police department said the area around the museum had been closed off. “Due to a police investigation, avoid the area of 53rd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenue,” a tweet said. “Expect emergency vehicles in the surrounding area.” MoMA is located on 11 West 53rd Street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues. Citing unnamed police officials, outlets including the Associated Press and NBC New York reported that two people were stabbed inside the museum around 4pm. The two people were taken to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, the reports said, adding that police said their injuries were not expected to be life-threatening. Witnesses tweeted videos of the evacuation. Alyssa Katz, deputy editor of The City, an independent New York news nonprofit, wrote: “Went to meet friends at MoMA Greeted with a stampede of people fleeing. Museum being evacuated.” Katz said she had spoken to visitors from France who said they “saw someone stabbed in the underarm on the first floor”. Katz also said she had seen New York police officers interviewing witnesses. “Another witness said two workers stabbed,” she added. “The scene here is calm, considering.” Another Twitter user wrote: “We weren’t told what was going on, just that they had to close the exhibits immediately. A woman did say it was an emergency. It was handled very well. Hats off to the workers and NYPD.”",News/US news,New York police close area around MoMA after two people stabbed,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/12/new-york-moma-museum-modern-art-stabbing-evacuation
3/13/2022,"People who open their homes to Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion will get £350 a month under a “cash for accommodation” scheme, as ministers try to make amends for the UK’s chaotic response to the crisis. In a humiliation for Priti Patel, the home secretary, who has been heavily criticised for failing to remove bureaucratic visa requirements for refugees that have been waived by other European countries, fellow cabinet minister Michael Gove announced the plan last night, calling for a “national effort” on behalf of people in desperate need. Gove, secretary for levelling up, housing and communities said: “The crisis in Ukraine has sent shock waves across the world as hundreds of thousands of innocent people have been forced to flee their homes, leaving everything they know and love.” Under the scheme Ukrainians who are matched and housed with a UK “sponsor” will be granted leave to remain for three years. They will be able to work, claim benefits and access public services in that time. The UK-based sponsors, who will be able to register to take in refugees on a website to be launched on Monday, will be asked to provide homes or a spare room rent-free for as a long as they can, with a minimum requirement of six months. Those applying will be vetted and Ukrainian applicants will undergo security checks. Last night there was some scepticism from refugee experts about whether such a system could work. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the success of the scheme would depend on the fine detail, such as whether households would be given support to look after inevitably traumatised and vulnerable refugees, the vast majority of whom will be women and children. “These people are going to be highly traumatised and disoriented and you can’t just put them in people’s homes without any expert casework support,” he said. “It’s a bit like asking people to become foster carers without having a social worker in place. There needs to be good quality specialist support otherwise it risks relationships breaking down. In the long term they will need their own stable accommodation as they may not be able to return to their homeland for a few years.” While Boris Johnson, the prime minister, has claimed repeatedly that the UK has been leading the international response to the crisis, his government has been widely criticised for its slow response. While Ukrainians faced numerous hurdles when applying to come the UK, they were quickly granted permission to enter EU countries for three years with no visa. It is understood that Johnson has become increasingly frustrated with Patel on the refugee issue. After opting to become the only country in Europe to introduce a visa regime for the refugees it emerged last Sunday that just 50 visas had been granted in the 10 days since Russia invaded Ukraine. At the same time the EU had given sanctuary to 1.4 million refugees. Patel is also under pressure to explain a series of misleading statements made by her and her officials in the past week. In a Sun column Patel wrote she was considering a new route for refugees, but there was no new route. Patel then revealed a visa application centre had been established in Calais, but this was also not the case. On Wednesday, the Home Office said the centre was actually in Lille but would not disclose the location and eventually it emerged there was also no centre there either. Seventeen days into the invasion, it is understood the Home Office has granted around 1,000 visas – fewer than 60 a day as an average of around 150,000 Ukrainians leave their country daily. Latest data from the UN refugee agency reveals that more than 2.5 million refugees have fled. When the Home Office was asked to provide an update on figures it did not respond. A previous community sponsorship scheme, largely aimed at welcoming Syrians, has proved relatively slow and bureaucratic with only around 700 individuals receiving such support since 2015. Early indications are that the new scheme will, though, receive far more offers. An Opinium poll for the Observer suggested that almost one in three Britons may be willing to invite a Ukrainian refugee to live with them. Nine per cent said they would definitely do so, while 20% said maybe. Yegor Lanovenko of the Opora network, which is helping Ukrainians to reach the UK, said they had started recording interest in the scheme. “We have started registering interest from sponsors and those looking for sponsorship in anticipation of the government announcing the details and have had over 60 expressions of interest in the last 40 hours despite not even actively advertising this.” Government sources said the £350 per month payment will not increase if the sponsor takes more than one person or a family. Ministers say they are also working to allow communities, the voluntary sector and organisations such as charities and religious groups to sponsor groups of Ukrainians. The UK’s chaotic approach to the crisis has prompted numerous calls for Patel to resign. On Saturday the Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey became the latest, describing Patel’s response as “utterly shameful”. In an apparent admission that the government’s response to the refugees has been inadequate, it was announced last week that Richard Harrington would become minister for refugees to work across both the Home Office and Gove’s Department for Levelling Up. The Observer has been told by sources present at a meeting on Friday – one of Harrington’s first in his new role – that the new minister described its sponsorship approach as a move towards the “privatisation” of the UK’s resettlement programme. The term “didn’t go down well” among many of those present, said the source.",News/World news,Gove bids to end Ukrainian refugee chaos with £350 ‘cash for rooms’ offer,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/gove-bids-to-end-ukrainian-refugee-chaos-with-350-cash-for-rooms-offer
3/13/2022,"In return for a taste of his whisky, no less, singer-songwriter Kenny Rogers was once given some awfully vague advice: “The secret to survivin’,” the Gambler told him on a train bound for nowhere, “is knowin’ what to throw away and knowin’ what to keep.” Thanks for that, Gambler, care to elaborate? “You’re got to know when to hold ’em, know when to fold ’em.” Yes, Gambler, but how? The boards of Leicester and Arsenal may have found themselves humming that tune earlier this season when they heard calls to sack their managers. The cries for Brendan Rodgers to be strapped into a train bound for Mutualconsentville never got as loud as the ones aimed at Mikel Arteta but there were mumblings among some fans, nonetheless, that he may have reached the end of the line with Leicester. Giving up the FA Cup by losing 4-1 to Nottingham Forest in February was a low point from which it was hard to return. But Leicester, like Arsenal, knew what not to throw away and as the clubs prepare to meet at the Emirates on Sunday, each can be satisfied that they are now stronger. On Friday, Rodgers praised Arsenal for sticking with Arteta but he could easily have been talking about himself and Leicester when he said: “They supported him, which is great. He’s a really gifted coach and they’ve shown patience.” Rodgers has earned patience during his term at Leicester and he has now got his team into a state where they could do the reverse of the last two campaigns by ending strongly. Most of Leicester’s problems have been caused by injuries. Those are starting to abate at last, with even the brilliant young centre-back Wesley Fofana scheduled to make his first appearance of the season next week. Rodgers has suggested that the prospect of the Frenchman returning may partly explain why Daniel Amartey and Caglar Soyuncu have suddenly become so solid in recent weeks. “Sometimes the best coach is competition,” said Rodgers, underplaying his own contribution – because adjustments made by the manager are the other reason why Leicester go into Sunday’s match having kept three consecutive clean sheets for the first time this season. Rodgers has tightened up his team by slightly curbing his attacking instincts, prioritising solidity and dynamism. “We had to get back to what we’re all about,” said Rodgers. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall on the left-hand side of midfield and the indefatigable Marc Albrighton on the right have been instrumental in that, their energy and doggedness helping to stimulate upturns in form from Youri Tielemans, Wilfred Ndidi and the centre-backs. Leicester have become a coherent, resilient whole again, able to stay in game even when not playing particularly well. Not only have they avoided conceding in their last three matches, they have struck last-minute goals in two of them, at Burnley two weeks ago and against Rennes on Thursday. “Speaking to one of the French outlets after that game, they felt we looked much stronger than Rennes and our game experience showed at the end,” Rodgers said. “That was good to hear from people who maybe don’t watch as much of us but saw how we managed the game. We’ve had some harsh lessons this year in terms of giving away late goals. You can take that as long as you go away and learn. That’s part of how we’re evolving.” It will be interesting to see what evolution means for James Maddison. Having regained his form and excelled, he suffered a minor injury that cost him his starting place last month. Since then his role has been as a high-impact substitute, sent on to dazzle on a stage built by more dynamic players. His creativity is undeniable, his effect on the team’s balance more difficult to define. “We have to pick a team that isn’t just for the best players,” says Rodgers. One player practically certain to start against Arsenal is Harvey Barnes. Having overcome the fitness problems that hampered him earlier in the season, the 24-year-old has found such consistency that he has become Leicester’s most thrilling attacker and also less predictable to opponents. “There were certain elements of his game where when he got into certain positions you could probably read what he was going to do – but now you can’t,” said Rodgers. “Now he comes inside or he can bend the ball in or fake to come into the first post. Or he looks like he’s coming inside but goes outside. That’s just the development of his game, through training, coaching and his own analysis and constant work. “He looks like he’s going to create and score in every game he plays. And the balance of the team is really good. The two players on the left side – Luke [Thomas], Kiernan – they feed him early. It’s great to see.”",Sport/Football,Revitalised Leicester reaping rewards after holding with Brendan Rodgers | Paul Doyle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/12/revitalised-leicester-reaping-rewards-after-holding-with-brendan-rodgers
3/13/2022,"Frank Lampard clearly suspected things could get worse for Everton when he dissected the first home defeat of his short reign, against Manchester City. But how much worse, and how quickly, will have alarmed a manager who has projected confidence from the moment he was tasked with avoiding the club’s first relegation in 71 years. “Don’t look too much at the table for the next few weeks,” he said a fortnight ago. “I am not buying time with that, we have a lot of points to play for. If we play with the energy and passion we did today, my feeling is, we will be fine.” Then came Tottenham, and a performance so abject that Everton looked condemned at Premier League level. Two home games in the next five days, against Wolves on Sunday and Newcastle on Thursday, will have a major bearing on the final verdict. “I am not going to lie and say I don’t look at the table,” says Anthony Gordon, the homegrown forward who has sparkled in the rough this season. “I am a human being and I check the scores after games. We are very aware of the position we are in. What choice do we have? It is our fault we are there. We have got to fight. “Tottenham was the lowest I’ve felt all season. It was probably one of the lowest I’ve felt in my career. I think it was the heaviest defeat I’ve suffered. I haven’t been the easiest person to be around over the last few days but I’ve still got the same work ethic and am still doing all the right things. I’m ready to go again.” In cold Premier League terms there has been no managerial bounce since Lampard succeeded Rafael Benítez five weeks ago. Four defeats in five top-flight games represents a deflating start, although the new manager’s record reads three wins in seven matches with FA Cup victories against Brentford and non-league Boreham Wood included. There has, however, been a marked improvement in the intensity, organisation and overall quality of Everton’s home performances. An instant connection between Lampard and the Everton fanbase has turned Goodison Park from a toxic environment into an asset once again. With seven home league games remaining, and the “night and day” contrast with their away form, as Lampard described it on Monday, it is clear where potential salvation lies. “Not many teams have the fanbase we have,” says Gordon. “So when you experience games at Goodison the atmosphere is incredible. It gives players a massive boost. It is like that all over the league but even more so with us because of the massive fanbase. Away from home I put it down to us having a tough season, the squad has lost confidence over time, and it can be tough to go away without confidence. “We can’t keep making the same mistakes. The good teams don’t make the same mistakes twice. It’s got to be top performance after top performance and that takes character and togetherness within the team. It’s difficult because I don’t think you can build character – it has to be already in you. It’s about having your own individual pride as a player – 1 to 11. If you’ve got that then you’ll be fine. We just need to stick together and bring it out of each other more. It’s about taking that little bit of responsibility yourself and holding each other accountable. If we do that, then we’ll be fine.” Some have been ludicrously quick to pin the very real threat of relegation on Lampard, as though five weeks with a team that had collected six points from the previously available 42 before he arrived is long enough to address six years of damaging mismanagement under Farhad Moshiri. The same critics shovel the falsehood that Benítez was hounded out of Everton because of his Liverpool history, when it was appalling results, performances and internal divisions that did for the most misguided of managerial appointments. That is also on Moshiri who, along with trying to finance the new £500m-plus stadium at Bramley Moore dock, has had to cut commercial sponsorship ties with his business associate the oligarch Alisher Usmanov as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A first relegation since 1951 would have dire financial consequences for a club already navigating Premier League profit and sustainability rules. This is not to give Lampard a free pass for Monday’s drubbing at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. He was visibly shocked by events; those who have seen Everton concede five goals or more in a game eight times over the past five seasons, less so. He attributed the 5-0 loss to individual errors and bad defending. Both are long-term failings. No Premier League team have conceded more own goals than Everton’s four this season or made more errors leading to a goal than their eight. But a gameplan that exposed a weak Everton defence to Spurs’ well-honed counterattack and failed to yield a shot on target for the second away game in succession, also contributed to an 11th consecutive Premier League trip without a win. “Every gameplan we’ve had has been right and that comes from the manager and his staff preparing us well. I’m not just saying that, it’s really my opinion,” Gordon says. “But as players I feel we’ve let him and the staff down by losing our heads a bit and going away from the gameplan when things get tough.” The 21-year-old is as spirited and impressive when interviewed as he has been on the pitch during a breakthrough season at Everton. Having grown up in Kirkdale, close to Goodison, he is acutely aware of the criticism that followed the heavy defeat at Spurs. “I can totally understand why people might think we don’t care but football is our life,” he says. “We give everything to it. If you look at it from that perspective, it’s stupid to think a player doesn’t care. “We are in here day in, day out. We eat right, we sleep right, we give our lives to it. Everyone here cares. It’s a massive deal and we’re striving together. It’s a difficult period, but tough times bring out the best in people.” Does he not worry that this tough period will end in relegation? “Not at all,” says Gordon. “Because I see how good we can be. And it’s really annoying. To see us not do that week in, week out is really disappointing but I know we can do it, so I don’t have any worry. If we just get certain things right then all the worry will disappear.”",Sport/Football,‘It’s our fault we are there’: Anthony Gordon urges players to lift Everton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/12/anthony-gordon-everton-frank-lampard
