2/28/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Satellite imagery taken on Sunday showed a large deployment of Russian ground forces including tanks moving in the direction of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv from approximately 40 miles (64 km) away, a private U.S. company said. The images released by Maxar Technologies Inc showed a deployment comprised of hundreds of military vehicles and extending more than 3.25 miles (5 km), Maxar said. The convey was situated northeast of the Ukrainian city of Ivankiv and contained fuel, logistics and armored vehicles including tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and self-propelled artillery, it said. The satellite images also showed damage caused by recent airstrikes on the Antonov airport in Hostomel, and heavy fighting in and near the airport, Maxar reported. Maxar has been tracking the buildup of Russian forces for weeks. Its images could not be independently verified by Reuters.

2/28/2022,"PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo has asked the United States to establish a permanent military base in the country and speed up its integration into NATO after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Kosovo's Defence Minister Armend Mehaj said on Sunday. The United States has already 635 soldiers in the Balkan country to maintain the fragile peace as part of a NATO peacekeeping mission. ""Accelerating Kosovo's membership in NATO and having a permanent base of American forces is an immediate need to guarantee peace, security and stability in the Western Balkans,"" Mehaj said on his Facebook page. Kosovo has joined other countries in introducing sanctions against Russia. Mehaj has said that his government was ready to offer help for any military operation to Ukraine, should that be asked for by Washington. Kosovo's 2008 independence is recognised by more than 110 countries, mainly Western nations, but not by Serbia or its traditional ally Russia. Four NATO members also refuse to recognise Kosovo's independence. Kosovo is still not a United Nations member over objections from Russia.

2/28/2022,"By Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia, frustrated by early battlefield setbacks in Ukraine, could be shifting its strategy to siege warfare just as President Vladimir Putin raises the risk of a catastrophic miscalculation by putting nuclear forces on heightened alert, a senior U.S. defense official said on Sunday. Putin gave the order to his nuclear forces as Washington assesses that Russian troops have made limited progress in their four-day-old invasion due to stiff Ukrainian resistance and planning failures that have left some units without fuel or other supplies, U.S. officials said. As missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities, hundreds of thousands of civilians, mainly women and children, were fleeing the Russian assault into neighboring countries. The United States assesses that Russia has fired more than 350 missiles at Ukrainian targets so far, some hitting civilian infrastructure, the senior U.S. defense official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Still, it had so far mainly focused on military targets. Citing a Russian offensive on the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, north of Kyiv, the official cited early indications that Russia might be adopting siege tactics. ""It appears that they are adopting a siege mentality, which any student of military tactics and strategy will tell you, when you adopt siege tactics, it increases the likelihood of collateral damage,"" the official said. So far, the Russian offensive cannot claim any major victories. Russian has not taken any Ukrainian city, does not control Ukraine's airspace, and its troops remained roughly 30 km (19 miles) from Kyiv's city center for a second day, the official said. Images on social media showed some Russian military vehicles in Ukraine, including battle tanks, that had apparently been abandoned after running out of fuel, raising questions about logistical failures. ""They simply don't have a lot of experience moving on another nation state at this level of complexity and size,"" the official said. The official said it was unclear whether it was a failure in planning or execution, but added that Russian forces were likely to adapt and overcome the challenges. Russia has still not moved into Ukraine about a third of the troops that Putin had arrayed around its borders, the official said. But it has rapidly increased the number of forces Moscow has sent into Ukraine in recent days. NUCLEAR RISK The Pentagon learned of the heightened Russian alert for its nuclear forces from Putin's televised announcement, the senior U.S. defense official said, instead of from American intelligence sources. Just after Putin spoke, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the top U.S. commander for Europe, General Tod Wolters, held a pre-scheduled meeting at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT) at which they discussed the Russian president's decision. Although Washington was still gathering information, Putin's move was troubling, the official said. ""It's clearly, essentially, putting in play forces that, if there's a miscalculation, could make things much, much more dangerous,"" the official said. Asked whether the United States would continue to provide military assistance to Ukraine following Putin's announcement, the official said: ""That support is going to go forward."" Mick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official and retired CIA paramilitary officer, said he believed Putin's decision to elevate the alert of his nuclear forces was a reaction to battlefield losses. ""Russia placing its nuclear forces on alert is incredibly reckless and a clear indication that Putin realizes his military is not performing as expected in Ukraine,"" Murloy said.

2/28/2022,"Dmitry Medvedev brushed off sanctions imposed on Russia over the country's invasion of Ukraine. ""We are being driven out of everywhere, punished and threatened, but we don't feel scared,"" he said. In retaliation for the sanctions, Moscow is threatening to back out of a nuclear treaty. A top Russian government official on Saturday warned that Moscow may react to Western sanctions imposed on the country over its invasion of Ukraine by severing diplomatic ties with Western nations and freezing their assets. Dmitry Medvedev, a former president and the deputy chairman of Russia's security council, said the country would also back out of the previous nuclear arms deal made with the United States, The Associated Press reported. Medvedev also threatened to bring back the death penalty after criticizing the ""really unfair"" decision by the Council of Europe — an international human rights organization — to suspend the country's membership. The recently-imposed restrictions are putting a bind on Russian financial operations, per The AP. President Joe Biden this week issued two rounds against Russia, and the administration initially declined to push for booting the country from SWIFT, the dominant system for global financial transactions. European leaders were also somewhat reluctant to remove Russia from SWIFT and risk doing ""more costly and complicated"" business with Russia given the reliance by many countries on Russia's energy exports, The New York Times reported. However, on Saturday, the US, Canada, and its European allies agreed to block ""selected"" Russian banks from SWIFT, according to a White House statement. Medvedev in recent days on a Russian social media platform mocked the sanctions as a form of Western ""political impotence"" that will only further antagonize Russia and harden backlash against the West, according to The AP. ""We are being driven out of everywhere, punished and threatened, but we don't feel scared,"" he said, criticizing the Western-led sanctions as a means of absolving themselves from ""shameful decisions, like a cowardly retreat from Afghanistan."" Last August, the US ended the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan in a withdrawal that ceased all military presence on the ground in the country. Critics of the exit have expressed concern about the country's long-term stability with the lack of a US, or allied, military presence. Medvedev served as president from 2008 to 2012, while Putin became the country's prime minister due to term limits; the longtime official then became prime minister from 2012 to 2020 while Putin ascended back to the presidency. As president, Medvedev was generally regarded as a more liberal leader than Putin, but his comments on Saturday reflect a sharpness that defined Russia's leadership in previous decades. Medvedev on Saturday said that the sanctions could lead Moscow to back out of the New START nuclear arms treaty, a nuclear arsenal reduction agreement that was signed in 2010 by Medvedev and then-US President Barack Obama. The treaty ""limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, and envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance,"" The AP reported. The agreement, which was slated to expire in February 2021, was extended for five additional years by the US and Russia. Russia opting out of the treaty would be a troubling step backward for the global nuclear disarmament effort. Medvedev also downplayed the need for diplomatic ties with Western countries, contending that ""there is no particular need in maintaining diplomatic relations"" and stating that ""we may look at each other in binoculars and gun sights,"" The AP reported. The former president further threatened to impose economic sanctions against the West to counter the sanctions levied on Russia. ""We would need to respond in kind by freezing the assets of foreigners and foreign companies in Russia ... and possibly by nationalizing the assets of those who come from unfriendly jurisdictions,"" Medvedev said. ""The most interesting things are only starting now.""
