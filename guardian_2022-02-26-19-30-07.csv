2/26/2022,"At least 198 Ukrainians, including three children, have been killed, according to the head of the Russian health ministry. A further 1,115 people, including 33 children, have been wounded. Reuters said it was as yet unclear whether he was only referring to civilian casualties. There was heavy fighting in Kyiv on Friday night as Russian ground forces attacked on multiple fronts across the city. Ukrainian armed forces said they resisted Russian advances on an army base and a major road. Five Ukrainians speak here about how they’ve been affected since the Russian invasion of their country. I am in Bucha. It is a few kilometres from the airport where the fighting has been going on. We are sitting with children and dogs most of the time in the basement. We don’t have the internet here. When it calms down a bit, we go outside and try to connect to wifi. There are nine adults, three children, four dogs, one cat and one parrot here. The first shock has gone. We’ve already got used to the sounds of shelling and explosions so we are not scared any more to go outside to message people. Though we have already had the war for eight years, it is still impossible to believe that there are bombs and missiles in the centre of Europe. And we don’t understand what the world is waiting for with sanctions. Evgenija, 47, journalist, Bucha, Kyiv Oblast Right now, I’m with my family, in Kharkiv. Yesterday we moved to a private house of our friend where there’s a cellar. We did it because our own apartment is located in a 16-floor building in a neighbourhood close to the exit of the city, a ring road. Since yesterday, one of the most serious fights for Kharkiv has been happening there. We are not leaving the home. Just sitting here, constantly talking to friends and monitoring the news. It’s hard to describe how we feel. We still can’t believe it. Still shocked. Anxious. Sad. Angry. We feel hatred. And proud of our brave heroes – our army. We are afraid of being occupied by the Russians. We want to be able to continue living in an independent, free, developing Ukraine. We don’t want to hide our identity and our beliefs in European values. Nika, 30, English teacher, Kharkiv I escaped Kyiv yesterday in the early morning, shortly after waking up due to missile attacks at approximately 5am. I already had an evacuation plan and all my things packed, so it was almost with no issues, except traffic jams all the way to the west. I took my parents with me, thank God. I told them to pack their backpacks on Wednesday evening. That was crucial; many of those who told me this would never happen didn’t manage to escape the city. Now I’m in a small village in the west of Ukraine, where I originated from. I don’t hear any shelling now, but it feels no safer. The news is crushing my heart. I’m praying for our army and hoping a bit that the “free world” will help us somehow. Also, I’m pushing some posts and tweets on what’s happening and sending my savings to the Ukrainian army. Vik, 33, graphic designer, Kyiv My parents are living in Ukraine while I am currently overseas. While they call it a “blessing” because I am safe, I feel absolutely helpless and the pain I experience is endless and bottomless. “Your father doesn’t want to hide in a bunker,” my mum texted me this morning. Fifteen minutes later I see push notification from the news channel saying a place next to them was bombed. My world ceased to exist that second. That moment you know precisely where in the chest your heart is located, because sharp pain cuts it into a million pieces. This pain is physical. Minutes of silence feel like eternity. “We are OK,” mum texts and I burst into tears. This war tears apart families. My father’s sister was also born in Ukraine, moved to Russia in the 70s, she is an incredibly intelligent woman, highly educated, working in academia in Moscow. She says war is our fault. She believes Ukrainians have been killing and torturing Russian kids in Donetsk for the last eight years and now Russia must save them. She believes Russian media and says we are making stuff up. Well, I guess I don’t have a family in Russia any more. My grandparents fought in the second world war and it might sound awful but I am glad they passed away. I am glad they don’t see how nations who were fighting next to each other can now kill each other, how a sister can believe propaganda and fake media but not her own brother who is hiding in a bunker, how the peaceful land they saved in the 40s is destroyed again and people are bleeding. Karina, 33, data scientist, from Ukraine and working in the Middle East In Ukraine it’s a whole mobilisation right now, from age 18 to 60. You cannot leave the country now, it’s a mandatory rule. At 5am on Thursday, my brother called me and said: “War just started. Russia attacked Ukraine.” And that was it. Until it happened we did not believe that this could happen at all. My parents and my brother are in Kyiv. Every half an hour there is bombing, so they go to the underground bomb shelter for safety. Kyiv was peaceful when I left on February 22. A lot of our western partners like Biden said there was a possible attack, but we did not believe it. We thought there could be escalation, but did not believe it would be a full-scale invasion. We believed in diplomatic solutions to problems. I’m returning to Ukraine to join the army. [My family] disagree with my decision to enlist because there is a lot of fear, but it’s my country. I do not know how to live in Ukraine without freedom, without the rule of law. I don’t want it to go back to the Soviet Union. I was born in a free country, and I will die in a free country.

2/26/2022,"When Aaron Stern considers what inspires his work, he is reminded of the Leonard Cohen lyric, “There’s a crack in everything. That’s how the light gets in.” In March 2020, as New York City began to shutter and fall silent, the photographer’s busy schedule cleared. He had nothing to do but walk and shoot. “Seeing 80,000 people empty out of the city I’ve called home for 21 years – it was ominous, and fascinating,” he says. “I was trying to find some humour, some lightness.” In the end, he found it in the window of Arturo’s, a pizza place in Lower Manhattan. “The fake relic brought the collapse of Rome to mind, and the fall of that civilisation and democracy, while the glamorous Joe DiMaggio era that once embodied New York is also long gone,” he says. “Here I am, in this post-truth era, post-Capitol attacks, with this disease that’s killing thousands, and I stumbled across this juxtaposition of two previous eras that have also ended. It captured just what I was thinking about.” Stern took this with his main camera, but as he uses film and the labs were closed, he repeated the shot on his iPhone. His work from this period now features in a book: Madam, Nurses Run. He says of the mood among the New Yorkers who also stayed behind: “There was resilience, camaraderie and pride. In a country that’s never been more divided, New Yorkers still get through things together.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"‘Seeing 80,000 people leave the city was ominous, and fascinating’: Aaron Stern’s best phone picture",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/26/aaron-stern-best-phone-picture-new-york
2/26/2022,"In 2017, Stephanie Foo was slapped with a complex PTSD diagnosis. She was dumbfounded. Foo, a successful podcast producer on shows like This American Life, had heard of PTSD – the disorder associated in popular culture with war veterans who witnessed death, or had guns held to their heads. She knew those afflicted were frequently revisited by traumatic memories, often in flashbacks playing before their eyes. Complex PTSD was supposed to be worse: while PTSD is generally caused by singular traumatic events, complex PTSD survivors have usually been exposed to trauma repeatedly, sometimes over years, making it hard to isolate triggers and move past them. Foo had somehow relegated her own trauma to the back drawers of her mind. She had become accustomed to rushing through the details of her abuse, as if reading from a grocery list: she was physically abused as a child; regularly told she was stupid, unwanted, ugly and fat; exposed to deathly car trips during which her father told her he was going to kill them both; and was abandoned by both parents as a teenager, left with no money to survive on frozen meals. The abuse settled into her psyche, making it hard for her to accept love from anyone. She was prone to outbursts and over-reliant on validation, especially at work. She was miserable for a long time, but didn’t know why. In her new book, What My Bones Know: A Memoir of Healing from Complex Trauma, she grapples with the aftermath of her diagnosis and tries to provide a roadmap to help others heal. Poppy Noor: Before we start this interview, I should tell you I also have a complex PTSD diagnosis. When I found out, I thought it was the most damning thing in the whole world, because I heard it was basically incurable. I felt very alone. But since I started reading your book, I’ve had people come up to me in public and ask me about it, or give me a knowing nod. Do you think complex PTSD might be more prevalent than we realize? Stephanie Foo: I think it’s under-diagnosed simply because people don’t know about it. It’s not in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in the US. But also, there’s this idea that, well, “I didn’t have a gun in my head in Afghanistan. So how could I have PTSD?” But one in six people have an ACE score [an indicator of a level of childhood trauma that could cause serious health repercussions] over six. That’s like 50 million people. So I think it’s a big thing. A lot of your book is about the erasure of trauma. For example, when kids are doing well at school, we assume they can’t be traumatized. We also ignore immigrant trauma, because it’s an uncomfortable stain for the US – and it’s an uncomfortable burden for a lot of immigrants trying to assimilate. I have friends who start teaching at all-Asian schools and they’re delighted by the Asian kids who are just so studious, so excited about learning and so hardcore about getting good grades. That’s comfortable, right? Why would you want to further investigate, to see whether [the reason] all these students want to have perfect grades and freak out otherwise, is because they’re being abused at home? Capitalism and academic success have buried trauma. It’s also about the value we ascribe to work. I remember saying to my therapist once that I was worried I wasn’t good at writing. And she said, and what if you’re not? Does that make you an unworthy person? I was so confused. I was thinking, what does anyone else judge themselves by? It’s like we have to earn love as if it is a commodity. You struggle with your diagnosis throughout the book. A lot of the scientific literature says people with complex PTSD are damaged and hard to fix. But you acknowledge the strength that can come with trauma. I thought that idea was incredibly healing. I kept seeing these TikToks where people say stuff like: “Am I careful at my job, or was I abused as a child?” It just seemed to be creating this binary or this pathology: I’m a perfectionist, or a multitasker, or a people-pleaser - I guess it’s because I was abused. Not every aspect of your trauma makes you a toxic person. So you’re a people-pleaser – okay, you’re charming. Is that really so bad? You can learn to draw healthier boundaries, so you can people-please while not making yourself feel bad. But you don’t need to pathologize it. What you’re saying is, not all of it needs to be fixed just because it came from trauma. I had a lot of grit throughout my life that made me work really hard. For a long time, I was really resentful and angry, especially after my diagnosis, because work wound up being a symptom. It was workaholism – I was working to avoid confronting my trauma. What I’ve come to learn is that I have to change the voice in my head. It used to be if I wasn’t working, the voice would say, “You’re lazy, you’re a piece of shit, you’re not trying hard enough, because you’re a bad person.” Now, I’ve been able to change it to, “This is something you really care about, get stoked, you have the work ethic and the skills this trauma has built you over time. And now you can use all of that!” I don’t know if I’m necessarily grateful, because of all the other stuff that it comes with. But I’m happy with the way that I’m able to use it. The important thing in healing is being able to hold the nuance of it. Why do so many books speak about trauma in that way, like everything is a symptom that needs to be fixed? The way we view trauma in this country is deeply broken. Because if you have complex PTSD, you’re probably going to have some deep feelings of shame and self-loathing. And if you are just diagnosing people by saying, “here are all the things that are wrong with you, you’re pathologically broken”, those people are not going to be able to heal. We need to say: “You’re not neurotypical. But there are advantages and disadvantages. Let’s explore how you can have better coping mechanisms for some of the disadvantages that you might be experiencing.” Speaking of how we talk about trauma – the word itself seems to be having a moment. As you said, it’s everywhere on TikTok, people are using words like “triggered” colloquially – do you think the way that we’re talking about it is a good thing? Everyone has trauma, or will have trauma. Suffering is life and loss is part of life; you’re going to lose people and you’re going to be miserable. If we understand that, then we can normalize it more. I think it’s weird that if someone says, “I’m dead!”, people are like, “That’s really disrespectful to dead people.” Of course some people are gonna misuse it. Some people are gonna make jokes - I make jokes all the time. I’m always like, “I’m triggered!” Life is funny. It doesn’t have to be that serious all the fucking time. That’s a part of normalization. And I think normalization is a good thing. In your book you explore how many people are in denial about the trauma within their own communities, or their own families. Why are you so keen for people to talk about it? I think that one of the reasons why I wasn’t able to heal for so long is because I buried it. I was like, look at me, I’m on [the podcast] This American Life. How could somebody on This American Life have trauma? It’s ridiculous in retrospect. You can’t heal without acknowledgment. We have to normalize therapy – not just, like, talk therapy or psychotherapy. We have to normalize different generations of Americans working through trauma. At the end of the book you start talking about trauma survivors as having “superpowers”. I wasn’t used to reading about it in that way, and it made me feel better – because I spend so much time trying to “outpace” my trauma. That was a useful way of reframing it for me. What do you hope that this book will do for other people? I don’t want people to have that hopelessness upon diagnosis. I wanted to counter some of the prevailing narratives put out by scientists and doctors who don’t have complex PTSD, and clearly don’t know what it’s like. I would love for teachers, particularly in immigrant communities, to take child abuse more seriously. And to understand that just because you’re not seeing it doesn’t mean it’s not there. I would just love for complex PTSD to be normalized – like depression, or anxiety, or bipolar disorder. Get it in the goddamn DSM. That is very important. I also want people to know there are superpowers associated with complex PTSD. You have to tell people they are going to be okay. I’m not so naive and vain as to think that this book can change all of these very big systemic things. But if that changes some of these things a little bit, I will be very happy.

2/26/2022,"Iwasn’t like most brides. Unlike my school friends, who adored playing kiss-chase and using their blazers as veils and the chalk hopscotch outline as an aisle, I was more interested in reading and making up stories than dreaming about weddings. As I got older, I was able to use countless examples of the unhappy marriages I had seen around me as an excuse for my wannabe Carrie Bradshaw lifestyle. Receiving a Facebook notification about schoolmates getting hitched never moved or bothered me. And when I heard about glamorous six-figure, three-day wedding parties in Greece or Morocco, all I could think was: “Isn’t the bride tired?” Most importantly, there wasn’t a practical incentive for me to be married. Five decades ago it would have been helpful, as I would have needed a husband to even have a bank account, but thankfully things had changed so much that marriage wasn’t a necessity. But then three things happened. First, someone I found entertaining and considerate came into my life; and, surprisingly, year after year, we seemed to be able to compromise just enough, so that we ended up being together for a decade. Second, life – as in me actually giving birth to it – happened, and I now had to consider how not being married could affect my children when it came to dealing with things such as wills and estates. The third and final nail in my “never a bride” coffin was the pandemic, which of course reminded us all of what really matters, and forced us to properly think about the choices we would make once we were allowed to do more than circle our nearest park. There were other layers to this decision. In 2021 both my partner and son fell very ill with chickenpox, the latter sick enough to be hospitalised. What is usually a simple childhood illness turned out to be a very serious one for a grown man. Both my boys were down and out. It was not only the physical burden of being the only parent that could stay in the hospital, but the worry that neither of them would pull through. My father died suddenly in 2009 from complications derived from the common flu – that experience had given me a proclivity for thinking the worst. No one knows us better than our phones. One night in the hospital at my son’s bedside, after he had been awoken by the kind nurses to have his routine injections for a secondary infection, I tried to soothe myself back to sleep with some social media scrolling. It was then I came across a video of a woman whose boyfriend of 12 years had become very ill and had to be airlifted to hospital. When she tried to go with him, she wasn’t allowed, as she wasn’t married to him. She finished the video by telling people that if they know they are with “their person”, to make it so on paper. Because now, more than ever, we just didn’t know when we would end up in a situation in which we had no say at all. Now that made sense to me. Whereas dresses and the idea of going into debt for the sake of a party had never interested me, the practicality and security of a union with my partner became a priority. It would seem that I wasn’t alone. This year will be a bumper year for weddings, with an estimated 550,000 events planned post-lockdown, after 264,000 couples had to postpone in 2020, according to the UK Weddings Taskforce, the trade body for the industry. When US magazine Brides polled 4,000 readers, it found that 82% of them believed that living through the pandemic had made them want to get married more than before. And, while the pressures of Covid and the lockdowns that followed were really the final straw for many relationships, there are many of us who are now encouraged to run towards the altar, rather than away from it, because lockdown life with our partners turned out better than expected A few months after the last lockdown ended, we went to our local register office. The woman handing out wedding dates warned us that owing to the pandemic backlog we would have to wait 18 months for a slot. Did we understand that, she asked. “Yep,” we both said. We had already done our research and understood that we would have to wait our turn. Plus, what was 18 months to the 10 years we had already been together? A few moments later, the mood changed. “Well, it’s your lucky day: I’ve just refreshed the system and it seems the next available date is in seven weeks. Fancy it?” Later that day, as we got our heads around the fact that we had less than two months to plan a wedding, we agreed that instead of being scared by a date so soon, we were actually really grateful – the sooner the better. The last two years had shown us how much we couldn’t control, and this felt like the one thing we could, to ensure that whoever was left standing between us would be able to have their say when it came to our family and finances. Since the big day a few months ago, outwardly nothing has changed. He still has a certain way he likes the dishwasher to be loaded, and I like to have an hour to myself each night. But inwardly, there has been a shift. I have to be honest and say that this is highlighted by the respect put upon our union by the rest of the world. The other day we went to the bank to do some admin. “Thank God you’re married!” exclaimed the clerk. Upon seeing our expressions, she added hastily: “I’m sure you’re very much in love, but it just gives me far less paperwork to do!” She laughed, and I couldn’t help but join her. She was, like me, looking at marriage for the practicality it is. A woman after my own heart.

2/26/2022,"Thousands of part-time workers at the United Parcel Service (UPS) around the US were recently informed that their hourly wages would be cut, eliminating raises implemented in 2021 at some hubs as a means to attract and retain workers in the tighter labor market. Alex Sanchez, a part-time UPS worker in Ontario, California, for one year, said part-time workers at his hub had their base rate increased in 2021 from $15.33 an hour to $18 an hour. “We were told that the raise was permanent,” said Sanchez. At the end of January, Sanchez said he was informed that his hourly wage and those of every other part-time employee at UPS would revert back to $15.33 an hour. He claimed the wage cut resulted in many workers quitting. “Part-time workers are the backbone of the UPS operation. With inflation, $15.33 an hour is tough for workers and their families,” said Sanchez. “I work two jobs in order to make ends meet. I’m a married father of three. The $3 cut really takes a toll on our family’s budget.” UPS reported record profits in 2021 as it increased shipping prices; its profits grew nearly tenfold in 2021 to $12.89bn from $1.34bn in 2020. Its stock price hit a record high in February 2022. UPS is projecting more growth in 2022, with the expectation to hit 2023 financial goals a year early. The company approved a $5bn stock buyback program in August 2021. Teamsters local unions at UPS have been holding protests against the pay cuts for part-timers, which have been up to $6 an hour in cuts for some workers. Peter Nuñez, the UPS NorCal committee chairman and president of Teamsters Local 431 in Fresno, California, explained UPS used market rate adjustment wage increases outside contractually negotiated wages to help attract and retain workers in many areas, but the increases were stripped from part-time employees without warning. According to Nuñez, eight out of 15 locals in northern California were affected by market rate adjustments, affecting about 4,000 employees in the region. “For them to eliminate that market rate adjustment, with no warning and no care for those employees who have been used to making that $21 an hour, it’s a pretty heavy hit to take if you’re a part-time employee now,” said Nuñez. “We don’t believe it’s just nor do we believe it’s fair and we’re looking to call the company out.” Other Teamsters members and part-time workers at UPS also criticized the sudden pay cut for part-time employees. Ross Richardson, a part-time UPS employee in Indianapolis, Indiana, said he has worked 50 to 60 hours a week despite being classified as part-time through the pandemic. “We were never told it was a market rate adjustment raise and then out of nowhere they handed out a piece of paper on a Wednesday in early January and said effective the following Monday our pay would be reduced to the contracted rate of $15 an hour, after not receiving hazard pay and constantly short-staffed, having to do two and three people’s jobs,” said Richardson. Evelyn Cotton, who works as a comprehensive health and safety process co-chair at UPS in Goodyear, Arizona, criticized the way part-time employees were informed of the pay cut and claimed many workers quit after being told of it. “I was extremely ashamed over the handling of pay cuts for employees,” said Cotton. “These people were never told about this cut because most are not union or have no clue about it.” Alexis Torres, a part-time UPS employee for three years in California and a mother of four, experienced a wage cut of nearly $5 an hour at her hub, which has caused morale at her job to drop. “It’s difficult to work long hours with a smile on my face knowing I’ll barely make enough to pay my rent while UPS has had some of their highest grossing years recently,” said Torres. “My body takes a beating every day for what? To watch the CEO cut your pay by $5 an hour. I guess us employees only matter during peak – it feels like we don’t matter the rest of the year.” Torres emphasized she enjoys working at UPS and had started saving up for a house with the wage increase, but that dream was pulled out from under her, as no one said the wage increase was temporary. “Fast-food chains are starting their employees out a dollar more than I’m making now,” Torres said. “If they could cut pay by $5 an hour without my knowledge what else could they do? This is my life, UPS is my life and I feel betrayed.” UPS did not comment on how many part-time employees were affected by recent pay cuts, the local protests over the cuts, or on the impression workers were given that the wage increases were permanent. “UPS part-time Teamsters-represented employees receive $15 per hour plus benefits including paid time off, a pension and healthcare coverage, as established through the collective bargaining process,” said a UPS spokesperson in an email. They added: “To reflect local market conditions, we sometimes provide temporary hourly rate increases or bonuses that are in addition to our contractually agreed upon compensation. These temporary hourly rate increases are based on the time of year, geographic location and type of job. For some part-time employees, we recently changed to a bonus that rewards dependability, which can result in even higher pay for that employee.”",News/US news,‘This $3 cut takes a toll’: UPS slashes pay for part-time workers as profits grow,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/26/ups-part-time-workers-pay-cuts
2/26/2022,"Conscientious travel choices in a time of global warming are not easy. The ethically driven, non-flying British traveller, you might think, will have to accept a life of self-denial: no snorkelling over coral reefs, no wolf watching or walking on glaciers. And what about other wonders, both natural and human-made? Will we never again explore an active volcano, burrow into a bazaar, or lie on a palm-fringed beach beside a warm turquoise sea? I don’t think I’m the only one who recoils in horror at the thought of every summer holiday being a UK washout, counting your goosebumps while sheltering in the bandstand. Over the past two decades, in our rush to embrace budget airlines, other transport systems were allowed to wither, further limiting choices. All ferry routes to Scandinavia, for example, have disappeared, which is a scandalous state of affairs. Getting to Gothenberg, Bergen, Oslo and Esbjerg now entangles the traveller in complex railway journeys through several countries – hence the lack of Scandinavian alternatives in our list. Even a classic tourist town like Bruges in Belgium has become trickier, with the closure of the Hull-Zeebrugge ferry route. The north and west of the UK have been particularly hit by this, with non-flyers forced towards London St Pancras and the Channel tunnel. This is an expensive addition to any trip, often requiring an overnight in London on both legs of a continental journey. However, there is some good news: the coral reefs, glaciers and turquoise seas are all accessible, with one proviso: the journey must become part of the experience. So here is the plan: allowing 48 hours for travelling, where can you get to from the UK without getting on an aeroplane, and on a route that is both interesting and fun? Travel this way and you will complete your trip comfortable in the knowledge that you have barely produced more CO2 than if you had stayed at home. In terms of cost, these trips should not be compared to a budget flight – they are enriching travel experiences in themselves. Prices change regularly and vary depending on exact routes and timings. Useful websites for planning and pricing include directferries.co.uk, rome2rio.com, raileurope.com and thetrainline.com, but it’s also worth checking out individual operators. The estimates given here are a rough guide for a solo traveller, one way from London St Pancras unless stated otherwise, including only basic transport costs in April. Under 36 hours If you go to the trouble of reaching mainland Europe without wings, you have certainly earned the right to visit a glacier – a questionable activity for anyone travelling by aeroplane. European glaciers less than about 45 degrees north of the equator may not be long for this world, but they do exist. Bulgaria’s Snezhnika and Banski Suhodol in the Pirin mountains are the furthest south. Albania, Montenegro and Spain also have areas that pass muster as perennial areas of ice. Given the rate of global warming, however, it may be safer to head for the largest volume of ice that currently exists in the Alps, the 10bn-tonne Aletsch glacier, which is 800 metres thick in places, albeit 200 metres thinner than in 1860. From London, the train to Interlaken takes about 10 hours via Paris and Basel. Spend a night there, or hop up to Grindelwald. Next morning, catch the Jungfraujoch railway: this line spirals up inside the mountain, emerging 3,450 metres up at the head of the Aletsch glacier field. To get your feet on the ice, walk across to the Mönchsjoch hut. It takes about 45 minutes. Alternatively, hike to the Konkordia hut for a night - tours are available. The new Eiger cableway also allows a panoramic version of the journey, but for me the engineering marvel of the railway inside the Alp is unique. That’s all very cushy. For a more energetic alternative, take a train to the lovely Swiss village of Fiesch (an 11-hour journey from London, with changes in Paris, Lausanne and Visp), then spend a night in the village before taking the cable car to Eggishorn for the panoramic Aletsch view. Or take a cable car to Fiescheralp, walk to Eggishorn and stay at Gletcherstube hut. Within 36 hours you will be sleeping beside a glacier. There are numerous excellent winter walks. Estimated cost, one way Train to Interlaken £116, Jungfrau trip £85 (round trip). Total: £201. Just under 48 hours There are those who will tell you that the UK does have coral reefs, and they are correct. Extensive areas of Lophelia pertusa coral were discovered off the Hebrides in 2003. You’re unlikely to be snorkelling over them any time soon, however, as they sit 100 metres beneath the surface, at around about the depth limit for a world-class freediver. What is required is a reef under warm water, and that does pose a challenge. As recently as 2019, researchers in Italy discovered a reef off the coast of Puglia, but once again there was a caveat: this is a mesophotic reef, a low-light version that lives at below 30 metres, not the full-colour, tropical variety. For the nearest thing to a Great Barrier Reef experience, you have to go to Tunisia. Ferry companies always warn passengers to check for “operational changes” and Tunis gets its share. In season you can find services from the Italian ports of Palermo, Salerno (Naples) and Civitavecchia (Rome), but the closest to the UK is Genoa. Starting at London St Pancras, your objective is to catch a Wednesday or Saturday GNV ferry sailing to Tunis, which will probably mean leaving on a Friday afternoon for the Saturday sailing (the journey takes about 20 hours with changes depending on the route). Once you roll into Genoa’s Voltri station, you will wish you had a week to spare for this fine Ligurian city. Sadly we are on a mission and must skip past sights like the Doge’s Palace and Via Garibaldi to take a short bus ride or walk down to the port and the GNV ticket office for checking in (it usually leaves around 3pm). The ferry voyage takes about 24 hours.Once you are out of Tunis port – and it can be a little chaotic – get a taxi for the three-hour ride to Tabarka. So you should be able to check in to your hotel and get down to the beach within 48 hours of setting off. Tabarka is actually a castellated rocky promontory that projects into the Mediterranean from the small town. There’s an extensive coral reef not far from shore, and you can snorkel straight off the beach at Tabarka, or go on day trips to various dive sites. The small La Galite islands also lie 35 miles offshore in a nature reserve that’s also home to Mediterranean monk seals. Estimated cost, one-way Train £143, ferry £82, bus £4 (taxi £40). Total: £229 (£265). About 27 hours Large predators were banned from Britain long ago because they interfered with mutton production, so travellers have to head abroad for a sighting. So is it possible to leave British soil and go wolf, bear or lynx watching within 48 hours? To be honest, it’s unlikely, but not impossible. Rural depopulation in western Europe has certainly led to a resurgence of the wolf. A lone animal was caught on CCTV just 18 miles from Dieppe, northern France, in 2021 – hopefully heading for the Newhaven ferry. The best spot, however, is undoubtedly the Picos de Europa, a wild area of mountain and forest that spreads for 250 sq miles across northern Spain. Take the Brittany ferry service from Plymouth (Wed and Sun), arriving early afternoon the next day in Santander ready to hire a car and get up to a village such as La Hermida, from where you can walk into the high sierras. Going with an expert guide will definitely help. A three-hour drive from Santander is Riaño, in Leòn province, where you can join a tour with a local operator such as WildWatching. There are also no-fly options on tours run from the UK by Naturetrek. Estimated cost, one-way Ferry £101, car hire from £18 a day. Total: from £119 About 36 hours Europe is home to more than 60 active volcanoes, but it’s impossible to know when any of them will next burst into life, making volcanology holidays a tricky business. The spectacular Fagradalsfjall in western Iceland simply ground to a halt on 18 September 2021, having been spouting lava copiously for many months. Furthermore, to a volcanologist an active volcano is one that erupted in the past 10,000 years and still shows signs of activity – not long in geological time, perhaps, but we are in a hurry and want sight of lava spilling from a jagged fissure in the Earth’s crust within our 48-hour time limit. The Smithsonian keeps a weekly report of current eruptions, but most are very far away from the UK. The closest is probably the Phlegraean Fields, an area of 24 calderas west of Naples, where you can see fumaroles and ash cones, but not red-hot rock. Nearby Vesuvius has not erupted since 1944 and is not expected to blow again any time soon. Cumbre Vieja in the Canaries is erupting and can be accessed without wings (ferry from Cadiz), but sadly not inside 48 hours. The best candidate is Etna, a reliably rambunctious erupter. Take the train to Salerno, south of Naples, a journey of around 24 hours from London St Pancras (with four changes), then hop on the Caronte ferry to Messina, departing around 14.30 (times vary according to the day). It’s a nine-hour voyage, during which you will pass the island of Stromboli, another dependable performer, where there was a large pyroclastic flow in August 2019. (You can reach Stromboli from Naples on the hydrofoil in summer.) You might also glimpse another volcano, the island of Vulcano, which is one of the Aeolian group. It’s exhaling smoke and gases at the moment, but no lava. After a brief sleep in Messina, get on the train to Catania, from where you can join a summit tour (the only way to visit the very top of Etna). If you prefer to remain self-guided, stick to the lower-altitude Silvestri craters, though these are inactive. Estimated cost, one-way Train £202, ferry £25, summit tour £47. Total: £274 About 48 hours from the UK Who does not love a shopping centre? By which I do not mean a soulless trudge through chain stores, but the finest consumer experience available on the planet – an oriental bazaar, preferably one built during the Ottoman empire. Istanbul and Isfahan spring to mind as the sublime apotheosis of silky consumerism: piles of spices, hand-woven textiles and rugs, perfumiers who will blend a fragrance to your specification, tea shops and hookah pipes, gemstones and curiosities. Sadly, even in its 1930s heyday, the Orient Express never made it to Istanbul within 48 hours, and the service came to a halt in 2009 (though a luxury service operates as the Venice-Simplon Orient Express). Tunis is a good bet (see our coral reef trip, above) but check out Bosnia and Albania, both of which spent long enough under Ottoman rule to develop good bazaars, which operate still. In pre-Covid times, Sarajevo could be reached directly from London’s Victoria coach station in a single, character-building, bum-busting bus yomp. Slightly more pleasant, perhaps, would be the overnight ferry from Newcastle to Amsterdam (or Harwich-Hook of Holland) and then rail to Passau or Linz on the Germany-Austria border (10 hours), then coach (12 hours)to Sarajevo. Check in to a decent small place like Hotel Aziza, and head for the copper-bashing street of Kazandžiluk in the Stari Bazar. Albania offers a chance to mix things up a bit more: train to Milan, then on south to Bari, followed by an overnight ferry to Durres (departs 22.00), a bus to Tirana, then a taxi to Krujë, where there is a street bazaar. It’s not Aleppo’s Khan al-Harir, but it’s still lovely. Estimated cost to Sarajevo, one-way Ferry £102, train to Passau £33, coach to Sarajevo £35. Total: £170 Estimated cost to Krujë, one-way Train to Bari £148, ferry to Durres £38, bus £4 Krujë (taxi £25). Total: £192 (£211) About 26 hours Lovers of the Cornish Riviera might argue otherwise, but I don’t think Britain can really claim to have a palm-fringed beach, let alone a Caribbean-style one – and carrying your Swiss cheese plant down to Brighton’s shingle doesn’t count. What we require is finely ground white sand washed by a limpid turquoise sea, and then, up the beach, in the shade of a coconut palm, a homespun shack serving fried plantains and glasses of rum punch. Unfortunately, despite global warming, the tropics are not getting any closer. The areas of the planet where the sun is directly overhead remain resolutely distant. The only possible point of contact for the flightless globetrotter is Africa. You could be on a ferry to and well on your way to Morocco, Algeria or even the Canary Islands within 48 hours of leaving Britain (via Barcelona, Marseille and Cadiz respectively), but not actually arriving; so we shall reluctantly discount such exotic destinations. And then there is the difficulty of “palm-fringed” – do we allow planted palms, or must they be natural? To be honest, insistence on wild, self-planted palms is not helpful in this case. Villefranche-sur-Mer on the Côte d’Azur is palm-fringed, and lovely, but the horny hands of some jardinier were involved. But why do we want palms at all? For shade. My suggestion, therefore, is Caribbean-style Cala Llombards on Mallorca – it has the perfect white sand and turquoise warm seas, plus shady trees, even though they are pines. An early train from London will get you to Barcelona in time to board the ferry to Mallorcan capital Palma that same evening. GNV seems to be the cheapest option, but there are other companies. Or you could start out later in the day and spend a night in Paris. Either way you will arrive in Palma at about 6am, which gives you the day to hire a car and drive the 40 miles east to Cala Llombards. As for the fried plantain and rum punch, best to head to Palma’s wonderful Mercat de Santa Catalina for toothsome local specialities. Estimated cost, one-wayTrain £110, ferry £15, car hire £29 a day.

2/26/2022,"When an email from Beyoncé’s office first landed in Warsan Shire’s inbox, she assumed it was some kind of prank. It wasn’t. Beyoncé – the real Beyoncé – was inviting Shire, a 27-year-old British-Somali poet from Wembley, north-west London, to collaborate. The result was the revolutionary 2016 visual album Lemonade, on which Shire is credited with “film adaptation and poetry”; her verses are read aloud between songs. Shire has also since contributed work to Beyoncé’s 2020 film Black is King and wrote a specially commissioned poem, I Have Three Hearts, to announce the singer’s 2017 pregnancy with twins. But even before Beyoncé came knocking, Shire was starward bound. After a responsibility-laden adolescence, spent combining writing with co-parenting her three younger siblings, Shire published her debut chapbook of poems, Teaching My Mother How to Give Birth in 2011, aged just 23. In 2013, she was appointed the first Young People’s Laureate for London and in 2015, her poem Home became a viral anthem for the refugee crisis. Shire’s first full poetry collection, Bless the Daughter Raised by a Voice in Her Head, comes out next month. In between these professional milestones, she also found time to meet and marry a Mexican American charity worker called Andres, move continents, and have two children. For the bestselling author Bernardine Evaristo, all this is a delight but no surprise. “Beyoncé chose to collaborate with Warsan because of the richness of her work,” she says. “It transcends these perceived barriers and boundaries around women’s experiences.” Evaristo was 60 in 2019 when she found her own global fame, by winning the Booker prize with her eighth book, Girl, Woman, Other. Evaristo’s route to the top had been slow and winding, so she determined to blaze a more direct trail for those who came after. With young talent exactly like Shire in mind, she initiated The Complete Works poetry mentoring scheme in 2007 (Shire was a mentee) and founded the Brunel International African Poetry prize in 2012 (Shire was the inaugural winner). This year, Evaristo completes her trek to the apex of the British literary establishment, by assuming the presidency of the Royal Society of Literature (the same august organisation that in 2018 elected Shire as its youngest fellow). Now, on the occasion of the publication of Shire’s collection, she and Evaristo have come together to swap notes on their influences, ideal writing conditions and occasional bouts of impostor syndrome. There was a time when these two women would regularly run into each other at poetry readings and publishing events, but since Shire now lives in Los Angeles, it’s been a while. So when we arrive on the Zoom call – Evaristo from her airy, art-filled London living room and Shire from what looks like a hastily grabbed hiding place in the basement – they get immediately stuck into conversation. It’s full of laughter, mutual admiration and gratitude for the wonders of a life lived in literature. Ellen E Jones Bernardine Evaristo There’s so much to ask you about your journey to where you are now – I mean, it’s just been incredible, hasn’t it? But maybe I’ll kick off with Bless the Daughter Raised by a Voice in Her Head: how does it feel to finally have your first full collection published? Warsan Shire I remember the advice you gave me, to take my time and not rush it. I think, starting off young, I wanted to make sure I didn’t burn out quickly and just release something that I wasn’t really proud of. Also, poetry was always linked to my mental health, as an outlet, so it feels very cathartic to finally let go of this collection. I was writing this book on the precipice of starting my own family. It feels really massive, like I went from a girl to a woman in the middle of writing it. BE This is why you are a really serious writer, because you could have ridden the wave of Lemonade and put out a collection then, but you knew you wanted it to be the best it can be. I really respect that. I think many other people would have thought that if they don’t exploit the moment, it’s gonna pass them by. So, let’s go back to the beginning. Did you start off with Jacob Sam-La Rose’s Barbican Young Poets? WS When I was about 15, Jacob came to a youth club where I lived, in Wembley Central. Because I raised my sisters, it was really difficult to get out, so I had to lie and do all these things to get to the workshop, and I got there a little bit late, stumbled in, but that’s how I met Jacob. After that day, my life was completely changed because I’d met a real-life poet. He introduced me to the works of really amazing Black British poets and writers, and then I was able to actually meet them. So that’s how I got to know Nii [Parkes, poet and co-founder of Shire’s first publisher, Flipped Eye], and that’s how my first chapbook came through. BE That’s such a wonderful introduction to the arts, because you weren’t alienated from the material, y’know? Whereas, with me, when I was your age, it was all white. The struggle for me, as I grew older, was to find Black writers, Black theatre and, in the end, I had to create my own through Theatre of Black Women in the 1980s. The way in which you became part of the poetry community was through a kind of mentoring, wasn’t it? Through Jacob and Nii and then through Pascale Petit and The Complete Works, and it’s so important, when we’re coming from the kind of backgrounds that are underrepresented in literature. WS There’s not a day that goes by when that’s lost on me. I can only imagine how you felt, because before I got to know these people, I thought that becoming a writer was as likely as becoming a Hollywood star. That’s why it’s such an honour to be speaking with you today, because people like you were the reason why any of us have any opportunity at all. I’m just so, so grateful! I hope that I can do something like that for younger writers as well. BE Yes, I think that’s something else that we share. Even though writing is something that’s deep within us, we are still also about our communities. It’s not just art for art’s sake, is it? It’s about being a voice in the world as a Black woman. I mean, do you feel that responsibility? WS I would love to speak to somebody who is from our kind of background, who doesn’t feel the responsibility, because how is that possible? I think whenever you come from a people who don’t have a voice, and you have a voice, how could you not? For those who don’t have to, that is wonderful. I mean, how great that you can write a poem only about garden gnomes and it means nothing other than the beauty of the garden gnome! Like, how gorgeous that you can do that! But also, I want to speak for people. Not only is it necessary and important, it’s also fun! BE Yes, that’s right. It’s not a burden that we carry, is it? It is something that we embrace as really positive. But you see, I grew up in a political family. Both my parents were political activists. My Nigerian immigrant father was a Labour councillor and a socialist, my parents went on demonstrations … You also grew up with politics. I mean, you were in Britain because of the politics of Somalia, right? WS Yes, and my mum has always been this natural feminist, even though she spent her life as a housewife and didn’t really get to go to school. She always relished seeing me be free. My family is a Muslim family, so at times when I would be told: “Hey, you need to wear a hijab,” it would be my mum who’d be like: “She’ll do it when she wants to.” So that just made me feel formidable. My dad’s a writer and he was the reason why we had to leave Somalia. He was writing this book about the corruption in the Somali government, there were threats and intimidation, and ultimately, we had to leave just before the war broke out. He was the first person that introduced to me the idea of being Afrocentric, pan-Africanism, and the history of Somalia. He made me feel really proud to be Black from a very young age. And he also put in me the importance of writing and sharing your stories. So that, mixed with growing up with the backdrop of a civil war – and constantly looking after and meeting traumatised family that had just come from war – all of that came together to create in me this urgency to write. BE I remember you said years ago that everybody in Somalia is a poet: is that true? WS Yeah, it’s very true. That’s why, when I met Jacob, I was like: “Oh, you can do this for a job?” Because, before then, in my home, I was around people just reciting poetry, all willy-nilly. We call it “gabay” in Somalia, and it’s used when a child is born, when somebody dies, when we go to a wedding, when you’re courting somebody, when you’re cursing somebody, when you’re beating your children – there’s something for every single activity in life. When I was born, my grandmother wrote me a poem about how one girl is better than a thousand boys, basically, because everybody wanted the first child to be a boy – y’know, sexism and everything – so, to counteract that, she wrote me this poem. BE So you had the poetry, which was just part of everyday life, and then you had your dad’s politics, your mum’s feminism – I’m psychoanalysing you here, Warsan! And you’ve got the grandmother who says to you, “One girl is equal to a thousand boys” – I mean, how amazing is that?! In my case, it was a Nigerian father, and he spoke broken English, which I didn’t realise until I was in my late 20s, and I interviewed him on tape and then I heard it back. I think somehow that has affected me as a writer, because I do like capturing the vernacular with my characters. And then Catholic church, where I went every Sunday for 10 years of my life. Torture! But I was absorbing the rich, poetic language of the Bible. When I started writing, it came out as poetry and I always thought it was some kind of miracle, but actually, it was rooted in the church. I also want to ask another question about voices … With your book, to me it’s obvious that you’re drawing on all these different women’s experiences and it is, in a sense, poly-vocal. So can you talk a bit about that? WS Yeah, definitely. I think it was sitting down and listening to all the women that came through my home, which felt like hundreds and hundreds. My mum is a big-time social butterfly so, from a young age, I was privy to these private conversations, which as I got older turned into these women talking to me directly, and nobody seemed to care about it being inappropriate, because I’m the eldest, so it was just like: “Oh, she can deal with it.” So I really heard about people’s private lives, people’s marital issues … I heard about the complications and consequences of female genital mutilation, things that people will not tell anybody else – especially from my culture. They knew that I was interested in writing and it was like: “Oh yeah, she’s gonna be a writer, so let’s tell her all our stories.” It was really, really sweet how they championed me, and I just wanted to honour that. BE Sometimes I draw on people I’ve known, and I’m always really entertained [to discover] the people who don’t read my books, because I know that they might recognise themselves, but they don’t read the books! So I can say what I like! WS Has anybody ever come to you and said please stop writing about me? BE Oh yeah, I’ve been heckled! One of my characters was kind of inspired by somebody I used to know and they came to an event and started shouting out, having a go at me. And it was a really smart, prestigious event! That was the worst. But, as writers, I think we are ruthless, to a certain extent. Y’know, if you’re not somehow drawing on the people around you, then what are you going to draw on? I’ve just published a memoir [Manifesto: On Never Giving Up] and I really worked hard to disguise people. I had to stay true to the experience I had with them, but somehow obscure their identity. So, like, somebody might, for example, be living in America, but I maybe put them in the north of England. WS Witness protection! You have to witness-protect your exes! There are some family members of mine that I just won’t touch, because I know that they’ll hunt me down. BE Another thing that’s interesting about your process, I remember you telling me that you write while watching television? We know writers talk about their noise-cancelling headphones, and no distractions and so on, and here you are; I think you said you wrote in bed, watching television? WS Yeah! These are the places that I write: I write in the cinema, in the loudest coffee shop in the world. I used to really love writing in Ikea, because it’s so loud. I love when children are screaming, so now that I have kids, it’s really inspiring! The more noise, the better! It’s because I was parent-ified from a young age and had to look after my sisters. I just had to get on with it. If I was gonna write, I was gonna have to write in the middle of three screaming children, in the middle of cooking and cleaning and doing my schoolwork and finding a little boyfriend in the street and hanging out with my friends. And I needed to do everything. I knew that I had all this responsibility, but I knew that I also wanted to be young while I was young, because I could see in my mother the repercussions of giving up your youth, and how it catches up with you later. So I was gung-ho about having all the experiences. BE That’s really inspirational for aspiring writers, because the myth is that you need to have your own desk in a quiet room. And that’s not going to work for everybody! I grew up in a large family with eight kids, so it was a noisy household, but as a middle child, I didn’t have to take responsibility for anybody except for myself. I would retreat into reading books. I didn’t have a room of my own until I left home when I was 18. So it’s a class thing as well, isn’t it? Now, I want to move on to America. You abandoned us! You eloped with the Mexican guy. Explain yourself! WS Maaaan … OK, so let me speak honestly: I think that sometimes you’re faced with this decision to either take care of those that you’ve taken care of your whole entire life, and sacrifice your life, in a way. Or you can make a choice – which is what I did – to, for the first time ever, put myself first. That was really hard. And also, y’know, I fell in love! I needed to know whether or not this was going to work. I didn’t want to look back on my life later and feel resentment towards my sisters. I didn’t want to feel like Miss Havisham, up in the attic, and be like: “I gave up everything for you guys!” I want them to have these amazing, bright, vibrant, fulfilled lives, but if I stayed I’d be resentful. I knew that could happen to me very easily because it’s happened to women in my family over and over again. Then what happened was that Trump became president shortly after I moved, and then there was the whole “Muslim ban” thing, and then the pandemic … So back-to-back stuff has happened, which meant I couldn’t travel. Although it seems like I didn’t want to come back, I really have missed London so much. BE And then, Beyoncé! WS So the Beyoncé thing happened very randomly, honestly. I opened up my email and there was one from Parkwood, which is Beyoncé’s company. I thought somebody was pranking me, but it turned out to be actually them. They thought I was in London, and I said: “Actually, coincidentally, I happen to be in LA right now … ” So it all happened very quickly. I woke up that morning, and that afternoon, I was sitting with Beyoncé listening to the album [Lemonade]. I grew up listening to Destiny’s Child and Beyoncé, so it was very surreal. I was very starstruck. I thought, finally, the mental health issue that my mum has always talked about on my dad’s side of the family had kicked in, and what a beautiful psychosis this is! Of all the ways to lose my mind, this is a great one. And then it turned out to be real. It was a really beautiful experience, in that she made me feel just safe and special. She was very, very kind to me and she’s really sweet – she sent me flowers after the births of both my children – but yeah, then I just went back to writing. I don’t really think about it much. BE That’s because you’re so grounded. It hasn’t gone to your head. But I think it’s testament to your work, that she chose you, out of all the poets around. You write with such empathy and compassion that your work transcends these perceived barriers and boundaries around women’s experiences. You write beautifully about loss and displacement, the bond between women, and these are all things that women around the world can relate to. I think this book will have incredible global reach. Your work is not depressing; even though you are tackling some really serious subjects, it’s uplifting. I think that’s a really special skill. WS Thank you! It means so much coming from you, you don’t even know. The conversation turns to Shire’s 2009 poem Home, which became a viral sensation around 2015, when Benedict Cumberbatch recited lines from it as part of a charity fundraising single in response to the Syrian refugee crisis: “No one leaves home unless / home is the mouth of a shark.” WS I remember when I wrote that poem, it came from visiting Italy and meeting some Somali refugees who lived in the old, abandoned Somali embassy there. There was no electricity, no running water and a young man had, the night before, jumped to his death from the top of the building. I was seeing first-hand, and hearing straight from the people who were experiencing it, how difficult it was to be a refugee or an immigrant. So that poem came out of that. I think it was André 3000 that said: “Across cultures, darker people suffer the most, why?” And so I think it’s really great, obviously, that this poem has spread far and wide, but it’s not lost on me that it only started to get traction when the refugees in question had lighter skin from those that I was speaking about to begin with. That said, obviously, the best thing that could happen is that your work is used, not only to raise awareness, but to raise funds. I get contacted by synagogues and churches all over the world [wanting to do that]. I do think it’s really odd, that it takes all that for people to understand how hard it is to be a fucking refugee! You have to really, really drum it in! And although it’s a beautiful thing that everybody can come together to connect with these words, and have more empathy, the downside of it is that whenever I see it’s being shared, I know it’s because something really horrible has happened, like all these people have just drowned. BE Obviously, that poem is so powerful and so quotable, but I think a lot of your poetry is quotable, actually. I think that’s one of its strengths. It’s complex and multi-layered, and can take rereading, but at the same time its reach is beyond poetry readers. WS People say quite a bit: “I don’t really like poetry, but I like your work.” I, personally, really love poems that are difficult to get into and take time to understand. I think, though, maybe what’s making it accessible to those who aren’t that interested in poetry is that I’ve always felt like I’m a writer who’s not very academic, not very intellectual. When I hear other writers speak, I would feel like: “Oh, OK, I must be a hoodrat, because I can’t speak that way!” So maybe some of that goes into it. I don’t know. I think class has always been something I’ve been very aware of and, at times, has made me feel like an impostor, because I don’t sound like how I imagined a writer would sound. BE I want to pick you up on this idea that you’re not intellectual, Warsan, because you are! But we’re brainwashed in this society to think that unless you were privately educated and went to Oxford and draw on certain literary or cultural references, then you are less sophisticated, less intelligent, less cultured than those who have gone through that system. I have had that. I don’t have it any more because I do what I do and that’s it; I am myself. You are most definitely yourself, and the way you write, your process, your cultural references are valid and true to who you are, and that’s the most important thing that we can be as writers. Your communication is incredibly effective. WS Oh, thank you. You gave me a therapy session there! I really appreciate it. You’ve worked really hard to create space in publishing and literature for Black and non-white writers. I know you’ve done so much to make it possible for our voices to be heard. How does it feel to see the needle move just a little tiny bit? BE Y’know the needle has shifted quite a lot, actually. Right now, it’s quite … I don’t want to use the word “fashionable”, but certainly I think publishers want to have diverse lists now and before they didn’t care. Now there are so many new writers coming through I’ve lost track, whereas before I knew literally everybody. So it feels really good. But what I’m really interested in, at this stage, is that people should have long careers. I don’t want us to find that in 10 years’ time, there are only, like, three writers remaining, continuing to publish … What is the scene like over there? Are you reading American writers? WS No, to be honest I haven’t stayed on top of it … The last book I read was The Republic of Motherhood by Liz Berry and then before that it was Jay Bernard’s Surge. I still drink PG Tips. I watch Gogglebox, I still watch EastEnders. I have started a deep love affair with Karl Pilkington, who I listen to every single night before I go to sleep. It’s really important for me to remember where I come from, y’know? My nightmare is to get an American accent. BE Which you haven’t got, so that’s OK. WS No, listen, I don’t speak to Americans! The only American I speak to is the one I’m married to. BE And Beyoncé! WS Oh yeah, and Beyoncé.

2/26/2022,"From Vladimir Putin’s former son-in-law to the chairman of Russia’s second largest bank, more than 100 individuals and entities have been added to the UK sanctions list, in what Boris Johnson has billed as the “largest ever” set of financial measures against Moscow, designed to “squeeze Russia from the global economy”. The foreign secretary has promised that a further 570 names – elected politicians from the Duma and the Federation Council – will soon be added to the list. While many anticipated the latest measures, the scale and complexity of what is being enacted will prove a legal minefield for British nationals or companies that have done business or had any kind of relationship with those now blacklisted. So how will the restrictions imposed on oligarchs and other individuals work in practice? First, any assets owned by those individuals and companies named are frozen. This does not result in a change of ownership, so the house, bank account, private jet, or yacht is not seized. Second, those on the list are banned from all UK transactions. British businesses and UK nationals are not permitted to make funds available to these individuals or accept funds from them. Taking the example of a property owned by a person on the sanctions list, the person would not be able to rent it out, mortgage it, or sell it. While the sanctions would not prevent someone from flying on their private jet, the accompanying travel ban would prevent them from going anywhere. In addition, sanctions would prevent the jet’s owner from paying for fuel or crew. Even if they were not using their plane to generate cash, the sanctions are designed to make it difficult for the owner to maintain and operate it. “They can’t deal with their own asset in the way they otherwise might choose to,” says Alexandra Melia, partner at law firm Steptoe & Johnson. “They can’t gain access to benefits it would otherwise give them.” Restrictions also apply to any business belonging to a sanctioned person, putting the onus on firms to look at their customer and supplier base, to ensure they know who the ultimate owners of those companies are. The measures restrict “economic resources”, says Stacy Keen a senior associate at law firm Pinsent Masons. “This is essentially any assets of any kind that can be used to generate funds, and this includes individuals and businesses. “If a business is on that list, you cannot provide them with any services that they can then use to generate funds. That could be provision of products that those businesses will use to manufacture another product and sell into the marketplace.” Sanctions could mean bad news for British private schools, long favoured by wealthy Russian families. The government has said relatives will not be added to the list, but if the fees are paid by a sanctioned person, that money cannot be accepted. However, if a house or jet needs to be maintained or repaired, it is possible to apply to the sanctions watchdog, the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI), which operates as a division of the Treasury, for permission to undertake the work. Sanctions are subject to a “licence regime”, meaning those on the list can submit an application for a licence. This would give them written permission to carry out an act that would otherwise be in breach of the sanctions against them. Essential spending is one of the reasons permitted by OFSI, although Melia says the grounds for a licence are “pretty limited, purposely so, to preserve the effect of the measures”. Anyone requesting a licence from OFSI is required to make clear what they are requesting – including exact amounts of money and payment routes – as well as the legal basis for the request, and the urgency of the application. It’s unclear whether private school fees for a sanctioned person’s children would be considered essential spending. Alongside frozen assets, sanctioned individuals who own shares would not be permitted to receive dividends from those investments. In practical terms, any dividend payments would be frozen and would remain sitting in a bank account, but could not be accessed. The same would apply for interest accrued in a bank account. There has been speculation over what could happen to two of the UK’s largest football clubs, which have links to wealthy and prominent Russians, in the event of the extension of sanctions. Chelsea FC is owned by billionaire Roman Abramovich, while Everton has close ties to Alisher Usmanov. Both men have rejected any suggestion that they or their businesses could be targeted. Should that change, sanctions experts say the clubs could be run by a separate management board, which would allow them to continue operating, while any profits would be held in a kind of distinct bank account. In the past, such arrangements were made to allow the state-owned National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) to continue trading, even while it was under US sanctions, and where payments for oil were placed in an escrow account in a different country. Some of the other measures announced by the UK government, which are expected to be brought into secondary legislation on Tuesday, are more wide-ranging. Johnson said the government would limit to £50,000 the amount of money which any Russian national – not just those named on the sanctions list – could deposit in a UK bank account. Sanctions experts say banks will have been stepping up their monitoring of customers with links to Russia, and looking at patterns of payments. These monitoring systems would raise an alert if anyone was trying to avoid restrictions, such as by making regular, smaller deposits. One thing is certain. The OFSI, which has issued only six fines for breaches of the rules since it was established in 2016, is going to have a much wider field to police.",News/Business,Frozen out: how the UK’s sanctions against Russia will work,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/26/frozen-out-how-the-uks-sanctions-against-russia-will-work
