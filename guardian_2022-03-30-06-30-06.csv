3/30/2022,"British toddlers are increasingly likely to be users of TikTok, with a substantial number of parents saying their preschool children use the video service despite the app supposedly being restricted to those aged 13 and older. About 16% of three- and four-year-olds view TikTok content, according to research commissioned by media regulator Ofcom. This rises to a third of all children in the five- to seven-year-old age group. TikTok’s terms of service excludes under-13s and its moderators have instructions to look out for content produced by younger users and to block their accounts. However, the research suggests the age checks on new users are being widely flouted. The reality that young children – often aided by parents creating profiles or sharing their mobile phone – are accessing TikTok could cause regulatory headaches for the company. Its powerful recommendation algorithm has helped it grow into one of the most powerful media platforms in the world, but it is undergoing the same growing pains that have affected platforms such as Facebook and YouTube, with concerns about content covering topics such as eating disorders and adult material. Since it began being enforced last year, the UK’s age-appropriate design code has required British apps and websites with large numbers of child users to pay particular attention to the personal data they are gathering on young users and to provide a higher level of privacy by default. But the code has no specific restrictions for very young children. A TikTok spokesperson said: “Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our community, especially young people. TikTok is strictly a 13-plus platform and we have processes in place to enforce our minimum age requirements, both at the point of sign up and through the continuous proactive removal of suspected underage accounts from the platform.” Ofcom’s annual survey of the nation’s media habits also suggested the growing popularity of short-form content could be linked to multiscreening, with more children reporting difficulties in focusing on a single online activity. Children reported being unable to watch films, or other long-form content, without being on multiple devices at the same time. Only 4% of children aged three to 17 said they never do anything else while watching television. The number of British households without access to the internet has remained at about 1.7m – equivalent to 6% of British homes. The vast majority in this category are older people or those on the lowest incomes, with most saying they have no plans to go online in the next year – even though that increasingly leaves them cut off from many services and forms of communication. There are also signs that Britons are less tolerant of online anonymity and more concerned that something they posted online could come back to haunt them later in life. Ofcom found that 55% of Britons now disagree with the idea that people should be able to say whatever they want online, even if hurtful or controversial, up from 47% in 2020.",News/Technology,"TikTok being used by 16% of British toddlers, Ofcom finds",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/29/tiktok-being-used-by-16-of-british-toddlers-ofcom-finds
3/30/2022,"In photographs released from the Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul on Tuesday, one face stood out, smiling as the negotiations got under way. Sanctioned billionaire Roman Abramovich is not officially part of the Russian delegation, but has apparently played a major role behind the scenes, jetting between Moscow, Kyiv and Istanbul since Russia invaded Ukraine. Further questions about what role Abramovich was playing, and why, were raised on Monday, when the Wall Street Journal and investigative outlet Bellingcat claimed Abramovich and a Ukrainian MP were among three people to fall ill with symptoms consistent with chemical poisoning, during a round of negotiations in Kyiv in early March. A source confirmed to the Guardian that Abramovich had fallen ill after the meeting, and had lost his sight for several hours. He soon recovered and was able to take part in later rounds of negotiations. News of the alleged poisoning has been met with widespread scepticism. In a rare case of Washington and Moscow agreeing on something during the past month, both capitals have given signals they do not believe the poisoning story. “The intelligence highly suggests this was environmental,” a US official told Reuters on Monday, adding: “Eg, not poisoning.” On Tuesday, Dmitry Peskov, Russian president Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, added his own denial: “This is part of the information panic, part of the information sabotage, information war. These reports are not true … it is necessary to strongly filter the flow of information.” A spokesperson for the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, meanwhile, cautioned “only to follow official information”. Christo Grozev, of Bellingcat, said he stood by the claims. “We don’t know who did it but something did happen,” he said. Grozev has a record of uncovering poisoning attempts, including identifying the Russian hit squad that allegedly poisoned Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny in 2020. He said he would soon be able to release more information about the current incident. “We are trying to find a balance between protecting privacy and security concerns of the individuals and informing the public correctly,” Grozev said. Aside from the poisoning claims, the emergence of the publicity-shy oligarch at the heart of peace negotiations has also surprised many. In recent years, Abramovich has positioned himself as someone who has retired from the hard edge of business life and has no political ambitions. He has been known for funding cultural causes and generally living the high life. Although he can sometimes be spotted in Moscow art galleries, theatres or restaurants, the former Chelsea football club owner loathes publicity, and gives no interviews. Information about Abramovich’s wealth and lifestyle have instead tended to come from court cases, notably an epic 2012 battle in the London courts with his former benefactor Boris Berezovsky, who claimed Abramovich had swindled him out of several billion dollars by forcing him to sell his stake in oil company Sibneft at a reduced price. The judge found in Abramovich’s favour. More recently, Abramovich brought a libel case in London against journalist Catherine Belton, after contesting several claims in Belton’s book Putin’s People, including that he bought Chelsea at Putin’s request. Abramovich settled with Belton after her publisher agreed the book would acknowledge this was not a statement of fact. In that court case, his lawyers claimed “Abramovich is someone who is distant from Putin”, something which has been thrown into question by his sudden appearance as an envoy. A source in the Ukrainian delegation told news outlet Ukrayinska Pravda that Abramovich had positioned himself as a neutral intermediary, and his main role was “to pass on our position to their boss in human language”. Alexander Rodnyansky, an economic adviser to Zelenskiy, told the Guardian that Abramovich had been brought in as an intermediary by his father, a Ukrainian film producer who knows the billionaire well. In Kyiv, Abramovich is seen as, at the very least, a serious interlocutor who has Putin’s ear. Russia’s official negotiating team is mostly made up of second-tier officials not seen as influential, so Putin may have selected Abramovich as a more serious interlocutor to send to the Ukrainians. “Putin is looking for back channels. He doesn’t believe in anything that’s open. Everything should be a little bit conspiratorial,” said veteran Russian journalist Yevgenia Albats. A source in Moscow said Abramovich had been granted two personal meetings with Zelenskiy in Kyiv over the past month, claims which have not been confirmed by the Ukrainian side. After the visit during which Abramovich fell ill, he returned again for another trip to the Ukrainian capital, said the source. Zelenskiy, in his interview with Russian journalists over the weekend, said Abramovich was one of a number of Russian oligarchs who had contacted him offering to invest in the Ukrainian economy. “We got signals from him and from several other businessmen saying ‘let us help somehow, let us try to do something,’” said Zelenskiy. He also said Abramovich had been involved in unsuccessful discussions to organise humanitarian corridors. However, he did not mention Abramovich’s visits to Kyiv, or his own purported meetings with the oligarch. Albats said offers from Abramovich and other Russian businessmen to help Ukraine could come from horror at the war, but also self-interest and a desire to avoid crippling western sanctions. “It’s the way people are trying to save their villas, yachts and also to be on the right side of the struggle. Some of them at least are horrified. I know some who just couldn’t believe what happened,” said Albats. “Then there are some who are just concerned they’re unable to pay their cleaning ladies.” Many are sceptical about Abramovich’s reincarnation as peacemaker. “How could they have forgotten who this is? He is one of the biggest sponsors of Putin’s regime,” said Maria Pevchikh, a close associate of jailed opposition leader Navalny and the head of investigations for his Anti-Corruption Foundation. Pevchikh said she did not buy the idea that Abramovich could be an independent actor in the talks. “I’m 100% sure that this was coordinated with the Kremlin entirely. When you’ve been Putin’s puppet for 22 years you don’t suddenly go rogue,” she said.",News/World news,Why is Abramovich playing peacemaker after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/why-is-abramovich-playing-peacemaker-after-russias-invasion-of-ukraine
3/30/2022,"Leading black figures in the Church of England including two prominent bishops are among more than 160 signatories to a letter objecting to a recent judgment that a memorial to the slave trader Tobias Rustat should remain in the chapel at Jesus College, Cambridge. The letter to the Church Times, which is also signed by the former archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams, warns the judgment could have far-reaching consequences for the Church of England, leading to a loss of respect and questions about the church’s authority and leadership. “We write with disappointment at the recent decision to retain the Rustat memorial in the chapel at Jesus College, Cambridge, and grave concern for what this will mean for the Church of England,” it says. “It is our firm hope that an appeal will be possible, and that the result of the appeal will be the relocation of the memorial from the chapel to a suitable site within Jesus College.” Other signatories include: the Bishop of Willesden, Lusa Nsenga-Ngoy; the Bishop of Woolwich, Dr Karowei Dorgu; the church’s former race adviser Dr Elizabeth Henry; the Dean of Manchester, Rogers Govender; and the Archdeacon of Croydon, Rosemarie Mallett. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has already expressed his support for the memorial to be removed. Jesus College applied to the Diocese of Ely to move the memorial to its 17th-century benefactor from its prominent position in the Grade I listed chapel to another site in the college because its presence was having a negative impact on the mission and ministry of the church. Rustat, a former courtier to King Charles II and one of the college’s most significant benefactors, was involved with the Royal Adventurers and the Royal African Company that trafficked and traded enslaved Africans. Last week a church court ruled that widespread opposition to the memorial was based on “a false narrative” about the scale of the financial rewards Rustat gained from slavery, and it ordered that the memorial should remain in the chapel. The Church Times letter, which has been widely shared on Twitter, warned that the continued presence of the memorial would “lead people within and beyond Christianity, and within and beyond the college’s membership, to distrust, reject, and lose respect for the Church of England. “This case raises real questions about authority and leadership in the Church of England, and this judgment may have far-reaching consequences.” The letter said that a recent report, From Lament to Action, commissioned by the Church of England’s General Synod, stated that in order for the church to be a credible voice in calling for change across the world “we must now ensure that apologies and lament are accompanied by swift actions leading to real change”. “If memorials to the likes of Rustat will not be removed or repositioned, will any?” it said. Jesus College has said it is considering whether to seek leave to appeal.",News/UK news,More than 160,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/29/church-of-england-leaders-object-to-keeping-slave-trader-memorial-in-college
3/30/2022,"Boris Johnson faced a renewed threat to his position over the partygate scandal after the police decision to fine 20 people for lockdown breaches appeared to shatter his claim that Covid rules were followed in No 10. The move by the Metropolitan police was seen as clearcut confirmation of lawbreaking at the heart of government, yet Downing Street provoked fury and derision by refusing to accept the fixed-penalty notices meant the rules had definitively been broken. On a febrile day, No 10 was also forced to back down after initially saying it would not disclose if Simon Case, the cabinet secretary and civil service head, was one of those issued with a fixed-penalty notice. With the Met making clear this was only the first tranche of referrals – and interviews with certain key figures likely to take place in the coming weeks – there is still a possibility Johnson will be among those asked to pay a fixed-penalty notice. The threat by some Tory MPs to depose him has lessened in recent weeks amid the crisis in Ukraine, but confirmation of the first penalties on Tuesday reignited talk of a possible challenge. Rebel Tory MPs who previously organised against Johnson said they would now renew efforts to convince colleagues that the prime minister had lied to parliament. “They’re the first proof that laws were broken, despite denials,” one said. Another rebel said that while the number of open malcontents remained low, if Johnson was to be fined, the threat of a no-confidence vote against the prime minister could resurface: “We’re perfectly capable of returning to address this issue when it finally concludes.” Johnson was attempting to shore up his leadership on Tuesday night with a dinner for Tory MPs, but a number declined to attend. Ministers who attended were heckled by bereaved families of Covid victims as they arrived. Shouts of “shame on you” and “off to another party are we?” were directed at Michael Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg as they turned up to the Park Plaza near Westminster Bridge, where a penthouse costs up to £653 a night. In a sign of Johnson’s already diminished authority, Conservative whips U-turned on Tuesday and opted to not force Tory MPs to vote against a Labour motion seeking access to the security advice over the decision to give a peerage to Evgeny Lebedev. The Labour motion had been expected to fail, as ministers opposed the release and wanted Tory MPs to oppose it. But they were forced to back down when a group of backbenchers threatened to rebel. Johnson will also face a critical moment in his premiership if he is revealed to be among those who are included in subsequent tranches of fixed-penalty notices. Senior Tory MPs such as the former attorney general, Jeremy Wright, have said he should face “resignation or removal from office” if he is found to have knowingly attended rule-breaking parties. And former lord chancellor, Robert Buckland, said on Tuesday: “I think any head of government who has been found to have infringed the law has got some explaining to do.” Those who moved against Johnson in February do not yet believe there is enough pressure on him to instigate a fresh challenge to his leadership, and the fact that none of those fined will be named is also seen as likely to limit the scale of the damage. But some MPs said they were reserving their judgment until the full report on the parties by senior civil servant Sue Gray is released, which will not happen until the police investigation is over. Others said Johnson being fined or not would be the crucial factor. “It’s really tricky for him,” said one backbencher who has not previously sought the prime minister’s departure. “The case remains that we are on very shaky ground if our leaders break the rules that they make.” However, a former cabinet minister added: “The rebels are often people who don’t like him for other reasons. They have been let down by him personally. It’s venal, but it’s true. And there is a lot of wishful thinking. So I think he’s out of the woods for the moment and the real question is when we return to normal politics [after Ukraine] because the moment we do, the risk goes up again. The conventional wisdom is that if he survives the year, then he survives until the election.” As Tory MPs weighed Johnson’s future, Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, renewed calls for Johnson to resign: “The buck stops with the prime minister, who spent months lying to the British public, which is why he has got to go.” No 10 said on Tuesday that it did not know the identities of the 20 people set to be given fixed-penalty notices, and that they would not need to inform superiors unless it formed part of a security vetting procedure. They could still face disciplinary action as part of Gray’s inquiry. The only people who will be named if fined are Johnson, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, who is also among those who filled in a police questionnaire about the alleged gatherings, and Case. Under pressure for a lack of transparency, Downing Street changed tack over naming Case, saying this should happen “given his unique position”. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said anonymity was not tenable if senior staff were fined: “It must be the case that any decision-maker and senior official who is handed a fixed-penalty notice for attending a party must have their name published.” The Met has said those who are issued notices will not be named, based on the professional practice guidance for fixed-penalty notices. The force said there was a “significant amount of investigative material that remains to be assessed” and that further penalties would be issued if the evidence threshold was met. The police have also said they will not set out which penalties were issued for which alleged gatherings to avoid inadvertent identification, raising the possibility that the public might never learn if events attended by Johnson were in breach of the law. Police are investigating 12 events in 2020 and 2021, six of which Johnson is said to have attended. Johnson’s spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister now accepted the law was broken on his watch: “It’s for the Met to make that judgment rather than the prime minister. You will hear more from the prime minister once the report has concluded.” Johnson was not expected to comment on the matter until the end of the police investigation, and the subsequent publication of the second part of the report by Gray, the spokesperson added. Those given fixed-penalty notices will receive a letter from the criminal records office, Acro, giving 28 days to pay the penalty. It is thought at this stage that the Met is probably referring people for penalties of £100 or £200.",News/Politics,Partygate: new threat to Boris Johnson’s leadership as Met fines 20 over scandal,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/29/partygate-new-threat-to-boris-johnsons-leadership-as-met-fines-20-over-scandal
3/30/2022,"In the end, it really should have surprised no one that Graham Arnold constructed his own reality in the build-up to the Socceroos 1-0 loss to Saudi Arabia. “I’ve been around the national team now for 40 years and I’ve never known a game to be a dead rubber,” he declared. “It’s more about going out against this team that’s qualified for a World Cup and showing our worth, and giving an opportunity for these players to step up and for them to push for a position in the playoff squad.” Yet despite any contortions in logic to argue otherwise, a dead rubber is exactly what this match was. A 2-0 defeat against Japan the previous week meant that, no matter the result in Jeddah, the Socceroos knew the fate of their qualification campaign now lay in the playoff path. Meanwhile, the Green Falcons were safe in the knowledge that their ticket to Qatar 2022 – as symbolised by the large jumbo jet tifo erected in the stands – was already punched. And while the Socceroos had their moments – able to play as the reactive team to fashion threatening chances in transition, including an incredibly tight offside call that disallowed a Martin Boyle goal – Salem Al-Dawsari’s 65th-minute penalty ensured that it would be the hosts who took a comfortable win and first place in Group B. Australia has now won just one of their last seven World Cup qualifiers; a tailspin in form that both probably should have been seen coming and will now force them to secure a fifth-straight World Cup apparence the hard way. Ostensibly, dead rubbers such as Wednesday remove the risks associated with what would otherwise be a competitive fixture. They are an opportunity, as Arnold said, to blood younger or more inexperienced talent against a higher quality opposition, experiment with new tactics and strategies, or, perhaps, salvage some kind of pride for when a collective campaign is consigned to the annals of history. And Arnold, good as his word, demonstrated the first quality in both his starting XI on Wednesday and the in-game substitutions that were made. 22-year-old Hearts defender Nathaniel Atkinson was handed an international debut at right back, 23-year-old Gianni Stensness started his second international cap at centre back after previously starting as a six against Japan, 22-year-old Denis Genreau, after mystifyingly failing to see a single minute in the third-phase of AFC World Cup qualification, lined up in the Australian midfield. 24-year-old striker Nicholas D’Agostino and 20-year-old attacker Marco Tilio were also introduced as second-half substitutes. With the likes of Tom Rogic, Aaron Mooy, Jackson Irvine, and more all likely to be available, if this youth brigade will see any kind of scope in a coming playoff against the United Arab Emirates and, if the Australia triumphs in that, a do-or-die clash with either Peru, Chile, or Colombia is unknown, but they likely will, or should, represent part of the core of the national team as it begins to prepare for the 2026 World Cup cycle (as low stakes as that now will be with the tournament extended to 48 teams). Of course, in the high-stakes world of international football, the future is never guaranteed. If one was to put much stock in speculative reports and innuendo back in Australia, Wednesday’s game was not only a dead rubber in a qualification capacity, but also for Arnold’s own tenure as Socceroos boss; the axe supposedly set to fall on the 58-year-old’s second tenure as national team boss regardless of the result in the Gulf. In the fine tradition of coaches under the cosh, Arnold had played down the speculation in the lead into the game and, with the post-game press conferences only open to those at the ground, was spared questioning by a local press pack that has grabbed its brushes and begun to place the writing on the wall of his tenure. Nonetheless, in the wake of the defeat, the eyes of Australian football will now inevitably turn to Football Australia in coming days, speculating on the moment if/when black smoke will emerge from the federation’s metaphorical chimney at its Barangaroo office.",Sport/Football,Pressure builds on Graham Arnold as Socceroos slump to Saudi Arabia defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/30/pressure-builds-on-graham-arnold-as-socceroos-slump-to-saudi-arabia-defeat
3/30/2022,"It was a night when Gareth Southgate shuffled his pack extensively and asked whether a number of players on the fringes of his England team could cope with the weight of the shirt. By full time, with Ivory Coast demoralised and dismantled, the manager had an emphatic answer. From first to last, this was a procession, the visitors seemingly wanting to be elsewhere – ideally the playoffs for Africa’s five World Cup spots which were going on without them. The Elephants had said goodbye when they finished second to Cameroon at the group phase of qualification. Their captain, Serge Aurier, gave England a helping hand when he was sent off in the 40th minute for a second yellow card, which appeared to be for dissent. It was such a strange moment, out of keeping with the tone of the friendly, and it sounded the death knell for it as a contest. England had been much the better team before then, Ollie Watkins outlining his intention to be Harry Kane’s understudy with the opening goal and a polished all-around performance and Jude Bellingham reinforcing once again that he is a midfielder of the highest promise. And they were able to coast thereafter. Raheem Sterling made it 2-0 before the interval, teed up beautifully by Jack Grealish – who enjoyed himself, all strutting confidence on the ball – and there was an inevitability about the second half being one of those where, broadly, the players went through the motions. England have never lost to an African team. That was never going to change here. The result came hard on the heels of Saturday’s 2-1 Wembley win over Switzerland and Tyrone Mings would set the seal on it with a stoppage-time header from a corner from the substitute, Phil Foden. Southgate was always going to make wholesale changes from the Switzerland game, partly because of the need to manage the players’ workloads at this stage of the season and also to show that he trusts those who are best described as understudies. It feels as though his idea is to play 3-4-3 at the World Cup, especially against the stronger opponents, but tactical flexibility or having a Plan B remains important. The manager had finished with his side in a 4-3-3 against the Swiss and he started here with the same system, one of the interesting details being that Ben White continued at right-back, having been moved there for the final half-hour on Saturday. With Declan Rice sitting in front of the back four, England pressed high, with Bellingham, in particular, a driving force who also offered an option in the final third. Ivory Coast could not cope before the interval and it was difficult to remember them crossing halfway. The die felt cast even before Aurier’s dismissal. Grealish was eye-catching, enjoying plenty of room off the left and making his moves, including one lovely shoulder drop that froze Jean Michaël Seri, but it was Bellingham who went the closest in the opening quarter, playing a slick give-and-go with Sterling inside the area before seeing his shot flick off Badra Ali Sangaré and come back off the post. On the rebound, when the ball was fizzed across the face of goal, Watkins stretched but could not apply a touch. The breakthrough had been advertised and when it came, it was all about the persistence and quick footwork of Sterling. Wearing the captain’s armband with Kane rested, Sterling chased a Grealish pass up the inside left channel only for Eric Bailly to cut it out and prod clear. No matter. Sterling hoovered up the loose ball and ran at Aurier, unnerving him, before crossing low for Watkins, who had a tap-in. Aurier’s attempt at a challenge was poor while Bailly allowed the cross to go through his legs. Things would go from bad to worse for the visitors. Aurier had been booked for a cheap foul on Grealish in the 32nd minute, pulling him back after losing the ball to him. He would feel the blood surge to his head shortly afterwards. Aurier went into a challenge with Watkins, went to ground and argued strongly for a foul, even though it was nothing of the sort. There was confusion when the referee, Erik Lambrechts, gave him a second yellow card, with even Grealish appearing to argue against it. England had a glut of chances before half-time, with Grealish, Sterling, Rice and Bellingham again going close. Sterling’s goal followed a nice touch and layoff by Watkins. Sterling burst through to shoot and, when Sangaré pushed the ball up and away, Grealish played a lovely first-time square ball back to him. Sterling swept home. It was possible to wonder whether Lambrechts had not realised, in the heat of the moment with Aurier, whether he had already booked him. A second yellow card in a friendly for dissent? Was it truly necessary? That said, Aurier’s furious reaction had put him on dangerous ground. The referee got himself into a tangle at the start of the second half, pointing to the penalty spot after the Ivory Coast substitute, Fousseny Coulibaly, had lunged into a tackle on Bellingham after yet another incisive England move involving Sterling and Grealish. VAR, though, would advise a rethink, with the replays showing that Coulibaly had touched the ball. Lambrechts made the overrule with trademark theatre. The Ivorians’ misery was summed up when Simon Deli lifted their only chance over the bar from close range following a free-kick. It was a horror miss. Mings would show him how at the very end with a thumping downwards header.",Sport/Football,Raheem Sterling leads England to easy victory over 10-man Ivory Coast,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/29/england-ivory-coast-international-friendly-match-report
3/30/2022,"Sexual intercourse began, of course, in 1963. And so, by absolutely no coincidence, did what would become the 30-year campaigning career of Mary Whitehouse. The Nuneaton art teacher-turned-scourge of the permissive society and moral decay the 60s had ushered in was at the peak of her fame and power during my childhood in the early 80s. I was already surrounded by northern matriarchs of unswerving personal convictions, so it seemed to me that one more added to the mix could make no difference. Whitehouse, however, did. Not to the children who came within clouting/educational range like my militant lineup of local battleaxes (although I suspect she could deliver a clip round the ear with the best of them) but to the nation. The two-part, two-hour documentary Banned! The Mary Whitehouse Story (BBC Two) is an exhaustive – and slightly exhausting – look at how and why she engaged in her long and impassioned struggle against Britain’s decline and what its effects, intended and unintended, were. She gunned first for the BBC, then under the aegis of – in the eyes of Whitehouse and her evangelical Moral Re-Armament coevals – “the devil incarnate” Sir Hugh Greene. She harnessed the then considerable might of the many women’s and Christian groups around the country, petitioned parliament and got the voices of the non-metropolitan and non-elite heard. When she formed them into the National Viewers’ and Listeners’ Association and appointed herself head of it, she became a true thorn in Greene’s side. After his experiences in the war, he saw the BBC and a progressive agenda as a path to mass enlightenment and a way of inoculating the world, or his little part of it, against a repeat of the horrors he had witnessed. But one of the broadcaster’s responses to the NVLA’s concerns was to commission a “spiteful and malicious” drama – Swizzlewick – about her, which was nobody’s finest hour. The inclusion of such points is proof that – as you might hope, although not necessarily expect in these benighted times – the BBC has put its toys back in the pram since then. Sixty years on from the Whitehouse beginnings as the BBC botherer of botherers, it succeeds in making an even-handed, unmalicious documentary about her that is at pains to tease apart the issues with which she was concerned and intelligently evaluate them against her contemporary norms and ours now. Her religiosity made her, among other things, wildly homophobic. Her rigidity and certainty of her own rightness in all things made her give no quarter to art. If a film showed a backstreet abortion (as Ken Loach’s Up the Junction did as part of its compassionate depiction of myriad social ills) it was simply Bad and should be banned. No matter that most of the time she didn’t watch the material she was calling to have censored. “I have too much respect for my mind” was her usual response to those who suggested she should literally know what she was talking about. But she was, as Beatrix Campbell (and, more extensively in next week’s episode, Louise Penny) point out, prescient in other fields, particularly where children and women and their freedoms were concerned. She refused to call herself a feminist, but she quickly and instinctively foresaw that a porn (for men)-saturated culture could easily curtail women’s liberation rather than encourage it, and that the benefits of destabilising marriage and the family would most likely run faster in men’s direction than the other. To anyone used to spending (too much) time on social media, it is a deeply odd and almost spiritually refreshing experience to consume something that admits – in fact not only admits, but insists – that a person and her work were neither wholly good nor wholly bad and, moreover, that the one does not negate the other. In the second episode particularly, the idea that a brake on liberalism and progressivism can be as valuable and necessary as halting travel in the other direction too was taken out and examined at leisure and without the mockery I found myself expecting to find round the corner any minute. They did her proud, and it made me oddly proud of the BBC – which she would, one assumes, have hated. Very nicely done.",Arts/Television & radio,Banned!

3/30/2022,"Last week it was Gareth Bale who was the subject of great adulation, in these parts at least, but this was a night that belonged to his longstanding sidekick Wayne Hennessey. On a night when Hennessey became the third Welshman to reach 100 caps for his country, a youngster at the start of his career, Rubin Colwill, scored his first senior goal to cancel out Tomas Soucek’s opener for the Czech Republic. It was always going to be impossible for this friendly to live up to anything remotely close to the joyous scenes here six days ago, when Bale’s double put Wales within a game of a first World Cup since 1958, but while the concourses were empty by comparison, a lively draw was played at an engaging pace in front of a sparse crowd that departed with Friday’s draw in Qatar at the forefront of their minds. Robert Page made wholesale changes – Hennessey was the only player to keep his place from Thursday’s victory over Austria – but the system remained the same, Brennan Johnson and Rabbi Matondo playing either side of Colwill, the teenage forward who plays his club football here for Cardiff. Aaron Ramsey was omitted from the squad altogether and Ben Davies was absent after returning to Tottenham as a precaution but Bale was among those on the bench. Bale was never going to miss Hennessey’s special occasion. The pair have become best friends – as well as golf partners – since meeting on Wales Under-21s duty and both described their close relationship as a “bromance” in the buildup to this game. Before kick-off the 35-year-old Burnley goalkeeper was presented with a gold cap and a commemorative award pitchside by his childhood hero, Neville Southall. If the thought of Wales rousing after such a memorable night felt ambitious, this was probably the last trip Czech Republic wanted, days on from losing their World Cup playoff semi-final in Sweden. Hennessey’s first start for Wales came against the same opposition, across town at the Millennium Stadium in 2007, against a team spearheaded by Milan Baros and Jan Koller, and he made a smart save here before the visitors opened the scoring. Wales had Chris Mepham to thank for blocking Jan Kuchta’s shot after Ben Cabango slipped in defence, but on 32 minutes Hennessey’s hopes of a clean sheet vanished. Onrej Lingr was first to Jaroslav Zeleny’s cross and an alert Soucek smacked the loose ball home from near the penalty spot. Hennessey was the only player in the Wales starting lineup with a Premier League appearance to his name this season – Soucek’s 28 for West Ham put that number into context – but there were flashes of quality from Johnson and Sorba Thomas, both of whom have enjoyed outstanding campaigns in the Championship, for Nottingham Forest and Huddersfield Town respectively. Johnson created Wales’s first opening but pulled the ball back for Matondo when the former Cardiff youngster, who was left out of the Euro 2020 squad, was waiting in the six-yard box but his delivery was perfect as Wales levelled two minutes after Soucek smashed in. Johnson poured forward down the right flank, eased past Tomas Petrasek and cut the ball back for Colwill to sweep into the corner. Wales could have fallen behind again before the interval Michal Sadilek’s free-kick dropped on to the roof of Hennessey’s goal. Joe Morrell showed some neat touches on his return and his midfield partner Will Vaulks twice went close from distance, hitting a post in the first half and a stanchion in the second. Johnson, wearing No 9, was especially lively and sent a shot whistling wide on 54 minutes after gliding clear of Jakub Brabec and driving forward. Mepham glanced a header at goal from Thomas’s free-kick but Soucek hooked clear and Johnson went close again after an impromptu game of head tennis in the Czech Republic 18-yard box. Hennessey was withdrawn on the hour mark to a warm ovation and he handed the captain’s armband to Joe Rodon, who entered in place of Chris Gunter, who became a Wales centurion himself last March. A visibly emotional Hennessey departed and made his way along the home dugout, shaking hands with backroom staff and substitutes. At the end of a long line, a smiling Bale waited to give him a bear hug. The talk beforehand was that it would make sense for Bale, who has played more minutes for Wales since August than Real Madrid, to join Hennessey on the pitch for the final throes but he arrived from the bench for the last minutes after the goalkeeper had departed. Bale, from an awkward angle, forced a fine save from the substitute goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik with two minutes of normal time remaining but he already has more than enough credit in the bank.",Sport/Football,Colwill seals draw for Wales after Soucek strikes for Czech Republic,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/29/wales-czech-republic-international-friendly-match-report
