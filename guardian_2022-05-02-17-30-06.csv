5/2/2022,"The residence of one of Australia’s most iconic TV duos, Kath & Kim, is being demolished. Construction company Dig Dig Demolition confirmed to Guardian Australia that workers began knocking down the two-storey house in south-east Melbourne on Monday. Images and videos shot from inside the house show wood and debris strewn across the living room and roof tiles and bricks piled up in the back yard. The four-bedroom house – located in the fictional suburb of Fountain Lakes on the show, but which actually sits at 4 Lagoon Place, Patterson Lakes – was made famous by the hit sitcom. It's Noice, Different, Unusual... And It's Being Demolished!The Kath & Kim house is set to be torn down, with tradies cracking on with important demolition projects of theirs from today.Reporter @brendancrew takes us through the spunky set for one last time. Full story @ 5pm. pic.twitter.com/Jxncqy1i5Y It was last sold in November 2016 for $1.48m. The series aired between 2002 and 2007 on ABC and Channel 7, and gained popularity in Australia – receiving three Logie awards – before an unsuccessful remake was launched in the US. The series was created by Jane Turner and Gina Riley, who played the title characters. It also starred Magda Szubanski, Glenn Robbins and Peter Rowsthorn. Kath & Kim reached a new audience in when it landed on Australian Netflix, with the character’s fashion choices and cheesy dialogue sparking another bout of popularity via social media. News of the house’s demolition come amid rumours of a revival of the series. Woman’s Day reported that an announcement was imminent about a seasonal revival to be broadcast next year. The magazine reported the reboot would air on a streaming platform. But last year, Szubanski, who played Sharon Strzelecki, said a reunion should be “off the table” because the show “holds such a special place in people’s memories.” “If we did a live show which was a best-of or something like that, that’s different, but to actually try and do a whole new series – you can never capture that magic again,” she told KIIS FM. “I feel fine to go off and do Sharon stuff. We don’t know that world of Sharon’s world.”",News/Australia news,Kath & Kim’s fictional Melbourne home gets a very real demolition,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/02/kath-kims-fictional-melbourne-home-gets-a-very-real-demolition
5/2/2022,"The award-winning Guardian photographer David Levene offers tips on how to get a good picture. Be bold and get close to your subject rather than shooting from afar – that may either make your subject too insignificant in the frame or mean that unwanted elements creep in to your composition. If you are super-close, then try using wide-angle lenses, which might make your images feel more dynamic. Get creative with shooting angles: see how your subject looks from down low, or find a high vantage point from which to shoot down. Check out alternative points of view rather than just accepting what you see before you. As obvious as it sounds, it is worth remembering that photography is dependent on light and, in general, good-quality light will help you to produce more impactful imagery. Sure, golden hour (the period just after sunrise or just before sunset) can be beautiful but you might find more interesting conditions just before sunrise or after sunset, as the blue evening shade mixes with the orange and yellow glows of urban night-lighting. If you are using a standalone camera, see if you can operate it on fully manual, or semi-automatic, modes and experiment with different apertures and shutter speeds. Soften the background (if you are relatively close to your subject) by shooting with a wide aperture, such as f2.8. Experiment with long shutter speeds, perhaps even moving the camera while exposing your photograph, to see what kind of results you can get. If you are using a phone camera, you should be able to switch off the automatic flash, and may be able to override other settings, too. Invest in better lenses to see an immediate improvement in your photographs. Beyond the “kit” lenses that might come as standard with your camera, you will find better contrast and sharpness with fixed focal length or better-quality zoom lenses. “Fast” lenses (those that achieve a wider aperture) will also allow you to shoot more effectively in lower light conditions. All modern DSLR and mirrorless cameras (and even some smartphones) will allow you to shoot raw files (such as CR2, NEF or DNG). These retain far more information than Jpegs, which compress files by discarding information and detail. You will need more memory card space and hard drive storage but your images will have far more scope when it comes to processing them. Experiment with some of the basic adjustment tools in programmes such as Photoshop, Lightroom or Capture One to find ways to enhance your images. Tools such as exposure, shadow detail (HDR), clarity and vignetting can do wonders for your photographs (particularly if you’re shooting in raw). Don’t overdo it, though.",News/Technology,How to take great photos – tips from an award-winning photographer,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/02/tips-taking-great-pictures-photographer-camera-manual
5/2/2022,"Just as many of us grasped for connections during lockdown, the pandemic has inspired Eunic London, an umbrella organisation for EU cultural institutions, to dwell on the meaning of relationships for this year’s showcase for European short films, put together by curator Shira Macleod. Not all are – as the strand’s subtitle would have it – loving encounters: break-ups, bureaucratic frustration and unsettling alien fauna crop up, too. And the one explicitly Covid-related work, Romanian director Alina Manolache’s mesmerising I Am Here, features relationships by their absence: the social vacuum on display in CCTV footage from the Trevi Fountain, Chinese pharmacies, a British golf course and other depopulated locations around the world. Relationships take a politicised shade in Alexandra Matheou’s A Summer Place, a lush dalliance between a Cypriot food artist and the Arab refugee she rescues from the sea. But its Paolo Sorrentino-esque scenes of excess draw the lines between European haves and outsider have-nots somewhat heavy-handedly. More subtle on the immigration beat is the forlorn black-and-white drama Beyond Is the Day, from Poland’s Damian Kocur, which turns an out-of-the-way river barge into an intercontinental metaphor. Eunic’s selection broadly tries to buoy us up as societies emerge from the pandemic with an upbeat view of relationships, as in the delightful Forest Coal Pit, by Siôn Marshall-Waters, about a pair of elderly Welsh brothers who, despite the rigours of running their farm, are never short on wonder about the world. “Well, they’re in perpetual motion, shrews, aren’t they?” one marvels. But there’s an anxious pulse to Cuckoo!, in which Dutch director Jörgen Scholtens puts his cuckoo clock-dwelling protagonist on a tight schedule, ensuring an elderly lady takes her medication; it plays like an absurdist Werther’s Original advert. An even angstier mother frets about sexual predators on behalf of her gay son in Are You Hungry?, creating a honeytrap profile for him as “Tomi of Finland”. But Teemu Niukkanen’s droll and sharply characterised feature asserts that the kids are alright. “I like rainbows as natural phenomena,” deadpans Tomi about his LGBT-flagging T-shirt. Most striking are two shorts from Croatia and Scotland. The resplendent Into the Blue is a teenage love triangle unfolding in a relaxed riviera setting, only with intense undercurrents. Gracija Filipovic is darkly seductive as the interloper crashing her childhood friend’s budding romance, while director Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović makes the sapphire depths undulate with loneliness and liberation. Josephine Lohoar Self’s animation The Fabric of You sounds cosier, but there’s an unsettling texture to its tryst between a Bronx mouse tailor and his well-spoken client. This rodent Remains of the Day discourses smoothly on the link between fashion and dissimulation, while its frayed, writhing stop-motion hints at agony beneath the breast. The standard of work is perhaps more consistent than that of last year’s group, but it’s also notable that, with plenty in the 15- to 25-minute range, the selection pushes the definition of short. One final mention then to Maria Fredriksson’s documentary entry Svonni vs the Swedish Tax Agency, which manages to pack in a tale of one women and her dog, her struggle to get it recognised as tax-deductible, and the broader context of Sami reindeer herding, in a succinct and springy five minutes. Brief encounters can be the most intense.

5/2/2022,"Hazel Rose’s coffin was supposed to have been adorned with her favourite spring flowers for her funeral in March last year. But she was sent to rest in a bare coffin when the sheaf, ordered from a London florist, failed to arrive. A year later, her family is still awaiting a refund – despite having taken their case to the small claims court. “It was extremely distressing for the family when my mother’s flowers did not arrive and it would have been a consolation to have the case resolved by the first anniversary of her death,” said Hazel’s daughter, Andrea. Instead, she and her brother, Anthony, have so far spent £143 in court fees trying to reclaim the £110 they paid for the flowers. Andrea says principle rather than money has prompted her long battle. The company disputes the claim and says it was given the wrong time for the delivery. The case exposes gaps in the legal protection for consumers and underlines why some campaigners say the county court money claims system is unfit for purpose. A county court money claim is the last resort for customers who are left out of pocket when a trader fails to deliver. The customer files a claim with the court and pays a fee, starting from £35, and the trader is sent a letter asking it to pay up. If it doesn’t, the customer can ask for a judgment. If the court decides in the customer’s favour, a county court judgment (CCJ) is issued, ordering the defendant to pay the debt plus associated costs and appropriate compensation. This CCJ will blight their credit record for six years, but it is not a criminal offence for defendants to ignore the court ruling. If they do, claimants must pay further fees to enforce it with no certainty of success. For claims worth less than £300, the cost of pursuing the defendant can exceed the sum they owe. Figures from the Registry Trust show that only 16% of CCJs in England and Wales were recorded by the courts as satisfied between 2020 and 2021, which means the vast majority went unpaid. There is no data on how many orders were settled without courts being informed. According to Arun Chauhan, the founder of Tenet Law, the system is unfit for purpose for claims under £3,000. “My experience is the process, time, stress, and money involved are disproportionate, certainly against rogue traders who know the chase to recover money is often off-putting so people just let it go,” he said. “There needs to be a speedier system with an automated recovery process using bailiffs if the defendant fails to provide evidence to the court that they’ve paid.” More than 50% of small claims issued between 2018 and 2021 were for £500 or less and, in January, a report by the Civil Justice Council called for reforms to the process for low-value claims, including streamlined hearings and better information for litigants. However, the proposals do not address the fact that most CCJs are not honoured. In the Roses’ case, a CCJ last May ordered the florist, Clapham Flowers, to pay Andrea £1,000, including the £60 court fees and compensation. No payment was received and in August Andrea applied for a warrant of control to allow bailiffs to enforce the debt. Three months later, Clapham Flowers tried and failed to have the CCJ dismissed. That was the last the family heard from both the florist and the court until the Observer intervened in February. “When we phoned the court to ask about progress with the warrant, a recorded message said that the phone service is not operational and that queries should be emailed,” said Andrea. “We emailed six times with no response.” A warrant of control was issued six months after Andrea’s application when the Observer contacted the Ministry of Justice, and a bailiff visited Clapham Flowers. A month later, she received an undated, unsigned letter from the court stating that the bailiff had been unable to meet the debtor or gain peaceful entry. An email from the bailiff, meanwhile, claimed that he had visited the shop but found nothing of value to seize. Aimee Emmett, manager of Clapham Flowers, said Andrea had misinformed staff of the funeral arrangements, that the CCJ was issued to the wrong address, that she was unaware of the hearing that dismissed her appeal and that she was contesting the demand for payment left by the bailiff. HM Courts and Tribunals Service said: “We apologise for the frustrating experience this family has had and would like to reassure others that our staff work hard to help the public claim back money owed to them.” The service said that it was aiming to cut red tape to free more resources to fund bailiff action. It suggested that claimants should apply for an Order to Obtain Information to establish a debtor’s assets and decide which method would be most effective to enforce a CCJ. However, enforcement is effective only if the defendant has assets sufficient to cover the debt. Sole traders can have their private possessions seized, but directors of limited companies cannot be held personally liable. Writs of control issued by a high court are more effective than county court warrants, since enforcement is carried out by private companies who are paid by results and have the authority to force entry to commercial premises. However, they can be issued only for debts of more than £600 and fees, which may be claimed from the debtor, can exceed £700, plus 7% of the recovered sum. Andrea says the system has let her family down. “The failure of the florist to deliver flowers for her funeral has been compounded by the failure of the courts to act on the judgments they have made,” she said. Jacqueline McBride is £11,555 out of pocket because a garage owner liquidated his company after she obtained a CCJ. She had brought a money claim against MOT 4U, trading as Westbere Garage in Canterbury, after it failed to return a motorhome she took in for repairs nearly two years ago. “The director, Ernest Biela, has prevented me collecting my vehicle [and] declined to give me an invoice detailing the work he claims to have done,” she said. “He didn’t defend himself when I brought a county court claim and has since ignored the CCJ awarded last September. When bailiffs were instructed, they were advised that Mr Biela had put the company into voluntary liquidation because of my claim. I was planning to sell the motorhome to finance essential maintenance to my home, but it seems I have nowhere else to turn.” Biela, director of three similarly named firms and two dissolved ones registered to the same address, said the dispute concerned additional repairs authorised by a third party while McBride was in hospital and he said he would now be willing to engage with mediation. “I have never tried to avoid the responsibility of care with respect to a customer’s vehicle, but the waters have been muddied with exaggerations,” he said.",Lifestyle/Money,People left out of pocket by traders say UK county court system ‘unfit for purpose’,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/02/small-claims-court-county-frustrated-rulings-customers
