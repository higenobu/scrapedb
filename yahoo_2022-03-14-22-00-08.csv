3/14/2022,"Maybe you heard about the invasive species of spider, the size of a child's hand, that's expected to appear along much of the East Coast this spring. Catch up quick: Large Joro spiders — millions of them — are expected to use their webs like parachutes to travel with the wind, according to a Feb. 17 study from researchers at the University of Georgia. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. The big picture: Spider shmider, as we say in Central Texas. The Joro spiders are actually harmless to people, as their fangs are too small to break human skin. Of note: They're named for Jorōgumo, a spider-like creature of Japanese folklore that can shapeshift into a woman to seduce its prey. Now this is a knife: The thing that leaves us with cold sweats is the Texas giant red-headed centipede. It's a venomous crawler that can grow up to at least 8 inches (!) long. The head and first two body segments are red, and the other body segments are typically black with traces of green. With its yellow legs, it looks like something radioactive. Any of its 20-odd legs can deliver venom, excreting poison into fresh cuts with its feet. The centipede snacks on lizards and can snatch flying insects out of the air — and its sharp, painful bites can lead to swelling, headaches and nausea for humans — partly because you're thinking, ""I can't believe that thing just bit me."" You'll want to make sure they're not hiding in that blouse you're about to don. True story: Asher once spotted a red-headed centipede on a carpet in a house in the Hill Country where his kids had been playing moments earlier.

3/14/2022,"Watch: Huge unexploded bomb removed from flat in Ukraine This is the tense moment a large unexploded Russian bomb was delicately removed from a block of flats in a city in Ukraine. The discovery was made as Russian forces continue to strike residential areas of Ukraine as part of its ongoing invasion. The unexploded device landed in an apartment block in the city of Chernihiv. It was extracted by Ukrainian bomb disposal experts, who used a crane to carry the bomb out of the damaged building and on to the back of a lorry. Video footage of the operation was posted on Twitter by the State Emergency Service of Ukraine (DSNS). In a tweet posted on Sunday, it said three OFAB-500 air bombs were removed “with precision and care” from residential areas in Chernihiv in one day. The city, 80 miles north of the capital Kyiv, has been a regular target for Russian bombings. Read more: What is a thermobaric 'vacuum' bomb and why is it so devastating? Last week, Russia admitted using a thermobaric “vacuum” bomb in the city, which has been under fire since the beginning of the Russian invasion. Ukraine claims that 47 civilians - some of them queuing for bread - were killed in a Russian strike in Chernihiv on 3 March. Meanwhile, at least two people died and 12 were injured following a Russian air stroke on a residential building in the Obolon district of Kyiv, it was reported on Monday. At least 35 people were killed in a Russian air strike on a Ukrainian military base outside the city of Lviv, close to the Polish border, on Sunday. About 30 Russian cruise missiles were fired at the Yavoriv training base, Ukrainian officials claimed. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky warned it was “only a matter of time” before the Nato alliance was struck following the attack, less than 15 miles from the border with Nato member Poland. Watch: Ukraine president says Russia trying to create 'pseudo-republic' in his country's south Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned against the formation of a “pseudo-republic” in the south of his country, much like those in Donetsk and Luhansk. On Monday, UK health secretary Sajid Javid said he believed a direct attack on a Nato member was still “very unlikely”, but warned it would trigger a response from the alliance, which has a policy of mutual defence. Javid told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’ve made it very clear to the Russians even before the start of this conflict. “Even if a single Russian toecap steps into Nato territory, then it will be considered an act of war.” The attack on the Yavoriv base, which has previously been used by Nato to train Ukrainian soldiers, was one of the western-most targets struck by Russia during the invasion.",World/Yahoo News UK,Huge unexploded bomb removed from Ukrainian flats destroyed by Russian forces,https://news.yahoo.com/unexploded-bomb-ukraine-block-of-flats-destroyed-by-russian-forces-110802526.html
3/14/2022,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Julien Ponthus. There's arguably never a good time for the COVID-19 pandemic to make a comeback but the surging cases in China over the weekend come at a moment when the global economy could do without another layer of stress to its already stretched supply chains. Ukraine's two leading providers of neon, which produce about half the world's supply of the key ingredient for making chips, have halted operations, threatening to raise prices and to aggravate the semiconductor shortage. This morning, Chinese stocks fell as domestic COVID-19 cases jumped to a two-year high, prompting Beijing's technology and financial hubs to impose restrictions. How severe the outbreak will prove and how much pain it will bring to the global economy is anyone's guess, but the economic fallout of Russia's invasion of Ukraine is already taking a heavy toll. Analysts have started trimming corporate earnings' estimates and on Thursday, the European Central Bank cut its 2022 growth target to 3.7% from 4.2% while raising its inflation forecast to 5.1%. This week all eyes will be on the Federal Reserve and U.S. producer price index (PPI) data expected to show an annual 10% jump on Tuesday, will set the stage nicely for a rate hike. A quick look at the fast-ascending popularity of search queries for 'stagflation' on Google Trends confirms that central banks hawks and doves are not the only ones worrying about sky-rocketing oil prices and higher rates slowing the economy. In the meantime, both the pan-European STOXX 600 and Wall Street's S&P 500 are down over 11% year-to-date but this morning futures are pointing to a positive start of the week. With low visibility on the macro front, trading these past weeks has focused on news from the war in Ukraine and on diplomatic efforts to put an end to it. On Friday, stocks jumped when Russian President Vladimir Putin noted ""certain positive shifts"" in the negotiations and investors and trading algorithms will be on the lookout for any sign that the crisis could somehow de-escalate as talks continue today.

3/14/2022,"As Russia's invasion of Ukraine intensifies with shelling of cities, the CEO of a private security contractor hired to extract clients from the region is troubled by what he's seeing. “The conditions on the ground are worsening every day,” Global Guardian CEO Dale Buckner told Yahoo Finance (video above). ""When we started, of course, the front line trace of the Russian forces which was much further north near Kyiv, the capital, was much further to the east near Donbas, and they were in, within the Crimea in the south. Obviously, all that's changed. So now we're moving and flowing with where the Russians are moving towards and we're trying to avoid those areas as we continue to execute these evacuations."" Buckner, speaking on Friday, added that ""we went into Kyiv and Odessa and Dnipro... this morning. In each case, literally as the vehicles are standing there, as we're manifesting clients and Ukrainians onto the bus, you can hear missile strikes, you can hear bombs going off.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24 has been marked by heavy fighting and intense resistance from Ukrainian forces. The conflict has led to widespread sanctions against Russia in addition to major U.S. companies suspending business in Russia. Companies with employees in Ukraine are turning to private security firms like Global Guardian to extract workers and other VIPs. Extracting workers has become a top priority for tech companies that have tapped into the country’s burgeoning tech hub. “IT profession here is very popular among the young people, so a lot of universities, they grow their faculties for technical professionals,” N-iX Founder and CEO Andrew Pavliv recently told Yahoo Finance in an interview. “Software developers in Ukraine, they have much bigger wages than the average in the country, so it’s a popular job to do for young people.” Buckner said the current evacuations are classified “as emergency response.” And because many countries have restricted their airspace amid the invasion, clients must first be flown to countries like the UAE before returning to their home countries or headquarters. He added that Global Guardian has also shifted to taking on some humanitarian efforts despite primarily operating as a for-hire private security group. “When we don’t have [extraction teams] tasked, we are running free shuttles to the border of Romania, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia,” he said, adding that the security firm is also making room for civilians on corporate missions. “When we do execute a mission on behalf of a corporate client, we’re bringing families and all elements of family members.""
