4/7/2022,"Dozens of thieving sea lions in western Canada have spent the last few weeks gorging on fish after brazenly slipping into an industrial salmon farm – and ignoring all attempts to make them move on. Cermaq, the aquaculture giant with operations in Norway, Chile and Canada, says the wily predators were able to evade netting and electric fences in late March as part of a “breach event” at the Rant Point farm near Tofino in British Columbia. Local conservation groups, who oppose the fish farms and only learned of the breach on Sunday, have warned the sea lions themselves are in danger the longer they spend inside the farm. “We witnessed the sea lion going over one of the fences jumping right into a ‘bird net’, which is suspended net above the pens. He struggled for quite some time to free himself,” said Bonny Glambeck of Clayoquot Action, a local environmental group. “There’s a lot of ropes and hoses around, so we’re increasingly concerned about entanglement.” In little more than a decade, more than 100 sea lions have drowned after getting tangled in fish farm nets, as has one humpback whale, highlighting the dangers the farms and their nets pose to local wildlife. Efforts to scare the sea lions away, including with loud noises, have so far failed. The company said exits are available to the intruders “should they choose to leave”– an offer the sea lions appear to have declined. In 2016, after sea lions breached another Cermaq fish farm, Canada’s department of fisheries and oceans authorized the company to shoot the animals. The DFO says there is a “strict requirement” that none of the sea lions be killed. Sea lions, a common mammal in the waters off Vancouver Island, typically hunt in groups and feast on herring, salmon, rock fish and even small sharks. But the pinnipeds hit paydirt when they made their way into pens full of salmon. The farm can hold as many as 500,000 Atlantic salmon, although the company had already started the weeks-long process of harvesting in March when the first sea lions arrived. More sea lions have since joined in the heist, much to the frustration of the company, which says it hopes to finish harvesting by the third week of April. The breach at the farm has also drawn attention to the British Columbia fish farms, a number of which have been ordered to close by the federal government by 2025 amid environmental concerns and opposition from Indigenous nations. Companies in the region, including Cermaq, have fought the order and say thousands of jobs will be lost. Glambeck worries the sea lions will become habituated to humans and once the salmon are gone, turn to the 14 other farms in the area. “They’re very intelligent animals and it’s so disheartening and heartbreaking to see these animals being potentially harmed by this industry,” she said.",News/Environment,Thieving sea lions break into salmon farm and refuse to leave,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/07/sea-lions-fish-farm-british-columbia
4/7/2022,"An artwork recognising almost 1,000 women and children killed by men in Australia has been removed from a Melbourne museum, partly on the grounds it could traumatise some visitors. Melbourne artist Dans Bain was asked on Wednesday to remove her 30 metre work, The Lost Petition, from the Her Place Women’s Museum before Friday’s opening of an exhibition celebrating 25 years of women in politics, curated by the Australian Labor Party-affiliated network Emily’s List. According to a statement issued by the chair of the Her Place Women’s Museum board, Mary Delahunty, The Lost Petition was taken down because of the work’s size and scale, and the lack of an alternative space to install it in the east Melbourne museum. But Emily’s List national co-convenor, Leigh Svendsen, confirmed to the Guardian the organisation had asked the museum’s board to have the artwork removed, partly out of concern that there were insufficient measures in place for people who might be triggered by the work’s confronting nature. “It’s a fantastic exhibit, but we only have volunteers to staff the Her Story exhibition, we certainly haven’t any capacity or ability to support people if they become upset by Dans’ work,” Svendsen said. “I’m not suggesting that that would necessarily happen [but] I think that’s something that needs to be taken into consideration.” The Lost Petition fabric artwork consists of 12 white bedsheets stitched together and bears the names of 986 women and children murdered through domestic violence since 2008. As more deaths occur, their names are added to the work. The artist said the Emily’s List request to remove her work was like a “double erasure” of the women and children who had already had their lives snatched away. “I’ve had families contact me and asked for photos - I had learned just recently, a family from New Zealand, their mother is on the list, and the family asked me to take photos,” Bain told the Guardian. “I had to say, unfortunately, we’ve had to remove it from public viewing. And it just feels awful that we’re doing that to families. “This work is about bringing visibility to this issue of male violence against women and children and I’m pretty devastated that these lives have now been doubly erased because it’s been decided The Lost Petition is an uncomfortable reality.” The names of the victims inscribed on the artwork are provided by the founder of the anti-gendered violence group the Red Heart Campaign, Sherele Moody, who said the work’s removal was an “uncaring slap in the face” for the families of every victim named on the artwork. “I know some people hate this artwork because it tells an uncomfortable truth about violence in Australia,” she said. “But to see a museum for women and another high profile women’s organisation deem it inappropriate is massive kick in the guts for me and for Dans. “Saying now is not the time to hang this project shows how dead women and kids are an inconvenience to even those who should know better.” Delahunty’s statement issued on Thursday said the museum board had made the decision to reinstall the artwork later in the year, in agreement with the artist. “We are planning to welcome The Lost Petition back to Her Place Museum later in the year as a focus of the Her Voice program of Australian Women’s activism, after May when The Lost Petition will tour regionally,” she said. “It is a powerful artwork and that power is reflected in the feedback we have received.”",News/Australia news,‘Doubly erased’: artwork recording names of domestic violence victims removed from Melbourne museum,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/07/doubly-erased-artwork-recording-names-of-domestic-violence-victims-removed-from-melbourne-museum
4/7/2022,"Acting is all about immersing yourself in a character, embracing someone else’s reality and leaving yourself behind in the process. That is, unless you go for the ultimate role: yourself. For those who have been unable to resist the allure of the familiar, appearing as a heightened version of themselves in a film can lead to one of the most intriguing performances of their career. Nicolas Cage is the latest actor to put his on- and off-screen persona under the white-hot glare of the Hollywood microscope in The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, a bracingly original meta-comedy. Not only is he playing himself – albeit a more cash-strapped version facing financial ruin – he also stars as his imaginary alter ego: Nicky (a Wild At Heart-era Cage who has been eerily de-aged with CGI). In recent years, on screen and off, Cage has garnered a reputation for eccentricity, to put it mildly, but he has been at great pains to stress just how far he is from this fictionalised version of himself, even though he also landed himself in serious debt after reportedly spending his $150m fortune. “I have a lot of quiet moments at home with just my cat, reading,” he told the Hollywood Reporter last month. “Do we want to show any of that? No, because it’s not fun.” Showing A-list stars on an egotistical rampage – now that’s fun. Usually, when actors portray themselves in films, it’s played for laughs, although there has been the occasional foray into drama. “We don’t really know what an actor is like in reality, so what they’re actually performing is a version of themselves that is known and disseminated in culture, in films and by chatshows,” says Dr Andrew Stubbs, senior lecturer in film, media and communication at Staffordshire University. The most successful performances within this niche tend to either exaggerate an actor’s public image or play against it completely. This is why Bill Murray’s cameo in Zombieland was so effective: he leaned into his off-screen persona as a lovable eccentric, the kind of celebrity who turns up to a stranger’s engagement photoshoot and crashes stag dos. In Zombieland, Murray hides out in his huge mansion as the zombie apocalypse rages on around him, pretending to be one of the undead when he ventures out, which just seems like a very Bill Murray thing to do. Meanwhile, Keanu Reeves’s performance as a smug hipster parody of himself in Always Be My Maybe is a million miles away from his reputation as one of Hollywood’s nicest celebrities, long heralded for being sensitive, humble and unfailingly good natured. Definitely not the kind of person who would inspire an I Punched Keanu Reeves rap from a love rival, as he does in Nahnatchka Khan’s romcom. An actor playing themselves in a film also opens up a chance for reinvention. Take Neil Patrick Harris, who appears as Cage’s agent in The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. Before he starred in Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, he was primarily known for his role as wholesome medical wunderkind Doogie Howser in the US sitcom. His performance as a satirical version of himself in the stoner comedy and the two sequels that followed reinvigorated his career. Playing an arrogant sleazeball with a predilection for vast amounts of cocaine and strippers allowed him to transition into more adult parts. A year later, he joined the cast of How I Met Your Mother as brash womaniser Barney Stinson. “These films are an opportunity to enhance actors’ brands,” says Stubbs. “Taking on these roles, they’re often required to be quite self-conscious and self-deprecating. Those are qualities that are highly valued in our society. So in that sense, it helps the actor to shed any ideas about their egotism.” There have been notable performances from female actors playing themselves in films. Julia Roberts went meta on meta as the wife of a con artist pretending to be Julia Roberts as part of an elaborate heist in Ocean’s Twelve. Then there is Megan Fox’s cameo in The Dictator, which takes a dig at her overly sexualised image, and Emma Watson shows up wielding an axe in apocalyptic comedy This Is the End. But when it comes to celebrities playing themselves, especially in lead roles in films, most of the time, it’s done by a white male actor. Women and people of colour are sidelined in supporting parts, if they appear at all – just as they are in the wider film industry. “Actresses’ careers tend to be shorter, they have fewer opportunities to create a successful career and sustain it through the years, so they have to be much more careful,” says Helen O’Hara, author of Women vs Hollywood: The Fall and Rise of Women in Film. Plus, there’s the ever-persistent misconception that women just aren’t as funny as men. They’re not even being given the opportunity to try, she says. “A lot of these [parts] come along as fun cameos with your friends. The comedy groups tend to be quite close-knit groups of men.” Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, for instance, hammed it up hilariously in a guest appearance spoofing their Good Will Hunting success in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, because they’re friends with the director Kevin Smith. This Is the End features a host of celebrity cameos but the core clique of the film – its co-director Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel and Danny McBride – are close friends who constantly pop up in each other’s films. “Women have much more to lose than men do, if it goes wrong,” says O’Hara. “People are much quicker to believe that women are divas. So it’s much harder to poke fun at themselves while reinforcing those stereotypes, which could be very damaging to their career.” At the same time, these roles might initially seem lighthearted and playful, but in fact they often cast a satirical eye over the myth of stardom: not just how it’s created by an actor and the Hollywood machine, but also how the public buys into it as well. “It can prompt the audience to consider how a star might have been mistreated or misrepresented by paparazzi and the press, and think critically about their star image rather than accepting it at face value,” says Stubbs. Despite a string of classy dramatic roles on stage and screen, John Malkovich’s most celebrated performance is as himself in Being John Malkovich. Director Spike Jonze’s audacious comedy revolves around Craig (John Cusack), a puppeteer who discovers a magical portal into the Dangerous Liaisons actor’s mind – and promptly sets up a business selling tickets for $200 a pop so others can be Malkovich for 15 minutes. Charlie Kaufman’s ingenious script ridicules the emptiness of fame and our worship of celebrities as Malkovich – played with gleeful narcissism as he sends up his dour off-screen persona – starts to unravel spectacularly. And that’s what these roles really are – they provide our own portal to glean what we can about celebrity culture, even though we know what we’re really seeing is a reflection from a distorted mirror, a parody of what we think stardom might be rather than the reality. Still, we’re being invited to be in on the joke and the actor is being such a good sport, so we’ll probably be laughing along, trying not to cringe too hard if it falls flat.

4/7/2022,"MLB will announce a new rule for next season which will allow managers a limited number of infield shifts a game. So it becomes a strategy of when to seek the defensive advantage. Should managers wait until the ninth inning? Keep their infield moves for certain players? Sounds like fun to me! DL The New York Yankees somehow win 100 games. It’s been fun mocking the organization’s uncharacteristic lack of spending this offseason, particularly as the rest of the AL East has gotten tougher. But history tells us that the Yankees have an annoying knack of going on a tear right when everybody counts them out. HF The Detroit Tigers, five years removed from their last winning campaign and three since losing a mind-numbing 114 games, will contend for a playoff spot until the final week of the regular season. BAG Actual baseball, for 162 games, with fans in the seats. Between the pandemic and the work stoppage that I believed would kill the entire 2022 season, this campaign is as welcome as they come. DL No longer wasting precious minutes of my life watching pitchers hit in the National League. With the newly adopted universal DH, baseball has finally fully entered the modern world. It’s a rare win for common sense in 2022’s America, although I will admit it was cool when Bartolo Colon hit a home run that one time. HF The pandemic gave baseball commissioner Rob Manfred the perfect cover to enact a handful of experimental rules designed to cut down on overlong games and limit physical contact. Predictably (and tragically), the universal designated hitter is here to stay. But I was pleasantly surprised to see two of the others won’t be back for 2022: 1) seven-inning doubleheaders and 2) the extra-innings rule starting each half-inning after the ninth with a runner on second base. BAG If Shohei Ohtani is healthy, hits and pitches, how is anyone else going to win the AL MVP award? And now that he’s allowed to hit in games after being removed as a hurler, he’ll have even more at-bats. There is a bit more competition in the NL however, where the majestic Juan Soto should get the award he deserved to win last year. DL Let’s go all chalk here. I’m just going to be Mr Predictable and pick Mr Predictable in the AL with the Los Angeles Angels’ Mike Trout. In the NL, we’ll go with the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Mookie Betts. It’s unlikely that both will win, but it’s pretty good odds that at least one of these bets will pay off, barring injuries. HF Toronto’s Vladimir Guerrero Jr may be the best hitter in the game today. But it seems the AL award until further notice belongs to Ohtani, the two-way Japanese star with a once-in-a-century skillset. In the National League, it’s Washington outfielder Soto. BAG Carlos Rodon is making a move to a bigger park in San Francisco which will help the former White Sox hurler move into Cy Young territory but Zack Wheeler, totally robbed of the award in 2021 will get it this time around. The AL race is probably the most open in years, especially with all the question marks hanging around Gerrit Cole. Robbie Ray certainly has a chance to repeat in his new roomy confines in Seattle. DL The Atlanta Braves’ Max Fried hasn’t yet hit his ceiling and this award certainly feels within his grasp, even if some other NL pitchers have more name recognition. Keeping up with the Yankees theme, let’s go with their ace Cole in the AL, especially assuming that older voters are still infatuated with the concept of pitching wins. HF The National League race opened up with last week’s news that Mets ace Jacob deGrom will miss significant time due to a shoulder injury. Look for Dodgers righty Walker Buehler to make the most of his absence. In the American League, it’s Yankees star Cole’s trophy to lose. BAG Good lord the Jays can rake, with a lineup looking like a modern day murderers row. They lost Ray from their rotation, but gained Kevin Gausman, so it’s all there for a Toronto team bracing for a full season of home games for the first time since 2019. That said, it’s probably the toughest division in baseball, and it should be a war to the finish, where the Jays pip the Rays on the last day of the season. DL New York Yankees. The AL East is going to be brutal this year, to the point where literally all the AL wildcards could emerge from the division. The only predictable thing might be that the Baltimore Orioles are going to be one of the worst teams in baseball, everything else might come down to the last week. HF Toronto Blue Jays. Don’t be surprised if the smart-spending Tampa Bay Rays figure out a way to come out on top again, but it’s simply too hard to pick against this Blue Jays lineup in a stacked division that will end up sending four teams to the postseason. BAG Tony La Russa may annoy his fanbase, but nothing will stop the White Sox from repeating as AL Central champs. Think of it as a 162 game playoff tune-up for the Pale Hose, where an early-round ouster may not be as inevitable as most would think. They’re extremely talented, and if they invest at the trade deadline, they will compete for a “piece of metal” in October. DL Chicago White Sox. Their fate would certainly look sunnier if not for Lance Lynn’s knee injury, but this is a White Sox team that won 93 games last season and they have a highly potent offense. HF Chicago White Sox. The South Siders are once again the most complete team in the American League’s weakest division, although they’ll weather a more spirited challenge from the improved Twins. BAG Seattle were by far the luckiest team in baseball last season, competing for a wildcard game berth until late in the season. But even if lightning strikes twice, the Astros are still poised to win the division for the fifth time in six seasons. The biggest question is whether the Angels, with Mike Trout and Ohtani, will finally reach the postseason, something neutral baseball fans should be pining for. DL It still blows my mind that the Houston Astros have overtaken the Yankees as the biggest heels in baseball. It’s close to impossible to root for this particular ownership, but it’s hard not to hope for the best for veteran manager Dusty Baker and 39-year-old ace Justin Verlander. HF Houston Astros. The Mariners were already knocking on the door even before adding Cy Young award winner Ray to the rotation. But the reigning American League pennant winners remain the class of this division, even without Carlos Correa. BAG The Freddie Freeman-less Braves shouldn’t suffer thanks to the aggressive acquisition of Matt Olson. And the champs also boosted the back of their bullpen with Kenley Jansen and Collin McHugh, so they shouldn’t have too much trouble in their bid to repeat. DL If the New York Mets had some health breaks, they could be a potential candidate here but there is no conceivable dimension where the Mets will ever remain healthy (Jacob deGrom has already been put on ice and Max Scherzer remains an early question mark). I’m going to hand this division over to instead to the Atlanta Braves. HF Philadelphia Phillies. Bryce Harper’s MVP campaign was weighed down by a Philly bullpen whose 34 blown saves equaled the 2004 Colorado Rockies’ major-league record (although the Nationals’ 35 pipped them both). Enter Corey Knebel, the 30-year-old closer who bet on himself by signing a one-year, $10m contract. The improved bullpen and offseason additions of Kyle Schwarber and Nick Castellanos will see the Phillies end their decade-long postseason drought. BAG The Brewers are a ton of fun with a deep pitching rotation combined with an electric bullpen and a more than satisfactory lineup. The only club that can compete with Milwaukee are the Cardinals, and their rotation takes a hit with Jack Flaherty’s injury issues. It’s cakewalk territory for the Brew Crew. DL This St Louis Cardinals team is so old that the most famous player on the lineup was retired until a few weeks ago. While Albert Pujols won’t likely be much of a factor in the division, Yadier Molina and Adam Wainwright can still take this team into the playoffs. I’d call them sentimental favorites among the baseball graybeards. HF Milwaukee Brewers. A stout rotation including reigning Cy Young award winner Corbin Burnes, Brandon Woodruff, Freddy Peralta, Adrian Houser and Eric Lauer will see the Brewers repeat as champions of MLB’s weakest division. BAG Expect the Dodgers to take back the NL West after the surprising Giants take a small step back. LA are loaded once again, adding Freeman, while their looming lineup question is whether or not Cody Bellinger will recover from a dismal 2021. Sadly, the Padres’ long-term loss of Fernando Tatis Jr takes a bit of the zetz out of this would-be stacked division. DL The Los Angeles Dodgers’ biggest issue just might be manager Dave Roberts’s ongoing habit of making life more difficult for himself. This time around, Roberts went out of his way to guarantee a title, something which hasn’t paid off since New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath pulled off the trick in the NFL. HF LA Dodgers. Baseball’s biggest spenders offset the departures of Corey Seager and Max Scherzer by adding Freeman. That allows Dave Roberts to deploy a lineup with MVP winners in right field (Betts), center field (Bellinger) and first base (Freeman) and a glut of former All-Stars in between (Trea Turner, Max Muncy, Justin Turner, Will Smith, Chris Taylor). BAG Rays, Red Sox, Angels. DL Blue Jays, Rays, Red Sox. HF Yankees, Rays, Red Sox. BAG Padres, Mets, Giants. DL Brewers, Giants, Padres. HF Braves, Giants, Padres. BAG Blue Jays 4-3 Rays. DL Yankees 4-2 White Sox. HF White Sox 4-3 Blue Jays. BAG Dodgers 4-3 Braves. DL Dodgers 4-2 Braves. HF Dodgers 4-1 Braves. BAG Blue Jays 4-2 Dodgers. The Blue Jays have one of the most compelling lineups in MLB, and if they all click, it could be a generational group that brings a title to Canada for the first time since 1993. A dynamic, young and colorful roster led by Vladimir Guerrero only needs pitching help and based on the way aggressive ownership has collected talent over the past few seasons, there’s no reason to believe team president Mark Shapiro won’t bring in any missing pieces at the trade deadline. The Rogers Center is the loudest venue in baseball, and it will explode in October with a win over Los Angeles in the World Series. DL Dodgers 4-1 Yankees. Did you know that the Yankees and Dodgers both used to play in New York and had an intense rivalry? Get ready to hear about it, again and again, should this World Series matchup come to fruition. Unfortunately, the series might not last long enough for the broadcasters to give us the complete history because the Dodgers once again will have the most complete lineup in the major leagues, plus Walker Buehler and Clayton Kershaw ready to pitch twice in a seven-game series. HF Dodgers 4-2 White Sox. The deep-pocketed, talent-stacked LA Dodgers were favorites even before the Freeman signing that won the offseason. It’s simply baffling they only have a single Covid title to show for their decade-plus of dominance, speaking to the crapshoot of a playoff format where, for better or worse, the best team doesn’t always come out on top. In a game with no sure things, the Dodgers are the closest thing to one.

4/7/2022,"A cabinet minister has defended the chancellor’s wife for having non-domicile status in the UK, allowing her to avoid paying millions of pounds in tax on foreign earnings, and hit back at “malicious attacks” against her. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, insisted Rishi Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murthy, had been “incredibly transparent” about the arrangement and added that people should “move on from that story”. But Kwarteng was unable to say whether Murthy paid tax on foreign earnings in India, of which she is a citizen, or another jurisdiction, such as the Cayman Islands. Murthy receives about £11.5m in annual dividends from a stake in her family’s IT business empire: Infosys. Under UK tax laws, her status as a non-dom means she would not have had to pay tax on the dividend payment from overseas companies. Infosys is headquartered in Bengaluru, India, and listed on the Indian and New York stock exchanges. UK resident taxpayers pay a 38.1% tax on dividend payouts. A spokesperson for Murthy said that because she was a citizen of India, which did not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously, she “is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes”. They added: “She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income.” After Murthy had lived in the UK for 15 years, her non-dom status would fall away, Kwarteng said. Murthy moved to the country in 2015, six years after marrying Sunak. The pair met while studying for a masters in business administration at Stanford University in California. Kwarteng said Murthy had been “very clear” about her non-dom status. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “She’s an Indian citizen. And so she, as you say, pays tax here on UK income, but pays tax abroad on foreign income.” But asked where she paid tax abroad – in India or elsewhere such as the Cayman Islands – Kwarteng said: “I don’t know anything about her tax affairs. “What I do know is that she’s been very clear about the fact that she’s an Indian citizen. Once she’s lived here for 15 years, the non-domicile status falls away. So that will happen in a few years. I don’t know when. “And she’s been very transparent about that. The chancellor has been incredibly transparent in the declaration of interests when he became a minister. “The Treasury, the department which he works in, knows about all those affairs. And there is a measure of transparency and he’s been very honest about that. And I think, as far as I’m concerned, that’s good enough for me. And I think we should move on from that story.” Earlier, Kwarteng told Times Radio that non-domicile status had existed in the UK “for more than 200 years”. He said: “That’s something that’s been well established … I think there’s a lot of malicious attacks on someone who, after all, is a private citizen and is not a politician.” Murthy had previously faced accusations that she was collecting “blood money” dividends from Infosys’s continued operation in Russia despite the invasion of Ukraine. Following mounting pressure, the company last week announced that it was “urgently” closing its office in Russia. Sunak, who has repeatedly called on British companies to pull out of Russia in order to “inflict maximum economic pain” on Putin’s regime, has so far refused to comment on his wife’s 0.93% stake in Infosys.",News/Politics,Kwasi Kwarteng defends non-domicile tax status of chancellor’s wife,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/07/kwasi-kwarteng-defends-non-domicile-tax-status-of-chancellors-wife-akshata-murthy-rishi-sunak
4/7/2022,"Owners of ageing coal-fired power plants would be required to give at least five years’ notice before shutting under a last-minute rule change proposed by Angus Taylor shortly before the federal election is expected to be called. Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, said on Thursday he had written to the Australian Electricity Market Commission asking it to extend the notice period for generators to shut from 3.5 to five years to “safeguard the delivery of affordable, reliable power for consumers”. The proposal was backed by the New South Wales government, but electricity generators and analysts questioned whether it was necessary and suggested it would make little difference if a coal plant was failing or its owner was broke. The proposal, which will now be subject to a formal commission process including two rounds of public submissions, follows announcements that coal plants would close earlier than scheduled as they increasingly struggle to compete with cheaper renewable energy. In the most recent example, Origin Energy announced in February the country’s largest coal-fired power plant, the Eraring station on the shore of Lake Macquarie in New South Wales, would close in 2025, seven years earlier than previously planned. Taylor was not told of Origin’s decision until the night before its announcement. On Thursday, he said the notice period extension was a “critical reform” to ensure the energy industry had enough time to build new generation capacity to replace closing plants. Tristan Edis, from the consultants Green Energy Markets, said the decision made little sense. He said it was already possible to build batteries to replace coal plants in much less than 3.5 years, and he doubted a five-year notice period would be enforceable if there was an early closure due to a plant suffering a catastrophic failure or if the owner became financially unviable. “In those circumstances, how can you make them?” he said. Sarah McNamara, chief executive of the Australian Energy Council, which represents generators, questioned whether the change was needed. She said it could be counterproductive if it forced a company to publish a closure date long before the plant’s operational circumstances were clear. “It should be recognised that generators, like any business operation, are subject to many unknowns and risks that such a rule cannot address. For example, plants may have physical failures or may be required to unexpectedly cease operations due to health and safety or environmental regulations. Company directors also have obligations under the [Corporations Act] in relation to operations that have become unexpectedly uneconomic,” she said. “All of these issues would limit the effectiveness of such a rule.” Taylor was sharply critical of Origin’s announcement in February that it could shut Eraring, a 2,880MW black coal generator, from August 2025. The company said its decision reflected “the rapidly changing conditions in the national electricity market, which are increasingly not well suited to traditional baseload power stations”. It followed AGL announcing it would bring forward the closure of the Bayswater generator in NSW from 2035 to no later than 2033, and its brown coal-fired Loy Yang A plant in Victoria from 2048 to 2045. EnergyAustralia’s Yallourn power plant, also in the Latrobe Valley, will shut in 2028 rather than 2032. The early closure announcements have been prompted by the rapid rise of cheaper renewable energy, which reached more than 30% of grid generation last year and is forecast to hit at least 69% by 2030. At the time, the Australian Energy Market Operator’s chief executive, Daniel Westerman, said NSW would have access to enough electricity generation when Eraring closed due to planned additional capacity, including new transmission and a new battery announced by the state government. On Thursday, the NSW treasurer and energy minister, Matt Kean, said he welcomed Taylor’s proposal. “Building the new electricity infrastructure like pumped hydro and renewable energy zones needed to replace retiring power stations takes many years, and it is important that investors have as much notice as possible to develop these projects,” he said. But Richie Merzian, climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, suggested Taylor had made a “knee-jerk” request for a rule change after being left out of negotiations between Origin and the NSW government over Eraring’s closure. “It is abundantly clear that coal plants are going to accelerate their closures, closing faster than their official retirement dates. If this government was genuine about providing certainty to coal communities, it would develop a national coal closure roadmap rather than attempting to strong-arm coal plants one by one,” he said. “Failure to develop a coal closure roadmap leaves workers and communities without support or a plan for the future.” Through a spokesperson, federal Labor’s climate change and energy shadow minister, Chris Bowen, said “the AEMC sets the rules on these matters and we’ll continue to follow their advice”. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the minor party would push the next government to close all coal plants by 2030. “More coal means more devastating floods and bushfires,” he said. “With the Liberals keeping coal for longer and Labor vowing they won’t close coal fired power stations early, we’re heading for the climate cliff.”",News/Australia news,Angus Taylor in pre-election move to make coal plants give five years’ notice before closing,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/07/angus-taylor-in-pre-election-move-to-make-coal-plants-give-five-years-notice-before-closing
4/7/2022,"Australia’s Human Rights Commission risks having its global accreditation downgraded because of the way the Coalition made key appointments. It is claimed the government bypassed open merit-based selection processes for the appointment of Lorraine Finlay as human rights commissioner in 2021 and Ben Gauntlett as disability discrimination commissioner in 2019. These appointments were cited as concerns in a decision to defer the commission’s accreditation as an A-status institution. The decision by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions reflects feedback over a 10-year period from the commission, which itself concedes “three appointments in this timeframe did not meet the accreditation requirements”. The third was the appointment of former human rights commissioner, now Liberal MP, Tim Wilson in 2013 by the Abbott government. The decision by the global alliance, a partner of the United Nations, noted the commission’s rules allow the attorney-general to determine that a full selection process is not required where the appointment is considered urgent, as in Gauntlett’s case, or the candidate so eminent there would be “little value” in an open process, as in Finlay’s. It noted the attorney-general has written to the commission advising that future appointments would be openly advertised. “However, [GANHRI] is not satisfied that the commitment … is sufficient to indicate that full compliance with the Paris principles standards on selection and appointment will be forthcoming, either in terms of amendments to the existing process or future appointments in practice.” The body also noted the commission’s budget concerns, which have resulted in one in three jobs being slashed. The Human Rights Law Centre’s executive director, Hugh de Kretser, said: “The Morrison government has undermined the independence and effectiveness of the commission, making appointments without a public, merit-based selection process. “The Morrison government’s actions have jeopardised our national human rights watchdog at a critical time for human rights, both at home and globally. “Australia can and should lead the world on human rights. Instead of leading, the Morrison government is embarrassing us on the world stage.” Labor’s Senate leader, Penny Wong, said the development was “very deeply concerning”. “We are a country that has a strong international reputation on human rights,” she told ABC News. “We should not allow that to be eroded.” A final decision on accreditation is expected by October 2023. The commission acknowledged it was “at risk of being downgraded to a B-status … if this issue is not sufficiently addressed within this timeframe”. This is the first time the commission has been at risk of losing its A-status since international standards for national human rights institutions were introduced in 1993. The commission said its president, Rosalind Croucher, has “shared with the government the commission’s concerns over the implications of the deferral and potential risks to the promotion and protection of human rights in Australia, as well as Australia’s reputation internationally”.

Finlay’s appointment was fiercely criticised by then Australian of the Year, Grace Tame, due to Finlay’s concern about affirmative consent laws, while other critics pointed to her Liberal party links, her outspoken views on an Indigenous voice to parliament, and section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Labor’s shadow finance minister, Katy Gallagher told reporters in Canberra that “we have seen and are seeing in the dying days of this government appointments to key positions which affect trust in organisations”. On Monday the Morrison government appointed six people with Liberal links to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, among 19 appointments. Those, and separate jobs for former federal minister John McVeigh and NSW minister Don Harwin, have sparked concerns of a repeat of 2019, when a Guardian Australia analysis found that one in five of those appointed to government bodies in the fortnight before the election was called had Liberal or National party links.",News/Australia news,Australian Human Rights Commission’s status at risk over Coalition’s appointment process,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/07/australian-human-rights-commissions-status-at-risk-over-coalitions-appointment-process
4/7/2022,"Australia needs a royal commission into the Covid response and should consider new laws to crack down on medical misinformation, the Senate’s Covid committee has recommended. In its final report, released on Thursday, the Labor-chaired committee called for greater transparency, including releasing decisions of Australia’s health advisers and the secretive national Covid commission, which called for a gas-led economic recovery. The report found that although “Australia fared much better than other countries” in the first wave of the pandemic, “significant failures” had caused “catastrophic consequences” including more than 6,000 deaths, about 30% in aged care. “This failure to establish stand-alone quarantine facilities resulted in overseas arrival caps being imposed, which severely restricted the number of people able to return to Australia, denying thousands of citizens entry to their own country,” it said. The vaccine rollout “was plagued by the failure to secure enough supply and significant delays which led to every target the government set itself being missed”. “The government has also failed to address the serious and dangerous vaccine misinformation promoted within the government’s own parliamentary ranks.” The committee called for the establishment of a Centre for Disease Control and for the federal government to intervene in the aged care work value case in support of pay rises in the sector – which are both Labor policies. It called for a review of the Therapeutic Goods Administration’s powers “to address health misinformation during public health campaigns or emergency responses”. The committee called for all national Covid commission reports to be made public, including “all declarations of actual and perceived conflicts of interest made by commissioners”; and “all previous and future minutes of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee”. It suggested a “royal commission be established to examine Australia’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic”, in line with calls started by independent senator Rex Patrick and supported by a number of Labor, crossbench and even Coalition senators. Katy Gallagher, the committee’s chair, told reporters in Canberra the royal commission was warranted because the committee had been “prevented” from accessing crucial information. That included national cabinet documents, which the Morrison government claims are cabinet in confidence. Gallagher did not commit Labor, if elected, to setting up a Covid royal commission, noting the Senate report was not opposition policy. When asked about the former Liberal prime minister Tony Abbott’s call for a royal commission in August, Morrison said he would not be “drawn into those things” because “we’re managing the pandemic right now, and this pandemic still has quite a long way to go”. “So I’m sure at some time in the future there’ll be a time to talk about those reviews or whatever form they might take,” he said. On Thursday Gallagher said that Australia was “unprepared” for the pandemic and the federal government “didn’t jump at taking responsibility”. She cited the Morrison government’s failures on “quarantine and vaccines”, which had caused “flow-on consequences”. “We think some of the failures have lengthened the lockdowns, we’ve had significant outbreaks as a result – obviously more cases, and unfortunately more deaths.” In a dissenting report, the Coalition senators said the Australian government had “delivered one of the lowest rates of loss of life and one of the strongest economic recoveries in the world”. Although it started as a bipartisan initiative, Coalition senators said the committee had become “a vehicle in which Labor senators have pursued partisan attacks on the government”. There had been a “remarkably high degree of government cooperation with this committee”, they said.",News/World news,"Australia’s Covid response should be examined by royal commission, Senate inquiry recommends",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/australias-covid-response-should-be-examined-by-royal-commission-senate-inquiry-recommends
4/7/2022,"Amazon sellers have been artificially boosting their products’ influential customer ratings by co-opting positive reviews of unrelated items, a leading consumer magazine has reported. Which? said nine of the 10 highest-rated headphones on Amazon were carrying glowing reviews that were actually for products such as cuddly toys, jigsaw puzzles and umbrellas. They included two that carried the “Amazon’s choice” mark of approval. Which? said the nine were little-known brands, while just one established mark – Bose, which was rated eighth – did not show any signs of review abuse. “Unscrupulous businesses are exploiting weaknesses with Amazon’s review system, leaving shoppers at risk of buying products boosted by thousands of bogus five-star reviews,” said Rocio Concha, the director of policy and advocacy at Which?. The magazine said its study found that the most highly rated headphones available, which had five stars and were marked “Amazon’s choice”, had 40 reviews, none of which referred to headphones. “All of the reviews, including three reviews clearly showing photos of the product, were for ‘plushie’ toys – a ‘cute’ cuddly stuffed animal apparently loved by children and adults alike,” Which? reported. The practice is referred to as merging reviews. Online sellers can legitimately adopt it to gather all reviews for closely related products – such as differing colours of the same model – in one place. But Which? reported that merging reviews for unrelated products was against Amazon’s terms and conditions. Which? said it “focused its investigation on just one popular product category, but has also seen the issue across other categories, including smartphone chargers with reviews for surge protectors, tweezers boosted by reviews for non-stick kitchen foil, and blackhead removing nose strips boosted by reviews for wigs”. Concha said: “Once again, this reinforces the importance of the CMA’s ongoing fake reviews investigation getting to the bottom of the issue and ensuring that major shopping sites are protecting people from these unfair practices. “The government also announced its intention to tackle fake reviews as part of its consumer and competition reforms and should bring forward new laws, in the upcoming Queen’s speech, to banish these exploitative practices as soon as possible.” An Amazon spokesperson told the BBC: “We have now taken appropriate enforcement action against the product listings and sellers in question. “We have clear guardrails in place to prevent products from being incorrectly grouped, either due to human error or abuse. “Our proactive measures detect and block the vast majority of abuse in our store automatically: however, we are disappointed when bad actors evade our system and we will continue to innovate and invest in our tools and processes.”",News/Technology,"Cuddly toy reviews being used to boost headphones on Amazon, says Which?",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/07/cuddly-toy-reviews-being-used-to-boost-headphones-on-amazon-says-which
