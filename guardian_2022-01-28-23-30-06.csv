1/28/2022,"Germany needs to end its reliance on Russian energy and accept that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline was never just a commercial project, the Estonian prime minister has said in an interview conducted against the backdrop of soaring tensions over Ukraine. Kaja Kallas also said she detected a wider debate within Germany about its approach to Russia after Angela Merkel’s departure, and questioned Berlin’s ban on transferring Estonian weapons to Ukraine. The ban favours Russian aggression, Kallas said, since the weapons were intended for Ukraine’s self-defence.  She said she accepted Germany’s right to impose the ban on the transfer of Howitzers on the basis of Germany’s longstanding policy against exporting weapons to conflict zones, but confirmed discussions are still live and the ban may yet be lifted. Kallas, who took office in January 2021, is the daughter of the former prime minister Siim Kallas. Her mother and grandmother spent time in Siberian gulags during the mass Soviet deportations from Estonia during the second world war. In recent weeks she has become one of the most forthright advocates in the west of the argument that Vladimir Putin only responds to shows of strength. She said the Russian president’s demands that Nato returns to its pre-1997 borders put her country’s future at stake. Estonia, in common with the other Baltic states, joined Nato in 2004 and is protected by the alliance’s article 5 joint self-defence clause.   Russia  Army: 280,000, including 2,840 tanks and 6,920 fighting vehicles; 150 Iskander ballistic missiles; 4,684+ artillery; 1,520 surface-to-air batteries.  Navy (just the Black Sea fleet): 6 submarines; 6 warships; 35 patrol ships.  Air force: 1,160 combat planes, 394 attack helicopters, 714 air defence systems. Ukraine Army: 145,000, including 858 tanks and 1,184 fighting vehicles; 90 Tochka ballistic missiles; 1,818 artillery; 75+ surface-to-air batteries.  Navy: 1 warship, 12 patrol and coastal ships.  Air force: 125 combat planes, 35 attack helicopters; 6 medium TB2 drones; 322 air defence systems.  Source: International Institute of Strategic Studies Her longstanding call for extra troops to be posted in Estonia, including substantial US presence, is likely to be answered shortly. A group of five F15s landed in Estonia this week, part of a wider strengthening of Nato’s eastern flank. “It is quite a deterrent if you plan an attack on a country where US troops are based. If a big bully is threatening you, it is good to have big friends,” she said. She said clear signals were now emerging from Germany’s leaders that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany will not go ahead if Russia invades Ukraine and that she wanted the pipeline permanently abandoned. “We have been saying for years that Nord Stream is a geopolitical project not an economic one,” Kallas said. “If you are connected to someone, then the person on the other side of the connection can hurt you. It is not of benefit to Europe, or European energy security. These connections can be destabilising. “We in Europe have been talking about dependence on Russian gas for quite some years already, but if you look at the numbers, the dependence on Russia has been increasing not decreasing. It is a big worry. Europe has to increase its independence from Russian gas. It is so important.” On Estonia’s proposed transfer of German-origin Howitzer weapons to Ukraine she trod carefully, but said it was wrong to think a ban represented a simple contribution to a de-escalation. “Ukraine has no intention of attacking Russia,” she said. “They need arms to protect their country. These are defensive weapons to be used against an aggressor.” She said she was following the debate in Germany closely about its security role and relations with Russia. “We have a new government. Everyone is trying to figure out where it will go. Germany is a big player and Merkel a long-time leader, and everyone knew how she operated and what her positions were. It was more predictable. Any change of government – I would not call it a mess – but there is an interim time before a government starts to run properly.” “This is a broader test for the west and much broader than just Ukraine. Putin only understands strength, and Russia’s goal has always been to divide the west, the EU and Nato.” Kallas said there was a very clear pattern to Russian negotiations and it was best summed up by the former Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko. “He said there are three basic rules of negotiating with the west. First demand the maximum, do not meekly ask, but demand. Second present ultimatums and third do not give one inch of ground because there will always be someone in the west that will offer you something maybe half that you did not previously have. It is so characteristic of how they operate. “We are already discussing what we can offer to de-escalate, and if we do that the west will fall into their trap. Nato has not caused this crisis and is not planning to attack anybody. Nato cannot do anything on its side to de-escalate. We should not take any expensive steps so they end up with something they did not have before.” Kallas said that did not mean she opposed dialogue and that she was happy to see talks about transparency on military capabilities, even if she was “very doubtful that Russia will keep its side”. But she said she saw no sign of concessions being made by Nato in its discussions with Russia. “The level of consultation on the Nato side has been excellent. Being a small country of 1.3 million people, it is easy for the big ones only to consult amongst themselves, and go over our heads, but this has not happened. Overall the level of unity we have shown will have surprised Putin.”",News/World news,‘Germany must end reliance on Russian gas’: Estonian PM on tensions in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/germany-must-end-reliance-on-russian-gas-estonian-pm-on-tensions-in-ukraine
1/28/2022,"As “partygate” continues to threaten Boris Johnson’s premiership, the two rivals most likely to succeed him – Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss – are in a tough spot. Do they pipe up or keep quiet? Show loyalty to the PM, or keep a safe distance? The Guardian looks at what they’ve been up to this week …  Sunak Zero from the chancellor. Not a peep. He last broke cover on 18 January – but that interview came to an abrupt end when he was asked about his support for Johnson. An aide stood in front of the camera. Truss The foreign secretary was everywhere. On Wednesday she did interviews on Sky News, BBC Breakfast, LBC and Radio 4’s Today programme, defending Johnson in a series of tortuous interviews. Sunak Er, no. Zippo from the chancellor. Truss She acknowledged concerning reports, but added: “That shouldn’t diminish the fantastic work that has been done under this government and this prime minister.” Sunak He has taken a distinctly arms-length approach to the boss so far. And at this week’s prime minister’s questions, he did not sit next to Johnson on the frontbench. Truss Not so, the foreign secretary. She arrived a full 15 minutes before the noon session, to ensure she sat next to Johnson. Sunak He has certainly tried. Sources say he is alarmed by speculation Johnson might abandon the rise in national insurance, but he hasn’t said so. He posted on Twitter to deny he was ignoring eye-watering fraud in Covid support. Truss Lots of airtime to talk about Ukraine, but then was castigated for taking a private jet to Australia for official business rather than using a scheduled flight. Sunak “A solo traveller with a small group of people around him” – an unnamed, serving minister quoted by Politico . Truss “Not an iron lady, but a chocolate soldier” – a writer in the Chinese state tabloid the Global Times. Sunak His odds have been shortening – 13/8 with Ladbrokes and 11/8 with William Hill. Truss Hers are drifting … 6/1 with Ladbrokes and 9/2 with William Hill. Sunak Rising, just, if the bookies are anything to go by. A YouGov poll on 10 January of 1,005 Tory members also had 33% wanting him to replace Johnson. Truss It might be time for the foreign secretary to do a few more “fizz with Liz” evenings for wavering MPs. That same poll put her on 25%. Sir John Curtice, a professor of politics at Strathclyde University, told the Daily Express that supporters of Truss would not want to initiate a leadership contest as an early one would suit Sunak.",News/Politics,Sunak v Truss: how PM’s rivals tackled another tough week,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/28/sunak-v-truss-how-pm-boris-johnson-rivals-tackled-another-tough-week
1/28/2022,"Monday Fans of FC Magdeburg clearly have a sense of humour. Back in 2012 when their team was lying bottom of the fourth tier of German football and had gone five successive games without scoring, supporters gathered behind the goal with a banner saying “Don’t worry, we’ll show you where the goal is” and hundreds of large luminous arrows all pointing to the back of the net.  Amazingly it worked, with Magdeburg managing to score, though not, alas, to win, as they managed to concede twice. Still, small steps and all that. I may be impatient, but I felt like doing something similar at Stamford Bridge on Sunday when I watched Spurs lose to Chelsea for the third time in as many weeks – the fourth in total for the season – without scoring a single goal in the process. Worse still, a disallowed goal for a foul on a defender aside, Tottenham only had three shots on target in the entire game, two of which were scuffed straight at the keeper, and never really threatened to score until the 88th minute, when a Harry Kane header was well saved. It wasn’t quite as dismal as my earlier trip to Chelsea for the Carabao Cup, in which I can’t remember us once looking like scoring, but it was still hard going watching Spurs consistently giving away possession and having to endure the home fans singing “It’s happened again.” Which it had. Just as all of us had expected it would. I’ve been going to Stamford Bridge for decades and only once seen Spurs win. Even the players now seem to expect to lose. Nor is the pain necessarily over for the season. It will be sod’s law, if we manage to beat Brighton in the fourth round, that we draw Chelsea in the next round of the FA Cup. Tuesday At the beginning of the week it felt as if all of Westminster was in a state of more or less peaceful limbo, with everyone waiting for the publication of the Sue Gray report. That lasted less than a day before all hell broke loose. First, on Monday night, ITV broke the news of yet another party at Downing Street, in which Carrie Johnson and 30 members of staff had commandeered the cabinet room to surprise Boris with cake and to sing “happy birthday”. Come this morning, the story had moved on, with the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, announcing there would be a police investigation into various parties that took place in Downing Street and Whitehall. Bizarrely, some Boris apologists spun the fact that Johnson was now facing a criminal investigation as good news for him. Almost immediately it was then announced that Gray’s report would not now be published until after the police had concluded their own report. This soon changed to parts of the Gray report that the police weren’t interested in could be published immediately, with the rest withheld, before, later in the afternoon, word slipped out that the entire report could be released after all. Come the evening, though, Downing Street had still not had sight of the report nor said whether it would make the whole thing public when it did. In short, Westminster was in chaos with no one knowing what the hell was going on. The evening ended with Jacob Rees-Mogg on Newsnight pledging his unswerving support to the prime minister no matter what he turned out to have done. Moral relativism was alive and well. Wednesday For years now, I’ve always considered myself to be one of the worst ever financial advisers. Before I cleaned up my act in the later 1980s, I worked for a company whose main business was selling life insurance linked to monthly savings policies, which even I could see were hopelessly bad value for money as they mainly seemed designed to make as much money for the company as possible. When I raised this with my manager, he just shrugged and said it was better for people to be saving something rather than nothing. Not entirely convinced by this, I passed on my doubts to prospective clients, with the result that I hardly sold any policies at all. I even managed to mis-sell myself my own endowment for our mortgage. But it turns out that I might have done some good after all. Last week, my friend Alex reported back on a pension he believes I must have sold him in 1986. Now, it goes without saying that neither of us has any recollection of me selling him this pension, but the dates fit and he can’t think of anyone else who might have sold it to him. Anyway, he must have paid in £50 per month for four months before stopping, presumably on the grounds that by then he had worked out I didn’t have a clue what I was doing and had, in any case, already been fired from the company. Mysteriously though, since then the £200 has grown into a healthy £8,000. More remarkably, Alex found that when he came to draw down the pension it was paying an annuity of £1,000. Quite why it was offering such a generous return, he didn’t ask. In case it was a mistake. So if he had had more faith in the pension and stuck with it, he could have been a made man. If he had just continued to pay in for another four years, he could have got a pension of £10K. So just think what he might have got if he had stuck with it for even longer. I only wish I had been dumb enough to buy one of the pensions I was selling. Thursday With everyone still waiting for the publication of the Sue Gray report, I’ve taken to filling the time by collecting some of the excuses Conservative MPs have been making for Boris Johnson’s behaviour. Less than a month ago, the standard defence of most Tories was to say “Let’s wait to see what Sue Gray finds.” Now everyone who bothers to defend him in public has long since given up pretending that Boris – or The Suspect, as he should be more accurately known – has told the truth and has been busy constructing their own realities. Pride of place goes to the Northern Ireland secretary, Conor Burns, who tried to convince Channel 4 viewers that Johnson had been “ambushed with cake”. That Colin the Caterpillar can be a right bastard. Meanwhile, Andrew Rosindell said it wasn’t as if The Suspect “had robbed a bank”. Imagine having such low expectations of a prime minister. Edward Leigh though it absurd that Johnson might be brought down by a piece of cake when we were on the brink of war. A claim that might have been more compelling if Boris had either been to Ukraine or spent any time negotiating a peaceful solution to the country instead of firefighting a sleaze scandal at home. Theresa Villiers thought it was fine for The Suspect to go to as many parties as he liked because he had been prime minister while the vaccination programme was underway, Mark Jenkinson thought the parties were all a media conspiracy, while Richard Bacon thought lying about what you were doing was too trivial an offence to be worthy of a mention. Crispin Blunt had the most unusual take. He was certain everyone else had been breaking the law, so there was no harm if the prime minister did as well. Way to go, Crispin. Insult the vast majority of people who did obey the law and didn’t see their families. Even when they were dying. Keep it classy. Friday Our dog, Herbie, is now older than me and my wife. In dog years, at any rate. In September he turned 10 and he’s beginning to show his age. He’s still up for a walk every morning and is an enthusiastic chaser of both squirrels and sticks. In the past he would still be quite lively when he gets home, but now he just wants to curl up on the sofa or the bed and nap for the rest of the day. Come the evening, he perks up and dashes round the garden a few times to see if any foxes are about, but he’s then happy to come up to bed when we do. Not for the first time, it has occurred to me that Herbie is showing me how to grow old gracefully. For a start he’s in better shape – he has no signs of arthritis, while I have an artificial knee and a creaky back – and he doesn’t seem to moan or worry at the things he can no longer do. He just gets on with things. I, on the other hand, still miss not being able to go running, despite not having been able to do so for over 10 years. The cross-trainer in the gym just can’t replace the freedom of exercising outdoors. In short, I’m just not that accepting of my limitations. I can see the future and it’s not pretty. There’s no way I am ever getting a Stannah stairlift in the house; I’d rather drag myself upstairs on my hands and knees. I say that now, of course. Watch this space.

1/28/2022,"My dad died two years ago, exposing a sea of secrets and lies. He’d had a degenerative condition, but was totally in denial – and while it was a known excuse for his moods and lack of interest in his family, he did little in his lifestyle to mitigate its effects. After he died, we discovered there was a dominant gene he could have passed to his children. My brother and I have been tested – my sister does not want to be – and my brother was found to be positive.  After I had my genetic test, I was advised to contact our extended family. Thinking I was being honest, I emailed our cousins the information, sharing my brother’s diagnosis paperwork to help them get referrals. Now, my brother is livid that I shared his medical history. I’ve apologised for sharing his information but not for sharing my dad’s. I can’t believe our wider family don’t deserve to know this. A dominant gene is relevant – particularly because it indicates a causal link, but not a definite diagnosis, meaning it could be dormant and be passed down. I’m writing to ask if I did the right thing and how best to move forward. I’m tired of the legacy my father has left behind but I feel like I’m being punished for doing the right thing. I’m sorry to hear about your dad and the legacy he’s left you with. I wonder if you’ve had the results of your test? That must weigh heavily on your mind. But your brother’s testing positive must be a big worry for him, and it sounds, by your own admission, as if that hasn’t been acknowledged. It’s clear that you’re very angry with your dad, and he’s not here to take it. I wonder if you are now misdirecting it. To help me answer you I consulted psychotherapist Katherine Walker (psychotherapy.org.uk) and lawyers Jonathan Wheeler and Amanda Garner from Bolt Burdon Kemp. While Walker empathised with what you were trying to do, we all agreed that sharing your brother’s information without his consent was a no-no. The fact remains you could have satisfied your need for helping others, and sharing the information about the degenerative condition, without involving your brother and certainly without passing on his medical data. As Wheeler and Garner pointed out, passing on his papers without his consent is a breach of data protection laws. Your brother could, if he wanted to, make a complaint about you to the Information Commissioner’s Office, although the chances of it being interested in this (it mainly concerns itself with organisations leaking data) are minimal at best. However, it’s important to realise that what you did was wrong and no amount of justification can make this right. “You need to own what you’ve done and take responsibility for it,” says Walker. “You’re trying to correct the generational pattern and right wrongs of the past, but when we do this we sometimes overcompensate. While you’ve avoided secretive behaviour, you’ve invaded your brother’s privacy in pursuit of the truth.” Walker suggested you try to explain to your brother that you did it with the best intentions but admit that “you went too far and his information wasn’t yours to share”. With a bit of time, you’ll see that a more nuanced approach is best. Discretion and secrecy aren’t the same thing. Also, it’s not up to you to (try to) right your dad’s wrongs. It sounds like your family may have difficult times ahead; I hope you can find a way of supporting each other. Every week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a family-related problem sent in by a reader.

1/28/2022,"Wayne Rooney has said he turned down an interview for the manager’s job at Everton. The club’s former forward has impressed under difficult circumstances at Derby this season and said he had taken the difficult decision to stay. “Everton approached my agent and asked me to interview for the vacant job, which I turned down,” he said.  Rooney added: “I believe I will be a Premier League manager. I believe I’m ready for that, 100%. And if that is with Everton one day in the future that would be absolutely great. But I’ve got a job here that I’m doing at Derby County which is an important job to me.” He admitted he had to think long and hard about the offer. “They got in touch with my agent, my agent let the administrators know as well, and yes of course it was a difficult decision for me [to turn it down],” Rooney said. Everton are giving final interviews to Frank Lampard, Vítor Pereira and Duncan Ferguson on Friday as they decide who should succeed Rafael Benítez. Rooney’s ties to Everton run deep.

1/28/2022,"With solo artists currently dominating the charts and the zeitgeist, now is not the ideal time to be in a band – unless it’s Glass Animals. This week, the Oxford quartet became the first British group to top Spotify’s global songs chart with their synthpop single Heat Waves, racking up 4.26m plays per day on the streaming platform. It was a feat their fans saw coming: last year, Heat Waves was the fourth most-streamed song in the US and the most-streamed in Australia, having been played more than 1bn times worldwide. This is a remarkable achievement for an act with no previous big hits – but that’s not the only strange thing about their success. A sultry, wistful number with an extremely catchy chorus, Heat Waves has had an unusually slow rise to prominence: it was released in June 2020 and for months it failed to break into the UK Top 40 or US Billboard Hot 100. Its subsequent ascent up the charts – peaking at No 5 in the UK, No 1 in Australia and No 3 in the US, where it currently stands – was unprecedented in its leisurely nature; it now holds the record for the longest climb to the Top 5 in the US chart’s history.  Although the band weren’t exactly languishing in obscurity – 2014 single Gooey eventually went platinum in the US despite never actually breaking into the charts, while their 2016 album How to Be a Human Being was nominated for the Mercury prize – even a year ago, it would have been difficult to imagine Glass Animals achieving the popularity they have today. Frontman and songwriter Dave Bayley wrote Heat Waves alone in the spring of 2019 in a recording studio complex in London. Or at least he thought he was by himself – towards the end of his session he turned round to discover Johnny Depp was watching him. The actor, unfortunately, did not spot Heat Waves’ potential. “He literally didn’t react in any way to the song,” recalls Bayley. “He almost spoke to me afterwards as if there had been a fart in the room – something weird and slightly negligible. There was no compliment.” Initially, Bayley wasn’t even sure he wanted to perform the song himself, and attempted to pitch it to another artist. Despite the track’s enormous success, he still thinks it may have worked better in somebody else’s voice. That’s because the subject of the song is so personal he can barely perform it without crying: the bittersweet, nostalgic nature of the chord progression made him think of his best friend who died. Afterwards, he decided to make the lyrics more vague, so it could also apply “to a relationship situation” and appeal to a wider audience. “Songs that are insanely specific, I don’t relate to as much,” he says. Bayley was downbeat about its prospects in the run-up to the track’s release. The band had only just survived a very stressful period: the previous year, drummer Joe Seaward had sustained a serious head injury when his bike collided with a lorry, and for a while it was unclear whether he would walk or talk again. Soon after his recovery – and just as the band were preparing to release their third album, Dreamland – the pandemic hit, plunging them straight back into the doldrums. “I was so worried,” says Bayley. “It immediately felt like there was no space in the world for new music. Everyone was listening to old music, finding comfort in the past. I was floored, for two weeks I just sat in my pants. My managers were like: you just have to put the record out and it’s going to be a dud. Start writing the next one.” In fact, Glass Animals did the opposite. There is no single secret to Heat Waves’ sleeper-hit success – instead there were many minor individual efforts to drum up interest in the song. Bayley himself was behind some of the more off-the-cuff approaches, including an impromptu gig on a Hackney street corner that was cut short when the police “sweetly” notified them that they were standing next to a sign that read “no music”. More successful tactics included releasing the individual audio files from the album online so fans could remix the tracks. Helen Fleming, the band’s marketing manager at their label Polydor, says engaging audiences in such ways is now hugely important: “Fan-created content is becoming more and more fundamental in how music travels so we knew we’d want to lean into that.” A TikTok trend has also helped Heat Waves gain popularity in recent months, with users soundtracking videos about absent loved ones with the song. Bayley describes the trend as “quite sad and sentimental which really fits the song – I’ve seen some other TikTok trends where it’s just someone putting mustard on a watermelon and jumping over milk crates.” But by the time TikTok entered the frame, the song had been building an audience for more than a year thanks to its inclusion on the Fifa 21 soundtrack, its popularity on the video game Minecraft, and TV and radio promotion, says Fleming, meaning it “was primed to explode in the way that it has”. Modern methods aside, both Bayley and Fleming attribute a chunk of Heat Waves’ global popularity to the years Glass Animals spent touring the US, giving them a good foundation in a country where you actually need to be physically present, explains Fleming. Australian acclaim was also crucial. Heat Waves was voted the No 1 song of 2020 in the Triple J Hottest 100, the taste-making radio station’s annual music poll. Bayley thought it was so unlikely that the band would top the chart that he promised to get his first tattoo – an outline of Australia on his bum – if Glass Animals triumphed. He removed the bandages last week. Fleming says her team were also caught off-guard. “At the beginning of the campaign we weren’t talking about the singles chart,” says Fleming. “It’s unusual for a band to break a single in the way Glass Animals have.” It is especially rare for an act with a traditional band set up to have a huge hit single nowadays. Over the past decade, the popularity of such groups has dived, in part due to the dominant cultural forces of pop, electronic music and rap, explains Hannah Ewens, Rolling Stone UK’s features editor. Paradoxically, however, this also may be why Glass Animals have thrived. “Their music doesn’t really sound like guitar music or ‘band’ music,” says Ewens. “It’s fairly close to being what’s been called Spotify-core: quite electronic, catchy, mid-tempo, muted, pensive but neutral in mood. The sort of inoffensive sound that could live on lots of playlists.” Thanks to that broad appeal, Glass Animals’ rise looks set to be exponential. The band are currently awaiting next month’s Brit awards – where they are up for song of the year and best rock act – and the Grammys, where they have scored their first nomination, for best new artist. In the meantime, Bayley is taking some time off from Glass Animals, but not music-making. He is currently working with Jae5, best known for producing rapper J Hus’s work, as well as a female artist he cannot name, but who he describes as “one of my favourite songwriters of our generation”. Collaborating, he thinks, is “the best way to learn: to see how other people work, and steal their tricks.” After Heat Waves’ success, he may need to closely guard his own.",Arts/Music,‘Our managers were like: it’s going to be a dud’: how Glass Animals became the biggest British band in the world,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/28/our-managers-were-like-its-going-to-be-a-dud-how-glass-animals-became-the-biggest-british-band-in-the-world
1/28/2022,"When the poet Mary Oliver wrote “Instructions for living a life,” she reminded us: “Pay attention. Be astounded. Tell about it.” This past autumn, wildlife officials announced that a bird, a male Bar-tailed Godwit, flew non-stop across the Pacific Ocean 8,100 miles from Alaska to Australia in just under 10 days. Fitted with a small solar-powered satellite tag, the godwit achieved “a land bird flight record.” But of course godwits have been doing this for centuries. Come next April-May, all things well, determined godwits will make the trip in reverse, bound for Alaska to nest and raise their young.  They won’t be alone. Northern Wheatears, songbirds less than six inches long, will arrive in Alaska from sub-Saharan Africa. Arctic Terns will return from Antarctica, with each bird flying the equivalent of three trips to the moon and back in a single lifetime. Bar-headed Geese will fly over the Himalayas at altitudes exceeding 20,000 feet. PT Barnum was wrong. The circus is not the greatest show on earth. Nature is. How diminished our world would be without birds, those dinosaurs with feathers and songsmiths with wings. Not that I was born John James Audubon. I used to ignore birds, and was poorer for it. Once, in my teens, while out with my .22 rifle, I spotted a Red-tailed Hawk riding a July thermal. I aimed and fired, and watched it drop from the sky. Stunned, I ran to it and found it thrashing in the dry summer grasses, dying. I walked away, fell to my knees, and threw up. Now, decades later, I love birds – how they bring me joy and give me wings; how they enlarge my world, slow me down, make me listen. In every hawk I see a velociraptor. In every thrush I hear exquisite music. In every swallow I witness an aerial dance as they snap insects in midair. In every epic migration I find myself redefining what’s possible. And always the same question arises: can we, the human race, in all our commerce and carbon-burning, somehow save our winged cousins? In the past half century, North America has lost more than one-fourth of its birds. Nearly everywhere, they are in decline. Massive die-offs of flycatchers, swallows, bluebirds, sparrows and warblers – described as thousands of birds “falling out of the sky” – have been recorded in recent years in New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Arizona and Nebraska. Smoke from intense California fires forced Tule Geese to re-route their migration and take twice as long. Elsewhere, as birds lay their eggs earlier, due to a warming climate, more chicks die from sudden inclement weather events. This is where we find ourselves, trapped in a diminished world of our own making. Today only 30% of all birds are wild; the other 70% are mostly poultry chickens. In essence, Earth is now a coal mine, and every wild bird is a canary – what ecologists call a “bio-indicator” – in that mine. Their fate is ours. Soon after news broke of the flight of the godwit, the US Fish and Wildlife Service announced newly extinct species including the Ivory-billed Woodpecker and Bachman’s Warbler. “When the last individual of a race of living things breathes no more,” the naturalist William Beebe once observed, “another heaven and another earth must pass before such a one can be again.” The author and climate crisis activist Kathleen Dean Moore writes, “Unless the world acts to stop extinctions, I will write my last nature essay on a planet that is less than half as song-graced and life-drenched as the one where I began to write.” Of all the species that have ever existed, more than 99% are now gone, most having winked away during five major extinction events, the last caused by an asteroid that struck Earth some 66m years ago. Today, given global habitat loss (especially deforestation and prairies turned into cropland) and wide-spread persistent toxins, we – modern humans – are the asteroid. The sixth mass extinction is here, with about 600 species of North American birds at risk from human-caused climate change. We must safeguard one of nature’s greatest creations: wild birds. Build a better world for them, and we’ll build one for ourselves. We must defend a livable planet by electing politicians who have empathy and an ecological conscience. Vote blue, act green. Restore native habitats and environmental health. Keep domestic cats indoors, and affix silhouetted hawk decals to windows. In the US alone, an estimated three to four billion birds die each year from cat predation and window strikes. Put a birdfeeder out the window of a nursing home and watch the patients inside brighten. Birds bring happiness and improved health. A European study suggests that a backyard full of birds creates greater human satisfaction than a modest pay raise. Our survival and mental well-being are intricately tied to that of healthy lands, waters and biodiversity; nothing proves it better than wild birds. In August 2020, as the Trump administration sought to weaken the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty Act, a federal judge ruled in favor of the Act and quoted Harper Lee’s famous novel: “It is not only a sin to kill a mockingbird, it is also a crime.” I celebrated the ruling. Later, in 2021, when the Biden administration reinstated and strengthened the Act, I took a walk along the ocean near my home, binoculars (not a gun) in hand, and felt a deep sense of gratitude – even hope – knowing that more than tens of thousands of people around the world would volunteer in the annual Christmas Bird Count, a century-old tradition to pay attention, be astounded, and share stories about birds. Godwits might come to mind, and Mary Oliver’s poem “Wild Geese”: Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,the world offers itself to your imagination,calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting –over and over announcing your placein the family of things.

1/28/2022,"With lunar New Year being celebrated next week, there’s a chance you might be having a Chinese meal over the next few days, but I wonder what you’re planning to drink with it. Wine-wise, at least, the same suspects – usually off-dry whites such as riesling and gewürztraminer – tend to get trotted out all the time, so I was particularly interested that this week’s guest contributor Amy Poon and her husband, Michael, who happens to work in the wine business, suggested some different options to go with her recipes. With the wok-roasted char siu, they went for a Saint-Estèphe, suggesting Château Capbern (Laithwaites, 15%), Château Meyney (Majestic, 13.5%) “to balance the rich, smoky flavours of the pork” (though, at £28 and £35.99, respectively, neither is what you’d call cheap), or a traditional Loire red such as a chinon or bourgeuil. And for her father’s classic zha jiang noodles, they recommend a rosé champagne or an English sparkling wine such as the Woodchester Valley in today’s pick.  It depends, of course, on the type of Chinese food you’re eating. Supermarkets are still relatively conservative with their ready meals, so if you’re having sweet-and-sour chicken or chow mein, riesling might well be the answer, after all. But there are many dishes with which you could drink a red – the Chinese themselves are particularly keen on bordeaux, and in recent years have invested heavily in the region. Given that a range of dishes may be on the table at the same time, I find it most helpful to look at the overall style of the food, rather than individual dishes. If you’re having dim sum or delicate seafood dishes, for example, crisp, dry whites such as pouilly-fumé or sparkling wines tend to work best. Fizz is also good with anything deep-fried such as spring rolls and prawn toast. With more savoury, umami-rich dishes such as duck or braised meats, on the other hand, I’d definitely be inclined to drink a red. As well as bordeaux, I like a good pinot noir, although with the likes of beef in black bean sauce, I’d go for a bolder red such as a grenache. Meanwhile, with spicy dishes – mapo tofu or a chilli-spiked hotpot, say – I’d be more likely to drink the very forgiving grüner veltliner below , or a lager. And if you’re on the last couple of days of dry January, the 0.5% Lucky Saint would hit the spot. Another good alcohol-free option is sparkling tea, which I’ve mentioned before. I’ve just come across a delicious limited-edition one from Saicho called Eight Treasures. At £32.99 a bottle, it’s definitely not cheap, but it is made from a rare oolong and is beautifully packaged, so it’s ideal for a New Year gift. Woodchester Valley Brut Rosé 2018 £28.95 Woodchester Valley, 12.5%. Deliciously fruity, with a heady aroma of freshly picked strawberries and raspberries (so a good choice for Valentine’s Day, too). Château Jouanin Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux 2019 £9 larger Co-ops, 13.5%. An appealingly soft, fruity bordeaux that would work really well with crispy duck pancakes. Rainer Wess Grüner Veltliner Kremstal 2020 £9.95 The Wine Society, 12.5%. Austria’s grüner veltliner is a really versatile white that could take you through a whole range of dishes.

1/28/2022,"Archant, the publisher of dozens of titles including the Eastern Daily Press, London’s Ham & High Express and the former owner of the anti-Brexit weekly the New European, is up for sale just 18 months after being sold to a private equity group. The Norwich-based newspaper group, one of Britain’s oldest publishers co-founded in 1845 by the mustard magnates the Colman family, was sold to the investment group Rcapital in August 2020 in a deal that promised a “bright future” for the company as the pandemic accelerated the decline in its already strained finances.  Rcapital, which during its short period of ownership sold the New European to a consortium including the former New York Times chief and BBC director general Mark Thompson and the ex-Financial Times editor Lionel Barber, has put out an information memorandum to prospective buyers and is understood to have appointed Ulmus Advisory to oversee the process. It is understood that interest has been expressed by several groups including National World – the owner of more than 100 local and regional titles including the Scotsman and Yorkshire Post – which lost out to Rcapital when Archant was sold. Newsquest, the UK’s second biggest regional player with 200 titles, including the Argus in Brighton, Northern Echo in Darlington and Glasgow’s Evening Times, has also expressed interest. Reach, the owner of the Mirror, Star and Express national papers and almost 200 regional print and digital titles including the Manchester Evening News and Liverpool Echo is another potential suitor. The involvement of Reach, which has the largest combined online readership of any UK newspaper group and in December overtook the BBC as the biggest news website by audience, could cause regulatory issues. While the publisher does not own print titles that overlap with Archant, which also owns about 75 specialist magazines such as London Bride and Pilot, it has made a big investment in the region launching the competing digital brands NorfolkLive and SuffolkLive backed by 50 journalists as part of plans to launch local news brand in every county in England and Wales. If Reach were to succeed, the company has the deepest pockets to make a bid, it could trigger media plurality concerns with the industry regulator Ofcom. Like other regional publishers, Archant has been hit by the growing shift of readers and advertisers to digital platforms. The company makes about £50m in annual revenues, down from almost £100m in 2017, and is barely profitable. It is expected to be sold for about £5m to £10m, the same price range as National World paid for JPI Media in December 2020, a business that was sold for £160m by the Barclay brothers in 2005. When Rcapital announced its takeover of Archant it described the deal as a “one-of-a-kind” investment. The private equity group owns 90% of Archant, with 10% owned by the Pension Protection Fund, as part of a company voluntary arrangement to unburden Archant from its pension and life assurance scheme.",News/Media,Newspaper group Archant up for sale 18 months after private equity buyout,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/28/newspaper-group-archant-up-for-sale-18-months-after-private-equity-buyout
1/28/2022,"Theresa May has made her first intervention in the row over Downing Street parties, saying she was angry to hear about them. The former prime minister, who has frequently criticised Boris Johnson on other issues, has been conspicuously silent in the weeks since the “partygate” allegations first emerged at the end of November.  Now, however, she has said that if evidence were to emerge of deliberate wrongdoing then “full accountability” should follow and that “nobody is above the law”. In a letter to her local newspaper, the Maidenhead Advertiser, she wrote: “It is vital that those who set the rules, follow the rules … This is important for ensuring the necessary degree of trust between the public and government. “Like so many, I was angry to hear stories of those in No 10, who are responsible for setting the coronavirus rules, not properly following the rules. All those working at the heart of government should conduct themselves with the highest of standards which befits the work they do, and this applies as much to those working in No 10 as to other parts of government.” The letter was sent before the Metropolitan police launched an inquiry into alleged parties after receiving evidence from Sue Gray, the senior official who has been asked by Downing Street to investigate possible Covid rule-breaking in Whitehall. May said that “if there is evidence of deliberate or premeditated wrongdoing, I expect full accountability to follow”. News of May’s intervention came as it emerged that key parts of Gray’s report into the parties could be pared back at the request of the police. Scotland Yard revealed it had asked for references to matters it was now investigating to be removed. Johnson’s resignation from May’s cabinet was seen as one of the blows to her authority that led to her leaving No 10 in 2019. She has since been a vocal critic of her successor, making a number of sharp interventions in the Commons and the media. She accused him last year of abandoning Britain’s “position of global moral leadership” by threatening to break international law during Brexit trade negotiations. She also attacked the government’s decision to cut foreign aid, saying it had “turned its back on some of the poorest in the world”, and she dismissed government assurances on post-Brexit security arrangements as “utter rubbish”.",News/Politics,‘Nobody is above the law’: Theresa May wades into Downing Street parties row,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/28/theresa-may-wades-into-row-over-downing-street-parties
1/28/2022,"Many will know John Patrick Shanley’s 2004 parable from the Oscar-nominated film adaptation with towering performances by Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman. This taut production walks out from under its long shadow to dazzle with its own invention. Father Flynn (Sam Spruell) has been seen alone with 12-year-old new boy Donald Muller in a school governed by nuns. Altar wine has been drunk. The principal, Sister Aloysius (Monica Dolan), is sure some wrongdoing must have occurred between the priest and the boy and so begins her campaign to unearth the truth and take Father Flynn down.  Shanley’s script harkens back to a 1960s Catholic corner of the Bronx in New York but like all good parables, its story feels both timeless and more timely than ever, its ideological arguments speaking to our world of social media silos and Punch and Judy political debates. In a production directed by Lia Williams, intention and truth stay opaque – it is not only the Sister’s tyranny of certitude that is complicated but also the Father’s silver-tongued sermonising on doubt. Is she smoking out the truth or clinging to absolutes in a fast-changing world? Is he mobilising arguments in an effort to escape blame? Each character’s cards are played close to their chest and the performances elevate themselves beyond any comparisons with the film. Dolan brings an unsettling humour and swagger to her role. She is not a likable character – and not as seemingly reasonable as the Father – but that does not make her position wrong. “It is my job to outshine the fox,” she says, and she could be Miss Marple in a habit – gimlet-eyed, ever suspicious, performing Catholic duty to the letter and seeing heresy even in Frosty the Snowman. There is something magnificently rebellious about Dolan’s portrayal: she is never going to win against a “man in a robe”, says Mrs Mueller when she visits the school to talk about her son’s apparent abuse. But the Sister squares up to a patrician church and its nakedly patriarchal power structures, even as Father Flynn pulls rank, telling her what women can’t do in the church and threatening to get her fired. Spruell is equally magnificent, by turns beseeching, vulnerable, explosive and entitled, at once both victim and arch manipulator who talks to schoolboys about making sure to keep their nails clean, as if appearance is all. “Children need warmth”, he says, and the drama’s ground constantly shifts between his truth and hers. Their confrontations are bare-teethed and full of Pinteresque savagery, while the two ancillary characters, Sister James (Jessica Rhodes) and Mrs Muller (Rebecca Scroggs) bring added moral complications and controlled, compelling performances. Joanna Scotcher’s extraordinary set is bleached of colour, almost Amish in its starkness, and has a gothicism that emanates from a gigantic cross created out of slivers of cross-hatched light against a wall of thunderous black. In an almost mischievous touch, there is a single bare-branched tree that could be from the forgotten landscape of Waiting for Godot. The lack of an interval makes the play all the more powerful, without seeming too hurtling. Actors pace themselves but sustain every moment of dramatic tension. The grey gulf between Sister Aloysius and Father Flynn’s entrenched positions is where the audience are left to swim. The play leaves us, unnervingly, in that place of doubt.

1/28/2022,"France’s far-right leader Marine Le Pen has described her niece’s decision not to support her presidential campaign as “brutal, violent and painful”. Marion Maréchal, who dropped Le Pen from her name in 2018, said she was considering whether to transfer her allegiance to Éric Zemmour, who is even further to the right.  In an interview with Le Parisien, Maréchal, who at 22 became the youngest MP in the Assemblée Nationale in 2012, before stepping down in 2017, said her aunt’s “incessant ideological and programme changes” showed a “lack of logic and vision”. On potentially backing Zemmour, she said: “I’m thinking about it. I haven’t decided. If I support Éric, [it] would not just be a question of passing by and saying hello. It would mean returning to politics. It’s a real life choice, a heavy decision.” On Friday Marine Le Pen, who has spearheaded efforts to “de-demonise” her party, now called National Rally (RN – Rassemblement National), appeared shocked by Maréchal’s decision, describing it as a personal as well as a political blow. “I have a special relationship with Marion because I raised her with my sister during the first few years of her life, so obviously it’s brutal and violent … it’s difficult for me,” she told CNEWS television. She also expressed her “incomprehension” of the politics behind the decision. “I didn’t really expect it. She [Maréchal] indicated she would support the candidate that is best placed to reach the second round. Undoubtedly, I am better placed than Éric Zemmour is today.” A rift within the family has been widening for more than a decade. After Marine Le Pen took control of what was then the Front National in 2011, she fell out with her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, the party founder, and later expelled him. In recent weeks she has lost two former close allies to Zemmour. In 2017 Maréchal said she was leaving politics to set up a private university teaching conservative political studies in Lyon. Opinion polls suggest Emmanuel Macron, who has not yet declared he will stand but is expected to seek re-election, will win through to the second round to face either Le Pen or the mainstream-right Les Républicains candidate, Valérie Pécresse. Last week Le Pen described Zemmour’s anti-migration programme as “extremely brutal”. “Does he want to be in the second round – I don’t believe so – or is he in fact a stepping stone to allow Valérie Pécresse to be in the second round in place of Marine Le Pen?” she said.",News/World news,Le Pen feud deepens as French far-right leader’s niece withdraws support,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/le-pen-feud-deepens-french-far-right-leader-niece-withdraws-support
1/28/2022,"In the lead-up to the Beijing Winter Olympics there have been two major side issues unrelated to sport: Covid, and human rights protests. Chinese authorities have implemented an ambitious “closed loop” system to try to keep the Games free of a coronavirus outbreak, or at least keep any outbreaks away from the general population. When it comes to protests, authorities have put in a great deal of effort to contain them. Below we look at what issues may arise during the Games, and how authorities could react.  “Athletes must be aware that the information they provide on their visa applications has been used to create files and open-source collection efforts on them,” Nicholas Eftimiades, a US academic and former intelligence official, wrote for the Diplomat. “That research effort identifies and places athletes into at least two categories: first, those who have espoused public views that the CCP [Chinese Communist party] deems threatening … and second, those that have made public statements in support of China.” Mobile phone tracking, CCTV systems and facial recognition technology would also be used, he said. A mandatory app called MY2022 requires all those attending to upload personal and health information and report daily. It allows encryption protecting users’ voice audio and file transfers to be “trivially sidestepped”, according to Citizen Lab, it does not make clear who can access the information, and it also contains a feature allowing users to report “politically sensitive” content. Citizen Lab also discovered a series of online search terms earmarked for potential censorship, raising questions about promises made by the Chinese authorities of access to a less restricted internet for foreigners attending. The terms relate to topics including Xinjiang, Tibet, the Tiananmen Square massacre, insults against China and its leaders, but also included neutral references to Chinese government agencies and figures. Opinion among activists is split on whether athletes should use their platform during the Olympics to protest against the Chinese government’s human rights abuses. Some, such as the director of the Tibet Action Institute, Lhadon Tethong, have appealed to them as “perhaps the most privileged and protected group in the world in China” to use the historic moment and speak out. Others, including former Olympians and human rights groups, have advised that it may be safer to wait until they are on home soil, citing a warning from Chinese officials that behaviour that breaks Chinese rules or laws would lead to “certain punishment”. “I personally think it’s unlikely [an athlete would be punished] during the Olympics, but then again they detained the two Michaels [Spavor and Kovrig], and other prominent foreigners,” said William Nee, of Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD). “Every year they get incrementally more repressive and less concerned with international opinion.” He said there was also the risk that an act of protest sparks a nationalistic reaction from Chinese people, which would force the government to respond strongly, particularly if it targeted Xinjiang, Tibet or Hong Kong. In 2008 Beijing authorities designated three “demonstration zones” where permitted protests could take place. In reality no permits were approved and at least one activist was reportedly arrested after applying. This time around authorities “don’t even want to pretend”, said Teng Biao, a US-based human rights activist and University of Chicago scholar. “A few days ago the Chinese Olympic officials said athletes can’t say something which is against Chinese law. That’s sheer intimidation of athletes. I think it’s not possible to have some kind of demonstration zone.” Sui Muqing, a Chinese human rights lawyer, said anyone who might protest was likely to be monitored. “The probability of protests during the Olympics is not high because the Chinese authorities attach great importance to major events, [and implement] social stability maintenance and control measures.” Before major sensitive events such as the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, authorities in China often send dissidents and activists on enforced holidays to home villages for the duration, or, in more extreme cases, detain them. Human rights activists say this is happening for the Olympics. Several activists point to the recent detention of two prominent activists, the lawyer Xie Yang and the writer Yang Maodong, and note that the human rights lawyer Tang Jitian has not been heard from since early December. Authorities have also reportedly restricted WeChat accounts. The Beijing Games have been the subject of a large boycott campaign calling for sponsors to dissociate themselves over China’s human rights abuses, particularly those against Uyghurs in Xinjiang. None have dropped out and the major sponsors are not responding to press queries, but there is a distinct lack of the big Olympic-themed promotions that normally appear this close to the opening ceremony. Burton, a snow gear company that is not a sponsor but does operate in Xinjiang, granted an interview to the BBC but it did not go very well for them. Many of the recent boycott campaigns have focused on the use of cotton sourced from Xinjiang, where there are widespread allegations of forced labour, among other abuses. Last week the IOC said no forced labour was used in the making of Olympic uniforms, after concerns were raised by the US congressional committee on China. Sporting stars are generally not so involved in politics and protests, but last year the case of the Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai proved a large exception. Peng disappeared from public view for weeks after she posted an essay to Weibo describing an alleged sexual assault by a former senior official with whom she had previously had a secret relationship. Athletes and activists have continued to publicly voice their concerns – most recently at the Australian Open – about Peng’s wellbeing. But inside China the topic of Peng remains completely censored. There are big questions now on whether foreign athletes will raise her case while on Chinese soil, and if they do, who will see it. Nee said the censorship was still there, and we were unlikely to see an appearance by Peng “if they can get away with it”. The International Olympic Committee has largely backed Beijing’s claim that Peng is under no control or duress, and has said its president, Thomas Bach, will meet her during the Games.",Sport/Sport,Winter watch: how China might keep a tight Olympic grip,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/28/winter-watch-how-china-might-keep-a-tight-olympic-grip

His pose appears momentary, as if he’s about to rush off, and this adds to the sense of energy and dynamism he projects. He also seems to be sharing a joke or conversation with the painter. Although the title reflects the latest theory about his identity, he lives forever as a mystery man, at once social and secretive, communicating in his alert self-consciousness the complexity of the self.

1/28/2022,"Russia has not yet decided whether to attack Ukraine but is prepared to do so, the head of Germany’s foreign intelligence service has said, amid soaring tensions about the Kremlin-ordered military buildup. “I believe that the decision to attack has not yet been made,” Bruno Kahl told Reuters.  The German assessment comes after the US president, Joe Biden, told his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Thursday there was “a distinct possibility that the Russians could invade Ukraine in February”, according to a national security council spokesperson. Tensions have escalated as more than 100,000 Russian troops have massed at the border with Ukraine. On Friday, Russia again rejected claims it was seeking conflict. “If it depends on Russia, then there will be no war. We don’t want wars. But we also won’t allow our interests to be rudely trampled, to be ignored,” Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told Russian radio stations. On Thursday, Lavrov said the US and Nato had provided “no positive reaction” to Kremlin proposals to rewrite the post cold-war security architecture that would effectively give Moscow a sphere of influence in eastern Europe. Russia has promised to meet senior officials from Ukraine, Germany and France in Berlin in February, keeping alive fragile hopes of a diplomatic solution. On Friday, Emmanuel Macron was due to speak to Vladimir Putin about European security and the escalating crisis. The French president has long called for dialogue with Russia, sometimes angering other EU member states that have preferred a more distanced approach. EU divisions rose to the surface after Latvia’s defence minister, Artis Pabriks, made a no-holds-barred attack on the German government for what he called its “immoral” refusal to allow Estonia to ship German-origin guns to Ukraine. In an interview with the FT, Pabriks said: “If a person is walking in a dark alley and somebody is being beaten up and I’m saying ‘once you’re beaten up I’ll call an ambulance’, it’s not proper.” His comments attracted scathing criticism from the veteran German Green MEP Reinhard Bütikofer. “That’s the way to go, Latvia! Let’s turn Nato and the EU into a circular firing squad. That will teach [Vladimir] Putin and Xi [Jinping] a lesson. Right?” he wrote on Twitter, specifying it was a “sarcasm tweet”. Germany has ruled out shipping weapons abroad, citing its own past, a stance upheld by the foreign minister and Green party co-leader, Annalena Baerbock, on Thursday. Meanwhile, EU officials say there has been an increase in pro-Kremlin disinformation since last autumn. “The last week of November is give or take the time when we started seeing again – as was the case in spring last year – intensified rhetoric and more aggressive rhetoric,” an EU official said. Pro-Kremlin outlets, which EU sources describe as “machines of content” have made numerous claims, depicting Ukraine as a tool or toy of the west. Some of the more lurid stories have claimed the Ukrainian government is running a campaign of terror equivalent to Nazi rule, or that western governments are plotting a “false flag” chemical attack on the Donbas region of Ukraine. A second EU official said sometimes the strategy appeared to be to “throw mud at the wall and see what sticks”. Other times it was “outright false stories, sometimes narratives with a grain of truth, sometimes decontextualised issues … but the important thing is this is a clearly coordinated, connected – and from our perspective – intentional use of these elements.” Many of the stories emanate from comments or interviews with Russian officials, such as the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. Outlets include websites and news agencies, such as Sputnik and Ria-Novosti, which have published these stories in several EU languages including Polish, Lithuanian and Spanish. While western capitals are increasingly alarmed about the drift to war, Ukraine’s government has sought to play down the threat. The Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said on Friday that the total number of Russian troops near the border was about 130,000, a number comparable to Moscow’s military buildup in spring 2021, when it eventually pulled its forces back after massive military exercises. “We haven’t observed any events or actions of military character that significantly differ from what was going on last spring,” with the exception of the deployment to Belarus, Reznikov said.

1/28/2022,"Ambitions are high and talk is cheap in January, before the bike racing season has truly got going. However, when Tom Pidcock says that a win in Sunday’s world cyclo-cross championship might be the first step in a hat-trick of world titles this year, it’s far more than mere motivational talk. At 22, the Yorkshire racer’s career has already been so prolific, his improvement curve so steeply inclined, that it’s hard to be sceptical. First up, Sunday, when Pidcock will start as favourite in the cyclo-cross in Fayetteville, Arkansas, hoping to add to his junior title from 2017 and his under-23 rainbow jersey from 2019. He came close to winning twice last weekend in his final warm-up races and believes he will kick on this week. “I’d come off a big block of training and didn’t back off going into the races, it wasn’t exactly what I’d planned but it wasn’t a big issue. After a bit of rest and getting over the jet lag I’ll be good this weekend.”  Cyclo-cross was something of a Cinderella discipline in the UK until the last few years when fields in local races have grown drastically, competitors drawn by a sport which is traffic free and accessible, if far from easy. A cyclo-cross is a brief, intense circuit race, run off road on courses devised to challenge the riders’ bike handling, with multiple dog-leg corners, jumps, off-camber sections and stairs. In wet weather, the courses become a mudbath, with the racers forced to run with their bikes. “It’s low profile, certainly in the UK,” Pidcock said. “But it’s growing. It’s the most difficult thing I do – the weather, the physical aspect, how intense it is and how much you have to concentrate. You’re flat out mentally. At Christmas I did four in five days, and it’s harder than a five-day stage race.” The course in Fayetteville is, Pidcock believes, less technical than most – “super-fast” with a long climb which should be in his favour, and only a single set of stairs. The discipline’s heartland is in the Netherlands and Belgium, where winter races drew huge, paying crowds in the pre-Covid era. There is generous start money for the biggest stars, notably the duo who have dominated cross in recent years and gone on to make headlines at the Tour de France: Wout van Aert of Belgium and Dutch rider Mathieu van der Poel. Both are absent on Sunday – Van Aert because he wishes to prepare fully for the road race season; Van der Poel with a nagging back injury – which can only enhance Pidcock’s chances. There are two ways of seeing this, as Pidcock recognised this week. “For sure they are the best,” he said of his absent rivals. “It’s an opportunity to take, but there’s always going to be that cloud, that they weren’t there. If I can win this year, I can focus on beating them next year. It’s a blessing, but not good at the same time.” With Van Aert and Van der Poel absent, Pidcock’s biggest rivals will be the Belgian Eli Iserbyt – who controversially beat him into silver in the 2017 European under-23 championship – and the Dutchman Lars van der Haar, who is 30 and took the first of his three elite medals in 2013, when Pidcock had yet to reach the junior ranks. “I’ve probably got the biggest engine, on this course the climb is so long that it plays into my hands,” Pidcock said. In the morning’s women’s race, most eyes will be on the evergreen all-rounder Marianne Vos of the Netherlands, now 34 and aiming for an eighth title. Or at least her 12th medal since her first in 2006. After Fayetteville, Pidcock plans to race a full Classics season this spring and the Giro d’Italia for the Ineos team. He will then target the mountain bike world championship in July and the world road race championship in late September. Given he is already Olympic mountain bike champion – having won last year in Tokyo – and finished sixth in last year’s world road race in Leuven, the magic hat-trick is not an unrealistic goal. “Possibly,” is his verdict. “I was a little bit worried about the road race World’s – that it wouldn’t really suit me and I was thinking whether or not I’d go. But it seems to have quite a lot of climbing, 4,500m, if that’s true that’d be good for me.” Pidcock’s Olympic title last July was just the latest phase in perhaps the most meteoric rise any British cyclist has enjoyed in recent years, taking in a plethora of national titles, two world junior championships, both the junior and the U23 Paris-Roubaix, two U23 world mountain bike titles, and a seamless transition to road racing as a professional at just 21. You can look at his goals for this year and contend that he is aiming high; you observe his record and it’s clear he has every right to do so.",Sport/Sport,Tom Pidcock eyes world cyclo-cross glory to maintain his meteoric rise,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/28/tom-pidcock-eyes-world-cyclo-cross-glory-to-maintain-his-meteoric-rise
