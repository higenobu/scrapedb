2/25/2022,"Cyber experts have identified a new strain of computer-disabling malware unleashed on Ukrainian targets as part of Russia’s offensive, as the UK government and banks said they were on alert for online attacks. Russia has been widely expected to launch a cyber assault alongside its military campaign and the run-up to theinvasion of Ukraine was marked by the deployment of a “wiper” virus. A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, which paralyses websites by bombarding them with spurious information requests, also hit Ukrainian government sites.  On Wednesday, ESET Research Labs, a Slovakia-based cybersecurity company, said it had detected a new piece of data-wiper malware on hundreds of machines in Ukraine. ESET said large organisations had been affected, while security experts at Symantec’s threat intelligence team said the malware had affected Ukrainian government contractors in Latvia and Lithuania and a financial institution in Ukraine. ESET has called the malware, which renders computers inoperable by stopping them from rebooting, HermeticWiper. The NotPetya attack of 2017, which devastated Ukrainian businesses, was a wiper attack that encrypted computers irretrievably and spilled over into other countries, causing $10bn (£7.5bn) of damage worldwide. Alexi Drew, a senior analyst at RAND Europe, a research institute, said cyber offensives carried the risk of escalating rapidly. “There’s a history of cyber-attacks not staying where they’re meant to go. If you look at NotPetya, the splash damage there was significant. There is a danger here of escalation because offensive cyber activity is fundamentally not very good at staying where you put it.” Priti Patel said officials were on alert for cyber-attacks and disinformation campaigns from Moscow. “As we monitor developments, we will be especially mindful of the potential for cyber-attacks and disinformation emanating from Russia,” the home secretary said. The chief executive of Lloyds Bank, Charlie Nunn, said on Thursday the lender was on “heightened alert … internally around our cyber risk controls and we’ve been focused on this for quite a while”. Preparation for potential cyber-attacks was discussed in a meeting between the government and banking industry leaders on Wednesday, Nunn added. According to Symantec, the wiper attack that hit Ukraine this week had been planned for some time. One Ukrainian organisation suffered an initial hack in December last year that was related to the recent attack. DDoS attacks were also deployed ahead of the military offensive in order to spread confusion, according to the US cybersecurity firm Mandiant. In a DDoS attack, websites are deluged with vexatious requests for information and become unreachable. The targets on Wednesday included the Ukrainian defence ministry and PrivatBank, Ukraine’s largest commercial bank. “It’s not so much the technical disruption, it’s what it does to undermine confidence, like in the financial sector. It gets people quite nervous. It’s more that kind of secondary impact,” said Jamie Collier, a Mandiant consultant, who described a DDoS as akin to stuffing a thousand envelopes through a letterbox every second. However, Dr Lennart Maschmeyer at the Center for Security Studies at the Swiss university ETH Zurich, said Russia’s cyber strategy so far seems more improvised. “A plausible scenario for more devastating cyber-attacks was that Russia had planned this invasion for a long time, and prepositioned implants across Ukraine’s critical infrastructure in order to cause mass disruptions coinciding with the military invasion. That does not seem to be the case. The cyber operations we have seen do not show long preparation, and instead look rather haphazard,” he said.",News/World news,"Russia unleashed data-wiper virus on Ukraine, say cyber experts",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/russia-unleashed-data-wiper-virus-on-ukraine-say-cyber-experts
2/25/2022,"Greg Norman, who is fronting a Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway golf league, has warned the head of the PGA Tour “it certainly is not the end” despite a string of high-profile players shunning the scheme. In an open letter, Norman took specific issue with Jay Monahan’s insistence that players will be banned from competing on the PGA Tour if they sign a deal with the Saudis. Norman has now claimed the PGA Tour is “threatening” its members.  Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, Bryson DeChambeau, Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Collin Morikawa, Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson are among those who have pledged allegiance to the PGA despite Norman’s advances. Phil Mickelson finds himself in the eye of a public relations storm after admitting he used the Saudi Super Golf League plan to earn leverage with the PGA Tour. At a meeting of players in Florida on Tuesday, Monahan, the commissioner, reasserted that golfers cannot combine the SGL with the PGA Tour. Norman has now fired back. In the correspondence, the former world No1 states: “Surely you jest. And surely, your lawyers at the PGA Tour must be holding their breath. “As has been widely reported, you have threatened the players on the PGA Tour, all of whom are independent contractors, with lifetime bans if they decide to play golf in a league sponsored by anyone other than the Tour. For decades, I have fought for the rights of players to enjoy a career in which they are rewarded fully and properly for their efforts. They are one-in-a-million athletes. Yet for decades, the Tour has put its own financial ambitions ahead of the players, and every player on the tour knows it. The Tour is the players’ tour not your administration’s Tour. Norman added: “When you try to bluff and intimidate players by bullying and threatening them, you are guilty of going too far, being unfair, and you likely are in violation of the law. Simply put, you can’t ban players from playing golf. Players have the right and the freedom to play where we like. “What is wrong with allowing players to make their own decisions about where to play and how often to play? What is so wrong with player choice? Why do you feel so threatened that you would resort to such a desperate, unwise, and unenforceable threat?” The PGA Tour is likely to be undeterred by Norman’s remarks, not least because of the backing as offered by Woods and co. Previously, Monahan told players that action would be taken against anyone trying to cause commercial or reputational harm to his organisation. Norman, in turn, emphasises the value of competition. “Commissioner – this is just the beginning,” said his letter in closing. “It certainly is not the end.” The PGA Tour is yet to respond.",Sport/Sport,Greg Norman insists ‘it is not the end’ for Saudi-backed breakaway golf league,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/24/greg-norman-insists-it-is-not-the-end-for-saudi-backed-breakaway-golf-league
2/25/2022,"The EU faced furious remonstrations from Kyiv as Europe’s leaders looked set to hold back from imposing the potentially most damaging sanction on Russia, even as the Kremlin lay siege to Ukraine via land, air and sea. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, voiced his anger as EU heads of state and government appeared likely to decide against blocking Russia from an international payments system through which it receives foreign currency.  With casualties mounting, Kuleba warned that European and US politicians would have “blood on their hands” if they failed to impose the heaviest toll on Moscow by cutting Russia from the so-called Swift payments system. “I will not be diplomatic on this,” he tweeted. “Everyone who now doubts whether Russia should be banned from Swift has to understand that the blood of innocent Ukrainian men, women and children will be on their hands too. BAN RUSSIA FROM SWIFT.” The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) is used by over 11,000 financial institutions to send secure payment orders and is key to the movement of funds to Russia’s oil and gas sector. Removing Russia from the system, it is argued, would make it close to impossible for financial institutions to send money in or out of the country, with consequences for both the country’s oil and gas sector and its European customers. A number of member states believe there is nothing to be gained from waiting, a position shared by the UK government. During a call with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, urged allies to react with the harshest measures, warning that “western inaction or underreaction would have unthinkable consequences”. Diplomatic sources suggested that Germany, Cyprus and Italy were among the member states who were the most concerned about taking the measure at this stage, arguing that some leverage needs to be maintained. “Someone started a war and we want this war to stop here and now,” one EU diplomat explained of the caution over Swift. “You always need to have some doors open to be able to have a dialogue to stop a war.” The diplomat added: “It’s very clear that this is going to be massive if you’re going to target the financial sector much more than the package which is already out there. That’s going to be much more effective with high cost and consequences than doing one single issue on Swift, which might be needed for things which are very relevant for some EU member states.” The fissure in the united front with Ukraine came as EU leaders gathered in Brussels for what is set to be one of the most testing summits for a generation, with the bloc’s capacity to strike convincingly at Russian interests in question. Following a meeting with the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU would degrade Russian industry, push its economy into recession and block exports of irreplaceable components. “These sanctions will suppress Russia’s economic growth, increase the borrowing costs, raise inflation, intensify capital outflows and gradually erode its industrial base,” she said. “We want to cut off Russia’s industry from the technologies desperately needed today to build a future.” Von der Leyen said the Kremlin would be brought to account through “massive and targeted sanctions” over its “barbaric” action. “Our measures will weaken Russia’s technological position in key areas, actually from which the elite makes most of their money. And this ranges from hi-tech components to cutting-edge software,” she said. “This will also seriously degrade the Russian economy in all areas in the future. Let me be very clear: It is President Putin who will have to explain this to his citizens. I know that the Russian people do not want this war.” Belarus will also be subject to a sanctions package that has yet to be prepared for its role aiding Russia’s invasion from its territory, according to a leaked draft of an EU summit communique. But at a meeting of EU ambassadors, a consensus on the need for a major package of sanctions across the financial and energy sectors was marred by a lack of support for what many regard as the most damaging of actions, both for Moscow and European countries with the closest trading ties to Russia. Those opposed - dubbed the “incrementals” – were said to be pushing to hold back from imposing the most onerous measures. Officials suggested that Swift may be held back as part of a “third tranche” of sanctions. It is argued by some diplomats in Brussels that Russia could find ways around being blocked from Swift and that the other measures would be just as significant in squeezing the Kremlin. The more hawkish EU capitals have also privately voiced concerns that a number of key oligarchs will be left out of the coming package of EU measures. The Dutch government was vocal behind the scenes in seeking to include a larger number of the wealthy and powerful around Putin, according to sources. There is also irritation in Brussels that the UK government is not being strong enough on hitting oligarchs such as Roman Abramovich, whose private jet was reportedly tracked leaving Monaco for Russia earlier on Thursday.",News/World news,Kyiv furious as EU wavers on banning Russia from Swift payment system,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/kyiv-furious-as-eu-wavers-on-banning-russia-from-swift-payment-system
2/25/2022,"Nearly every UK bank has struggled over the past decade managing the fallout of multi-billion pound taxpayer bailouts, business scams or devastating IT meltdowns. But few have faced quite as many scandals, near-failures and turnaround efforts as the Co-operative Bank. During that period the mid-size lender has teetered on collapse, its former chief executive was charged for drug possession, it has been bailed out by a group of hedge funds, and it has changed its boss six times in nine years.  But the bank, which has its roots in the ethical cooperative movements and was formed in 1872, has survived the fallout of the so-called Crystal Methodist scandal and is now enjoying relative stability under its hedge fund owners, who have seen it to its first profit in a decade. Its newest chief executive, Nick Slape, is insistent that the bank’s 150th anniversary this year will be a turning point. He says it is an opportunity to look beyond recent scandals and spark new excitement over the UK’s “original ethical bank”, which reported on Thursday a £31m profit for 2021 – its first since 2011. The Co-op Bank also more than tripled its bonus pot for bankers to £13.3m after what it described as a “milestone year”. Slape’s team have been rifling through archives to prepare for November’s anniversary. The bank traces its origins to the 1872 establishment of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, the body that would become the Co-operative Group. It was meant to provide financial services to the wider cooperative movement in Britain, in which member-owned businesses worked for the common good. While the bank has since separated from the group, having been taken over by its hedge fund investors as part of a £700m rescue deal in 2017, and no longer counts itself as a member-owned organisation, it has tried to maintain its ethical roots. Although hedge funds and private equity investors are often slated for their focus on maximising profits and short-term gains, Slape is quick to emphasise that the bank’s ethical policies are enshrined in its articles of association, which its shareholders have in effect signed up to. “We take it seriously: with real policies that are approved by the board, and a values and ethics committee that monitors it all, and we report it to the Co-operatives UK,” Slape said, referring to the national industry body that monitors and coordinates on behalf of cooperatives across the country. In 2019, the bank agreed to formally recognise a customer “union” aimed at protecting its ethical policies, which was formed out of the Save Our Bank campaign after the Co-operative Bank’s near collapse in 2013, the year the lender’s financial troubles first came to light. That year, a £1.5bn hole was discovered in its accounts after the disastrous 2009 takeover of the Britannia building society. “That led to its own kind of crisis over the next few years,” Slape said, resulting in the first rescue deal that started the bank’s disentanglement from the larger Co-operative Group. Its troubles were compounded when the bank’s former chair, the ex-Labour councillor and Methodist church minister Paul Flowers, nicknamed the Crystal Methodist, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine in 2014. Slape said Flowers’ charges drove away more customers than the bank’s balance sheet woes ever did. “The only time that they ever really moved away was with the news of the previous chairman that was in the tabloids,” he said. “That clearly played very much on the ethics and the values of the bank. So that’s when my predecessors saw [customer] attrition. Other than that, we’ve got really loyal customers that have stuck with us.” That loyalty was maintained even after the hedge funds took full control nearly five years ago. The group, which includes Silver Point Capital, GoldenTree, Anchorage Capital and Cyrus Capital and the fund manager Invesco, now collectively owns 85% of the bank, with the remainder held by a range of undisclosed institutional investors. Every Co-operative Bank chief executive since has been dogged by questions about when its hedge fund owners will plot an exit. They came close in November 2020, when the New York-based private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management offered about £270m to buy the lender. However, those talks broke down a month later. No further offers have been made and Slape, a former Lloyds, Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch banker, is setting his sights on future growth. Having already built up more capital – the​ financial cushion banks must hold to protect them from risky loans and products on their balance sheets – the Co-operative Bank has an opportunity finally to return some cash to its shareholders, or, as Slape puts it, “invest in something”. That could mean buying a loan portfolio or buying another bank to merge with the lender, which on its own has 3.2 million personal customers, 95,000 business clients and 50 branches across the UK. Slape’s team in October tabled a tentative offer, which has since been rejected, for the takeover of the banking rival TSB. But with the Co-operative Bank’s credit rating on the rise – Moody’s upgraded the bank’s unsecured debt rating by two notches last month – Slape says it has further opportunities on the horizon. “We’ve got some big enablers that have been put in place that are allowing us to sort of think about things that we couldn’t think about before, when we weren’t profitable. So all of these things are positive,” he said. Moody’s credited the bank’s upgrade on its “continued progress towards a more sustainable business model” and its improving profitability, but added that the latter could remain “very weak” during the next 12-18 months and that a further downgrade could be possible if profitability proved unsustainable beyond 2021. However, those risks seem unlikely to phase Slape, who is toying with the idea of a stock market flotation that would allow the Co-operative Bank’s longstanding hedge fund investors to exit by 2023. “We’ve got a strong board, we do all our reporting completely consistent of what you do as a public company. So it’s not a big step-change for us,” Slape said. “This is clearly an option.”",News/Business,‘Milestone year’: hedge funds mull future of revived Co-op Bank,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/24/milestone-year-hedge-funds-mull-future-of-revived-co-op-bank

2/25/2022,"The repayment term for student loans will be extended from 30 years after graduation to 40 years – meaning that many students will still be making repayments into their 60s – and income threshold at which repayments begin will be lowered from more than £27,000 to £25,000. The tuition fee for full-time undergraduates will be frozen at £9,250 a year until the end of the current parliament.  Only students enrolling in 2023-24 will have to sign up for the terms including the 40-year repayment period. They will also be charged a lower interest rate on their outstanding loans. Graduates since 2012 have paid interest based on the retail price index, rising by up to 3% depending on income. But the extra 3% will be scrapped, and RPI used solely. Yes. The freeze on tuition fees will be extended to those students from England studying full-time, so that their institutions will see real terms cuts in incomes. The undergraduate tuition fee was set at £9,000 in 2012 and was supposed to rise with inflation. However, the government has frozen it at £9,250 since 2016. Current students and graduates with student loans since 2012 will also see their repayment thresholds frozen at £27,000 – that too was meant to rise with inflation but instead graduates will have to repay more than they otherwise would. Potentially yes: the government has begun a consultation over minimum eligibility requirements to receive loans immediately after leaving school. The Department for Education’s consultation suggests achieving two grade Es at A-level or equivalents as one possibility. Another is achieving grade 4 passes in GCSE maths and English. But strong opposition and a wide range of exemptions may effectively make the policy too difficult to implement. The eligibility rules are unlikely to apply to mature or part-time students, although the more prolonged and faster repayments may put off some students. The DfE says the changes to student finance will have a “neutral impact” and thinks the changes are unlikely to “significantly” change the minds of those aiming to study at university. The universities minister, Michelle Donelan, said the effects on students with special needs would need to be carefully considered. The biggest winner is the Treasury, which is estimated to gain an additional £600m in loan repayments, substantially reducing the amount of unpaid loans that would expire after 30 years. Other winners are the very well-paid who will see their maximum loan repayments fall by more than 25%. The losers are young women, disadvantaged students, and those students coming from the north of England, Yorkshire and the Humber and the Midlands who will see their repayments rise in some cases by 150%.",News/Education,Post-18 education review: the changes and the effects they may have,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/24/post-18-education-funding-changes-effects-tuition-fees-student-loans-england
2/25/2022,"A critically acclaimed and award-winning television drama series about politics, corruption and class in the north-east of England has been given a new modern-day ending in a BBC Radio 4 adaptation. Our Friends in the North, which turbocharged the early careers of its stars Gina McKee, Daniel Craig, Christopher Eccleston and Mark Strong, has been adapted for audio by its original writer, Peter Flannery.  The drama is set in the mid-1960s to the mid-90s, but a new 10th episode takes the main characters’ stories up to the year 2020. The final episode – by a new writer, Adam Usden – picks up on and develops the themes of the original drama. Our Friends in the North, broadcast on BBC2 in 1996, was hailed as a landmark show that combined gritty politics with personal relationships. “I’ve always said it’s just a posh soap opera – but it’s a posh soap opera with something to say,” Flannery, who was born in Jarrow, south Tyneside, once said. The storyline follows four friends over three decades against a backdrop of political, corporate and police corruption, shoddy housing scandals, the 1970s porn empires, the 1980s miners’ strike and the rise of New Labour in the 1990s. In 2010, the Guardian named it the third best television drama of all time. “Every school history department should own the DVD box set, for among titillating scenes of go-go dancers, gangland squabbles and unplanned pregnancies, a strong lesson about Britain’s past mistakes resonates clearly … The closing scenes in 90s Tyneside accompanied by an Oasis soundtrack are unforgettably moving,” wrote Grace Dent. Our Friends in the North was originally written as a three-hour stage play by Flannery, when he was writer-in-residence at the Royal Shakespeare Company. The TV adaptation – which cost £8m to make, half of BBC2’s drama serials budget for a year – was beset with legal problems because of similarities to real-life politicians and business people. Bringing the storyline up to date was daunting, said Usden. “It was a complete story. [Flannery] had landed the plane, and now I was being asked to take off again, and not crash it. “And the show has so many big ideas, it covers so many huge topics, it felt a bit reductive to pick up on just one or two. I tried to navigate that by focusing on what underpinned those themes – the sense of ordinary people being buffeted by forces above and beyond them. And legacy is such a core element of the show, which is helpful when you’re picking up a story 25 years on.” Usden said he had not discussed his final episode with Flannery. “I really love the show, and I’d like to think that this is a story that picks up on many threads from the original. I hope that he’s excited to see the continuation of the narrative.” Alison Hindell, Radio 4 commissioning editor for drama and fiction, said the themes of Our Friends in the North “illuminated the continuing north-south divide today”. She hoped the adaptation would find a new audience as well as being welcomed by fans of the original show. The parts of Nicky, Mary, Tosker and Geordie are taken by four young actors in the R4 adaptation – James Baxter, Norah Lopez Holden, Philip Correia and Luke MacGregor.

2/25/2022,"Warren East, the chief executive with a penchant for playing a church organ, is leaving Rolls-Royce, eight years after he was parachuted in as chief executive to navigate Britain’s aerospace champion through what turned out to be the most turbulent period in its 116-year history. On his second day at Rolls-Royce the Welshman was forced to issue a profit warning – the fourth of what would become five in a 20-month period – and presided over a record £4.6bn loss in his second year.  “I didn’t know quite how bad it was,” he recalled as he began to uncover just how parlous the Rolls-Royce business was when he started in 2015. “I don’t think anybody did. It was more a case of survival.” East, now 60, was called off the board of directors at Rolls to take the helm of the jet engine maker after the surprise announcement by his predecessor, John Rishton, that he was to retire after only four years in the post. Shares rose when East was named as Rishton’s successor, as investors welcomed the appointment of the engineer, and they fell 13% on Thursday when it was announced he would step down at the end of this year. Two years before he was appointed chief executive of Rolls, East had retired from Cambridge-based microchip design company Arm, where over a decade he had helped make it a critical global partner for companies from Apple to Samsung, but the task at Rolls-Royce would prove to be the defining challenge of his career. The company had previously enjoyed two decades of unprecedented success under the leadership of Sir Ralph Robins and Sir John Rose, cementing the company’s place as the world’s second-largest maker of aircraft engines after General Electric. However, it was left to East, the part-time church organist, who confesses he enjoys a “great wrestle” with a difficult piece of music, to handle the devastating fall out of investigations into claims that the multinational had paid bribes to secure contracts in countries around the world. Five years ago the company paid £671m to avoid prosecution by authorities in the UK, US and Brazil – and East has in the past recounted how stunned he was to learn that the practices continued until as recently as 2013. “The genuine surprise was how recent some of the instances were,” he said in an interview a year after the fines, which were finally paid in full last year, were announced. “Most people thought it was prehistoric.” East, who has three children, attended Monmouth School for Boys in Wales and has a degree in engineering science from Wadham College, Oxford. He has said that his management style is not best suited for the thick-skinned job of big cuts and restructuring, certainly his time at Arm was a growth story, and yet at Rolls-Royce he will be remembered for managing one crisis after another. “[It] isn’t why I joined Rolls-Royce,” he has said. “I am probably not the best turnaround person there is.” The discovery of a series of failings with its Trent 1000 engines, which power the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, cost the company billions. In 2018, he said almost 5,000 job losses would be necessary “if we want to be around for the next 100 years”. East will bow out having for the most part weathered the worst of the crippling coronavirus pandemic, albeit after an emergency £7bn refinancing and asset fire sale, and at the cost of almost 9,000 jobs and billions in losses as the aviation industry came to a virtual standstill during lockdowns. When East took over, Rolls-Royce was valued at £15.7bn. As he enters his final months it is worth just over £8bn, and he leaves the company facing the steep challenge of moving away from fossil fuel-powered products and achieving a net zero carbon business. “This is the biggest technological shift for the group since the arrival of the jet engine,” he said, announcing his departure on Thursday. “[It] is the right moment to look to the future.”",News/Business,Warren East profile: The Rolls-Royce troubleshooter,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/24/warren-east-profile-the-rolls-royce-troubleshooter
2/25/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is an unprovoked outrage and a heinous violation of international law. It is proof of his utter disregard for the health and wealth of the people of Russia and Ukraine. He is a tyrant prepared to take lives, destroy infrastructure and rob his own citizens in the name of a demented imperialist dream. The economic sanctions that the UK, its allies and partners enforce must be as severe as possible. The aim should be to cut Russia out of the western economic system, targeting the finance, energy, technology and defence sectors as well as individuals linked to Putin and the Russian government. The effects should be deep and long-lasting. This confrontation will last for years into the future. And here at home, after years of stubborn inaction, the government must now finally expunge corrupt Russian money from the UK. We must close the cracks and loopholes through which the tentacles of corrupt finance reach into our economy and democracy.  While sanctions are essential, we know that Putin’s concerns go far beyond the depth of his pockets, as shown by his willingness to act despite western threats of economic pain. Russia has been preparing for sanctions for at least two years. So, to defeat Russian aggression, we need to do more than attack Putin’s bank balance. While sanctions must be as comprehensive as possible, we need a broader response to face down his aggression. To defeat Putin, we need to unite against the ideology of Putinism. This is an ideology of authoritarianism, imperialism and ethno-nationalism. It is not unique to Russia. This ideology is emulated by despots and dictators around the world: leaders in China, the Middle East and beyond will be watching the strength of the west’s response to this invasion as they plot their next moves. Russia’s attack will have long-term implications for the security of Europe. If Putin is successful in the short term, the new frontline to Russian aggression will widen to include Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary, as well as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. We must work with our Nato and European allies and partners to bolster our continent’s defence and security and show strength, unity and resolve. But the opposition to Putinism needs to be broader than the G7, the EU or Nato. We need to rally the world against this threat and widen the international coalition that will oppose this grievous act of war, and counter Putin’s ideology of nationalistic expansion. We need to ensure that other global players such as India oppose the terrible precedent set by Putin’s invasion of a sovereign UN member state and his attempt to change national borders through military force. We must be clear that our opposition is to Putin and his gangster regime, not ordinary Russian people. Many of them will be feeling deeply uneasy as Russian troops wade across their nearest neighbour’s border, the home of many of their family and friends. Internal opposition to Putin’s deranged expansionism is the best hope of ending it. It’s imperative that we speak directly to them, making the argument for democracy, freedom and the right to self-determination, and never allowing our opposition to Putin to obscure our desire for friendship and peace with Russian people. It’s essential that we convince aspiring despots around the world that the Russian regime’s slide into imperialism is a historic mistake. Any victory will be pyrrhic in the long term, just as the invasion of Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Afghanistan in 1979 all turned out to be failures in the end. The result of invasion is always brutal destruction, with civilians caught in the middle paying a terrible price. It is a moral imperative that we continue to help Ukraine to defend itself by providing defensive equipment alongside political, diplomatic and financial support. The Russian regime’s invasion of Ukraine signals the end of the post-cold war era. Nobody knows what comes next. The effects of this moment will depend as much on our response to this aggression as it will on the aggression itself. The response of the UK, its allies and its partners has to be strong not weak, united not divided, and strategic rather than short term. Our values of democracy and freedom must defeat Putinism in the end.

The moment came overnight, when Russian troops began attacking Ukraine by land, air and sea. For the US president – increasingly embattled at home by a resurgent Republican party – it was evidence that the White House had largely assessed the Ukraine crisis correctly, even though they would their preference would have been to be wrong about their predictions of a disastrous war in Europe.  Now the conflict has dumped a huge foreign policy crisis into an already difficult second year in office, with a likely backlash looming in November’s midterm elections. With few exceptions, though, he largely has the Democratic party behind him and the Republicans are split, with many backing Biden even as others take various potshots at his presidency. But, for the moment, there is the immediate invasion to deal with. On Thursday morning, Biden met in the Situation Room with his National Security Council to discuss the latest developments in Ukraine. He then met virtually with the leaders of the G7 to discuss “their joint response to President Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine,” a White House official said. Biden was preparing to deliver remarks from the East Room of the White House at midday. “President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,” Biden said in a statement. “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.” Biden has vowed unprecedented sanctions against Russia, while pledging that the US would not send troops to Ukraine, warning that to do so would risk a wider war in Europe. But the US has provided arms supplies to Ukraine and sent additional troops to the Baltic states as part of his promise to “defend every inch of Nato territory”. “Sacred” was how the US president described the US commitment to Nato’s article 5, in which an attack on any member nation triggers an allied military response. Domestically, the Biden administration has so far been praised for its decision to quickly declassify intelligence, revealing Putin’s secret plans in real time. Though it was not enough to deter Putin, it helped Washington forge a united front against Moscow in the shadow of the administration’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan last year that left the US weaker in the eyes of many allies and foes around the world. But after multiple high-profile intelligence failures, the US’s assessment proved largely correct. And when Biden said he believed that Putin had already made the decision to attack, it appears he was right. The accuracy of the intelligence shared by the US, and the unity of the transatlantic alliance, may help give the US renewed credibility on the world stage, where Biden has repeatedly warned that democracies are under threat. In Congress, members have broadly condemned Russia’s attack on Ukraine and urged the Biden administration to implement the long-promised paralyzing sanctions. Many Republicans have criticized the administration’s response so far as too little too late, even though senators failed to agree to a bipartisan sanctions package against Russia before leaving Washington for a week-long recess. They settled instead for issuing a strongly worded statement. Underscoring the deep polarization Biden faces at home, a number of Republicans tried to blame him for enabling Putin, including many of the same officials who remained silent as Trump praised and flattered the Russian president. By contrast, however, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy – one of the most powerful Republicans in Congress – made no mention of the US president in a statement condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “reckless and evil”. “Putin’s actions must be met with serious consequence. This act of war is intended to rewrite history and more concerning, upend the balance of power in Europe. Putin must be held accountable for his actions,” he said. “Putin’s impunity predictably follows our tepid response to his previous horrors in Georgia and Crimea, our naive efforts at a one-sided ‘reset’, and the shortsightedness of ‘America First,’” said Utah senator Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee. “‘The 80s called and we didn’t answer.” On Twitter, Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator who met with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a recent trip to eastern Europe, warned that the “entire postwar international order sits on a knife edge”. “If Putin does not pay a devastating price for this transgression, then our own security will soon be at risk,” he wrote. “We must be unceasingly in our assistance to the Ukrainian people. We must levy crippling sanctions on Russia. And we must cut off Putin and his cronies from the global economy. A strong, swift response is vital.” In a bizarre interview on Fox News, Donald Trump mistakenly stated that it was the US, not Russia, invading Ukraine. He was quickly corrected, but spent much of the appearance airing old grievances and attacking his successor. Repeating the baseless claim that the election was stolen, Trump concluded: “It all happened because of a rigged election.” US stock markets dropped sharply on Thursday as investors waited to hear more about what sanctions Biden would impose on Russia. After the assault began, the price of oil passed $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014, a rise that will drive up fuel prices even as the US wrestles with the worst inflation in decades. US trade with Russia is relatively small but the conflict’s impact on oil prices was driving up gas prices even before the invasion. In a press conference last week, Biden warned Americans that war in Europe would have consequences for US consumers, already suffering from soaring inflation. “I will not pretend this will be painless,” he said. Biden said he would do everything to alleviate the economic pinch, including to tap the US national oil reserves, which he has already done in his effort to combat the fastest increase in US inflation in three decades. Higher prices pose an immediate political and economic challenge for the president, whose approval ratings have slumped amid rising gas and food prices. Republicans have blamed Democrats for inflation, which is top of mind for voters ahead of this year’s midterm elections in November.",News/US news,Biden’s Russia warnings come to pass – what now for the US president?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/24/biden-ukraine-russia-republicans-democrats-us-politics
