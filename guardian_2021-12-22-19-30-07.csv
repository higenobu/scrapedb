12/22/2021,"It’s been a bumper year for the slavering ghouls that run some of the games industry’s biggest publishers, who have found fresh ways to extract value from players through NFTs and cryptocurrency while producing little of value. Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator, with its economy of dripping kidneys and fresh-plucked nerve clusters, feels downright wholesome by comparison, a truly rustic post-capitalist digital hellscape. It’s a premise as old as time: buy low, sell eyes. And spleens. More of a frantic clicker-game than a strategy sim, Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator is only slightly more complex than a screensaver, though still chemically compulsive. Days are split between navigating a fleshy stock market, and trying to outbid cyborgs and dogs with names like Chad Shakespeare on the freshest human cuts. Think eBay as overseen by Harlan Ellison’s Allied Mastercomputer. You accept orders, wait for the organs to show up, grab them before a rival trader does and try to make a profit. As you progress, your customers get fussier. Organs are graded like trading cards, or Destiny loot drops. Where does a mythic lung come from, anyway? No time to think about it. The market wants what it wants.  Director Xalavier Nelson Jr – previously a writer on online satire game Hypnospace Outlaw – has pedigree in fabricating artefacts from bygone internet eras. This, similarly, feels like a lost early-internet browser game, like the MSDOS classic Drug Lord 2. It feels like a subversive secret, simple enough to load up in a tab but moreish enough to vacuum up hours of free time. While limitless profit is the central premise, there are unlockable endings. Satiating requests from particular aliens sends you down different story threads and a sparse narrative unfolds through these snippets. It’s just enough to build intrigue without interrupting all the spleen-slinging, although not substantial enough to be considered a real payoff. Instead, victories arrive in the moment: the subtle bleeps that let you know you’ve scored a profit, however minimal, on your latest acquisition, or the guilty rapture of realising your latest haul of livers are now worth their oozing weight in gold. SWOTS never breaks pace to impose introspection, but like Universal Paperclips or Cookie Clicker, the loop itself conveys all it needs to. The reasons why this blueprint is irresistible to human brains might be best left unexamined. The soundtrack is one of the best of the year, and it’s incredibly stylish. But the sheer gory, numerical compulsion at its core gets more terrifying the more you consider how much sway this manic impulse toward numb, exploitative accumulation holds in our own world. Dystopias like this used to feel creepily prescient. Now, they just feel terrifyingly honest. Merry Christmas, by the way.

12/22/2021,"“Let us be reminded that before there is a final solution, there must be a first solution, a second one, even a third. The move toward a final solution is not a jump. It takes one step, then another, then another.” So began Toni Morrison’s 1995 address to Howard University, entitled Racism and Fascism, which delineated 10 step-by-step procedures to carry a society from first to last.  Morrison’s interest was not in fascist demagogues or fascist regimes. It was rather in “forces interested in fascist solutions to national problems”. The procedures she described were methods to normalize such solutions, to “construct an internal enemy”, isolate, demonize and criminalize it and sympathizers to its ideology and their allies, and, using the media, provide the illusion of power and influence to one’s supporters. Morrison saw, in the history of US racism, fascist practices – ones that could enable a fascist social and political movement in the United States. Writing in the era of the “super-predator” myth (a Newsweek headline the next year read, “Superpredators: Should we cage the new breed of vicious kids?”), Morrison unflinchingly read fascism into the practices of US racism. Twenty-five years later, those “forces interested in fascist solutions to national problems” are closer than ever to winning a multi-decade national fight. The contemporary American fascist movement is led by oligarchical interests for whom the public good is an impediment, such as those in the hydrocarbon business, as well as a social, political, and religious movement with roots in the Confederacy. As in all fascist movements, these forces have found a popular leader unconstrained by the rules of democracy, this time in the figure of Donald Trump. My father, raised in Berlin under the Nazis, saw in European fascism a course that any country could take. He knew that US democracy was not exceptional in its capacity to resist the forces that shattered his family and devastated his youth. My mother, a court stenographer in US criminal courts for 44 years, saw in the anti-Black racism of the American legal system parallels to the vicious antisemitism she experienced in her youth in Poland, attitudes which enabled eastern European complicity with fascism. And my grandmother, Ilse Stanley, wrote a memoir, published in 1957, of her experiences in 1930s Berlin, later appearing on the US television show This is Your Life to discuss it. It is a memoir of the normalization years of German fascism, well before world war and genocide. In it, she recounts experiences with Nazi officers who assured her that in nazism’s vilification of Jews, they certainly did not mean her. Philosophers have always been at the forefront in the analysis of fascist ideology and movements. In keeping with a tradition that includes the philosophers Hannah Arendt and Theodore Adorno, I have been writing for a decade on the way politicians and movement leaders employ propaganda, centrally including fascist propaganda, to win elections and gain power. Often, those who employ fascist tactics do so cynically – they do not really believe the enemies they target are so malign, or so powerful, as their rhetoric suggests. Nevertheless, there comes a tipping point, where rhetoric becomes policy. Donald Trump and the party that is now in thrall to him have long been exploiting fascist propaganda. They are now inscribing it into fascist policy. Fascist propaganda takes place in the US in already fertile ground – decades of racial strife has led to the United States having by far the highest incarceration rate in the world. A police militarized to address the wounds of racial inequities by violence, and a recent history of unsuccessful imperial wars have made us susceptible to a narrative of national humiliation by enemies both internal and external. As WEB Du Bois showed in his 1935 masterwork Black Reconstruction, there is a long history of business elites backing racism and fascism out of self-interest, to divide the working class and thereby destroy the labor movement. The novel development is that a ruthless would-be autocrat has marshalled these fascist forces and shaped them into a cult, with him as its leader. We are now well into the repercussions of this latter process – where fascist lies, for example, the “big lie” that the 2020 election was stolen, have begun to restructure institutions, notably electoral infrastructure and law. As this process unfolds, slowly and deliberately, the media’s normalization of these processes evokes Morrison’s tenth and final step: “Maintain, at all costs, silence.” To understand contemporary US fascism, it is useful to consider parallels to 20th century history, both where they succeed and where they fail. Hitler was a genocidal antisemite. Though fascism involves disregard for human life, not all fascists are genocidal. Even Nazi Germany turned to genocide only relatively late in the regime’s rule. And not all fascists are antisemitic. There were Italian Jewish fascists. Referring to the successful assimilation of Jews into all phases of Weimar era German life, my father warned me, “if they had chosen someone else, some of us would have been among the very best Nazis.” We American Jews feel firmly at home. Now, where the fascist movement’s internal enemies are leftists and movements for Black racial equality, there certainly could be fascist American Jews. Germany’s National Socialist party did not take over a mainstream party. It started as a small, radical, far-right anti-democratic party, which faced different pressures as it strove to achieve greater electoral success. Despite its radical start, the Nazi party dramatically increased its popularity over many years in part by strategically masking its explicit antisemitic agenda to attract moderate voters, who could convince themselves that the racism at the core of Nazi ideology was something the party had outgrown. It represented itself as the antidote to communism, using a history of political violence in the Weimar Republic, including street clashes between communists and the far right, to warn of a threat of violent communist revolution. It attracted support from business elites by promising to smash labor unions. The Nazis portrayed socialists, Marxists, liberals, labor unions, the cultural world and the media as representatives of, or sympathizers with, this revolution. Once in power, they bore down on this message. In his 1935 speech, Communism with its Mask Off, Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels described Bolshevism carrying “on a campaign, directed by the Jews, with the international underworld, against culture as such”. By contrast, “National Socialism sees in all these things – in [private] property, in personal values and in nation and race and the principles of idealism – these forces which carry on every human civilization and fundamentally determine its worth.” The Nazis recognized that the language of family, faith, morality and homeland could be used to justify especially brutal violence against an enemy represented as being opposed to all these things. The central message of Nazi politics was to demonize a set of constructed enemies, an unholy alliance of communists and Jews, and ultimately to justify their criminalization. Contrary to popular belief, the Nazi government of the 1930s was not genocidal, nor were its notorious concentration camps packed with Jewish prisoners, at least until the November pogrom of 1938. The main targets of the regime’s concentration camps were, initially, communists and socialists. The Nazi regime urged vigilante violence against its other targets, such as Jews, separating themselves from this violence by obscuring the role of agents of the state. During this time, it was possible for many non-Jewish Germans to deceive themselves about the brutal nature of the regime, to tell themselves that its harsh means were necessary to protect the German nation from the insidious threat of communism. Violent militias occupied an ambiguous role between state and non-state actors. The SS began as violent Nazi supporters, before becoming an independent arm of the government. The message of violent law and order created a culture that influenced all the Nazi state’s institutions. As Yale historian Timothy Snyder writes in On Tyranny, “for violence to transform not just the atmosphere but also the system, the emotions of rallies and the ideology of exclusion have to be incorporated into the training of armed guards.” In the US, the training of police as “warriors”, together with the unofficial replacement of the American flag by the thin blue line flag, auger poorly about the democratic commitments of this institution. For a far-right party to become viable in a democracy, it must present a face it can defend as moderate, and cultivate an ambiguous relationship to the extreme views and statements of its most explicit members. It must maintain a pretense of the rule of law, characteristically by projecting its own violations of it on to its opponents. In the case of the takeover of the mainstream rightwing party by a far-right anti-democratic movement, the pretense must be stronger. The movement must contend with members of that party who are faithful to procedural elements of democracy, such as the principle of one voter one vote, or that the loser of a fair election give up power – in the United States today, figures such as Adam Kinzinger and Elizabeth Cheney. A fascist social and political party faces pressure both to mask its connection to and to cultivate violent racist supporters, as well as its inherently anti-democratic agenda. In the face of the attack on the US capital on 6 January, even the most resolute skeptic must admit that Republican politicians have been at least attempting to cultivate a mass of violent vigilantes to support their causes. Kyle Rittenhouse is becoming a hero to Republicans after showing up in Kenosha, WI as an armed vigilante citizen, and killing two men. Perhaps there are not enough potential Kyle Rittenhouses in the US to justify fear of massive armed vigilante militias enforcing a 2024 election result demanded by Donald Trump. But denying that Trump’s party is trying to create such a movement is, at this point, deliberate deception. Street violence proved invaluable to the National Socialists in their path to power. The Nazis instigated and exacerbated violence in the streets, then demonized their opponents as enemies of the German people who must be dealt with harshly. Trump’s rise followed Black protest, at times violent, of police brutality in Ferguson and Baltimore. More recently, the murder of George Floyd and a historic protest movement in the US in the late spring has given fuel to fascist misrepresentation. All of these recent developments take place as only the latest in a long US history of Black rebellion against white supremacist ideology and structures, and a parallel history of white backlash. White vigilante groups regularly formed in reaction to Black rebellions, to “defend their families and property against Black rebellion”, the historian Elizabeth Hinton writes in her recent history of these rebellions. Hinton shows that police often acted in concert with these groups. For decades, the instigator of these rebellions has typically been an incident or incidents of police violence against members of the community, following a long period of often violent over-policing that exacerbated these communities’ grievances. Street movements in the US have often been accompanied by vigorous campus protests, from the protests against the Vietnam war of the 1960s, to recent campus protests for racial justice that attracted media rebuke (paradoxically, for “chilling free speech”). Politicians in both parties have feasted on these moments, using them to troll for votes. During these episodes of protest and rebellion, US politicians from Barry Goldwater onwards, placing campus protests together with Black rebellion against over-policing, have encouraged harsh law and order policing and crackdowns on leftists. John Ehrlichman, one of Nixon’s top advisers, said that Nixon’s campaign and administration “had two enemies: the anti-war left and Black people”, and invented the drug war to target both: You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did. Politicians have shown less interest in addressing the underlying conditions that lead to violence in poor Black urban communities – the widespread availability of guns, the massive and persistent racial wealth gap and the effects of violent policing and mass incarceration. And why should they? As long as these underlying conditions persist, politicians of either party can run for office by milking fear and promising a harsh law and order response. Morrison’s 1995 address is a warning that these conditions are ripe for harnessing by a fascist movement, one targeting democracy itself. In its most recent iteration, in the form of the reaction against Black Lives Matter protesters and the demonization of antifa and student activists, a fascist social and political movement has been avidly stoking the flames for mass rightwing political violence, by justifying it against these supposed internal enemies. Rachel Kleinfield, in an October 2021 article, documents the rise of the legitimation of political violence in the US. According to the article, the “bedrock idea uniting right-wing communities who condone violence is that white Christian men in the United States are under cultural and demographic threat and require defending – and that it is the Republican Party and Donald Trump, in particular, who will safeguard their way of life.” This kind of justification of political violence is classically fascist – a dominant group threatened by the prospect of gender, racial and religious equality turning to a leader who promises a violent response. We are now in fascism’s legal phase. According to the International Center for Not for Profit Law, 45 states have considered 230 bills criminalizing protest, with the threat of violent leftist and Black rebellion being used to justify them. That this is happening at the same time that multiple electoral bills enabling a Republican state legislature majority to overturn their state’s election have been enacted suggests that the true aim of bills criminalizing protest is to have a response in place to expected protests against the stealing of a future election (as a reminder of fascism’s historical connection to big business, some of these laws criminalize protest near gas and oil lines). The Nazis used Judeo-Bolshevism as their constructed enemy. The fascist movement in the Republican party has turned to critical race theory instead. Fascism feeds off a narrative of supposed national humiliation by internal enemies. Defending a fictional glorious and virtuous national past, and presenting its enemies as deviously maligning the nation to its children, is a classic fascist strategy to stoke fury and resentment. Using the bogeyman of critical race theory, 29 states have introduced bills to restrict teaching about racism and sexism in schools, and 13 states have enacted such bans. The key to democracy is an informed electorate. An electorate that knows about persisting racial injustice in the United States along all its dimensions, from the racial wealth gap to the effects of over-policing and over-incarceration, will be unsurprised by mass political rebellion in the face of persistent refusal to face up to these problems. An electorate ignorant of these facts will react not with understanding, but with uncomprehending fear and horror at Black political unrest. Sometimes, you trace a fascist movement to its genesis in Nazi influence on its leaders, as with India’s RSS. In the United States, the causal relations run the other way around. As James Whitman shows in his 2017 book, Hitler’s American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law, the Jim Crow era in the United States influenced Nazi law. In 2021, legislators in 19 states passed laws making access to the ballot more difficult, some with specific (and clearly intentional) disparate impact on minority communities (as in Texas). By obscuring in our education system facts about this era, one can mask the reemergence of legislation that borrows from its strategies. Indeed, the very tactic of restricting politically vital information to schoolchildren is itself borrowed from the Jim Crow era. Chapter 9 of Carter G Woodson’s 1933 book, The Mis-Education of the Negro, is called Political Education Neglected. In it, Woodson describes how history was taught “to enslave the Negroes’ mind”, by whitewashing the brutality of slavery and the actual roots and causes of racial disparities. In Fugitive Pedagogy: Carter G Woodson and the Art of Black Teaching, Jarvis Givens documents the strategies Black educators used to convey real history in the constricted environments of Jim Crow schools, strategies that, tragically, will again become necessary for educators to take up again today. Fascist ideology strictly enforces gender roles and restricts the freedom of women. For fascists, it is part of their commitment to a supposed “natural order” where men are on top. It is also integral to the broader fascist strategy of winning over social conservatives who might otherwise be unhappy with the endemic corruption of fascist rule. Far-right authoritarian leaders across the world, such as Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, have targeted “gender ideology”, as nazism targeted feminism. Freedom to choose one’s role in society, when it goes against a supposed “natural order”, is a kind of freedom fascism has always opposed. According to National Socialist ideology, abortion, at any point in pregnancy, was considered to be murder. Just as it was acceptable to murder disabled people and other groups whose identities were considered dangerous to the health of the “Aryan race”, it was acceptable to perform abortions on members of these groups. In the first six years of Nazi rule, from 1933 to 1939, there was a harsh crackdown on the birth control movement. Led by the Gestapo, there was a punitive campaign against doctors who performed abortions on Aryan women. The recent attack on abortion rights, and the coming attack on birth control, led by a hard-right supreme court, is consistent with the hypothesis that we are, in the United States, facing a real possibility of a fascist future. If you want to topple a democracy, you take over the courts. Donald Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in 2016 by almost 3m votes, and yet has appointed one-third of supreme court, three youthful far-right judges who will be spending decades there. The Roberts court has for more than a decade consistently enabled an attack on democracy, by hollowing out the Voting Rights Act over time, unleashing unlimited corporate money into elections, and allowing clearly partisan gerrymanders of elections. There is every reason to believe that the court will allow even the semblance of democracy to crumble, as long as laws are passed by gerrymandered Republican statehouses that make anti-democratic practices, including stealing elections, legal. There has been a growing fascist social and political movement in the United States for decades. Like other fascist movements, it is riddled with internal contradictions, but no less of a threat to democracy. Donald Trump is an aspiring autocrat out solely for his own power and material gain. By giving this movement a classically authoritarian leader, Trump shaped and exacerbated it, and his time in politics has normalized it. Donald Trump has shown others what is possible. But the fascist movement he now leads preceded him, and will outlive him. As Toni Morrison warned, it feeds off ideologies with deep roots in American history. It would be a grave error to think it cannot ultimately win.",News/World news,America is now in fascism’s legal phase | Jason Stanley,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/america-fascism-legal-phase

Because according to its version of Swift’s 18th-century satire, although Lemuel Gulliver did once visit a land called Lilliput, the people there were not in fact very small. However, after he left, the Lilliputian king – a right royal nincompoop – decreed that Gulliver was a giant. So when he returns to Lilliput as a man of average stature he is arrested as an imposter. Which makes zero sense and the movie only gets sillier from there. Wayne Grayson voices Gulliver, a silver-tongued smarmy swashbuckler who sails the seas indulging in a bit of light plundering. One day he gets word from his mates on the island of Lilliput – who he once helped out of a jam – that they are under threat from an armada launched by neighbouring Blefuscu. So Gulliver rushes to Lilliput where he is sentenced to death for passing himself off as the Great Gulliver (since he left legend has rewritten him as a man mountain). Like I said, the plot is completely witless.  Meanwhile on Lilliput, time has been running at warp speed since Gulliver last visited, following an order by the king introducing “year days”, where all 365 days pass in a day. Quite how the mechanics of this work is never explained. But what it means is that while Gulliver has been gone for little over 12 months, in Lilliputian years four decades have passed. It’s maddeningly stupid. The biggest shame here is that Jonathan Swift’s story, like George Orwell’s Animal Farm, is gateway satire for kids, so easily adaptable to little laughs. Instead, six-year-olds are lumbered with this subpar knockabout gibberish, which has virtually nothing in common with the original other than the name of its hero. It’s not even as if the movie is much to look at either, with the plasticky pasteurised feel that ruins children’s television. The characters’ faces run the gamut of three or four emotions, and they move like marionette puppets. Gulliver Returns is released on 27 December on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,Gulliver Returns review – nonsensical animated take on Swift’s classic,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/22/gulliver-returns-review-swift-classic-satire
12/22/2021,"Grief totems aren’t always easy to rationalise. Once a loved one has departed, their footprints can be found everywhere and they often linger in the most unexpected places. A toothbrush casually discarded by the sink. An airline boarding pass shoved into a tatty paperback novel. A few months after my husband died in 2018, I found his credit card during a routine search for my trainers, and with a reverence one might pay a precious artefact, I stroked my fingers over the braille of his name before placing it back inside his wallet. “I’ve got ghosts on my phone,” the Bafta-winning writer, director and actor Mark Gatiss mused in an interview with the Radio Times. “I know this isn’t unique to me but I’ve lost my mum, my sister, my brother-in-law and now my dad, and there is something very odd about being orphaned, even at 54.”  Ghosts, phantoms, spectres. For the griever who has been left behind there can be strange comfort to be found in these random markers – the digital ones, too. There is an ethereal otherworldliness that can be seen on an iPhone screen. Speaking of this strange and haunting effect in grief – which is, at its heart, the everyday made holy – Gatiss described the jarring discord between “the curious feeling” and “the practicalities” that can follow a death. “Like I’ll never ring his telephone number again,” he said, referring to the recent loss of his father. And yet, in spite of this rational knowledge, he continued, “Occasionally, when I try to thin out my contacts, there are some numbers I just can’t delete.” Reading these comments, I was reminded of the day, about 10 months after his death, that I listened to voicemails left by my late husband. Countless messages that were still logged and listed on my iPhone; the recently departed mingling like ghostly wisps with the living – my mum, my best friend, the engineer cancelling our arranged boiler inspection next week. When I pressed on the symbol for loudspeaker, the mellow tones that were released seemed to float into the air like a supernatural substance from an enchanted lamp. These voice memos occupy a transitory space between the past and the present – and it can never be as straightforward as simply swiping a screen and pressing the option marked “delete”. There is no neat and linear way to grieve, despite what we’ve traditionally been told. In Patti Smith’s haunting memoir M Train, she writes about her late husband, Fred “Sonic” Smith, and the spells that can be cast by things. Fred’s favourite childhood toy was a red plastic cowboy, she tells us, and one day, when his mother was cleaning his room, it had simply disappeared. Fred came to believe that certain things “become part of our common treasure, occupying a special place in the Valley of Lost Things”. Echoing the nonsensical nature of loss, Smith asks: “Why is it that we lose the things we love, and things cavalier cling to us and will be the measure of our worth after we’re gone?” These days it’s a question that permeates our digital spaces, too. A different kind of treasure. Twitter threads and Instagram posts, WhatsApp groups and voice messages. It’s been three years since my husband died and my instruction to memorialise his Facebook page, a request that had to be accompanied by a screenshot of his death certificate, was only emailed to Mark Zuckerberg’s HQ a few weeks ago. In folklore, a ghost is usually a hazy, semi-transparent outline of a departed soul. In reality, apparitions can be all the fragments that make up the life you had, the person you love, and the memories you still treasure. A bank card hiding between the boxes of shoes. A number still logged on your “favourites” list. A bowlegged cowboy moulded from red plastic. Grief totems and beloved artefacts, our common treasure, occupying that special place between “here” and “there”, between “us” and “them”, the objects we cannot rationalise in the Valley of Lost Things.

12/22/2021,"Christmas was not traditional in my family growing up, so presents were intermittent. But the year I turned 18, I was welcomed into adulthood by a bumper stack of bestselling 90s dating books: Why Men Love Bitches and Men Are from Mars, Women are from Venus (and lesser-esteemed related reading, Why Men Marry Bitches and When Mars and Venus Collide). I had not known, until then, that I came across as the loneliest teenager in the world. Written in a tone that swung between “all-knowing best friend” and “extremely mean personal trainer telling you the suffering means it is working”, these books – overwhelmingly targeted at women – took the reader to an emotional bootcamp of sorts, telling them to buck up and put on much needed emotional armour in the hard-knuckled world of adult dating. There was contempt for the women who cared too much and loved too openly, which would scare men away (and the goal was always a man). Nice girls don’t get the guy. If your man is in a bad mood, let him stew in his man cave rather than be a nag. If you don’t respect yourself, he won’t respect you. The contempt, I think, was all the stronger because we were familiar with the type: weepy and prone to fits of hysteria; ready to throw off dignity at the first hint of true love, forever pining for a world more fantastical and beautiful. In other words, someone we all had in ourselves, to varying degrees, and felt all the more pathetic for. As Flaubert reportedly said, Madame Bovary, c’est moi.  I’m not sure how seriously I took those lessons back then, though they were nothing new in the teenage-girl media I read growing up – before the likes of Teen Vogue and Cosmopolitan were liberated to write explainers to Das Kapital, there were how-to guides on dieting, looking good and how to tell if he likes you or likes-likes you. The world may have moved on since then, but it’s hard to shake the lessons internalised when you’re young. Years later, in 2014, when I was exploring the world of Tinder, confronted with image after image of man holding fish, man quoting Drake lyric, man clearly wanting to be Drake, I too hardened my own armour, made clear that even though I was on here I too thought it was a bit of a joke (bio: “enthusiastic self-starter proficient in Microsoft Excel.”) The weepy romantic in me was locked up in the attic, only free to roam on select occasions. It’s a shame; I feel like life would be a lot more delightfully chaotic if she had the key.",Arts/Books,The book I got for Christmas: ‘An emotional bootcamp of sorts’,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/22/the-book-i-got-for-christmas-an-emotional-bootcamp-of-sorts
12/22/2021,"As a history professor at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, Kevin Bruyneel had been tested for Covid-19 more than 100 times and typically waited less than 15 minutes for the free tests. So Bruyneel was upset when he went to get a PCR test at a clinic Sunday in Brooklyn, New York, and waited more than an hour after his scheduled appointment and was billed at least $100 – though he could owe more depending on what his insurance covers.  “There were a lot of people in line, incredibly desperate to get tested because they were flying” for the holidays, said Bruyneel, who planned to fly to his native Vancouver, British Columbia, for Christmas. “There was a lot of anxiety.” Bruyneel’s experience is not unique in New York. People across the city are anxiously standing in line for hours outside testing sites because there aren’t enough tests to meet the increased demand due to the upcoming holidays, a surge in Covid cases and the emergence of the Omicron variant. On Monday, the Biden administration released plans to purchase 500m rapid tests to provide free to the public in January and to set up new federal testing sites. While public health experts praised the administration’s plan, they cautioned that the country needs more than 500m tests – and that the administration may have trouble even fulfilling that promise because of supply chain issues. “I’m really happy to see the administration modifying their plans and seeing new urgency to getting tests out to the public,” said Elizabeth Stuart, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “I think we have to recognize that 500m sounds like a lot of tests, but with 350 million people in the US, for regular use, we are still going to need more.” The problems with the United States’ Covid testing began at the onset of the pandemic, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention distributed faulty test kits to laboratories in February 2020. Then when vaccines became widely available in 2021 and the country saw a decrease in Covid cases, “everyone thought testing was going to be unnecessary, and we sort of had neglect, which turned out not to be benign”, said Dr Ezekiel Emanuel, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania who was on Joe Biden’s Covid advisory team during the transition. Things got so slow over the summer that Abbott Laboratories, an Illinois-based testing manufacturer, destroyed millions of Covid test cards; canceled contracts with suppliers; and closed a plant making the tests, according to the New York Times. While the number of test cards destroyed was relatively small when considering the total number of tests needed, “what it taught us is that we cannot be lulled into complacency,” said Mara Aspinall, a biomedical diagnostics professor at Arizona State University. “We have to keep up our vigilance until we go a long time without any new cases.” The US continues to lag behind places like Great Britain, where Covid tests are widely available, because the UK government placed greater focus on testing earlier in the pandemic and heavily subsidized the cost of testing in the country, Aspinall said. The UK’s public health system also allows them to distribute tests much more effectively, she said. “For many of the countries with nationalized health systems, this is not the first time they have sent health-related materials and products to their whole population, so as a result of that, the cost to doing it is lower and the logistics hurdle is lower,” said Aspinall. As a result, Bruyneel and others in New York City are standing in cold weather for hours outside clinics. The city has seen a 277% increase in Covid cases over the past two weeks, according to the Times, and public health officials expect that number to increase due to the highly infectious Omicron variant. On Tuesday afternoon, 18 of the city’s public hospitals and clinics had wait times of more than an hour, according to an NYC Health + Hospitals dashboard. To catch up, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must authorize more reliable over-the-counter rapid antigen tests, said Aspinall. In Europe, there are at least 46 over-the-counter Covid tests, Aspinall said. The FDA has only authorized a dozen, according to Kaiser Health News. “The challenge, however, is that we can’t lower the standards,” Aspinall said. “We can’t have tests coming out and have them be at a low standard and therefore not reliable.” To distribute the tests effectively, the federal government must also coordinate with state and local governments rather than having people order them through a website, as the administration has planned, said Jason Feldman, CEO of Vault Health, a virtual healthcare company that provides Covid tests. “I worry that the federal government managing a federal website is a disaster waiting to happen,” said Feldman, pointing to the bumpy rollout of Healthcare.gov, the health insurance exchange website created as part of the Affordable Care Act. The only way to distribute tests effectively “is through state and local government. You can’t have a federal government mailing tests to everybody’s homes. Think about the consequences of 350 million people in this country actively ordering tests.” The National Institutes of Health is already working with states to provide free at-home test kits to residents. For example, New Hampshire, population 1.3 million, offered 1m kits to residents and depleted the allotment in one day, according to the state health department. The state has not announced when they will offer more tests. While the federal government works to ramp up testing, people are trying to figure out when to test before holiday gatherings – or whether to gather at all. Bruyneel tested negative but still decided not to travel to Canada for the holiday because of the Omicron variant “It was tough on my Mom. She understood, but there were a lot of tears, and I feel guilty about it even if I know it’s the right decision,” he said. The long wait times are also not limited to New York. Until recently, Carly Angott, a videographer in Detroit, could just walk into an urgent care clinic without an appointment and quickly get a test. Angott gets tested regularly because she has asthma and allergies and works in the control room at Little Caesars Arena, which holds NBA and NHL games and other large events. Michigan now has the highest Covid hospitalization rate in the country. On Sunday, Angott was experiencing tightness in her chest and post-nasal drip, so she decided to get tested. This time she had to make an appointment. But on Monday, she still waited in her car for more than two hours after her scheduled appointment to get the test. Fortunately, the rapid test came back negative, but she is still waiting for the results of PCR test, which is more accurate but takes longer to process. Her Christmas celebration with her mom’s family has been canceled because a number of relatives have Covid. Now she just hopes to celebrate with her immediate family. “We are a little nervous, but I think more optimistic because everyone we know and love is boostered and doing OK for the most part,” said Angott, 24. “I am trying to remind myself of that, but it’s tough to not get dragged into the whirlwind of craziness.”",News/US news, ‘There’s a lot of anxiety’: US grapples with Covid testing amid surge ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/22/us-covid-test-lines-shortages
12/22/2021,"Eddie Jones has called for the tackle height to be lowered in youth rugby union in order to further reduce the risk of brain injuries in the sport. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Jones said that while he felt rugby was “moving in the right direction” on the issue, and that he was happy with the way it was being handled at the elite level, one change he would like to see is for it to be mandatory for all under-12 players to only tackle below the hips.  “We 100% need to protect and minimise contact with the head,” said England’s head coach. “That’s paramount for rugby going forward.” The current Rugby Football Union rule is that all tackles in under-18 rugby need to be below the armpits, but the governing body is also experimenting with a waist-high law in some under-16 and under-18 games this season. Jones would lower it further still for younger players. “I think it is moving in the right direction. The only thing I would change is that I would say that at under-12 [level], everyone has got to tackle under the hips. Teach people how to tackle under the hips from an early age, and make that their normal, trademark tackle, I think in that way we can protect the head even more and that’s really important.” Jones says the game needs “to learn from what’s gone on, and make sure we are proactive [about this issue] in the growth of the sport”. He would also like to see World Rugby put in place a system to make sure former players who have been diagnosed with diseases related to brain trauma are being looked after. “I think World Rugby is trying to do that, to put in place a system where those people can be cared for properly, and I think that’s really important,” he said. “You’d hope that post the next World Cup, where obviously they make their profits to run the game for the next period of time, a proportion of the funds would be apportioned to looking after those players who have suffered that damage.” Jones has been struck by how many former northern hemisphere forwards have been diagnosed. “That makes a lot of sense, doesn’t it? If you think about the amount of collisions northern hemisphere forwards have had compared to southern hemisphere forwards in the previous period, it is probably higher because of the volume of games they’ve played. Traditionally players here have played 35 games a year, whereas in the southern hemisphere you probably played 25, so the volume of games, the number of collisions, all of that could contribute to it. But no one knows for sure, obviously. “I think World Rugby is doing all the right things, and if we can look after those players who have been damaged better then I think we will be in a pretty good spot.”",Sport/Sport,‘Tackle below the hips’: Eddie Jones calls for youth rugby rule change ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/22/tackle-below-the-hips-eddie-jones-calls-for-youth-rugby-union-rule-change-brain-injuries
12/22/2021,"Plans for New Year’s Eve parties in England may have to be scrapped, a minister has admitted, as she said there remained uncertainty over the severity of illness caused by the Omicron variant of Covid-19. Gillian Keegan, the care minister, refused to rule out lockdown measures being introduced in England shortly after Christmas and said 129 people had been hospitalised and 14 had died with Omicron in the UK.  “There is uncertainty. So, if you can’t change your [New Year’s Eve] plans quickly, then maybe think about it. There is uncertainty. We can’t predict what the data is going to tell us before we’ve got the data,” she said. She told LBC Radio that the government’s approach in England had been to try to allow people to go ahead with Christmas plans, but that the same could not necessarily be said of the following holiday. Boris Johnson has said no new measures will be put in place in England before Christmas Day, but the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales are introducing some new restrictions before and after the holiday. Keegan told Sky News: “We do not have all the information that you would like to have at your fingertips, in particular … the severity of the disease. So it is a difficult balance but we think we’ve got the balance right. You know, saying to the country we wanted to lock down etc, when you’ve got those kind of figures wouldn’t look proportionate.” She said the decision that was taken on further restrictions was “difficult”. Asked whether there was any chance a “circuit breaker” lockdown might be avoided if the country continued on its current path, Keegan said: “We are waiting for data on the severity, we’ll still have to wait to see where we land on that, but we can’t really say, you know. “What we’ve said is: up to Christmas, we’re fine, looking at the data, looking at the numbers we have at the moment. But, of course, we have to look at where this virus goes, where this variant goes, so we have to look at that data. I can’t tell you in advance of getting that data, but you should be cheerful because we’re doing a lot more than we could last year. We’re able to see our families.” Keegan acknowledged that Johnson was refusing to act based on the same data that had led first ministers elsewhere in the UK to take preventive measures, but she claimed this was not a result of indecision or political calculation. She was asked on Times Radio if the issue was not Johnson’s “own political judgment and that he doesn’t want to do anything with the data that all the leaders are seeing”. Keegan said: “If we see large jumps in the data, large jumps in hospitalisation … then of course we’ll react. But we don’t actually have that yet. So what [Scotland’s Nicola Sturgeon and Wales’s Mark Drakeford are] doing is … they’re looking at the risk and they’re coming up with a different answer.” After Johnson’s announcement of no new restrictions in the short term in England, the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, said people would be “breathing a sigh of relief that Christmas is going ahead as planned”. But he said: “The country also deserves some certainty about what comes after Christmas so that families and businesses can plan ahead.” He added: “The virus won’t be taking Christmas off and there’s still a risk of the NHS being overwhelmed in the new year. Boris Johnson is too weak to get any measures to keep the country safe through his cabinet.” Keegan also defended the government’s decision to reduce the isolation period from 10 days to seven for anyone in England – whether vaccinated or unvaccinated – who records a negative lateral flow test result for both the sixth and seventh day. The change in the rules will be introduced from Wednesday. Speaking to Times Radio on Wednesday morning, Keegan talked up the benefits of releasing such people early, saying it would allow many to enjoy their Christmas lunch. But she insisted the government was not seeking positive headlines at Christmas, having been forced to cancel last year’s celebrations. She said health officials believed releasing people with consecutive negative tests after seven days represented a similar risk to releasing everyone after 10.",News/Politics,"New Year’s Eve plans in England may have to be cancelled, says minister",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/22/new-years-eve-plans-in-england-may-have-to-be-cancelled-says-minister
12/22/2021,"Thousands of people who bought leasehold homes from the housebuilder Taylor Wimpey will be liberated from terms where their ground rent charges doubled every 10 years, after a long-running investigation by the UK competition watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been looking into the contractual cost increases imposed by Taylor Wimpey and other property developers, which have left some owners struggling to sell or mortgage their homes, while their rights to their property can also be at risk if they fall behind on ground rent payments.  Taylor Wimpey has voluntarily given formal commitments to the CMA that it will remove terms from leasehold contracts that cause ground rents to double in price. The company has also agreed to remove terms from contacts that had previously been converted, so that the ground rent increased in line with the higher retail prices index measure of inflation. As a result, affected leaseholders’ ground rents will remain at the amount charged when they first bought their home and will not increase over time. Taylor Wimpey has also confirmed to the CMA that it has stopped selling leasehold properties with doubling ground rent clauses. Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s chief executive, called the announcement “a huge step forward for leaseholders with Taylor Wimpey”. He said: “These are totally unwarranted obligations that lead to people being trapped in their homes, struggling to sell or obtain a mortgage.” The CMA launched enforcement action against four housing developers in September 2020 – Countryside, Taylor Wimpey, Barratt Developments and Persimmon Homes – which it believes may have broken consumer protection law in relation to leasehold homes. In March, the CMA ordered Taylor Wimpey and developer Countryside Properties to remove the terms in their contracts, and wrote to them giving them the opportunity to sign formal commitments, known as undertakings, to remove the terms from contracts. Countryside Properties said in September that it was voluntarily removing the terms from its contracts. The housebuilder Persimmon also agreed at the time to offer leasehold homeowners the opportunity to buy the freehold of their property at a discounted price, and to make repayments to some homeowners who bought their freeholds. In addition, the insurance group Aviva, which bought freeholds from developers, agreed in June to remove ground rent terms that were considered unfair and repay homeowners whose rents doubled after the CMA’s investigation. Of the four housebuilders against whom the CMA launched enforcement action in September 2020, only the investigation into Barratt Developments is still ongoing. Coscelli said the CMA was prepared to take further action against companies. “Other developers and freehold investors should now do the right thing for homeowners and remove these problematic clauses from their contracts. If they refuse, we stand ready to step in and take further action – through the courts if necessary,” he said. Taylor Wimpey’s chief executive, Pete Redfern, said: “Taylor Wimpey has always sought to do the right thing by its customers, shareholders and other stakeholders, and we are pleased that today’s voluntary undertakings will draw this issue to a full close, within our original financial provision.” The company said it was making a financial offer, agreed with the CMA, to third-party freeholders of leases that Taylor Wimpey no longer owns, to enable their leaseholders revert to a fixed ground rent. As part of its review into the leasehold sector, the CMA is continuing its investigation into two investment groups, Brigante Properties, and Abacus Land and Adriatic Land.",News/Business,Taylor Wimpey drops costly leasehold terms after investigation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/22/taylor-wimpey-drops-costly-leasehold-terms-after-investigation
12/22/2021,"As the US supreme court prepares to decide a case that could deny women the right to abortion in much of the US, Latin American activists like me are holding our collective breaths. The continent has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world, in spite of recent progressive reforms in the past decade in countries including Uruguay and Argentina.  The end of Roe v Wade would deliver a frightening message throughout the region. El Salvador’s courts have sentenced women who have had a miscarriage to 30 years in prison – treating an obstetric emergency as an abortion. In Honduras, where abortion is already illegal in all circumstances, congress amended the constitution to state that life starts at conception. Against this dismal legal backdrop, Roe v Wade has long been a source of inspiration to women in Latin America fighting for their basic rights. It has given us a strategic model as well as strong legal arguments against constitutional obstacles. Like women in the US, we have taken our cases to court, sometimes securing significant and progressive gains in the last decade. In Colombia, the constitutional court ruled in 2006 that women could have an abortion in cases involving rape or incest, when it posed a risk to the pregnant person’s life or health or when the foetus was diagnosed with severe malformations. In Brazil, the supreme court in 2012 authorised abortion if a foetus is found to have anencephaly, a condition that leads to miscarriage, or death in the first weeks of life. And the court is considering another case that could decriminalise all abortions in the first 12 weeks. Most recently, the Mexican supreme court declared the criminalisation of abortion unconstitutional and mandated that state legislatures across the country act on that ruling. In all of these cases, activists drew on the arguments in Roe v Wade for their successful litigation strategy and judges cited the landmark case and related rulings in making their decisions. If the US state of Mississippi succeeds in overturning Roe v Wade after nearly 50 years, we will lose this crucial legal precedent and endanger progress on reproductive rights throughout Latin America. Just this month, the Brazilian senate approved the nomination of a conservative Christian pastor to the country’s supreme court. President Jair Bolsonaro’s choice is expected to oppose expanding abortion rights. One glimmer of hope for Americans is the US Food and Drug Administration’s decision last week to permanently lift restrictions on the abortion pill. This reaffirms that Latin American activists have long made the right choice to bet on self-managed abortion for ensuring access while waiting for rights to be granted through the legislative process. Funders must now expand their support for these direct action strategies throughout the Americas. But few are willing to associate their names with an issue as stigmatised as abortion, which means financial backing is scarce for activists working to expand rights and access. Philanthropists in the US have been fundamental to our success, and they will most likely want to redirect their funding to American organisations if the era of Roe v Wade does come to an end. They would be right to do so, but it would be a mistake to turn away from organisations and activists in other parts of the world that have made so much progress. Emboldened by anti-gender movements, powerful forces have swept Latin America, Europe and Africa, seeking to undermine the quest for greater sexual and reproductive freedom – particularly access to abortion and birth control – for the women who are least likely to advocate for themselves. We cannot fight them alone. Funding community-based self-managed abortion initiatives in countries where access is highly restricted may be the only way to save women’s lives while we battle repressive policies on multiple fronts across the global south. It may require funders to be less prescriptive in supporting our reproductive justice struggles, and to trust local advocates and the solutions we propose. Doing so will make clear that the lives of women matter, no matter who we are or where we live. We may lose Roe, but never the commitment to our fight.

12/22/2021,"Liverpool’s captain, Jordan Henderson, is concerned that player welfare is not being taken seriously enough. The Premier League announced on Monday its intention to continue with the scheduled matches over the Christmas period, even though there were 90 confirmed coronavirus cases among players and staff last week. A shareholders’ meeting involving representatives from all 20 clubs came to a collective decision to carry on, despite six of the 10 games last weekend being off because of Covid outbreaks.  “I don’t think people can appreciate how intense it is until you actually see it first-hand,” Henderson told BBC Sport. “Football to us is everything and we want to be able to perform at the highest level every time we set foot on the pitch. And unfortunately, in this period it is difficult to do that. “That has been like this for a few years now and it has been difficult but then, on top of that, you chuck in Covid and it becomes even harder and even worse. I am concerned that nobody really takes player welfare seriously. “I think decisions get made – of course we want to play as footballers, we want to get out there and play – but I am worried about player welfare and I don’t think anybody does take that seriously enough, especially in this period, when Covid is here. “We will try to have conversations in the background and try to have some sort of influence going forward, but at the minute I don’t feel the players get the respect they deserve in terms of having somebody being able to speak for them independently and having the power to say actually this isn’t right for player welfare.” Liverpool were without a number of key players for last Sunday’s 2-2 draw at Tottenham, including Virgil Van Dijk, Fabinho and Thiago. Including that game, they have five games in two weeks. Liverpool’s assistant manager, Pepijn Lijnders, has described the decision to press on with the Premier League’s festive schedule as “absurd” and warned it will increase the risk to players’ health.",Sport/Football,‘This isn’t right’: Liverpool’s Jordan Henderson voices player welfare fears,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/22/liverpool-jordan-henderson-voices-player-welfare-fears-covid
