3/27/2022,"Elon Musk told Axel Springer CEO Mathias Döpfner that the US has ""very, very ancient leadership."" ""For a democracy to function, the leaders must be reasonably in touch with the bulk of the population,"" he said. Musk said he'd like to see political leaders be within 10-20 years of the average population age. Tesla CEO Elon Musk in a recent interview said that the United States has a ""very, very ancient leadership"" and questioned how leading figures can ""stay in touch with the people"" if they are several generations removed from most of the population. The comments from the electric vehicle and clean energy company leader came this week during a conversation with Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California. Musk spoke about everything from Russian President Vladimir Putin to revelations that he sometimes feels ""lonely,"" but he had pointed criticism for leaders whom he feels are disconnected from their citizenry. When Musk was asked about humans having ""a significantly increased lifespan,"" he offered a straightforward view about human life. ""I don't think we should try to have people live for a really long time,"" he told Döpfner. ""That it would cause asphyxiation of society because the truth is, most people don't change their mind. They just die."" He continued: ""So if they don't die, we will be stuck with old ideas and society wouldn't advance."" Musk then said that a ""gerontocracy"" — where a government is essentially controlled by citizens significantly older than the bulk of the population — is not healthy. ""I think we already have quite a serious issue with gerontocracy, where the leaders of so many countries are extremely old,"" he revealed. ""In the US, it's a very, very ancient leadership. And it is just impossible to stay in touch with the people if you are many generations older than them."" He added: ""The founders of the USA put minimum ages for a local office. But they did not put maximum ages because they did not expect that people will be living so long. They should have. Because for a democracy to function, the leaders must be reasonably in touch with the bulk of the population. And if you're too young or too old, you can't say that you will be attached."" Musk said that he'd like to see political leaders ""be ideally within 10 or at least, 20 years of the average age of the population."" He said that while he would like to sustain good health over an extended period of time, he doesn't fear death. ""I am not afraid of dying. I think it would come as a relief,"" he said in the interview. Over the course of President Joe Biden's tenure, Musk — who seemed pumped about the administration's push to combat climate change early last year — began to criticize Biden, who is 79, over his failure to include Tesla in the national conversation about electric vehicles. In January, the billionaire on Twitter blasted Biden as ""a damp sock puppet in human form."" Last month, the president during a speech called Tesla the country's ""largest electric-vehicle manufacturer"" after facing repeated criticism for not acknowledging the company as a leader in the automotive industry.

3/27/2022,"By Jason Hovet PRAGUE (Reuters) - Thousands of Russians marched through Prague on Saturday, waving the white-blue-white flag that has become a symbol of protests against Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Carrying signs that read ""Killer"" over a picture of President Vladimir Putin and chanting ""No to War"", protesters walked from Prague's Peace Square through the centre of the Czech capital. Police put the number of marchers at about 3,000. ""We are against Putin,"" said Alexander Sibrimov, a 19-year-old student who attended the protest with his father. ""We don't agree with his politics. This is a way to show the world that the things happening in Ukraine are not right."" Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its neighbour, and denies targeting civilians. Ukraine and its Western allies have called that a baseless pretext for an unprovoked invasion. The Czech Republic is home to 45,000 Russians, the fourth largest foreign community in the former communist-ruled country. Nearly 200,000 Ukrainians lived in the Czech Republic - making them the biggest foreign community - before Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. The Czech government estimates 300,000 Ukrainians have fled to the country. ""This is an act to show the Czech Republic and the Czech people that Russians (are) against Putin,"" protest organiser Anton Litvin said. The protesters in Prague said they believed they were reflecting what many people in Russia feel but are unable to say. ""Just because we are Russians doesn't mean we are automatically for the war. We are against the war,"" said protester Oleg Golopyatov, a former soldier who has lived in Prague for 15 years. ""Ukraine is a normal country. It is terrible (what is happening there).""

Scientists may have discovered the secret social lives of great white sharks, a new study reveals. While tracking multiple great whites, a team of researchers says it found that some would stick together for more than an hour when patrolling areas around Guadalupe Island. The reason they roam in groups may be simple, yet scary. Apparently, the sharks may have discovered that they can kill larger prey when they work as a team. The results were published in a new study.

The group of researchers, including Florida International University marine scientist Yannis Papastamatiou, say they wanted to learn more about the white sharks that gather around Guadalupe Island each year. The waters around the island are teeming with tuna and seals, which makes it a living buffet for the sharks. To study them, the team created a “super social tag”. This tag allowed them to track the sharks. They were also able to capture video footage of them using an array of different sensors. These sensors showed them depth, direction, and even how quickly the sharks turned when swimming. The secret weapon of the tracker, though, was the sensor that detected nearby sharks with tags issued during previous studies. The new tags were designed to collect data for up to five days. Then, once the five days were completed, the tags would pop off the dorsal fin and float to the surface of the water for collecting. Altogether the team tagged six great white sharks, three males and three females, throughout a four-year period. Following a study into the data collected by the “super social tags”, researchers discovered that some sharks would gather in groups to patrol around the island. Many of the interactions were short, never lasting more than seven minutes or so. However, some sharks chose to stay together and hunt for more than an hour. This data about the secret social lives of great white sharks is a huge step towards understanding how these marine predators live. There’s a lot we still don’t understand about these animals because it’s so difficult to study them without being noticed. For example, in 2018, scientists were trying to understand why a bunch of sharks kept gathering at one spot in the middle of nowhere. The tracker also gave the researchers a good look at the shark’s different hunting habits. For example, some great whites preferred to hunt in deeper water, while others stayed in shallow areas. Even more, some chose to hunt at night, while others hunted during the day. The footage of the sharks hunting also showed multiple attempts where the prey managed to get away from the sharks. This isn’t abnormal, as predators do not always manage to catch their prey when hunting. However, Papastamatiou says it could help prove why great white sharks congregate together at times (via Phys.org). Ultimately, though, there’s still a lot that we don’t understand. Technology may have helped give us a glimpse at the secret social lives of great white sharks, but we still don’t know why these sharks choose to be social. Papastamatiou says they aren’t necessarily doing it to work together. Instead, it may just be a way of sharing information, should one shark manage to kill some large prey while the others were unsuccessful. Click here to read the full article.
