12/17/2021,"A man feels like his fiancee might just be using him for his money. He asked Reddit’s “Relationship Advice” forum for help. After he and his fiancee got engaged, he paid off $75,000 of her debts. Since he has given her the money, she has spent less and less time with him. Now he wonders if she was only ever interested in his bank account. “I don’t care when my fiancee Hannah goes out with her friends or does whatever,” he said. “But for the last few months, I really feel like I have taken a back seat to her priorities. Hannah has been in some deep financial s*** for years. I do very well financially.” “Once we got engaged, I did a real big overhaul of her financial debt. She went from being $75,000 in debt to being 100% debt-free and owning a car. I was happy to do it, as we are spending our lives together, and once that was solid, I went ahead and pulled the trigger.” No matter how much he pleaded with her, Hannah never seemed interested in making him a priority. “She has reduced the time [for] seeing me to once a week (we don’t live together yet, as we are building a home together and our individual leases aren’t up until the home is finished),” he explained. “And I have [told] her that I would really like to hang out with her more. She just blames it on her busy schedule or says sure, but it really just doesn’t happen.” “I feel like I have nagged her to the bone in a nice way and also abrasive ways that I don’t feel like a priority — that I am being put on the back burner. But if she wants something or money, then I am suddenly just her angel. I am about to lose my shit. I’m not cool with spending four hours a week with my fiancee. She knows this, but apparently, it doesn’t sink in. It’s like she got the money she needed, and now I am just her piggy bank.” Redditors confirmed the man’s suspicions. “If for any reason you end up marrying this woman, who is obviously just using you, make sure you get a prenup to protect your assets. You’re already seeing HUGE red flags even before marriage,” a user wrote. “Don’t make a more expensive mistake marrying her,” another said. “Leave her immediately,” someone added.

12/17/2021,"Mitch McConnell said delaying Biden's agenda is ""the best Christmas gift"" for working families. Senate Democrats seem to be focusing on passing voting rights legislation before Christmas instead. This angered House progressives who argued the two bills should be equally prioritized. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's goal to pass President Joe Biden's Build Back Better agenda before Christmas is in jeopardy following reports Senate Democrats are turning their focus to passing voting rights legislation before the end of the year instead. This news angered a number of House progressive lawmakers, but it was music to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's ears. ""Yesterday, we got indications that the far left's slapdash sprint may be hitting the pause button,"" McConnell said during Thursday remarks on the Senate floor. ""Well, that would certainly be great news for the American people. The best Christmas gift Washington could give working families would be putting this bad bill on ice."" McConnell and his Republican colleagues have long opposed Democrats' plan to spend $1.75 trillion on Biden's sweeping climate and social-spending bill, saying they're concerned it would add to the already spiking inflation in the country. That's a concern that centrist Democrat of West Virginia Joe Manchin has shared on numerous occasions, frequently expressing the need to pause passing Biden's agenda until inflation is under control. As Insider's Joseph Zeballos-Roig reported on Wednesday, Manchin all but sank Democrats' hopes of getting the bill passed before Christmas due to reports claiming he opposed a one-year expansion of the child tax credit in the bill, which provides families with up to $300 per kid a month. Manchin later denounced those reports as ""bullshit,"" but his Democratic colleagues in the Senate said they felt blindsided there was even a discussion surrounding cutting the benefit for families; the credit was included in the House version of the bill that recently passed. ""I'm very, very surprised because I thought that there was an agreement on this,"" Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, an architect of the program, told Insider. Regardless of what makes it into the final version of the Senate's bill, a number of House progressives came out in opposition to the idea that passing voting rights legislation should take Build Back Better's place. ""It is unacceptable that discussion of further delays to the passage of the Build Back Better Act is being framed as a choice between this legislation and voting rights,"" Missouri Rep. Cori Bush said in a statement. Bush was one of the six Democrats who voted against the infrastructure bill's passage because she wanted the social-spending bill to be passed at the same time. New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman expressed a similar sentiment on Wednesday, saying ""there is not good enough reason"" to delay the bill's passage. ""It has now been 26 days since the House did its job to deliver on President Biden's full agenda and passed the Build Back Better Act,"" Bowman said in a statement. ""Now, we are faced with a false choice between saving our democracy from the existential threat of fascism and meeting the immediate needs of the people.""

12/17/2021,"The Omicron variant has been detected in 37 U.S. states, less than three weeks after the World Health Organization (WHO) named it a variant of concern.  The WHO warned that this variant, also known as B.1.1.529, has coincided with a ""steep"" rise in COVID-19 infections in South Africa, where it was first detected. ""This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning,"" it said in a statement, before reminding people to follow known COVID-19 mitigation strategies like getting vaccinated against the virus, avoiding crowded spaces, trying to practice physical distancing and wearing well-fitting masks.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is also warning about Omicron, noting that ""we don’t yet know how easily it spreads, the severity of illness it causes or how well available vaccines and medications work against it."" While the CDC notes that vaccines ""remain the best public health measure to protect people from COVID-19,"" the agency also points out that ""masks offer protection against all variants,"" before urging people to wear them in public indoor areas where there is ""substantial or high community transmission,"" regardless of your vaccination status.  It's been a year and a half since the American public was first encouraged to wear masks to protect against COVID-19, and since then mask mandates across the country have been spotty. Some businesses, including many doctor's offices, require you to wear them indoors, while mask mandates are forbidden in other places, like the state of Florida. With the rise of Omicron, the continuing circulation of the infectious Delta variant and cases of COVID-19 continuing to rise across the country, it's only natural to have questions about masks as we move into the thick of the holiday season. Are cloth masks still up to snuff? Should we all be in N95 equivalents, like KF94s and KN95s? Here's what the experts say. The CDC recommends that masks have the following: Two or more layers of breathable material Complete coverage of your nose and mouth Fits snuggly against your face without gaps Has a nose wire to prevent air from leaking out of the top of the mask Another requirement that wasn't listed by the CDC? Comfort. ""Can you wear the masks for a long period of time, which is typically how breathable it is, and is it a good design?"" Aaron Collins, a mechanical engineer in Minnesota and self-described ""citizen engineer"" who has been studying mask efficiency, tells Yahoo Life. This is crucial to ensuring that your mask is actually worn, and worn correctly, he says. ""Cloth masks are indeed good if they are several layers and fit well,"" Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. But, he points out, ""we can't solely rely on them, just as we don't rely only on vaccines."" Still, Dr. Prathit Kulkarni, assistant professor of medicine in infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine, tells Yahoo Life that ""there is some evidence that surgical face masks are potentially a bit better than cloth masks."" A study that was just published in the journal Science analyzed data from 342,183 adults in Bangladesh and found that surgical masks were 95 percent effective at filtering out virus particles, compared with 37 percent for cloth face masks.  ""Cloth masks are our 1918 pandemic technology, used 100 years ago,"" Collins says. ""We have the technology — the high filtration, electrostatically charged, meltblown [masks like KF94s, KN95s and N95s] — and we should use it."" That doesn't mean cloth face masks don't have a role in protecting you. Dr. Thomas Russo, professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York, tells Yahoo Life that not all cloth face masks are created equal, and having features like a metal nose wire, three layers, and insertable filters will quickly ramp up protection. ""I favor using the highest quality mask that fits well and you are comfortable wearing for a prolonged period of time,"" he says.  Again, a recent study found that surgical masks have the potential to provide great protection, but Kulkarni says the right fit is crucial with these. Your surgical mask should be ""snugly fitting while not impeding breathing,"" he says.  ""Surgical masks have the technology in them — the electrostatically charged meltblown — but they lack the fit,"" Collins says. ""They are not designed to seal closely to the face."" Surgical face masks aren't for everyone, he says, noting that they also have a ""major annoyance"" that they can ""suck into your mouth, making it even harder to breathe"" when you're doing things like climbing stairs or breathing hard.  Double masking had a moment, but there hasn't been much information to suggest that this is necessary if you have a mask with multiple layers. ""There is no strong data to support universal double masking at this point,"" Kulkarni says. ""The key concept is that the mask should have a snug but still comfortable fit."" Collins calls double masking ""the worst solution,"" adding, ""if you can make it work, it is very hard to breathe in."" Think: at an airport, on a bus or in the mall. Collins is a big fan of using stronger filtration masks, like KF94s, the South Korean version of an N95 mask, and KN95s, the Chinese version of an N95 mask. (The CDC still recommends that N95 masks be reserved for health care workers.) ""At this point, KF94s, KN95s and N95s are a no-brainer,"" he says. ""We have tons of them, they are very inexpensive now and provide way better protection than a surgical or cloth mask."" Collins says his tests have found that these masks can be reworn for up to 40 hours in a ""clean, office-type environment with very little reduction in filtration efficiency."" While Collins swears these masks are comfortable, not everyone agrees. ""KN95, KF94 or N95 masks are indeed more protective than the conventional mask, but they're fitted much tighter if you wear them correctly and they do make breathing harder,"" Schaffner says. ""Lots of people feel a bit claustrophobic in them. We generally don't recommend them because we're afraid they will discourage people from wearing masks."" But, if you feel comfortable using a KF94 or KN95, Russo says to go on ahead. ""If not and a high-quality cloth mask — triple layer with a filter — works for you, that is fine,"" he says. ""Even a less-than-optimal quality mask is better than no mask."" Overall, experts say the rules of good masking aren’t expected to change with Omicron, although the situation is still developing.
