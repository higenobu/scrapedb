1/7/2022,"The first person in the UK to catch a new strain of bird flu has been named as 79-year-old Alan Gosling, a retired engineer who lived with around 20 ducks inside his home in Devon. Gosling, who had around another 100 ducks living outside on his property in Buckfastleigh, noticed several ducks falling ill shortly before Christmas, Devon Live reports.  Subsequent tests by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha) were returned positive for the H5N1 strain of avian flu. They were subsequently killed shortly after Christmas. Gosling then tested positive for general flu virus and the H5N1 strain of avian flu – a first for the strain in the UK. The risk to the wider public continues to be very low, health officials have said, but people have been urged to not touch sick or dead birds. Gosling reportedly welcomed about 20 of the birds into his home as pets after he began feeding the flock. His daughter-in-law, Ellesha Gosling, from Cranbrook, told Devon Live how Gosling begged for their lives to be spared and described the Muscovy ducks as his best friends. She said: “The past couple of weeks have been hell for this family. He saw all of his ducks killed, and they were like his closest friends.” The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) confirmed on Thursday that a person in the south-west of England had tested positive for bird flu. In a statement, the health protection body said: “Bird-to-human transmission of avian flu is very rare and has only occurred a small number of times in the UK previously. “The person acquired the infection from very close, regular contact with a large number of infected birds, which they kept in and around their home over a prolonged period of time. “All contacts of the individual, including those who visited the premises, have been traced and there is no evidence of onward spread of the infection to anyone else. The individual is currently well and self-isolating.” The UK has recently seen a large number of bird flu outbreaks among animals, with the UK’s chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, issuing warnings to bird owners over hygiene. There are currently 64 cases of avian influenza H5N1 in England, according to Defra, with new cases being confirmed on a daily basis. There are also a number of cases in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The whole of the UK is covered by avian influenza prevention zones, which require bird keepers to take measures to try to stop the disease’s spread, such as housing or netting all poultry and captive birds to keep them separate from wild birds, and disinfecting clothing and equipment. Some strains of bird flu can pass from birds to people, but this is extremely rare, according to the UKHSA. It usually requires close contact with an infected bird, so the risk to humans is generally considered very low. Human-to-human transmission of bird flu is also very rare, the organisation said. This was the first human case of the strain in the UK, the organisation said, although there have been cases elsewhere globally.",News/World news,First UK person to catch H5N1 bird flu strain is named,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/first-uk-person-to-catch-h5n1-bird-flu-strain-is-named
1/7/2022,"This week’s acquittal of four people over the toppling the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston was hailed by many as an exemplar of the jury system in action, although there were significant dissenters. Conservative MPs variously said the verdict undermined the rule of law and that they were deeply concerned by the precedent it set. For Mike Schwarz, a partner at Hodge, Jones and Allen and a veteran in representing protesters – including 28 Greenpeace activists cleared in 2001 of causing criminal damage despite admitting destroying a crop of genetically modified maize – that reaction was all too familiar.  “I remember just after one of the Greenpeace cases, over a decade ago, there was a front page of the old G2 environment section of the Guardian where there was a big picture of a protest and a banner headline posing the question whether the verdict meant a ‘free for all’ [for direct action protests],” he said. “And when I saw the reaction to Colston I had flashbacks to those times. Now, as then, there was a concern – outrage, even – from the more reactionary parts of the political spectrum about activists being able to do what they want and juries acquitting them.” He said governments and businesses never liked juries acquitting protesters who had admitted damage or disruption, but it was not a new phenomenon and had not caused a free for all. Even before the GM crops case, in 1996 a Liverpool jury acquitted two women charged with causing £1.5m damage to a Hawk fighter jet. They admitted the damage but said they had acted to prevent its use in the bombing of East Timor by Indonesia, which contravened international law. Schwartz, who represented six climate crisis activists acquitted last month for a protest that halted the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) in London’s financial district, said the lesson from Colston was that “juries are the safest pair of hands to deal with issues about the lawful scope of protest and concerns about what government or business do. This is the rule of law in action.” Martin Porter, a coordinator of Greenpeace’s Manchester branch and one of those cleared in the GM crops case, also dismissed the idea of dangerous precedents being set. “In our case it was a government that was clearly going against public opinion in the way it was allowing GM crops, and in this case Bristol council had not taken any action over community outrage at the statue,” he said. “We were only asking for acquittal for what we did, not a carte blanche to go and do it anywhere else. In our case the evidence was around the things we’d done beforehand to try and get this crop stopped, and in the Colston case it was the campaigns that had been going on for years to try and get this statue removed.” Ian Bray, a co-founder of Extinction Rebellion (XR) who has twice been acquitted by jurors – once in the DLR trial and once in April last year after damaging Shell’s London headquarters – said juries understood that “not all damage is the same” but it also came down to luck. “It’s like pulling the lever of a fruit machine and you’re hoping for three pineapples,” he said. “You’ve got to get at least three jurors who won’t convict. If you’ve only got two, the other 10 are a majority who can convict, but you can’t have a nine-to-three majority.” Bray said it was a deliberate tactic of XR to get trials before juries – there are a string of cases delayed by Covid – in the hope that they prove more sympathetic than magistrates. To that end, in the action against Shell he said they aimed to cause just over £5,000 damage to meet the threshold for a crown court trial but avoid the risk of heavy sentencing, only to be charged with £25,000 of damage. “It’s very hard to calculate,” said Bray. Schwarz and a fellow HJA partner, Raj Chada, who represented two of the Colston four, believe the defence of protesters has been boosted by a supreme court ruling last year. In June the UK’s highest court quashed the convictions of Nora Ziegler and three others who had formed a blockade outside a London arms fair, saying there must be a test of “proportionality” weighing up the defendants’ rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly against the disruption caused. The defence of proportionality was subsequently used in the DLR and Colston cases. By contrast, in the Shell case, which was pre-Ziegler, the judge said there was no defence in law. However, the Shell defendants were still acquitted. It illustrates that for all the government talk of closing loopholes to prevent a repeat of the Colston decision, and Boris Johnson and Priti Patel encouraging prosecution of protesters, while there is a right to jury trial – something the government has itself proposed strengthening in a new bill of rights – juries will always have the right to acquit where they see fit. Kirsty Brimelow QC, the vice-chair of the Criminal Bar Association, said: “This wasn’t a rebellion. The verdict was within the law. Juries will continue making their decisions on the lives of those placed in their hands on the facts of the cases and within the protection of the law for both defendants and prosecution. The verdict should not be traduced by politics. “Taxpayers may prefer their money to be directed at the causes of the protests: they are big causes such as the climate crisis, the erasure of black history and historic and present atrocities and violence against women and girls.”",News/Law,Lawyers jump to juries’ defence as Tories fume at Colston Four verdict,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/07/lawyers-jump-to-juries-defence-as-tories-fume-at-colston-four-verdict
1/7/2022,"Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, was paid nearly $100m (£74m) last year, a 570% increase on the previous year, according to regulatory filings. Cook, 61, who took over as chief executive from the Apple founder Steve Jobs in 2011, also gained access to share awards worth about $750m as the iPhone maker’s market value approaches $3tn.  His total compensation for the year to September 2021 was $98.7m, up from $14.7m the previous year, filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) show. Cook’s pay was 1,447 times that paid to the average Apple employee, who collected a median average of $68,254, the company said. His 2021 pay was boosted by a $82.3m stock award bonus related to Apples’ soaring share price. His base salary was $3m, he also collected $12m in bonuses for hitting the company’s financial and environmental sustainability goals. The filings also show Apple spent more than $700,000 on private flights for Cook, as the company has decided it is too much of a security risk to allow him to fly on scheduled commercial flights. The company also paid hundreds of thousands in personal security, pension contributions, life insurance and buying back unused holiday time. “It’s been a remarkable decade for Apple and in 2021 Mr Cook was granted an equity award for the first time since he was promoted to CEO in August 2011,” Apple said in the filing. Cook, who is sitting on a personal fortune of more than $1bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has said he plans to give away all of his fortune before he dies. In 2015, he told Fortune magazine that he planned to donate all of his wealth to charity after providing for his then 10-year-old nephew’s education.",News/Technology,"Apple boss Tim Cook was paid nearly $100m last year, filings show",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/07/apple-boss-tim-cook-was-paid-nearly-100m-last-year-filings-show
1/7/2022,"Mouths agape, we’ve all cringed and borne witness to that infamous (and now deleted) TikTok video of a young woman doing a selfie dance routine in a newborn intensive care unit, next to her very ill infant’s hospital bed. “‘Li’l Lee was taken in cause of low oxygen. He tested positive for RSV. Waiting for him to breathe better on his own,’” read the caption, as she danced to Nessa Barrett’s If You Love Me while miming cradling motions.  For many internet commenters, the video was evidence of a society hell-bent on collapse. “This is the kind of stuff Black Mirror warns us about,” wrote one person on Reddit. Another asked, “Is this real or just some gross ‘social experiment’?” (It’s real.) This is not the first time a video like this has gone viral. In TikTok’s early days, when it was known as Musical.ly, a teen shared a video of himself dancing heart gestures and lip-syncing Justin Bieber while in the background his grandfather lay on his deathbed, while his grandmother wept. How do we explain people doing TikTok dances in the middle of moments of grief, pain and mourning? You might think that Gen Z hasn’t been taught how to properly deal with trauma. But that doesn’t seem right, especially since they admirably are the generation that dismantled the taboo of discussing mental health, some even going as far as self-diagnosing and listing their ailments on social media bios. Thanks to Gen Z, people are finally comfortable with publicly sharing their troubles with peers. Still, there is something remarkable about the degree to which we are beginning to stage public expressions of grief, like this video of a woman bawling over her dead snake. Despite the myriad venomous responses knocking her for positioning a camera specifically to capture and share her bereft wailing, I actually, to my surprise, found the video quite moving. Crying snake woman stirred something in me. I’m unable to watch someone breaking down with a dead animal in their arms without getting teary-eyed myself. I’ve had to say goodbye to beloved pets before, and seeing someone experience relatable heartbreak opens my old wounds right back up. Still, we are not used to public displays of grief – and even less so when they take place to jaunty music on social media. Short of North Korean-style forced public mourning, we’ve been conditioned to wear black, weep and meet a minimum requirement of depression weeks after the death of a loved one. That’s why when we see a video of two sisters processing the death of their mother by singing and dancing Rick and Morty in front of her open casket, or a clip of a woman twerking over the casket of a beloved deceased, some of us react with confusion or even outrage. How dare they express that type of emotion during this dark life event! What we fail to do is acknowledge our morose western predisposition and that many cultures permit dancing around death, like the beloved dancing pallbearers from Ghana. There’s no right way to grieve. And why should grief be private? Teenager Reese Hardy has been anointed the flag bearer for the everyday person’s struggle. Reese cry-dancing to Mariah Carey’s Obsessed over her post-breakup, at-home hair-dye fail has 3.8m views and serves as the official meme of toughing it out in hard times – life-changing or trivial. TikTok’s cringeworthy public displays of emotion could actually be the gift we didn’t know we need: the message that it’s OK to be in our feelings … together. If TikTok is the looking glass into our dystopian future, it’s clear that we can dance through tragedy. Optimism and openness during sadness are precisely the virtues we need to survive this world. We now have permission to put our rawest emotions on display; just because they are set up on a tripod doesn’t mean they are not real and authentic. So, to all the moms and teens in hospitals and funeral homes: keep dancing. Rohit Thawani is a creative director working at the intersection of tech and advertising.

1/7/2022,"“Stop the bombs” reads the angry red writing in the storm cloud thought bubble above the little girl in a pale blue dress. Like all the children in the Japanese artist Yoshitomo Nara’s paintings, she has puppydog eyes and a toddler’s outsized head, yet her posture is pure bruiser. There are tiny animal fangs at the corners of her mouth. Of the paintings, drawings and sculptures in Nara’s latest exhibition, she is the closest to the pint-sized characters with big dark feelings that he began making in the 1990s, some of contemporary art’s most recognisable creations. Those early works, where tots sweetly clutched knives or took fag breaks, blended Japanese kawaii – cuteness – with mischief and menace. Partly thanks to Nara’s alignment with the pop art titan Takashi Murakami’s Superflat movement, he reached a global art audience and a wider public. Both artists mined the Japanese weakness for baby-faced adorableness, an infantilising that Murakami linked to the trauma of Hiroshima. Yet where Murakami’s trademark smiley acid-faced flowers and phallic mushrooms channel the surface sheen of a depthless mass-produced world of cartoons and commerce, Nara’s appeal has always been universal human emotion. “My works’ roots are my childhood, not pop culture,” he explains. “Around me there were orchards, sheep and horses; I read fairytales rather than comics.”  Once described by the artist as self-portraits, his paintings communicate as powerfully as the folk tunes that first inspired him as an isolated child listening to the radio from the US air base in Misawa, or the punk rock he later turned to, creating artwork for cult bands such as Shonen Knife. While Nara’s figures recall saccharine anime, his paintings are expressively hand-wrought, with cardboard or wood planks often used in place of canvas. In recent years, his blackly comic tykes have given way to a more introspective tribe. The latest works include girls with huge eyes flecked in many colours, who stare into the middle distance as if lost in life’s great imponderables, or close their eyes in meditation. Even his guitar- or drumstick-wielding mini rock chicks seem spaced out, depleted of punk’s riotous energy. Nara has created an installation from abandoned building materials in which to show many of his works, like a cross between a clubhouse and a protective retreat. There are a few protesters among the new girls. One wears a “no war” slogan T-shirt, another flips a peace sign, stirring thoughts of Hiroshima and the anti-nuke movements, as well as today’s demonstrations. The turning point for his work’s tonal change, Nara says, was the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami that led to the Fukushima nuclear accident of 2011. “Fifteen thousand people within the 650km from where I live now, north of Tokyo, to my home town, were killed,” he says. “I felt an enormous sense of loss.” The gap between his figures’ pluck and physical powerlessness is striking: little people up against insurmountable forces. They speak to adult angst and the vulnerable child inside us all. Pinacoteca, 2021 (main picture)Taking its title from the classical term for a public art salon, Nara has created an installation from wood and building cast-offs in which his latest works are displayed. “I’ve always felt quite uncomfortable with architecturally solid spaces such as museums,” he says. “To me, places that have a temporary feel such as huts feel more familiar.” No War, 2019Nara’s paintings typically draw on his childhood experiences. “I was nurtured by the civil rights movement’s protest songs and the anti-war movement’s rock songs,” he says. “Also, the Vietnam war didn’t feel like something that happened in a faraway land, as American troops were dispatched from the military bases in Japan.” Stop the Bombs, 2019A number of Nara’s recent paintings reference the 1960s, its protest symbols and hippy culture. Here he was thinking of John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s 1968 “living sculpture” in which two acorns were planted in the east and west gardens of Coventry Cathedral. It was the same year as the adoption of the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Girl With Drum Sticks, 2019Music is key to Nara’s process and, while punk has been a touchstone, in recent years he has turned to the folk songs he heard on US military radio as a child. He explains: “I was influenced a lot by hippy culture with its emphasis on community and nature as in: ‘Back to nature’, and, ‘Living is not breathing but doing’, in the words of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.”Yoshitomo Nara: Pinacoteca, Pace gallery, London, to 15 Jan.",Arts/Art and design,"Yoshitomo Nara: ‘My works’ roots are in fairytales, not comics’",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/07/yoshitomo-nara-my-works-roots-are-in-fairytales-not-comics
1/7/2022,"With her Mickey Mouse backpack, coloured Duplo blocks and disarmingly cute smile, Serena could be any young child constructing a toy house for an imaginary character – were it not for the wires and nodules sticking out of her head. But Serena is a pint-sized pioneer at the cutting edge of research into the enduring mystery of what makes toddlers tick. She is among the first children to be studied at the world’s first dedicated ToddlerLab – a multimillion-pound effort to get inside the heads of toddlers. Young children do and say the most extraordinary things, and in neurological terms, they are extraordinary creatures. “The change in between two and five years of age is pretty spectacular: there’s a lot going on in terms of brain development and cognitive development,” said Dr Natasha Kirkham, a reader in developmental psychology at the Birkbeck Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development (CBCD) in London, home to the Wohl Wolfson ToddlerLab.  Babies’ brains have been extensively studied, by tracking their eye movements, the flow of blood to different brain regions – through a technique called functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) – and the brain’s electrical activity. However, scientific understanding of toddlers has been limited because, until recently, they needed to be tethered to a machine for these tracking and imaging technologies to work. “That was fine for babies, because babies don’t move around much. But as soon as you get to about 18 months and above, children want to move around, and importantly, it’s not part of their natural behaviour to sit still,” said the CBCD’s director, Prof Denis Mareschal. The development of wearable and wireless technologies is now enabling scientists to extend their studies to toddlers. “It means that we can now study young children roaming wild and free, in their natural form, to see what’s happening in the brain while they’re exploring,” Mareschal said. “It also allows us to better understand how they begin to interact with each other socially, and how that impacts on their learning.” Though no longer a toddler, six-year-old Serena Cadete Duarte is part of a cohort of young children who have been followed by Birkbeck researchers since the age of three, to better understand the development of executive function – a set of mental skills that includes planning, working memory, flexible thinking, and self-control. “What’s these?” asks Serena, as research lab developer Dr Paola Pinti hands her a pair of pink fingerless gloves, covered in white reflective bobbles, to wear. The gloves will enable the research team to track Serena’s hand movements via 18 motion-tracking cameras rigged up around the laboratory ceiling, while she plans and builds a house out of Duplo blocks. “Kids are very physical: they gesture a lot, and they point a lot, and sometimes that can give away their thought processes,” says Kirkham. “For example, if you ask a kid to move an item to a certain place, you can see them do it, but what you might catch on a motion capture system is a slight movement to a different thing first – so you can see where they almost made an error.” Now, Pinti slips a fNIRS cap covered in wires and sensors on to Serena’s head, and slides a transceiver into her backpack. This will wirelessly transmit information from the sensors to a computer. “We need to look at your brain while you’re playing with the Duplo blocks,” Pinti says. “OK,” says Serena, sitting down at a table in the lab, which has been kitted out to resemble a preschool classroom. She is shown a short video in which an adult demonstrates how to press a button to release individual Duplo blocks from a set of boxes in front of her, and use them to build a house. When the video stops, Serena is told to copy what she has just observed. The last time Serena executed this task, her performance was very different: three- and four-year-olds are less able to follow complex instructions, their fine motor skills less developed. Now, she deftly builds a sturdy coloured house, with a garden filled with bright plastic flowers. Understanding how such brain processes develop isn’t a purely cerebral exercise: Children with neurodivergent disorders, such as autism, may also have trouble with certain skills such as planning, which Pinti’s study is focused on better understanding. Toddlerhood is also when children start to discover social interactions, gradually progressing from playing alongside one another, to sharing and collaborating during play. Here, too, a better understanding of the subtle ways in neurodivergent children’s brains and behaviours differ during the early years could help potential problems to be identified earlier, when there may be more scope to intervene. Other laboratories include a “home lab”, resembling a front room, and a “nap lab” where researchers can study children’s sleep. However, the jewel in the ToddlerLab’s crown is a virtual environment known as the Cave, which can simulate real-world settings, such as a farm, playground or supermarket, without the need for a bulky VR headset. “If you really want to understand natural behaviours, you have to be in a 3D world, but of course we can’t build environments such as a beach, or a forest, or a zoo, in a laboratory,” Mareschal says. Understanding how children interact with an animal, versus a person, say, could provide new insights into conditions such as autism, where some individuals appear to find it easier to connect with animals compared with their peers. Virtual environments could also help researchers to understand when and how young children begin to distinguish between what’s real and imaginary. Serena is the first child to test the system out. On top of the motion-tracking gloves and fNIRS cap, she is given a pair of large plastic spectacles to wear. These enable her to see in 3D, as well as allowing her eye movements to be tracked – an indication of what is capturing her interest at any given time. “I think I look like a DJ,” Serena says. She is guided into a section of the room, where a playground scene is being projected on to the walls and floor. A small purple elephant is standing on the grass in front of her. Serena is taught how to burst the balloons that rise up from behind his head, by waving her arms to control a small white ball. “I like coming here to play the different games, says Serena,” as she leaps around the room. I wonder what she would like to be when she’s older. “I’d like to be an ocean scientist,” she says.",News/Society,‘We see what’s happening in their brain’: inside the ToddlerLab,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/07/inside-the-toddlerlab-london-research-wearable-tech
1/7/2022,"Ioccasionally get asked why I don’t give more negative reviews – that is, ones that warn readers off the bottles I think are unpalatable or poor value for money. My usual answer is that there’s too much good stuff around (and not a lot of space to write about it), so I’d rather focus on drinks that are worth buying. In the much smaller market of no- and low-alcohol drinks, however, those rules don’t really apply. There’s a lot of innovation and experimentation going on right now and, because a fair number of new producers are jumping on the bandwagon, not all of them have nailed it.  Alcohol-free wine is an obvious case in point. If you enjoy wine, they’re simply not going to cut it for you: I keep trying, and I keep being disappointed. If you’re less picky than I am, however, you might enjoy Oddbird Blanc de Blancs (£9.99 Amazon, 0%), which is at least vaguely vinous, but to be honest I’d rather have a glass of kombucha or sparkling tea, such as the Saicho I mentioned a year ago or the Real Royal Flush in today’s pick. At the other end of the spectrum, there is a great deal of more than decent alcohol-free beer around, my latest find being Butcombe’s, which should appeal to those who find beers described as craft a bit too full on. It’s reasonably priced, which is more than can be said for a lot of the new alcohol-free spirits and aperitifs, some of which taste positively unpleasant on their own. I know that’s not how you should drink them, but if you have to drown something with tonic and garnish it with citrus to make it vaguely palatable, you might as well save yourself a few quid and drink just the tonic. (I exempt my favourites Pentire’s Adrift and Sipsmith’s Freeglider from these strictures, and can recommend the interesting Fluère and Wilfred in today’s panel, although “Would you like a Wilfred?” or “Do you fancy a Fluère?” are not the kind of invitations that trip easily off the tongue.) I also find the ecospeak about some of the latest entrants to the market pretty hard to swallow, among them Ful’s “powered by climate active nutrients” (why would you want a drink that’s Haribo blue, though?) and Bemuse’s “specially selected honey from planet-positive beekeepers” (I guess all beekeepers are planet-positive, so they don’t have to look that hard, but maybe I’m being mean: it’s drinkable at least, so hallelujah for that.) Butcombe Goram IPA Zero £14.45 for 12 x 330ml bottles butcombe.com, 0.5%. Yet another properly good AF ale to add to your arsenal, made in a more classic style than many craft beers. Bemuse Hops Sparkling Low-Alcohol Mead £3.30 for 330ml lowandnodrinks.co.uk, £19.90 for 6 cans bemuseddrinks.com, 0.5%. Pleasant, gently sparkling honey drink. The hops are barely detectable by today’s standards, but offset the sweetness nicely Real Non-Alcoholic Sparkling Kombucha Royal Flush £8 for 750ml Sainsbury’s, £48 for 6 realkombucha.co.uk. Like sparkling tea, a good stand-in for champagne or other bubbly. Delicately fruity. Wilfred’s Bittersweet Orange And Rosemary Aperitif £18 for 50cl The Alcohol-Free Co. If you don’t like cloves, you probably won’t take to this bittersweet aperitif, but I have to say it’s right up my street. Fluère Smoked Agave Non-Alcoholic Spirit £20 Amazon, £24 Harvey Nichols.

1/7/2022,"It is known as Ireland’s “front room”, where esteemed visitors including the Queen, Joe Biden, Emmanuel Macron and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been taken to get a sense of the “land of saints and scholars”. Biden, vice-president at the time, was so moved by the atmospherics in the dimly lit, barrel-vaulted hall when he visited Trinity College Dublin (TCD) in 2016 that he came back a year later to contemplate the history of its old library, known as the Long Room.  But if he were to make a third visit, he may not be so lucky. Three hundred years after the first foundation stone was laid, the 250,000 ancient books and manuscripts – including the ornately decorated ninth-century Book of Kells – printed on vellum, paper or silk are to be moved one by one, along with 500,000 others, to the floor below. It is a monumental task that will take the best part of five years and cost €90m (£75m). “Moving 750,000 vulnerable books is quite an undertaking, so we are having to pilot everything to see what is involved,” says TCD’s librarian and archivist Helen Shenton, who is leading the daunting project involving a 50-strong team. Some of the books in the alcoves that line the 65-metre hall are so delicate they are joined together with fabric ties. The accumulation of exhaust fume particles from the roads surrounding the building can accelerate the deterioration, while human detritus from nearly 1 million annual visitors pre-pandemic, ranging from clothing fibres and human hair, reaches 1cm in parts. Each book has to be examined, dusted, carefully hoovered and repaired if necessary. In a normal maintenance and preservation cycle “it takes us five years alone to clean all the books”, Shenton explains. The restoration project is currently in an “enabling” phase that will last two years because of the fragility of the books. It will determine the logistics of the move and the equal challenge of keeping the collection of books open to students and visiting scholars. The physical preservation of the books is the driving force behind the project. Recent fires at Notre Dame, the national museum in Brazil and the Mackintosh building at the Glasgow School of Art have shown the risks to historic and cultural buildings. “We do not want to join that litany,” says Shenton. “We need to conserve the building and the collection for its fourth century,” she said. Even the distinctive smell that Shenton says many visitors remark on when they enter is evidence of deterioration. According to a book on the library by Harry Cory Wright, the sweet scent is “the smell coming from ageing cellulose in paper, similar to the smell of almonds, which contain the same chemical.” Shenton says: “Books are organic artefacts and what you are smelling is deteriorating leather, deteriorating paper, and the thing we can do to slow that down is to have better environmental conditions. Not only do we need temperature and humidity control, we also need to protect against particle pollution that is coming through the windows.” The restoration has been on the cards for years, and cataloguing each book was finally finished during the pandemic with a team of 50 working from home, completing what was a 40-year project. To future-proof the collection for study, Shenton is also creating the first online catalogue of Trinity’s collection. Each book will be fitted with a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag to enable scholars to be able to target their reads from the comfort of their desks. Once all the books have been removed, the library will close for about three years, during which time the building, under the plans of heneghan peng architects, will undergo a complete makeover. In what will be a shock to many previous visitors, the ground floor will be returned to the open arcade of the original building, which was designed to protect the books on the first floor against damp. At the same time there will be “a completely reimagined exhibition” that will position treasures such as the Book of Kells in an international context, exploring for example “what was happening on the Silk Road at the same time”. And finally, the male-only series of busts, remarked upon by Meghan, that stand at each of the alcoves in the Long Room is also going. It was one of the first things Shenton noticed when she took the job and, after a competition, four new busts by four different artists will be commissioned, of the mathematician Ada Lovelace; the Abbey Theatre co-founder, Lady Gregory; the writer Mary Wollstonecraft; and Rosalind Franklin, the biophysicist who made critical contributions to the identification of the double helix structure of DNA and related RNA.",News/World news,Trinity College Dublin begins €90m project to relocate vulnerable books ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/trinity-college-dublin-begins-90m-project-to-relocate-vulnerable-books
1/7/2022,"Emmanuel Macron has said the EU needs a “frank, exacting” dialogue with Russia to defuse tensions, as he called for new security arrangements on the continent. The French president was rebuffed by other EU states in June when he and the then German chancellor, Angela Merkel, made a surprise proposal for a summit with Vladimir Putin.  Speaking in Paris at the start of France’s six-month EU presidency, Macron said: “I think that the European Union must have a dialogue with Russia. To have a dialogue doesn’t mean to concede – dialogue means above all to take stock of disagreements.” In a nod to last summer’s fierce opposition from Poland and the Baltic states to a summit with Putin, he said talks with Russia had to be coordinated among the EU. Macron said: “I continue to ask for a dialogue that is frank, exacting and coordinated, because member states don’t have the same history with regard to Russia, nor the same geography.” Russia has massed an estimated 100,000 troops along its border with Ukraine, sparking fears of an invasion. Macron was speaking alongside the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, who pledged proposals for a new “architecture of European security”. She rejected claims the EU was a bystander in efforts to resolve the security crisis in Ukraine – the bloc has no formal role in a sequence of meetings next week between the US, Russia and Nato, and under the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. “It’s very clear: no solution without Europe,” Von der Leyen said. Macron welcomed US talks with Russia, praising “exemplary” coordination between Europe and Joe Biden’s White House in this matter, a sign of mended fences since the furious row between Paris and Washington over the Aukus submarine and security pact. The French president said a new security architecture in Europe must take into account the expiry of a cold war-era arms control treaty. The 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, which kept nuclear weapons off European soil for three decades, lapsed in 2019 when the US and Russia failed to agree on its future. “We are no longer covered by the INF treaty, which is a concern to many states, in particular in central and eastern Europe,” Macron said. “We can’t remain in this situation. It’s our responsibility to address it.” Von der Leyen, a German former defence minister, who was Macron’s choice to lead the EU executive, has called for a more “geopolitical” European Commission. She said she was monitoring with great concern the situation in Kazakhstan, where authorities were using lethal force to quash protests. “The rights and security of the citizens are of the utmost importance and must be guaranteed,” she said. “I am launching a call for the end of violence, and the European Union stands ready to offer its assistance where it can.” Earlier in the day, Macron and Von der Leyen visited the Panthéon, the secular mausoleum of prominent French citizens, where they paid tribute to the late Holocaust survivor and celebrated French politician Simone Veil, as well as a founding father of the European project, Jean Monnet. Veil, the first and only female president of the European parliament, was buried in 2017 in the Panthéon, the final resting place of the philosophers Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and – since last November – the French-American civil rights activist Joséphine Baker. Monnet, who died in 1979, proposed in 1950 with the French foreign minister, Robert Schuman, a common market in coal and steel for six European nations – the genesis of the EU. French officials say the EU must become more sovereign in everything from foreign policy, industrial production and management of the pandemic. This means a more assertive stance regarding authoritarian powers such as China and Russia; European production of crucial technologies, such as microchips and medical equipment; as well as exporting vaccines to Africa. Even Europe’s climate agenda for net zero emissions by 2050 is defined as “environmental sovereignty”, as France seeks a speedy agreement on a proposed CO2 levy on polluting imports into the bloc. Member states that seek less economic intervention in the economy, however, are wary of France’s agenda to onshore European production, fearing it could be a form of protectionism against foreign trade. While French and European officials have extolled EU exports and donations of 1.5bn vaccine doses, critics, such as the former UK prime minister Gordon Brown, have accused the bloc of “commandeering” South Africa’s production of Johnson & Johnson shots.",News/World news,"EU must have ‘frank, exacting’ dialogue with Russia, Macron says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/eu-must-have-frank-exacting-dialogue-with-russia-emmanuel-macron-says
1/7/2022,"A Ukrainian opera director arrested in Italy at Russia’s request has pledged to continue his fight against the “oppression” of Vladimir Putin’s government as calls for his release mount from around the world. Yevhen (Eugene) Lavrenchuk, 39, was detained in Naples on an international arrest warrant issued by Russia during a stopover in the city on 17 December.  Russia is seeking his extradition for financial crimes allegedly committed when he was director of the Polish Theatre in Moscow. Lavrenchuk left Russia for Ukraine in 2014 in protest at Russia’s annexation of Crimea that year. Lavrenchuk told the court of appeal in Naples that he was being persecuted by Russia for publicly voicing his dissent. He claimed the persecution led to him being beaten up outside the Odessa opera and ballet theatre, where he was a director, in December 2020. He has refused extradition, saying that he feared being “exposed to discrimination”. Lavrenchuk is being held at Poggioreale prison in Naples, where he was visited this week by Francesco Emilio Borrelli, a regional councillor for the Europa Verde party. “I spoke to him for about 15 minutes during a prison check, which we do periodically,” Borrelli said. “He was calm and in good form; he came across as a person aware of living an injustice and that in the end he will be proven right. He said he’s determined to return to his country to fight against the oppression of Putin’s regime.” Lavrenchuk had never been to Italy before landing at Capodichino airport on 15 December on a stopover in his journey between Tel Aviv, where he had been visiting his sister, and Lviv in Ukraine. He was arrested at a hotel close to the airport after providing his ID at check-in. By law, hotels in Italy have to scan a copy of a guest’s ID document; the details are then sent to the local police for registration. “Police found his name had been inserted into an international search system with a mandate for his arrest,” said Alfonso Tatarano, Lavrenchuk’s lawyer. “He didn’t know he was being looked for by Russian authorities or that his name was in this system.” The case comes as fears mount over the possibility of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Liudmyla Denisova, the Ukrainian parliamentary commissioner for human rights, said on Thursday that Lavrenchuk’s arrest was not made on the basis of a “red notice” by Interpol, as was originally reported, but on a circular note distributed to a limited number of countries. “This testifies to Russia’s abuse of the Interpol charter and its misuse as an instrument of hybrid warfare for the politically motivated persecution of Ukrainians,” Denisova wrote on her Facebook page. The warrant for Lavrenchuk’s arrest was issued by a Moscow court in July 2020. The accusations against him date back eight years, when he allegedly defrauded one of his students by asking for money to pay for repairs to the Polish Theatre. However, it is not yet clear to Italian judicial authorities whether the court had issued a conviction for his alleged crimes or a preliminary injunction. The crime is punishable by 10 years in prison. “We don’t yet have the complete records of the proceedings,” said Tatarano. Russia has 40 days, from the day it was notified of Lavrenchuk’s arrest, to send its formal extradition request and related documents. The case is being handled by Luigi Riello, the chief public prosecutor of the Naples appeals court. “He will evaluate on what basis the request for extradition is being made before submitting his evaluation to the court,” said Tatarano. “If there is concrete danger that Lavrenchuk will receive unfair treatment or that the accusations are based on political opinions, the court will reject the extradition request. But we have to prove this, and I think we can.” Tatarano will appeal for Lavrenchuk to be either released from custody or placed under house arrest pending the outcome of the legal process. A Facebook page calling for Lavrenchuk’s release has attracted more than 1,400 followers while members of the Ukrainian community in Italy are planning to protest in Milan on Saturday. “We are mobilising to show how the Russian regime exploits legal cases against Ukrainian citizens for its own political purposes,” the protest organisers wrote on Facebook. PEN America, the writers’ association, has also called for Lavrenchuk’s immediate release. “The circumstances of Lavrenchuk’s detention – he was detained in Naples while transferring to a flight to Lviv after travelling from Tel Aviv – are a disturbing echo of Belarus’s move last year to force a Ryanair flight to land in order to arrest blogger Raman Protasevich,” said Polina Sadovskaya, PEN America’s Eurasia director. “In this case, Lavrenchuk is one of the most visible voices against the Russian annexation of Crimea in the Eurasian theatre community, and Russia’s extradition request against him bears the hallmarks of politically motivated repression.”",News/World news,Arrested Ukrainian opera director vows to fight Putin ‘oppression’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/arrested-ukrainian-opera-director-vows-to-fight-putin-oppression-yevhen-lavrenchuk-italy
1/7/2022,"There were many excruciating bits in the exposure of Boris Johnson’s affair with cray-cray model-slash-infosec-entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri (who I can’t help but retain a soft spot for, even if she has been fully red-pilled these days. One of the worst, though, was when Arcuri found herself, in the eye of the media storm, being ghosted by Johnson. The one time she successfully got through to him on his mobile to ask him how to handle it, she found herself being mocked by someone “pretending to speak in a Chinese accent”. Or rather, “someone”. I cannot believe that this someone is now involved in further phone-related shithousery – but I guess you never really know anyone. Still, like me, you probably cannot get enough of brilliant prime ministerial investigator Lord Geidt, whose ability to piece together highly complex cases such as “who paid for this £840 roll of wallpaper and why?” marks him out as one of the most fascinatingly unconventional detectives of the era. You’d stop just shy of comparing Geidt with Sherlock Holmes, perhaps – but in the decorative mystery of the Downing Street flat refurbishments, his lordship was certainly Ideal Holmes. Only Ideal Holmes would somehow be able to conclude absolutely nothing from the fact that in the very message in which the prime minister asked for a huge sum of money from a Tory donor, Johnson felt moved to add, apparently ingratiatingly, “PS am on the great exhibition plan Will revert”. Nor from the fact that in the very message in which the Tory donor told the prime minister the money was on the way, he replied – apparently ingratiated – “Thanks for thinking about GE2”.  This reboot of the Great Exhibition seems to have been something of a pet project for Lord Brownlow, who initially met £112,549 of Johnson’s decor bills himself. Less than two months after the above WhatsApp exchange, according to official ministerial records, Brownlow was – according to official ministerial records – meeting the then culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, “to discuss plans for Great Exhibition 2.0”. Just one of those weird instances of Jungian synchronicity that attend this government’s way of doing business, I guess. Something branded Festival UK is now happening instead, and Downing Street yesterday simply refused to say precisely how that event differs from the Great Exhibition 2. Either way, the whole saga is certainly a great exhibition of British establishment accountability. After the Electoral Commission discovered these “accidentally withheld” WhatsApp messages in its own probe into the affair, Lord Geidt was forced to reopen his original investigation, but has now concluded once more that career liar Johnson did not intend to mislead. Or to put it in strictly procedural terms, his lordship has taken a second dive into the barrel of tits, and still come up sucking his thumb. The case has been closed via strongly worded letter – my favourite type of elite justice. I think all punks have to ask themselves: did he fire off six pieces of headed notepaper or only five? Do I feel lucky? Well, DO I? I think most of us would take our chances, let’s face it. Indeed, it’s hard not to laugh at the entire concept of Boris Johnson having a “standards adviser” – it’s like discovering Mark Zuckerberg has a stylist. Or, indeed, a standards adviser. Anyway, now the “Great Exhibition” angle is being queried, you’re probably wondering if the investigation could be reopened by Johnson’s corruption tsar. And you’re probably forgetting that Johnson’s corruption tsar is the guy married to Dido Harding. Take a moment. I needed one too. As for the still-undead Downing Street decoration saga, what’s not to enjoy in these new glimpses of Johnson trying to come off as aesthetically sensitive? In the messages to Brownlow, the prime minister explains that the flat is a “bit of a tip”. Strong words, coming from the lovechild of Uncle Fester and Cousin Itt. Whatever transformation the interior designer Lulu Lytle eventually wrought on the place, I imagine it is by now enhanced by red wine stains and bits of Stilton trodden into the carpet. Takeaway wrappers down the back of the sofa: model’s own. Of course, the real driving force behind the refurb was not Johnson but his wife, Carrie. I know she bangs on about rented dresses and stuff, but her financial positioning is starting to feel a bit “Kate in the streets, Meghan in the 500-thread-count sheets”. John Lewis furniture and fittings would be right at the upper end of what most British people would ever feel able to afford – and yet, I don’t think we’re in John Lewis any more, Toto. Speaking of which, I used to think the only person I wanted to read on the Johnsons’ flat saga was chief justice of interiors, Nicky Haslam. Regrettably, however, Nicky has been bumped down my wishlist by previous No 10 occupant Theresa May, who was famously pictured at home in this very well-appointed dump. “FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, BREAK YOUR SILENCE, MRS MAY” are not words I ever expected to type, but here we all are. I desperately, desperately want to hear a defence of the tip by the no-nonsense tastemaker who created it – ideally at pamphlet length, but would settle for a 3,000-worder. Failing that, can the Great Exhibition/Festival UK include some of these absolute prize human exhibits? We could have a whole pavilion dedicated to Chancers, Chisellers, and Chintz-grifters, and never have to leave a single street in Westminster to fill it.

1/7/2022,"Peter Bogdanovich, who has died aged 82, was among the few examples of a film director whose career rocketed spectacularly at its beginning before it soon plunged to earth. His third feature (after two neophyte efforts), The Last Picture Show (1971), was nominated for eight Academy Awards, and won two. The film that followed, What’s Up, Doc? (1972), was a massive box-office hit, which grossed a healthy $28m for Warner Bros. On a winning streak, Bogdanovich achieved a hat-trick with Paper Moon (1973), which was not only a commercial and critical success, but won a best supporting actress Oscar for Tatum O’Neal who, at 10, was the youngest ever recipient of the award. It seemed that Bogdanovich could do no wrong. But then came Daisy Miller (1974), which received mainly bad reviews, and was followed by further flops and personal upheavals.  He bore it all with equanimity (externally, at least), making cameo appearances in friends’ films and TV shows – nicely dry in the role of Dr Elliot Kupferberg, Tony Soprano’s therapist’s therapist in the hit series The Sopranos (2000-07) – cropping up regularly on documentaries, commenting wittily on film directors and directing films himself from time to time, though he never returned to the glory days. Bogdanovich belonged to the generation of directors who emerged in the 70s, brought up on the movies produced during the golden age of the major studios. In fact, the majority of his films are exercises in style – attempts to recreate the Hollywood past. His two best films were shot in black and white, a practice that had already become rare a decade before. Both The Last Picture Show and Paper Moon lovingly evoke the spirit of John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wellman and William Wyler and, despite their allusiveness, they still appeal to the non-film buff, while What’s Up, Doc?, graced by Ryan O’Neal and Barbra Streisand, is a homage to the screwball comedies of the 30s. (In his documentary Directed By John Ford, 1971, revised in 2006, Bogdanovich disarmingly allowed himself to be put down by the great man.) Bogdanovich was born in Kingston, New York, after his parents fled from Europe and the Nazis, and grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. His mother, Herma (nee Robinson), came from a well-off Austrian Jewish family, and his father, Borislav Bogdanovich, was a Serbian Eastern Orthodox Christian painter and pianist. After graduating from the Collegiate school, he studied acting at the Stella Adler Theatre Studio in the city. Although he both appeared in and directed a number of plays – including The Big Knife, Clifford Odets’s searing drama about Hollywood, in 1959 off-Broadway – Bogdanovich was always drawn to film, and began writing on the subject for various publications. In the early 60s, taking a lead from Henri Langlois’ eclectic programming at the Paris Cinémathèque, Bogdanovich showcased movies at the Museum of Modern Art, introducing audiences to neglected or forgotten American directors such as Allan Dwan, about whom he wrote a book, Allan Dwan: The Last Pioneer (1971). He also wrote books on Ford, Fritz Lang, Alfred Hitchcock and his friend Orson Welles, all of whose voices he could mimic brilliantly. Bogdanovich even had a leading role in Welles’s uncompleted The Other Side of the Wind (shot between 1969 and 1976), as an up-and-coming film director with a talent for mimicry. After a stint as film critic for Esquire magazine, he moved in 1964 to Hollywood where, inspired by French critics such as François Truffaut, he hoped to turn to directing. Initially, he worked as second unit director on Roger Corman’s Wild Angels (1966), before Corman allowed him to direct a Z-movie, Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women (1968), hiding under the name Derek Thomas. Actually, all Bogdanovich had to do was film scenes of Mamie Van Doren and other flimsily clad women on the seashore, and splice the new material together with a dubbed and re-edited Russian sci-fi film called Planeta Burg. Corman then gave the tyro director the money to make the impressive Targets (1968), in which the octogenarian Boris Karloff played Byron Orlok, a horror movie star in danger from a sniper, and confronted by his own image (in Corman’s The Terror) on a screen of a drive-in movie theatre. Targets was good enough for Columbia Pictures to entrust The Last Picture Show to Bogdanovich. This fondly nostalgic look at 50s small-town America cast Ben Johnson (a Ford favourite) as surrogate father to the town’s youngsters, and owner of the movie house forced to close because of the advent of television. The titular movie is Hawks’ Red River. Hawks is also acknowledged in What’s Up, Doc?, with O’Neal and Streisand doing their best to match up to the memories of Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn. For Paper Moon, Bogdanovich went further into the past – the Depression – for a charming yet cynical picaresque tale of a father-daughter con team (O’Neal and daughter Tatum) wheedling money out of widows. Why and how did things go wrong after that? Some commentators have put the decline down to Bogdanovich’s relationships with women. When he was preparing The Last Picture Show, he saw a magazine cover featuring the 19-year-old fashion model Cybill Shepherd, whom he cast as the richest girl in town. It was not long before he divorced his wife, Polly Platt, the production designer on his first films and mother of his two children, whom he had married in 1962, to live with Shepherd. With Shepherd in mind, he directed Daisy Miller, based on the Henry James novel, which came in for a heavy lambasting from the critics. “Trying to make that little thing he’s with into Daisy Miller was hilarious,” the veteran director Henry Hathaway, whom Bogdanovich admired, remarked cruelly. Undeterred, Bogdanovich starred Shepherd opposite Burt Reynolds in At Long Last Love (1975), a flat-footed, off-key musical. It was greeted with even greater scorn than the previous movie. This was followed by a third bomb, Nickelodeon (1976), a slapdash tribute to slapstick silent screen comedy, starring Reynolds with Ryan and Tatum O’Neal. This time Bogdanovich blamed the producers for not allowing him to shoot it in black and white on a more modest budget. After three years spent licking his wounds, Bogdanovich returned, helped by Corman as producer, with Saint Jack (1979), a sincere attempt to get away from Hollywood in two senses. Set in a world of pimps and prostitutes, it has an excellent sense of locale (the red-light district of Singapore). Among a cast headed by Ben Gazzara, the director himself played an American mobster. Although the old-fashioned romantic comedy They All Laughed (1981), flopped initially, it gained a certain cult status for various extra-cinematic reasons: it was the last major role played by Audrey Hepburn, whose son Sean Ferrer is also in the film; Bogdanovich’s two daughters had parts, as did the director’s then girlfriend (the Shepherd liaison was over), the former Playboy model Dorothy Stratten. At the end of filming, Stratten was shot and killed by her husband after he learned of the affair with Bogdanovich. In 1988, Bogdanovich married Stratten’s half-sister, Louise. He regained some credibility with Mask (1985), a film that eschewed the resurrection of moribund genres. Powered by Cher’s strong performance as the drug-taking biker mother of a child with a rare bone disorder, the film gave the director the praise that had eluded him for so long. However, Bogdanovich’s passionate love for Hollywood’s distant past led him to make Illegally Yours (1988), a leaden comedy featuring Rob Lowe (in spectacles, like Grant in Bringing Up Baby). Perhaps still searching for the kind of acclaim he had enjoyed with The Last Picture Show, he went back to the same author (Larry McMurtry) and characters, played by most of the same cast, in Texasville (1990), but the sequel proved lacking in the same appeal and success. His necessarily stagy Americanised film version of Michael Frayn’s frenetic theatre farce, Noises Off (1992), tested Bogdanovich’s skill at orchestrating screwball antics, but it, too, failed to ignite. The Thing Called Love (1993), which followed four young people hoping to make it as country music singers in Nashville, suffered from a detached performance by River Phoenix in his last completed role before his death. For the next few years, Bogdanovich directed several TV movies, and acted in a fair number of them. His return to feature film directing was also a return to Hollywood’s pre-talkie era. The fairly entertaining, well-received The Cat’s Meow (2001) told of the mysterious death of the film mogul Thomas H Ince during a party on William Randolph Hearst’s yacht, with Marion Davies and Charlie Chaplin among the guests. Prior to his final film, a documentary on the silent movie star Buster Keaton, The Great Buster: A Celebration (2018), he made She’s Funny That Way (2014), a likable romantic comedy that proved Bogdanovich was capable of finding a way between outright disasters and masterpieces. He and Louise divorced in 2001. His two daughters, Antonia and Sashy, survive him.
