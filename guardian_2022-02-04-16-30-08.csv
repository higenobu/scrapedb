2/4/2022,"Germany’s new chancellor Olaf Scholz is waving goodbye to the honeymoon period of his tenure, as his “inaudible” stance over the brewing crisis on the Ukrainian border is failing to impress not just Russia-hawks abroad but also more ambivalent voters at home. Scholz, whose liberal-left “traffic light” coalition was sworn in less than two months ago, has been criticised by Kyiv and other east-central European capitals for sticking to his country’s restrictive stance on weapons export to crisis regions and looking slow to spell out the potential sanctions that could be triggered by a Russian invasion into Ukraine.  This week, Scholz has also had to face similar criticism in Berlin, however. “How does it feel when allies are classifying Germany’s attitude as unreliable?”, the Social Democrat politician was asked in an interview on German television on Wednesday night. When Scholz denied this was the case, the host interrupted him, pointing out that even his ambassador in Washington had warned in a leaked memo that “Germany, we have a problem”. While Angela Merkel rarely excelled as an orator or rhetorician, Scholz “seems to want to surpass her in the art of disappearance”, wrote weekly Der Spiegel, describing her successor’s performance over the last few weeks as “almost invisible, inaudible”. A survey by pollster Infratest Dimap published on Thursday saw support for Scholz’s SPD drop to 22%, overtaken by the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on 27%. His personal approval rating dropped by 17 percentage points in the same poll. One factor that has undermined the chancellor’s authority in particular is the behaviour of his last centre-left predecessor in the chancellory – and former boss – Gerhard Schröder, who continues to comment on global affairs in his role as chair of Russian energy companies Nord Stream and Rosneft. In his television interview, Scholz was urged to clarify that he was not taking the ex-chancellor turned lobbyist’s advice. “If I understand the constitution of the federal German republic correctly, there is only one chancellor and that is me,” Scholz said with characteristic understatement. Yet another factor that may explain the German leader’s paralysis is that he is catering towards often contradictory views on Russia held by the German public. The US is traditionally identified by Germans as their most important partner – a November 2021 survey by the Körber Foundation found a resurgent faith in transatlantic relations after the election of US president Joe Biden. Less than 5% of those surveyed believed Russia to be an important partner. But as a whole the German public does not perceive Vladimir Putin’s Russia to be a direct threat either. The same poll, carried out before the buildup of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border last December, has only 16% of Germans surveyed identifying Russia as a threat to German values. More than 80% said the country was a minor threat or no threat at all. On the conflict on the Ukrainian border, German doveishness is not merely a party-political compromise: Infratest Dimap’s poll of the public saw a clear majority in favour of granting Russian security assurances from Nato and even a slim majority against economic sanctions. Restricting arms exports into crisis regions on principle is not only backed by every party in the Bundestag – from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland to leftwing Die Linke – but also a 71% majority of the electorate. Such tendencies are even more pronounced among older generations and those living in the eastern regions of the country. A survey by pollster Forsa published this week found 43% of those living in the former states of socialist East Germany hold the US responsible for intensifying the conflict in eastern Ukraine, while only 32% blamed Russia. In western Germany, 52% held Russia responsible, and only 17% said the problem lay with the US. Holding such differing views in balance is a particular problem for Scholz and his party: the SPD currently governs in all five states of the former east, whose premiers wield influence via the Bundesrat, the upper house of the German parliament. One of these states, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where the SPD scored a clean sweep of direct mandates at last year’s election, is also where the Nord Stream 2 pipeline arrives from Russia. The completed-but-unapproved infrastructure project, criticised by most of Europe for making Germany reliant on Russian gas, is highly popular among the local population and supported by Social Democrat politicians in the region. Scholz’s disappearing act is not going to satisfy these voters, however, said Liana Fix, a Russia expert for the Körber Foundation and resident fellow at the German Marshall Fund. “Again and again, what we found when we surveyed the German public on attitudes to Russia is that independence matters: people don’t like the feeling they’re being talked into something,” Fix told the Guardian. “German voters may not want their country to supply weapons, but they want their leader to be visible in the diplomatic effort. And that is something that should be within Scholz’s reach.”",News/World news,‘Almost invisible’: Germans lose patience with Olaf Scholz as he hesitates on Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/almost-invisible-germans-lose-patience-with-olaf-scholz-as-he-hesitates-on-ukraine
2/4/2022,"The Northern Territory court of appeal has upheld a ruling that state-owned housing must be reasonably comfortable to be considered habitable, in a decision that advocates say should result in better housing outcomes for remote communities across the territory. Friday’s decision follows a six-year legal battle brought by residents of the Ltyentye Apurte or Santa Teresa community 85km south-east of Alice Springs. The community said inadequate and inhumane housing was due to repeated failures by public housing authorities to conduct necessary repairs.  Seventy residents took the territory government to the Northern Territory civil and appeals tribunal over the state of housing in the Eastern Arrernte community in 2016. One of the claimants lived with a blocked toilet and a leaking shower for 269 days and many homes had missing doors, faulty stoves and leaking air conditioners. One resident, Enid Young, went without an air conditioner for 540 days. The tribunal found in favour of the residents in 2019 and agreed the government, as landlord, had an obligation to provide habitable housing, but said that under the NT Residential Tenancies Act a house just had to meet standards of health and safety to be considered “habitable”. The tribunal said it applied a “very high test” for finding a premise uninhabitable, and that to be uninhabitable the state of the premises must have been such that there was a “threat to the tenant’s safety, going to both structural and health issues”. Two community members, Enid Young and Mr Conway, whose first name is not used as he has since passed away, then challenged that decision in the supreme court, arguing that they were owned further compensation due to the condition of their homes, which in Young’s case included going without a back door for six weeks. They also argued that the definition of habitability should be expanded, resulting in the supreme court ruling that the question of habitability should include an “overall assessment of humaneness, suitability and reasonable comfort of the premises … judged against contemporary standards”. In February 2021, the housing authority appealed the supreme court decision, arguing that the definition of habitability adopted by the court was too broad. It also disputed a ruling that the case be remitted to the civil and appeals tribunal to determine compensation. On Friday, the full bench of the NT court of appeal upheld the government’s appeal on two grounds, challenging the tribunal’s ability to determine compensation for an invalid rental agreement and a failure to replace Young’s door in a timely manner, but dismissed an attempt by the government to narrow the definition of habitability. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The court also heard evidence presented by the Australian Human Rights Commission which intervened in the case as amicus curiae. In a written judgment, the court said that while the criteria for assessing habitability of housing adopted in the supreme court decision – that housing be both humane and suitable – was “insufficiently precise”, the requirement that a house must be reasonably comfortable should stay. It found there were provisions in the act “which indicate a legislative intention that the considerations which inform the determination of habitability are not coextensive with matters of health and safety”, and said that “an accumulation of defects in the property may so undermine its comfort and amenity as to render it unfit for habitation, even where those defects do not constitute a threat to health and safety”.

2/4/2022,"As many Texans endure another harsh cold snap this week when a winter storm hits the state, some 50,000 people have been hit by power outages in a grim reminder of last year’s big freeze in the state.  While this week’s experience likely will not rival the 2021 winter storm that ​left much of Texas in darkness and was responsible for several hundred deaths, it is a test for the state’s capacity to handle the challenges of more severe weather as a result of the ongoing global climate crisis. Governor Greg Abbott has already caught flak for backtracking on the promise he made just two months ago that power outages would not occur this winter. This week, as power began to fail in some Texan homes, it prompted condemnation from prominent local politicians that not enough has been done over the last year to protect Texans’ access to power. Former presidential candidate Julian Castro told the Guardian: “Greg Abbott and Texas Republicans sold our state’s power grid to the highest bidder, and as a result, five million families lost power and hundreds lost their lives. Rather than working to fix the grid, they let energy lobbyists write their own laws and collected millions in political donations in return. We need new leadership that will work to modernize our grid and prioritize sustainability, not more corrupt politicians who line their pockets with money from special interests.” Texas is working around the clock to respond to the winter storm expected to impact our state over the next few days.State agencies are working together to provide resources & information to keep Texans safe. In a statement to the Guardian, The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the state’s electrical grid said it is taking early action to try and head off any outages: “ERCOT will deploy all the tools available to us to manage the grid effectively during this winter weather.” But such statements might not alleviate all fears in a state where the impact of winter storm Uri – which saw at least 246 deaths – is still keenly remembered. At that time, the grid that powered nearly the entire state began to fail, forcing energy regulators to roll out blackouts in order to avoid a complete shutdown. In the end some 4 million households were left without power in freezing temperatures for days. Here is a look at the problems, how they have been tackled and what needs to still happen: As far as seeing a repeat on the scale of last year’s disaster, experts predict Texas is better prepared for now as some upgrades to the infrastructure powering the state have either been made or are underway. But there is also still much to be done, according to Kenneth Medlock, an energy economist and fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy. He called the state’s capacity to handle last year’s winter storm “a failure on all fronts”. “[The power supply chain] actually got cut off during the winter storm last year which contributed to the downward spiral in the state. You had capacity outages experienced by virtually every form of generation,” said Medlock. In addition to being structurally unprepared for the extremely cold weather, the lack of communication between the the Public Utility Commission (PUC) and the Texas railroad commission, the state agencies overseeing power and oil and gas, respectively, proved to be both inefficient and dangerous. Hospitals, for example, never had their power cut because they were automatically deemed ‘critical infrastructure,’ but other entities in dire need of constant power, like waste management and water treatment plants, needed to apply for the designation. The power blackouts at water treatment facilities forced nearly every major city in the state to issue a “boil water” notice before consumption. In order to be designated as critical infrastructure, power suppliers needed to fill out a form found on ERCOT’s website. However, the form was not publicized and therefore not completed, meaning those who most needed power, went without when forced outages began to roll out. “It’s literally a two-page form. As long as you fill it out, being deemed critical means electricity can be directed to a specific consumer,” said Medlock. “The biggest failure that we saw last year was bureaucratic.” As a result of this bureaucratic failure, the PUC also unintentionally turned off the lights at natural gas facilities, which delivers power to much of the state. As of today, most gas supply infrastructure in the state has been designated as critical, which prioritizes their power supply in the event power outages ever need to be rolled out again. “This by itself adds a lot of capacity back into the mix that we didn’t have last winter. Even if there’s no additional winterization requirements fulfilled, that’s going to bring anywhere from 7 or 9 gigawatts of capacity back to the grid,” said Medlock. In June 2021, the summer following the winter storm, the state passed Senate Bill 3, a new law “relating to preparing for, preventing, and responding to weather emergencies, power outages, and other disasters …” One provision of the new law mandates the creation of an emergency alert system that will notify residents of upcoming power outages via text rather than cutting off power without notice and literally leaving millions of Texans in the dark. More importantly, the law now requires power plants to ‘weatherize’ or update their equipment to withstand extreme weather to prevent outages in the first place. However, these weatherization regulations do not apply to oil and gas production and distribution facilities like wellheads and pipelines, which serve as the fuel supply chain to the power plants. “[The legislation] didn’t go far enough,” said Cyrus Reed, the conservation director of the Lone Star chapter of the Sierra Club, a US based environmental organization. “The gas supply has not been required to winterize yet. Even in these recent freezes [in January 2022], we’ve had some problems. We did have some power plants in the Permian Basin that couldn’t operate because they couldn’t get the gas supply, so it did impact power production.” Unlike some other states that have designated utility providers, the energy market in Texas is open. This means customers can select any electricity provider within their supply area. Most electricity providers offer fixed-rate contracts for a limited period of time. If the contract expires, customers are charged a variable rate at their provider’s discretion. In February 2021, that rate was astronomical because demand was so high and the providers from which Texas companies bought power could charge whatever they wanted, engaging in price gouging practices that left some Texans whose power stayed on with electricity bills for thousands of dollars for the week of the winter storm. Now, regulators have made it so wholesale electricity customers will not have bills quite so high, but they stopped short of regulating electricity prices. Still, energy customers – nearly every Texas resident and business – will see their bill increase significantly with energy providers citing the necessary infrastructure updates as the culprit for the higher prices. In San Antonio, the city’s public energy provider, CPS Energy, increased their base rate by 3.85%, saying “the pass-through fee will help CPS Energy recover $418m it has already paid in fuel costs from the winter storm in February 2021”. Customers of private energy providers like CenterPoint, NRG, or TXU, for example, could see even higher bill increases. Plans to use state funds to subsidize necessary and expensive upgrades to power plants did not advance. Instead, customers are left footing the bill. “It’s corporate welfare, basically,” Reed said. Reed believes the state could do more to protect customers, or rather average Texans, by also addressing the high demand due to energy inefficient building codes. “We didn’t have enough [power] supply, but you could look at it the other way. The other thing you could say is that we had too much demand,” Reed said. “Either the gas didn’t get to the power plants or the wind turbines froze. We have all these old buildings and old homes, some of which are using resistance strip heating (electric heaters) … Unlike other states, we as a state haven’t put a lot of investment and goals and programs into energy efficiency and demand response.” Could Texas see another winter storm of that scale? According to Texas state climatologist, John Nielsen-Gammon, another severe “Arctic blast” hitting the state, like the one seen in 2021, is not so likely, though not impossible. “[A big freeze is] less likely for two reasons: Arctic temperatures are warming faster than the rest of the planet. As the weather patterns that lead to cold air become more common, the cold air itself will be milder.” Nielsen-Gammon said because of global heating and the increase in temperature across the Arctic, the frequency of severe weather events is likely to increase but temperatures will not be as extreme. “Regarding the snow, that’s less likely to occur in the future. Also because we’re far enough south, the main determining factor is not whether we get a storm. It’s whether it’s going to be cold enough to snow.”",News/US news,"As Texas faces another winter storm, can it prevent a ‘failure on all fronts’?",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/03/texas-snow-storm-climate-crisis-greg-abbott

We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. Coxwold is an endearing, honey-hued village in the Hambleton district of North Yorkshire. Part of the Howardian Hills and within the North York Moors national park, this bonny spot was once heralded as one of the best places to live in the UK. In the village itself, there is a row of stone cottages, a church, a pub, a few tearooms, even a cabinet maker, and at the top of the village sits Shandy Hall, the former home of 18th-century novelist Laurence Sterne. The village was given to the Fauconberg family by Henry VIII, but records suggest its history started long before this: the oldest spelling of the village name is Cuhu-walda, Cuhu being a personal title and walda being a wood. In Domesday Book, Coxwold is cited by its Saxon name – Cucvalt – which means Cuckoo Wood. The White Horse of Kilburn is within walking distance of the village and the spectacular scenes as you reach it are an absolute highlight. At the very top, there is a Constable-like patchwork of dales that is utterly spirit-reviving. It’s easy to see why James Herriot once declared these dashing views over the Vale of York as the “finest in England”. Etched into the hillside, the horse is 95 metres long by 67 metres tall – and is the biggest and most northerly hill figure in England; it is said to be visible from Leeds, 28 miles away. The main access is from a car park below, but the more adventurous can extend the walk along the bilberry-lined pathway, where it can be appreciated from every angle. There’s something different to see during every season, and at every time of day: the ever-changing landscape with its kaleidoscope of green and transient shadow and light always makes my heart flutter a little. The horse itself was the brainchild of Victorian businessman Thomas Taylor, and completed in 1857. He had taken inspiration from the Uffington White Horse in Oxfordshire, and designed an even bigger figure in his hometown, but he faced a problem: the local geology was of sandstone, not chalk, so to make his horse stand out, it was covered with light-grey limestone pebbles and painted white. The village’s 17th-century Fauconberg pub is the ideal starting and finishing point for a beautiful stroll. We turn right as we leave the pub and walk uphill, past Saint Michael’s church on the left. We enter the signposted gate on the right-hand side of the road and walk across a field still blanketed in amber leaves and mellow golden light. As we head towards Kilburn, the feeling of sheer space, surrounding quietude and the restorative nature of birdsong envelops me. After crossing a field of refreshing green, we come out of the opposite gate and turn right onto a rustic country track. I glimpse a bouquet of pheasants darting across the laneway, and the seasonal spectrum ahead of me is an impressive show: all the earthy shades with a splash of bright yellow for good measure. The saffron filter flickering over grass is glorious. We pass Fox Folly farm and walk through the wooded valley until we get to a public footpath sign on the right. We join the path, taking a sharp left up the hill to the lovely hamlet of High Kilburn, part of Kilburn village – just a smattering of houses around a delightful green. From there, we trek on to the heart of Kilburn itself, an utterly idyllic Yorkshire spot. We pass the Mouseman furniture shop – established by Robert “Mousey” Thompson in the early 20th century and where local craftspeople still produce hand-carved wooden treasures – and head up the lanes to see a spectacular, beautifully lit view of the white horse. Next we head into woods on the track to the base of the horse and enjoy some forest bathing. The peace and stillness of the woods is a lesson in the ancient Japanese art of shinrin-yoku or nature therapy. Arriving at the car park, we brace ourselves before the short but steep climb to the top of the horse. It doesn’t take long but it’s not for those with vertigo – as my companion realises halfway up. I find myself stopping frequently to view the country spread out below from different elevations: every stop offers unique, breathtaking views, like wondrous chapters in a book. We return along the same route for pampering and refreshments at the pub – but mainly to thaw out by the fire. The Fauconberg is a homely coaching inn and the hosts, mother and daughter Annelies and Claudia, have restored its original features and character. There has been an inn on the site since the 17th century and it is a warm and inviting place after a blustery winter walk: there’s a cosy lounge with a log burner that adds some hygge joy and the sense of history and antiquity is evident as soon as you step through the door to a warm Yorkshire welcome. In the snug bar area, there are ales from Yorkshire brewery Isaac Poad and Masham-based Theakston on tap. There are flagstone floors, original beams and wood panelling, Mouseman furnishings and roomy fireside tables. There’s also a more formal dining room. While the pub is known for its hearty breakfasts, for later in the day, the menu includes favourites such as the Fauconberg steak and ale pie (£14.95) and beer-battered fish and chips (£14.95), with some produce sourced from local butchers and fishmongers. There are also vegetarian and vegan options. For a quick walkers’ lunch, the house sandwiches (with salad and chips, £7) hit the spot. Of the pub’s nine luxurious and classically styled rooms, my favourite is the Belasyse, with its four-poster bed and rich tones of bronze, yellow and chocolate brown – a decadent stay for a night.

Until her arrest in 2017, Anna Sorokin (AKA Delvey) posed as a wealthy German heiress in order to infiltrate and defraud New York high society. This new serial drama from Shonda Rhimes tells her startling story – through the eyes of Vivian Kent (Anna Chlumsky), a journalist struggling to write a feature about her. Julia Garner plays Sorokin as an odd, unsettling enigma – pivoting unpredictably between brittle vulnerability and extreme arrogance; defying any attempts to categorise or explain her.

2/4/2022,"The Covid-19 pandemic has seen two pernicious trends emerge as to how Americans are getting around their country: public transit is struggling with a reduced number of paying customers, while there has been a sharp increase in car crash deaths.  The shuttering of businesses, the rise of working from home and a fear of contracting the coronavirus saw public transport use plummet across the US – commuter rail alone reported a 79% decline in ridership in the year to September 2020. Despite a slight resurgence in 2021, trips taken on all modes of public transit are still around half of what they were before the pandemic, federal government figures show. Meanwhile, transport officials have also been alarmed by a surging number of car-related deaths. The first half of 2021 saw more than 20,000 people die in car crashes, according to federal government data, up 18% on the previous year and the highest since 2006. Pete Buttigieg, the US transportation secretary, called the death toll, which is claiming the lives of about 3,000 people a month, “a national crisis” as he unveiled a new road safety strategy last week. Transport experts say that these trends, while complex and not necessarily linked, are slowing progress on road safety while also hampering efforts to improve the livability of cities and to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the US transportation system, which is the country’s largest contributor to dangerous climate change. “I think, long-term, if we don’t see major changes in transit ridership and road and land uses, we will have huge problems,” said Tara Goddard, an expert in transportation safety at Texas A&M University. “We will see emissions as horrible as they are now, road safety numbers as bad as now, inequities and social problems as bad as they are now. If we aren’t committed to serious change, we will have a lot of problems.” The reasons behind the increase in traffic fatalities aren’t fully understood but a prevailing theory is that people have been speeding more, and therefore involved in worse crashes, due to roads that were cleared of the congestion when the pandemic hit and people stayed at home more. “The roadway system in the US is built for speed, so when the traffic disappeared when Covid hit, traffic fatalities went off the chart,” said Benito Perez, policy director at Transportation for America. “People are also spreading out their trips during the day and more people are walking and biking on roads designed for cars. So you’re getting this constant conflict. It’s a recipe for fatal crashes.” There has also been an “alarming” increase in people dying after being ejected from their cars during crashes because they weren’t wearing seatbelts, Goddard said, along with a rise in crashes because of drug and alcohol use by drivers. This is building upon trends seen since before the pandemic, such as the soaring popularity of hulking SUVs that are far more likely to kill pedestrians when they hit them. “We have big, wide roads, very poor pedestrian crossings, a lack of lighting and we are buying bigger cars,” said Goddard. “It also seems there is more aggressive, distracted driving now. There is a lot going on in society that Covid has brought to a head.” The increasing death toll on the roads has played out while public transit, long underfunded and politically overlooked in the US, has suffered from a steep drop in users that only partially rebounded as pandemic restrictions eased last year. Many bus and train routes across the US have been curtailed, with the recent surge in infections from the Omicron variant stripping the system of a large number of sick drivers and other transit staff. Six subway lines in New York City were suspended during December and January due to a lack of available staff. The slump in fare revenue has imperiled some public transit lines. “Unfortunately public transit has to justify its existence by showing a profit margin, whereas no such questions are asked of highway funding,” said Perez. Although low-paid yet essential workers continued to use public transit during the pandemic through necessity, many people who could afford to work from home or take other modes of transport have stayed away from trains and subways. “Transit is so poorly resourced in the US that it makes it very fragile to disruption,” said Goddard. “If it already doesn’t work well for people, it doesn’t take much to push them off it.” Goddard said there was a “glimmer of hope” in the Biden administration allocating $109bn in grant funds for public transit projects from the bipartisan infrastructure bill – which is the largest single investment in public transport in US history – but that the administration’s greater focus on electric vehicles won’t solve the deep-rooted problems in how America’s towns and cities are structured. “We need to focus on land use solutions so people don’t have to travel as much because things are closer to them, where driving isn’t the only option,” she said. “EVs certainly have a role to play but if you get hit at 45mph it doesn’t matter if it’s an EV or gas-powered car. We shouldn’t just replicate our existing problems but with new technology.”",News/World news,Covid-era Americans are using public transit less and having more car crashes ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/public-transit-car-crash-deaths-us
2/4/2022,"Dr Brian Resler, an emergency physician in the San Francisco Bay Area, recently polled a group of doctors on an overnight shift about their jobs. “Everyone of us said if we could go back, we would choose a different career,” said Resler, who spoke on the condition that the Guardian does not identify his hospital.  Resler and his fellow doctors feel that way although California has recently seen a sharp decrease in the number of Covid-19 cases after the spike due to the highly contagious Omicron variant. That slump in cases has largely been mirrored across the US as the Omicron wave has peaked and many parts of the US are firmly on its downslope. But, while some health experts have predicted that the worst of the pandemic is behind us, the ripple effects of the virus, such as its impact on patients needing care for other issues, continue to test the limits of the US healthcare system and its providers. “Most people got into healthcare because they wanted to help people and make a difference, and I think at this point, it’s just broken beyond repair,” said Resler, 36, who has worked in emergency medicine for seven years. Across the country, the daily average of Covid-19 cases and daily average of hospitalizations due to the virus has decreased by 49% and 16% respectively over the past two weeks, according to the New York Times data. Despite those positive trends, 80% of US hospitals in the last week of January were under “high or extreme stress”, meaning that more than 10% of their hospitalizations were due to Covid-19, according to data compiled by National Public Radio using a framework from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. California was the tenth worst in the country with 69% of hospitals were under extreme stress, meaning that more than 20% of those facilities’ hospitalizations were due to Covid-19. “Even though the odds of getting very sick with Omicron and the odds of getting sick once you are vaccinated and boosted are lower, the sheer number of infections means that there are still going to be a lot of sick people,” said Resler, who explained that most of the Covid-19 patients who were hospitalized were unvaccinated. Also, because of the threat of the virus, many people earlier in the pandemic were afraid or unable to seek care for their health issues. Now that delay is catching up with patients, Resler said. “That leads to a lot of overwhelming of the system and a lot of angry patients. A lot of patients hear that things are overwhelmed, but when faced with long wait times and an overwhelmed emergency department, it’s a lot different to see it for yourself when you are sick and seeking care than hearing about it,” he said. In Missouri, the second worst state in the country for hospitalizations, 79% of the hospitals are under extreme stress. At Mercy hospital in Springfield, in the south-western part of the state, about 28% of their hospitalizations are Covid-19 patients, according to Erik Frederick, the hospital’s chief administrative office. Even if patients were admitted for other reasons but happened to test positive for Covid-19, “those patients require the same amount of resources, as far as isolation and all the personal protective equipment and human resources,” said Frederick. The virulence of the Omicron variant means that the hospitals also have a significant number of staff who test positive for the virus and must then quarantine. This creates an increased patient load for the providers that are left, and hospitals must offer incentives to encourage staff to pick up additional shifts and hire nurses from outside agencies, Frederick said. “It creates a lot of stress on the healthcare system,” Frederick said. Children’s hospitals have also not been immune from the strain caused by the Omicron variant. Over two weeks in January, there was a 20% increase in the cumulative number of child Covid-19 cases, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Every few hours at University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, the house supervisor, who coordinates care for patients, sends out alerts about the numbers of available beds in particular units. “When those numbers get small, it means that we have to make some hard decisions,” said Dr Rachel Pearson, assistant professor of pediatrics and the medical humanities at UT Health San Antonio. “Sometimes that means kids who I would prefer to be upstairs with my hospital pediatrics team are stranded in the [emergency department].” Sometimes the hospital has to stop accepting transfer patients from smaller hospitals or clinics or had to have those patients wait in the emergency department. “We are stretched. It seems like we have been able to find creative solutions to safely care for kids for the most part, but I really feel for those rural doctors out there because I know sometimes they are on the phone and making call, after call, after call, trying to find a hospital with a higher level of care that can accept their sick patient,” said Pearson. Still, Pearson is encouraged that the Food and Drug Administration could soon authorize the Pfizer vaccine against Covid-19 for children under five. And Frederick, who also sees patients from rural areas with low vaccination rates, said he is optimistic about the future of the pandemic. “I’m optimistic about the numbers, but most of my optimism comes from my team and how they have responded and continue to respond,” he said. Resler isn’t so optmistic. His early interest in emergency medicine came from the rewarding nature of providing care to patients, some of whom don’t initially have a heartbeat. Now he and colleagues talk about the “thank you” to “[expletive] you,” ratio, and the former is consistently outweighed by the latter, he said. “I spend most of my day apologizing and being yelled at,” said Resler. “We had similar issues years ago, but it’s just gotten much worse, to the point where anytime I go see a new patient, it’s a pleasant surprise when they are not angry at me.”",News/Society,"As Omicron peaks, the US healthcare system is left ‘broken beyond repair’",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/03/us-coronavirus-healthcare-system-providers
2/4/2022,"Tucker Carlson has been accused of promoting “antisemitic tropes” in his documentary Hungary vs Soros: The Fight for Civilization, which attacks the billionaire Democratic donor – and frequent target of antisemitic hate – George Soros. The film, which aired last week, sees Carlson, a Fox News host with a long history of inflammatory rightwing rhetoric, travel to Hungary, where he tees up a selection of politicians and commenters to attack Soros, a wealthy philanthropist who has donated billions of dollars to Democratic causes.  Soros, who is Jewish and was born in Hungary, has been subjected to antisemitic attacks from conservatives for decades. Far-right activists and believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory have accused Soros of funding violent protests, of supporting an imagined global ring of pedophiles and of driving illegal immigration, a recurring theme in Carlson’s film. Carlson claims in the documentary that Soros has “spent decades” waging “a kind of war, political, social and demographic war on the west”. Carlson’s narration is accompanied by black and white images and screeching, dystopian music. “Unlike the threats from the Soviets and the Ottoman empire, the threat posed by George Soros and his nonprofit organizations is much more subtle and hard to detect,” Carlson says. Later, he claims that Soros has plotted to “oust democratically elected leaders” and “install ideologically aligned puppets”, nodding to antisemitic tropes about a global cabal which controls the world’s politics and finances. Soros has given at least $18bn to his Open Society Foundations organization, which offers financial grants to groups around the world, and has been a key donor to Democratic politicians and causes. He has long been a target of the political right, which has projected an array of conspiracy theories about the billionaire. In 2018 a pipe bomb was delivered to Soros’s home in Bedford, about 40 miles north of New York City. “This so-called documentary, reviewed by Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, is nothing more than far-right propaganda at best, and at worst a dangerous antisemitic dog-whistle sure to be heard loud and clear by a large audience,” Jake Hyman, a spokesman for the ADL, said. “Throughout the program, Carlson promotes antisemitic tropes that Soros controls world events and influences the global media, that Soros and the NGOs he funds are responsible for changing demographics in Europe, bringing in non-white immigrants and subsequently with that crime and violence to Europe.” Hyman added: “It’s totally fair to criticize Mr Soros’ support of partisan policies or candidates, but casting a Jewish individual as some sort of puppet master who manipulates national and international events for malign purposes has the effect of mainstreaming antisemitic tropes and giving support to bona fide antisemites and extremists who disseminate these ideas knowingly and with malice.” In the film, Carlson explains Hungary to his audience in easily understandable terms. It’s in Europe, he says, and is “about the size of Indiana, about the population of Michigan”. Carlson adds: “Like the midwest, it’s pretty flat here.” Hungary, Carlson goes on to claim, is “an outpost of western civilization in the middle of Europe”. But for all Carlson’s fawning over the country’s direction under Viktor Orbán, its authoritarian prime minister, Hungary has lurched into political territory that demonizes immigrants, LGBTQ individuals and other groups. In 2018 Orbán, who came to power in 2010 and was interviewed by Carlson in Hungary last year, described refugees as “Muslim invaders”, and also said: “We must defend Hungary as it is now. We must state that we do not want to be diverse ... We do not want our own color, traditions and national culture to be mixed with those of others.” Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, previously wrote an open letter to Lachlan Murdoch, executive chairman and CEO of Fox Corporation, which owns Fox News, after Carlson’s previous documentary Patriot Purge aired on Fox Nation in October 2021. That film sought to sanitize the January 6 insurrection, airing conspiracy theories and attempting to absolve Donald Trump’s supporters of blame. Two Fox News contributors quit the network in protest against the film. After Soros vs Hungary aired, Greenblatt tweeted: “On the eve of #HolocaustRemembranceDay, it’s appalling to see Tucker Carlson & FOX invoke the kind of antisemitic tropes typically found in white supremacist media. There’s no excuse for this kind of fear mongering, especially in light of intensifying #antisemitism.” The documentary aired on Fox Nation, Fox News’s sister channel, which is a streaming-only service. But Fox News promoted it, too, in a tweet, while the documentary was given an uncritical write-up on the Fox News website, complete with an embedded video of a trailer for the film. A Fox News spokesperson pointed to remarks Carlson made in previewing the film, in which the host said, “Orban may be the only world leader who stood up to Soros directly”. “And so we thought that was interesting enough, enough of a metaphor for the struggle that is going on globally between nationalists and people who oppose them. We thought it was worthy of our season finale documentary for our series Tucker Carlson Originals,” Carlson said. The film does not address the decades-long antisemitic attacks on Soros, although at one point in the documentary Carlson claims that the media is quick to “claim any attack on George Soros is antisemitic”. In a statement to the Washington Post, Laura Silber, the vice-president of Open Society, said Soros and the group “have worked for more than 30 years to support vibrant and inclusive democracies whose governments are accountable to the people they serve”. “Mr Carlson appears to prefer authoritarian rule, state capture of media and the courts, crony corruption and rigged elections,” Silber said. Some prominent Fox News hosts, including Carlson, have a history of making comments or advancing arguments that have been deemed antisemitic or xenophobic. In September Carlson was criticized for promulgating the “great replacement” theory about immigration. Carlson denied that he was being antisemitic. As recently as 27 January, Holocaust Remembrance Day, Laura Ingraham displayed a mocked-up image of Soros clutching bank notes on her show, as she claimed Democrats were using “dark money” to control the Supreme Court. In December 2021 Fox News removed a cartoon from its Facebook and Instagram which showed Soros as a puppet master manipulating a Democratic district attorney and Democratic attorney general.",News/Media,Tucker Carlson film on George Soros is his latest antisemitic dog-whistle,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/03/tucker-carlson-film-antisemitic-attack-against-george-soros
2/4/2022,"Austria has become the first country in the EU to make vaccinations against Covid-19 mandatory for all adults, but questions remain over whether it can sway those sceptical of taking the jab and how much the Alpine state’s government is willing to press those who won’t comply. The upper house of the Austrian parliament, the Bundesrat, on Thursday evening voted 47-12 in favour of a general vaccination mandate, formally approving a law that will see those over the age of 18 who decline to take a jab face penalties of up to 3,600 euros, unless they are pregnant or severely ill.  The law, which will come into effect once it has been signed by Austria’s president, Alexander Van der Bellen, over the coming days, has been followed with great interest across Europe, where other nations have considered taking a similar step. Already approved by the lower house of Austria’s parliament with a clear majority last month, Austria’s vaccine mandate is due to come into effect in three stages. Every household is to be informed of the new law via post by 15 March, after which police will start monitoring people’s immunisation status via spot checks and issuing fines of 600 euros, rising to up to 3,600 euros in case of non-compliance. In the third phase, those who cannot show proof of vaccination by a certain deadline are to be automatically fined, but it is unclear whether the government still keen to enforce its mandate to such a degree. In an interview with public broadcaster ORF on Thursday morning, health minister Wolfgang Mückstein was unable to give a date for the crucial deadline. As Austria has inched closer to a decision on mandatory vaccinations, the conservative-Greens coalition government of chancellor Karl Nehammer has simultaneously loosened restrictions for the unvaccinated. A “lockdown for the unvaccinated” was lifted on Monday, and shops, restaurants and hotels across most of the country will soon be able to receive visitors who haven’t got a jab, as long as they can show a recent negative test result. Political developments around the mandate have been followed closely in Germany, where government calls for a similar law have become more cautious in recent weeks. “Since the government announced the compulsory measure in mid-January, it has done everything to undermine, soften and make its own project redundant,” wrote Munich-based German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung in a comment piece. “The message is clear: we didn’t really mean it.” Gerald Loacker, a health spokesperson for liberal NEOS opposition party, said waning political enthusiasm for mandatory vaccinations was impossible to ignore. “What we are dealing with here is a vaccine mandate that comes into effect just as the government is making it possible for those who aren’t vaccinated to enter a bar with a subsidised free test result and raise a glass to their resistance,” Loacker told the Guardian. “That’s not a coherent policy, and people in Austria are taking note of that.” Karl Stöger, a professor of constitutional law at Vienna university, said that seeming incoherence was partly a deliberate choice. “The vaccination mandate has legal teeth, but it is also a law that is very aware of the limits of what a state can force people to do,” he said. Stöger, who has advised the government in its handling of the pandemic, said it was possible that Austria’s constitutional court could still stymie the vaccine mandate, especially if an “endemic” situation of the virus with low hospitalisation rates no longer makes vaccinations appear vital. Like many other European countries, Austria is experiencing record rates of Covid-19 infections, but the number of patients in intensive care beds with the virus is declining. With 68.8 % of its population having received at least two shots of a vaccine, however, the government argues that only mandatory vaccinations will bring immunisation rates to a sufficiently high level to weather another wave of the virus later this year. Last December’s emphatic endorsement of the vaccine mandate idea on behalf of the government, then still fronted by interim chancellor Alexander Schallenberg, has also made it politically difficult for the conservative Austrian People’s party (ÖVP) to change its mind without losing face. “There’s a sense the whole of Europe is watching us: a government U-turn at this stage would amount to a huge loss of face,” said Clemens Schuhmann, a journalist for Oberösterreichische Nachrichten newspaper. Yet enforcing the mandate could come with the risk of further stoking divisions in a society already polarised over the course of the pandemic. Upper Austria, the northern state that Schuhmann reports on, has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with fewer than 60% of residents fully vaccinated in some municipalities bordering on southern Germany. “Those who will get vaccinated because of the mandate are the ones who can’t afford to pay the fines”, he said. “The risk is that others will get further radicalised and rather go to prison than take the jab.”",News/World news,"Austria passes Covid vaccine mandate, but question marks linger over enforcement",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/austria-passes-covid-vaccine-mandate-but-question-marks-linger-over-enforcement
2/4/2022,"The Morrison government’s hopes of passing its contentious religious discrimination legislation before the election have been boosted with Labor offering conditional support. Labor has joined the Coalition in calling for the bills to be passed suggesting only minor and technical amendments when the bill comes back to the lower house on Tuesday.  The conditional support was outlined in two inquiry reports into the legislation that were released on Friday. But the bill still faces an uncertain path through parliament, with a group of three Liberal MPs stonewalling, and Liberal senator Andrew Bragg using the report from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs committee to call for broader changes. Labor has not ruled out amendments that could see it teaming up with Bragg, moderate Liberal MPs, the Greens and crossbench to add protections for LGBTQ+ teachers and students, or remove the bill’s other contentious clauses. The two reports were released as Scott Morrison confirmed on Friday it was his intention to add a prohibition on discriminating against students based on sexuality and gender in this legislation. In both the Senate inquiry and the joint human rights committee, Labor MPs and senators recognised the need to protect people from discrimination on the grounds of religion. Labor urged the government to reconsider two clauses overriding state laws, one allowing discriminatory statements grounded in religious belief or non-belief, and the other strengthening religious institutions’ ability to hire and fire staff based on faith. Submissions from state and territory anti-discrimination bodies, even in the Liberal states of Tasmania and New South Wales, warned the religious discrimination bill would override laws that prevent speech that offends, insults or humiliates people on the basis of protected attributes. States that had more limited powers for religious schools to hire and fire teachers based on their beliefs, such as reforms recently passed in Victoria, would also be overridden. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In the human rights committee, Labor MPs and senators urged the government “to work across the parliament – if not across the federation – to address the serious concerns that have been raised” about the clauses but recognised there was a “legitimate concern” that both were intended to address. “The Australian Labor party has a long history of fighting to prevent discrimination against people of faith,” they said. “The legislation that prime minister Morrison introduced should unite our nation, not divide.” The Senate committee recommended that the government consider constitutional concerns raised by Prof Anne Twomey about the statements of belief and employment clauses, but noted Prof Nicholas Aroney had supplied drafting to correct the issue without removing the clauses. The committee said if the constitutional issue was addressed, the Senate should pass the bills. The Public Interest Advocacy Centre’s policy manager, Alastair Lawrie, warned the new drafting would mean that statements that “offend, insult, or humiliate” people based on race – currently banned by section 18C of the racial discrimination act – would be legal, if grounded in religious belief.

But a remaining trio of holdouts – Liberal MPs Bridget Archer, Warren Entsch and Trent Zimmerman – have indicated the amendment would not be sufficient for their support. Their numbers in the lower house, and the crossbench in the Senate, could be crucial for further amendments to the bill, if Labor took on the task of fixing the bill from the opposition benches. But some in Labor argued it should use the moment to be rid of an issue that hurt it engaging with religious communities at the 2019 election. “There’s an opportunity to draw a line in the sand and have this behind us once and for all,” one Labor parliamentarian told Guardian Australia. “We need to stop talking about things the public don’t want us to talk about.” The bills were listed for debate in the lower house all day on Tuesday, and in the Senate, subject to introduction, on Wednesday. Anna Brown, the chief executive of national LGBTIQ+ organisation Equality Australia, said the reports left the bills with no clear pathway to pass parliament. Brown said the committees were “left with the pieces of a broken and friendless bill” after the government spent three years trying to solve problems of its own making as the bill was redrafted. “It’s no wonder they failed to find a way to fix it,” she said. “It is time to throw out this failed, experimental bill.”",News/Australia news,Labor offers conditional backing to Coalition’s religious discrimination bill,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/04/labor-offers-conditional-backing-to-coalitions-religious-discrimination-bill
