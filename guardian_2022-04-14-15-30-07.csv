4/14/2022,"The odd thing about “strongman” leaders is that they are often quite weak in terms of their personal attributes and political ideas. Vladimir Putin, in power longer than most, comes across as an insecure, embittered little man, strangely marooned in a cultural time warp, whose vision of Russia’s future is propelled by a backward-looking, sentimental nostalgia for the Soviet era. Donald Trump, by instinct a fellow authoritarian and avid Putin admirer, is notoriously thin-skinned, seemingly incapable of tolerating the slightest criticism and disproportionately vindictive towards those who challenge him. Xi Jinping, China’s ostensiblyall-powerful president, exhibits similar chronic fear of dissent, as seen in his ruthless purges of the ruling Communist party and crackdowns on Hong Kong’spro-democracy activists. Gideon Rachman’s accessible new book, The Age of the Strongman, examines these and other formidable, deeply flawed figures in a series of fluent, well-informed essays about the global rise of authoritarian, nationalist-populist leaders and its corrosive impact on the liberal democratic tradition. Rachman’s central thesis is that this is a modern phenomenon, roughly beginning with Putin’s rise to national power in 1999-2000. Rachman, a columnist and experienced foreign correspondent, views Putin as “the archetype and model for the current generation of strongman leaders”. His trademark tactics – reining in independent sources of power, asserting the central authority of the state and using warfare to bolster his personal position – have been emulated around the world by other reactionaries hostile to globalisation, liberalism and the western-led, rules-based international order. Lies, disinformation, institutional vandalism, the cult of personality, systemic corruption, ethno-nationalism, culture wars, historical revisionism and the ready use of violence at home and through external aggression – these are the ugly tools of Putinism. They’re now under close scrutiny following the invasion of Ukraine, but were plain to see for 20 years for those in Europe and the US who cared to look. Sadly, many did not. It will be frustrating for some that the book contains no analysis of the impact of the invasion that began on 24 February. There would have been considerable appetite for discussion of the future world order, or of the latest theories about Putin’s mindset – that he is detached from reality, ill, deluded by his own propaganda, or has simply gone nuts. If he fails in Ukraine, the age of the strongman, for Putin anyway, may draw to an abrupt close. Yet, as it is, Putin’s malign influence echoes through Rachman’s rogues’ gallery of autocrats. In China, Xi teeters towards megalomania. In Hungary, the newly re-elected Viktor Orbán resorts to antisemitism to sharpen ideas of national identity. In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu acts the divisive saviour, forever fighting encircling foes. In the US, Trump plays the same old tunes, attacking minorities, migrants and media. In the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte plays god, condemning and killing on a whim. Strongman leaders, Rachman suggests, tend to be pretty useless at leading. India’s Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, styles himself a man of the masses, in touch with the “real India”. But his proposed farm reforms in 2020 sparked unprecedented grassroots protests by the very people he claimed to uniquely understand. Rattled, his government blamed mysterious foreign forces – and Greta Thunberg. The aggressive behaviour of Turkey’s autocratic president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, reflects deep personal insecurity – greatly exacerbated by a coup attempt in 2016 when he came close to being shot by his own soldiers. Like an Ottoman sultan, Erdoğan has built himself a luxurious palace, safe on a hilltop overlooking Ankara, from where he irascibly surveys the chaos caused by his own economic illiteracy and political dysfunction. Like many strongmen, Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, was initially feted as a reformer. Then he triggered a humanitarian disaster in Yemen. The murder in 2018 of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi critic, all but destroyed his reputation in the west. Likewise, Ethiopia’s disgraced prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, won a Nobel peace prize, only to let hubris get the better of him when he picked a fight he couldn’t finish in Tigray. Yet the global trophy for sheer bloody incompetence must go to Brazil’s hard-right populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, the “Trump of South America”, whose lethally irresponsible mishandling of the pandemic stunned even his most ardent apologists. The strongman paradox arguably arises from confusion over the difference between brute power and resilience. The former is all about personal dominance, essentially antisocial and crudely enforced, usually without regard for law or justice or the rights of others. Resilience is about inner strength, resourcefulness and adaptability, arising from principle, conviction and belief in the collective rather than individual will. By this definition, a truly strong leader in today’s Russia might be Alexei Navalny, the courageous opposition activist whom Putin tried to poison and then jailed. In Turkey, Selahattin Demirtaş, the Kurdish opposition politician detained since 2016, comes to mind. In Iran, strong women such as the vilely persecuted human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh put hardline president Ebrahim Raisi to shame. As Rachman notes, authoritarian rulers have helped to undermine democratic ideals and practices around the world since 2000, and with growing success following the financial crash of 2008. “The last 15 years have seen the most sustained decline in political freedom around the world since the 1930s,” Rachman writes. Shockingly, democracy’s great bastion, America, came close to falling, too. “We have learned again that democracy is precious,” Joe Biden proclaimed at his inauguration, two weeks after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and tried to overturn the 2020 election. “Democracy is fragile ... and democracy has prevailed.” But the fact it very nearly didn’t is Rachman’s whole argument. Most Republicans still believe Trump’s big lie. He, and they, may try again in two years’ time. It’s easy to be pessimistic. Strongman leaders are a perennial blight. Before Putin, there was Stalin. Before Xi, Mao, before Erdoğan, Atatürk. In Poland, Jarosław Kaczyński was preceded in Warsaw Pact times by General Wojciech Jaruzelski. As Rachman concedes, history is often more cyclical than linear. “All efforts at historical periodisation are slightly artificial,” he writes. All the same, to the many oppressed, brutalised and disenfranchised peoples of the world – and especially to those now living in Ukraine – today’s age of the strongman feels all too terrifyingly real.

4/14/2022,"Former Colombia captain Freddy Rincón has died aged 55 after sustaining severe head injuries in a car crash. Rincón was hurt after the vehicle he was driving collided with a bus on Monday in Cali, Colombia. “Despite all the efforts of our teams, Freddy Eusebio Rincón Valencia has passed away,” said Laureano Quintero, the medical director of the Imbanaco Clinic in Cali where Rincón was being treated. Colombia’s football federation, the FCF, tweeted a tribute acknowledging the “great loss” and saying “we will miss him and remember him with great affection, appreciation, respect and admiration”. “The Colombian Football Federation deeply regrets the death of Freddy Eusebio Rincón Valencia, and sends a message of support and encouragement to his family, friends and relatives at this difficult time,” a statement read. Rincón was a commanding midfielder won 84 caps for his country, scoring 17 goals during in international career during which he was a key part of Colombia’s golden generation who took the national side to three consecutive World Cups in 1990, 1994 and 1998. He started his professional career with Colombian sides Santa Fa and América, winning national titles, before joining Brazilian outfit Palmeiras. In 1995, he signed with Real Madrid following a loan spell with Napoli and spent two seasons at the Bernabéu before returning to South America. In 2000 he captained the Brazilian side Corinthians to the first club world championship title. Rincón was involved in a serious car accident in 2013, when a truck he was driving overturned on a wet road between Cali and the city of Andalusia.

4/14/2022,"I replaced my gas boiler and hob with an electric one and have been trying, for three months, to get Scottish Power to disconnect the gas supply. In the meantime, I’m having to pay standing charges.AF, Bristol Your email trail with Scottish Power records staggering incompetence. First, you were wrongly told that you had to call the National Grid to get your meter capped before booking a removal appointment. The National Grid referred you to network provider GTC, which confirmed that removal did not require capping and that Scottish Power could do it, or appoint GTC to oblige for a fee. It asked Scottish Power to complete the relevant paperwork, but the latter told you it could not act as a go-between between customers and third parties. Scottish Power then referred you, bizarrely, to the National Grid emergencies helpline. Eventually, it conceded that it had given you the runaround and promised to book an appointment. Three days later, you were informed, baldly, that an appointment was not possible and that was the end of it, until I invoked the press office. An appointment was instantly conjured up and standing charges refunded, with £75 in goodwill. Scottish Power says: “We’re sorry for the incorrect advice the customer received. Normally, a customer would let us know they had made the switch and we would arrange for the meter to be removed.” Meanwhile, JR of Canterbury was being pursued by bills to his address, but in a stranger’s name, culminating, 18 months later, in a debt collection demand for £2,748. Scottish Power eventually issued an apology and a promise that the demands would cease, but JR was then warned bailiffs would enter his home if the debt wasn’t settled within 21 days. Scottish Power decided it could only close the account in the stranger’s name if he opened one in his own, which he duly did. The result was a demand for more than £3,000 and the threat of court proceedings. “My wife and I are in advanced years and this stress is making us ill,” he writes. Scottish Power’s press office discovered the mysterious truth: the stranger named in the bills had, for reasons unfathomable, applied online to move the electricity supply at JR’s address to Scottish Power in 2020 and paid the first bill before cancelling the direct debit. This means Scottish Power was supplying JR’s house all this time. He should have received a “sorry you’re leaving” notification from his previous supplier, which ceased billing him after his unwitting departure. Scottish Power reduced the bill to £1,000 and JR has now returned to his old supplier. According to Citizens Advice, householders may not be liable for bills if someone signs them up to a supplier without their permission, and should take advice before paying.

4/14/2022,"British film-maker Chris Atkins is known for his excellent Bafta-winning documentary Taking Liberties in 2007 and also for his five-year jail sentence in 2016 for tax fraud involving falsified invoices: a conviction that sent a there-but-for-grace-of-God shiver through the British film world. It resulted in Atkins’s bestselling prison memoir A Bit of a Stretch, which also became a hugely popular podcast. At the time I wrote about the heavy-handed prison treatment of Atkins’s co-defendant, Christina Slater, who at the time was a new mother. Now Atkins has hit upon the ideal subject for what I can only describe as his talent for investigative mischief: it’s the strange story of the KLF, later the K Foundation, comprising Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty, the electronic-pop-duo-slash-situationist–art-collective who in the early 90s had gigantic chart hits with singles including 3am Eternal and What Time Is Love?, and then morphed into a guerrilla unit pranking what they saw as the money-crazed art world. They finally deleted their entire catalogue in a spectacular gesture of renunciation, and publicly set fire to the remaining million pounds in their bank account. Atkins reconstructs some of the band’s occult events and theatre-of-the-absurd Guy Debord one-offs; he interviews some of the band’s gobsmacked contemporaries and fans such as journalist James Brown, author Alan Moore and DJ Carl Cox, and claims that his audio interviews with Drummond and Cauty used here are “previously unheard tapes” – although we don’t get to find out how and where these tapes surfaced. Could Atkins be playfully hinting that these tapes and the band’s apparent non-cooperation with his film are not quite what they seem? Either way, it’s a very entertaining guide through what has to be the strangest A-list pop career of modern times: a band who started weird and anti-materialistic, ended weird and anti-materialistic, and didn’t sell out. And as for the million-pound-blaze, Atkins does his best to reconstruct the band’s thinking. Most supposed the stunt to be either a pointless hoax or, if real, an obscene waste, given all the poverty in the world, and the film hints that the band themselves might just have had the nagging doubt that they had made a terrible mistake. It was a grand gesture which, to the extent that it was noticed at all, was a misfire. But it was a misfire born of their absolute refusal to conform to the careerist notion of success.Actually, this film reminded me of Banksy’s 2010 documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop, in which the artist showed off his cardboard box full of faked £10 notes with the face of Diana, Princess of Wales on them instead of the Queen’s – forgeries that could in theory have got him into serious trouble. You could end the film wondering if the KLF even existed at all, if they were a dream or a countercultural mirage. If so, this is an enjoyable journey across the surface of an illusion.

4/14/2022,"We live in a wonderful country peopled by many kind and fascinating souls. Just saying. It’s not said often enough. Over the past month, I’ve been all over the place making films for the BBC’s Countryfile programme. I’ve travelled by train and motorbike, marvelling every mile at the changing landscape. The train to Penzance, a long haul wherever you start from, was further delayed, but I cared not a jot with my nose pressed to the window all the way. When I finally arrived, I went to check something at the ticket office. “Alright Ade,” said the lady, in the strongest Black Country accent. I asked her what had brought her there. “I came here 20 years ago and I loved it, so I stayed,” she said. At times, with war raging despicably elsewhere, and the cost of living crisis biting, the places I’ve been to have felt quite indecently tranquil. Floating but barely moving in a coracle on the River Teifi in Pembrokeshire, time and space lost all meaning for too short a while. OK, the weather’s not been completely wonderful, but what of it? This week we filmed atop the Isle of Man’s second highest hill, from where the view is wonderful if you’re not enveloped in thick mist. I saw nothing but the camera crew, and I could barely see them if I strayed more than a few strides away. This mist, I learned, was the work of the Isle of Man’s kind of founding deity, Manannán. They call it his cloak, which he throws over the island to shroud the people, protecting them from their enemies. But I came in peace! No worries though, even sea gods make mistakes. Whatever the weather, I love this time of year. Spring has not quite shown itself in the trees; only the daffodils seem to have got the memo that it’s time to shine. Everything is full of promise. Bring it on.  Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,"From daffodils to thick mist, springtime in the UK feels indecently tranquil | Adrian Chiles",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/14/from-daffodils-to-thick-mist-springtime-in-the-uk-feels-indecently-tranquil
4/14/2022,"Breathing the incense-scented air and listening to the priest’s plaintive chant, we sat in darkness, lit only by the glimmer of the “eternal flame” – ferried over from Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulchre earlier that day. At midnight, the black-clad priest brandished the lantern aloft: “Xristos anesti!” “Christ has risen!” he cried. As if on cue, bells pealed wildly and firecrackers fizzed through the darkened streets of Palekastro in east Crete. “Alithos anesti!” “Truly He is Risen,” the crowd replied before lining up to light their candles from the flame, then scurrying home to make the smoky black cross on the lintel above their front doors, to bring protection for the following year. Unlike Easter in the UK, which is generally a more low-key affair, Greece’s Orthodox version of this ancient spring festival is one of the country’s biggest celebrations. It generally takes place in April (this year on the 24th) when Bermuda buttercups bloom bright in the olive groves, days are longer and warmer, and family members scattered around the world come home to celebrate with loved ones. “It’s like Christmas and New Year rolled into one,” a Greek pizza parlour owner from New York who was in Crete to see his 80-year-old mother told me, as we toasted each other with raki. “I wouldn’t miss it for the world.”Although most of the larger resorts are closed at this time of the year on the islands, many smaller hotels and more authentic local restaurants are open. Since there are fewer crowds and the weather is generally wonderful – warm enough for T-shirts but still cool enough for hiking – it’s one of my favourite times to visit. The first time I joined in these celebrations on Crete I’d been worried that I’d be imposing on what is essentially a family occasion. I soon discovered, however, that hospitable Greeks were more than happy to welcome me – a passing stranger – to their tables which were generally set up in the street outside their houses, groaning beneath the weight of grilled meat and meze snacks, and baskets of crimson eggs. Dyed to symbolise the blood of Christ, eggs are used for the tsougrisma, an egg-y version of conkers where the “weapons” are clutched in fists rather than held on strings. “Filoxenia – the love of strangers – is in our DNA,” one reveller said as she handed me a plate loaded with the traditional mastic-flavoured sweet bread tsoureki. From solemn, candle-lit processions on Good Friday to long, lazy lunches of butter-soft lamb, slow-roasted over charcoals on Easter Sunday – at the tables of local tavernas or in people’s homes – the main rituals of Orthodox Easter remain the same across the country, but there are countless regional variations. In a quest to see how other islands celebrated Greece’s biggest festival, I decided to check out Easter on Corfu. Mentioned in the Odyssey as the birthplace of blind musician Demodocus whose skill made Homer weep, Corfu is home to Greece’s first philharmonic orchestra, which was created in 1840 when Queen Victoria prohibited the participation of the British army band in the island’s Orthodox religious events. The island’s Easter celebrations inevitably involve a lot of music. Corfu now has about 17 orchestras and when I arrived on Good Friday I had difficulty deciding which epitaphios procession to follow – with each carrying a symbolic casket that represents Christ’s coffin. I finally headed out along candlelit cobbled streets behind the red-uniformed members of the Kapodistrias philharmonic band, who thudded solemnly ahead, plumed hats waving like feather dusters in time to Chopin’s funeral march. On Saturday I followed crowds to Spianada square in the city’s old town to discover this Ionian Island’s most spectacular tradition. At 11am, as bells rang out for what’s known locally as “the first resurrection”, on high balconies along the main square – and along the neighbouring pedestrian sidestreets known as cantounia – dozens of Corfiots emerged, dragging giant, water-filled clay pots called botides, and hurled them to the streets below, with cries of “Opa!” and “Xristos anesti!” As the red clay pots exploded on the glistening marble pavement, the crowd howled and cheered loudly. “It’s said that this first started with the Venetians,” one pot thrower told me. “When they occupied the island from the 14th to the late 18th century, they would throw old and useless objects from their windows to celebrate the new year, but we do it to worship God.” My final Easter experience, before Covid put the kibosh on Greek celebrations until this year, was on Tinos. A 20-minute ferry-hop away from Mykonos, this tiny member of the Cyclades islands is renowned for its marble sculptors. The author Lawrence Durrell described Tinos as “the Lourdes of modern Greece” because of its Panagia Evangelistria church, which attracts pilgrims from all over the country, and because Easter on this 194 sq km island is celebrated with particular fervour. On Friday evening, the church bells began their slow, rolling funeral toll and the Epitaphios of St Nicholas headed for island capital Chora’s tiny port, where the bearers – surrounded by a swarm of candlelit fishing boats – waded out into the freezing waters accompanied by the priest in full regalia. Then, on Saturday evening, as the bells rang out for the Resurrection, parishes across the island competed in making the loudest explosion with their “trombones” – traditional fireworks packed with gunpowder that look like old wooden muskets. “The trombones are so loud that we usually ask someone who is hard of hearing to light them,” said Maria, an inhabitant of the nearby mountain village of Kardiani who I met while watching the raucous spectacle. The last explosion faded and we hurried together through smoky streets to Chora where tavernas had thrown open their doors to celebrate. Maria invited me to sit with her family at one of the long trestle tables that tavernas had set up for the occasion. A musician began to play lively nisiótika island songs, a firecracker whistled high overhead, a donkey honked loudly and a gust of warm air riffled the paper tablecloth. “This is what the resurrection is all about,” said Maria, as we tucked into our magiritsa, the traditional broth made from lamb’s liver, lungs, head and intestines topped with avgolemono (egg and lemon) sauce that’s always served at Easter. “This is the real rebirth – when spring is in the air and winter is finally dead.”",Lifestyle/Travel,"My big, fat, Greek Easter: food and spectacle on Crete, Corfu and Tinos",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/14/my-big-fat-greek-easter-food-and-spectacle-on-crete-corfu-and-tinos
4/14/2022,"It will be a sunny Easter weekend for most of Australia, with light showers scattered across the country predicted to ease as people enjoy the festive period. After its wettest ever start to the year, Sydney is forecast to have a mostly sunny and dry long weekend. Senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology Jackson Browne said that while Easter is still a couple of days away and forecasts could change, Australians can start planning their weekend. “It will be a mild and mostly sunny start to the Easter long weekend across most parts of Australia with some isolated showers for south-east Western Australia, with showers and storms for the north-east Australian coast and Top End,” Browne said. The weather will be generally settled across most parts of Australia on Easter Saturday but late in the day, a cool change is expected to reach Perth, he said. “This front will move east across the country on Easter Sunday, bringing partly cloudy and showery conditions to southern South Australia, including Adelaide, and then Tasmania’s south-west and Victoria by Sunday night,” Browne said. Easter Monday is likely to bring cool, partly cloudy and showery conditions across southern Australia, including Perth, Adelaide, Hobart and Melbourne. The cold front will move across Victoria and up the south-east coast towards Sydney, with clouds building later in the day and cooler air and showers coming in overnight. There are a few flood warnings current for the area around the New South Wales-Queensland border, and residents are advised to keep checking for updates. BoM senior forecaster Miriam Bradbury said Victoria would generally experience mostly sunny conditions, following through until late Sunday when a cold front will bring some clouds up from the south-west as well as the chance of some isolated showers. “It’ll generally be fairly warm across the weekend with some warm northerly winds increasing on Sunday ahead of that front moving through, so maximum temperatures sitting in at least the mid-20s through Friday and Saturday pushing up to the high 20s,” Bradbury said. “For Queensland for the Easter weekend, we’re looking at some isolated showers across most of the east coast, turning more widespread in the wet tropics.” She said the maximum temperatures for Brisbane will generally sit at around 26-27C right throughout the little holiday period. Despite the flood warnings, she said New South Wales could expect to enjoy warmer weather, with maximum temperatures across the weekend sitting in the mid-20s. “We’re generally expecting a few showers to linger about the far northern coast, but otherwise fairly dry, warm and mostly sunny conditions especially during the earlier part of the weekend,” Bradbury said. That is thanks to a fairly dominant ridge of high pressure extending across the state. While flood-affected areas will get a much-needed break from the downpour, NSW emergency services minister Steph Cooke warns boaters, rock fishers, swimmers and surfers in NSW to take care around the water as they enjoy the sunshine. “The impact of the flooding and heavy rain has reached far and wide, with sunken debris and displaced navigational aids increasing the risks to those enjoying our waterways this Easter long weekend,” Cooke said on Thursday. “The weather can change quickly with very little warning.” She urged people to check the weather forecast and listen to authorities. Marine Rescue NSW commissioner Stacey Tannos said more than half of all calls for help received by marine rescue volunteers were due to engine, battery or fuel issues. Surf Life Saving NSW president George Shales said the Easter period was one of the most dangerous on the coast and urged people to swim between the flags at patrolled beaches. “Last Easter our volunteer surf lifesavers conducted more than 100 rescues and we sadly saw multiple fatalities. “We are expecting large numbers to head to the beach so please play it safe and listen to advice from lifesavers and lifeguards,” Shales said.

4/14/2022,"The deportation of a Rohingya women back to Myanmar has sparked fears that India is preparing to expel many more refugees from the country. Hasina Begum, 37, was deported from Indian-administered Kashmir two weeks ago, despite holding a UN verification of her refugee status, intended to protect holders from arbitrary detention. Begum was among 170 refugees arrested and detained in Jammu in March last year. Her husband and three children, who also have UN refugee status, remain in Kashmir. Days after her deportation, the authorities detained another 25 Rohingya refugees. They are being held in Hiranagar jail, which police described as a “holding centre” for Rohingya “illegally living” in India. “There are around 275 Rohingya detained in the holding centre, and documentation for deportation of all of them is complete,” said Prem Kumar Modi, the centre’s superintendent. “We are waiting for the government orders to send them back [to Myanmar].” The authorities gave no reason why Begum was selected for deportation. The move has heightened the insecurity of Rohingya living in India. In early 2019, hundreds left for Bangladesh, fearing detention and deportation when India began a campaign to record their biometric data. Action against the 40,000 Muslim Rohingya people has intensified since the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) came to power in 2014. BJP leaders have launched campaigns demanding the expulsion of all Rohingya. Ali Johar, Begum’s husband, said their children, aged nine to 15, did not understand why their mother has been separated from them. “They are crying,” he said. “I don’t know what to do and who to ask for help.” Begum was five months pregnant with her third child in 2012 when the family fled brutal violence at the hands of the Myanmar military in Sittwe. A further military crackdown in 2017 killed thousands and forced about 750,000 Rohingya into refugee camps in Bangladesh. “We came to India hoping that the secular country will provide us shelter till there is peace in our native land,” said Johar, who had found employment and was renting a place to live with other Rohingya families. The children saw their mother three times while she was in jail. “She would always cry, looking at us, and complain of bad living conditions in jail,” said her 15-year-old son, Hussain. “She was visibly frail and would plead with us to get her out somehow. When we would leave, she would always hit her head on the wall and cry.” Johar said he could not afford to miss a day of work to visit his wife. His children would accompany other people who were visiting their imprisoned family members. The children last saw their mother at the start of the year, and only learned of her deportation from media reports. Human rights groups have said Rohingya refugees are facing “life-threatening risks” in India and accused the authorities of “cruel disregard for human life and international law”. Rohingya refugees say they are afraid to go out for work. Although some refugees are now leaving Jammu for other cities in India or for Bangladesh, many are unable to do so because their family members remain in jail. A group of Rohingya refugees who left Jammu last week said they are waiting to cross over to Bangladesh, even though conditions for Rohingya refugees in the country is already worsening. “We do not want to be sent back to the country which has burned hundreds of us alive,” said a Rohingya refugee who wished to remain anonymous.",News/Global development,Deportation of Rohingya woman from India sparks fear of renewed crackdown,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/14/deportation-rohingya-woman-india-myanmar-fear-crackdown
4/14/2022,"Hello, I’m Warren Murray, and sad to say this is the final Guardian Morning Briefing. As you might have seen, the Briefing will relaunch in this space as First Edition from 25 April. A bit more to say after the papers section – but for now, on with the news. People seeking asylum in the UK will face the prospect of being flown 4,500 miles away to Rwanda. The planned government crackdown on unauthorised migrants has been described as “shameful” by Labour. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the government was choosing “control and punishment above compassion” when every Conservative PM since Churchill had provided “a fair hearing on British soil for those who claim asylum”. The PM is expected to announce measures including putting the navy in charge of Channel operations, and a reception centre instead of hotels to hold people – the first at a former RAF base in Linton-on-Ouse, North Yorkshire. The deal with Rwanda, which will reportedly cost an initial £120m, follows three years of promises by Priti Patel to outsource asylum processing to third countries, and failures to strike deals with Albania and Ghana. According to a 2020 Human Rights Watch report, detainees in Rwanda suffer from arbitrary detention, ill-treatment and torture in official and unofficial facilities. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said the Rwandan proposal was “unworkable, unethical and extortionate”. The United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR, said it was waiting to see the bilateral agreement, but “UNHCR does not support the externalisation of asylum states’ obligations”. Partygate not over – Boris Johnson is facing three more potential fines, according to senior sources, as he suffered his first ministerial resignation over Partygate – the Lords justice minister, David Wolfson. One policing source said an assessment by Met detectives that the PM breached the rules more than once meant the level of fine would go up with each instance. One Tory MP said they were deeply worried about a “drip-drip” of revelations ahead of local elections and the final Sue Gray report. “Each one of these will come as a hammer into the nail of the Tory coffin and what the PM is doing is implicating all the MPs in this. We are in a long, slow death march.” By Wednesday afternoon, momentum appeared to have stalled among Tory MPs prepared to oust Johnson, although several confirmed sending letters of no confidence to the party’s 1922 Committee. A number of others leapt to his defence. Subway arrest – The man suspected of firing more than 30 shots in a gun attack on a New York subway train is in custody charged with a federal terror offence. Frank R James, 62, was arrested on Wednesday afternoon in Manhattan by two patrol officers without incident. Officials said James was apprehended thanks to a tip that came in from a McDonald’s on First Avenue where a member of the public took photographs and called Crime Stoppers. Officers patrolled the area and found James. “We could have not done this without the public’s help,” an FBI officer said. At least four schoolchildren aged 12 to 16 are believed to be among the 29 injured passengers requiring medical treatment after suffering from bullet wounds, smoke inhalation, falls and panic. Five of 10 people shot were reported to be in critical but stable condition; another 19 were injured, though nobody was reported to be in life-threatening condition. Russian warship ‘seriously damaged’ – The flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet has been crippled and its crew evacuated after an explosion. A Ukrainian official earlier claimed, without providing evidence, that its forces had hit the Moskva with missile strikes. The Odesa governor, Maksym Marchenko, said: “It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where it was sent by our border guards on Snake Island.” On the first day of the invasion, the small island garrison refused calls to surrender, telling the ship to “go fuck yourself”. More than 1,000 Ukrainian marines defending Mariupol have surrendered and the port has been captured, Moscow has said, as the presidents of four countries bordering Russia arrived in Kyiv in a show of support for Ukraine. This morning, our defence editor Dan Sabbagh charts how Russian use of indiscriminate weapons has plumbed the depths, including the possible but as-yet unconfirmed release of a chemical agent in Mariupol.

Staff sickness and a shortage of workers have already been causing chaos for air passengers, while ferry operators have struggled to meet demand as P&O Ferries services remain suspended. The Easter weekend is the first public holiday since the lifting of almost all Covid travel restrictions. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said in a BBC interview it would be “extremely busy on our roads, potentially at our ports, particularly at Dover”. Network Rail has advised passengers to travel either side of the long weekend because it is closing parts of the system for engineering works – more details in our full story. Motorists may also face traffic jams as the RAC estimates 21m leisure journeys by car will take place this weekend. Covid catches up – Operations are being cancelled across England as Covid causes “major disruption” inside the NHS, the country’s top surgeon has said. Six million are on the waiting list for hospital care, including more than 23,000 waiting more than two years. Boris Johnson in February hailed “the biggest catch-up programme in the history of the health service” but in the same month dropped every domestic Covid restriction. Now, more than 28,000 NHS staff are off work every day due to Covid, while more than 20,000 patients are in hospital with it. “We have heard that planned surgery is being cancelled again in different parts of the country due to staff being off sick with the virus,” said Prof Neil Mortensen, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. The British Medical Association accused the government of failing to grasp the threat of Covid to the NHS, backlog targets and wider society. NHS England said staff “continue to pull out all the stops” to tackle the backlog. Another Brexit dividend – Ecologists in Gibraltar have told how the island was almost overwhelmed by its own rubbish because of Brexit. Waste from the territory was usually processed in the Spanish province of Cádiz, but things were left in limbo with Britain’s exit from the EU. Six thousand tonnes of trash had soon piled up. Equipment was rushed in from the UK to shred and compact the rubbish. They were thinking about storing it all in Gibraltar’s underground tunnels, but eventually Madrid signed off on continuing to process rubbish from the outpost. The last bits of refuse were cleared just as Gibraltar was hit with a fierce storm and swells of more than four metres. “If we had had that kind of powerful storm when the rubbish was there, we would be talking about plastic scattered across the strait of Gibraltar,” said Antonio Muñoz, from a local ecological group. He says he will pay the penalties issued by the Met police, but he is not resigning – at least, not yet. Are Tory MPs prepared to push the prime minister out of office?

Our food system isn’t ready for the climate crisis. It was fraught, it was suffocating, it was full-blooded – entirely as billed – and it blew up in the 89th minute with a mass melee between the players of both Atlético Madrid and Manchester City, including plenty of substitutes. At the centre was scampering scoundrel Phil Foden, who beat Diego Simeone at his own game before Pep Guardiola claimed he had never criticised Atlético’s style. Benfica salvaged pride at Anfield whereas Liverpool preserved dreams of a seventh European crown and unprecedented quadruple. Jürgen Klopp will consider it a decent exchange. One of Britain’s most prestigious women’s cycling races is on the verge of being saved 24 hours after its longstanding sponsor pulled out in protest against British Cycling’s suspension of its transgender policy. Montpellier and former Bath forward Zach Mercer has reflected on being capped too early for England and the Top 14 leaders’ status as unlikely underdogs. Kenny Shiels’s talk of “emotional” women is unacceptable; the Northern Ireland Women manager’s comments send a poor message and were not adequately addressed by his apology. Asian shares have mostly tracked Wall Street higher today. Traders are awaiting a European Central Bank meeting later in the day. There have been gains on the markets in Australia, China and the Nikkei, while South Korea’s Kospi index fell after the central bank unexpectedly raised its policy rate to 1.5%, the highest since August 2019, as it seeks to quell inflation. Futures trading has the FTSE opening higher at time of writing, while the pound is on $1.313 and €1.204 at present. In our Guardian print edition today the lead story is “Johnson may face three more fines in party scandal”. Also on the front: members of Scientists for Extinction Rebellion have pasted pages of scientific papers to the windows of the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and glued their hands to the glass to highlight the climate science they say the government is ignoring. The Mirror has “Worst is to come, PM” as Boris Johnson faces three more possible Partygate fines. “Tory law chief quits” says the Metro, in reference to Lord Wolfson’s protest at the PM “breaking the law with impunity”. The Financial Times has “Russia menace edges Finland and Sweden closer to Nato entry”, which you can read about here. “Channel migrants to be sent to Rwanda” says the Telegraph, and the splash headline in the Times is much the same. The former has a basement story on university graduates facing a £3,000 hit as student loan interest rates go up. Others lap up the Rwanda offshore processing news: “Rwanda plan to smash the channel gangs” says the Daily Mail, and it’s a “bold” plan in the eyes of the Express, which hopes it will “end the small boats crisis”. The i says “Patel in Rwanda signing deal to export Britain’s asylum seekers”. And the Sun says “Take Matt”, about Matt Hancock and how a government inquiry has ended its “witch-hunt” into who leaked footage of him sharing a “lockdown-breaking office clinch” with Gina Coladangelo. No one is being charged.
