3/20/2022,"It seems hard to credit, but in the days before the likes of Vladimir Putin and P&O Ferries showed their true colours, Uber was regarded by many in London as one of the more suspect foreign arrivals. This week, however, the global ride-hailing firm will once again find out if it is on the naughty step, when its licence to operate in one of its biggest markets comes up for renewal. Its first private hire licence, along with thousands more for its drivers, came without too much fuss in 2012 from Transport for London, who were keen to embrace the latest technology in everything from tickets to traffic lights – even as the traditional London cabby cried foul at the new US cock of the walk. Renewing that licence has been a different matter. Uber will be hoping this will be the third time lucky, after being knocked back twice in the space of two years and having to suffer the indignity of pleading to a magistrate for a conditional extension. Are they now, in the parlance, “fit and proper”? Few would want to prejudge TfL, whose reasons for turning down Uber in 2017 and 2019 had largely flown under the radar. Beforehand, opponents from the taxi trade had focused on being undercut by lost Prius drivers unable to do a three-point turn, while socially aware campaigners cried foul at Uber’s payment and “partner” arrangements. Instead, safety and security problems came to the fore. TfL cited Uber’s failure to report alleged offences to the police in 2017. Then, after beefing up reporting protocols, in 2019 Uber was slapped down because drivers had worked under fake identities. Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi had just come in as the new broom after alarming claims of boardroom harassment did for founder Travis Kalanick in 2017. Khosrowshahi flew in to promise mayor Sadiq Khan that the firm would change. If the first instance was a pivotal moment in what might be called new Uber, the repeat treatment provoked some indignation in the San Francisco global HQ. In 2019, Khosrowshahi simply tweeted that TfL’s decision was “just wrong”, after “fundamental change”. Both times, Uber remained able to operate pending appeals, and no doubt will again should the licence due to expire on 27 March not be renewed. But it will remain an important corporate verdict – particularly given the wider overtones from Sadiq Khan that Uber had not been “playing by the rules”. And Uber’s boss for UK and northern Europe, a cycling north Londoner, Jamie Heywood, might feel particularly aggrieved, after introducing schemes to push the uptake of electric vehicles in the capital, and winning the support of the GMB union after concessions on holiday pay for drivers. Uber has backed Khan’s plans to expand the ultra-low emission zone and tried to marry up consumer desire for electric cabs with the reality of drivers – now finally described as its workforce, rather than partners – who typically live in flats in east London without the kind of charging infrastructure more swiftly installed in the Tesla-owning boroughs. With rivals such as Bolt now competing directly for passengers and drivers with virtually identical apps, Uber has been the first to change its business model – admittedly, under legal direction – to finally acknowledge that the passenger is booking direct with Uber rather than the driver. That has tax implications – pushing up fares in the UK, at a time when many customers may already be feeling the pinch. According to TfL, the VAT now payable on cab fares is a matter for HMRC and has no bearing on the licence. But Uber is, at least, quickly complying with a condition that will now apply to all. With revenues globally averaging nearly $2bn a month, and offshoots such as food delivery via Uber Eats growing profitable, London and its 50,000 Uber drivers may not be a pivotal part of the business. But global reputation still counts for something – and an undisputed licence would go some way to wipe the tarnish from the Uber brand.",News/Technology,Uber hopes for an easier ride with its new London licence,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/20/uber-hopes-for-an-easier-ride-with-its-new-london-licence

3/20/2022,"Coronavirus booster vaccine jabs for millions of people in England will begin to be offered this week, the NHS announced. The vaccine will be available to care home residents, people who are 75 and over, and the immunosuppressed aged 12 and over. About 5 million people are expected to be given the jab, with 600,000 invited to book their dose this week. The booster announcement came as the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed a resurgence of Covid cases is under way across the UK, with infections in the over-70s at a record high and school leaders fearing that preparations for A-levels and GCSEs are being disrupted by outbreaks among staff and students. Based on random swab testing, the ONS estimates almost 5% of the population in England, or 1,544,600 people, had Covid in the week ending 12 March, and 3.5% of people in the oldest age group. Infections also reached a record high in Scotland, where one in 14 tested positive. Sarah Crofts, at the ONS Infection Survey, said: “These latest figures show further increases in infections across most of the UK with high levels of infection everywhere. It’s notable also that infections have risen in all age groups, with the over-70s reaching their highest estimate since our survey began.” Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said: “Following the massive success of the rollout so far, we are now offering over-75s and the most vulnerable a spring booster dose to top up their protection against this virus.” The NHS Covid-19 vaccination programme will contact people when it is their turn to be vaccinated again and, once they have an invitation, they will be able to book their appointment through the National Booking System either online or by calling NHS 119. Local NHS teams will also be administering the jab in care homes. Last week, the seven-day average for UK hospital admissions related to Covid rose above 1,700, with more than half being admitted directly because of Covid, the NHS Confederation said. NHS staff absences have begun to rise again, while emergency departments are also under pressure. NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said: “The NHS Covid-19 vaccination programme has not stopped in its efforts to protect people from coronavirus – around 5 million of the most vulnerable people will be eligible for a spring dose and from tomorrow, we will start giving eligible groups their additional top-up in protection. “We have protected millions of people at speed thanks to the efforts of our staff, aided by volunteers. They will once again rise to the next challenge.”",News/World news,5m people in England to be offered Covid booster jabs ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/5m-people-in-england-to-be-offered-covid-booster-jabs

3/20/2022,"You could measure the gap between England and France by the 12 points difference on the scoreboard. Or you could measure it by the inches between Ben Youngs’ outstretched hand and Antoine Dupont’s shorts as Youngs launched himself headfirst into a futile dive after the best player in the world and tried to drag him back as he cut England apart. You could measure it in the feet England were shoved backwards at the scrum just before half-time where they conceded yet another set-piece penalty, or you could measure it by the acres of space France found out on the right wing when they created the three-on-one overlap that led to their first try. The answer’s the same either way: a lot, and more than England’s coach, Eddie Jones, is letting on. Really, the best way to capture the distance between them might be in years. France have been building towards this grand slam ever since the last World Cup, when their current coach, Fabien Galthié, was already in place, deputy and heir apparent, to his predecessor, Jacques Brunel. In the years since, Galthié and his boss, Bernard Laporte, have turned France’s run at the World Cup they host next year into a national project. They haven’t just put together a team of coaches and a squad of players, but they have pulled in the Top 14 clubs and the French fans, too. There’s a sense that everyone’s pulling in the same direction. So Galthié’s team have been three years in the making. Jones’s, on the other hand, feels like they have barely had three weeks. Somehow they are still starting out all over. That’s Jones’s choice, as he chops and drops and changes his backroom staff, his training squad and his match-day 23, while he tries to work out exactly what “new England” looks like. He keeps talking about how they are steps forward, but it’s beginning to feel as if they are standing still. He was at it again on Saturday night. “We’re moving in the right direction,” Jones said, “we’re not far away.” They are. In the first half, in particular, England were out of their depth. They showed plenty of heart, but they weren’t strong enough to break France open, weren’t fast enough to stretch them apart, weren’t slick enough to outsmart them, or disciplined enough to shut them down and stop them scoring. For all their effort, they didn’t once make it into the French 22 in those first 40 minutes and were fortunate that they were only 18-6 down at the break. Their play all felt over-engineered, dependent on training-ground ploys such as having Ellis Genge truck the ball up from deep, or Marcus Smith kick it crossfield. It was as if they were playing to a formula they had concocted during the week and decided to stick with it even though it wasn’t working for them. And the trouble was, in the time it took them to change it up, France had all but gone and won the game. They’ve never once been behind at half-time in any of 26 Tests they’ve played since Galthié became head coach. And England’s best chance of beating them here depended on changing that by getting ahead and putting them under a kind of pressure they had never experienced before. Instead, England worked hard and went nowhere, while making sloppy mistakes, and giving away penalties. In the second half, presumably after Jones and his fellow coaches had intervened, England did change the way they were playing. Smith, who played the first half as if he was doing his best impression of Owen Farrell, finally started to do the things that got him picked in the first place, like run and pass. And there was a moment there when it did all click: Joe Marchant made a fine break off a lineout and, after he was caught by the shorts, Smith stepped up, worked an intricate little loop with Jamie George, fed the ball on to Elliot Daly, who sent it on again to Freddie Steward, who scored in the corner. Here at last was a vision of an England who could compete with the best team in the world. Steward, who had his best game yet, launched another attack with a superb catch off his own garryowen, Henry Slade was up at first receiver, spitting fast flat passes, and then the moment went again, while Smith tucked in behind him. For those 15 minutes, England played with the intensity and verve they needed to display for the whole 80 if they were going to win this match. If Jones is right, and they really are moving forwards, England will be back here in 20 months or so, when, according to his plan, they will be playing in the World Cup semi-finals, maybe against this same French team. It sounds a long time now, but it only adds up to a handful of games, three in the summer on tour in Australia, three more in the autumn, and another run at the Six Nations, then they are into the warm-ups. Eleven games then, just under 15 hours of match time. It’s not long to make up that gap, however you measure it.",Sport/Sport,Jones’s claims of England’s progress ring hollow as France highlight gulf in class | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/19/eddiejones-six-nations-claims-of-englands-progress-ring-hollow-as-france-highlight-gulf-in-class
3/20/2022,"Eddie Jones refused to address his future as England’s head coach but conceded he had “not done a good enough job” after his side ended another disappointing Six Nations campaign with a comprehensive defeat by France. England were outscored three tries to one as France wrapped up their first title in 12 years and a grand slam to boot, leaving Jones’s side with just two wins and three defeats from the tournament for the second year in a row. Results earlier in the day ensured England finish the championship in third place in the table – an improvement on last year’s fifth-place finish – but with only three tries scored, the victory over Italy notwithstanding, Jones has come under increasing criticism as the Six Nations has worn on and questions continue to be raised over his suitability for the job. After last year’s tournament the Rugby Football Union conducted a review into England’s performance before giving Jones its backing to continue and, with less than 18 months until the start of the 2023 World Cup, similar introspection is required at Twickenham. Asked whether he was still the best person to coach England he said: “That is not a question I need to answer. I just do my job, it is a question for other people to answer. I am not even thinking about that.” He added: “I’m disappointed, disappointed for the fans, for the players, I obviously haven’t done a good enough job, I accept that, but we’re moving in the right direction. The results aren’t good enough. When you rebuild a team it takes time. “France are deserved champions of the Six Nations, they are the best team, but we had enough chances to win that game, we just didn’t put them away, we were not quite clinical enough in doing that. That has been a little bit of the story of us in the Six Nations, we have put ourselves in position to win the three games we have lost but not been clinical enough, not been good enough, particularly in some of our clean out work to win those games. So that is disappointing but the spirit we showed is going to make sure this team keeps moving in the right direction.” France were nervous in patches against Jones’s side, who did rally to 18-13 early in the second half after Freddie Steward’s score before Antoine Dupont’s try effectively settled the contest. If it was not a vintage French performance, the gulf between the two sides was evident. “It is a great benchmark game for us,” added Jones. “We are not far away but we are far away and the effort it takes to bridge that gap is important. We have got a lot of good young players coming through and some of the older guys are starting to play some really good rugby again so we are going to have a good blend going through to the World Cup.” Gaël Fickou scored France’s first try, rounding off a period of prolonged French pressure before François Cros added the second on the stroke of half-time. Jones highlighted that score – and the moment when England replacement Alex Dombrandt was held up over the tryline in the second half – as key moments. “There were a couple of really big moments in the game,” said Jones. “The try before half-time gave France a bit of breathing space and then we had Dombrandt held over the line. We get that and at that stage we are making the running in the game and that would have put a lot of additional pressure on France with thoughts of the grand slam.”",Sport/Sport,Eddie Jones admits ‘results aren’t good enough’ as England lick wounds,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/eddie-jones-admits-results-arent-good-enough-as-england-lick-wounds
3/20/2022,"Government ministers knew about P&O Ferries’ plan to slash 800 jobs before staff were informed but were told by officials it would ensure the firm remained “a key player in the UK market for years to come”, it was claimed on Saturday. A leaked memo, apparently written by a senior Whitehall official, justified the mass redundancies, stating that “without these decisions, an estimated 2,200 staff would likely lose their jobs”. The memo, said to have been written before ferry staff were told their jobs were being lost last Thursday, said the redundancies “will align them [P&O] with other companies in the market who have undertaken a large reduction in staff previously”. The memo was “widely shared across government”, including copies to the prime minister’s private office while the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, is understood to have received a copy, the Sunday Times reported. Louise Haigh, Labour’s shadow transport secretary, said: “This proves the government was not only aware of P&O ferries’ scandalous action but complicit in it. “They knew people’s livelihoods were on the line and they knew P&O was attempting to use exploitative fire and rehire practices. But they sat back and did nothing. The shambolic response to this shameful episode proves the Conservatives cannot and will not stand up for British workers.” A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “This was an internal government memo which, as standard practice, outlined what officials had been told by P&O Ferries shortly before their announcement was made. This was sent before ministers were advised of the full details. As soon as they were informed, they made clear their outrage at the way in which P&O staff had been dismissed.” P&O Ferries has been accused of wanting to exploit a loophole in minimum wage laws to draft in cheap foreign workers for its vessels. The company has previously faced allegations of hiring crew for as little as £1.83 an hour, because the national minimum wage laws do not apply on international sea routes. Union officials say P&O may be able to cut its wage bill by up to half. MPs are furious at the mass sackings via online video by a firm that has relied on more than £10m of taxpayers’ support to pay staff wages during the pandemic. Ministers face urgent calls to review the operations of its Dubai-based owner DP World, which also operates ports at London Gateway and Southampton. Karl Turner, the Labour MP for Hull East, said: “They can now bring in cheaper crews because the national minimum wage laws do not apply. It is an outrage, and the government needs to urgently close this loophole.” P&O’s ferry fleet was ordered to dock on Thursday and staff were told it was their final day of employment. The company said it had made a £100m loss in a year, and “swift and significant” changes were needed. P&O suspended services on routes between Dover and Calais, Larne in Northern Ireland and Cairnryan in Scotland, Dublin and Liverpool, and Hull and Rotterdam. New crews are already in place, and P&O’s Liverpool-Dublin crossings resumed on Saturday afternoon. DP World paid £322m for P&O Ferries in February 2019. The chairman and group chief executive is Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, and it is ultimately owned by Dubai’s ruling royal family. In May 2020, the firm announced up to 1,100 redundancies, the majority of which were crew in Hull and Dover. Unions warned MPs they were concerned about a long-term plan to replace UK-based crews with “low-cost foreign crews”. Surveys by the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) and contracts have previously revealed P&O has been at the bottom or near bottom of the league table of pay for overseas staff. In 2019, an ITF survey claimed that P&O was paying catering staff a basic hourly rate as low as £1.83, excluding overtime. Staff from Poland, Portugal and the Philippines complained they were struggling to cope with working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, for two months at a time.",News/Business,Ministers ‘told in advance about P&O mass sackings’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/19/ministers-told-in-advance-about-po-mass-sackings
3/20/2022,"Firefighters have been dealing with a suspected deliberately started fire on marshland on the Wirral. Fire engines were scrambled to the scene where about 500 sq metres of marsh were in flames at Parkgate, 10km from Liverpool city centre, at about 6.20pm on Saturday. Cheshire fire and rescue service said six fire engines were on site with firefighters initially battling two areas of flames with beaters and hoses. However, at about 9.20pm it said one fire engine had withdrawn and crews were leaving the fire to burn due to unstable ground. The fire service said crews are expected to remain at the scene of the blaze on Neston marsh until about 2am. Fire breaks are being maintained to protect properties and people are asked to stay away from the area while the blaze is being dealt with. The fire service added that police have been advised it is suspected that the blaze was started deliberately and a fire investigator is due to attend. Carl Nevitt, a station manager and the officer in charge of the incident, said: “The marshland is a site of special scientific interest. The fire is covering around one square kilometre of the area and is being driven by wind. “We have created fire breaks to protect properties and the police air support unit has been used to give us information on the directional spread of the blaze. “We expect to remain at the scene for at least the next three to four hours and would ask that people stay away from the area as we tackle the fire.”",News/UK news,Fire burning on Wirral marshland believed deliberately started,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/19/fire-burning-on-wirral-marshland-believed-deliberately-started
