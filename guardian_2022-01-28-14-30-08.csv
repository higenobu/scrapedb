1/28/2022,"For the first time in two years we’re out planting trees again, part of a volunteer crew working for the Eastern Moors Partnership, currently transforming the moors on the western fringes of Sheffield. When all is done, around 280 hectares of trees will have been planted. Our leader, John Mead, explains that today’s area has been planted once already, an experiment that has gone awry. In an attempt to avoid more unsightly plastic tubes, this patch was fenced to keep off sheep and planted with unguarded whips. Unhappily, they haven’t prospered. The fence kept sheep out, but not the small herd of red deer that roams these moors. The whips have been munched and we must start again, this time with tubes.  My partner and I look at each other. Weren’t we part of the crew that planted this patch last time? Yes we were. What has happened to our work? Moving through the bracken, it’s clear at least some of the young trees are still alive, bravely persevering. We ask John if we can go to their rescue. If they’ve made it this far, then surely with help they can make it through. He gives his blessing and we start combing the moor for saplings worth saving. Some have been chewed, others flattened by bracken going over in the autumn. Operating a system of arboreal triage, we tube some, mostly rowan, alder and birch, and leave those that seem beyond hope. Then we find our first oak. Less than a foot high, it’s standing proud of some heather, still wearing all its leaves, now dried and coppery. Not shedding leaves in autumn – common practice among oaks and beeches, especially young ones – is called marcescence. Why they do this is still not properly understood. It may be to protect young buds from frost and wind. Or else deter browsers, since the dried leaves are bitter, although red deer will still browse oaks with their leaves on. Or the delay may mean the leaves mulch later, when the young tree really needs the nutrients. Between us all we plant 500 trees; my partner and I rescue another 40. This little one seems humming with life, so we carefully protect it and move on.

1/28/2022,"Gina Rinehart, a global warming denier and the wealthiest person in Australia, cannot protect the sports she sponsors from the impact of the climate crisis. But should they be protecting Rinehart’s reputation from the condemnation that is increasingly directed at those who stand in the way of climate action? That is the question on the lips of many Australian athletes following the announcement on Friday that Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting was becoming a major partner of the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) in a four-year deal. Just days after being appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for, among other things, her distinguished service “to sport as a patron”, Rinehart has increased her already considerable involvement with Australian Olympic sport. But at a time of growing athlete activism around climate action, the appropriateness of the AOC lending its social licence to Rinehart and Hancock Prospecting is in doubt.  In 2020, the AOC became a signatory to the United Nations Sports for Climate Action Framework. “We will certainly be advocating with our stakeholders the importance of conserving vital resources, reducing and recycling waste, promoting environmental stewardship and tackling global warming,” an AOC spokesperson said last month, prior to the deal being announced. Have they told Rinehart, who has called climate science “propaganda”? In recent years, the 67-year-old has poured money into Australian Olympic sports. Her annual contribution across swimming, rowing, volleyball and artistic (synchronised) swimming is estimated to exceed $10m, even before Friday’s announcement (an AOC spokesperson refused to put a dollar figure on the new deal). Hancock Prospecting billboards dominate Australian swim meets, while Rowing Australia’s high performance centre in Penrith is named after the iron ore miner. The sports often describe Rinehart as their “patron” in official communications and have awards and events in her honour. The billionaire’s choice of sports is noteworthy. Although swimming and rowing are both major contributors to the Australia’s Olympic medal tally, neither – nor volleyball or artistic swimming – is a commercial heavyweight. Despite all four receiving federal government support to varying extents (swimming is the best-funded, at over $9m this year), athletes do not typically enjoy the professional salaries commonplace in other elite sports. Rinehart, whose wealth is estimated at $31bn, has sought to fill this gap. She provides at least $1.4m annually to rowing, which goes to a weekly wage of $525 for the top 50 Australian rowers. Rinehart has a similar arrangement with swimming, providing salary-style funding for athletes across three tiers, with the highest-tier receiving about $32,000 per year. “I don’t say this lightly, but Gina Rinehart saved swimming,” veteran Cate Campbell told the Australian Financial Review during last year’s Tokyo Olympics, where she won two gold medals. “Gina Rinehart stepped in [after sponsors had withdrawn funding in 2012]. She made funds available that went directly to athletes. This allowed many athletes – myself included – to see that there was a future career in swimming for us.” Following the successful Tokyo 2020 campaign, Rinehart gifted earrings, designed by the magnate herself and made by Australian jeweller Paspaley, to female athletes in each of the sports she supports. Male athletes received Apple laptops. “The ongoing generosity of Mrs Rinehart in support of these Olympic and Paralympic teams is incredible,” Liberal senator Hollie Hughes told parliament in November, updating the Senate on Rinehart’s post-Tokyo gifting spree. “So many athletes are able to reach their dreams because of her support.” Rinehart’s annual funding is equivalent to about one-tenth of the Australian Institute of Sport’s total high performance investment allocation this financial year. Underscoring the significance of her involvement, Rinehart-funded sports accounted for 11 of the nation’s 17 Olympic golds in Tokyo and 26 of Australia’s total haul of 46 medals. In a video published on Rinehart’s website, Swimming Australia’s stars sung the praises of their benefactor following the Games. “You have been our number one cheerleader every step of the way,” Campbell said. Two-time bronze medallist in Tokyo, Alex Graham, added: “Without your support, of course, none of it would have been possible – and we are extremely grateful.” Other swimmers to feature in the video included Bronte Campbell, Jess Hansen and Ellie Cole. So what? What does it matter if Australia’s richest citizen chooses to splash her largesse on otherwise underfunded sports? If Australia’s swimmers, rowers and volleyballers can train full time thanks to Rinehart’s funding, and wear pearl earrings on nice occasions, all the better? And surely a major funding boost for the AOC can only be a good thing? Alongside her sporting passions, Rinehart has been outspoken in her views on climate change and continues to support climate change denial. In 2018, it emerged in legal proceedings that Hancock Prospecting had donated almost $5m to the Institute of Public Affairs, a conservative thinktank that has consistently promoted global warming scepticism. She also admitted to bringing prominent climate change sceptics Lord Christopher Monckton and Prof Ian Plimer to address students at a high school after learning that they had been shown Al Gore’s climate film An Inconvenient Truth. In a speech in November, Rinehart described Australia’s official attendance at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow as a “waste [of] taxpayers’ money” and mocked the job-creating potential of renewable energy. “I know the miles of solar panels will need wiping to be effective, and the millions of dead bats and birds – lives claimed by wind power infrastructure – will need collecting and burying,” she said. (While wind turbines do impact wildlife, fossil fuel production – and domestic cats – kill far more birds.) Rinehart is also an influential backer of the National party. She hosted deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce’s first fundraiser following his return to the leadership, and has previously flown Joyce to a wedding in India on a private jet. In 2017, Rinehart gave Joyce a personal cheque for $40,000 at a gala dinner, although he returned the money following criticism. The Nationals, as is well known, are the major blockers of climate action in the governing Liberal-National coalition. Joyce is believed to have opposed the Morrison government’s net zero by 2050 target. All of which sits uneasily with the growing climate activism of Australian athletes and sports. The Campbell sisters are among the hundreds of athletes to have joined the Cool Down initiative, championed by David and Emma Pocock, which seeks to use sporting profile to promote climate action. “If climate action was the Olympics, Australia isn’t winning gold, we’re not making the finals, in fact, we don’t even qualify,” its website says. In 2021, the Climate Council, a leading Australian climate NGO, published a report on sport and climate change, titled Game, Set, Match: Calling Time on Climate Inaction. Among the high-profile athletes to speak out following the report’s release were Bronte Campbell, Australian cricket captain Pat Cummins, surfer Adrian Buchan and AFLW star Sharni Layton. “Australia’s summer of sport is under threat from climate change,” Dr Martin Rice, the Climate Council’s head of research, told Guardian Australia. “Climate change, driven by the burning of coal, oil and gas, is worsening extreme weather events and disrupting Australian sport. By 2040, heatwaves in Sydney and Melbourne could reach highs of 50C, threatening the viability of summer sport as it is currently played. “Sport is a powerful force for climate solutions,” Rice continued. “When it comes to sponsorship, professional and community sports should switch from fossil fuel-backed companies to ones that invest in climate solutions.” Rinehart is not alone in both sponsoring sport and resisting climate action. Oil and gas company Santos is a major sponsor of the Tour Down Under cycling and the Wallabies, while Adani – which is currently developing the Carmichael coalmine, expected to cause 200m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions – has its logo on the sleeve of the North Queensland Cowboys. Woodside, which in December signalled its intent to proceed with a gas development that will release 1.37bn tonnes of CO2, has been the Fremantle Dockers’ major sponsor for over a decade. Former Wallabies captain Pocock recently described fossil fuel sponsorship as “the new cigarette sponsorship.” But Rinehart’s involvement is closer, more personal and now, following the AOC deal, even more high-profile. She and her company are not just engaging in a transactional commercial sponsorship, but buying an intimate relationship with these sports and athletes. Her personal gifts to Olympians is indicative of that atypical involvement. By directly paying athlete wages, often bypassing the national sporting organisation entirely, Rinehart has also secured an ongoing relationship less easily replaced by traditional sponsorships. Cate Campbell, in her video message to Rinehart, noted that the billionaire had personally travelled to Cairns to farewell the team before they departed for Tokyo. “Seeing you waving us off as we took off to go and take on the world in Tokyo gave us that little bit of extra motivation that we needed to take on the best in the world,” said the four-time Olympian. Rinehart has also reportedly become close with silver medal-winning beach volleyballer Taliqua Clancy, who told The Australian newspaper “Mrs Rinehart has been amazing ... and with her support our journey to this point has been possible. We have missed her in Tokyo.” Guardian Australia sought comment from Swimming Australia, Rowing Australia, Artistic Swimming Australia, Volleyball Australia and the Australian Olympic Committee. The sports were asked whether their acceptance of Rinehart’s support might inhibit athletes from pursuing climate activism, whether the organisations had a position on climate action and net zero, and why they had not signed up to the Cool Down (organisational signatories include the AFL Players Association and Professional Footballers Association, but no major sporting peak bodies). A spokesperson for Swimming Australia said that it does not currently receive any direct financial support from Hancock Prospecting or Rinehart. Hancock Prospecting was previously a significant sponsor of Swimming Australia, including as a headline sponsor for major events (the company’s signage was prominently poolside at the Olympic trials earlier this year). Guardian Australia understands that the underlying commercial agreement was not renewed. “Our athletes often voice their opinions on issues they feel passionately about, including climate action,” the spokesperson said. The AOC confirmed that, prior to Friday’s deal, neither it nor its foundation had received any financial support from Rinehart or Hancock Prospecting. However, in 2014, Rinehart was awarded the AOC’s Order of Merit. An AOC spokesperson said: “We have no concerns [about athletes being silenced]. Athletes with strongly held convictions on important issues are entitled to express their views with the same freedom as any individual.” None of the other sporting organisations replied to requests for comment. Guardian Australia also unsuccessfully sought comment from Cate and Bronte Campbell via their agent. In a statement published by the AOC following Friday’s announcement, Rinehart said “our company has been a long-term supporter of the summer Olympic sports of artistic swimming, rowing and volleyball for many years, and specifically over 30 years for swimming. We are so proud to help our great Olympians who are such inspirations, through their hard work, most do not really know how hard they work, dedication, focus and self-discipline, as they endeavour to represent our country to the best of their ability. The traits these role models show in my view, are important for us all, if we wish to succeed in life and business.” With the new AOC deal and the 2032 Olympics confirmed for Brisbane, Rinehart’s involvement in Australian sport is only likely to grow. The billionaire has been a conspicuous presence at a number of events in Queensland celebrating the successful bid. Rinehart made headlines at an Olympic lunch in late November, where she appeared alongside the likes of Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, for her presentation complaining about the lack of facilities to moor her superyacht along the Queensland coast. “I am booked into Paris [2024 Olympics] for all four sports that I am involved in,” she told The Australian newspaper following an Olympic-themed Property Council event last year. “I have been asked to continue to Los Angeles [2028]. You never know I am an elderly vintage but I rather hope I am around for 2032 as well.” She confirmed that intent on Friday, expressing her desire to “continue this all the way until and including Brisbane 2032”. Rinehart may be steadfast in her support for Australian Olympic sport. But unless her position on climate action evolves, the sports and athletes that accept her funding will face an increasingly acute dilemma. What is the cost, to athletes and sports, of accepting money from an influential denier of global warming? And what is the cost to our planet? Last winter, the iconic Manly beach had been left battered following a major storm – the kind that now hits with greater frequency and eroding force. On the disturbed sand stood askew sponsorship banners for Hancock Prospecting, the mining company owned by Rinehart, surrounding a beach volleyball court. The juxtaposition was stark. Friday’s deal only underscores the dissonance. When increasing heat impacts Summer Olympics and a lack of snow sours Winter Games, the AOC will not be blameless.",News/Business,Should Australia’s major sports stars really be defined by fossil fuel companies trying to look good?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/28/should-australias-major-sports-stars-really-be-defined-by-fossil-fuel-companies-trying-to-look-good
1/28/2022,"This week we asked Guardian New Zealand readers about the arrival of Omicron and how they are feeling and preparing. Hundreds of New Zealanders wrote in, about their hopes and anxieties, preparations and frustrations, confidence and worries. The country has spent almost two years relatively sheltered from the pandemic’s worst effects, and many said they felt some trepidation at the prospect of widespread Covid, and the threat it could pose to the country’s small health system, as well as its immunocompromised or under-vaccinated communities. Some were concerned about divisions the pandemic had produced: between the vaccinated and unvaccinated, those inside the border and those locked out.  But many also expressed a sense of relief and inevitability – and a sense that the timing was as good as it may ever be for Aotearoa to fall back into step with the rest of the world. Some have been long separated from their families, and found consolation in the prospect of reopening borders. And many felt quietly confident, bolstered by the country’s results so far. New Zealand had weathered each stage of the pandemic before, they said, and they trusted both the government and fellow New Zealanders to meet the next challenge. This is a small sampling of the comments. NZ just hasn’t suffered the kind of personalised trauma happening overseas, and summer makes a lot of people shrug at the prospect of doom. The not knowing how it will play out is almost as bad as the anticipation of personal and societal harm; how vulnerable ARE we as a population? How will our mental health _ not great at the best of times – weather the compound stressors? … Crossing all the fingers at the moment.Kelly, writer and photographer, Dunedin I think we are all feeling a sense of trepidation and worry. Throughout the pandemic we have watched what has happened overseas whilst keeping the virus at bay for two years. Now we face the inevitable that Omicron is here and we can no longer keep Covid at bay. There is the worry for the health system, our communities, particularly those who are vulnerable or immunocompromised. You can’t help but think: I am going to get Covid now, will it be OK? Will my family be OK? Here in NZ, we just haven’t had to deal with huge case numbers and deaths, nor are we in the mindset of just accepting those numbers. And currently it feels like we are just waiting for it all to begin.Saffron Dunlop, 46, Auckland, marketing I want to stop being frightened and put the whole ghastly business behind me whilst, at the same time, observing reasonable restrictions to keep the vulnerable safe. Recently the reality of Omicron in the community has given me the impression that we will all get the virus at some stage, but vaccinations provide protection against severe infection. I am respecting the science, I have had my booster, now bring it on!Mari Bennett, 73, north of Auckland I am worried about Omicron, but accepting that the outbreak is coming. All my whānau have been vaccinated, and are – where eligible – boosted. I mask up with an N95, track my movements on the Covid app, cut out attending or holding larger events, and have gone or go virtual where I can … Just trying not to be a dick! Kia kaha, Aotearoa: he eke waka noa – we are all in the same canoe.Sam Young, 59, Nelson lecturer I think resignation mostly. We all knew Omicron would break through eventually. As an asthmatic, yes I feel a degree of trepidation, but I got the vaccination, and I’ve had the booster, and I’m pretty consistent with mask-wearing. So really, from now on it’s a case of suck it and see. I am profoundly grateful to not be sent back into lockdown though … At least with vaccination I can live a pretty normal life now.Elizabeth Revel, 71, cardiac nurse The government has done a fine job in keeping deaths to a mere 50 or so. They have generated great confidence. Omicron may be different in its transmissibility but New Zealanders will, I think, rise to the challenge … Our vaccine situation is amazingly good and that will help too. No sweat.Dave Smith, 75, lawyer, Wellington “I think that the silver lining of reaching this stage is the change it will bring to border settings. There are so many families affected by the border restrictions. I have a friend whose dad [overseas] … died last year – I sat with her while she watched his live-streamed funeral and had to grieve without her family. It probably doesn’t seem much in the scale of things, but I have a cousin’s wedding to go to in the UK in June and it’s really important to me that my parents, siblings, nieces and nephews can see us and our kids. That time when they’re little goes so fast.”Fiona Macdonald, civil servant, Wellington I can’t help feeling that New Zealand is about to be surprised in a very unpleasant way by the reality of Covid’s exponential spread … I’m very concerned. I feel New Zealand is about to experience – albeit maybe without the large numbers of deaths due to Omicron’s milder nature – what the rest of the world had in 2020. That is, huge disruption to supply chains, working life, and massive social anxiety.Tom Hawkins, 32, maths and statistics teacher This feels inevitable. We couldn’t keep Covid-19 out for ever. We know the drill. Masks, hand washing, physical distancing, using the Covid-19 app, and keeping up with the vaccine and booster. I feel prepared. I am hoping for the best. Hoping Omicron is mild. Hoping it increases our immunity. Hoping we all stay safe and healthy.Nicki Frances, 53, science technical writer, Lower Hutt I feel safe in the hands of such capable leadership, and a community that by and large understands the need for individual action to serve the greater societal good. Kiwis are, despite a tiny but vocal proportion … extremely proud of how we defeated Covid with lockdown, then defeated Delta with lockdown, and now with 94% of adults double vaxxed feel we are ready to face Omicron without a lockdown. As for how I am coping with the red traffic light? Well, for the majority it’s really little different to how we’ve lived in non lockdown times … Doing my part to help the country basically involves missing a beer festival and not going to the cricket. We are so very fortunate here and send our aroha (love) to all people whose countries who have been less fortunate, and arguably less well led.Dan Hanid, 46, Palmerston North",News/World news,"Confident, optimistic, anxious: New Zealand readers tell us how they feel about Omicron",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/confident-optimistic-anxious-new-zealand-readers-tell-us-how-they-feel-about-omicron
1/28/2022,"The US navy is racing to salvage an F-35C fighter jet from the bottom of the South China Sea after it crashed on an aircraft carrier and plunged overboard – taking with it highly classified technology that would be a coup if China retrieved it first. The F-35C crashed-landed on the deck of the USS Carl Vinson during routine operations on Monday, the navy said, injuring six sailors and the pilot, who ejected from the plane before it fell into the sea.  The most advanced US fighter, a stealth plane costing over $100m, is packed with highly classified technology and if found would represent an intelligence boon for China, which claims almost all of the South China Sea as its own territory. The Vinson was on a patrol intended to challenge that territorial claim and defend international freedom of navigation. The F-35C is a version of the plane specially designed to operate from aircraft carriers. Maritime experts have said it could take a US salvage ship more than 10 days to reach the site of the crash, potentially giving Chinese submarines the opportunity to find it first. “We’re certainly mindful of the value of an F-35 in every respect of what value means,” said John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman. “And as we continue to attempt recovery of the aircraft we’re going to do it obviously with safety foremost in mind, but clearly our own national security interests. And I think I will just leave it at that.” In Beijing the foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said the Chinese government had no ambitions to find the crashed plane. “I noted relevant reports. This is not the first time that the US has an accident in the South China Sea,” he said. “We have no interest in their aircraft. We urge the country concerned to do things that are conducive to regional peace and stability, rather than flex muscles in the region.” In 2001, a heavily damaged American EP-3 surveillance plane made a daredevil emergency landing on China’s Hainan island after a collision with a pursuing Chinese fighter plane. The fighter crashed and its pilot was killed. The 24 crew of the EP-3, who had been lucky to survive the collision, were detained and interrogated by Chinese authorities before their release 10 days later. Meanwhile, the Chinese military stripped and examined the EP-3’s highly classified equipment and intelligence materials over several months – eventually giving back the plane in pieces. It is the third time an F-35 has crashed into the sea and had to be salvaged. In November a British F-35B, the short takeoff and vertical landing version, crashed as it lost power taking off from the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth in the Mediterranean. The pilot ejected and the plane was recovered from the seabed a few weeks later. In April 2019 a Japanese F-35A, the conventional takeoff and landing version, crashed at over 1,000km/h into the Pacific, leaving the pilot dead and only debris to be recovered.",News/World news,F-35C crash leaves US fighter jet sunken in hostile South China Sea,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/f-35c-crash-leaves-us-fighter-jet-sunken-in-hostile-south-china-sea
1/28/2022,"An eight-year-old boy has inspired a developer to relaunch a popular mobile game after it became defunct, leaving his father desperate to find a solution. Jack, who was diagnosed with autism, became enamoured with the game Joe Danger – a motorbike-riding daredevil who takes players on a race across the desert – as a source of joy and a way to cope with stress.  However, updates to Apple’s iOS operating system rendered it defunct and prompted his father to write to the developer for help. “Jack is 8 years old, about the sweetest kid on the planet, and has been diagnosed with autism,” the father wrote in a plea to Hello Games, more widely known as the makers of No Man’s Sky. “Jack LOVES Joe. He loves everything about him. He has a collection of toy motorcycles that are his ‘Joe Dangers’; every motorcycle we see on the street is ‘Joe Danger’,” the letter continued. “One of the things that has enabled Jack and I to bond is our shared love of video games, specifically Joe Danger,” the father says before recounting how one of the first things he hears every day when walking in the door after a day at work is: “Come on, Daddy, let’s go play Joe Danger!” “Just being able to say that sentence is a MASSIVE deal for a child with autism,” the letter adds. A secret shame of ours is that the success of No Man’s Sky left our first game Joe Danger unloved. Sadly since iOS culled older games it no longer worked on latest Apple devices 😭This mail broke our hearts and made us want to set things right 💔 pic.twitter.com/Oz2yTjMUK5 As well as a source of “endless hours of entertainment and joy”, the game has enabled his son to interact with friends and family, provided a coping mechanism and reward for getting through stressful situations and allowed Jack to “experience normal kid stuff”, his dad says. His letter asks the developers if they can bring the game back online. “It would mean the world to at least one little boy.” Company founder Sean Murray said the letter “broke our hearts and made us want to set things right”. “As game devs [developers] it’s so easy to underestimate the impact even your smallest games can have,” he said in a Twitter thread where he shared the father’s letter online. Murray said the team had undertaken a “hobby project” to bring the game back to life online, “slowly rebuilding it piece by piece through eight years of technology changes”. “It blows my mind that something you make can be someone’s first game they played, hit at an important time or even be their favourite thing for a while.” As game devs it's so easy to underestimate the impact even your smallest games can have. It blows my mind that something you make can be someone's first game they played, hit at an important time or even be their favorite thing for a while 🙏 pic.twitter.com/9coaI8C7ao The game, relaunched on iOS on Thursday, has been remastered with improved visuals, high frame rate, ProMotion and Gamepad support, according to the developers. It was also the first game the team developed when “we were still four guys in a shed, trying to get noticed”, Murray said. “Joe helped us get a break and it’s also where we learned to make games … It’s sad that games slowly rot and many disappear.” News of the relaunch has been welcomed by the gaming community, eager to download what some described as their “favourite mobile games of all time”. Signing off his letter to the game’s founders, the father said: “As a parent, it’s hard to put into words the feeling I get seeing the pure joy on Jack’s face Joe Danger brings, knowing the other struggles he experiences everyday. But I can assure you, the feeling is a good one.”",Arts/Games,‘Broke our hearts’: boy with autism inspires relaunch of popular game,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/28/broke-our-hearts-boy-with-autism-inspires-relaunch-of-popular-game
