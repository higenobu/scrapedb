5/1/2022,"Next slide please. We soon caught on to the way it worked. Chris Whitty would give the word and up would pop a chart detailing the progress being made in the fight against Covid-19. There are memes and mugs to commemorate the catchphrase of England’s chief medical officer. Whitty’s presentations detailed infection rates, hospitalisations and deaths. Within weeks of the pandemic’s arrival in early 2020 the public knew about the R number – a way of assessing how fast the virus was spreading. Over the months, public concern about Covid-19 has faded and it is now well behind inflation in the list of concerns troubling voters. Rising prices have meant increased scrutiny of the way Britain calculates the cost of living, including from the chef and activist Jack Monroe. The Office for National Statistics calculates the annual inflation rate by collecting the price of 700 goods and services at various locations and online, but says it wants to know more about price movements and how spending habits are changing. Almost certainly, the next big economic debate will be whether the UK is heading for recession. In 2008, output had already been falling for several months before it was reflected in the quarterly figures for gross domestic product. Since then, there has been the introduction of monthly GDP figures and since the pandemic the use of experimental figures designed to provide real-time indicators on the state of the economy. These include card payments, the number of people eating out and traffic density. The common thread that links these three examples is data. Governments have always seen the link between data and policy decisions. William I’s Domesday Book was an early stab at a national audit for 11th-century England. In 1801 concern about whether there would be enough food for a growing population prompted the first census covering England, Scotland and Wales. Over time, the state has found out more and more about how its citizens live, to the point where there is a legitimate debate to be had about invasion of privacy. It is not just governments, however. Use of loyalty cards gives retailers information about our spending habits. Tech companies such as Facebook and Google know what every user is interested in and tailor the ads that pop up accordingly. Getting the balance right is not easy. Ministers needed accurate data to monitor the impact of the lockdown on infection rates. The Bank of England needs enough information to be able to calibrate the right level of interest rates. Life has moved on from the early 1930s when the lack of accurate and comprehensive data hindered the response to the Great Depression in the US. But not everywhere. In some parts of the world, investment in data collection and analysis is abysmally low. Four in 10 of the world’s deaths are unregistered. More than a quarter of children overall and more than half of children in sub-Saharan Africa under the age of five were not registered at birth. A Google search for the world’s population brings up the number 7.9 billion but that’s really just an educated guess. The same applies to human development indicators such as infant mortality or literacy rates. There’s more. Only one in six countries have sufficient data to report on progress towards hitting climate change targets and on average the latest emissions data is from 2015. Two-thirds of countries have been forced to postpone a planned census due to the pandemic. The UN has a set of sustainable development goals to be hit by 2030: in only six of the 17 have more than two-thirds of countries data to report. A paper published jointly by the UN, the World Bank and the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (a network of more than 600 partners from tech giants to civil society groups) says the issues are most pressing where the challenges are greatest. Gaps in the data are glaring for gender in all areas of development: economic opportunities, environment, health, human security and public participation. Clearly, technology has a role to play in plugging these gaps and in some cases is already doing so. Ghana, for example, set up a partnership between its national statistics office, Vodafone Ghana and the Swedish nonprofit foundation Flowminder to track mobility and help in public health emergency planning. Two other ingredients are needed. The first is money, because after a 10-year period in which aid for data systems has flatlined there is now a financing gap of more than $1bn. For donor countries, spending money on statisticians is simply not as glamorous as spending money on a new hospital, even though better data would lead to better health care. The World Bank and the UN launched a campaign last week to raise at least $500m over the next 10 years, which they believe could act as the catalyst for billions of dollars of overseas development assistance and private sector funding. The second ingredient is governance, where there is a need to ensure low-income countries are not stripped of data in the way they have too often been stripped of their natural resources. A long history of exploitation means care must be given to ensure potential benefits from improved data is shared fairly. Facebook is expanding in Africa and so is Huawei: safeguards are needed to ensure this investment serves the public good. Even so, the message is clear. If the world is serious about tackling climate change, it needs better data. If it wants to have better defences against future pandemics it needs better data. If it wants faster growth in poorer countries it needs better data. Making decisions in the dark is not sensible.

5/1/2022,"Thanks to their clean-cut image and crystal clear harmonies, the Osmonds sold over 100m records worldwide. Their smash hits make the right kind of crowd melt, swoon and sway. All the classics, including Puppy Love and Love Me For a Reason, are in this new musical. And then some. You get an awful lot of Osmond for your buck. Heavenly for some. A little bit much for the rest of us. The book has been written by middle child Jay Osmond in conjunction with director Shaun Kerrison. It’s fairly zippy but barely digs beneath the squeaky clean surface. There are tantalising glimpses of a much more interesting story – especially in the flashbacks with military dad George Osmond (Charlie Allen), who made his kids get up at 4.30am to practise. It can’t have been much of a childhood. One particular phrase sticks in the mind: ‘It doesn’t matter who’s in front, as long as it’s an Osmond.’ That’s one hell of a line to live by. It’s only near the end of the show that we get a feel for the tension this kind of mantra might have caused. The musical suggests that thanks to some bad business decisions, the whole family loses everything. Finally the ugly emotions are released. Anger. Resentment. Jealousy. Just as quickly, though, it’s all very tidily shoved back under the carpet. Besides their stratospheric success, which peaked in the 70s, the Osmonds were also one of the first families to grow up on TV – an idea cleverly encapsulated by Lucy Osborne’s vibrant set, which frames the stage in a series of diminishing TV screens. There’s a particularly strange scene when we watch a five-year-old Donny Osmond sing live on TV. Young Osian Salter belts out the song with impressive abandon and it is parcelled up as wholesome but feels unsettling. Still, the group numbers are hip-swayingly good fun, Ryan Anderson finds piercing heartache in Merril’s solo numbers and Georgia Lennon’s Marie deserves a country music spin-off show all to herself. Each of the Osmonds might have made for a fascinating story. But all lumped together? Too thin. Too samey. Too nice.

5/1/2022,"One of the mysteries of Covid is how it hits the fit. Before January, I was one of those people. I ran 30 miles a week. I could turn up to a 20-mile fell race on inadequate training and run it, thoughtlessly. I did yoga, weight training and cycling. I had a low resting heart rate and strong biceps. For a 52-year-old menopausal woman, I was in extremely good shape. But then on 3 January I fell ill with a sore throat, then flu-like weakness, a cough that hasn’t left me since, and a constant and persistent headache that is resistant to every painkiller. In the months since, I have been not ill, but not well. I have days of feeling fine, and then I don’t. As a runner, I can say that long Covid feels like the wall at mile 18 in a marathon, when suddenly your energy has gone, and you feel like a different person and you don’t know why. It’s appropriate to use a running analogy, because it seems that runners, triathletes, cyclists and other formerly fit people populate the long Covid forums in far greater numbers than you’d expect if, like me, you assumed that fitness and health were the perfect shield. My long Covid is suspected by my GP, since I never actually tested positive, but many on the forums had only mild infections and are still suffering. Some are now in wheelchairs, or confined to bed, or disabled, or dysfunctional, and they post on social media groups that can be wonderfully precise: Long Covid for Endurance Athletes is one group I found extremely helpful (a name that caused a Crohn’s-afflicted friend to say wistfully: “Is there a group for former TV writers with a poo bag?”). I suppose I am lucky that I have long Covid now, when science believes in it and there are long Covid clinics. The NHS Covid recovery site must be helpful for many, and it discusses PEM (post-exertional malaise) which is the delayed-onset crash after exercise and is one of the most frustrating mysteries about any post-viral condition: you exercise and feel fine, and two days later you suddenly don’t. But the NHS site and most others seem meant for people who can’t walk upstairs, not ones who wonder whether they will be able to run in heart zone 3 again, or ever do more than three miles without fearing the consequences; the ones who are not disabled but not themselves. I turned, of course, to Google. I learned that people with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), or myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), have been floored by PEM for decades and only now are they being believed. I learned that perhaps Covid is lurking in my gut, or making my mast cells fire when they shouldn’t, and that I should be careful of my heart because doing too much can give me myocarditis. But my heart is fine, along with my X-rayed lungs and my blood, once a drop in my infection-fighting white blood cells had recovered. Whatever Covid is doing to me, it is doing it quietly and sneakily. It is stealth that characterises long Covid’s baffling array of symptoms and sufferers’ equally baffling tendency to get better, then relapse, sometimes for no reason. A Lancet study found that long Covid sufferers reported on average more than 50 symptoms during their illness, across an average of 9.1 organ systems. Yet Covid, according to our government, is no longer a concern. Never mind that everyone I talk to about long Covid knows someone with it, that more than a million Britons have it, and almost two-thirds of those say it has significantly limited their daily activities. One in 16 people now have Covid, according to Imperial College London’s April React study, 40% more than at Omicron’s “peak” in January, and the highest number ever. Sometimes I feel as though I am gaslighting myself. I can walk around so I can’t be ill. I can work, so I can’t be ill. Sometimes I can run, so I can’t be ill. But then I remember: once there was a time when I didn’t always have a headache. I used to be able to laugh without coughing. I used to walk to the shops half a mile away without wondering how I would find the strength to walk home again. I am so much better off than most, the ones who have debilitating brain fog, who cannot work or walk. But still I mourn the thoughtlessness of good health, the time when, to borrow a phrase from the writer Sinéad Gleeson, my body was an afterthought. I trusted it. Now I can’t rely on my body because I don’t know what’s happening to it, and neither does anyone else. “I’m so sorry,” said my lovely GP, phoning me from her home because she had Covid. “We’re in the dark.” As are employment lawyers, still struggling to understand whether workers missing with long Covid have a disability or an occupational health condition. What is certain is that long Covid is costing us hugely, and not just in money. Rose George has written for the Guardian, New York Times, London Review of Books and others.

5/1/2022,"Hundreds of Ukrainian families are pulling out of the Homes for Ukraine scheme because of delays in issuing visas to travel to the UK, with some subsequently returning to their wartorn country. Not only are frustrated Ukrainian refugees withdrawing from the scheme after waiting up to six weeks for a visa to materialise, but UK sponsors are also deciding to walk away because of problems with issuing visas to families fleeing the war. Following claims made last week by a whistleblower, the Observer has been inundated with cases of sponsors reporting difficulties in providing a home for Ukrainian refugees. One group, Holme Valley Homes for Ukraine in west Yorkshire, said that out of 160 applicants to the scheme a quarter – 40 – had pulled out because of delays in trying to obtain a visa to travel. The EU, by contrast, has waived the need for Ukrainians to have a visa. “Families are pulling out and choosing not to come to the UK because of the amount of time it is taking for visas to come through,” said Rebecca Gough, one of the coordinators of the Holme Valley sponsor scheme. On Saturday morning a family of six Ukrainians told the group that they would be staying in Romania because of the visa delay. At the same time a UK sponsor decided they could not wait any longer for a Ukrainian Muslim family who had endured racism when they fled to Poland and are now “destitute” in Baghdad. The most common obstacle appears to be families who do not receive visas for all its members. The whistleblower, who was working on the Homes for Ukraine helpline, revealed that he had dealt with numerous cases where UK visas had been issued for an entire Ukrainian family apart from one member, which in effect stopped the family travelling to the UK but allowed the government to say it had issued a number of visas. The allegations forced Home Office minister Kevin Foster to respond last week, telling parliament that claims that Ukrainian children were not being granted visas to prevent their families from travelling to the UK as “absolute nonsense”. But last Thursday the government acknowledged that processing problems within the Home Office had led to delays. Gough said they had seen a lot of cases dating back to when the scheme was announced on 14 March, where visas hadn’t been issued to one family member, but the rest had been granted. “I have seen so many cases of parents without children and children without parents so they can’t travel. This scheme isn’t good news, it’s a disaster,” she added. Gough also revealed that a number of Ukrainians had grown weary of waiting for a UK visa despite having a sponsor and had returned to the Mariupol area. “They have not been in contact for 10 days and we fear the worst,” said Gough. She added that a number of cases they were working on under the Homes for Ukraine scheme had ended up with the children involved being trafficked as they waited for permission to travel to the UK. “There is lots of trafficking, lots of children going missing. People that we were in touch we have subsequently heard from their friends that they have been trafficked,” said Gough. Sponsor Ginny Macbeth, from Wivenhoe, Kent, said that she had heard of cases where Ukrainians had become angry with UK homeowners following weeks of delay, not realising the British government was to blame. “They are assuming they have messed it up,” she said. Macbeth revealed that of the family of five Ukrainians she was hoping to help, four had received visas except their middle child, aged four. The parents, film-makers who run an international human rights documentary film festival, fled Kyiv with their children when their street was shelled and are now in Bucharest, Romania. The government said: “Thanks to the generosity of the public who have offered their homes to Ukrainians fleeing the war and through our Ukraine Family Scheme, more than 86,000 visas have been granted with over 27,000 Ukrainians arriving safely in the UK. “We are processing thousands of visas a day – this shows the changes we made to streamline the service are working and we’ll continue to build on this success so we can speed up the process even further.”",News/UK news,Hundreds of Ukrainian families halt bids to reach UK after visa delays,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/01/hundreds-of-ukrainian-families-halt-bids-to-reach-uk-after-visa-delays
5/1/2022,"The Liberal Democrats view themselves as the likely challengers to the Conservatives in the forthcoming Tiverton and Honiton byelection, Ed Davey has said, despite his party finishing behind Labour in the past three general elections. The Conservatives have held the Devon seat continuously since it was created in 1997, but could face a tough battle following the resignation of MP Neil Parish after he admitted twice watching pornography in the House of Commons chamber. While Labour have finished ahead of the Lib Dems in the constituency at every general election since 2015, Davey’s party is set to declare itself the most likely to defeat the Tories based on stronger local election results in the area. This is what they did in December’s North Shropshire byelection, coming from a distant third in 2019 behind the Tories and Labour to win the Conservative stronghold by nearly 6,000 votes after the resignation of another disgraced MP, Owen Paterson. Asked about his party’s chances in Tiverton and Honiton, Davey told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show: “I believe the Liberal Democrats can be the real challengers in that. We have a real legacy of success across the south-west. “We showed in the North Shropshire byelection, where we were third at the previous general election but we beat the Conservatives. No one gave us a chance, but in those rural communities across North Shropshire we found lifelong Conservatives who feel they have been taken for granted.” The Lib Dems and Labour vehemently reject the idea of formal pacts, with both Davey and Keir Starmer denying their parties had stood aside in some areas in this Thursday’s local elections. However, both have shown a willingness to campaign less hard in seats where the other has a better chance of defeating the Conservatives. The Lib Dems would be expected to do this in the other looming byelection, in Wakefield, where Labour hopes to regain the seat following the resignation of the Tory MP Imran Ahmad Khan after he was convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. A Labour source said: “All parties are sensible about putting in the appropriate time and resources to seats where they have the best chance of winning, or creating a good story by gaining ground.” Asked whether the Lib Dems were deliberately standing aside on Thursday in areas such as the north-east of England, where the party is fielding candidates in 56% of council seats, against 78% when they were last fought four years ago, Davey denied any deal. “There’s no pact now, there’s not going to be a pact in the future,” he told the Ridge show. “The Liberal Democrats are actually fighting Labour in many areas: in Hull, in Sunderland, in Sheffield, in Haringey, in Southwark. “These council numbers are a bit of a distraction, and pretty desperate from the Conservatives. Let’s remember, they always fluctuate from election to election. And actually, the Conservatives are fielding over 100 fewer candidates this time.” Starmer also dismissed the idea of a secret pact, as alleged by the Conservative party chair, Oliver Dowden. “I wouldn’t take anything Oliver Dowden says particularly seriously,” he told the Ridge show. “There is no pact, everybody knows there is no pact.”",News/Politics,"Lib Dems are the real challengers in Neil Parish’s seat, says Ed Davey",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/01/lib-dems-are-the-real-challengers-in-neil-parishs-seat-says-ed-davey
5/1/2022,"Ashraf (Dana Haqjoo), born in Egypt, longtime resident of Wigan, loves his taxi. Almost all of the 27 scenes of this play are set inside, or near to, this cab. To be a driver is a form of freedom, and a vehicle becomes an extension of an individual, a microcosm of their world. But if you don’t own your car, if you cannot drive, what then? The ideas may not be new but they are still powerful, and the strongest element in this paint-by-numbers east-meets-west comedy, with its 1970s central-casting roster of characters and distasteful over-reliance on non-native speakers’ idiomatic use of English to raise laughs from the audience. Written by Shamia Chalabi – who also plays Ashraf’s daughter, Shazia –and Sarah Henley (co-founder of NextUp Comedy standup streaming service), the story is inspired by Chalabi’s own experiences growing up in Wigan in an Egyptian-British family. Events may be rooted in reality (Muslim Ashraf’s insistence on Shazia wearing a scarf, for example), but they need to be crafted to achieve dramatic effect. Here, Shazia is in her late-20s at least, and living with white, British Chris; such tussles with her father hold no real threat to her independence, nor to their snippy, loving relationship. If the writing has yet to find its dramatic oomph, the production does its utmost to ignite the action. Helen Coyston’s ingenious design, based around four mobile chairs (as lit by Pablo Fernandez Baz), encourages the audience’s imagination to complete the picture. Sepy Baghaei’s direction gives full throttle to the actors’ talents, especially Haqjoo as muddling-through Ashraf; Hemi Yeroham as Shazia’s interfering, strictly observant brother; and Houda Echouafni and Helen Sheals deftly highlighting complementary traits in their contrasting roles as Ashraf’s new, Egyptian Muslim wife and Wigan-born first wife.

This entails hunkering down, waiting and hoping for a glimpse of the elusive snow leopard. For Tesson, the experience is profoundly spiritual, as evidenced by his highly ornamental narration: “Prehistory wept,” he says at one point, “and each tear was a yak.” While Tesson’s voiceover will not be for everyone, it’s impossible not to be moved by the cinematography, which captures the magnificent indifference of the natural world in triumphant widescreen – posturing stags, huffing steaming challenges at each other; surly bears eyeing their human stalkers; fat-faced Pallas’s cats terrorising small rodents.

5/1/2022,"What to wear to a party vexes the best of us, but when it’s the Met Gala, the high-profile fashion-world event at which celebrities compete to wear the most extravagant and lavish outfit, the style stakes are somewhat higher. Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez turned up at the annual ball in New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art last year in a dress emblazoned with “Tax the Rich”. The effect of her provocation, disparaged as too jarring for such a glittering display, may still be felt at the fundraiser on Monday hosted by Vogue’s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour. Guests have been asked to “embody the grandeur – and perhaps the dichotomy – of gilded age New York” and directed to Edith Wharton’s The Age of Innocence: “Everything about her shimmered and glimmered softly, as if her dress had been woven out of candle-beams, and she carried her head high, like a pretty woman challenging a roomful of rivals.” But it’s likely that the politically or sartorially astute will avoid ostentatious displays of wealth. For every family that lived like the Astors, thousands “sent their nine-year-olds off to factories from squalid tenements”, the New York Times said on Friday. Which to chose? Katy Perry says she’s not coming back as a chandelier or a hamburger. Designer Tom Ford has lamented the party’s drift towards fancy dress. Showing off the skill of les petites mains (little hands), the craftspeople who execute couture designs, might be more appropriate. The New York fashion business is debating employees’ demands for union recognition and better pay and conditions. Vogue publisher Condé Nast has been sent a letter from 350 staff asking it to recognise their union, protesting that “prestige doesn’t pay the bills”. The company said it planned “to have productive and thoughtful conversations with [staff].” A bill that seeks to create “financial transparency and accountability at management companies that represent models and creative artists in New York” is meanwhile working its way through the state’s legislature, backed by the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Karen Elson, Mancunian model and rock wife turned labour activist with The Model Alliance, said recently: “The biggest misconception about modelling is the money. Most working models are barely getting by.” The group plans to protest in New York on Sunday. And on Monday comes the publication of Anna, a biography of Wintour by former New York magazine writer Amy Odell. Odell, who spent more than three years on the book, said: “It was an opportunity to talk about her power, how she became so powerful, and how she held on to her power. She’ll have been at Vogue 34 years this summer and that’s wild, especially in media. For someone so public, she’s really a mysterious figure whose been the subject of so much gossip.” In 2020 the now 72-year-old editor was elevated by the corporation to become, in effect, queen of all Vogues and glossy titles bar the New Yorker. “She’s an intimidating figure, that’s no secret, but that’s what makes her so intriguing,” said Odell. But the force field around her, Odell learned, was largely a function of her retinue. Wintour is known for acts of kindness – delivering fashion editor Isabella Blow the largest bottle of Fracas perfume anyone had seen when she was unwell, for instance – but her reputed likes and dislikes (no black to be worn in the office) may actually have passed down as lore from generation to generation of assistants without anyone knowing if it is even true. Odell said: “There’s a lot of that around Anna, and I want people to come away from the book asking ‘why is she powerful?’ Is it just a contract?” In the book, New York designer Aurora James, who dressed Ocasio-Cortez, said plenty of designers had succeeded without Wintour’s support, just as plenty have failed with it. “What is this power, and could we all just opt out of it?” Odell asks. The answer, of course, may come down to clothes. Relatively few are worth photographing, and competition for them is, as Odell writes, fierce. Senior editors hoard them, creating the atmosphere, says fashion editor Grace Coddington in the book, of “a girls’ boarding school – with its sulky outbursts, tears and schoolgirlish tantrums”. Or as the late fashion writer André Leon Talley tactfully put it, Anna “surrounded herself with strong independent thinkers which could sometimes lead to differences of opinion”. In that environment, a bright cloak of mythology is an essential part of the psychic wardrobe. “Anna was kind of cool, could cut through the bullshit, make a decision and then they’d listen to her,” said Odell. “She somehow had the right personality for that job and managing that process.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,"Anna Wintour is still queen of fashion, but glitz won’t reign at her Met gala",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/01/anna-wintour-is-still-queen-of-fashion-but-glitz-wont-reign-at-her-met-gala
