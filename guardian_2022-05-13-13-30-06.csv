5/13/2022,"The elusive former education minister, Alan Tudge, has emerged on WeChat in an interview with a Chinese community leader where he responds generally to questions which include what to do about “toxic gender ideology” infiltrating schools. Tudge has been largely invisible during the campaign after he stood down from his ministry in December over claims by former staffer Rachelle Miller that she was involved in consensual sexual relationship with Tudge which turned abusive, in one alleged instance, physically. Tudge has denied the allegations of abuse. An internal inquiry by a respected former public servant, Vivienne Thom, found Tudge had not breached ministerial standards, but a separate workplace lawsuit by Miller related to her time working in the offices of Tudge, and later Michaelia Cash, is still on foot and could result in a reported $500,000 in compensation. Tudge has said he has not been made aware of the reported payment and does not know what it relates to. The three minute interview began circulating on a WeChat offical account, AU Life Life, on Thursday and has so far had 347 views. The account is run by one of Gladys Liu’s volunteers and has been shared among a volunteer group associated with treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s campaign. AULife Record has been sharing other Liberal party material, including reports by Liberal supporters of Alan Tudge’s campaign posters being vandalised. Tudge’s video interview appears designed to appeal to conservative Chinese voters, who make up 12% of the population in Kooyong (where Frydenberg is facing a challenge from an independent) and nearly 20% in Chisholm, the Liberals’ most marginal seat. In the video, a Chinese man identified only as Marcus said young families are concerned about slipping Naplan standards, a growth in “hate culture,” and “some toxic gender ideology entering the system”. He asked what families can do to guard against “woke” culture and protect the education system. Tudge replied: “One would be to keep close eyes on what your kids are being taught, and if you have concerns, raise them.” “The second thing would be to choose your schools carefully, different schools have different values which are imparted and it should reflect the values that you hold in your family. “And perhaps thirdly, I would say, think carefully who you will vote for. Certain political parties like, my political party, the Liberal party, you know what my views are as the education minister. “Understand the views of other political parties too, because they are not always the same. We want higher standards in Liberal party. We do want positive, optimistic views of Australia implanted in our kids, and we want good mainstream values being implanted as well. That’s what we stand for, so think about that too.” The caption on the video in Chinese makes reference to former prime minister Tony Abbott’s recent glowing endorsements of Tudge “as the best education minister we have ever had”. “He is a one of small number of courageous MPs who dare to point out to the education department the decline of Australian education standards and who defend Australia’s glorious history of development and the Judeo-Christian cultural values ​​that underpin its success,” the caption said. The video does not carry any party authorisation.",News/Australia news,Alan Tudge responds to questions about ‘toxic gender ideology’ in WeChat interview,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/13/alan-tudge-responds-to-questions-about-toxic-gender-ideology-in-wechat-interview
5/13/2022,"The aim was to be the invisible man, says Igor Pedin, 61. It was to drift, as if a ghost, with his small trolley bag of supplies and dog Zhu-Zhu, a nine-year-old mongrel terrier, through the hellscape of the besieged port city of Mariupol, out into the badlands of Russian-occupied territories and on to the relative safety of the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia – a mere 225km walk away. The equivalent of walking by foot from London to Sheffield but through a war unseen in its scale in Europe since 1945 and towards the oncoming convoys of tanks, armoured vehicles and nervous trigger-happy Russian soldiers racing towards Mariupol; it meant sidestepping mines and crossing destroyed bridges with his dog and luggage, where an erring step would lead to a 30ft drop to certain death; he would have to pass the smouldering homes and weeping men and women with their heartbreaking stories of death and suffering and their loss of will to live on. Pedin, a former ship’s cook, could not have known any of this – and he did not prove to be invisible, he concedes, as he recounts his tale in the safety of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Indeed, such would be his extraordinary feat that on one remarkable night Russian soldiers at one of the many checkpoints he would pass through gathered in the quiet of the evening to hear his story, stuffing cigarettes into his pockets for the onward journey and wishing him luck. He may not have been invisible, Pedin repeats, the tears welling in a rare moment of emotion. But he was, he adds, lucky. Pedin’s final decision to leave Mariupol was made on 20 April, he recalls, when the Russian soldiers had reached his part of the city and were going house to house, shooting at will. There was already little left to stay for; there was scant food or water, the dead were piling up in the streets. Pedin prepared meticulously. He packed a bag, weighed it and challenged himself to reduce the initial 70-kilo weight to 50. The initial task for Pedin and Zhu-Zhu was to traverse the five kilometres to the city outskirts, an aim that he had little faith could be achieved. He left his home on Tkochenko-Petrenko street near Mariupol’s port at 6am on 23 April and it took two hours to stumble through the craters, twisted steel and unexploded ordnance, north up Kyprino Street, where dead bodies were strewn, and on to the Port City shopping mall. Russian soldiers were handing out food and water at the end of long queues of desperate ashen-faced people. He stole by the crowds, avoiding eye contact with the soldiers, and walked up Zaporizhzhia Road. “I looked like a vagabond to them, I was nothing. I was dirty and covered from dust, as my house had been filled with a fog of smoke. I walked out of the city by this motorway and at the top I turned around. I looked back down at the city and I said to myself, it was the right decision. I said goodbye. There was an explosion. I turned and walked on.” He walked by burnt-out military vehicles, just his dog and the noise of shelling behind him until a convoy of armoured vehicles, so heavy they made the asphalt under his feet tremble, swept past. He crouched down, taking Zhu-Zhu, terrified, into his coat, until they passed. “I was an invisible man then,” he recalls. “What am I to them: who is this shadow?” His aim was the town of Nikolske, 20km away. By the time he reached the first houses, it was getting dark and very cold. “I saw a man ahead outside his house. He said, ‘Young man would you like to drink with me. Today I buried my son. Let’s drink to my son.’” Pedin gave up drinking 15 years ago but he could not refuse. He had two shots of vodka, while his new friend emptied the bottle. “He told me that Russians had killed his 16-year-old son on 3 March in Mariupol. Shrapnel had taken off his head. After he had disappeared he spent weeks looking for him in Mariupol. He found the grave, and Russian soldiers said he would have to dig him up with his hands if he wanted the body. He told me, ‘I want to die – I will kill myself.’” Pedin slept on the couch that night, waking at 6am. He knew the only way out towards Zaporizhzhia was through the town. “As I left the town there was a checkpoint: Chechens. They had seen me and two of them came towards me. ‘Where are you going? Where have you come from,’ they asked. ‘Have you been through the filtration camp.’” A commander appeared and called someone on a radio. “A minivan turned up and three big men came out and I was put in the van. We drove 2km back to Nikolske and came to a two-storey council building, which they had surrounded with steel fencing. There were about 40 people waiting in the grounds but the van drove to the building entrance.” Pedin left his bag outside and tied up Zhu-Zhu before being taken to the second floor. “A Russian officer sat in front of a desk asked me where I was going. I lied. I said I had a stomach ulcer and needed to get to Zaporizhzhia as I had paid for treatment. I was told to take off my top and they looked for tattoos. I had a bruise on my shoulder and they accused me of having had a rifle. He demanded, ‘where are your tattoos?’ He said, ‘You are boring me. Maybe I should beat you?’ I said, ‘As you wish, commander.’ But I was taken to another room where there were four military women with PCs, and they scanned my fingerprints, put me up against a wall and took mugshots.” He was given a document from the so-called ministry of internal affairs of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. He was free to leave and set off again with his dog and bag to the checkpoint. “The Chechens said they would get the next car to take me to the next village at Rozivka. I was there for two hours. They were bored and talked to me, giving me cigarettes. None of the drivers would take me, so I said, guys, I will just walk. One said, ‘No, this is my authority’, pointing at his gun.” After an hour, a black minivan pulled up and the Chechens demanded that the driver, who was travelling with his wife and two daughters, aged about 18 and 20, take Pedin. “No one said a word. They took me to Rozivka. On the way, I noticed in the fields large diggers digging up holes. And further down there were crosses. I am sure they were mass graves.” On arrival at Rozivka, Pedin walked down Lenina street out of town and came to another checkpoint which he passed easily with his new document and kept on walking. By the time he came to the next village, Verzhyna, it was pitch black. “Suddenly flashlights blinded me. There were six soldiers, they barked at me, I put up my hands. They told me to take my top off, emptied my bag. It was freezing. They ordered me to follow them. We went inside the House of Culture [a community centre] which was their headquarters.” Pedin was given some canned beef and some soup and put in a small room that had a steel bed in the corner. He was told that if he left earlier than the morning that he would be shot – but was free to go the following day. He crept past the sleeping soldiers in the morning and nodded to one on watch as he left. He walked for 14 hours that day reaching another checkpoint at around 8pm to be searched again. The soldiers pointed him towards a small abandoned house where he could sleep. But he was off again at 6am as the sun rose. “I saw a big man in his 60s. He asked, ‘Where are you from?’ I said Mariupol, and he called to his wife to bring food. They gave me a bag of bread, onion, fried pork, cucumber. They insisted. And I walked on.” By now, Pedin was exhausted and yet the greatest obstacle was to come. The road bridge he needed to pass over had been destroyed, leaving a 30-metre sheer drop on to railway tracks below. “You can cheat people but not a destroyed bridge.” The bridge’s metal frame was still in place, however, with two beams: one narrow one below and one broader one at shoulder height. Pedin tied up his dog with his bag and tested the crossing. It was doable. He went back and crossed again with his bag. Then he returned and took his dog, who walked on the beam above, with Pedin holding the lead. “I just shouted, ‘We did it.’” They approached the next checkpoint. The soldier demanded to know where my companion was. “I said I only had my dog. Then they wanted to know how I had crossed the bridge.” Pedin was told he could stay the night in the back half of a radio van that had been hit by a Ukrainian shell at the front. It was dark now. Pedin’s story was exactly the sort of diversion the bored soldiers needed. Five gathered around him, to hear of his adventures, and daring deeds across the bridge. “One wanted to keep in touch, he was saying that after the war I should stay with him. There was nothing for me to say.” Pedin slept in his chair, with Zhu-Zhu under his coat. The next morning, he was told he was not allowed to carry on via the road to Zaporizhzhia but had to choose to go back or south to the city of Tokmak. Pedin headed towards the city but faced two big hills. “The dog just couldn’t go on. I had to walk up the road with my bag, and then come back for him and carry him up. I said, ‘If you don’t walk we will both die, you have to walk.’ He walked up the next hill.” Off the road was Tarasivka, a small village. “I saw the top of the head of a man in a window and called to him. I gave him some of the soldiers’ cigarettes, I even had menthol cigarettes. The only way to Zaporizhzhia was on small roads and over a dam and then to take what he said was the smugglers’ track.” He did as he was instructed. But after the dam, there was a crossroads – and no indication of which way to go. Pedin’s luck struck again. “A truck appeared. I called out. I said, ‘I am from Mariupol.’ The door opened. We drove for two hours, through weaving roads. I would have never have found my way. We said nothing. At the checkpoints, this man said just two words to the Donetsk People’s Republic militia and he was let through.” Pedin saw a Ukrainian flag ahead, where soldiers checked the men’s documents and let them go. “The driver dropped me in central Zaporizhzhia by a tent. He had said nothing on the journey but gave me 1,000 hryvnia (£30). He said good luck. He understood everything – what was there to say?” Pedin walked into the tent, full of volunteers. He was asked by a woman whether he needed help. He went quiet and then said yes. “The lady asked, ‘where have you come from?’ I said, ‘I have come from Mariupol.’ She screamed: ‘Mariupol!’” Pedin recalls with a smile. “She shouted out to everyone, this man has come from Mariupol on foot. Everyone stopped. I suppose it was my moment of glory.”",News/World news,The invisible Ukrainian who walked 225km to safety from Mariupol,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/13/the-invisible-ukrainian-who-walked-225km-to-safety-from-mariupol
5/13/2022,"In the days after Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine in late February, Vladimir Shurupov, a cardiologist from the Siberian city of Tomsk, felt he could not breathe properly. “I was having panic attacks, I could not eat or sleep. I just knew I had to remove myself from this place, from this atmosphere,” he said. Shurupov, 40, had been a quiet critic of Putin’s government for years, but he had never attended a protest of any kind, fearful of unwanted attention or arrest. When the war began, disgust with the regime combined with a fear he would be sent to the front. “If there was mobilisation, I would have been called up as a military doctor, and this is not a war I would be willing to fight in,” he said. Shurupov discussed with his wife and two sons that perhaps they should try to leave the country. The family had minimal savings but he was able to sell his car for cash and buy four tickets to Yerevan, the capital of Armenia. Just two days after first discussing leaving, they flew out of Tomsk to Yerevan. After receiving Schengen visas, they moved on to Bulgaria. They have no plans ever to return home. The Shurupov family are among hundreds of thousands of Russians to have fled the country since the war began on 24 February. Putin has referred to such people as “traitors and scum” and said their departure will help “cleanse” Russian society. Many are opposition journalists or activists, whose work has in effect been criminalised under increasingly draconian wartime laws in Russia. Others are businesspeople fleeing sanctions. Some simply did not want to be part of a society where pro-war feelings are running so high. Shurupov estimated that of 30 colleagues at his hospital, only three were opposed to the war. Some of those who left in the days after the invasion have already decided to return, but many are set on making a new life abroad, at least until there are political changes in Russia. “I don’t want to live behind a new iron curtain. I just had a feeling that there was no future in Russia,” said Valery Zolotukhin, 39, a literary and theatre scholar who came to Armenia with his wife and seven-year-old daughter. “In Russia, you’re living inside the fantasy of a few people … They’ve created an imaginary world and you’re forced to be part of it.” A century ago, after the Bolsheviks took over Russia, millions of émigrés fled to Istanbul, Prague and Harbin. Today there is an echo of that process as the cafes of Vilnius, Tbilisi and Yerevan are packed with Russians in the first stages of building a new life. Armenia is one of the most popular destinations, because no visa is required. It has also created favourable conditions for IT businesses, prompting the relocation of thousands of Russian tech professionals over the past two months. “At the beginning, you walked down the street and saw all your friends from Moscow, and the people from St Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod you only normally see on Zoom calls,” said Maya Gorodova, a former commercial director at Russian startups, who has set up a coworking space in Yerevan with views to Mount Ararat from the windows. All 70 current tenants are recent arrivals from Russia, and Gorodova has received calls from Russians in Belgrade, Tbilisi, Tel Aviv and Bali, she said, asking for advice on setting up new work spaces for émigrés. The outflow of tech professionals is likely to be a huge blow for Russia, which in recent years has become a highly digitised economy. But opposition to the war, a fear of possible mobilisation and the loss of contracts with foreign clients due to sanctions have combined to push many to the exit. At Hummus Kimchi, a new restaurant run by a brother and sister team transplanted from Moscow, recent arrivals to Yerevan discuss their next moves. Some have their eye on Britain’s Global Talent visa and have paid thousands of pounds to agents who promise to craft their forms to match the Home Office’s checklist. Others note that Germany offers citizenship within five years for arriving IT specialists. “Of course these are all reserve options,” said one young tech professional, sipping a craft beer. “Hopefully, Putin will die soon and we can all go back.” For many who have left, emigration was the final moment in a life of gritty opposition activity, including arrests and house searches. For others it was the start of a political awakening. One woman in her 30s, who did not want her name published, said she had always opposed Putin but had been too fearful to attend protests or post on Facebook. On the second day of the war she wore clothes in Ukrainian colours to work, and her colleagues began insulting her. She realised nobody in her social group shared her revulsion over the invasion. “It’s impossible to talk to any of my friends, I started chats with a few of them and it feels like they are just pressing control C, control V. They’re all repeating the same phrases,” she said. She also left behind a long-term boyfriend who works in Russia’s security services. Previously they had not discussed politics much, but before departing she wrote him a long letter setting out her opposition to the war. They have hardly spoken since. “In a short time here I met more people who think like me than I did in the last few years in Moscow. And I realised that here I’ve stopped always calculating what I should say based on who I’m talking to. I feel so much freer,” she said. Many Russians in Yerevan spend long hours in the city’s cafes and bars, philosophising about whether there was any way to have stopped Putin earlier, and whether they should have done more. Some remain worried about repercussions at home and speak in mealy mouthed euphemisms about “the unfortunate events” or “the Ukrainian situation”. Others are eager to express their wholehearted support for Ukraine. In Moscow, Elena Kamay ran Lambada Markets, which put on street markets beloved by the city’s so-called “creative class” that has sprung up over the past decade. Stalls sold vintage clothing, items by local designers and other artisan objects. “Of course it was all a facade, we lived in a bubble. And now it’s all over,” she said. Kamay moved to Yerevan at the beginning of March, and like many has been thinking back over the past decade from today’s vantage point. She accepted that working in Moscow had involved “doing a deal with your conscience”, though she said she had been attending anti-government protests since 2011. Recently, she said, she had been rereading messages she had exchanged with Oksana Baulina, a Russian activist and journalist who left Russia two years ago and was killed by a Russian airstrike in Kyiv in March while reporting. “I always thought she was exaggerating a bit when she described her views about Russia and the political system, but it turns out she was right all along,” she said. Elena Chegodayeva also arrived in Yerevan in March, and a few weeks later set up a school from an apartment in the city centre. The 50 pupils and 20 teachers have all recently arrived from Russia. Chegodayeva said she had been pondering the concept of collective responsibility since the war started. “We are all Russians and we will have to take responsibility for this, just like Germans had to after the war,” she said. “On the other hand, I was two years old when Putin was elected, so it’s not entirely clear what more I could have done.” Chegodayeva, 24, said she had lost part of her university stipend for arguing with her professor about whether the annexation of Crimea was illegal, and received dawn visits to her apartment from police after taking part in protests. She said the case of a St Petersburg artist who faces 10 years in jail for replacing supermarket price tags with anti-war slogans showed protest in Russia now was futile. She will only return to Russia “if there is revolution in the air”, she said. Rather than try to persuade people to stay, Putin has celebrated the outflow of hundreds of thousands of educated, anti-war Russians. In a sinister video address in the middle of March, Putin criticised those who moved abroad or supported the west in its current battle with Moscow. “Any people, and particularly the Russian people, are able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors, and simply spit them out like a fly that flew into their mouths,” he said, using some of the harshest language of his two decades in charge. There would be a “natural and necessary cleansing of society”, said Putin, which would be beneficial to the country in the long run. The question now is whether those who have left will gradually disconnect themselves from Russia, or form a powerful opposition to Putin and his regime from outside, rallying around political forces such as associates of the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who are mostly now based in Vilnius. “For 100 years, the understanding of emigration was that people quickly lost touch with Russia and didn’t understand it, so nobody believed the political emigration might have a chance of playing a role in Russian politics,” said Andrei Soldatov, a co-author with Irina Borogan of a recent book about the history of Russians outside Russia. Now, however, the internet opens up very different possibilities. “The country is still connected to the world. So many Russian journalists left the country and still have contact with their audiences, and this is an absolutely new development for the Kremlin,” Soldatov said. Before trying to change the regime, many of the émigrés are first focused on trying to change the mind of war-supporting family members who have stayed behind, refusing to leave. Shurupov hopes his mother will eventually join the family in Europe, but so far she is resisting. “I haven’t been able to convince her about the war, and she doesn’t want to leave. For me, this is a real tragedy.”",News/World news,Russian émigrés fleeing Putin’s war find freedom in the cafes of Armenia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/13/russia-emigres-putin-war-ukraine-armenia
5/13/2022,"If you want to know how much Scott Morrison wants to win this election campaign, I recommend you watch the footage from Friday’s press conference. Morrison wants to win enough to execute a humility flip. The Liberal campaign has been struggling with its Morrison problem right from the get go. The prime minister is largely a positive for the Coalition in the regions and outer suburbs, but in the Liberal party’s disillusioned progressive heartland, Morrison is seen as irredeemably toxic. The campaign’s first response to this problem has been Operation Permission To Distance. Liberals in marginal seats have been actively differentiating themselves from Morrison for weeks; even the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, close enough to the prime minister to bunk in with him at the Lodge, now puts his differences with Morrison on high rotation. But evidently, that’s not enough. Morrison now has to distance from Morrison. He’s created Morrison 2.0. The prime minister’s messaging on Friday tells us he understands he’s a barrier to entry for many voters, including people who have voted Liberal all their lives. So Morrison 2.0 – birthed at a press conference – gets things wrong, but he also learns from his mistakes and strives to do better. Morrison 2.0 has a positive agenda for the country and a belief that things will be better now we are out of the pandemic that we aren’t actually out of. Morrison 2.0 has happy, productive thoughts, ideas and plans as well as an insatiable hunger to list Anthony “loose unit” Albanese’s character deficiencies several times a day down to the footnotes, in an effort to spare Australians from the miserable fate that apparently awaits them under Labor. Morrison 2.0 even revealed that the beta version – that would be the prime minister we’ve all seen in a variety of contexts over the last four and a bit years, the person with very clear and seemingly fixed character traits – was “a bit of a bulldozer”. (Guys. Can you believe it? Who knew?) Most tellingly of all, Morrison 2.0 acknowledged that beta Morrison had to change. “As we go into this next period on the other side of this election, I know there are things that are going to have to change with the way I do things,” he said. “We are moving into a different time. We are moving into a time of opportunity and working from the strong platform of strength that we’ve built and saved in our economy in the last three years we can now take advantage of those opportunities in the future.” Extraordinary is an overused word in political commentary, but it truly was extraordinary to see this person, the person who declared shortly after taking the prime ministership that like General Norman Schwarzkopf, when placed in command, he would “take charge” – suddenly unleash an entirely new prime ministerial character. One that could brook criticism without sulking. One who could sometimes be wrong. One prepared to listen. One prepared to learn. I say on behalf of the women of Australia – where was this prime minister, the humble and empathic leader the country needed during the cultural reckoning of the past 12 months? I say to Morrison directly: where were you when you were needed (as opposed to when you needed to win an election)? Seriously, how dare you. If Morrison could learn (as opposed, to managing, strategising, spinning and fixing) – if this was actually an option, why has he spent the past four years point blank refusing to do so? Morrison’s stubborn refusal to read the room and be different is the main reason he’s in political trouble now, because Australians can easily recognise forceful characters who always know best, the people who are righteous in their obduracy, people imagine themselves saviours when they are human, and therefore flawed. Let’s consider why Morrison is pulling his own version of “real Julia” (Gillard’s attempted campaign flip in 2010). The reason is simple. Morrison has a strategy to win, but he doesn’t know whether his strategy is going to work. He’s uncertain. I can see this sensation he’s battling because it’s brand new, I’ve never seen him battle it before. It’s doubt. Morrison’s imperative during the final week of the 2022 campaign is hold the base and firm up the soft vote. Morrison has shored up Clive Palmer’s preferences in the seats that matter and given the swinging Liberals who might vote Labor, independent or insurgent, a list of reasons not to do that. He’s landed some blows on Albanese during the campaign as he’s sought to weight his gravity-defying opponent as a risk. But the torrent of the ad hominem and negativity has obscured the Coalition’s positive messages to the point where swinging voters are wondering whether this government has anything at all to say about the future. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In this final week, Morrison must now communicate with the people he’s persuaded to hesitate. Unfortunately for him, some of these voters loathe him. His first pitch to this group was: I know you don’t like me but you know I’m good at my job. Unfortunately for him, they don’t know that. So now Morrison has to be better at his job, which is what he told this cohort on Friday. He laced his mea culpa with hope and aspiration and an overlay of Labor’s campaign messaging, hoping for a convergence, hoping for his May miracle. He might still get it. If anyone can get it, this bloke can, because his political ruthlessness knows no bounds. He is a narrowcaster par excellence. But the Coalition is in trouble. Friday’s Morrison 2.0 mea culpa isn’t the dawn of self-knowledge. It’s a clarion distress call.",News/Australia news,Even Scott Morrison is trying to distance himself from Scott Morrison now | Katharine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/13/even-scott-morrison-is-trying-to-distance-himself-from-scott-morrison-now
