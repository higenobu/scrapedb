2/5/2022,"It’s behavior you wouldn’t traditionally associate with a funeral: Two grieving siblings, 21-year-old Trinity Wright and her 12-year-old sister, rapping Soulja Boy’s “Rick & Morty” in front of their mother’s open casket for a TikTok video. “Day one of singing ‘Rick & Morty’ to our mom until she comes back from the d3@d,” the onscreen caption on the video, which has racked up over 16.6 million views, reads. The strange ritual the girls are partaking in stems from a 2021 trend that saw TikTokers filming themselves rapping the same Soulja Boy song in front of the gravestones of famous historical figures, celebrities, friends and family members. People’s intent for doing so varies, with some users seeking to bring people back from the dead and others seeking to disturb their eternal rest. Still, despite Trinity’s video being part of a greater trend, viewers seemed to think that the funeral home setting caused her video to cross a line. “If this is real, it’s really inappropriate. I hope this whole thing is a joke,” one user wrote, with another adding, “This is wrong – really wrong.” Others defended the girls’ right to grieve in whichever manner best helped them process their trauma. “Everyone mourns differently. Jokes were the best way to cope for me, and I think they would know their mom better than all of you guys,” wrote one user. After Trinity sparked backlash with her video, she spoke out in her own defense, calling the experience “therapeutic” and saying that filming the TikTok provided the grieving siblings a moment of humor amid a notably difficult time. Still, the video seems to have reignited an ongoing debate about grief on social media, including what is and isn’t healthy or appropriate to share online. Videos of people expressing grief have become a mainstay on TikTok, with over 1.9 billion views on TikTok’s #grief page alone. A quick scroll of the hashtag reveals videos across the entire spectrum of grief, from people openly sobbing over their breakups on camera, to teens, like the Wright sisters, rapping in front of their loved one’s caskets, to borderline cinematic montages of people who have passed. These videos often get two types of comments: Those offering to share in the original poster’s heartbreak and thanking them for being so open about their raw emotions, and those condemning them for posting “inappropriately” and accusing them of exploiting their loved one’s death for clout. When it comes to the true motives behind sharing grief online, Dr. Mimi Winsberg, MD, chief medical officer at Brightside, told In The Know that it likely boils down to the desire to connect with others during times of great distress. “There is comfort in sharing the loss with others, which is why every culture and society has developed rituals around grief and death, and these have been practiced since the dawn of time,” she explained. “Death rituals in the form of funerals, memorials or other gatherings help mourners process the loss and transition into a new life without their loved one.” Dr. Winsberg, a psychiatrist with over 25 years of clinical experience, noted that the recent increase in “crying selfies” and similar grief content on social media could be a reflection of the fact that the pandemic has brought both an increased death rate and a decreased ability to congregate, therefore robbing us of the chance to grieve collectively. According to a GoFundMe for the Wright family, Trinity’s mother, Michelle Wright, died of COVID-19 complications in September 2021, which would put the family in the category of isolated grieving. “In modern life, without traditional venues for grieving — religious institutions, extended families, villages — and pandemic-induced isolation, perhaps social media is a convenient or compelling outlet,” Dr. Winsberg explained. This, combined with the fact that we now live in a time when social media is a main mode of communication regarding just about everything else, created the perfect storm for displays of grief to become popular online. Although crying selfies and funeral rapping videos may seem strange to the older population, these open displays of grief have become highly accepted by Gen Z, a generation known for how deeply it values authenticity over polished and perfect content. As Dr. Winsberg explains, different cultures and different generations have been developing unique ways of grieving that suit them and their circumstances since the dawn of civilization. And just because one tradition looks strange or even inappropriate to a member of a different group, it doesn’t mean it’s morally bad or incorrect. “I remember, in my 20s, attending a funeral in a small village in Greece where all the women wailed at the top of their lungs in dramatic displays of emotion,” she recalled. “While this felt foreign to me, it was a culturally sanctioned way to express grief. I think each person or group needs to decide what feels appropriate and therapeutic for them.” As long as a practice does not harm anyone — including the poster — Dr. Winsberg says that displaying grief on social media can more or less be considered a healthy practice. Of course, those who share this content must ensure they keep in line with each social platform’s outlined terms and conditions. “Grief and loss are processed individually, and each person may find their own ways and timeline to grieve a loss,” she explained. “It is, of course, up to the social media companies themselves to set their own community guidelines and standards.” The next time you happen upon a video of someone sobbing directly into the camera, consider that instead of “begging for views,” they might just be in desperate search of human connection and a community in which to process their grief. And rather than accusing them of chasing clout, perhaps you — yes, you — can be their virtual shoulder to cry on. In The Know has reached out to Trinity Wright for comment.

2/5/2022,"SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korean politicians and activists criticised what they called China's ""cultural appropriation"", after a woman appearing to be wearing Korean traditional dress appeared among those representing China's different ethnic groups during the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Games on Friday. China is home to around two million ethnic Koreans, half of whom live on the Chinese side of the North Korean border, and they are a recognised minority group whose language and culture are granted official protection. South Koreans have expressed ire in the past over recent Chinese claims that some aspects of Korean culture such as kimchi, a Korean side dish made with fermented cabbage, or traditional Korean dress called hanbok, are of Chinese origin. ""We deeply regret that hanbok appeared among the costumes of Chinese minorities at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics,"" wrote ruling party lawmaker Lee So-young in her Facebook page on Saturday, referring to a woman dressed in a white top and pink dress among people that passed the Chinese flag during the ceremony. ""This is not the first time China has introduced Korean culture as if it were its own... If the anti-China sentiment of the Korean people becomes stronger by leaving this issue as is, it will be a big obstacle when conducting diplomacy with China in the future,"" Lee said. Lee Jae-myung, the ruling Democratic Party of Korea candidate for the country's presidential election in March, wrote in his Facebook page late on Friday, ""Do not covet (our) culture. Oppose cultural appropriation"". The main opposition People Power Party (PPP) called the costume's appearance a ""rude"" act of appropriating the culture of a sovereign state, which overshadows the Games' slogan of ""together for a shared future"". ""We cannot remain angry, but make the world more aware of the truth that hanbok is a traditional Korean costume,"" Seo Kyoung-duk, a professor at Sungshin Women's University and activist promoting South Korean culture, wrote in his Instagram account. Although the South Korean government has not expressed an official statement, Culture Minister Hwang Hee told South Korean media on Saturday that referring to people as a minority means it hasn't become a sovereign country, which could cause ""misunderstanding"" in bilateral relations, according to Yonhap.
