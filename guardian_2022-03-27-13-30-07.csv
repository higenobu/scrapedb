3/27/2022,"North Korea may be making rapid preparations to carry out a nuclear weapons test for the first time in more than four years, according to a South Korean media report. The Yonhap news agency, quoting government sources, said North Korea appeared to be digging a “shortcut” to Tunnel 3 at its previously closed nuclear test site in Punggye-ri. Analysts at the Centre for Non-Proliferation Studies (CNS) had said at the beginning of March that satellite images showed signs of rebuilding at the site, but that getting it back up and running could take months or years. Now, Kim Jong-un’s regime may have changed tack. “[The North] abruptly stopped its initial construction work to restore the entrance to Tunnel 3, and it is digging up the side [of the tunnel],” Yonhap quoted a source as saying. “In this way, it seems like it will be possible to restore [the facilities] in a month.” Punggye-ri is North Korea’s only known nuclear test site. It conducted six nuclear weapons tests in tunnels at the site from 2006 to 2017. North Korea’s last and largest nuclear test appeared to trigger geological instability that caused multiple small earthquakes, but analysts and US intelligence officials have said the site could probably be used again. The development comes a few days after North Korea broke a UN ban and fired an intercontinental ballistic missile. Japan and South Korea said it travelled 1,080km (670 miles), reaching a maximum altitude of more than 6,200km, coming down 90 miles west of the Oshima peninsula on Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost main island. The missile, dubbed the Hwasong-17, was the largest liquid-fuelled missile ever launched from a road-mobile launcher, analysts said. It was the first time since 2017 that North Korea had tested an ICBM and represented a significant step in Pyongyang’s development of weapons that might be able to strike targets in the US. Kim ordered the test because of the “daily escalating military tension in and around the Korean peninsula” and the “inevitability of the longstanding confrontation with the US imperialists accompanied by the danger of a nuclear war”, the state-run KCNA news agency said at the time. North Korea tested a record number of missiles in January and also appears to be preparing to launch a spy satellite. Images captured by satellite early in March showed very early signs of activity at the Punggye-ri site, including construction and repairs, specialists at the California-based CNS said in a report. “One possibility is that North Korea plans to bring the test site back to a state of readiness to resume nuclear explosive testing,” the report said. “How long it would take North Korea to resume explosive testing at the site depends on the extent of the damage to the tunnels themselves, something we do not know with confidence.” Punggye-ri has been closed since North Korea’s self-imposed moratorium on nuclear weapons tests in 2018. With denuclearisation talks stalled, however, Kim has said he no longer feels bound by that moratorium. In 2018 North Korea removed all observation facilities, research buildings and security posts beforing blowing up the tunnel entrances. A small contingent of foreign media observed the demolition, but North Korea refused to allow international inspectors, leading to speculation the facilities could be restored.",News/World news,North Korea may be preparing for nuclear test soon – report,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/27/north-korea-may-be-preparing-for-nuclear-test-soon-report
3/27/2022,"International nurses working for NHS trusts and private care homes are being trapped in their jobs by clauses in their contracts that require them to pay thousands of pounds if they try to leave. In extreme cases, nurses are tied to their roles for up to five years and face fees as steep as £14,000 if they want to change job or return home early. The Royal College of Nursing and human rights lawyers are calling for an urgent government review after an Observer investigation uncovered evidence of the clauses being used in both the NHS and private sector. Designed to retain staff and recoup recruitment costs, they often cover hiring expenses such as flights to the UK, visas and the fee for taking language and competency exams. In many cases, they also include the costs of mandatory training, which workers hired in the UK are not routinely required to pay. Nurses affected by the repayment terms, many of whom served on the frontline at the height of the pandemic, said they had been pushed into debt or locked into long-term payment agreements after leaving roles, even in cases of bullying or family emergencies. Others stay in jobs despite illness or poor working conditions as they fear they will be unable to repay, charities and unions said. Parosha Chandran, a barrister and UN expert on human trafficking who helped shape the UK’s modern slavery laws, likened the clauses to “debt bondage” and called for them to be reviewed at the highest level. “This gives rise to very serious concerns about exploitation,” she said.Patricia Marquis, director for England at the Royal College of Nursing, said she was “very concerned” by a practice which flourished “in a climate of chronic understaffing”. The RCN was aware of some employers using punitive clauses which could result in workers being forced to pay thousands of pounds. “We have also heard of cases in which employers try to frighten and intimidate staff with threats of deportation should they choose to work elsewhere,” Marquis said. The UK recruits heavily from overseas in an effort to plug a shortage of 40,000 nurses in the NHS alone, with most recruits coming from the Philippines and India. One contract seen by the Observer, used in an NHS hospital trust in the east of England, says international nurses must repay unspecified “costs related to [their] recruitment” if they leave within three years. Those leaving within 18 months must repay “100%” of the costs. Another, used by University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, includes a £5,000 repayment clause for candidates from the Philippines that halves after a year. The trust said the fees could include exam costs, flights, visas and accommodation, adding that retaining staff was vital to its operations. In the private sector, the fees can be steeper. One nurse from Zimbabwe was told to pay £10,850 when she tried to leave her job at a care home, according to Unison. She said it was obvious the charges had been exaggerated, “but the manager said she would not give me a reference unless I paid the full amount”. Susan Cueva, a trustee of the charity Kanlungan, which supports Filipino migrants, said: “They are taking advantage of these workers who have no clue about the rules in the UK,” she said. “They end up thinking, ‘I better sit tight, even though I’m suffering,’ because they can’t afford to pay it back.” She said it was unfair for employers to pass recruitment costs on to workers, when hiring internationally can save them huge sums. It costs between £10,000 and £12,000 to recruit an overseas nurse, but employers can save £18,500 in agency nurse costs in the first year alone, according to one estimate. By comparison, it takes three years to train a nurse in the UK and costs about £50,000 to £70,000. The government does not pay tuition fees, but provides maintenance grants of £5,000 a year. Stuart Tuckwood, nursing officer at Unison, said the union knew of cases where nurses were “trapped by unethical contracts” – including a case where a nurse was required to pay £14,000 despite her salary being just £16,000. He said: “The government must protect and support these nurses. That means having safeguards that can be properly enforced. Otherwise the UK may be breaking not only obligations to the individual nurses, but also the agreements signed with the nations they come from.” The Department of Health said it was aware of repayment clauses being used to recoup upfront costs where candidates do not meet the terms of their contract, but it would be “concerned if repayment costs were disproportionate or punitive”. A spokesperson said: “We are clear that overseas staff should not be charged fees for recruitment services when gaining employment in the UK. We are grateful to all those who have come from abroad to train, learn and work in our NHS and social care sector.”",News/Society,Overseas nurses in the UK forced to pay out thousands if they want to quit jobs,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/27/overseas-nurses-in-the-uk-forced-to-pay-out-thousands-if-they-want-to-quit-jobs
3/27/2022,"When Laura Sanchez was offered a job as a nurse in the NHS, it sounded like the opportunity of a lifetime. At home in the Philippines, she had seen Facebook ads similar to those on the site today, promising “an attractive relocation package” and inviting her to “Start your UK dream!” Bosses from an NHS trust in the south-east had even flown to the city near her village to interview candidates in person, desperate to fill empty posts on their wards. With eight years’ experience, she was a perfect fit. Hours after her interview she was offered a job. “I was very excited,” said the 34-year-old, whose name has been changed. “My friends in other trusts had beautiful jobs and were enjoying it.” At first, things went smoothly: the work was hard but she was saving enough money to send a small amount to her elderly parents, who had remortgaged their land to put her through nursing college. Then, in April 2020, everything changed. While working 12-hour shifts on a critical care ward at the height of the first lockdown, without full PPE or regular testing, Sanchez caught Covid. The virus left her fatigued and struggling for breath, but mentally it was even worse. She returned to the ward but found herself anxious and panicky to the point that she was signed off by her GP. “I kept on crying and crying. I was terrified of the number of deaths,” she said. “Some of the nurses who died in the NHS were my friends.” In September 2020, just under a year after she arrived, Sanchez made the difficult decision to go home. But when she broke the news to her manager, she was told it was not that simple. She had a two-year contract. To leave early would cost her £6,000. Sanchez is one of thousands of international nurses subject to repayment clauses in the UK. To help plug a critical national staffing shortage, with as many as 400 NHS workers leaving every week, the UK is recruiting a historically high number of nurses from overseas. In the 12 months to the end of September 2021, there were more than 7,000 arrivals from India and 5,000 from the Philippines, data from the Nursing and Midwifery Council suggest – part of more than 125,000 international nurses currently registered. There are plans to boost that number: the government has pledged to add 50,000 nurses for the NHS alone by 2025, with thousands more needed in social care. Aside from the exams and approvals they need to work in the UK, overseas nurses are ready to go. It costs employers about £10,000 to £12,000 per recruit up front – but saves them as much as £18,500 in agency fees in the first year alone. In some cases, trusts can be paid up to £7,000 by NHS England for each overseas nurse they recruit. Yet unlike their UK colleagues, those who leave before their contract ends can find themselves footing a hefty bill, an Observer investigation has found – even in cases of bullying, discrimination, ill health and family emergencies. The repayment clauses – which typically last three years and can cover everything from flights and visas to initial accommodation and training – are widespread in the NHS and private sector, although terms differ and not all employers use them. One that does, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, cited as an example of good practice in an NHS Employers’ recruitment toolkit, charges Filipino nurses £5,000 if they wish to leave in the first year, falling to £2,500 after a year. The trust says hiring a nurse from overseas costs about £11,000, “which may include language, theory and practical exams, flights, work visas and accommodation”, and that it uses two-year repayment clauses to “protect that investment”. Sharp BH Global, an agency that recruits in the Philippines for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, uses “contractual measures” to ensure “nurses honour their commitment” as part of its “Nurses Ready to Roll” programme. “This contractually binding agreement requires them to honour the full employment contracts otherwise they face financial penalties,” its website says. In the private sector, the fees are often higher. One care provider with more than 10 homes in the UK is charging migrant workers £7,000 if they try to leave their role within a year, falling to 50% of the “expenses” – £3,500 – if they leave at any point before three years. In a case identified by Unison, a nurse who was recruited from Zimbabwe in August 2020 to help with the Covid-19 response says she tried to leave after her employer refused to increase her annual salary from £15,000 to £16,000 following her probation period, as agreed. She had been offered a job at an NHS trust, but when she asked for a reference, the employer refused and told her she would have to pay £10,850. In the worst cases, workers can be locked into their jobs for five years and face charges of up to £14,000 if they try to leave early. In Sanchez’s case, she had signed an agreement before she started, but the amount – equal to about three months’ pay – had never been specified. With pressure from a union and charity, the trust eventually backed down – but not before saying that unless she paid she would not be able to work in the UK again. “To me, it’s not fair,” she said. “We work hard and I had been sick. I don’t think they should have been asking for any repayment after a year, especially when I got my illness while working at the trust.” While the clauses are not always enforced, they act as a powerful deterrent, said Susan Cueva of Kanlungan, a charity for Filipino migrants. Some workers stay put in spite of workplace or other issues, fearing that if they leave they will be unable to pay. She likened them to a form of bondage. “You can’t leave unless you pay, and if you leave you have to pay,” she said. “Lawyers would argue that they signed the contracts and therefore they’re bound by them. They’ll say, ‘They have a choice, they don’t have to sign it,’ ” she said. But in some cases, workers are shown different contracts from the ones they sign when they arrive, or are only shown the contract when they get to the UK. Others may not fully understand the implications of the repayment terms, because they plan to stay in the UK for good – or have already spent thousands saving to come in the first place. “To go back would mean losing all the money they’ve spent at their end trying to get the job. So they take their chances,” she said. Ads targeted at international candidates on Facebook paint a sunny picture of life in the UK. But on YouTube, dozens of nurses are speaking up about the harsher reality – from challenges involving bringing family members to live with them to visa problems and costs of living. There is a subgenre of videos dedicated to repayment clauses. “If you have that clause, start saving now in case you need to leave,” one vlogger advises. “It is your sanity. It is your life. It is your mental health,” another says. “What if you die there before you finish your three-year contract? If you’re not happy in your job?” she trails off. “I knew I had to leave.” One YouTuber, Becca Agyemang, a mother of three from Accra, Ghana, began working as an NHS nurse in the south-east in September 2020. She had paid about 40,000 cedis (roughly £4,000) for her studies. The costs of bringing her to the UK – her conversion exams, visa and flights – were paid by the trust. After a year, she wanted to leave her role not because of bullying or an emergency, but because she was struggling without a support network around her. She got an offer from another NHS trust in London, but for leaving before the three-year term was over, she was told she would have to repay recruitment costs of about £3,500. “It was OK because I had saved a bit at that time,” she said, but “it wasn’t easy. They took it from my salary. So you just have to sort yourself out, rent, accommodation.” But her situation is not as bad as that of some of her friends. “One of my friends was in a care home. She paid more than £5,000 after working more than three years. They still made her pay it all,” she said. Another nurse, from the Philippines, said she left her job at a care home after being “traumatised” while working there at the height of the pandemic, months after arriving in the UK. “I just didn’t expect it to be that difficult physically and mentally,” the nurse, now working for the NHS in the south-west, said. She had calculated the costs of her training and relocation to be about £3,000. But the care home said she owed £6,700. “I really wanted to transfer to a better way of living, even though it was very, very costly,” she said. “We’ve given them all our savings just to escape.” Unions, charities and lawyers – as well as associations representing Filipino and Indian nurses in the UK – are calling for an urgent review of the contract terms, which they say are discriminatory. The British Indian Nurses Association believes the issue has flown under the radar for so long because migrant nurses – particularly those from India – are unlikely to complain. “For them, this is better than being in India. They don’t realise they are being treated unfairly,” a spokesman said. Francis Fernando, a community nurse leader in London, said nurses were already paying “exorbitant fees” linked to their visa applications at a time when the NHS was desperate for nurses, on top of the threat of potential repayment costs. “This isn’t encouraging nurses to come here to help with our vacancies,” he said. “We are shooting ourselves in the foot. We have to do better as a society.” Associations representing care home providers did not respond to requests for comment last week. But Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, which represents NHS trusts, said they valued “the very important contribution” of overseas nurses and recognised that “to help staff make the move from abroad, supporting them with some of the associated costs is also important”. NHS Employers publishes guidance for organisations to “develop and communicate the financial packages available,” Mortimer said. He pointed to the government’s code of practice for the international recruitment of health and social care staff in England, which says “no individual should be charged fees to gain employment” – but does not mention repayment clauses. The Institute for Human Rights and Business (IHRB), said that, as with all jobs, there was a “normal rate of attrition” involved with hiring from overseas that employers had to factor in. “Companies have to accept that as a business cost,” Neill Wilkins, head of the IHRB migrant workers programme said. “The British government’s own modern slavery statement says recruitment costs should be borne not by workers but by employers.” It is not the first time repayment terms have been in the spotlight. In 2018, two major outsourcing firms were threatened with legal action by former employees who had been met with demands for up to £20,000 in training costs when they tried to leave within two years. And in 2019, an employment tribunal sided with an Indian nurse who had £2,000 deducted from her wages by a care home provider, which had claimed it was repayment of a loan to cover her training costs when she left within two years of starting the job. Employment Judge Christopher Camp said the idea it was a loan was “illusory” and that it was actually an unenforceable penalty clause. The use of the clauses by care providers, he said, was an “increasingly common practice”. Alex Bernardino, a nurse from the Philippines, is currently locked in a legal battle with his old employer over a £7,000 fee. He had agreed to the care home’s three-year term on arrival in the UK – despite it being different from the contract he had been shown while in the Philippines – because he thought it was the norm and planned to stay for “the longest of times”. “Maybe I was naive,” said Bernardino, who is not using his real name because of the legal case. “I was just thinking, ‘I’m going to be there for that long anyway.’ I was really excited; I just wanted to be in the UK.” The reality of his life in the UK turned out to be different from what he imagined. In his first few months, he says he witnessed staff being verbally abusive to elderly residents and “talking down” to them. After raising concerns, he claims managers did nothing and he was bullied by colleagues. “In the Philippines I was an emergency room nurse,” he said. “But they told me I was not really a nurse and treated me as a janitor, making me clean the floors.” He was offered a job in the NHS in London, which he accepted. But the care home told him he would have to pay £7,000 – a fee he is currently being pursued for. If he does end up having to pay the sum, for which he was never given a breakdown, the consequences will be dire. With a wife and young children to support, his family will “have to make sacrifices”. “I will have to work more; to do overtime to be able to afford everything,” he said. “But if I stayed in that care home I would be very miserable. So it would’ve been worse.” Parosha Chandran, a barrister who helped draft the UK’s modern slavery laws, and professor of modern slavery law at King’s College London, called for use of the clauses to be urgently reviewed by the government. She said workers could be put under “huge amounts of pressure by these contract clauses to stay in employment” in conditions akin to debt bondage. “Like any other worker there might be myriad reasons – personal or professional – that lead them to take a tough decision to leave,” she said. “But unlike healthcare workers not subject to those contracts, there is a sum of money, regarded as a debt, that has to be paid back before the person is free. “Clearly there has been an entrenchment of conditioning in the minds of migrant workers, and their employers, to think this is acceptable when it is not.”",News/Society,Trapped and destitute: how foreign nurses’ UK dreams turned sour ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/27/trapped-and-destitute-how-foreign-nurses-uk-dreams-turned-sour
