1/14/2022,"A 294-ton, 213-foot-long superload will slowly make its way out of New York state and across 400-plus miles of Pennsylvania roadways for nine days. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation reported that the journey was to start Wednesday night in West Milton, a hamlet in Saratoga County, New York, and is scheduled to end Jan. 21 at Alaron Nuclear Services in Wampum, Lawrence County. The freight: An empty steel tank decommissioned in 1996 at the D1G Prototype reactor plant on the Naval Nuclear Laboratory's Kenneth A. Kesselring Site in West Milton. A PennDOT spokeswoman said the tank will be disassembled, recycled and disposed of by Alaron, which does low-level radioactive materials processing. The superload is expected to cause traffic stoppages and delays as Perkins Specialized Transportation Contracting, of Becker, Minnesota, uses two traffic lanes for hauling. The convoy will move at the posted speed limit or 30 mph, whichever is lower. The majority of the transport is expected to occur at night, but activity could be affected or delayed by winter weather. The travel plan reaches 16 Pennsylvania counties and will feature ramp maneuvers and unusual traffic patterns, PennDOT reported. Tonight, a 213-foot-long, 294-ton #SuperLoad starts its over 400-mile trek from West Milton, New York, to Wampum, Pennsylvania. Drivers along the planned route should remain alert for this two-lane operation.
