12/12/2021,"Someone with a famous last name and a whole lot of pull inside of Ford (F) is sending a message to the market: The bull run in the automaker's stock may just be beginning.  Rather under the radar this week, Bill Ford — great-grandson of Ford founder Henry Ford and its current executive chairman — opted to exercise nearly 2 million in stock options awarded to him as part of his executive pay package. Total cost: $20.5 million. A large portion of the options were reportedly set to expire soon, in other words they would be worthless. The options were exercised at prices ranging from $6.19 to $15.37, according to a filing with the SEC. ""Rather than exercise the options and sell the shares immediately to realize the gains, he opted to exercise the options and buy the shares at the option price. In this case, he paid to acquire the shares and he also paid the associated taxes and fees rather than sell any shares to cover those costs,"" a Ford spokesperson explained to Yahoo Finance. The purchases by Ford come as insiders across corporate America dump stock into the year-end for various reasons, as Yahoo Finance Live discussed here.  Wall Street's newfound bullishness on Ford's stock reflects the ongoing operational turnaround at the company under CEO Jim Farley and Bill Ford's push for greener automobiles. Solid third quarter earnings for Ford helped, too. Ford's third quarter adjusted earnings came in at 51 cents a share, trouncing analyst estimates for 27 cents. Net sales of $33.2 billion beat analyst projections by about $800 million despite the semiconductor shortage crimping production levels. For the full year, Ford estimates adjusted profits of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion. Previously, Ford expected earnings of $9 billion to $10 billion. The company also reinstated its dividend, which it had cut at the height of the pandemic in 2020. Shares of Ford are up 131% year-to-date, running over Detroit-based rival GM's pedestrian 42% gain.

12/12/2021,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has refused to comply with a subpoena for documents related to the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus, saying the former president ordered him not to, according to his response to a congressional request released on Saturday. The subpoena was issued in November by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis as part of its probe of whether former Trump administration officials mishandled the federal response to the pandemic by interfering with its own health agency's work. Nearly 800,000 people have died in the United States from the pandemic. Navarro, a Republican, also served as one of former President Donald Trump's pandemic response advisers and was responsible for procurement in the coronavirus response, among other things. Navarro said in a letter to the subcommittee he would not cooperate because Trump told him to ""protect executive privilege."" ""It is a direct order that I should not comply with the subpoena,"" Navarro said in a letter to the committee, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. Representative James Clyburn, a Democrat and chairman of the coronavirus crisis panel, said in a letter to Navarro that he had no valid basis for refusing to comply and that he had waived any privilege by writing about conversations with Trump on the coronavirus response. The refusal is ""particularly indefensible given that you disclosed many details about your work in the White House, including details of conversations with the former President about the pandemic response, in your recent book and related press tour,"" Clyburn said in the letter. Navarro could not be immediately reached for a response to Clyburn's letter. Clyburn said the subcommittee expects Navarro to produce all records and information in his possession and appear for a deposition on Dec. 15, as the subpoena requires. Clyburn said when the subpoena was issued that ""rather than implement a coordinated national strategy to alleviate critical supply shortages, Mr. Navarro and other Trump Administration officials pushed responsibility to the states and pursued a haphazard and ineffective approach to procurement -- contributing to severe shortages of critically needed supplies and putting American lives at risk.""
