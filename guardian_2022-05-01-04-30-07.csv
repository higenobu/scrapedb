5/1/2022,"Disgraced Tory MP Neil Parish, who resigned his seat on Saturday after admitting he had twice watched pornography in the House of Commons chamber, appeared to have committed a criminal offence which carried a maximum two-year prison sentence, Labour said. Parish, who had represented the safe west country seat of Tiverton and Honiton since 2010, said that on the first occasion he watched porn on his mobile phone next to other MPs, including women, he had done so by accident. But in an emotional interview announcing his resignation, in which he came close to breaking down in tears, he said his “biggest crime” was to have done so again – this time deliberately and in what he called “a moment of madness” – while waiting to vote. Explaining what had happened, Parish, who also runs a farm, told BBC Politics South West: “The situation was that – funnily enough it was tractors I was looking at. I did get into another website that had a very similar name and I watched it for a bit which I shouldn’t have done. “But my crime – biggest crime – is that on another occasion I went in a second time.” Asked if that was deliberate, he admitted: “That was deliberate … that was sitting waiting to vote on the side of the chamber.” Parish added: “I will have to live with this for the rest of my life. I made a huge terrible mistake and I’m here to tell the world.” The dramatic resignation, after a week of lurid allegations about MPs’ conduct, comes just days before Thursday’s local elections throughout the UK, which are being viewed as a key test of Boris Johnson’s ability to survive as prime minister after Partygate and other scandals. Parish’s exit now sets the stage for a second byelection battle this summer for the Tories, as Johnson fights for his political life. Last night Jess Phillips, Labour’s shadow minister for domestic abuse and safeguarding, said that it appeared that Parish “of his own admission” had committed a criminal offence under the Indecent Displays (Control) Act of 1981. The act states that: “If any indecent matter is publicly displayed the person making the display and any person causing or permitting the display to be made shall be guilty of an offence.” It adds that: “Any matter which is displayed in or so as to be visible from any public place shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be publicly displayed.” Sentences range from a fine to up to two years in prison. Phillips, who said the law was not widely known about and therefore not often enforced, told the Observer: “If this law was to be applied it appears he has committed an offence by his own admission.” Phillips said Labour would now call for a full review into the law’s application and how many charges had been brought under it. She said a public information campaign should also be launched as a matter of urgency to enable people to know that watching porn where others could see it was already illegal, including on public transport. Phillips said: “There are plenty of laws on the statute books that are meant to protect women and girls in society, however they are not enacted. They are very rarely enacted appropriately. “People don’t know they can complain about it. What we will do now is look into where charging has and hasn’t happened [under this law], such as on transport networks where people watch it on the bus next you.” She added that greater awareness of the act would not be enough, but charges needed to be brought under it to demonstrate to people that watching pornography in public was completely unacceptable and would lead to prosecutions. On Friday Parish had referred himself to the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, for investigation, but had said he would only stand down if found guilty. He said yesterday he changed his mind after realising the pressure he was putting his family under and the damage he was doing to his party. Parish was identified and stripped of the whip on Friday afternoon after two female colleagues had claimed last week they had seen him looking at adult content on his phone while sitting near them in the chamber. Although Parish retained the Tiverton and Honiton seat with a majority of more than 24,000 in 2019, the Liberal Democrats are now certain to pour resources into the midterm contest there as they battle to re-establish themselves as a force in the west country. The Tories are already bracing themselves for another even tougher byelection test in the “red wall” seat of Wakefield, after Conservative MP Imran Ahmad Khan resigned following a conviction for sexually assaulting a boy aged 15 in 2008. Labour had held Wakefield since the 1930s until Khan took the seat at the 2019 general election with a majority of 3,358. Writing in the Observer, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle demands a radical overhaul of the working practices in Westminster, after a series of scandals over sexual harassment and bullying. Commons staff have been pushing for an overhaul for some time. They have raised concerns that the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme, set up in the wake of sexual harassment and bullying claims, remains a complicated, slow and often intimidating process. Some 43 complaints against MPs have been investigated by the service in the last three years. It is understood that the number for the current year is similar to last year’s figure of 15 MPs. Hoyle is working to form a “Speaker’s conference” – essentially a cross-party committee – to examine swift reforms and back an overhaul. Such a conference was last called in 2008 to examine the representation of women, ethnic minorities and disabled people in the Commons. The committee will hear expert evidence before finalising the reforms. It would have to be formally approved by the government and the Commons.",News/Politics,Disgraced Tory MP Neil Parish ‘broke law’ by watching porn in Commons,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/30/disgraced-tory-mp-neil-parish-broke-law-by-watching-porn-in-commons
5/1/2022,"There is probably only one thing a manager can do at Paris Saint-Germain that would enhance his reputation, which is to win the Champions League – and even then there would be plenty of people looking at the £900m net spend since the Qatari takeover in 2011 and thinking: “About time.” Mauricio Pochettino has not done that. If, as seems likely despite his insistence this week he is staying, he leaves PSG in the summer, he does so with the blot of a rare second-placed league finish on his record. He will at least have answered the criticism that he had never won silverware – collecting last season’s Coupe de France and this season’s Ligue 1 title – but that jibe was always largely meaningless; leading Tottenham to third, second and third in successive seasons, and to the second-highest points tally in their top-flight history (adjusting for two/three points for a win and size of the division), is a greater achievement. But there is a sense now that Pochettino’s status has diminished over his two years in France. Even offering all the usual caveats about social media polls, it is remarkable that when Gary Neville asked his Twitter following last month whether they would prefer Manchester United to appoint Pochettino or Erik ten Hag, 82% went for the manager with no Premier League experience. Of course the failure to win the league last season must count against Pochettino. PSG’s budget is roughly double that of its nearest rivals; it is a sad fact of the economics of modern French football that if PSG do not win the league it is a failure. That Pochettino was there for only half the season isn’t really an excuse. The problem was that PSG took just four points from the six games against Lille, Monaco and Lyon, the three other sides who made up the top four. They were found wanting in matches against the toughest opposition, which for a club that places such a priority on the Champions League is a major problem. But that has always been the paradox of PSG: the stronger it grows the less it is challenged, and the less it is challenged the less equipped it is to win the battles against sides near its own level. Domination breeds decadence, which is why the history of PSG in the Champions League is of hilarious collapses. The arrival of Lionel Messi only exacerbated the tendency. A front three of Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappé may be one of the most exciting ever assembled, but there is a cost, which is that their extravagance must be balanced by a hard-grafting and deep-lying midfield, militating against the sort of integrated football that defines the best, rather than merely the wealthiest, sides in the world. None of this is Pochettino football and it is his fault only in that he took the job. Perhaps earning a reported £5.6m a year after tax, living in Paris and picking up a couple of cheap trophies is attractive, but PSG as a club is almost unmanageable. The stars and their egos dominate. Imposing the sort of modern, cohesive pressing that characterised Pochettino’s sides at Tottenham, Southampton and Espanyol is largely futile. So, yes, Pochettino’s time at PSG has been underwhelming and, yes, two years of a manager’s career can’t just be written off as irrelevant, but to succeed at PSG is almost impossible – his sacked predecessor, Thomas Tuchel, who also bears responsibility for the league failure, ended the season after moving to Chelsea by winning the Champions League. Results had fallen off in the final months at Tottenham, progress to the Champions League final masking a dismal end to the 2018-19 season, and they were 14th in the Premier League when he was sacked in November 2019, but the problems with the squad had long been signposted by Pochettino. The move to the new stadium restricted budgets and limited investment, but just as big an issue was the failure to move on players Pochettino felt had begun to go stale – and his intense style of management means that he perhaps exhausts certain players more quickly than most. Burned by appointing José Mourinho when he was long past his peak, Manchester United apparently worried that Pochettino’s best days might be behind him. And it is true that the past three years have not been particularly impressive. But he is two years younger than Ten Hag, even if he has been managing three years longer, and has a broader experience. There are perfectly good reasons to appoint Ten Hag, provided he is given the right structure. But if United’s decision really was unduly influenced, as has been suggested, by concerns that Pochettino is in decline or by that poll, it only emphasises concerns about the lack of football understanding at the top of the club. This is not like the Mourinho situation. Pochettino’s slight recent downturn is unlikely to be a result of him having lost energy or motivation, of him struggling to connect with younger players or of football having moved beyond his interpretation of it. So what next if Pochettino does leave PSG in the summer? United seemed ideal for him given he appears to have the force of personality as well as the coaching nous that will be necessary. It may be he only has to wait a year and that opportunity will come round again. But another possibility could occur sooner, given Antonio Conte is the clear favourite to replace him at PSG – indeed, beyond Zinedine Zidane, who is apparently hoping for the France job after the World Cup, Conte is the only real alternative candidate at present. And that is a return to Tottenham. Conventional wisdom says you should never go back, although David Moyes says otherwise. And Pochettino would return, oddly, with power enhanced, given the concessions and assurances Daniel Levy would presumably have to offer to persuade him to return – and if he loses Conte, credibility would demand a major figure. Pochettino would also have his reputation strengthened given his warnings four years ago were clearly correct. This is a bit of unfinished business that might just be satisfactorily concluded.",Sport/Football,"Pochettino and the paradox at PSG, a club that is almost unmanageable | Jonathan Wilson",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/30/pochettino-and-the-paradox-at-psg-a-club-that-is-almost-unmanageable
5/1/2022,"A radical overhaul of the working practices in Westminster is being demanded by the House of Commons Speaker, in the wake of a series of scandals over sexual harassment and bullying that have rocked parliament. After a week in which MPs and staff have spoken out over their treatment in the Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle said that a review of how parliament functions was now “urgently needed” following the damaging revelations. In what would be a major restructuring of how parliament operates, Hoyle wants to look at ending the current arrangements under which MPs employ their staff directly. Instead, he wants to create a system with an outside body employing staff. It would in effect provide an independent body to help MPs and staff with concerns. Writing in the Observer, Hoyle states: “I believe it is time we reviewed our working practices, and particularly whether it is right that individual MPs are the employers of their staff. Should someone else – or an outside body – employ the staff, as long as the MP has the right to choose them? “In my opinion, it is time to consider radical action, and review structures and processes that could make a difference. Some serious allegations have been made, and we must address them as a matter of urgency. It is imperative we do the right thing by staff and MPs as well. At the end of the day, I want to make sure that everyone feels they have support and somewhere to turn – and to make this house not only a safe and inclusive place to work, but a model for other legislatures.” The proposals come after a dismal few weeks for parliament’s reputation. Tory MP Neil Parish resigned on Saturday for viewing porn in the Commons chamber. Last week, Labour MP Liam Byrne was found to have bullied a former member of staff and will be suspended from the Commons for two days as a result. Earlier this month, Tory MP David Warburton was suspended from the parliamentary party after allegations relating to sexual harassment and cocaine use. Meanwhile, another Tory MP, Imran Ahmad Khan, has resigned after being found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. Commons staff have been pushing for an overhaul for some time. They have raised concerns that the independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS), set up in the wake of sexual harassment and bullying claims, remains a complicated, slow and often intimidating process.

But it hasn’t changed the culture of bullying and harassment that goes on in MPs’ offices. It’s time to address the issue further up the river. MPs are not in an appropriate position to manage staff and be responsible for their entire employment. “We must bring in a new employment structure for parliament, where one overall body hires staff; [where] there is a formal HR department; and while MPs can still choose who they hire, they are no longer in the position of unabated power over their staff.”",News/Politics,Speaker calls for overhaul of UK parliament after series of scandals,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/30/speaker-calls-for-overhaul-of-uk-parliament-after-series-of-scandals
5/1/2022,"In praise of Rodri. This was always likely to be his kind of game. If only because when it comes to resistance, to stiffening the sinews, to pushing back against peskiness, Manchester City like to sail close to the wind. This is a team built to play in the spaces, not the clinches, to float and probe and run through its angles and lines. For everything else, well there’s Rodri. Remember to close the back door old boy. This always looked a serious hurdle for City in that three-legged race to the line in the Premier League. Elland Road was boisterously full and Jesse Marsch had promised that Leeds would be “pesky” here. He also said they would be “annoying”, “aggressive” and “dangerous”. He says a lot of good stuff. There is something of the high-end corporate communicator about Leeds’ manager, the Ivy League inspirationalist, frontman for a seven-stage motivational programme called something like Find Your Wolf Spirit. But Marsch is clear and likeable and knows how to organise a team. The players have responded to what is, on the face of it, a muddier, less expansive, less fun style of play because the manager has taken them with him. Marsch invites you in, explains his plan in micro-detail, then goes ahead and does it. So we knew Leeds would play in compact units, would press without losing their shape. Even after they went behind this was a horribly tight, bruising contest, Leeds players buffeting and harrying with a sustained intensity. The pitch looked small. At times there seemed to be too much white on it, those roving territorial units circling the ball, squeezing round it like a fist, shutting the angles. This is football translated into a kind of tightly woven blitz defence, a denial of space and air and lines of sight. Rodri was hugely important in those moments. They needed that peg, that central supporting wall, the ability to bounce the ball back and around the corner. Rodri has had some loose periods this season. But this was City’s ninth game in April. Rodri has started eight of them. Every one of them has been an all-or-nothing affair. You tend to notice him these in games where the opposition tries to make City bend, to reduce the game to duels, collisions, peeled-eyeball pressing, where you need a point of stillness. At times like these you need a unit in your team. Rodri was the only City player in this XI with an obvious physical presence. Mainly, though, he did the basics with precision and force, stitching the game together around the centre circle. Rodri has completed more passes than any other midfielder in the Premier League. City haven’t lost an away game this season with him in the team. Here at least, he wasn’t alone, as City lined up in a 4-3-3, but with Ilkay Gündogan offering deeper support in central midfield. There was a nice little Rodri moment right at the start. Leeds had a breakaway as João Cancelo, the last man at a corner, fell flat on his face. Suddenly Rodrigo was in a straight sprint for goal from inside his own half, with Raphinha in pursuit and blue shirts scurrying back. Rodrigo delayed. Gündogan, haring back, blocked the cross. But Rodri’s run was also key, a run to the space not the ball, blocking off the lay-up for Raphinha in the middle, the kind of run that does not tick the stats over, doesn’t register in the highlights reel, and goes unnoticed until you pull the angles of intersection apart in slow motion. Leeds started with an extra defender on the pitch, playing at times with a man inside and an outside right-back, Stuart Dallas, pre-empting the usual City double-teaming by pre-overloading that flank. Dallas stuck to Grealish, following him back into his own half, his left hand draped rakishly around the back of his neck. With 11 minutes gone he fouled Grealish again, this time in a more dangerous spot on the left flank. It was the key moment in the game. Phil Foden’s delivery was hard, flat and wickedly accurate. Rodri leaped early and glanced the ball on expertly into the far corner of the net. Players like this tend to score goals like these. This was Rodri’s second in a week. It was a good finish, and a sharp little run. Rodri has ploughed though the last month, and suffered more than most away to Atlético Madrid, when the second half became a constant weather front of knees and elbows and tugs and pinches. This was a sweet moment for the still centre of that revolving midfield. By half-time he was up to 43 touches and 95% pass completion, filling the spaces, pulling that stitching a little tighter, nudging this hard-fought, bruising game City’s way.",Sport/Football,Rodri provides midfield sinew as Manchester City muscle past Leeds | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/30/rodri-provides-midfield-sinew-as-manchester-city-muscle-past-leeds
5/1/2022,"The title stare-off becomes steelier with each week. Elland Road was at its raucous best and a highly motivated Leeds played well enough to ensure Manchester City rarely neared full stride. Nevertheless the leaders mastered the situation, showing they can win via set pieces when means of higher aesthetic merit elude them. Rodri and Nathan Aké proved the point with goals in each half, garnished later by Gabriel Jesus’ sixth in three matches and a Fernandinho daisycutter, and Pep Guardiola’s delight at the outcome was obvious. This had been a possible banana skin, with the potential leveller of such a highly charged atmosphere; instead City cruise on and Leeds, who are in genuine danger of going down, must seek more viable routes to safety. This encounter had an edge from the outset. It needed to, because the heat had been turned up on both teams. City would have expected Liverpool to achieve what was necessary at Newcastle; Leeds might not have banked on Burnley’s turnaround at Watford and began directly above the relegation zone. That did not appear fair reward for 11 points from their previous five games but Jesse Marsch’s players are in a dogfight; their fans knew it and, at kick-off, the noise was deafening. It should have leapt off the scale within three minutes. City had, naturally, hogged possession but were caught after their own corner was hooked away. João Cancelo, one of five returnees as Guardiola sought a delicate balance before Wednesday’s visit to Real Madrid, slipped in the centre circle and suddenly Rodrigo had 60 yards of exposed turf to devour. Even without the pace to see the whites of Ederson’s eyes, there was an opportunity to feed the open Raphinha to his right. But he delayed and, by the time he had spotted the chance, Ilkay Gündogan had raced back to block. The Leeds left-back Junior Firpo was soon booked for a cheap foul but they paid more dearly when his equivalent on the right, Stuart Dallas, committed another. Phil Foden swung over the free-kick and Rodri, running across Kalvin Phillips, glanced a text book header beyond Illan Meslier. Leeds’ organisation was nowhere; they could rue the withdrawal, during the warm-up, of their captain Liam Cooper with an apparent knee injury. Marsch flung his arms in frustration, seemingly at the decision to penalise Dallas; City’s fans let off a flare but the occasion’s early heat risked being extinguished there and then. To their credit, Leeds managed to maintain it. One devilish cross from Raphinha brought a clash of heads between Aymeric Laporte and Robin Koch, both of whom eventually continued despite the former’s discomfort at taking the heavier impact. Second balls were snapped into, every challenge appreciated from the stands, and for their broad control City found little rhythm. Cancelo cleared Luke Ayling’s cross but Firpo, in space, collected his header. It was a decent position but he shot over; Leeds came no closer before half-time despite bursts of pressure but Pascal Struijk, bailing out an Ayling error to thwart Raheem Sterling, ensured proceedings would retain their intensity. A thudding late challenge by Dallas on Jack Grealish confirmed as much; the Leeds player came off far worse and, clearly in considerable pain, was carried off. It was a traumatic way to end such a competitive half. Dan James replaced Dallas and Leeds seemed to have cleared their heads well enough upon re-emerging, again restricting the space in which a sometimes uncomfortable-looking City could operate. How frustrating for Marsch and the watching Cooper, then, that they were picked off by another dead ball. This time Foden’s right-sided corner was met beyond the far post by Rúben Dias, rising above two weak challenges; the recalled Aké, who had scored in City’s 7-0 thrashing of these opponents in December, was placed to sweep in from six yards ahead of Struijk and offer Guardiola ample reward for his squad rotation. City’s celebrations suggested they knew the goal’s importance. This had certainly not been a sure thing but now the acknowledgement that Leeds’ race was run felt universal. Aké departed almost immediately with a knock, having made perhaps his most significant contribution in City’s colours, and from hereon it would surely be an extended exercise in game management. Marsch, for his part, was in no mood to dial down: he was booked by Paul Tierney, presumably for words directed to the fourth official. Raphinha might have set up a thrilling final 15 minutes had Laporte not intervened. Instead Jesus, sent clear by Foden, beat Meslier before Fernandinho had his say with the last kick.",Sport/Football,Manchester City in title driving seat after cruising to win at Leeds ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/30/leeds-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report
5/1/2022,"Suspicion was cast over Conservative MPs and a stream of damaging headlines were printed in the four days between claims that a member of the party viewed pornography in the Commons and Neil Parish’s resignation on Saturday. The senior backbencher’s initial silence, followed by his insistence that he would stay in the job after he was named on Friday, have all helped prolong the torrid affair for the Tories. Criticism has also been aired at the Tory whips for taking days to suspend him in the run-up to next week’s local elections. It was at a meeting of female members of the Conservative 2022 group in Westminster on Tuesday night when the allegation first emerged. Two women said they had witnessed a male colleague watching pornography. One, a minister, said she had also seen him viewing adult material in a committee meeting. Reporters learned of the allegations the following morning, but not the name of the culprit, with the Conservatives keeping that quiet. Tory chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris responded by calling the behaviour “wholly unacceptable” and launching an investigation. After demands for firmer and faster action, he called for the case to be referred to Parliament’s Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS). The watchdog that investigates allegations of harassment and sexual misconduct went on to open an investigation after a referral from at least one of the witnesses. Women in parliament came forward to decry the “shameful” culture at the heart of British democracy and international trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan described once being “pinned up against a wall” by a former MP. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, said the porn-watching was “clearly totally unacceptable” but urged people to await the ICGS investigation. On Friday, the Telegraph approached the Conservatives saying it was preparing to reveal that it was Parish at the centre of the allegations. Heaton-Harris released a statement saying he was suspending the Tory whip from the 65-year-old MP for Tiverton and Honiton. Journalists tracked Parish down to his Somerset farmhouse, where his wife learned of the news from a reporter and both faced uncomfortable questions. Sue Parish said “it was all very embarrassing” as she defended her husband: “He’s quite a normal guy, really. He’s a lovely person. It’s just so stupid.” Asked if he had opened something in error in the Commons, the MP said: “I did, but let the inquiry look at that.” But on Saturday the pressure intensified. A Conservative source told the PA news agency it was likely that Parish would now be resigning within hours, with a second local source suggesting allies in Westminster were urging him to quit. Party sources said that pressure was not coming from Tory HQ. His resignation will trigger a byelection in the Devonshire constituency that is historically safe for the Tories. The Liberal Democrats will relish the chance to snatch it though. Parish will continue to face an investigation by the ICGS and questions as to why he did not save the Tories’ blushes in the run-up to Thursday’s local elections by resigning days earlier.",News/Politics,Four days of drift that let the Neil Parish scandal grow and grow,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/30/four-days-of-drift-that-let-the-neil-parish-phone-porn-scandal-grow-and-grow
