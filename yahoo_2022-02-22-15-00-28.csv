2/22/2022,"By Maria Tsvetkova KYIV (Reuters) - Alisa, a 38-year-old Ukrainian with an office job in the capital, had always enjoyed sport shooting and joined a local territorial defence unit more than a year ago to acquire combat skills. Now she is worried she might have to use those skills in a real war with Russia. ""People die, that's horrible. Even worse is when you think not just about your life but about the life of a 7-year-old child,"" she said in an interview with Reuters in her house outside Kyiv while her son, Timur, watched cartoons. ""I realise he can be hurt because of silliness of the neighbouring country, not a brother country anymore,"" said Alisa, who asked to be identified only by her first name. Russia's build-up of tens of thousands of troops near the borders with Ukraine has stirred fears in Ukraine and Western countries that it is poised to invade, something Moscow denies. Alisa joined the territorial defence forces a year and a half ago, earlier than many. In January, as the Russian troops massed, the government said it wanted to build reserve batallions up into a corps of up to 130,000 people. Alisa said she has seen dozens of new people joining the training sessions each Saturday. She began this weekend as she often does, putting on camouflage fatigues, taking one of her two small-calibre guns she keeps at home and heading to a training ground - a pine forest with sand dunes, an old railway and few abandoned construction sites. Along with dozens of other volunteers, mostly men in their late 30s and 40s with civilian jobs, she then spent seven hours either with her weapon on the ground or on guard as a part of a small patrol tasked to protect a concrete building from enemy saboteurs. She said the fact she has at least basic training is some comfort. ""If, God forbid, a war starts ... I know how to move from an unsafe point A to a safe point B,"" Alisa said. ""I understand how to do if I'm under fire. I know how to help Timur, friends, neighbours if they are caught in fire."" EARLY STARTS Alisa, a motorcycle fan, has visited more 50 countries along with her husband, also a biker. She is a media relations specialist at an organization that works in cyber security. She tries not to skip training sessions herself even if she badly needs rest at the end of the working week. ""If we had peace time I would miss training if I was tired but now I make myself get up early for a session because now it's needed more than ever,"" she said. Alisa said she likes gaining new skills that have built her self-confidence and courage, but hopes never to have to use them. ""I feel anger, hatred and I have my plans cancelled. It's all surreal for me and I don't get how such silly things can happen in a civilized world in the 21st century,"" she said.

2/22/2022,"Harvard economist Jason Furman said Russia's economy is 'unimportant' except for its gas resources, The New York Times reported. His comments come as the US and Europe prepare heavy sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine. But there are concerns that their plans to punish Moscow will penalize the rest of the world too. Russia's economy is ""incredibly unimportant in the global economy except for oil and gas,"" Jason Furman, Harvard economist and ex-adviser to former President Barack Obama, told The New York Times. ""It's basically a big gas station,"" he said. His comments come as the West prepares heavy sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine. While they have the potential to throw the entire Russian economy into chaos, these measures could also reverberate to further damage the US, Europe, and the rest of the world as they battle inflation and rising energy prices — a ripple effect that the West hopes to mitigate. On Monday, Moscow declared the independence of two breakaway regions of Ukraine and sent troops there — escalating the prospect of a major war. President Joe Biden has already ordered sanctions on the separatist regions — Donetsk and Luhansk — prohibiting US citizens from engaging in any exports, imports, or new investments in these areas. Despite Russia's size and wealth in raw materials, its economy is more on-par with Brazil than with nations like Germany, France, and the UK, according to the latest nominal GDP data from the World Bank. According to the World Bank, its economy is weaker than Italy's and South Korea's, two nations with less than half of Russia's population. But as Furman notes, Russia's oil and gas exports are significant to the world. The European Union imports around 80% of the natural gases it uses, according to the US Energy Information Administration, and Russia accounts for 41% of the natural gas imports and 27% of the oil imports in the continent, per Eurostat. Compounded with energy prices in the EU surging in price from 20 euros to 180 euros a megawatt-hour over the last year, the disappearance of those gas and oil imports could spell disaster for the region and the interconnected global economy. Meanwhile, in the US, gas prices have hit a seven-year high, climbing to around $3.50 per gallon, while inflation burgeons at its highest rate in 40 years, at 7.5%. On the other hand, Ukraine has also been a major supplier of grain to other regions, sending 40% of its wheat and corn exports to the Middle East and Africa, The Times reported. In response to a potential food crisis in those regions, US Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said on Saturday that American farmers would increase production and ""step in and help our partners,"" the Associated Press reported. Ukraine accounts for 12% of the entire world's grain exports, and is estimated to provide 16% of global corn exports this year, the AP reported. Vilsack told the outlet he believed that American consumers would largely be unaffected, but Europeans would face ""a different story."" ""You have to look at the backdrop against which this is coming,"" Gregory Daco, chief economist for consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told The Times. ""There is high inflation, strained supply chains and uncertainty about what central banks are going to do and how insistent price rises are.""

2/22/2022,"A Chinese woman purportedly studying in Brisbane, Australia, was recently filmed rejecting the claim of Uyghur Muslims being detained in ""concentration camps"" in China as she took down posters featuring photos of the Tiananmen Square protests created to support Hong Kong’s democracy.

The incident, filmed by Billie Kugelman, chief editor of student newspaper Semper Floreat at the University of Queensland, was shared online by Drew Pavlou, an outspoken critic of the Chinese government and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) who is running to “represent Queensland in the Australian senate.”
 


The video shows the unidentified woman, whose face is blurred, arguing with Kugelman as she tears down posters from the university’s Lennon Wall.

“You are ruining my liberty. I don't want to show my face,” the woman tells Kugelman. “I just want to show that I'm not (afraid) to show my freedom.”

Kugelmen responds by saying her face will be blurred in the video, then says, “Can you tell me a bit about why you think it's right to rip these down?”

“Do you think you are right to tell these lies to the students, especially those teenagers?” the woman replies, referring to the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and its photos featured on the posters, one of them being the iconic photo of the ""Tank Man.""

“I don't think they are lies,” Kugleman responds. He asks her if she knows what happened during the massacre – which occurred around 33 years ago – to which she replies, “No, I don't know about that because it happened 40 to 50 years ago... It happened decades ago. I'm just thinking about now, thinking about the future, the students, the teenagers. What's your big influence by this wall?”

“I think the intent is to make them think twice about what’s happening,” Kugelman replies. He eventually brings up the Uyghurs, a Muslim-majority ethnic minority in northwest China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) that has been described as the ""most persecuted ethnicity"" in China, as NextShark previously reported.

“As far as I'm aware, there are Uyghur Muslims in concentration camps,” Kugelman tells the woman after she brings out her phone and fails to show him what “what China is looking like.”

The woman then laughs exaggeratedly at the term “concentration camps.”

""You have jails in Australia, you have jails in Australia,"" the woman says as she walks out on Kugelman.

Pavlou identified the woman as a “Chinese international student” in his tweet on Thursday, but Kugelman corrected him, saying that the woman claimed she was not a student of the university.

2/22/2022,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's prime minister said on Monday a Chinese naval vessel that pointed a laser at an Australian military aircraft was so close to Australia's coast that it could have been seen from the shore, and urged a full Chinese investigation. Scott Morrison told media his government had not received an explanation from China over the incident last Thursday, which Australia considered ""dangerous and reckless"". China said Australia's version of events did ""not square up with facts"" and that Australia had dropped a Sonobuoy, which can help detect submarines, near Chinese ships. The Australian defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Chinese navy vessel directed a military-grade laser at an Australian military aircraft over Australia's northern approaches, illuminating the plane and potentially endangering lives, Australia said on Saturday. Such a laser is normally pointed to designate a target ahead of the discharging of a weapon. The P-8A Poseidon - a maritime patrol aircraft - detected a laser emanating from a People's Liberation Army – Navy (PLA-N) vessel, the Defence Department said, releasing photographs of two Chinese vessels sailing close to Australia's north coast. A Chinese guided missile destroyer and an amphibious transport dock were sailing east through the Arafura Sea between New Guinea and Australia at the time of the incident, and later passed through the narrow Torres Strait. ""It's possible people could even see the vessel from our mainland, potentially,"" Morrison told reporters in Tasmania on Monday. Australia had called through diplomatic and defence channels for ""a full investigation into this event"", he said. He compared the incident to a hypothetical situation of an Australian frigate pointing a laser at Chinese surveillance aircraft in the Taiwan Strait, adding: ""Could you imagine their reaction to that in Beijing?"" China's defence ministry defended the actions of its vessels, saying its vessels abided by international law and pinning any blame on Australia. ""The Australian P-8 anti-submarine patrol aircraft arrived in the airspace around our ship formation, and the nearest was only 4 kilometers away from our ship,"" defence ministry spokesman Tan Kefei said in a post on the ministry's official Weibo page published on Monday. ""From the photos taken by our ships, it can be seen that the Australian plane is very close to our ship and also drops Sonobuoys around our ship. Such malicious provocative behavior is very easy to lead to misunderstanding and misjudgment, posing a threat to the safety of ships and personnel on both sides,"" Tan added. Two Chinese defence ministry stamped photos, which could not be verified, were attached with the Weibo post. ""We demand that the Australian side immediately stop similar provocative and dangerous actions and stop making groundless accusations and smears against the Chinese side, so as not to affect the overall situation of relations between the two countries and two militaries,"" Tan said.

2/22/2022,"A plastic surgeon and a nurse anesthetist in Colorado are now facing criminal charges in connection to a disastrous breast augmentation surgery that led to a young woman’s death in October 2020.

Emmalyn Nguyen, 18, underwent the procedure at Dr. Geoffrey Kim’s Colorado Aesthetics and Plastic Surgery in Greenwood Village on Aug. 1, 2019. After receiving anesthesia, she reportedly experienced two cardiac arrests and ended up with brain damage.

Nguyen’s family’s lawyer, David Woodruff, alleged that nurse Rex Meeker had left the then-18-year-old unattended for 15 minutes after administering the anesthesia. Meeker was reportedly involved in a similar incident in 2007.

Kim, who reportedly revived Nguyen after her first cardiac arrest, allegedly misled her family into thinking that “everything is fine.”



“He said everything is fine, Emmalyn is fine, everything is good. She’s young, she’s healthy, she’ll be okay, it’s just taking her long to wake up,” Nguyen’s mother, Lynn Fam, told CBS Denver.

Nguyen remained in a vegetative state prior to her death in October 2020. She reportedly developed pneumonia in her nursing home and went into cardiac arrest multiple times over a 24-hour period.

Last Wednesday, the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office announced that Kim had surrendered himself over to the police following an arrest warrant. He was charged with criminally negligent homicide and first-degree aggravated assault, both categorized as felonies.

Meeker, on the other hand, was solely charged with manslaughter. A warrant was issued for his arrest, and he remains out of custody at the time of this writing.



“We opened this criminal case in August 2019. The investigation has taken more than two years to complete and involved dozens of interviews and search warrants,” said Captain of Investigations Travis Stewart. “Our hope is that this will be the beginning of bringing justice and a sense of closure to Emmalyn’s family.”

In a statement, the family shared that they are hopeful about ""finally getting justice for Emmalyn.""

“Even though it will never bring our daughter back, at least this will help others from getting hurt and prevent ruining other families' lives,"" the family said, according to CBS News. “We still haven't been able to get closure from Emmalyn's death. Hopefully bringing criminal charges will bring out the truth about what happened and will bring justice for Emmalyn.”

Kim, who turned himself in with his attorney, was later released after posting a $5,000 bond. Last year, he and Meeker agreed to pay $1 million each to Nguyen’s family in a civil settlement, as per CBS Denver.

2/22/2022,"A new study has reignited a debate over the role of vitamin D in mitigating severe COVID-19 symptoms as researchers suggest those with a deficiency may be more likely to develop serious illness. Leading infectious disease experts say that more in-depth research is needed to confirm whether vitamin D is directly associated with COVID-19 severity. Vitamin D cannot prevent COVID-19 transmission all on its own, and experts say its crucial to speak to a doctor before seeking out supplements, as large doses can be harmful to your health. In the report below, you'll learn: Is vitamin D actually beneficial against infections? And can Vitamin D alone prevent COVID-19? Vitamin D's role in the prevention of the spread of COVID-19 has been long contested by many experts since the pandemic began, fueled by early chatter of alternative treatment methods back in 2020. But a new piece of research has once again reignited the public's interest in these supplements, as scientists highlight a possible association between vitamin D levels and the immune system's ability to fend off severe COVID-19 symptoms, particularly associated with the Omicron variant. The small-scale study, which was organized by researchers in Israel and is based on data collected between April 2020 and February 2021, was recently published in PLOS ONE and presents a case that researchers say is ""equally relevant"" for Omicron spread as well. The data was collected from 253 people who were admitted to hospitals for treatment (at a time before vaccines were available) and was used to conclude that those who had a vitamin D deficiency were more likely to develop a severe or critical case of COVID-19, as compared to patients who had sufficient vitamin D levels within blood samples taken at the time of hospitalization. About half of those in the study were deficient in the vitamin. Further links found within the new study suggest that those who were lacking vitamin D were 14 times more likely to experience severe COVID-19 complications, which the National Institutes of Health (NIH) define as someone likely needing a respirator to breathe — and in severe cases, those who experience respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction. Those with a vitamin D deficiency were significantly more likely to die due to infections, the study found; 25.6% mortality rate versus just 2.3% for those who weren't lacking vitamin D. As of February 14, 2022, 252.1 million people have received at least one dose of a #COVID19 vaccine. Of those, 214 million are fully vaccinated. More than 91.8 million people have received a COVID-19 booster dose. Find your COVID-19 vaccine: https://t.co/xbvNiaVJKV. pic.twitter.com/S2APwj03R3 — CDC (@CDCgov) February 14, 2022 Some may come to the conclusion that making sure you get sufficient levels of vitamin D can help keep your immune system in top shape, but other experts are keen to point out that this study doesn't prove that vitamin D alone can save you from severe infection. Paul Spearman, M.D., director of the division of infectious diseases at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, tells Good Housekeeping that more research is needed to confirm whether vitamin D levels will be an indicator of how severe symptoms will be for someone impacted by COVID-19. ""We have to remember that an association doesn't mean causation — meaning, that other things going on in [those people] with low vitamin D levels may cause severe disease, and not the low vitamin D itself,"" he explains, adding that a randomized, controlled, double-blind study of vitamin D supplementation before COVID-19 infection would be needed for concrete proof. ""This type of study is hard to do and requires enrolling a large number of patients."" Dr. Spearman adds that this isn't the first time that vitamin D has been considered in limited meta-analysis research to determine the role this nutrient plays in COVID-19 infections. Conflicting research suggests that low vitamin D levels don't ""aggravate"" COVID-19 risk or death, nor that upping vitamin D supplements in any given routine improves patients' health as they recover in the hospital, he says. A 2021 Nutrition Journal study concluded there wasn't an association between COVID-19 severity and vitamin D levels and a preprint of a study out of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil suggests vitamin D supplements administered to hospitalized patients also didn't provide any recovery benefits. But vitamin D is far from useless, and while its role in preventing or stemming the severity of a COVID-19 infection is still uncertain, Dr. Spearman adds that there are theoretical reasons behind why immune systems may be impacted if someone isn't sufficiently getting enough vitamin D. Nutrition experts have long established that vitamin D is essential for optimal bone health (as it helps absorb calcium) and that the nutrient aids muscle function in addition to being linked to a few other key bodily functions. Vitamin D levels are influenced by nutrition, certainly, as it can be partially sourced from food — things like fatty salmon, beef liver, egg yolks and Swiss cheese all contain ample vitamin D — but is often sourced naturally just by being outside. ""The most well-known way to get your dose of vitamin D is exposing yourself to sunlight,"" says Stefani Sassos, MS, RD, CDN, a registered dietitian in the Good Housekeeping Institute, in an interview touting potential benefits of the supplement. But evidence for vitamin D's role in boosting immunity overall isn't as clear, Dr. Spearman explains. ""Vitamin D has been evaluated to help fight other respiratory infections — unfortunately, we don't have a clear answer here either, except that giving a single large dose isn't helpful at all,"" he says. ""Meta-analyses of this question have been inconclusive."" This new study may add more weight to burgeoning evidence that there may be an association of low vitamin D levels correlated with severe disease, COVID-19 included. But if there is an immune-boosting benefit to be had, ""it is with standard, low doses and not large doses,"" Dr. Spearman clarifies. Experts from across fields of study, including Spearman and Sassos, agree that vitamin D supplements should be a consideration primarily if your doctor has detected you have low vitamin D levels in treatment. If news of this study has you curious about your own vitamin D intake, make it a point to discuss it with your doctor — but you're likely to have sufficient vitamin D coursing through your veins. Only 5% of Americans suffer from a severe vitamin D deficiency, per the NIH, and 18% have been noted to have ""inadequate"" levels which may or may not cause issues associated with aches, cramps, or muscle development, Sassos adds. ""If someone is detected by their doctor as having low vitamin D levels, they should receive supplementation with medical guidance,"" Dr. Spearman advises. ""We should keep in mind that taking large doses of vitamin D is dangerous, and self-medicating can cause problems — including high blood calcium and kidney failure."" ""Whereas excess of water-soluble vitamins are rapidly excreted through urine, fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin D are stored in the body for long periods of time and can pose a higher risk for toxicity if consumed in excess,"" Sassos adds. Taking this study and conflicting research into account, and everything we know about how SARS-CoV-2 impacts both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, it's clear that vitamin D supplements alone cannot prevent COVID-19 transmission. Experts are continuing to examine how vitamin D may play a small role in lowering the risk of someone experiencing a severe sickness or dying after being infected. ""For a normal, healthy person, the role of a low-dose, ongoing supplement in preventing severe COVID-19 is not yet certain,"" Dr. Spearman says. The debate over vitamin D's role in helping bring an end to the pandemic is likely going to continue to be a topic of discussion, as experts are now conducting appropriately prospective, randomized and controlled studies of vitamin D supplementation. ""We hope to have a more definitive answer from these trials, which can provide a higher level of evidence,"" he adds. NEW: Study out of @CDCMMWR today notes the critical importance of staying up to date on CDC’s recommended #COVID19 vaccines. Boosters prevent serious COVID-19 illness. Get vaccinated + boosted. https://t.co/41Jk5FPsej — Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH (@CDCDirector) February 1, 2022 Experts are agreed that the only role vitamin D may play in ending the pandemic may be partial and preventative in nature, versus an active solution after someone has become sick. ""Supplementing vitamin D may play a role in treating patients, but the data is relatively weak at this time,"" Stuart Cohen, M.D., chief of infectious diseases at UC Davis Health, shared in a recent communications report. ""It surely is not a way to treat COVID-19 in and of itself."" Talking to your doctor about vitamin D can be an effective way to make sure you're supporting your immune system with optimal nutrients across the board. It may also help you to consider that, in spite of discussion of alternative forms of prevention, current vaccines have demonstrated their effectiveness at preventing hospitalization and death stemming from COVID-19 infections. Getting enough vitamin D is a valid concern you should discuss with your doctor, especially if you are someone who may be disposed to inadequate or deficient levels of this essential nutrient. Experts have previously established that these at-risk individuals would benefit from discussing vitamin D supplements with a doctor: Adults over the age of 65 People with clinical obesity People diagnosed with liver disease, celiac disease, cystic fibrosis and/or Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis Those who experience limited sun exposure Those with dark skin tones Those enjoying a plant-based lifestyle Your healthcare provider can order a blood test to examine your vitamin D levels, Sassos adds, and can help you figure out which supplements work best for you at the appropriate dosage. ""Taking vitamin D under medical supervision for those who have measured vitamin D deficiencies is warranted,"" Dr. Spearman adds. ""[But] the best prevention of severe COVID-19 is certainly earned through vaccines, and the evidence here is undeniable.""

2/22/2022,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — A Nebraska state senator called for a criminal investigation after one of her colleagues said he would resign after admitting that he took photos of a female legislative aide without her knowledge. Democratic state Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha sent a letter urging the state attorney general and Nebraska State Patrol to investigate the conduct of Republican Sen. Mike Groene to determine if he committed any crimes, according to the Omaha World-Herald. Groene told The Associated Press Friday that he planned to resign this week to avoid putting his family through a public ordeal. The conservative from North Platte who often disagreed with his Democratic colleagues in the Legislature also said he would withdraw from the race for the University of Nebraska Board of Regents and leave politics. Groene announced he would resign after an online news outlet, Nebraska Sunrise News, reported that one of his staffers had filed a complaint after she discovered the photos on Groene's laptop, which he had given her to complete a project. The staffer who was photographed, Kristina Konecko, told the World-Herald that one detail in the initial stories about her complaint was incorrect. She said that she didn't find any evidence that the photos had been sent to anyone else. But Konecko did say that some of the photos were close-ups of parts of her body with sexually suggestive captions. The Associated Press does not typically name victims of sexual harassment, but did so in this case because the newspaper said it published Konecko's name at her request. Groene said he took photos of the staffer, but he described them as harmless images of staffers, visitors and family members in his office. He also denied that any of them were sexual in nature or that focused on particular body parts. Konecko told the newspaper that she filed her complaint under the Legislature's workplace harassment policy in early February, and she has since transferred to another legislative office. She said no one ordered her not to discuss the issue, but she doesn't plan to answer additional questions about it now that it may be investigated. “I have not been advised or directed nor have I received any suggestions or recommendations from any outside sources, but because there has been a call for a formal investigation, I am not going to be answering any questions or sharing any further information,” she said. “However, I am very grateful and appreciative for the outpouring of support and encouragement that I have received from the public.” Groene said he apologized to the staffer after she confronted him about the photos a few weeks ago and believed the matter was over. A Nebraska State Patrol spokesperson told the newspaper it had received Hunt's letter and is talking with the Attorney General's office about it. A spokesperson for the Attorney General said his office will review the letter. Under the Legislature's policy, formal complaints about senators or staffers are filed with the Legislature’s Executive Board, but they’re not released to the public unless the committee finds serious misconduct. During his time in the Legislature Groene fought to lower property taxes and sometimes used abrasive language during floor debate. He also led the Legislature’s Education Committee for four years before his colleagues voted to replace him with a Democratic state senator.

The outlet said Putin twice snapped at Naryshkin to ""speak directly!"" Naryshkin responded that he supported the regions ""becoming a part of Russia,"" prompting Putin to tell him that was not currently being discussed and that recognizing them as independent states was the only thing presently being considered. Hours after the meeting, Putin delivered a long, passionate speech in which he announced Russia was recognizing Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states and ordered troops into the regions.

2/22/2022,"A Chinese movie released just before Valentine’s Day which depicts South Korean speed skaters as rule-breaking bullies has caused outrage among South Korean citizens, prompting a professor to raise the issue to the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

""Fly, Skating Star"" was released on the Chinese platform iQiyi on Feb. 12, days after the Winter Olympics’ recent speed skating disqualification scandal occurred.

The film follows the story of skating genius Cheng Huan and short-track speed skater Shen Bingxin as they participate in an Asian competition to qualify for the 2022 Beijing Winter Games. Cheng and Shen need to overcome a significant obstacle – a team of South Korean skaters who trip Cheng and injure his eye with a skate blade – to achieve their dream of representing China at the Olympics.

Earlier this month, South Korean athletes Hwang Dae-heon and Lee June-seo were disqualified for an illegal late pass and lane change during the men’s 1,000-meter semifinal event. The disqualification helped Team China win gold.

The Korean Sport & Olympic Committee (KSOC) announced that it will file an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) over the “unfairness” of the event’s judging.

Seo Kyung-duk, a professor of general education at Sungshin Women's University, has accused Beijing of ""stirring up hatred against Korea"" after the movie caused outrage in the country, The Korea Times reported.

In a recent Facebook post, Seo said he has raised the issue to IOC President Thomas Bach and other IOC members via email, saying that Beijing’s decision to release the movie is “a violation of the Olympic spirit.”

“How can a country hosting the Olympic Games incite hatred against a neighboring country to evoke patriotism among its people like this?” Seo said.

“I asked the IOC to give a warning to the Beijing city authorities and the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (BOCOG), so that an incident like this would not occur again in the future,"" he added.

Chinese state-run outlet Global Times accused Seo of playing the “newest trick to hype anti-China sentiment” in its headline for its story about the professor’s objection to the movie.

2/22/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Most Japanese think the rollout of booster shots against COVID-19 is too slow and many give mixed reviews to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's handling of the pandemic, including last week's decision to ease border rules, a poll showed. Anger over the Japanese government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic helped sink the administration of Kishida's predecessor, Yoshihide Suga, and Kishida faces a crucial election for the upper house of parliament in July. About 73% of respondents to a Kyodo news agency opinion poll over the weekend felt Japan's rollout of booster shots has been far too slow, though 54.1% approved of how the government had tackled the coronavirus overall. Only 14.4% of the population has received booster shots even though nearly 30% of the country is 65 or older and at greater risk without the protection of the booster. Kishida, who has repeatedly promised to accelerate the booster programme, told a news conference last week he has yet to receive his booster, but should get one early in March. The booster programme has picked up steam in recent days, with more than 700,000 shots a day - nearing Kishida's goal of 1 million by the end of February. Still, February became the deadliest month of the pandemic for Japan on Saturday, with 3,033 deaths so far this month. Nearly half of respondents to the two-day telephone survey said it was ""too early"" to loosen border controls, which have among been the strictest among wealthy nations but were slammed by businesses and educators, a move set to take place in stages from March 1. About 45.7% said the decision, which will open borders to foreigners except for tourists, came too early, Kyodo said, while 34.9% said it was ""appropriate"" and 16.3% saw it as too late. Overall, Kishida's support rose slightly to 56.6% although disapproval of his government edged up 2.2 points to 27.4%.

2/22/2022,"Former President Donald Trump was so angry after his company’s longtime accounting firm severed ties that he apparently placed himself in more legal jeopardy with a reckless responding screed. A letter from accounting firm Mazars USA that said it was dropping the Trump Organization was included in a court document filed last week. It declared that 10 years of financial statements it had created with records provided by the Trump Organization should no longer be considered reliable. Trump blamed an ongoing investigation into him and his business by New York Attorney General Letitia James, whom he claimed “threatened” and “harassed” Mazars into the action. James is investigating whether Trump inflated asset values to obtain bank loans and entice investors, and reduced values to lower tax bills. Trump boasted Tuesday in his lengthy statement on Mazars about his knowledge of the Trump Organization’s financial statements — and about padding the value of some of his business properties in 2014 with an arbitrary 30% Trump brand premium. But that was just a day after his attorneys argued in court documents that Trump “denies knowledge” — and doesn’t even know enough “to form a belief” concerning just about every financial practice at his own company that may be scrutinized in James’ probe. James quickly fired off a letter to the judge presiding over her investigation about Trump’s statement, noting that it flatly contradicted claims by his own attorneys. “It is not unusual for parties to a legal proceeding to disagree about the facts,” James wrote to Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron. “But it is truly rare for a party to publicly disagree with statements submitted by his own attorneys in a signed pleading — let alone one day after the pleading was filed. That is what Mr. Trump has done here.” Clearly, Trump knows “exactly what OAG is investigating,” she wrote, referencing the Office of the Attorney General. NEW!

2/22/2022,"Putin on Monday recognized two separatist regions of eastern Ukraine as independent states. The US ambassador to the UN said Putin is attempting to claim Russia has a rightful claim to all territories from the historic Russian Empire. She said that includes Ukraine, Finland, Belarus, and parts of Poland and Turkey, among others. The US ambassador to the United Nations said on Monday Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to set the world back to a time when the Russian Empire reigned. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield made the comments during a UN Security Council meeting convened to discuss Russia's actions in Ukraine. Earlier on Monday, Putin announced Russia would recognize two separatist regions in Ukraine as independent states and ordered troops into the regions, prompting swift condemnations and threats of sanctions from the West. During the meeting, Thomas-Greenfield said Russia's actions were an attack on Ukraine's sovereignty and a violation of international law. ""He has since announced that he will place Russian troops in these regions. He calls them peacekeepers. This is nonsense. We know what they really are,"" she said, adding that the move was ""clearly the basis for Russia's attempt to create a pretext for a further invasion of Ukraine."" Thomas-Greenfield noted Putin said Russia has a rightful claim to all territories from the historical Russian Empire, which predates the Soviet Union. ""That includes all of Ukraine. It includes Finland. It includes Belarus and Georgia and Moldova. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Lithuania. Latvia and Estonia. It includes parts of Poland and Turkey,"" she said. ""In essence, Putin wants the world to travel back in time, to a time before the United Nations, to a time when empires ruled the world. But the rest of the world has moved forward. It is not 1919, it is 2022,"" Thomas-Greenfield added. The security council meeting was called after a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was ""greatly concerned"" by Russia's actions in eastern Ukraine and reiterated UN remained committed to Ukraine's sovereignty.

2/22/2022,"YUROK RESERVATION, Calif. (AP) — The young mother had behaved erratically for months, hitchhiking and wandering naked through two Native American reservations and a small town clustered along Northern California’s rugged Lost Coast. But things escalated when Emmilee Risling was charged with arson for igniting a fire in a cemetery. Her family hoped the case would force her into mental health and addiction services. Instead, she was released over the pleas of loved ones and a tribal police chief. The 33-year-old college graduate — an accomplished traditional dancer with ancestry from three area tribes — was last seen soon after, walking across a bridge near a place marked End of Road, a far corner of the Yurok Reservation where the rutted pavement dissolves into thick woods. Her disappearance is one of five instances in the past 18 months where Indigenous women have gone missing or been killed in this isolated expanse of Pacific coastline between San Francisco and Oregon, a region where the Yurok, Hupa, Karuk, Tolowa and Wiyot people have coexisted for millennia. Two other women died from what authorities say were overdoses despite relatives’ questions about severe bruises. The crisis has spurred the Yurok Tribe to issue an emergency declaration and brought increased urgency to efforts to build California’s first database of such cases and regain sovereignty over key services. “I came to this issue as both a researcher and a learner, but just in this last year, I knew three of the women who have gone missing or were murdered — and we shared so much in common,” said Blythe George, a Yurok tribal member who consults on a project documenting the problem. “You can’t help but see yourself in those people.” ___ The recent cases spotlight an epidemic that is difficult to quantify but has long disproportionately plagued Native Americans. A 2021 report by a government watchdog found the true number of missing and murdered Indigenous women is unknown due to reporting problems, distrust of law enforcement and jurisdictional conflicts. But Native women face murder rates almost three times those of white women overall — and up to 10 times the national average in certain locations, according to a 2021 summary of the existing research by the National Congress of American Indians. More than 80% have experienced violence. In this area peppered with illegal marijuana farms and defined by wilderness, almost everyone knows someone who has vanished. Missing person posters flutter from gas station doors and road signs. Even the tribal police chief isn’t untouched: He took in the daughter of one missing woman, and Emmilee — an enrolled Hoopa Valley tribal member with Yurok and Karuk blood — babysat his children. In California alone, the Yurok Tribe and the Sovereign Bodies Institute, an Indigenous-run research and advocacy group, uncovered 18 cases of missing or slain Native American women in roughly the past year — a number they consider a vast undercount. An estimated 62% of those cases are not listed in state or federal databases for missing persons. Hupa citizen Brandice Davis attended school with the daughters of a woman who disappeared in 1991 and now has daughters of her own, ages 9 and 13. “Here, we’re all related, in a sense,” she said of the place where many families are connected by marriage or community ties. She cautions her daughters about what it means to be female, Native American and growing up on a reservation: “You’re a statistic. But we have to keep going. We have to show people we’re still here.” ___ Like countless cases involving Indigenous women, Emmilee’s disappearance has gotten no attention from the outside world. But many here see in her story the ugly intersection of generations of trauma inflicted on Native Americans by their white colonizers, the marginalization of Native peoples and tribal law enforcement’s lack of authority over many crimes committed on their land. Virtually all of the area’s Indigenous residents, including Emmilee, have ancestors who were shipped to boarding schools as children and forced to give up their language and culture as part of a federal assimilation campaign. Further back, Yurok people spent years away from home as indentured servants for colonizers, said Judge Abby Abinanti, the tribe’s chief judge. The trauma caused by those removals echoes among the Yurok in the form of drug abuse and domestic violence, which trickles down to the youth, she said. About 110 Yurok children are in foster care. “You say, ‘OK, how did we get to this situation where we’re losing our children?’” said Abinanti. “There were big gaps in knowledge, including parenting, and generationally those play out.” An analysis of cases by the Yurok and Sovereign Bodies found most of the region’s missing women had either been in foster care themselves or had children taken from them by the state. An analysis of jail bookings also showed Yurok citizens in the two-county region are 11 times more likely to go to jail in a given year — and half those arrested are female, usually for low-level crimes. That’s an arrest rate for Yurok women roughly five times the rate of female incarcerations nationwide, said George, the University of California, Merced sociologist consulting with the tribe. The Yurok run a tribal wellness court for addiction and operate one of the country’s only state-certified tribal domestic violence perpetrator programs. They also recently hired a tribal prosecutor, another step toward building an Indigenous justice system that would ultimately handle all but the most serious felonies. The Yurok also are working to reclaim supervision over foster care and hope to transfer their first foster family from state court within months, said Jessica Carter, the Yurok Tribal Court director. A tribal-run guardianship court follows another 50 children who live with relatives. The long-term plan — mostly funded by grants — is a massive undertaking that will take years to accomplish, but the Yurok see regaining sovereignty over these systems as the only way to end the cycle of loss that’s taken the greatest toll on their women. “If we are successful, we can use that as a gift to other tribes to say, ‘Here’s the steps we took,’” said Rosemary Deck, the newly hired tribal prosecutor. “‘You can take this as a blueprint and assert your own sovereignty.’” ___ Emmilee was born into a prominent Native family, and a bright future beckoned. Starting at a young age, she was groomed to one day lead the intricate dances that knit the modern-day people to generations of tradition nearly broken by colonization. Her family, a “dance family,” has the rare distinction of owning enough regalia that it can outfit the brush, jump and flower dances without borrowing a single piece. At 15, Emmilee paraded down the National Mall with other tribal members at the opening of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian. The Washington Post published a front-page photo of her in a Karuk dress of dried bear grass, a woven basket cap and a white leather sash adorned with Pileated woodpecker scalps. The straight-A student earned a scholarship to the University of Oregon, where she helped lead a prominent Native students' group. Her success, however, was darkened by the first sign of trouble: an abusive relationship with a Native man whom, her mother believes, she felt she could save through her positive influence. Later, Emmilee dated another man, became pregnant and returned home to have the baby before finishing her degree. She then worked with disadvantaged Native families and eventually got accepted into a master’s program. She helped coach her son’s T-ball team and signed him up for swim lessons. But over time, her family says, they noticed changes. Emmilee was uncharacteristically tardy for work and grew more combative. She often dropped off her son with family, and she fell in with another abusive boyfriend. Her son was removed from her care when he was 5; a girl born in 2020 was taken away as a newborn as Emmilee’s behavior deteriorated. Her parents remain bewildered by her rapid decline and think she developed a mental illness — possibly postpartum psychosis — compounded by drugs and the trauma of domestic abuse. At first, she would see a doctor or therapist at her family’s insistence but eventually rebuffed all help. After her daughter’s birth, Emmilee spiraled rapidly, “like a light switched,” and she began to let go of the Native identity that had been her defining force, said her sister, Mary. “That was her life, and when you let that go, when you don’t have your kids ... what are you?” she said. ___ In the months before she vanished, Emmilee was frequently seen walking naked in public, talking to herself. She was picked up many times by sheriff’s deputies and tribal police but never charged. The only in-patient psychiatric facility within 300 miles (480 kilometers) was always too full to admit her. Once, she was taken to the emergency room and fled barefoot in her hospital gown. “People tended to look the other way. They didn’t really help her. In less than 24 hours, she was just back on the street, literally on the street,” said Judy Risling, her mother. “There were just no services for her.” In September, Emmilee was arrested after she was found dancing around a small fire in the Hoopa Valley Reservation cemetery. Then-Hoopa Valley Tribal Police Chief Bob Kane appeared in a Humboldt County court by video and explained her repeated police contacts and mental health problems. Emmilee mumbled during the hearing then shouted out that she didn’t set the fire. She was released with an order to appear again in 12 days after her public defender argued she had no criminal convictions and the court couldn’t hold her on the basis of her mental health. Then, Emmilee disappeared. “We had predicted that something like this may ... happen in the future,” said Kane. “And you know, now we’re here.” ____ If Emmilee fell through the cracks before she went missing, she has become even more invisible in her absence. One of the biggest hurdles in Indian Country once a woman is reported missing is unraveling a confusing jumble of federal, state, local and tribal agencies that must coordinate. Poor communication and oversights can result in overlooked evidence or delayed investigations. The problem is more acute in rural regions like the one where Emmilee disappeared, said Abigail Echo-Hawk, citizen of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute in Seattle. “Particularly in reservations and in village areas, there is a maze of jurisdictions, of policies, of procedures of who investigates what,” she said. Moreover, many cases aren’t logged in federal missing persons databases, and medical examiners sometimes misclassify Native women as white or Asian, said Gretta Goodwin, of the U.S. Government Accountability Office’s homeland security and justice team. Recent efforts at the state and federal level  seek to address what advocates say have been decades of neglect regarding missing and murdered Indigenous women. Former President Donald Trump signed a bill that required federal, state, tribal and local law enforcement agencies to create or update their protocols for handling such cases. And in November, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to set up guidelines between the federal government and tribal police that would help track, solve and prevent crimes against all Native Americans. A number of states, including California, Oregon, Washington and Arizona, are also taking on the crisis with greater funding to tribes, studies of the problem or proposals to create Amber Alert-style notifications. ___ Emmilee’s case illustrates some of the challenges. She was a citizen of the Hoopa Valley Tribe and was arrested on its reservation, but she is presumed missing on the neighboring Yurok Tribe’s reservation. The Yurok police are in charge of the missing persons probe, but the Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office will decide when to declare the case cold, which could trigger federal help. The remote terrain where Emmilee was last seen — two hours from the nearest town — created hurdles common on reservations. Law enforcement determined there wasn’t enough information to launch a formal search and rescue operation in such a vast, mountainous area. The Yurok police opted to forgo their own search because of liability concerns and a lack of training, said Yurok Tribal Police Chief Greg O’Rourke. Instead, Yurok and Hoopa Valley police and sheriff’s deputies plied the rain-swollen Klamath River by boat and drove back roads. Emmilee’s father, Gary Risling, says the sheriff’s office failed to act on anonymous tips, was slow to follow up on possible sightings and focused more resources on other missing person’s cases, including a wayward hunter and a kayaker lost at sea. “I don’t want to seem like I’m picking on them, but that effort is sure not put forward when it becomes a missing Indian woman,” he said. Humboldt County Sheriff William Honsal declined interview requests, saying the Yurok are in charge and there are no signs of foul play. O’Rourke said the tips aren’t enough for a search warrant and there’s nothing further the tribal police can do. The police chief, who knew Emmilee well, says his work is frequently stymied by a broader system that discounts tribal sovereignty. “The role of police is protect the vulnerable. As tribal police, we’re doing that in a system that’s broken,” he said. “I think that is the reason that Native women get all but dismissed.” Emmilee’s family, meanwhile, is struggling to shield her children, now 10 and almost 2, from the trauma of their mother’s disappearance — trauma they worry could trigger another generational cycle of loss. The boy has been having nightmares and recently spoke everyone’s worst fear. “It’s real difficult when you deal with the grandkids, and the grandkid says, ‘Grandpa, can you take me down the river and can we look for my mama?’ What do you tell him? ‘We’re looking, we’re looking every day,’” said Gary Risling, choking back tears. “And then he says, ‘What happens if we can’t find her?’” ____ Associated Press video journalist Manuel Valdes in Seattle contributed to this report. ___ Follow Gillian Flaccus on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/gflaccus",U.S./Associated Press,Tribe grapples with missing women crisis on California coast,https://news.yahoo.com/california-tribe-confronts-crisis-missing-050750665.html

China said it had to act after the latest deal undermined ""peace and stability"" in the region. It regards the island as a breakaway province that must accept Chinese sovereignty. Beijing has never renounced the possibility of using force to achieve that goal. Over the past two years it has stepped up military and diplomatic pressure on the island's government.

2/22/2022,"An American au pair working in Paris said ""Emily in Paris"" gets some things right but a lot wrong. Ayana Smith told Insider the Netflix show uses stereotypes and a ""distorted image"" of the locals. She said a relatable aspect of the show is Emily's struggle with the French language. An Arizonian au pair who lives in Paris and makes TikTok videos about her career said ""Emily in Paris"" gets little right about living in the French capital. Ayana Smith, 23, who currently has over 40,000 followers on TikTok, said she started making videos in June, weeks before completing her degree in psychology and family services and becoming an au pair. She told Insider she got the job through the agency Rome Abroad, which placed her and gave her informal training. After three months in Italy from late June, she said she began working for a family in the suburbs of Paris in October 2021, who pays her €100, or around $114, a week for child-minding services. Aside from her monthly salary of €400, or around $455, which she said is low but ""1,000% worth it,"" the hosts cover her accommodation in their family home, home-cooked meals which she can eat with them or alone, her phone bill, and a Navigo travel pass for all forms of transport, she said. In a TikTok video shared on January 20, which has over 8,300 views at the time of reporting, Smith wrote: ""Everyone: Emily in Paris is so unrealistic, nobody actually lives like that,"" before showing a compilation of herself shopping, eating, and partying. The caption says: ""I'm lying but it's still a great time lol."" When asked if she really can relate to the Netflix character — a young social-media marketing professional portrayed by Lily Collins who unexpectedly moves from Chicago to Paris — Smith said there were some applicable moments but she thought it was broadly inaccurate. ""I definitely relate to Emily in the sense that I had never taken a French class before moving to Paris,"" she said, adding that she also struggled to grasp the ""difficult"" language, and understand French humor. Smith also said the show represents French people with ""the stereotypes that you typically hear about,"" such as being unfriendly or rude. ""I have met so many nice French people but in the show, you really don't get to see a lot of that,"" Smith said. ""I just think that it shows a really distorted image of Parisians."" In October 2020, when the first season appeared on Netflix, French people criticized the show for what they felt was a superficial depiction of their culture, as reported by 20 Minutes, a free daily newspaper in France. ""The berets. The croissants. The baguettes. The hostile waiters. The irascible concierges. The inveterate philanderers. The lovers and the mistresses. Name a cliche about France and the French, you'll find it in Emily in Paris,"" wrote Fabien Randanne, a culture journalist at 20 Minutes. Smith told Insider that the show acts out the ""fantasy"" of what moving to Europe is like, rather than the reality. ""Emily's life is the life that Americans dream of when they think of an American living in Paris,"" she said, adding that her experience has been quite different. Speaking to Cosmopolitan's Emma Baty in a story published in October 2020, Lucas Bravo, who plays Gabriel in the show, said he understands criticism that it offers a limited view of Paris, but that it couldn't possibly show everything. ""I think they're right, in a way. We're portraying cliches and we're portraying one single vision of Paris. Paris is one of the most diverse cities in the world,"" he told Baty, adding that it's home to many different nationalities and neighborhoods.

2/22/2022,"(Reuters) -Police in Portland, Oregon, said they believe a shooting that left one woman dead and five people wounded at a protest over police violence on Saturday night was triggered by a clash between an armed homeowner and armed demonstrators. The shooting took place as people gathered in northeast Portland on Saturday to protest the death of Amir Locke, the 22-year-old fatally shot earlier this month by law enforcement in Minneapolis during a no-knock apartment raid. The Portland Police Bureau said in a statement on Sunday that a preliminary investigation indicated the incident ""started with a confrontation between an armed homeowner and armed protesters"" but that detectives were still struggling to gather evidence. In an online briefing on Sunday afternoon, department spokesperson Nathan Sheppard said detectives believe numerous people either saw the shooting or recorded it on their phones but have not cooperated with police. The police said they found one woman dead when they arrived at the scene in the Rose City Park neighborhood on Saturday night. They have not identified the deceased or the five wounded people who were taken to area hospitals for treatment. Protesters at Normandale Park were getting ready to march when a man who lives close by confronted them and later opened fire, striking multiple people, the Oregonian reported on Sunday, citing a source with direct knowledge of the investigation. The Portland-based newspaper said that at least one protester shot back at the man who had opened fire. Of the five wounded in the incident, the man is one of three people who suffered life-threatening injuries, the newspaper said. The police believe the man acted alone and is not affiliated with any political group, the Oregonian said. The protester who shot back at the man was initially arrested on assault and weapons charges but will likely be released and the charges dropped, the newspaper said. During the news briefing, Sheppard declined to offer any details on the investigation, including whether anyone has been arrested in connection with the shooting. Pressed on why he would not confirm or deny an arrest, Shepperd said it would be ""irresponsible"" due to the ""complicated"" nature of the incident. Portland was rocked by months of anti-racism protests following the death of George Floyd, an African-American who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes in May 2020. The city has also been a magnet for clashes between political extremists, with violent skirmishes breaking out between people associated with the far-right Proud Boys and members of antifa, the loosely organized anti-fascist movement. Like many other big U.S. cities, Portland has seen a spike in murders over the past two years, a phenomenon experts have attributed partly to the social disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

2/22/2022,"Donald Trump launched Truth Social on Monday, but the app and its rollout did not go without their quirks. Truth Social mimics Twitter’s layout, and is aimed at providing a platform for conservative voices who feel their freedom of speech is not upheld by Twitter, Facebook-now-Meta and other channels. The influx of signups for Truth Social has created a waiting list at least 150,000, CNN reported. Truth Social is available on the Apple App Store, but not for Androids or users outside of the country. The reaction to Trump’s newest venture was not muted on Twitter. “The irony – the ‘Truthers’ are all on Twitter looking for customer service,” one user tweeted. Several reports of bugs, hiccups in the sign up process and ultimately restricted boundaries for downloading the app brought many to scrutinize its development and overall operation. “Social media sadly thrives on conflict,” wrote Lt. Colonel Adam Kinzinger on Twitter. “#truthsocial (which is ironically named) will be boring and fail, because it will be all Trump-fed drones. BUT, please don’t come back to real social media if you left for Trump and Nunes great idea. You get your one shot.” Congressman Ted Lieu mused about the inner workings of the platform, Tweeting, “Many people say that if #TruthSocial can’t even handle opening new accounts, how will it keep your account from being hacked? Also, the problems won’t be fixed until late March. So is their staff like 2 people, the failed Devin Nunes and his cousin’s friend who is the coder?” Many people say that if #TruthSocial can’t even handle opening new accounts, how will it keep your account from being hacked?Also, the problems won’t be fixed until late March. So is their staff like 2 people, the failed Devin Nunes and his cousin’s friend who is the coder? https://t.co/9aZq5ywHna — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) February 21, 2022 Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene joined Truth Social the day before its launch to the public. “As the only Member of Congress to have had my personal @Twitter account banned, I understand what millions of conservatives have gone through having their personal freedom of speech stolen from them by Big Tech for not parroting the approved messaging,” Greene tweeted. Richard Grennel retweeted one of his earlier Tweets, writing “It’s an overwhelming success. The demand is YUGE. Be patient.” Politician Jon Cooper commented on the slow launch of the app. “Don’t worry, Walter. I would NEVER leave Trump’s new TRUTH Social app a 1 star review. And I’d definitely NEVER write ‘bugs’ in the review,” Cooper tweeted. “Since I know that could cause Apple to remove it from the app store. That would be so wrong. ” Some are comparing the launch to Trump steaks, a project the former president took on back in 2016 that flopped. The operation doubled back on itself when put under investigation, as it looked like Trump was buying steaks and repackaging them as his own for higher prices.

2/22/2022,"SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea's Kim Jong Un vowed to strengthen cooperation with China and together ""frustrate"" threats and hostile policies from the United States and its allies, state media reported on Tuesday. Kim made the remarks in a verbal message to Chinese President Xi Jinping, congratulating him on the successful completion of the Beijing Olympics, state news agency KCNA said in a summary. North Korea and China are defending and advancing socialism, while ""frustrating the undisguised hostile policy and military threat of the U.S. and its satellite forces"" by strengthening strategic cooperation and unity, Kim said. Kim praised the Games for making a mark on history, and said under Xi's leadership, China had persevered in the face of an ""unprecedentedly severe health crisis and the hostile forces' maneuvers."" North Korea did not participate in the Games, which ended on Sunday. In a previous letter from sports authorities in January, North Korea blamed ""hostile forces"" and COVID-19 risks for its not being able to attend. North Korean athletes were not eligible to compete under their national flag after the country failed to send a team to the Tokyo Summer Olympics last year, citing COVID-19 concerns.

2/22/2022,"EXCLUSIVE: Explicit Los Angeles jailhouse recordings of Hannah Tubbs, the 26-year-old trans child molester who received a slap on the wrist last month after pleading guilty to molesting a 10-year-old in 2014, depict her admitting it was wrong to attack a little girl but gloating over the light punishment. She boasted that nothing would happen to her after she pleaded guilty due to Democrat District Attorney George Gascon's policies and laughed that she won't have to go back to prison or register as a sex offender. She also made explicit remarks about the victim that are unfit to print. ""I’m gonna plead out to it, plead guilty,"" Tubbs says in one recording. ""They’re gonna stick me on probation, and it’s gonna be dropped, it’s gonna be done, I won’t have to register, won’t have to do nothing."" CALIFORNIA TRANS CHILD MOLESTER, 26, GETS 2 YEARS IN JUVENILE FACILITY THANKS TO PROGRESSIVE DA GEORGE GASCON ""You won’t have to register?"" her father asks on the other line later in the conversation. ""I won’t have to do none of that,"" Tubbs replies. ""So what are they going to do to you then?"" ""Nothing,"" Tubbs answers, then laughs. Tubbs pleaded guilty last month to the cold case attack, which took place in women’s restroom at a Denny’s restaurant, when the suspect was two weeks shy of 18 and identified as a male named James Tubbs. After being arrested roughly eight years after the crime, Tubbs began identifying as a woman, according to prosecutors. She received a sentence of two years at a juvenile facility because Gascon’s office declined to transfer the case to adult court, adhering to one of the progressive prosecutor’s day-one directives barring ""children"" from being tried as adults. She could serve as little as six months and won’t have to register as a sex offender. LOS ANGELES COUNTY DA GEORGE GASCON BACKPEDALS ON PROGRESSIVE DIRECTIVES AMID CRIME WAVE, PUBLIC BLOWBACK Tubbs’ victim, who was 10 at the time of the attack, told Fox News Digital that Gascon’s handling of the case has been ""insulting"" and ""unfair"" to her. ""The things he did to me and made me do that day was beyond horrible for a ten-year-old girl to have to go through,"" she said. ""I want him tried as an adult for the crimes he committed against me."" She said the light sentence was offensive and hurtful and offered her ""no true justice."" ""I’ve also heard that my attacker goes by she/them pronouns now,"" she added. ""I see it also unfair to try him as a woman as well, seeing how he clearly didn’t act like one on January 1st of 2014."" LA PROSECUTOR BLASTS POLICY CHANGE AMID CONTROVERSY OVER TRANS CHILD MOLESTER CASE In one of the calls, Tubbs asks the caller to start using female pronouns. ""So now they're going to put me with other trannies that have seen their cases like mine or with one tranny like me that has a case like mine,"" Tubbs says. ""So when you come to court, make sure you address me as her."" Then she says that if she goes to prison she’s getting a sex change surgery to go into the women's facility, and the other person says, ""There's some b---es in there too."" Gascon issued a statement Sunday addressing the case. ""Like every responsible office, we learn as we go, take feedback from the community, and make necessary adjustments based on our experiences and the complex nature of this work,"" he said, adding that ""a small number of cases"" necessitate flexibility denied to his prosecutors under his edicts. CALIFORNIA BILL WOULD ALLOW CITIZENS TO ENFORCE GUN BAN, MODELED AFTER TEXAS HEARTBEAT LAW ""Specifically, we learned a lot from the Hannah Tubbs case about the need for a policy safety valve,"" Gascon said. He also admitted that Tubbs went on after the 2014 attack to commit other offenses – including one in which DNA evidence linked her to the Denny’s assault. ""Ms. Tubbs had several charges in other counties after the juvenile offense but never received any services which both her past behavior and that subsequent to her arrest demonstrates she clearly needs,"" Gascon said. ""After her sentencing in our case, I became aware of extremely troubling statements she made about her case, the resolution of it and the young girl that she harmed."" The recordings, however, were made in November, and sources tell Fox News Digital that prosecutors were well aware of them. Last Wednesday, Gascon’s chief deputy Sharon Woo sent a memo to prosecutors back off a blanket ban on seeking to try juveniles in adult court. At the time, Gascon’s office denied the move had any connection to the Tubbs case and instead said the change came as prosecutors await a series of state Supreme Court decisions that are expected to send multiple cases back to Los Angeles. Then on Friday, in a series of five memos sent to staff, Gascon backpedaled on his other directives, saying exceptions could be made to once again bring charges that would carry sentences of life without parole and allow juveniles to be tried in adult court. He will continue to block his office from seeking the death penalty. Gascon conceded that he’d come to accept his policies were too rigid ""after listening to the community, victims and colleagues.""",U.S./Fox News,California trans child molester Hannah Tubbs gloats over light sentence in jailhouse phone calls,https://news.yahoo.com/california-trans-child-molester-hannah-165449299.html
2/22/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russian “peacekeeping” troops to the pro-Kremlin regions of Luhansk and Donetsk after unilaterally declaring that the two chunks of Eastern Ukraine should be considered independent states. The dramatic escalation, which many fear could lead to all-out war, followed an address to his nation on Monday, in which the Russian president formally announced “the immediate recognition” of the pro-Kremlin regions of Luhansk and Donetsk—which stretch over 6,500 miles—as independent of Ukraine. In a decree released shortly after his speech, the president ordered Russia's defense ministry to “ensure ….. implementation by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation of functions to maintain peace on the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic.” Reuters later reported that Putin had prepared treaties with leaders of the so-called independent states, granting Russia the right to build military bases therein. Before his formal recognition of the break-away states, Putin had spent the better part of his address lambasting Ukraine, NATO, and the U.S. for failing to address “security threats” raised by the Kremlin in recent months. He baselessly accused Ukrainian forces of perpetuating “genocide” and blamed Kyiv for any future “continuation of bloodshed” in those regions. President Putin has authorized Russian Forces to move into the Donbas Region and to begin Peacekeeping Activities, the first Division of Russian Peacekeepers have already crossed the border into the Area. pic.twitter.com/NPaCG0rNma — OSINTdefender (@sentdefender) February 21, 2022 “If Ukraine was to join NATO it would serve as a direct threat to the security of Russia,” the Russian leader said. He undermined Ukraine as a country that has “never had a tradition of genuine statehood,” accused the U.S. of “blackmailing” Russia with threats of sanctions, and warned of Western efforts “to try to convince us over and over again that NATO is a peace-loving and purely defensive alliance,” adding, “we know the real value of such words.” Though Putin did not directly address growing fears that Russia is planning to invade Ukraine, he appeared to be laying the groundwork for war by characterizing a potential Russian military offensive as an act of self-defense. Moscow “has every right to take retaliatory measures to ensure its own security,” he said. That is exactly what we will do.” The move follows a spectacularly bizarre meeting by Russia’s Security Council, where Putin appeared like a mob boss testing his underlings, as officials, one after another, spoke out in favor of recognizing the self-proclaimed republics. Mysterious ‘Z’ Painted on Russian Tanks Closing in on Ukraine Border It was another grotesque spectacle on a day when the drum beats of war grew deafening. The aggressive and totally unjustified territorial claim followed a series of apparent false-flag operations where the Russians tried to blame Ukrainian forces for a number of attacks. The Russian military claimed that five so-called “saboteurs” were assassinated early Monday after crossing into Russia from Ukraine. The report mirrors almost exactly what the Biden administration warned could be “false flags” or trigger points that Russia will respond to as a pretext to launch its invasion. “As a result of clashes, five people who violated the Russian border from a group of saboteurs were killed,” the Russian military said in a statement, according to Reuters. No Russians died in the alleged border infraction. Russia also said Ukraine had destroyed a border outpost used by the FSB (Federal Security Service) in early morning shelling. Russia has also claimed in recent days that Ukrainian forces are staging attacks on Luhansk and Donetsk. Ukraine has denied any such incursion or attacks took place. The Minister of Foreign affairs, Dmytro Kuleba, took to Twitter Monday to dismiss the claims with big red ‘X’s denying an attack on Donetsk or Luhansk, or that it sent saboteurs over the Russian border, or that it shelled Russian territory or border crossings. The recognition of the two separatist territories in #Ukraine is a blatant violation of international law, the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the #Minsk agreements.The EU and its partners will react with unity, firmness and with determination in solidarity with Ukraine. — Josep Borrell Fontelles (@JosepBorrellF) February 21, 2022 After the latest round of supposed Ukrainian aggression, the leaders of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics published video appeals pleading with Putin to recognize their independence, as they claimed Ukrainian forces were preparing to attack. Despite a flurry of last-minute attempts at diplomacy—including talk of a summit between presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin—all hell seems soon to break loose in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an address to the nation that the country was prepared for any outcome. “We are committed to the peaceful and diplomatic path, we will follow it and only it,” he said. “But we are on our own land, we are not afraid of anything and anybody, we owe nothing to no one, and we will give nothing to no one.” Referring not to Moscow but to the prospect of assistance from the West, he added, “It’s important right now to see who our true friends are.” The U.N. Security Council met for an emergency session on Monday evening, with Ukraine’s envoy to the world body expressing frustration that no action would be taken. Russia, after all, has veto power on the Council. “The United Nations is sick. That's a matter of fact. It’s been hit by the virus spread by Kremlin,” Sergiy Kyslytsya said. Monday, Biden’s national security advisor Jake Sullivan warned that Russia’s imminent attack on Ukraine will be “extremely violent” and that it could begin literally at any moment. “We believe that any military operation of this size, scope and magnitude of what we believe the Russians are planning will be extremely violent,” he told NBC Today show on a frenzied circuit of morning TV on President’s Day. “It will cost the lives of Ukrainians and Russians, civilians and military personnel alike.” He told the network that new intelligence garnered in recent days suggest “an even greater form of brutality because this will not simply be some conventional war between two armies.” He went on to say Russia will target the Ukrainian people “to repress them, to crush them, to harm them.” He then appeared on ABC Good Morning America, telling them that “all signs look like President Putin and the Russians are proceeding with a plan to execute a major military invasion of Ukraine.” That plan was bolstered over the weekend with Russian military hardware painted with an ominous white “Z” lettering rolling toward strategic points along the Ukrainian frontier. “We have seen just in the last 24 hours further moves of Russian units to the border with no other good explanation other than they’re getting in position to attack.” The National Security Advisor to President Biden, @jakejsullivan, joins us to discuss the Ukraine crisis. pic.twitter.com/xaWogFyPID — TODAY (@TODAYshow) February 21, 2022 Over the weekend, French President Emmanuel Macron invited Biden and Putin to a summit, which Biden signaled he would attend on the condition that Russian not invade Ukraine, but the Kremlin called reports of any such meeting “premature.” As Sullivan reiterated that any attack on Ukraine would be met with the “full force of American and Allied might,” unsubstantiated news reports of ceasefire infractions along the border continue unabated.

2/22/2022,"The Latest on the Russia-Ukraine crisis (all times local): ___ UNITED NATIONS — Russia’s U.N. ambassador has accused the United States and its Western allies of egging Ukraine toward “an armed provocation.” Speaking at an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Monday night, Vassily Nebenzia accused Ukraine of sharply increasing shelling in residential areas of the separatist Luhansk and Donetsk regions and in Russian towns and villages near the border. He said Ukraine has concentrated a 120,000-strong military contingent along the contact line with pro-Russian separatists in the east and “subversive groups” have penetrated or tried to penetrate the territory known as the Donbas to sabotage critical infrastructure. “So it has become clear that Donbas is on the brink of a new Ukrainian military adventure as was already the case in 2014 and 2015,” he said. Nebenzia said that’s why President Vladimir Putin announced earlier Monday that Russia will recognize Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states and is putting Russian troops into the two states as peacekeepers. The separatist authorities said Monday that at least four civilians were killed by Ukrainian shelling over the past 24 hours, and several others were wounded. Ukraine’s military said two Ukrainian soldiers were killed over the weekend, and another serviceman was wounded Monday. Ukrainian military spokesman Pavlo Kovalchyuk insisted that Ukrainian forces weren’t returning fire. Nebenzia said Russia was open to diplomacy but wouldn't allow “a new bloodbath in the Donbas,” urging the United States and other Western nations to not worsen the situation. ___ SEOUL, South Korea – South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Tuesday issued support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territory amid fears of an imminent invasion by Russia and called for related nations to resolve the situation through dialogue. In an emergency meeting with national security and economic officials, Moon instructed them to prepare for the economic fallout in South Korea if the Ukraine crisis is prolonged and the U.S.-led West imposes stringent economic sanctions on Russia. Moon during the part of his comments released to the media didn’t directly criticize Russia. But he noted that the United States and other Western nations have condemned Russian plans to deploy troops in separatist areas of eastern Ukraine as a violation of international law and an infringement of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territory. “Ukraine’s sovereignty and territory must be respected,” Moon added. “It would not be ideal if the situation in Ukraine worsens into a military clash against the wishes of the international community. That would bring huge ramifications in the politics and economy of not only Europe, but to the whole world.” ___ UNITED NATIONS — China has called for restraint and is encouraging every effort to find a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis, saying Beijing believes all countries should solve disputes by peaceful means in line with the U.N. Charter. China’s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun called on the key parties in the Ukraine dispute “to continue dialogue and consultation and seek reasonable solutions."" Zhang gave very brief remarks at an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Monday night called by Ukraine, the U.S. and six other countries following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Russia will recognize the separatist areas in eastern Ukraine as independent states and is putting Russian troops into Luhansk and Donetsk as peacekeepers. The Chinese ambassador made no mention of actions on Monday by its usual ally, Russia, saying only that “all parties concerned must exercise restraint, and avoid any action that may fuel tensions,” and to “welcome and encourage every effort for a diplomatic solution.” Chinese state media is reporting that China’s Embassy in Kyiv notified its citizens in Ukraine to heighten their safety awareness and avoid conflict areas. On Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said China hoped all parties would pursue a solution that is “truly conducive to safeguarding the security of Europe.” ___ TOKYO — Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida criticized Russia for violating Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity and said his country will discuss possible “severe actions” including sanctions with the international community. Kishida was responding to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s signing Monday of decree recognizing the independence of two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, ordering his troops to “maintain peace” in those areas. Putin’s announcement raised fears of an imminent invasion. “Those actions are unacceptable, and we express our strong condemnation,” Kishida told reporters Tuesday. “Japan is watching the development with grave concern.” Separately, Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said Tuesday it was important that Group of Seven nations that share values such as democracy and rule of law stick together and lead the international community. He declined to say if Japan is planning its own sanctions against Russia. ___ UNITED NATIONS — The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations has dismissed “as nonsense” Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcement that he is putting Russian troops in separatist areas of eastern Ukraine as peacekeepers, saying their presence is “clearly the basis for Russia’s attempt to create a pretext for a further invasion of Ukraine.” Linda Thomas-Greenfield told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Monday night that this move and Putin’s earlier announcement that Russia will recognize the separatist areas as “independent states” are also an “unprovoked” attack on Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. By his actions, she said, Putin “has torn the Minsk Agreement to shreds.” Thomas-Greenfield said Putin “has put before the world a choice” and it “must not look away” because “history tells us that looking the other way in the face of such hostility will be a far more costly path.” She said Putin is testing to see “how far he can push us all,” and all countries must stand up for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries. Thomas-Greenfield warned that “the consequences of Russia’s actions will be dire — across Ukraine, across Europe, and across the globe.” ___ WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta said there was no basis under international law for recognizing the separatist regions, and that by doing so Russia was further undermining Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. “We are concerned that this is a calculated act by President Putin to create a pretext for invasion, which would be a clear act of aggression. We again call for urgent diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful resolution,” Mahuta said in a statement. ___ UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. political chief has opened an emergency meeting of the Security Council, calling Russia’s recognition of separatist areas in Ukraine’s east a violation of the country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Undersecretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo said that “the risk of major conflict is real and needs to be prevented at all costs.” DiCarlo told Monday’s rare nighttime meeting of the U.N.’s most powerful body — a reflection of the seriousness of Moscow’s action — that everyone involved should focus on ending hostilities immediately. She said the United Nations regretted Russia’s order to deploy Russian troops into eastern Ukraine and expressed deep concern at reports of civilian casualties, the targeting of civilian infrastructure, and escalating shelling between government-controlled areas and the Russian-backed separatists. Monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe recorded 3,231 cease-fire violations in the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine from Friday to Sunday, she said. ___ TRIABUNNA, Australia — Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Russia should “unconditionally withdraw” from Ukrainian territory and cease to threaten its neighbors. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered forces Monday to “maintain peace” in separatist regions of eastern Ukraine, hours after the Kremlin recognized the area’s independence. The announcement raised fears that an invasion was imminent, if not already underway. Morrison at a news conference Tuesday in Australia's Tasmania state said Russia’s actions were “unacceptable, it’s unprovoked, it’s unwarranted.” “It is important that like-minded countries who denounce this sort of behavior do stick together and I can assure you that the moment that other countries put in place strong and severe sanctions on Russia, we will be in lockstep with them and we will be moving just as quickly and that is what their discussions that we have been engaged with now for some time with our partners,” he said. The Kremlin decree left unclear when, or whether, troops would enter Ukraine. But it brought swift promises of new sanctions and underscored the steep challenges of staving off a military conflict.",World/Associated Press,The Latest: Russia says West egging Ukraine toward conflict,https://news.yahoo.com/latest-australian-pm-says-russia-013653987.html

Calvin Crew, 22, was arrested and charged Feb. 17 with criminal homicide, robbery and tampering with evidence in the death of Christina Spicuzza, 38, who was reported missing by her family six days earlier after she did not return home following a shift of Uber fares. When Spicuzza picked up Crew as a passenger for an Uber ride on the night of Feb. 10, he pulled a gun on her, according to a criminal complaint filed in Pittsburgh Municipal Court. In dashcam footage, Spicuzza tells her assailant, ""Come on, I have a family ... I'm begging you, I have four kids,"" according to the complaint.

She died of a single gunshot wound to the head, according to Allegheny County police. ""It was a senseless killing that left four children without a mother. My heart breaks for Christina's children and her family,"" Victor Joseph, Allegheny County police assistant superintendent, said at a news conference Friday. Authorities tried to determine what may have been stolen from Spicuzza and whether Crew's girlfriend will face criminal charges for ordering the Uber on his behalf. In response to the incident, an Uber spokesperson told USA TODAY on Sunday the company banned the accounts for the person who ordered the trip and the suspect. ""No family should have to suffer such an unimaginable loss and our thoughts are with Christi’s loved ones during this difficult time,"" Uber said in a statement. ""We’ve been in touch with law enforcement to support the investigation and are grateful for everything they’ve done.” There no reason to believe Crew and Spicuzza knew each other, police said. ""In my experience, this is unusual in Alleghany County ... thankfully, it doesn't happen that often,"" Joseph said. ""More times than not, there is a relationship between the actor and victim. In this situation, we do not know of any.""

2/22/2022,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong authorities said they found COVID-19 in samples taken from the packaging of imports of frozen beef from Brazil and frozen pork skin from Poland, vowing to step up inspections of imported food. The global financial hub deploys a ""dynamic zero COVID"" strategy similar to mainland China's, aiming to eradicate any outbreaks at all costs. Authorities have been on high alert as a new wave of infections is proving harder to control. Daily infections numbers have risen sharply this year, reaching a record 7,533 cases on Monday, overwhelming the government's testing, hospital and quarantine capacities. The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) took 36 samples for testing from a batch of around 1,100 cartons of frozen beef, weighing a total of 29 tonnes, imported from Brazil by sea. It found one outer packaging and two inner packaging samples tested positive. It also collected 12 samples from a batch of around 300 cartons of frozen pork skin, weighing around 7 tonnes, imported from Poland via sea. One inner packaging sample tested positive for COVID-19. ""The CFS has ordered the importers concerned to dispose the beef and pork skin of the same batches,"" the government said in a statement late on Monday. ""In addition, the CFS will step up the sampling of similar products for testing."" Hong Kong has been monitoring frozen food imports for COVID-19 since mid-2020 and found positive samples on pomfret fish packaging in August 2021 and on cuttlefish packaging in November 2021. Authorities said COVID-19 is predominantly transmitted through droplets and cannot multiply in food or food packaging, and that it is unlikely that it can be transmitted to humans via food consumption. Nevertheless, they recommend people handle raw food separately, observe hygiene rules and cook food thoroughly. With stepped up inspections on food imports, Hong Kong is again following in the footsteps of mainland China on COVID-19 policies. Unlike other countries, China cites frozen food packaging as a risk of spreading COVID-19. Mainland China had announced a number of cases of the virus being found on chilled food packaging, prompting rejections of goods and complaints from exporters. The World Health Organization says neither food nor packaging are known transmission routes.
