I plant her window box (sorry, I’m not yet quite ready for past tense). I sow calendula – of course – in her pots. We always buy her flowers, posh English tea and biscuits. This time, though, we walk past the pretty tins to check-in. Denmark is bathed in sun by the sea. My daughters Kala and Radha have come to offer Henri support. To help pack away Ina’s long life. To sort through her house and memories. I find myself buying too many packets of flower seed. I water. I hoe. I sow wild meadow, with lots of cornflowers, daisies. There is a box of wild blue lupin pods. The sort that line Scandinavian roads. I scatter far too many in the borders, the new flower bed. The poppy seed will wait till Easter when we return for a gathering with her sisters, neighbours and friends. Ina was a genius of jam. She recently trained Henri’s brother Jørn. We find blackcurrants in her freezer. He – and we – will make Ina’s favourite. We’ll buy more bushes from the plant nursery. Line them along the sunny side of the summerhouse. There is an early budding calendula outside her front door. From seed I sowed. It’s replanted now where the blackcurrant bushes will grow. Cheery summer orange among the melancholy. Henri finds a note her mother wrote after she’d told her we’d met, with exclamation marks. It’s now the weekend of our 30th anniversary. In the quiet evenings we walk together on the beach at sunset, Kala, Radha, Henriette, three extraordinary women honouring a beloved family pioneer. The badger tears the low bird feeders down. A hare loons around the garden. As we leave, the new autumn-planted daffodils join the primroses in bloom. Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now.

4/10/2022,"A taxpayer-funded charity that runs a prestigious art school in Rome has been accused of failing in its duty of care after allegations of mismanagement, a “toxic” working environment and unfair working practices. The British School at Rome (BSR) launched an inquiry after 24 staff, former employees and alumni complained about the charity’s operations in April 2020 to its trustees. It was alleged that staff were suffering “physical and mental health issues” because of poor working conditions. It is alleged a “grievance panel” set up by the charity’s trustees to investigate the claims was suspended before it reported its findings. The charity said last week it had conducted a “comprehensive, independent and confidential” investigation. BSR was established in 1901 and is housed in a neoclassical building in Rome designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. Alumni include Turner prize winners Elizabeth Price and Mark Wallinger. It receives more than half of its funding from the British Academy, which is supported by a grant from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. A two-page complaint written in April 2020 was sent to the charity’s council, whose members are its trustees. The council is chaired by Mark Getty, a member of the Getty family oil dynasty and co-founder of the media company Getty Images. The complaint seen by the Observer said there were grave concerns at the school with regard to mismanagement, unfair working practices and alleged demeaning language towards some female employees. The letter complained of a “toxic” and “divisive” working atmosphere. The document stated: “Since July 2019, a number of trustees have been approached and these issues have been brought to their attention, but nothing positive has resulted. People should be given the opportunity to speak in a safe and protected environment.” In one case of alleged unfair working conditions, a senior female arts researcher who lived at the school and has spoken to the Observer said she was expected to act as a “janitor” on some nights, and was given a torch and high-visibility vest to patrol the premises. She said: “I actually found a naked man in the lecture theatre one Saturday evening and I had to deal with that. I think he was on drugs.” When she complained that out-of-hours duties were not in her contract, she claims she was told she would not be granted her holiday leave unless she agreed to do the out-of-hours work. The researcher was dismissed after refusing to work out of hours, but says she pursued an unfair dismissal case in the Rome courts and received compensation in a settlement. The council overseeing the charity commissioned an independent review in June 2020. The panel recommended forming a grievance panel and also identified a “very urgent” need for staff to get access to human resources advice and support. A grievance panel composed solely of lawyers appointed by the BSR was conducted with hearings in July 2020. In September that year, 37 staff, former employees and alumni wrote to the British Academy, complaining they had not been informed of any findings by the panel and the charity had “failed in its duty of care”. The British Academy and the BSR reviewed the charity’s governance. Reforms were proposed, including a new code of conduct, the formation of a senior management team and a new approach to diversity and inclusion. The British Academy reported to the complainants in June 2021 that the council had “decided to suspend the operations of the grievance panel despite the absence of any resolution of the issues that came before it”. The charity, which has about 30 employees, said last week that all the review’s recommendations had been implemented. It said it could not fully respond to specific claims because of confidentiality arrangements, but no members of staff were the subject of disciplinary action. It said it consulted staff last summer about the grievance panel and the council concluded it was appropriate to consider the procedure closed. It said that no researchers had been asked to act as janitors, but residential staff had shared duties for out-of-hours emergencies. Since spring 2020, a professional security service had been in place, the charity said. An HR manager was appointed in 2021. Mark Getty, chair of the BSR council, said: “I am confident that with an enhanced framework for the BSR’s governance and with new dynamic leadership, the BSR is now well-placed to develop the UK’s creative and academic presence in Italy.” The British Academy said it was not in its remit to investigate specific complaints from employees, but said it was satisfied the issues identified in its governance review were “in hand”. Professor Stephen Milner, director of the charity at the time of the complaints, left at the end of his secondment in January 2021. Milner, Serena Professor of Italian at Manchester University, said last week the BSR would respond on the issue.",News/World news,Prestigious British art school in Rome accused of being a ‘toxic’ place to work,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/10/british-school-at-rome-art-school-accused-of-being-a-toxic-place-to-work
4/10/2022,"Five Little Pigs, 26 St Mary’s Street, Wallingford OX10 0ET (01491 833 999). Starters £3.50-£8.50, mains £12-£25, desserts £7-£8, wines from £22.50 It’s always good to acknowledge your weaknesses. I’m beginning to think melted cheese might be one of mine. The menu at Five Little Pigs, a well-dressed, smart little bistro in the Oxfordshire town of Wallingford, lists many interesting-sounding things among the starters: fried anchovies with sage and a bone-marrow aioli catch my eye, as does the scotch egg, enriched with haggis, alongside their own brown sauce. It lists among the snacks, deep-fried olives, stuffed with capers and marjoram. We get some of those to nibble on casually, like deep-fried olives are something we always do, while giving the menu the attention it deserves. They are golden, panko bread-crumbed, salty sour, quail egg-sized orbs of brackish loveliness. They are a good sign. It’s while I’m preparing to take another, that our waiter announces one of the specials: a toastie made with cheese from the nearby Nettlebed Creamery, plus apple and a few dandelion leaves, alongside a dandelion salad. I know immediately that this is going to happen, because it’s a toastie and I am literally incapable of saying no to one of those, even if I should. It’s the utterly domestic, made public. It’s booze food. It’s the thing you eat before going on the lash; the thing you eat while the blood alcohol is peaking, because it seems like a bloody good idea at the time, and always is; the thing you eat the morning after the night before. And now here it is being brought into the polite society of the restaurant, with a dandelion salad. It’s like your dissolute uncle, the outrageous one who never quite worked out where boundaries lay, but who nevertheless manages to comb their hair and put on a suit for a family wedding. But you know that underneath the sweet waft of dry-cleaning fluid and Paco Rabanne, it’s still him. Even as you shake your head at his behaviour, you know you’d be a little disappointed if he cleaned up his act. There is no elevated form of the cheese toastie; no, gastronomically evolved version. Sure, you can forage leaves from the hedgerows of Oxfordshire for the salad, and take care over the choice of cheese, but it still must be its rude, coarse self. The Five Little Pigs toastie is exactly that: golden and a little oily, and crusted in places with rich, salty cheese that has leaked out and made direct searing contact with the iron. The bright, lightly bitter salad does mitigate the richness, but if you didn’t want richness, you shouldn’t have bloody ordered a cheese toastie, should you? The only problem is that it’s so engrossing, so damn good, it might limit space for all the other good things on offer here. But hey: I have a job to do and I will damn well do it. I’ve trained at low altitude. Five Little Pigs, partly named after the nursery rhyme, and partly named after the novel by Agatha Christie, who lived in Wallingford, opened in May 2021, after a successful crowdfunder. It’s a partnership between the owners of The Keep, a local craft beer and gin bar, and the restaurateur Aimee Hunt, who also has Lata Lata in High Wycombe. They make much of their local sourcing, not just from the Nettlebed Creamery, but also fruit and veg from the Clays, a market garden just three miles away run by a former maths teacher, plus Dexter beef and Gloucester Old Spot pork from Blue Tin Produce, five miles away. All of this is a terrific story. It supports the local community and does mean greater transparency in the food chain, even if the claims about carbon sustainability may not bear massive scrutiny; the transport of food is far less important to its carbon footprint than how it’s raised. Certainly, none of this virtuous purchasing matters if the cooking isn’t up to scratch. Here, it really is. Alongside the toastie, which I might already have mentioned, we have the torched, oily mackerel, its skin properly blistered and burnt, with a buttercup-yellow whorl of aioli, and a pile of crisp pickled vegetables. We have slices of seared lamb heart, deep and crimson at the centre, with a few bitter leaves, a little blood orange dressing and a dollop of crunchy green relish. Among the mains is a dark, caramelised venison ragu, which must have started cooking the day before, or the day before that. Or the day before that. It comes on a big heap of soft, buttery polenta, whipped to within an inch of its life, and then lightly sprinkled by a grating of hard cheese, like a snow shower just passed through. No knife required. Fork it away. It’s the best kind of nourishing, invalid food, and supremely comforting even if you’re not under the weather. Another main of a trout fillet, the colour of orange sherbet, comes with fronds of chard, the stems a cheery deep red, slices of potato and a yoghurt dressing. If the venison ragu is designed to make the poorly feel better, the trout dish is just designed to make you feel better about yourself, whatever. It should come as no surprise that, after all the hot cheese toastie action, dessert space is limited. Here, it’s all about rice pudding and ginger cake, and a dark chocolate delice with more of the blood orange that turned up with the lamb hearts. We just about manage to share their big, sugar-crusted doughnut, the winter jam filling of which alters depending on what’s most available. Today it’s rhubarb and there’s a little cardamom-flavoured custard on the side. It feels like another domestic dish brought out into the world of the restaurant. It’s an appropriate bookend to lunch. Pricing for this quality of cooking, with starters firmly in single digits and most of the mains in the mid-teens, is thoroughly appealing. The speed of the kitchen is, I’m afraid, rather less so and I wouldn’t be telling the whole story if I brushed over that. It takes 45 minutes for the starters to turn up. Curiously, I put this down to the restaurant being completely empty when we arrived, and not being especially troubled by much custom after that. The fact is kitchens really get a move on when they are under pressure; when the orders are flying in and the plates are flying out. The old saying, that if you want a job done quickly you should give it to someone who’s busy, applies equally to restaurant kitchens. This one fully deserves to be very busy indeed.

4/10/2022,"The question We married young and quickly after a whirlwind summer. I had just turned 17 and he was 21. It felt like the greatest love affair. Intense. He opened me up to a world of freedom to discover myself – parties, being on the road, and so many wonderful, interesting people. Fast forward 20-plus years and two children later and I sit here looking at my life, yearning for that summer of love again. To go back to that happier time. Instead, I find myself full of regret, with resentment bubbling deep inside. We live in isolation, with no friends. Socialising is expensive and with only my income for the past 15 years, it is one of the sacrifices we made. Work used to be my escape, my chance to be with other people, but since the pandemic hit, I’ve been working from home and this is now permanent. During this time, I have discovered I can’t stand my husband. I still love and care for him deeply, but I can’t bear to be around him. I’m ambitious and want to be free to do things. He wants me tied to the house serving him. We have very different ideas of what our partnership should be and no amount of talking, explaining how I feel, acknowledging his feelings, ever seems to change anything. I fear we are no longer compatible. I don’t want to lose him, but how long do I go on being unhappy in myself? I’ve dedicated my entire adult life to him – his needs, making him happy. When do I get to be happy? Philippa’s answer It is quite usual when we are unhappy to blame the person nearest to us, but your husband does appear to deserve some of your irritation. You love and care for him, you don’t want to lose him but, on the other hand, you cannot stand to be around him – and if he is insisting that your main purpose in life is to serve him, I’m not surprised. If he is coercing you to never change things or otherwise forcing you to live a life you don’t wish to lead, then you need to get out or get him out and keep the children with you. Have a look at womensaid.org.uk. It’s about coercive control and if it rings bells, get help. But if you are just waiting for him to agree with you, then you must do whatever it is you want to do and he will have a choice about whether to stay with you, or to leave. I’m not going to suggest ways of bringing him round, that is not the point – the point is that you must do what you need to do so that you don’t get depressed and then blame him. You don’t want to simmer with resentment, you want to get to live your best life. It doesn’t sound like he is going to agree that this is what you must do, but you can do it anyway. I’m hoping you have more agency over your life at 37 than you did at 17. The word “obey” has been removed from the marriage service, but sometimes it takes more than omitting a word to overcome centuries of tradition. We tend to unthinkingly follow the examples of our parents, who are following their parents in turn. If you need my permission to disappoint your husband’s expectations, I give it. I want to encourage you to be as sociable, ambitious and as adventurous as you like – but I expect you still want his blessing. What if I put it like this? Would you want your son to have the expectation, like your husband seems to have, that his feelings are more important than his future partner’s? Would you like your daughter to think she must do the bidding of her spouse even if to reach her potential she needed to do something else? It is time to break this cycle of love and obey; you can just love. You are nostalgic for your 17-year-old self and your summer of love. That excitement would have been partly fuelled by the infatuation you get at the beginning of a relationship when erotic love and discovering each other keep things exciting. And partly because it is easier for a 21-year-old to impress a 17-year-old girl than it is a 41-year-old to impress a woman of 37. Sustainable, mature love is more about caring and doing things for each other than the heady, infatuated initial stage. It also means supporting each other to find fulfilment. However, if the caring and support is only going in one direction, from you to him, and you never get to be the priority, it doesn’t look like a mutually loving relationship – it looks like you are being a martyr. You don’t have to play the martyr. You can be ambitious and strive for what would fulfil you – and you can even do that and stay married. If you give yourself permission to live the life you want without his blessing, and get to live it, it is very likely you won’t find him as irritating as you do now – you might even warm to him again. He may even discover that his world does not fall apart when you get more of your needs met and reach for your goals. I want you to fall in love with life again. To answer your question, the time for you to be happy is now. Don’t wait for him to come around.

4/10/2022,"A dramatic loss of faith in the ability of British democracy to serve the interests of UK voters is revealed in a new report that finds that donors to political parties and big businesses are now commonly viewed by the electorate as the main drivers of government policy. Disturbing evidence that millions of voters feel their voices and views go largely unheard while big money interests hold most sway is uncovered in the latest report by the IPPR thinktank, in collaboration with the Observer, on the future of democracy. The study, entitled Road to Renewal, draws on YouGov polling of 3,442 adults, which found that just 6% of voters in elections in Great Britain believe their views are the main influences behind eventual decisions on policy taken by government ministers. By contrast, more than four times as many (25%) believe major donors to political parties have the most influence over shaping policy, followed by business groups and corporations (16%), newspapers and the media (13%) and lobbyists and pressure groups (12%). Just 2% cite trade unions as the main forces behind policy decisions, which the report’s authors note is “a remarkable shift since the 1970s and 1980s when concerns about overly powerful unions was widespread”. The polling was jointly commissioned by IPPR, the Electoral Reform Society and Unlock Democracy. The study traces growing dissatisfaction with advanced democracies worldwide over recent decades, reflected in falling turnout at elections, falling party memberships, and more people switching loyalties, including to populist alternatives. It calls for an urgent rethink by mainstream parties of how democracy works in the UK, including steps to reconnect citizens with politics and politicians through devolution of more powers. It calls for greater checks on executive power to safeguard representative democracy, laying blame at the door of Boris Johnson’s government for ignoring parliament when it can. “The sidelining of parliament by the current government – including briefing to the media before MPs, passing sweeping pandemic legislation without parliamentary censure, minimal parliamentary oversight of Brexit negotiations and the prorogation of parliament,” were all examples of abuses that contributed to lack of faith in the democratic process. The public’s verdict on politicians’ ability to comprehend their lives is damning. Asked how well they believed “politicians understood the lives of people like you”, a total of 78% of voting adults said badly, with this number split between the 36% who said “fairly badly” and 42% who answered “very badly”. Just 1% said “very well” and 12% “fairly well”. Young UK adults (18-24) are least likely to say democracy serves them well (just 19% say it operates well against 55% who say badly), while those aged 65 and over are most likely to say it is working for them (46% say well and 47% badly.) IPPR warns that mainstream social democratic parties that fail to tackle the root causes of discontent with the political system jeopardise the foundations of liberal democracy and their own prospects of securing power. Parth Patel, IPPR research fellow, said that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had led many leaders to praise the merits of liberal democracies over those of dictatorships, despite the many shortcomings of the former in the eyes of UK voters. “In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, our leaders have lined up to champion liberal democracy. But the reality is that the battle for democracy needs not only to be won abroad, it must be won at home too. “In truth, democracies have not been delivering well for their citizens. Politicians and parties are increasingly out of touch, and the sway of ordinary citizens over public policy has declined. Many are opting out of political participation altogether, while large numbers have lent their support to populist challengers – signs of a protest against ‘democracy as usual’.” In the 1990s, the report says that around two-thirds of citizens of western Europe, North America, Northeast Asia and Australasia were satisfied with democracy in their countries. “Today a majority in these regions are dissatisfied. Nowhere has the rise in democratic dissatisfaction been steeper than in Anglo-Saxon democracies.” Patel said mainstream political parties had too often tried to “imitate the populist agenda of their opponents, rather than to tackle the underlying causes of democratic discontent”. “They must now take a long, hard look in the mirror and commit to meaningful reforms that put the voices of citizens back at the centre of democracy. ‘Giving back control’ should be a dividing line at the next election.” The report will be available for download",News/Politics,"Young adults show dramatic loss of faith in UK democracy, survey reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/10/young-adults-loss-of-faith-in-uk-democracy-survey
4/10/2022,"It has never been enough for politicians to abide by the law. Voters quite rightly expect much more: for their leaders to uphold standards of integrity and honesty and the spirit of the rules that they expect everyone else to live by. This is why the revelations about the financial affairs of Rishi Sunak and his wife are so damaging, not just to him personally, but to the government in which he serves and the wider political system. Sunak’s wife appears to have reduced her tax liability through tax arrangements that call into question their household’s commitment to paying their fair share into the Treasury coffers that Sunak, as chancellor, is responsible for. Sunak is believed to be the wealthiest member of parliament. But his own fortune is dwarfed by that of his wife, Akshata Murty, whose stake in her father’s business Infosys is worth around £690m, making her one of the UK’s richest women. Sunak is not only one of the most senior members of the government, he is widely acknowledged to have prime ministerial ambitions. It is therefore reasonable to expect that he and his wife would make meticulous efforts to organise their financial affairs so that their primary tax liability is in the UK, the country in which they and their children live and which Sunak clearly aspires to lead. The revelations of the last few days are therefore extraordinary in what they reveal, both about Sunak’s lack of political skill and his diminished sense of responsibility to the exchequer. First, we learned that despite living in the UK, Murty is non-domiciled for UK tax purposes, meaning that she pays tax on her global income in India rather than the UK. We do not know whether and how much tax she paid on the £54.4m in dividends she has received from Infosys over the last seven years; whether tax was paid at the lower rate that is applicable in India or whether she may even have used a tax haven to reduce her tax liabilities further. Second, it transpires that Sunak, like his wife, held a US green card during six years as an MP and 18 months as chancellor. This means he was a permanent US resident for tax purposes, legally committed to making “the US your permanent home” while a senior UK minister. It also means Murty had made that commitment to US authorities, yet Sunak’s defence of her non-domiciled status in the UK was that she eventually planned to move to India to care for her parents. Lastly, it has emerged that Sunak has been listed as a beneficiary of tax haven trusts in the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands since becoming chancellor. The British Virgin Islands are the subject of an anti-corruption inquiry set up by the British government, due to report in the coming weeks. There are substantive issues here about how much Sunak and Murty have saved in terms of their tax liabilities in this way. The exact figure is unknown but could be substantial. Even though Murty has now said she will pay taxes on her global income in the UK, if she remains non-domiciled, she stands to save £280m in inheritance tax under the provisions of a 1956 Anglo-Indian tax treaty. It is completely inappropriate for the chancellor and his wife to use the tax-reducing potential of non-domiciliary status in a way that simply isn’t available to the vast majority of British citizens, many of whom will be paying more tax as a result of Sunak’s spring statement. Quite aside from the substantive issues, Sunak’s defensive reaction has revealed his own sense of entitlement. He has criticised journalists asking entirely legitimate questions about his wife’s financial interests in Russia, as other companies have pulled out. His political allies have tried to write this off as a “political hit job”. The source of these leaks is irrelevant to the questions they raise. Sunak appears bemused that voters might expect him to go above and beyond the law in terms of his family’s tax affairs. There are parallels with the other scandals to hit this government: the fact that illegal parties were held in Downing Street attended by Boris Johnson as the public were expected to abide by strict lockdown restrictions that prevented some from saying goodbye to their loved ones. The whiff of financial corruption that hangs over the question of how Johnson funded the renovation of his Downing Street flat. The fact that there have been no consequences for Priti Patel after the independent adviser on the ministerial code found she had broken it by bullying civil service staff. This all contributes to the sense that we are governed by ministers who regard the rules as being for other people, not themselves. As we saw with the expense scandal more than a decade ago, this damages citizens’ trust in democracy. A new survey on the future of democracy published in the Observer today finds 78% of the public think politicians understand their lives badly and just 6% think their voters’ views are the main influence on government decision-making. Sunak has done much more than weaken his own leadership prospects: he has undermined public faith in politicians more broadly.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on the Sunak family’s tax affairs | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/10/observer-view-of-sunak-family-tax-affairs
4/10/2022,"Ofsted’s obsession with memory as the key to children’s learning and as a measure of the effectiveness of a school’s curriculum is misplaced (“Ofsted’s ‘pop’ quiz tests are unfair to schools, say heads”, News). Learning is more than recall and everyone’s recall is patchy. If tested themselves, how many inspectors could remember what they were told a year or two before on a previous inspection? If inspectors can’t remember, why should they expect learners, especially young children, to? The chief inspector should ponder the wisdom in the old adage, education is what remains after you’ve forgotten what you learned in school.Professor Colin RichardsSpark Bridge, Cumbria The report by the head of Ofsted, Amanda Spielman, on the serious delays in young children’s development as a result of the lockdown periods is hardly surprising in view of the fact that the Labour government’s inspired provision and policy of setting up Sure Start centres in 1999 has been scuppered by Tory governments cutting the funding by two-thirds since 2010. By the onset of the Covid lockdowns, more than 500 centres had been closed. This is a classic example of how national policies repeatedly come and go. The head of Ofsted and the government have an opportunity to demand and fund the re-establishment of pre-school centres for young vulnerable children. Their staff’s skills, experience and established centres are a national resource that have been able to adapt to the vagaries of national lockdowns, and mitigate some of the sad picture Spielman reveals.Simon ClementsSheffield As an experienced schools’ inspector, I am fully aware that the humanities and creative subjects are severely neglected by numbers of maintained and independent schools alike in the run-up to year 6 Sats tests, preparation for the 11+ in grammar school areas and entry to leading independent schools. All such measures represent cramming, with all the attendant disadvantages. Gradgrind, you are not yet dead. As for 11- and 12-year-olds being unable to explain clearly the “principles of the rule of law”, perhaps our illustrious PM and his chancellor should take the same test. How do your readers believe they would score?Una StevensCompton, Winchester Torsten Bell uses US data to claim that when GPs retire, the use of other emergency services rises (“Why baby boomers might end up healthier if their GPs retire early”, Comment). This in itself would be an argument to strengthen primary care in the UK. Bell then claims that new GPs are more likely to pick up a new diagnosis of diseases such as Alzheimer’s, concluding that GPs retiring can be a good thing for patients, while pointing out that it also pushes up the cost of healthcare. We believe that GP continuity of care not only saves lives and money but also leads to longer life expectancy. The age of your GP is not the problem here. It is the absolute lack of them. The UK is facing a GP crisis that long predates the pandemic. We need to retain our GPs at all stages of their careers – but especially those with many years of experience – who are also best placed to support and mentor junior GPs and the ever-growing number of allied healthcare professionals who are being employed to try to prop up a failing system in the UK.Dr Lizzie Toberty, GP lead, Doctors’ Association UK; Dr Ellen Welch, GP, Cumbria; Dr Simon Hodes, GP, Watford; Dr Shan Hussain, GP, Nottingham; Dr Lizzie Croton, GP, Birmingham; Dr Neena Jha, GP, Hertfordshire; Dr Louise Hyde, GP, Wales; Dr Rosie Shire, GP, Warrington; Dr Kartik Modha, GP, London; Dr Ayan Panja, GP, Hertfordshire If Kenan Malik is right and it’s strength and muscle mass that’s causing a problem for transgendered athletes to change category from male to female or vice versa, then perhaps the categories are wrong (“From pool to track: disputes over trans athletes mustn’t make everyone a loser”, Comment). Why not base them on strength and muscle mass, say simply categories 1, 2 and 3, depending on where the athlete’s personal readings put them on a scale combining both these factors. Each sport would have to reorganise, but why we need to categorise people simply into being male or female has always puzzled me. I know it keeps things straightforward but things sometimes need to change, and making people fit into convenient boxes doesn’t work for everybody.Ian HoggNorth Leigh, Witney, Oxfordshire Ravi Veriah Jacques is right to highlight the lack of treatments for long Covid syndromes, particularly for those with prominent fatigue, and the lack of research underlying this (“I have long Covid and despair that the government ignores its blight”, Comment). He may be right about the link with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). But we disagree when he rejects rehabilitation treatments, such as graded exercise therapy (GET) and cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), which have been shown to help fatigue related to many illnesses, such as multiple sclerosis and CFS. It would be bizarre indeed if long Covid were to be the only illness that rehabilitation could not benefit. Their helpfulness does not imply that the illness is psychological. As leaders of the Pace trial that he mentions, we also think he is misinformed regarding the Pace trial of these treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome, which showed that CBT and GET were moderately effective and safe treatments, so long as properly negotiated and delivered by trained therapists. Yes, Nice has recently advised that GET should not be offered and CBT only used to reduce distress, but four of the medical Royal Colleges did not endorse this advice as they considered Nice had made errors when reviewing the evidence. CBT and GET may help some sufferers from long Covid but, unless we fund research to test them, we will never know for certain.Prof Peter White, emeritus professor of Psychological Medicine at Queen Mary University of London; Prof Trudie Chalder, professor of Cognitive Behavioural Psychotherapy, King’s College London; Prof Michael Sharpe, professor of Psychological Medicine, University of Oxford Anna Bahatelya’s 100th birthday wish reminded me of an old story regarding Hitler and his desire to know his future (“‘What do I wish for my 100th birthday? That Putin will die’”, News). He had heard of a rabbi who had a reputation of being able to foresee, with some accuracy, future events. Hitler summoned the rabbi to Berlin and asked if he could foretell when he, Hitler, would die. He answered that all he could predict was that it would occur on an important Jewish holiday. Hitler asked which holiday and the rabbi replied: “Fuhrer, when you die it will be an important Jewish holiday.”Ronald OliverElie, Fife Regarding the furore over the renaming of a ploughman’s lunch to a ploughperson’s lunch (“May I have a word about… a right cheese and pickle barney”, Comment), why not introduce a ploughwoman’s lunch, similar to the first, but with the addition of an egg? As in a croque monsieur becoming a croque madame, the poached egg on top supposedly reminiscent of a bonnet.Margaret RileyBlackrod, Lancashire",News/From the Observer,"Ofsted, take note – learning is about more than recall | Letters",https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/apr/10/observer-letters-ofsted-take-note-learning-is-about-more-than-recall
