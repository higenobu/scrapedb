12/28/2021,"The festive programme in the Premier League is fabled for its surprises, but for Manchester United this was an unwelcome dose of déjà vu. From the start at St James’ Park, this game called to mind the early days of Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s reign, with this exact fixture his fourth game in charge – and fourth win – three years ago and precisely two weeks into his tenure at Old Trafford. On that occasion at least club and fans were still basking in their escape from the José Mourinho psychodrama, and a sense of goodwill towards Solskjær was clear. The Norwegian had his fingerprints smeared generously over the victory too, his double substitution just after the hour – bringing on Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sánchez – swinging a game of high tension and low quality. It seemed feted, Lukaku breaking the deadlock 38 seconds after coming on as a second-half substitute and Sánchez at the hub of Marcus Rashford’s goal which wrapped things up. It all added up to an underwhelming but successful performance, which mapped out with reasonable accuracy what we could come to expect from United for the next few years.  This time at Newcastle, Manchester United’s double change couldn’t wait that long, such had been the sheer emptiness of the display offered by Ralf Rangnick’s side before the break. Jadon Sancho and Edinson Cavani played their second-half part in turning the tanker around, and really looked United’s only real hope of doing so. Sancho provided for Cavani only for the Uruguayan to scuff a presentable opportunity badly wide. It turned out to be a rehearsal for the equaliser: a kind deflection returned to Cavani from his first shot – from Diogo Dalot’s cross this time – and the the visitors caught a needed break on a hitherto barren night. Cavani is clear as the perfect partner for Cristiano Ronaldo, sharing only an age bracket and a plentiful history of goals with the Portugal captain. At nearly 35 Cavani brings the hustle and the urgency which Ronaldo has rarely been required to provide in his career, and which United have lacked all over the pitch for way too long. It stood out like a sore thumb here, with United pedestrian in possession in their own half even after the leveller. Without the post and David de Gea’s upstretched right hand, which denied the home side twice in a handful of seconds with three minutes to go, the vistors would have headed back to Manchester with the defeat that this miserable performance deserved. No feature of Manchester United’s game in the first 45 minutes had been as notable as the frequent sight of Rangnick’s downturned bottom lip plodding back through the technical area. He was shaking his head disapprovingly in the direction of his bench, with his side in his familiar 4-2-2-2 shape but with none of the zip that typically characterises his teams. It was always going to be a steep climb for the players to get where their new coach really wants them to be mid-season, with so little time to work. The problems of adaptation are clear. Newcastle escaped the press too easily throughout – a Bruno Fernandes sprint here and a Rashford saunter there – and when United lost the ball, they were consistently overexposed. Manchester United losing possession was commonplace, even before Raphaël Varane was caught dawdling on the ball by Sean Longstaff on the way to Allan Saint-Maximin’s opener. Rangnick’s side had been given their warning. A Harry Maguire slip in the second minute had let in Ryan Fraser, fortunately without consequence for the visitors. Individual quality covered a multitude of sins under Solskjaer, right up until it couldn’t anymore. Here that innate aptitude flickered far too briefly to give Manchester United a chance to snatch the points. There was one sliver where you saw how it might come together, when Ronaldo’s round-the-corner flick found Fernandes late in the first half. The latter’s sidefoot was comfortably smothered by Dubravka, but Ronaldo had been lingering offside in the first instance anyway. It was typical of the torpor with which Rangnick has his hands full.",Sport/Football,Rangnick bereft as Manchester United slip to Solskjær levels at Newcastle | Andy Brassell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/dec/28/rangnick-bereft-as-manchester-united-slip-to-solskjr-levels-at-newcastle
12/28/2021,"Britain’s housing market is to slow dramatically in 2022 as borrowing costs rise and household budgets come under mounting strain, property experts have predicted. After a year of booming prices driven by stamp duty holidays across the UK and changes in the types of properties being bought and sold, forecasters typically suggest house price growth of between 3 and 5% next year.  The most recent figures from Nationwide building society showed annual price growth running at 10%. In London’s wealthiest boroughs, however, price rises are expected to outstrip those recorded this year, and could beat the figure for the UK as a whole. The property firm Savills said it expected growth of 6% in prime London neighbourhoods in 2022, up from 3.2% in 2021, but that renewed uncertainty over Covid could push that growth into later in the year. Savills said prices had started to rise again for flats in prime areas, as people began to return to the city or looked for a pied-à-terre to use while there. Frances Clacy, an associate director at Savills, said: “Activity levels have picked up significantly over recent months, but the renewed Covid-19 uncertainty adds an unwelcome additional layer of doubt that will likely push the expected bounce in values further into 2022. “Still, we believe it’s a question of when and not if prices rebound, particularly as more pent up demand builds, so prime central London remains a market to watch closely. Its bounce can be surprisingly rapid.” The London market had fallen as wealthy buyers left the capital during months of home working, and overseas travel restrictions dampened the interest of buyers from other countries. The market elsewhere has been boosted by a “race for space” during the pandemic along with government initiatives such as stamp duty holidays, the last of which ended in September in September, and cheap mortgage deals thanks to record low interest rates. The Bank of England unexpectedly lifted interest rates for the first time in three years in December in response to growing concerns over inflation, which reached a decade high of 5.1% in November. Borrowing costs, however, are still lower than before the pandemic, and analysts believe any future rate increases will be limited because it appears far from over. Savills has forecast house price growth across the UK market of 3.5% next year as the economy rebounds from the pandemic and a shortage of homes for sale continues to underpin prices. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors predicts that house prices could end next year 3-5% higher than at the start of the year. Tarrant Parsons, an economist at Rics, said: “2021 has been an exceptionally active year for the housing market, with transactions close to record levels. However, despite more homeowners seeking more space and various incentive programmes … transaction activity for the coming 12 months will inevitably slow. “All else being equal, higher borrowing costs will dampen demand across the market to a certain extent. The major challenge will be around the lack of stock on the market with inventory back close to historic lows, and shows little sign of easing.” Halifax, one of the biggest mortgage lenders, said earlier this month that it expected price growth to slow considerably as a result of rising living costs. It forecast price growth of zero to 2% in 2022. This compared with increases of 8% recorded so far this year and 6% in 2020. It estimated the average house price in December at £272,992, almost £34,000 higher than at the start of the pandemic. The property website Rightmove has predicted house prices will rise by 5% nationally and 3% in London. Zoopla, a rival site, expects 3% next year and forecast 1.2m transactions, down from 1.5m in 2021 but in line with the average number of transactions over the last five years. Robert Gardner, the chief economist at Nationwide building society, has not put a figure on how much he expects prices to move in 2022. He said: “The outlook remains extremely uncertain. The strength of the market surprised us all in 2021 and could do so again next year.”",Lifestyle/Money,"UK house price growth set to slow in 2022, property experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/28/uk-house-price-growth-2022-forecast
12/28/2021,"The last three winners of the Grade One Savills Chase – A Plus Tard, Kemboy and Delta Work – are all in the hunt for a second success at Leopardstown on Tuesday, but there is no doubt where the punters will be placing their faith as A Plus Tard and Rachael Blackmore are certain to start favourite, probably at odds-on. Henry de Bromhead’s chaser has raced only twice since powering past Kemboy and Melon in the final strides 12 months ago, but both runs strongly suggested that A Plus Tard is improving all the time as a close second behind Minella Indo in the Gold Cup was followed by a deeply impressively success in the Betfair Chase in November.  Galvin, the National Hunt Chase winner at Cheltenham in March, is a potentially high-class opponent but still has plenty to find with the favourite, while Janadil, second in the John Durkan on his first start in an open Grade One, is also interesting as he steps up to three miles for the first time. A Plus Tard (2.20), though, is the only horse at single-figure odds for the Cheltenham Gold Cup after Minella Indo’s disappointing run at Kempton on Sunday and it will be a major disappointment if he cannot deliver the goods. Leopardstown 1.10 Ardhill will be popular here to follow up a recent easy success at Ascot when blinkered for the first time but he has taken a hike in the weights and the headgear is off today. As a result, A Great View could be a fair alternative at around 12-1 after an eye-catching run into second at Navan earlier this month. Catterick 1.25 Representing Bob is two-from-two over fences and still on a fair mark with further improvement likely. Leopardstown 1.45 A fascinating match-up between former star novice Klassical Dream and the 1-2 from last season’s Stayers’ Hurdle, Flooring Porter and Sire Du Berlais. Willie Mullins’s seven-year-old has had plenty of problems but he is top-class on his day and a repeat of his form – off a 487-day break – at Punchestown in April could well be enough. Catterick Bridge 2.00 Findthetime needed every yard of two miles to get his head in front at Sedgefield in November and this step up in trip should suit for his handicap debut. Leicester 2.45 Red Happy has form in France that puts him right in the mix off 123 and he could make a winning debut for David Pipe.

12/28/2021,"Teenagers whose parents or caregivers smoke are four times as likely to take up smoking, medical experts have warned. The statistic was one of many released as part of the Better Health Smoke Free campaign to encourage smokers to make giving up their new year resolution.  NHS and behavioural health experts discussed the link between adult smoking and the likelihood of children in their household becoming smokers. Other findings discussed by the group were that early teenagers whose main caregiver smoked were more than twice as likely to have tried cigarettes and four times as likely to be a regular smoker. Maggie Throup, parliamentary under-secretary of state and minister for vaccines and public health, said: “We know that many people make a quit attempt in January, and while there are so many good reasons to stop smoking for yourself, we hope that this new campaign – by highlighting the intergenerational smoking link with parents influencing their children – will be the added motivation many need to ditch the cigarettes for good this year.” Other statistics included research from NatCen Social Research, which had also shown children aged 10 to 15 were more likely to smoke if either their mother or father currently smoked. Children were also more likely to smoke if either parent had smoked in the past, even if they were not a current smoker, the same research showed. The Better Health Smoke Free campaign comes from the new Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID) in the Department of Health and Social Care. Deputy chief medical officer for England and joint lead for the OHID, Dr Jeanelle de Gruchy, said: “Smoking is terrible for your health but it also has a negative impact on people around you. Most people know the dangers of secondary smoke but we should not overlook the impact that parents have as role models.” Prof Nick Hopkinson of Imperial College London added: “Our research findings are clear – adult smoking has a tangible impact on children. Children whose caregivers smoke are four times as likely to take up smoking themselves. “The most effective way to help prevent this would be for adults to quit smoking – clearly not only does this have enormous benefits for them but it will also benefit their children both now and in later life.” Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that one in eight adults in England are smokers.",News/Society,"Teenagers four times more likely to smoke if parents do, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/28/smokers-teenagers-parents
