1/4/2022,"Hundreds of drivers on I-95 in northern Virginia have been stuck for hours in the snow. Motorists told Insider that they're running out of fuel for heating and have no food or water. Some have been stuck on the road for more than 12 hours, and haven't heard from the authorities yet. Drivers in northern Virginia have been stuck for hours on Interstate 95 on Monday evening after a crash involving six tractor-trailers and multiple downed trees ground traffic to a halt. Both north- and southbound lanes of 1-95 were blocked near Fredericksburg, according to Virginia's Department of Transportation. Many of those locked in the standstill say they are running out of fuel for heating and are without food or water. The multiple truck accident occurred as Virginia was blanketed with more than 14-inches of snow, leaving more than 400,000 residents without power. ""There's snow everywhere. I need to keep the heat on,"" Kiran Bose, a driver traveling with four others to Richmond, told Insider. ""I'm a quarter tank away from the end."" His car hadn't moved for four hours as of 1.30 a.m. local time, and the 24-year-old recent graduate said what was supposed to be a five-hour drive has turned into a 12-hour ordeal in frigid weather. ""Everyone's in the same boat. Most of them were out of their cars, but they couldn't withstand the cold,"" Bose said. The temperature in Fredericksburg as of Tuesday at 4:00 a.m. ET is 16 degrees Fahrenheit, according to Accuweather. The nearest gas station, Bose said, is three to four miles away. ""It's a nightmare. We can't walk in the snow. The roads are icy and slippery."" The six-trailer crash happened around noon on Monday, Virginia police said, according to NBC 4 News. The semi-trucks jack-knifed across the roadway. Since then, crews from Virginia's Department of Transportation have been working through the night to plow roads and relieve the traffic, per the department's Twitter account. VDOT did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Truck driver Matthew Marchand told Insider that he'd been at a dead stop since 6.45 p.m., though he already noticed traffic slowing to a crawl before noon. Overall, he's moved 20 miles in 15 hours, he said. ""The road hasn't been plowed in any appreciable way. There's sections of road that still have a half-foot of snow on them,"" the 36-year-old said. Neither he nor Bose said they'd received any word from the authorities on incoming aid. Marchand, whose truck is well-provisioned with fuel, food, and water for winter driving emergencies, said he'd been sharing some of his supplies with nearby drivers. In his travels across the US, he said he'd never seen people stranded without supplies for so long on a snowed-in highway. ""Roads do close. I drive in northern Canada, and roads do get closed for one or two days. But people are prepared for it because they know what the reality is,"" Marchand said. ""No one driving on I-95 is ever thinking that I-95 is going to shut down for in excess of 14 or 15 hours.""

1/4/2022,"Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) drew outrage with her threatening response to Twitter’s ban of fellow far-right extremist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-Ga.). Twitter permanently suspended conspiracy theorist Greene’s personal account over the weekend for repeated violations of the platform’s COVID-19 misinformation policy. Boebert hit back, saying Twitter has booted “a sitting US President” and “a sitting member of US Congress.” Then-President Donald Trump was banned in January 2021 for inciting the deadly U.S. Capitol riot. Greene and Trump are “of course, both from the same party,” Boebert noted. “They forget that in 2022 we are taking back the House and we WILL be holding them accountable!” she added.

1/4/2022,"BEIRUT (AP) — The leader of Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group verbally attacked the king of Saudi Arabia on Monday, saying Riyadh helped spread extremist Islamic ideology worldwide and is taking the thousands of Lebanese who work in the oil-rich Persian Gulf region “hostage.” Hassan Nasrallah’s statements during a speech in Beirut came in response to comments by King Salman, who called on the Lebanese in a speech last week “to end the terrorist Hezbollah’s control” of Lebanon. The comments come as Lebanese authorities are trying to mend relations with Saudi Arabia that hit a new low in October when the kingdom recalled its ambassador from Beirut and banned all Lebanese imports. The Saudi move followed comments by a Lebanese Cabinet minister who said in a televised interview that the war in Yemen was futile and called it an aggression by the Saudi-led coalition. Early last month, Lebanese Information Minister George Kordahi, who made the comments before he took the job, resigned from his post but the move did not heal the tense relations. The Yemen conflict began with the 2014 takeover of the capital Sanaa by the Houthi rebels, who control much of the country’s north. The Saudi-led coalition entered the war the following year, determined to restore the internationally recognized government and oust the rebels. Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati issued a statement saying Nasrallah's comments do not represent the government nor the “majority of Lebanese.” He called on Lebanese politicians to spare Lebanon from statements “that lead nowhere.” “Your highness the king, the terrorist is (the side) who exported Wahhabi-Daeshi ideology to the world and they are you,” Nasrallah said, referring to the Islamic State group by its Arabic acronym of Daesh. Nasrallah also blamed Saudi Arabia for sending Saudi suicide attackers to Syria and Iraq as well as for the war in Yemen. “The terrorist is whoever takes hundreds of thousands or tens of thousands of Lebanese as hostages and threatens the Lebanese state with evicting them,” Nasrallah said during a rally marking the second anniversary of the U.S. killing of top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad. There have been concerns in Lebanon that the tension could affect tens of thousands of Lebanese who work in the gulf. Saudi Ambassador to Lebanon Waleed Bukhari responded immediately after Nasrallah’s speech with a tweet calling the Hezbollah leader’s comments “lies that cannot be hidden in darkness.” Bukhari did not name Nasrallah but referred to him as Abu Raghal, a historic Arab personality that represents treason.",World/Associated Press,Hezbollah leader launches verbal attack against Saudi king,https://news.yahoo.com/hezbollah-leader-launches-verbal-attack-193818027.html
