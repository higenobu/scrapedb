1/14/2022,"When it comes to the Federal Reserve's looming interest rate hiking cycle, speed of movement should be top of mind among investors that will have to navigate the evolving liquidity backdrop with precision.  ""I think it's the speed at which the Fed will have to move [on rates] that probably defines market behavior, not in a broad sense but in terms of leadership,"" said Charles Schwab chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders on Yahoo Finance Live.  The Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading out on Wednesday underscores why the Fed may have to increase interest rates as soon as March, which may trigger more pressure on the stock market. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' December CPI reading showed prices rose at a 7.0% year-over-year clip at the end of 2021, marking the fastest increase since 1982. This matched economist estimates, and accelerated from November's already elevated 6.8% increase. ""Today’s report continues a trend of inflation prints that reside at multi-decade highs over the near-term, and we do not expect to see any letup for a few months, but some improvement in inflation rates may be expected as spring/summer approach,"" said Rick Rieder, BlackRock's global investment officer of fixed income.  Stocks were volatile in the wake of the data with the Dow Jones Industrial Average giving up gains by afternoon trading. But concerns on the Fed moving quicker than expected to lift rates to fight off inflation has dominated the market narrative to kick off 2022. Goldman Sachs just this week raised its 2022 rate increase expectations to four times from three times.  The Nasdaq Composite is down 3% on the year — driven lower by weakness in high multiple software names — as traders bake in less robust returns in a land of higher rates.  For Schwab's Sonders, she isn't ruling out the market seeing ""rotational corrections"" throughout the year given the uncertainty on the pace of Fed rate increases.  ""If you go back to the post World War 2 era and look at every hiking cycle - when the Fed was moving quickly versus slow cycles where they might take a break for a meeting or two - there is a huge difference in terms of how the market behaved in a slow cycle,"" Sonders explained. ""I think these bouts of volatility — some leadership shifts that can happen really quickly — I think that is likely to stay with us at least in the first half of this year.""

1/14/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The loyalty of Cathie Wood’s legion of fans may be finally waning, as the new year bloodbath in speculative technology stocks hands the star money manager a miserable start to 2022.

Understanding the Evolving Advice on Masks Investors pulled $352 million from Wood’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) on Wednesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the biggest outflow since March. The withdrawals come as ARKK languishes at the lowest in about 18 months. ARK Investment Management’s main exchange-traded fund has dropped more than 15% since the start of the year as top holdings like Roku Inc., Zoom Video Communications Inc. and Teledoc Health Inc. are caught in the tech rout. While the flow is small compared to ARK assets overall -- its nine ETFs still boast about $25 billion -- it marks a potential turning point for an investor base that until now has barely wavered in its support for Wood and the firm she founded in 2014. ARKK’s outflow was its third-biggest on record; the last time the fund lost over $300 million it was trading 44% higher. Market conditions have been turning ever-more hostile to the disruptive tech companies beloved by Wood. Rampant inflation has spurred a hawkish turn by the Federal Reserve, spelling the end to pandemic-era stimulus and the ultra-low yields that helped pump up equity valuations. Investors are pulling back from speculative bets and growth firms whose profit potential lies in the future -- exactly the kind of stocks favored by ARK. “Heavy outflows from a fund, active or passive, can be a sign that investors’ faith in growth and momentum-style investing is flagging,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. “Coupled with weakness in cryptocurrencies, meme stocks such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment and a strong rally in energy and financial stocks, it does feel as if the market mood is changing.” ARKK is now down about 50% from its all-time high in February last year. Yet many of its investors -- who poured billions in after the ETF returned more than 150% in 2020 -- have stayed loyal even as they lost money. Fund assets have declined by about $15 billion since the peak, but only approximately $1.1 billion of that was from net outflows -- the rest of the drop has been caused by performance. The ETF is now trading well below an estimate of its average purchase price since-inception. Wood’s repeated message is that the firm’s investment horizon is for at least five years, and that the potential of the innovative companies ARK targets is huge. It has regularly used pullbacks in its high-conviction names to increase its position, even as some on Wall Street fret over concentration risk. The firm’s miserable run seems to be getting even worse in 2022, and every one of its U.S.-listed ETFs is down so far. The worst performer is the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) with a drop of 17%. The best is ARK Israel Innovative Technology ETF (IZRL), which is down 5%. Alongside ARKK, the other eight funds lost almost $50 million combined Wednesday. The settlement schedule for the products mean that flow data arrives with a one-day lag. ARKK was 1% lower in premarket trading at 7:12 a.m. in New York on Friday.
