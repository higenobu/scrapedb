12/11/2021,"No 10 has cancelled its Christmas party this year because of worries about Covid, despite still encouraging people to go ahead with workplace functions. Boris Johnson’s official spokesperson said the decision was taken to shelve plans for a No 10 Christmas gathering after the move to implement plan B, but stressed that other people were still free to go ahead with theirs.  He denied it was anything to do with the furore over the party held in Downing Street on 18 December last year when restrictions on socialising were in place. This party and other gatherings of No 10 staff during lockdown are now under investigation by Simon Case, the cabinet secretary. Asked whether No 10’s party was still going ahead this year, Johnson’s spokesperson said: “I think we’ve made clear since the latest situation with Omicron, obviously that’s taking up great deal of time at the moment. There’s no plans for that in No 10.” Asked when the decision was taken, they said: “Following the decision on plan B and the latest data that we’ve got.” However, Downing Street said it was up to individual businesses to decide whether Christmas parties should go ahead. The spokesperson said: “We do not think there is a need to cancel people coming together in hospitality venues like that.” Asked whether it was therefore the wrong message to cancel Christmas drinks, he said: “It’s down to individual businesses and indeed departments to make a decision on what’s right. We’re simply saying as a matter of fact there’s nothing in the guidance or the regulation that requires individuals to do so. We want people to keep using hospitality. We know that’s important, and we’re confident people will.” It comes as No 10 faced continuing pressure over gatherings held during lockdown last year, with the Good Law Project saying it was considering legal action against the Metropolitan police for declining to investigate whether the law was broken. The organisation, which has taken legal action against the government over multiple issues including the award of contracts during the pandemic, wrote to the Met asking it to justify its failure to investigate reports of an unlawful party being held at No 10 Downing Street on 18 December 2020 – and threatening court proceedings if it failed to do so. The pre-action protocol letter also asked the Met to provide details of its policy not to investigate retrospective breaches of the Covid regulations.Jo Maugham, the director of the Good Law Project, said: “Now we know what Boris Johnson and his advisers think about the awful sacrifices people up and down the country have made. They think sacrifices are for the ‘small’ people – but not for ‘great’ people like them. But the law says we are all equal … and the Metropolitan police need to apply it.” Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said the cabinet secretary’s investigation into Christmas parties could be ended quickly if the prime minister admitted what happened. “We’ve got the cabinet secretary investigating whether a party happened in the prime minister’s own building. He could end that investigation now by admitting that it happened to get the cabinet secretary back doing the work of the government,” he said.",News/Politics,No 10 says its Christmas party is cancelled due to Omicron concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/10/no-10-says-its-christmas-party-is-cancelled-due-to-omicron-concerns
12/11/2021,"Political satire may not usually be considered in their wheelhouse, but this week Ant and Dec were given a shoutout during Prime Minister’s Questions after the presenters referenced the alleged Downing Street Christmas party on I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, cited the joke as he pressured Boris Johnson into admitting he had been aware of the Christmas party hosted at No 10 while London was under tier 3 restrictions last year. Starmer said the duo were “ahead of the prime minister on this.”  He was referencing a gag on Tuesday night’s episode, in which Ant remarked of the celebrity contestants: “They categorically deny that they had a party. And this fictional party definitely didn’t involve cheese and wine or a secret Santa.” Dec added: “Evening, prime minister … for now.” Political and media experts who spoke to the Guardian said the joke transcended political differences of opinion because it spoke to the prevailing view that Johnson is untrustworthy, and reflected the fact the pandemic restrictions are seen as a human issue – not just a political one. They also warned the prime minister that, if Ant and Dec have trained their own brand of cheeky irreverence on to him, it was a good indicator that his recent controversies were resonating with the public. “If Ant and Dec pick it up like that it’s because they feel the pulse of the country better than the politicians, and it’s what everyone’s talking about,” said Lis Howell, a professor emeritus of journalism at City, University of London and a former broadcasting executive. She added: “Ant and Dec are universally popular and therefore very influential. They’re more damaging than any pundits. It’s the court jester who has the power to mock the king, but it’s no good mocking the king unless there’s some truth in it.” The “evening, prime minister” refrain has punctuated a series of jibes about Johnson on the show, including describing contestants’ role as to “look increasingly dishevelled, give cushy jobs to their mates and pretty much make it up as they go along”. On Wednesday night, Ant reprised the double entendre between the celebrity contestants and the prime minister, remarking: “you can’t get way with covering things up”. The pair’s foray into political comedy has prompted an outpouring of support on social media from viewers, who praised their candid remarks and commented on how they were an unlikely force to bring down the government. It also represents a considerable departure from Ant and Dec’s usual comedic style and the type of jokes considered appropriate for mass entertainment shows, which are notoriously wary of offending viewers. Matthew Flinders, a politics professor at Sheffield University, said Johnson’s role as the UK’s first “celebrity prime minister” had blurred the boundaries between politics and entertainment by “building his reputation on joking around, not taking things seriously and breaking conventions”. The inclusion of political humour may have been a deliberate decision by I’m a Celebrity’s producers to revive slumping ratings for what is increasingly seen as an ailing format. “Prime time entertainment shows like this tend to avoid politics because it polarises the audience and is generally dull and serious, but Boris embraces slapstick. The producers of I’m A Celebrity will have inserted the gag into Ant and Dec’s script as a tester, and it resonated immediately. The PR machine needs constant topicality and cut-through so it remains in people’s minds,” said Julian Henry, an entertainment PR expert. Last year, I’m a Celebrity was still pulling in an average of 11 million viewers nightly, but this week ratings averaged just 5.2 million nightly, according to BARB figures. This season has been beset by problems, including cancelled episodes due to storm Arwen and the early exit of contestant Richard Madeley for a medical emergency. While the political jokes haven’t translated into higher ratings yet, they have generated headlines in a way not seen since the show’s heyday. Their popularity may reflect a gap in television programming for a satirical show which can keep up with social media. I’m a Celebrity is one of the few shows that films live nightly, unlike the UK’s main political satire, Have I Got News For You, which records weekly. “News and politics travels so fast now so a lot of the jokes we were sharing yesterday aren’t the same ones we’re sharing today,” said Scott Bryan, a culture writer. Bryan added that the fact ITV had a clip of the joke on social media “within minutes” helped it go viral. “It’s a strategy at a time when television is incredibly competitive,” he said. “As well as attracting people who’d always watch the show, they’re getting other people writing and talking about them.”",Arts/Television & radio,"Ant and Dec party jokes should be a warning to Johnson, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/10/ant-and-dec-party-jokes-should-be-a-warning-to-johnson-say-experts
12/11/2021,"The supreme court ruled on Friday that Texas abortion providers can sue over the state’s ban on most abortions, but the justices are allowing the law, the strictest such regulation in America to date, to remain in effect. The decision is a mixed result for reproductive health advocates at a time when social conservatives seem on the march in America and the supreme court is leaning towards outlawing abortion nationally in the future with its conservative supermajority, engineered by Donald Trump.  The Texas law is unusual in that it relies on the public, rather than the authorities, to sue those suspected of performing an abortion or aiding in the service, although not the patient undergoing the termination. In a brief, the Biden administration had taken the unusual step of telling justices they could grant the Texas law full review and decide its fate this term. The court already heard arguably the most consequential abortion rights case in decades, a case called Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which challenges Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban. The case is a direct challenge to Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 case that legalized abortion nationally to the point a fetus can survive outside the womb, generally regarded at 24 weeks gestation. Conservatives on the court appeared inclined to uphold the Mississippi law, which would require an opinion to either overturn or substantially weaken Roe. A decision in that case is expected in June 2022. The law in Texas has been in effect since September, aside from a district court-ordered pause that lasted 48 hours. It bans abortions once cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks and before many women know they are pregnant. While courts have blocked other state laws effectively banning abortion before a fetus can survive outside the womb, the Texas law has so far avoided a similar fate because it leaves enforcement up to private citizens, a move that many critics have said effectively creates anti-abortion bounty hunters. The law allows anyone, anywhere to bring a suit against anyone who helps a woman obtain an abortion, and provides a $10,000 penalty against defendants found to violate the law. Meanwhile, a judge in Texas had ruled on Thursday that the law violated the state’s constitution because it allows private citizens to sue abortion providers. State district court judge David Peeples was ruling on the law but abortion providers had already signaled that despite the ruling, they were unlikely to resume the procedure until the supreme court announced its decision. Texas Right to Life, an anti-abortion group that backed the law, immediately filed an appeal against Thursday’s ruling in the state, the second most populous in the US.",News/Law,Supreme court rules Texas abortion providers can sue over ban but won’t stop law,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/dec/10/supreme-court-texas-abortion-ban-law
12/11/2021,"Great to hear that a 57-year-old Downing Street man is keen to help the police with their inquiries into a growing number of potential misdemeanours at his address. Boris Johnson says that “of course” he will tell the Met the truth, which pretty much guarantees they’ll never get to the bottom of it. When you want Sherlock Holmes but have to settle for Elizabeth Holmes. Still, here he comes – Shagatha Christie, trying to deduce what the hell has happened this week. Happy to help: the sphincter of his prime ministership has failed. Tory MPs whose inboxes now resemble something designed by Lulu Lytle are reminded that character is fate. There was simply no other place a Johnson government would ever end up but mired in rampant lies, chaos, negligence, financial sponging and the live evisceration of public service. To the Conservatives and media outriders somehow only now discovering this about their guy, I think we have to say: you ordered this. Now eat it.  To self-styled classics expert Johnson, meanwhile, we should extend our sympathies. Dude … worst last-days-of-Rome EVER?! Instead of bacchanalian orgies and high-end decadence, you’re back on the nappies while taking blitzkrieg for some naff Secret Santa “do” at which a press officer was reportedly handing out prizes to other press officers. Still, I hope the prizes were free girlfriends. Give them something they need. We’ll get to the parties and the gold wallpaper and the institutionalised mendacity in a minute, but while we’re vaguely on the police, many have noticed a certain investigative sluggishness on their part over the number of Covid rule-breaching events that may or may not have taken place last Christmas in the very house where the government makes the rules for the rest of us idiots. Do you detect the same? If so, at least someone’s doing some detecting. I know most crimes have now effectively been legalised by lack of investigation, but it would be nice to think the Met might at least be able to chase down potential law breaches in buildings that have multiple serving police officers in and around them at all times. Mind you, when you think of all the people who restrain themselves to death in police stations without any coppers seeing anything, you can quite see how officers might miss a big cheese-and-wine party just yards from their various sentry points. It all depends on the sightlines, no doubt. Anyway: standards. Apparently Johnson’s current independent standards adviser, Lord Geidt, is considering quitting after it turns out the prime minister misled him in his investigation into how the welfare king and queen of No 10 treated themselves to a load of hugely expensive stuff for their flat on other people’s dime. Picture Boris and Carrie looking in their rattan mirror (Soane, price on application) and going: “We DESERVE this.” If Geidt does walk, Johnson will have disgusted two standards advisers in just over 12 months. Two! I’m not going to twee this up with the Lady Bracknell quote – it doesn’t remotely cover it. Try and imagine Lady Bracknell going back to Armie Hammer’s place; now you’re in the ballpark. In the meantime, Boris Johnson’s standards adviser is starting to look like the old al-Qaida number three position. Dead men’s shoes. Speaking of shoes, other lockdown-breaking gatherings are being alleged, including one reportedly held by Carrie Johnson in the No 10 flat last November, in the immediate wake of a Kansas farmhouse landing on Dominic Cummings. After this, milady seems to have thought the ruby slippers would pass automatically to her, but this week they are beginning to look more like footwear for Liz Truss. (Rishi Sunak’s slippers are made of actual rubies.) Were journalists at any of these parties? That is a line of inquiry/rumour, reminding you just how incestuous the political-media complex is in this backwater country. I keep reading that a journalist is godfather to the Johnsons’ son, Wilfred. Then again, maybe the prime minister has had so many kids it’s like jury service. Every UK adult should expect to be called as godparent at some point. Either way, getting too close to politicians on either side of politics is always a mistake for journalists: you might think the access makes them a great contact, but the compromises and self-editing required to retain them means that ends up being just a lie you tell yourself. And, by extension, your readers. Telling me the REAL story of the election only after it’s been won or lost is for courtiers. Professional pride or your terrible social life. Pick a lane. Staying with the subject of rigorous independence, though, what a hoot to learn that the entire investigation into Downing Street parties will be carried out by the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, a certified wet blanket whose earlier appointment procedure was once characterised by Dominic Cummings as: “I brought in Simon Case … because I thought the prime minister is not listening to me.” Sorry, but why is the person deciding who should be subject to disciplinary consequences on a team he works closely with ALSO the person who decides what those consequences are? I guess it’s Johnson’s world. We just live in it. And what a world. The sheer clusterfuckery of it this week means we’ve barely time to even discuss Johnson or Johnsons’ intervention in that ex-Marine’s Kabul pet evacuation – a saga on which we’ll slap the title The Animals Give Farthing Wood. I’m kidding, of course. A lot of people anthropomorphise their animals. You know the sort of thing. “My dog loves Homes Under the Hammer.” “My guinea pig is sulking.” “My cats are high-value Taliban targets.” As for Dominic Raab, in any other week we’d have been boggling at the Foreign Office whistleblower’s claims that as capacity for removals from Afghanistan tragically dwindled, the foreign secretary was asked to personally approve individual cases, but “took several hours … to engage”, then asked for the relevant files to be resubmitted in a different kind of spreadsheet. According to Raab, that’s “not quite right”. Not quite? Wonder how he did put it. Maybe: “I’m not interested in appeals for desperate people and their children not to be murdered unless they’re correctly formatted.” Previous flights of fancy in this column might have cast Dominic Raab as kind of guy who owns a lock-up with a chest freezer. This underestimated him. I now realise he combines the calm psychopathy of a medieval steppe warlord with the fist-gnawingly obdurate “desk hygiene” of a regional manager. Regional manager of either a photocopier firm or a forced resettlement programme. Regrettably, though, space constraints must end our recap of the week here. But on it all goes, as Omicron closes in. We’ll play out with a reminder that in a pandemic that has so far killed 146,000 of the Britons who these people are supposed to be in politics to serve, the absolutely vital public health message has now TWICE been most fatally undermined by people who worked at the very heart of No 10 with Boris Johnson. That is absolutely a disgrace, and absolutely not a coincidence. Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,What’s the truth about lockdown-busting parties at No 10?

12/11/2021,"Parliament’s intelligence watchdog has said it was misled by the government when it failed to reveal that a former GCHQ boss had been allowed to resign quietly after it emerged he had helped a paedophile priest to avoid jail. The intelligence and security committee (ISC) said it had been assured that Robert Hannigan had quit for “family reasons” in 2017, only to discover from a media report two years later that the truth had been covered up with the approval of the then prime minister, Theresa May.  The ISC complained in its annual report that it had been “misled on the issue” and added that when “the head of an intelligence agency steps down unexpectedly … this committee must be fully informed of the circumstances.” It accused the former national security adviser Mark Sedwill of giving unsatisfactory answers after committee members read about why Hannigan had quit in a report in the Mail on Sunday, which accused May of “presiding over a cover-up”. “Given the investigative powers with which we trust our intelligence community, it is imperative that they are above all suspicion,” the ISC said. The cross-party committee, chaired by the Conservative MP Julian Lewis, has oversight of GCHQ and Britain’s other intelligence agencies, MI5 and MI6. It holds its meetings in secret but publishes an unclassified annual review and other reports giving more details of its scrutiny activity. Hannigan was criticised for appearing in a Channel 4 documentary, The Hunt for Jihadi John, after he had left GCHQ. The ISC complained that in the programme “he provided operational details” as to how the Britain’s intelligence agencies identified the Briton Mohammed Emwazi as the notorious Islamic State killer. Hannigan said in the documentary that Emwazi was identified by “his size, his hands but above all his voice”. ISC inquiries established that Hannigan’s participation had not been cleared by the government and that the only sanction taken against him was that his successor, Sir Jeremy Fleming, sent him a letter of advice reminding him “to seek approval” before appearing in the media in future. The cross-party committee said it was surprised “that a previous head of one of those organisations can appear on television and divulge those secrets and yet no substantive action can be taken”, and this sent “entirely the wrong message” to those who may be tempted to breach the secrecy rules in the future. Hannigan resigned as head of the signals intelligence agency in April 2017 after two and a half years in the job. It was briefed that he was stepping down principally to look after his ill wife and two elderly parents. It subsequently emerged that the National Crime Agency had discovered that Hannigan provided a character reference in the 2013 trial of Father Edmund Higgins, a Catholic priest who was found guilty of possessing 174 child abuse images. The reference helped the priest avoid jail; instead he received an eight-month suspended sentence. Hannigan resigned at a time when Higgins was again under police investigation, this time under the name Edmund Black. He was subsequently jailed for 31 months in June 2018 after pleading to guilty to further charges involving child abuse images. The court heard that Higgins would watch and share child abuse videos, including one that involved a baby. The national security adviser told the ISC that the intelligence watchdog had not been told about the real reason for Hannigan’s departure because the police inquiry was ongoing and the information needed to be held within a restricted group. “It would not have been appropriate to share information outside this group, including with the ISC, during the investigation,” Sedwill wrote.",News/UK news,Watchdog says it was misled over reason for GCHQ boss’s resignation,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/10/watchdog-says-it-was-misled-over-reason-for-gchq-boss-resignation
12/11/2021,"For quite a loud woman, it’s amazing how hard Judith Howell had to work to get heard. Howell, 49, used to be a government lobbyist, and she noticed a well-known phenomenon: “It’s incredibly male-dominated, and I’d find that if I said something it would get picked up by someone else in the meeting as if they’d said it. So I’d have to push a bit harder, be a bit more strident, literally interrupt and – not shout, but raise my voice. And some people found that very annoying.” Howell cheerfully admits that she has a loud voice. “I grew up in a family of boys,” she boomed. “And I learned to sing at a young age, so I know how to project.” As a rowing coach, when she gives instructions to her crew from the riverbank, she can be heard from nearly a mile away.  In a career that required the ability to make a case as forcefully as possible, she didn’t see anything wrong with it. But sometimes she would be taken aside and told she was overconfident, or pushy. “And I’d think – I’m literally doing the same thing as the men.” For women like Howell, who know that they are loud because they are passionate or confident, being asked to be quiet is more than just a sexist insult: it can have severe professional consequences. This week, a physicist at Exeter University struck a small blow in their defence. Dr Annette Plaut, who was sacked by the university after a 30-year career, won a claim for unfair dismissal after she claimed that her bosses could not tolerate her “naturally loud” voice, or her demonstrative body language. To Sara, an academic in Leeds, the story was all too resonant: anonymous student feedback from her lectures complained that she was “too loud”. “I felt a bit embarrassed when I first read it,” she said. “But then I also felt a bit indignant! It’s one of the comments that’s stuck with me despite my best efforts. I do often wonder if I’m being too loud in a class, but then usually only in retrospect. When I’m in the middle of teaching, it doesn’t cross my mind.” She has never heard of a male colleague getting similar feedback. She notices something similar among her students, where the men are “consistently louder’ and women are “constantly railroaded,” something she tries to mitigate. For her own part, she “needs to convey a certain level of authority and confidence” in class – and she is “quite self-conscious about seeming overbearing and too gregarious”. She said all this via email, as she’s recently lost her voice. If women like Sara face such perceptions in the workplace, it seems to be echoed in the public sphere. It is striking to think about the celebrities who are seen as loud – and reflect that whereas for Brian Blessed or Dom Joly, it is largely viewed as a source of entertainment, women like Margaret Thatcher and Angela Rayner are routinely viewed as strident or difficult. Even Adele is seen as overpoweringly gobby – and she’s a singer. Sonia Mortlock’s experience suggests that horror at a loud woman can be multiplied when race is also a factor. Mortlock, a retired 67-year-old who lives in Southend, is of Jamaican heritage, and says that in her former job at a housing association she endured “frequent comments about the tone and volume of my voice, even when I thought I was being perfectly respectful and polite”. “I do have a loud voice,” she said. “But I’m not rude. People said I had an aggressive attitude.” She would see white men “literally shouting in meetings and nothing would happen,” she added. “And so sometimes I did become indignant, and that just made matters worse.” Eventually, she lost her job because she didn’t want to move from a four-day to a five-day week. She brought an unfair dismissal claim. “The judge was very quiet, and when I spoke he told me he wouldn’t tolerate raised voices. But again, I was just speaking in my normal voice.” That was when she knew she would lose. To Emma Wainer, a corporate speaking coach who runs a coaching programme called Influential Leadership for Women, these are familiar stories. “Women in the workplace have two spaces available to them – the kind, appeasing, gentle woman, and the absolute bitch.” They don’t even have to be especially noisy, she noted. “If women use more masculine turns of phrase, more direct language, shorter sentences, gesture, and if they combine that with a higher pitch, they will be labelled as difficult.” If it isn’t always easy to adapt the way we speak, that may be because the factors that make a person loud are deeply embedded. “Nature is a part of it – if we take voice pitch as an analogue for this, it can be affected by body size, hormones, gender differentiation,” said Mark Huckvale, professor of speech science at University College London. “But that’s a small component compared to the nurture side of it. It varies across cultures, and people’s positions within society, and whether we’re expected to be submissive or dominant.” Then there’s the way that our own hearing can affect how loud we think we need to be. “You can have very large differences in hearing across individuals without being considered to have an impairment. But that feedback loop is very important in judging the level of your voice.” Howell, for her part, did try to be quieter at work. “And I ended up incredibly depressed, because I simply wasn’t being me. I’ve spent decades creating this professional self, and all of a sudden it’s gone.” She ended up leaving her lobbying job and becoming a gardener. “It’s lovely,” she said. “The plants don’t mind, and they don’t talk back.”",Lifestyle/Life and style," ‘Pushy, gobby, rude’: why do women get penalised for talking loudly at work",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/10/pushy-gobby-rude-why-do-women-get-penalised-for-talking-loudly-at-work
12/11/2021,"On the morning of 3 December, Priyantha Kumara, the 49-year-old export manager of Rajco Industries, asked his workers to remove a sticker from a machine in their factory in Sialkot. Kumara, a Sri Lankan, had lived in the industrial town in Punjab since 2010, when he and his two brothers had come to Pakistan in search of better economic opportunities. The Kumaras worked hard, kept their heads down, and like migrants the world over had managed to build honest lives out of their lonely labour. The sticker in question had been put up by supporters of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a hardline Islamist party that in April 2021 was declared a militant organisation by prime minister Imran Khan’s government. Khan has been nicknamed Captain U-Turn by his opponents, and proceeded to remove the ban on the TLP a mere six months later, bending to the fundamentalist outfit when they took to the streets in a dharna or protest. Khan himself had popularised the dharna as a form of political strategy during his opposition days, and though the TLP’s agitation was violent, killing as many as six policemen as they rampaged through the streets of Lahore, Khan responded by taking them off the terror list.  Kumara had lived in Pakistan long enough to know to stay away from our serpentine politics. He wanted the sticker removed because he was a diligent and professional manager, and the factory was to undergo a whitewash ahead of a delegation of visitors arriving. When the workers refused, he removed the sticker himself, at which point some of his young employees erupted in a fury, accusing Kumara of blasphemy – religious verses had been printed on the sticker – and exhorting their co-workers to kill him. In Pakistan, to accuse someone of blasphemy is a death sentence. You can denounce someone without even clarifying how exactly they blasphemed – lest you commit blasphemy yourself – so the charge is often used to settle enmities, land disputes or petty vendettas. Hundreds of factory workers chased Kumara, tearing his clothes and beating him. A co-worker tried to shield Kumara, protecting him with his own body, but he could not hold back the angry young men for long. After they broke Kumara’s bones, they dragged him out to the road and set him alight. The killers, all young men and boys, shouted TLP slogans and took selfies for their social media feeds, standing next to the black smoke of what the Pakistani journalist Zarrar Khuhro called their “human bonfire”. For timid men to erupt in sudden violence in south Asia is not new, we are a riotous subcontinent – but the selfies, those are new. One of the men who posed in front of Kumara’s burning body was captured by another lens. Holding his camera up above his face as he glared into the screen, one could read the writing on this back of his smartphone: “Apna time ayega,” it said, citing the lyrics of a popular Bollywood rap song. My time will come. Though Khan himself condemned the blasphemy killing and the military declared “zero tolerance” for extremists, not everyone was in full accord. Pervez Khattak, Pakistan’s doddering defence minister, told the press that there was no link between the murderous lynching and the government’s flip-flopping and unbanning of the TLP. “Murders take place,” he opined, when young men are emotional. “When you were in college, were you also not emotional?” he asked a journalist. There has been no recognition that enraged men like this tend also to be victims of a poorly imagined globalisation. Men who left rural communities for cities in search of wealth and opportunity, only to find that nothing awaited them except the “glittering misery” of urban life. Unheard and unseen, these angry men toil with no future and few prospects ahead of them. They are the casualty of so many colliding forces, both social and political, that exploit their dreams of liberty and economic security, using them for cheap labour – Rajco Industries makes sportswear for export, shiny workout gear sold for hundreds of dollars – in return for a suffocating and crushing invisibility. This invisibility is the source of a chilling rage, a murderous undercurrent travelling beneath us at all times. It spares no one, not the young, not the old, infecting everyone equally. A viral video of a stray dog in Islamabad was recently uploaded to social media. Though the shivering, frightened dog averts its eyes from the humans that surround it, the squeaky, babyish voice of a young girl, a child, can be heard off-camera: “I want to rip it to pieces,” she says, in a tinny, cartoon-like voice. Across the border in India, where Narendra Modi’s rightwing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has held power for the last seven years, the cases of lynchings are too many and too grotesque to count. The Indian right has all but made living as a Muslim a crime, and routinely paints Muslims as jihad-hungry fifth columnists: Muslim men who marry Hindu women are accused of committing “love jihad”. Recently, saffron-clad mobs assembled in Gurgaon, a Delhi satellite, with the sole purpose of stopping Muslims from performing their daily prayers. “There will be no namaz here,” screamed angry Hindu fundamentalists. When Muslims, with fewer and fewer mosques to pray in, began to offer their prayers outside on the dirt of Gurgaon’s open roadsides, the furious men howled that they would not tolerate Muslim “land jihad”. “What counts today, the question which is looming on the horizon,” wrote the political philosopher Frantz Fanon, “is the need for a redistribution of wealth. Humanity must reply to this question or be shaken to pieces by it.” The collective rage shimmering in the subcontinent is set against a paper-thin political fragility: the fragility of our leaders, small men who cannot stomach criticism or make the effort to care for a wounded and terrified citizenry; the fragility of majorities who refuse to cede any ground to minorities; the fragility of damaged men whose hearts are broken and cannot express themselves except through unhinged acts of cruelty; and the fragility of the rich who are blind to the anxieties of the dispossessed all around them.

But with too much sugar linked to serious health conditions, how can we wean ourselves off it? I asked Graham MacGregor, chairman of campaign group Action on Sugar. Graham, I always joke that the only thing I stand to inherit from my family is diabetes. But recently I’ve been taking it seriously and cutting out sugar. It’s hard.Well, it’s stuffed into everything.  I hate the impenetrable names – dextrose, sucrose, fructose. Why can’t they just say “sugar”?That’s just one of the tricks of the food industry. Like how they’ll say something is made without added sugar because it uses a fruit concentrate. That’s still sugar. Refined sugar is a concentrate – just of cane or beet. The industry gets away with murder. You have experience fighting the food industry – you also founded Action on Salt, which successfully campaigned for industry-wide salt reduction. Are salt and sugar comparable?They’re both hidden in vast amounts in our food, to make bad ingredients taste good cheaply, and are linked to problems such as obesity and heart disease. And they’re addictive. Addictive? Really?OK, well, if I’m being scientific I’d say they lead to habituation. Our salt taste receptors get suppressed over time, so you need more to get a salty taste. Same for sugar. Look, I’m not a sugar nut who thinks every health problem is sugar’s doing. But the evidence for healthy food’s positive impact is overwhelming. What change would you like to see?The same thing as salt: targets set for gradual sugar reduction. Now, food in the supermarket has 20 to 40% less salt and no one’s noticed. The issue with sugar is reformulating the products. So if a biscuit is roughly 40% sugar … Oh man, a biscuit is my only treat …Don’t have biscuits. If you took out half the sugar, you’d lose a lot of bulk. Would you accept a smaller biscuit? I’d choose a smaller one over no biscuit.The point is, they’d need to put something back into the biscuit, a bulking ingredient that does the same as sugar but has fewer calories. The food industry is actually working on an ingredient like that. That’s positive! Plus there are junk food bans coming – on advertising at the end of 2022; on buy-one-get-one-free promotions from April. Perhaps sugar will go the same way as salt.The salt issue isn’t over. Action on Salt was lucky: it was a Labour government and they’d set up the Food Standards Agency to be beyond ministerial control. Then the Conservatives got in. I think Andrew Lansley was on the side of the food industry, because he made it responsible for policing itself. As one of my colleagues said, it was like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank. They stopped reducing salt further – we did a report about how many deaths this was responsible for. But the bans would be good.If they happen. Could artificial sweeteners be useful?There’s no evidence they’re toxic, but are they good? One has to be sceptical when there’s big money involved, even if it’s a natural sweetener. An oleander leaf can kill you and it’s natural – it’s probably the most dangerous poison out there. Actually, maybe novichok is. Graham! I do not want to think about novichok.

The various components can be made quickly and kept aside to be assembled as one, so, if you need to, take your time and space out the work over a few days. I’m going for triple chocolate here, but without making it sickly; the base is dark, crunchy and salted, the filling delicate and the topping slightly sharp and creamy.

In a stand mixer with the paddle attachment or in a food processor, combine all of the dry ingredients and mix well. Add in the butter and mix again until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Pour in the golden syrup and mix until a very loose dough forms. Spread this out on a large baking tray lined with greaseproof paper, and bake at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for 35-40 minutes, stirring it every 15 minutes so it bakes evenly. Leave to cool completely, then blitz to crumbs (or break up with a rolling pin). Weigh out 250g of the crumb mix (the excess will keep well in an airtight container for two weeks; sprinkle over ice-cream or through an ice-cream base just before freezing, or mix through buttercream if you’re decorating a cake), then stir in the melted butter to coat. Press the buttery crumb mix into a 20cm loose-bottomed tart tin so it covers the bottom and goes up the sides, then chill while you make the filling. Soak the gelatine in ice-cold water until soft, then squeeze out and set aside. Warm the cream, milk, salt and honey in a medium pan until steaming, then add the softened gelatine and stir to dissolve. Pour over the chopped chocolate, leave to sit for a minute, then stir with a whisk until the chocolate melts. Leave to cool, then chill for four to six hours, until set. In the bowl of a stand mixer, whip the cooled panna cotta mixture for a minute or two, until it turns silky, then spoon over the crumb base and smooth out the top. In the bowl of a stand mixer (or by hand), whisk the creme fraiche, cream, vanilla (if using), salt and sugar to soft peaks, then spoon on top of the panna cotta.

12/11/2021,"Hamilton 10/10 Without doubt Hamilton’s trump card, with 15 seasons and seven world championships under his belt, including several that have gone to the wire. He will bring a calm confidence to this final test. This year he appears particularly unfazed by the pressure and his decision-making and judgment are as sharp as ever, drawing on the lessons learned from a remarkable career. There is no more formidable opponent on the grid.  Verstappen 7/10 Far from a newbie, the Dutchman is now in his seventh season in F1 but crucially this is his first title fight. He is far from lacking in self-belief and has shown great composure and some absolutely flawless performances this season to reach this stage but must now prove himself in the heat of a crucible he has never experienced. A test like no other for the 24-year-old. Hamilton 7/10 Has long-since addressed what he felt was a weak point in his game in qualifying and made great strides. Yet this year he has been unable to match Verstappen, much as he has often extracted more than might be expected. Sensitive to how well the car finds its sweet spot, especially vital in the limited running of qualifying, the single-lap test in the Mercedes this season has proved perhaps the toughest he has encountered since 2014, so is battling more variables than Verstappen. Verstappen 8/10 Has outscored Hamilton in poles this year by nine to five. Verstappen has delivered some of the best qualifying laps of his career and has outperformed his car even on tracks not suited to the Red Bull. Yet has also shown moments of frailty, notably in grasping to overachieve, in failing to slow for yellow flags that cost him in Qatar and on an absolute monumental lap in Saudi Arabia, when going too hard into the final corner was massively costly. Hamilton 9/10 Hamilton’s racecraft has been acknowledged throughout his career from the very earliest days in karting. He has honed it since with an ability to read races, to manage his tyres to perfection and to find pace where others flounder. There is a sharp racing intelligence behind the natural talent and reactions, displayed earlier this season, in being circumspect wheel-to-wheel with Verstappen and in the latter stages in scything through the pack in Brazil. Verstappen 8/10 Aggressive, yes, and steadfastly unafraid to get his elbows out, but Verstappen now also brings a much more measured and calculated tone to his racing. This season for all the on-track tussles with Hamilton he has largely brought great precision to his instincts. Has come through the field brilliantly, notably in Russia from the back of the grid, and has shown an intelligent grasp of strategy. Yet still there is the chink of his single-mindedness proving costly when the bigger picture is at stake, as Monza proved. Hamilton 10/10 Has always pushed to make himself stronger physically and mentally and is perhaps now in better shape in both than at any point in his career. His refusal to be bowed by circumstances has been rightly recognised. Setbacks and frustrations are of course bemoaned but then discarded as he immediately looks to find ways around them with a fearsome, relentless focus. Will not be distracted by the occasion. Verstappen 8/10 “I never even think of the mental side of things because I never had any issues. I just enjoy it and drive as fast I can,” Verstappen has pointedly noted. With the confidence of youth he has not gone far wrong doing so and has ridden setbacks well this season, not least in coping with losing a 32-point lead within two races. No quitter but he is, however, in uncharted territory now and under the psychological pressure of the biggest moment of his career. Simply driving fast might not be enough. Hamilton 7/10 The world champion will be more than aware of the dangers of a DNF and that Verstappen enjoys the win-rate advantage. He will have to be wary of lunges that he knows the Dutchman will be unafraid to try, as he did at Monza, which ended in the gravel trap for both of them. Hamilton will have to balance the risk-reward ratio to a finer margin than his rival. Verstappen 8/10 The two drivers are tied on points at 369.5 apiece but crucially Verstappen remains the championship leader by virtue of having won nine races to Hamilton’s eight. It is, after 21 meetings, a potentially crucial advantage. Should neither driver finish Verstappen will be champion based on win countback and he will know this going into a risky move with the potential to eliminate them both, attacking or defensive, although the FIA has warned that a deliberate offence could carry a points deduction.

12/11/2021,"The Spider-Man star, Tom Holland, has revealed he is considering quitting acting at the age of 25 as part of a premature “mid-life crisis”. Holland, who was promoting the latest instalment of the Marvel series, said he was considering giving up acting to return to his dancing roots, after he played Billy Elliott on the West End as a child.“I don’t even know if I want to be an actor,” he told Sky News in an interview to promote his new film.“I started acting when I was 11 and I haven’t done anything else, so I’d like to go and do other things. Genuinely, I’m sort of … having a midlife crisis – at 25, I’m having like a pre-midlife crisis.”The actor revealed this week that he has signed up to play Fred Astaire in an upcoming biopic, a move that could signal the beginning of his career shift.Holland acknowledged a debt to the Spider-Man franchise in enabling him to “do some amazing things”. The latest film, No Way Home, is expected to be the biggest of the year – possibly ever – with pre-sales outstripping that of Avengers: Endgame (2019) ahead of its UK release on 15 December.Holland is not the first actor to tire quickly of the profession. Greta Garbo announced a “temporary” retirement at the age of 36 in 1941, while she was still one of the biggest box office draws in the world, which lasted 49 years – until her death in 1990.Although it’s not fully understood why, Garbo is believed to have been a private, introverted person who struggled with the spotlight cast on her through fame, and who perhaps pre-empted the declining opportunities at the time for female actors as their youthful beauty faded.More recently, the Game of Thrones star Jack Gleeson retired after the series finished. He told Entertainment Weekly that he had been acting since he was 8 and had “stopped enjoying it as much as I used to”. He said that earning a living from acting had changed his relationship with his craft compared with the “therapeutic” benefits he had enjoyed when it was just a hobby. He subsequently enrolled in a theology and philosophy degree at Trinity College Dublin.  Gleeson’s shift to academia is perhaps more unusual than Holland’s mooted move, since there is infamously a revolving door between different branches of the arts.

12/11/2021,"For Misha Novitskyi, the question of whether Russia will invade Ukraine is not theoretical. The enemy is just 50 metres away behind a concrete slab. From time to time Russian voices float eerily across a wintry no man’s land of ragged trees and scrub. “When they light their stoves you can see the smoke,” Novitskyi – a senior lieutenant in the Ukrainian army – said, speaking from what is in effect Europe’s eastern front with Russia. He added: “Every day they shoot at us.”  The conflict between Kyiv and pro-Russian separatists has gone on for nearly eight long years. There are first world war echoes. Both sides face off along a fixed 250-mile “border” or line of contact which snakes across Ukraine’s Donbas region. There are muddy trenches, fortified command posts and buildings smashed up by shell fire. Novitskyi defends a former textiles factory. It is now a ghostly and roofless ruin. On a wall someone has scrawled a helpful reminder: “Fuck up and you die.” All is quiet until it isn’t. On Thursday morning Ukrainian soldiers were making their way towards a nearby frontline position overlooking the city of Donetsk. The separatists are based at its wrecked airport, along what was once the runway. Three shots rang out: sniper rounds. The soldiers quickened their pace. A pheasant rose from a yellow field marked out with red signs warning of mines and unexploded ordnance. Old-fashioned metal wires connect the brigade’s forward post – an ant-hill-like embankment with bunkers and ladders – to its nearby village HQ. Much of the diplomacy of the past week is reminiscent of a bygone age too. Vladimir Putin has made no secret of his contempt for Ukraine. It is, in his view, sub-sovereign: less of a country, more an enduring zone of Russian imperial influence and control. In 2014 Putin seized Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula and installed separatist proxies in Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk, adjoining Russia. What Putin intends next is worryingly unclear. The signs are ominous. This autumn Moscow has amassed troops and heavy weapons right across Ukraine’s borders. Satellite images showing around 175,000 Russian soldiers have spooked the US and its allies. It remains unclear whether this is a negotiating tactic or buildup to invasion. On Tuesday Joe Biden spoke to Putin for two hours via video link. The US president reaffirmed his commitment to Ukraine’s territorial integrity. But he refused to offer Putin what he wants: a cast-iron guarantee that Kyiv will never join Nato. Biden on Thursday briefed Ukraine’s comedian turned president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on his talks with his Russian counterpart. Eastern European nations are concerned. They fear the US is preparing to “accommodate” the Kremlin’s apparent security concerns – thereby rewarding Moscow for solving a problem it created. Why Putin has chosen this moment to escalate tensions is a mystery. One theory is that he realises Ukraine is moving inexorably away from Moscow’s orbit. For his part, Novitskyi rejected Putin’s recent assertion made in an essay that Ukraine and Russia are “a single people”. Novitskyi said: “Russia is stuck in the Soviet past. Ukraine is travelling in another direction, towards the west and Europe. We are an independent nation. “Russia and Ukraine are not one people but black and white, yin and yang.” Earlier this week Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, toured the frontline where Novitskyi is based, at an industrial area in the city of Avdiyivka. A little way to the south is Donetsk, under rebel control since 2014. Reznikov predicts there will be a bloody massacre, should Moscow attack, with both sides taking huge casualties. For now, nobody knows whether Putin’s tanks will advance here, across a landscape of vast black fields, belching chimney stacks and Orthodox churches adorned with glinting gold cupolas. The existing conflict might seem retro in nature, but this is very much a twenty-first-century war. “We have better weapons than in the past,” Lt Alexander Tymoshuk pointed out, standing in a trench corridor fixed up with netting and reinforced with metal plates. In world war one reconnaissance involved sending out groups of men. Now surveillance cameras could detect any movement or intrusion, Tymoshuk noted. Ukraine recently used for the first time a Turkish-made drone to blow up a Russian-made howitzer. Paradoxically, those serving on the Ukrainian frontline say they are unworried by the threat of invasion. They claim Kyiv’s army is stronger, more experienced and better equipped than it was eight years ago, when it crumpled under superior Russian firepower. According to Vitaly Barabash, Avdiyivka’s mayor, Russia would soon find itself embroiled in a partisan war, were it to grab more territory. He estimated around 300,000 military veterans would pick up weapons – in contrast to 2014, when some of the patriotic volunteers who fought and died were IT workers from Kyiv. Too much blood had already been spilled on the front, he said, and on the Maidan, the central square in Kyiv where in 2014 anti-government protesters ousted Ukraine’s pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych. He added: “We won’t go back to Russia. Nobody wants to be Putin’s slave.” As Biden prepares to hold further talks with Moscow, including over Nato, people continue to die. Since September 16 members of the Ukrainian forces have been killed including a 22-year-old private shot dead last week. Most are killed by snipers or IEDs. Others are wounded. “It’s really hard to take casualties. Some strings in me are broken. I’ve become more cynical,” Lt Ivan Skuratovsky said, showing off his basement living quarters. Two cats dozed on his bed. The base has a small library and mess room, its wooden pillars decorated with drawings sent by Ukrainian schoolchildren. The civilian cost of this unresolved conflict with Russia has been enormous. The villages directly in range of hostile fire are mostly abandoned, though a few elderly residents refuse to leave. The frontline runs through Timiryazev Street, named after a Russian botanist. The street’s once-pleasant dachas are all wrecks. The gardens survive. In summer the soldiers gather walnuts, as they thread their way past on patrol. They also look after the dogs left behind when their owners left in a hurry, never to come back. In the absence of humans nature has flourished, with the odd blue tit and many crows. Since the war began Avdiyivka’s character has changed. According to Mariia Lepilova, a former teacher, the younger generation is more pro-Ukrainian. The Donbas was once mostly Russian-speaking. There had been a switch to the Ukrainian language in schools and shops, she said. Children learn Ukrainian in class from the age of six or seven. Lepilova said she was forced to leave the town in the winter of 2014, when shelling made living there impossible. “There was no power. Our house was hit. My 10-year-old daughter was very afraid. Almost everyone left,” she said. Fighting broke out again in 2017. Since then much of the population has come back, with flats rebuilt and new investment. Like many in the town she has relatives living in Donetsk, a pro-Russian enclave known as the DNR or Donetsk People’s Republic. She can no longer visit them but speaks on the phone. “We avoid politics and talk about our kids,” she said. “People can get used to anything,” she added. Previously residents of Avdiyivka visited Donetsk to go to restaurants or the cinema, or to support the city’s famous football team, FC Shakhtar Donetsk, which played in the Donbass Arena. The nearest McDonald’s is now 190 miles away in the city of Kharkiv. Lepilova said she missed the cultural life in the big city and its museum, especially its collection of Dutch paintings and Greek sculpture. “It’s the city of my youth,” she explained. Moscow’s attempt to claim the region for itself had pushed people towards embracing a Ukrainian identity, she added. Back on the airport frontline there was more sniper fire. The local brigade commander, Maj Sergei Kozachok, said his men were ready for anything the Russian side might throw at them. The separatists were constantly fortifying their positions, he said, with no visible increase in activity this week. Kozachok said his soldiers obeyed the Minsk ceasefire agreement, signed by Kyiv in 2015 under intense Russian pressure. It forbids the use of heavy weapons. Recent tensions have brought the treaty to the brink of collapse. The Ukrainian side did not fire back, he claimed, despite repeated “provocations”. What would his message to Putin be, in the unlikely event they were to meet face to face? Kozachok thought for a moment and smiled. He answered: “I would punch him on the ear.”",News/World news,‘Nobody wants to be Putin’s slave’: on the Ukraine frontline as tensions rise,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/nobody-wants-to-be-putins-slave-on-the-ukraine-frontline-as-tensions-rise
12/11/2021,"MPs have approved a new chair of the charities watchdog but criticised the way the search “became subject to allegations of political interference” as well as a lack of diversity. The Commons culture select committee approved Martin Thomas, an insurance and financial services professional and experienced charity trustee, as chair of the Charity Commission following a pre-appointment hearing on Thursday.  However, while the committee welcomed Thomas’s appointment, it said it was “regrettable” that the process had been drawn out and mired in controversy around alleged attempts by ministers to influence the process. The former culture secretary Oliver Dowden caused controversy when he wrote a Sunday Telegraph article in September saying ministers would only choose a candidate who could show they would use the commission’s power to pursue charities who stray into so-called “woke” and “political” activities. Dowden’s article came days before interviews for the commission chair took place and triggered a legal challenge from the Good Law Project, which argued that ministers were unlawfully trying to control the commission chair. There had been widespread concern that ministers would seek to appoint a partisan figure who would pursue an agenda aligned with the government’s, but MPs welcomed Thomas’s commitment to maintaining the independence of the commission. Thomas has no declared political activity. Thomas said in the pre-appointment scrutiny hearing that he believed the commission should stay as far as possible out of debates about “wokeness.” He also said he did not believe charities were “too political” and there was no need to change existing rules governing their political activity. The committee said the government should have “worked harder to ensure a more diverse pool of candidates applied for the role”, although it noted that ministers had also expressed disappointment at the lack of diversity among candidates. There were 37 applications for the £62,500-a-year role. Of the 36 that filled in a diversity monitoring form, nine were female, six were black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) and one was disabled. Of the seven who went forward to interview, one was female and one BAME. Thomas, who was educated at a public school and has a classics degree from Oxford University, told MPs he wanted charity boards to be more diverse. Being a trustee was “something for everyone”, he said, and should not be regarded solely as “an extra feather in the cap” for the middle class. Thomas has more than 20 years of experience in insurance and financial services, and worked at the Bank of England and the European Central Bank. He has chaired several charities, including the Forward Arts Foundation, which runs National Poetry Day. In confirming his appointment, the committee praised Thomas’s skills, experience and temperament, adding that he “demonstrated a sound awareness of the challenges of the sector”.",News/Politics,MPs approve new charities watchdog chair with criticism of ministers,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/10/mps-approve-new-charities-watchdog-chair-criticism-ministers

12/11/2021,"The Omicron variant has the potential to “very substantially overwhelm the NHS” and cause up to 10,000 hospitalisations a day if it is as virulent as Delta, according to a leading scientist who helped shape Britain’s coronavirus lockdown strategy. Prof Neil Ferguson, a mathematical epidemiologist from Imperial College London, said the UK was already experiencing a “very explosive wave of infection” from the new variant. This could lead to “quite an explosive wave of hospitalisations,” depending on the severity of disease caused by Omicron.  “Unfortunately, most of the projections we have right now are that the Omicron wave could very substantially overwhelm the NHS, getting up to peak levels of admissions of 10,000 people per day,” he told the Guardian. Ferguson added that the figure could be reached “sometime in January” but noted the impact on deaths was less clear. He also added the caveat that the projection was based on assumptions around the variant’s ability to evade existing protection, and the premise that Omicron was similar to Delta in terms of the severity of disease it causes. But Ferguson said: “Eeven the best case scenarios involve several-fold more admissions per day than we’re getting at the moment – we are at about 700 right now.” The stark figure of 10,000 hospitalisations a day is more than double the current highest level, with 4,582 admissions on 12 January this year. Some have been quick to point to early signs that Omicron may cause more mild disease, including former prime minister Theresa May. Ferguson said, at present, however, there was very little data on the severity of disease caused by the new variant, and that it was not necessarily the case that viruses evolved to cause less severe illness – such a situation only occurs if it favours their transmission. With Covid, as “99% of transmission occurs before anybody even gets to hospital,” the severity of disease is “a very minor selection pressure”. While there was a “little bit of a hint” in UK data of a slightly higher rate of asymptomatic infection with Omicron, Ferguson said it was too soon to say if it was good news. “It could be confounded with many other things like vaccine status [or] reinfection,” he said. “So we’ll just have to wait and see.” He cast doubt on the plan-B measures announced by the prime minister on Wednesdaybeing enough if his worst-case scenarios came true. “In the context of Delta I think the government had a clear policy that hospitalisations were manageable, deaths were relatively low, and they did not want to restrict people’s freedoms any more than they had to. I think that calculus has now changed with Omicron,” said Ferguson. Nevertheless, the measures could prove to be enough if Omicron turns out to cause much less severe disease than the Delta variant. ‘If it turns out, actually, it looks like hospital admissions may only peak at 2,000 to 3,000 a day, then it’s possible that something like plan B – maybe a little bit plan B plus – might be sufficient, given the government’s overall motivation to do the minimum possible to avoid the NHS being completely overwhelmed,” he said. But if Omicron ends up even close to the severity of Delta models suggest things could be different. “In most of those scenarios, all I would say is plan B will not be enough to stop an overwhelming wave of hospitalisations.” The hope, he added, was that the new measures would slow the spread of Omicron, potentially dropping its doubling time to four or five days. That may not sound like much, but Ferguson noted it could buy crucial time to get more booster vaccines into arms – and allow scientists to get a better understanding of the risk of people ending up in hospital. Ferguson’s team produced modelling early in the pandemic that suggested the UK would suffer 500,000 Covid deaths – before the onset of vaccines or a lockdown. But the disaster scenarios often proffered in these models are averted due to changes in government policy. Sometimes, however, the modelling just comes a cropper: in July, Ferguson said the final phase of unlocking in England would bring on 100,000 cases a day – a level that was never reached – while the peaks and troughs over the past few months have left experts sometimes scratching their heads. “I think people have been over-interpreting the ups and downs, which have been going on really since mid July,” Ferguson said. “I made the unfortunate, overconfident prediction that we’d hit 100,000 cases, which I then later apologised for, but that was a very clear multi-week exponential growth.” He added: “Since then what we’ve seen is occasional rises, occasional falls, partly coincident with relaxing measures, a lot with school holidays, and a lot with vaccine rollout. So we’ve had this gradual pattern of increasing contacts – it’s not like on ‘Freedom Day’ in July, everybody went back to normal.” Ferguson said the booster programme was already making a difference, with significant drops seen in hospitalisations and deaths, while there is evidence it may even have had an impact on infection rates in some groups. “But now, in a certain sense that progress is slightly moot given we now have a variant which has evolved specifically to not wipe out, but substantially evade that immunity we’ve built up in population,” he said. “It really is essential in the next few weeks that we get as many boosters out as possible, particularly getting high coverage in the most vulnerable groups, but frankly, across the population.”",News/World news,"Omicron could overwhelm NHS if it is as virulent as Delta, Neil Ferguson says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/omicron-could-overwhelm-nhs-if-virulent-as-delta-neil-ferguson-says

12/11/2021,"Mary, Queen of Scots used a complicated “letterlocking” process to conceal the secrets of the last letter she wrote before she was beheaded, researchers have discovered. Written in French on 8 February 1587 to Henry III, king of France from her prison cell, the letter sees Mary write that she has “been advised of my sentence: I am to be executed like a criminal at eight in the morning.  “I have asked for my papers, which they have taken away, in order that I might make my will, but I have been unable to recover anything of use to me, or even get leave either to make my will freely or to have my body conveyed after my death, as I would wish, to your kingdom where I had the honour to be queen, your sister and old ally,” writes Mary, in a translation provided by the National Library of Scotland, where the letter is held. Now an international team of researchers have found that Mary used a delicate folding process to seal the letter, ensuring that any tampering would be immediately obvious to its recipient. The researchers, from universities including King’s College London, MIT and Glasgow, are part of the Unlocking History group, and have been exploring the historical process of “letterlocking”, in which letters were folded to become their own envelopes, before envelopes were invented. Earlier this year, they managed to read an unopened letter written in 1697 without breaking its seal, using X-rays to see inside the document slice by slice, and create a 3D image. Now, as part of research that has seen them look at 250,000 letters, they have discovered the technique of the “spiral lock”, which was used by Elizabeth I as well as her executed cousin Mary, along with politicians, ambassadors and a correspondent of Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth’s spymaster. “One of the most spectacular examples of spiral locking … is Mary’s last letter,” they write in an article which was published on Friday in the Electronic British Library Journal. “The letter’s contents are powerful and moving: written on the eve of her execution, it acts not only as a letter – a document intended to be sent to and read by someone at distance – but also a last will and testament and a bid for martyrdom. It is sometimes said that writing the letter was Mary’s last act; in fact, after she wrote it, the letter had to be folded and secured shut. After writing her last message, Mary used letterlocking to prepare it for delivery.” The academics, who include Jana Dambrogio of MIT Libraries and Daniel Starza Smith from KCL, write of how challenging it is to explore the process of letterlocking, because the letter packets are “designed to be broken” by their recipients. The spiral lock requires more than 30 steps to complete, a mix of folding and slits and sometimes adhesive, to prevent unwanted readings. It is, they say, “a highly intricate technique that required time, patience and great skill: one wrong move and your locking mechanism could break and you would have to start the letter again. “The mechanics of this lock force the person opening the letter to tear the lock apart in order to access the contents,” write the academics. “Because the lock breaks in multiple places, it is impossible to piece back together in a way that would allow it to pass through the slits again; if someone thought their correspondence had been tampered with, it would be relatively simple to detect.” The article identifies the folds and slits that show that Mary’s last letter was locked, adding that “because it is written in Mary’s own hand from her prison cell, we have reasonable grounds to believe she locked it herself”. Dambrogio said: “Mary’s last letter is a document of enormous national importance in Scotland and its contents are well known. But working with it in person and figuring out its unique spiral lock was thrilling as a researcher – and a real a-ha! moment in the study of letterlocking,” “The letter is a powerful and moving document written on the eve of Mary’s execution, not only a letter but also a last will and testament of sorts. But our big discovery is that after she wrote the letter she used one of the most elaborate and secure letterlocking methods to seal it. Not only that, she uses a variation of the technique – a single large slit rather than a run of small ones – which may testify to the limited tools she had available in her final hours.” A letter by Catherine de’ Medici from 1570 and one written by Elizabeth I in 1573 to Henry III, in which she expresses her surprise at Henry’s suggestion of her possible marriage to the king’s younger brother François, are also identified by the article as having been sealed with a spiral lock. The research is part of the British Library’s exhibition Elizabeth and Mary: Royal Cousins, Rival Queens. “Letterlocking is one of the most important communication techniques the world has known, but its history is only just coming to light,” said Smith. “For some 600 years, virtually all letters were sent using letterlocking, before the invention of the modern gummed envelope in the 19th century – it was as important to epistolary communication as computer coding is to emails today. The study of letterlocking supplies us with rich information about the concern historical figures had with communication security, and it also testifies to the inventiveness and even aesthetic creativity with which they responded to these concerns. The fantastically intricate spiral lock brings all these aspects together.”",Arts/Books,"Mary, Queen of Scots ‘locked’ final letter using paper-folding, research finds",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/10/mary-queen-of-scots-locked-final-letter-using-paper-folding-research-finds
