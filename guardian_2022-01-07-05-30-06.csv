1/7/2022,"A mother who was “fixated” on suicide for more than a decade fatally drugged her two young daughters before killing herself, an inquest has heard. Tiffany Stevens, from Bolton, had feared 18-month-old Darcey Stevens and three-year-old Casey-Lea Taylor would be put into care after her death, the inquest heard.  The 27-year-old gave her children lethal substances before taking a cocktail of drugs in the murder-suicide at the family home in Little Lever on 21 January 2019. Their bodies were not discovered for about a week. Stevens had spent five years in care herself as a child and endured a “traumatic” upbringing after her father died of a drug overdose when she was five, Bolton coroner’s court was told. Stevens’s mother, Bobby-Jo, said her daughter was fixated on suicide from the age of 17. “For Tiffany, she was going into another dimension and she would live on. She just thought the world was corrupt and bad, no matter how much we tried to reason with her,” she said. Dr Adrian West, a forensic clinical psychologist told the inquest that Google searches relating to suicide methods were found on Stevens’s phone. He said she had written that she was sorry for what was going to happen but she was unable to get over her past and had a mistrust of social services. Stevens took an overdose when she was 19 and went on be referred for mental health treatment on at least eight separate occasions between August 2011 and April 2017. However, she failed to attend the appointments. She had a history of self-harm and had been diagnosed as having traits of a borderline personality disorder, the inquest heard. While both children were known to social services, the inquest heard there were no grounds for the local authority to apply for Darcey and Casey-Lea to be removed from Stevens’s care The bodies of Stevens and Casey-Lea were discovered under a duvet on a mattress in the living room, while Darcey was found in her pram near the front door of the property. The assistant coroner for West Manchester, Peter Sigee, concluded that the two children were unlawfully killed without suffering. He concluded that Stevens was of sound mind when she took her daughters’ lives and her actions would have constituted an offence of murder. He added: “This has been one of the saddest cases I have heard.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

1/7/2022,"Good morning. Novak Djokovic awaits his Australian Open fate in a Melbourne immigration hotel. New South Wales hospitals are anticipating Covid-related admissions to triple. And deadly protests in Kazakhstan has hampered the bitcoin network. Novak Djokovic is awaiting his Australian Open fate in a Melbourne immigration hotel as he mounts a legal challenge against Australia’s decision to cancel his visa. Djokovic’s lawyers succeeded in a bid to stop him from being deported on Thursday with a full hearing in the federal court now scheduled for Monday. The tennis champion spent eight hours detained at Melbourne airport overnight before Australian Border Force officials announced he had been denied entry into the country on Thursday morning. They cited a failure to meet Australia’s Covid vaccination exemption requirements. Djokovic’s wrangling with authorities over entering Australia has inadvertently highlighted a different plight: those of the refugees and asylum seekers stuck for months, and years, at the Park Hotel which has been described by detainees as a “torture cell”. The Serbian president has accused Australia of “maltreatment” of the tennis star and Djokovic’s family said he is the victim of “a political agenda” aimed at “stomping on Serbia”.  Dozens of protesters and at least 12 police officers have died during the ongoing violence in Kazakhstan, authorities claimed, as “peacekeepers” from a Russian-led military alliance arrived in the country at the request of the embattled president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. The protests were sparked by rising fuel prices in the west of the country but quickly spread to encompass other regions and turned into a general protest against corruption, poverty and inequality. Protesters are angry with Tokayev and benefactor Nursultan Nazarbayev, who ruled Kazakhstan between independence in 1991 and 2019 and has remained powerful behind the scenes. The unrest in Kazakhstan – which is the world’s second-largest centre for bitcoin mining – has led to an internet blackout, significantly hampering the global computing power of the bitcoin network. Today marks the one year anniversary of the insurrection at the US Capitol when extremist Donald Trump supporters tried to overturn the official certification of Joe Biden’s presidential election victory. Biden on Thursday forcefully denounced Trump for spreading a “web of lies” about the legitimacy of the 2020 election in a desperate attempt to cling to power. Meanwhile, the special House committee investigating the 6 January 2021 insurrection are hoping to secure the cooperation of Mike Pence, the former vice-president, who certified Joe Biden’s election victory despite pressure from the White House and the violent mob that broke into the US Capitol. NSW hospitals are preparing for Covid-related admissions to triple as cases of the virus soar, forcing further cuts or delays in care that could have long-lasting health impacts, doctors and medical experts say. Covid cases have spread to remote parts of northern Australia for the first time – just days before the expected onset of the wet season that will cut road access to large swathes of the Cape York’s Indigenous communities for months. General practitioners say they are being given a “laughable” supply of vaccine for the rollout to children, warning they will struggle to inoculate them ahead of the return to school in February. Archived advice shows that health officials were warning federal and state governments about Covid testing overburden almost a year ago. They warned that widespread community transmission could see testing sites overwhelmed by demand and “alternative testing methods”, including rapid antigen testing, could help alleviate pressure. Norfolk Island is experiencing its first Covid outbreak of the pandemic, with spiralling case numbers having already forced more than 10% of the population into isolation and raising concerns about the local health system’s reliance on medical evacuations. France’s data privacy watchdog has fined Google and Facebook a combined €210m ($AU331m) for hampering users’ ability to stop the companies tracking their online activity by making it difficult for them to refuse cookies. The Spanish government has distanced itself from minister Alberto Garzón, after he told the Guardian that factory farming is damaging the environment and leading to the export of poor-quality meat. French MPs have passed the government’s controversial vaccine pass bill, which requires people to be fully vaccinated to enjoy social, sporting and cultural activities. It follows Macron’s pledge to ‘piss off’ those without jabs. When the drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico exploded in 2010, Stephen Stone escaped with his life. But in the years that followed, he came to feel deeply betrayed by the industry he had once trusted. “I didn’t think the industry was this bad,” he said. “It just kind of takes some hope from humanity, shatters your illusions a little bit.” Director Matthew Walker’s irresistibly fun and jaunty documentary I’m Wanita follows an artist you’ve most likely never heard of, but after a viewing will probably never forget: Wanita Bahtiyar, Australia’s self-professed “queen of honky tonk”, country music singer and longtime sex worker. This film shows us life dreams do not have to disappear as youth fades. Are you beset by poisonous comparisons? Try to covet what you already have, writes advice columnist Eleanor Gordon Smith, instead of feeling shame at what you lack. “Set aside some time to look at your life like an envious outsider peeping in,” she writes. “Ask what else people would say of you while thinking ‘I wish I were more like that’.” This is a replay of an episode looking at one of 2021’s landmark cases. In May last year, Australia’s Fair Work Commission ruled that Deliveroo rider Diego Franco was an employee, not a contractor. The case could have ramifications for the wider gig economy, where the use of contractors has led to widespread job insecurity, and workers are subjected to dangerous conditions. Reporter Naaman Zhou explains how the case unfolded and how, in the face of increasing pressure to give workers better rights, some companies are changing the way they operate.

1/7/2022,"If Richard Arnold studies the history of Ed Woodward, his soon-to-be predecessor as Manchester United’s most powerful executive, he will comprehend how the close season may be the sole chance to make his tenure a success. Nine summers ago Woodward appointed David Moyes as United manager after Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement and never truly recovered. The Scot lasted 34 Premier League games of a six-year contract before being sacked and Woodward’s failed search for the right No 1 extended across the next seven years as Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjær came and went without delivering a 21st title, before an interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, was brought in to allow the club to regroup.  When they did this the gun was fired on the head-hunting process for a sixth permanent United incumbent since Ferguson departed. Candidates may include Mauricio Pochettino and Brendan Rodgers but, simply, Arnold has to get the decision right. Do so, appoint a man who can make United challengers again, and all the ire Woodward suffered from disaffected fans will evaporate. Fail and Arnold will be branded as a second Woodward, his first managerial appointment will have to be removed and the pressure regarding the second will increase. Woodward believes Arnold has learned from witnessing his time in charge. Yet United can operate as a top-heavy structure, so whether Arnold can delegate more than he, Woodward and Joel Glazer, the executive co-chairman, have previously done will be vital. This, it is understood, is his aim: to give more autonomy to departmental leaders when superseding Woodward as CEO on 1 February. Arnold, who attended Bristol University like Woodward, joined United in 2007, rising to group operations manager in 2013. When discussing his candidacy for the top job, the 50-year-old informed United’s board he intended to sharpen strategy and advocate greater consultancy, while making clear the tough decisions will be made. Arnold and Woodward were drivers of United’s first football director and technical director appointments – John Murtough and Darren Fletcher respectively – a move which indicates he understands the importance of an overriding structure. Although Arnold will remain heavily involved in United’s lucrative commercial operation, Murtough and the manager will report to him. But Arnold intends to leave the football operation to them. Do so and he will, indeed, have learned from Woodward, whose downfall beyond bad management and player recruitment lay in a failure of optics: for too long a perception was allowed that he was heavily involved in all decisions regarding on-field strategy. Arnold, who is said to be data-driven and has a mixed popularity within the club, is about to strap himself into the “hell of a ride” that is leading United: the characterisation offered by Woodward, to friends, regarding a global behemoth which is also a soap opera and cultural institution. On taking over in 2013 Woodward’s task was made more challenging once Ferguson ended a glittering 26-and-a-half-year reign, having to not only replace an all-time great but drag a club geared solely to Ferguson into the 21st century. Woodward believes his legacy might have been different had Ferguson stayed on for another year. But he did not and thus Arnold had a ringside seat as Woodward went through his quartet of failed managers and a slew of scattergun signings that included Ángel Di María, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Daley Blind and Radamel Falcao. Woodward, to his credit, acknowledged these twin fault lines and tried to eradicate them. But, as United have a caretaker manager in the ongoing search for the magic candidate, the first remains. So, too, the second: the team are 22 points behind Manchester City which is, approximately, their average finishing margin to the champions of all campaigns since Ferguson left. Woodward believes if City’s Pep Guardiola or Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp had been hired they would have led United to a title. Arnold, who previously worked at PricewaterhouseCoopers and in the technology industry, is responsible, along with Woodward, for United’s admirable policy of not raising season-ticket prices for a decade. He is chair of the club’s fans’ forum, too. But unless there is a serious upturn on the pitch, he will be labelled another money man of the owners, the Glazers, who is unable to feel the invigorating pull of the game and United’s proud place in it. In 2012 Arnold said: “We don’t sign players to sell shirts. We are reliant on 25 players and they are all massive stars. We have 25 George Clooneys.” The citing of a super-rich A-list Hollywood actor here was unfortunate because it suggested United were in the business of lucrative paydays rather than focusing on claiming silverware. “We have 25 Gary Nevilles” might have been more apt. With Solskjær’s replacement of Mourinho as permanent manager in March 2019 came Woodward’s much-trumpeted strategy of a “cultural reboot”. This included having players with an “X-factor”, “attacking football”, respecting the club’s “history” and “winning”. Having to undertake this exercise, though, illustrates how lost United had become. And, really, only the final element should form a core philosophy: winning – with the championship the priority. It is what Ferguson, Sir Matt Busby and Ernest Mangnall did when creating United’s rich heritage. As Woodward heads for the exit, he claims responsibility for an overhaul of the academy, scouting and player recruitment, rating United’s football operation as only 10% away from the finished article. Given the game’s constant churn and evolution, the missing tenth may never be achieved. Arnold’s mission, then, is simple: sign the manager who can finally take United out of the post-Ferguson era, and into one defined by that next, and thus far, elusive title.",Sport/Football,Arnold must make right choice to take United out of post-Ferguson era | Jamie Jackson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/06/arnold-must-make-right-choice-to-take-united-out-of-post-ferguson-era
1/7/2022,"David Brownlow, the Tory peer who originally funded Boris Johnson’s flat refurbishment, was a keen backer of plans for a new Great Exhibition. The first Great Exhibition, in 1851, was the brainchild of Queen Victoria’s husband, Prince Albert, and took place in a huge “crystal palace” in Hyde Park, displaying 100,000 objects over more than 10 miles.  It was intended to showcase cutting-edge technology and creativity from across Britain and the empire, and from other foreign nations, including folding pianos, printing presses and early versions of bicycles. Brownlow, a trustee of the Royal Albert Hall, was inspired to create a new version of the event jointly with the London venue. Downing Street said Brownlow’s idea was referred to the culture department and he met the then secretary of state, Oliver Dowden, at the Royal Albert Hall to discuss the proposal in January 2021. It came when Brownlow was in the midst of setting up the Downing Street Trust, the vehicle designed to fund the pricy refurbishment of Boris and Carrie Johnson’s No 11 Downing Street flat. But No 10 said it decided to proceed with Festival UK instead, an event in which Brownlow is not involved. Its first incarnation was as the Festival of Brexit, proposed under Theresa May and becoming a Johnson 2019 manifesto pledge. In the manifesto, the Conservative party said: “The Festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 2022 – a national celebration which coincides with the Birmingham Commonwealth Games – will encourage our leading arts and cultural organisations, universities, research institutes and businesses to come together to inspire the next generation in British innovation and creativity.” That now has yet another iteration, Unboxed, comprising a number of projects across the UK with free events, installations and online experiences. It is part of what No 10 calls its year of celebration, which includes the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games and the Queen’s platinum jubilee. Plans for a Great Exhibition 2 may yet surface as a private endeavour. For now, Brownlow is honorary vice-president of the Windsor Platinum Jubilee Celebrations.",News/Politics,What was the Great Exhibition and why did a Tory peer want a new one? ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/06/what-was-the-great-exhibition-and-why-a-tory-peer-wanted-a-new-one
1/7/2022,"Boris Johnson has been accused of corruption after it emerged that he sought funds for his flat refurbishment from a Conservative donor while promising to consider plans for a mystery “great exhibition”. The prime minister is facing fresh questions after newly published WhatsApp messages with the Tory peer David Brownlow show Johnson called parts of his Downing Street residence a “tip” and asked for “approvals” so his decor designer, Lulu Lytle, could “get on with it” in November 2020.  He signed off the message by saying: “Ps am on the great exhibition plan Will revert.” Lord Brownlow replied: “Of course, get Lulu to call me and we’ll get it sorted ASAP! Thanks for thinking about GE2.” On Thursday, Johnson was forced to make a “humble and sincere” apology for the texts not being given to his independent ethics adviser during an initial inquiry last spring. The first Great Exhibition was held in Hyde Park in 1851. Plans for a “Great Exhibition 2.0” were discussed by Brownlow and the then culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, weeks after the WhatsApp exchanges, official records show. Asked what the great exhibition plan Johnson had referred to was, his spokesperson said it was an “idea that wasn’t taken forward”. He added that instead “Festival UK” – formerly known as the Festival of Brexit - would be going ahead in 2022 but could not explain the difference between that event and the great exhibition plan. On 18 January 2021 Brownlow held a meeting with Dowden at the Royal Albert Hall “to discuss plans for Great Exhibition 2.0”. A government source indicated it was a “private initiative” from the Royal Albert Hall, of which Brownlow is a trustee according to his register of interests. Several events similar to a “Great Exhibition 2.0” have been considered by the government. Originally conceived by Theresa May’s administration as a “Festival of Brexit”, then “Festival 2022”, the government-backed £120m event was given the green light by Johnson and will go ahead this year under the name “Unboxed”. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said it appeared Brownlow had access to Johnson and Dowden “because he was paying” for the refurbishments. She said if true, it would constitute “corruption, plain and simple”, and added: “No one should be able to buy access or exchange wallpaper for festivals.” The Liberal Democrats’ chief whip, Wendy Chamberlain, said: “It stinks of the worst kind of Conservative cronyism, with Boris Johnson seemingly happy to scratch his lord donor’s back to get his flat spruced up in return.” The WhatsApp messages were published as part of letters exchanged by Johnson and his independent ethics adviser, Lord Geidt. For a second time, Geidt found that the prime minister did not break the ministerial code over the payments for the Downing Street flat refurbishment, but Johnson was criticised for acting “unwisely”. The prime minister apologised for the texts not being handed to Geidt last spring, saying he had not remembered them and did not have access to his phone due to “security issues” – thought to relate to when his mobile number was discovered online. In thinly veiled frustration, Geidt said the saga “shook my confidence” and added that if he had seen the evidence when writing his first report, he may not have ruled that Johnson tried to make the correct declaration and seek advice at the first opportunity. While Johnson initially told Geidt he did not know Brownlow was funding £58,000 of renovations to the No 11 residence until “immediately prior to media reports”, the full details of the prime minister’s direct request for funds were published on Thursday. The WhatsApp messages revealed an “intimacy” between Johnson and Brownlow, said Sir Alistair Graham, a former chair of the committee on standards in public life. He told the Guardian: “It shows he was well aware of what was going on in Downing Street. It raises the question about how Johnson wouldn’t have known he was providing real cash for the refurbishment. “It would certainly provide an incentive for his idea, getting close to the prime minister in order to get it off the ground, by helping him with his refurbishment. It adds to the unsavoury nature of the whole exercise.” No 10 denied there was anything untoward about Brownlow’s meeting with Dowden and stressed the peer had acted with integrity since first being approached to chair the Downing Street trust. A spokesperson said it was normal for ministers to meet stakeholders and hear proposals put to them, adding: “In line with normal practice this idea was referred to the relevant department, considered and ultimately not taken forward by the government.” Brownlow was contacted for comment. 29 November 2020, 12.59pmBoris Johnson: Hi DavidI am afraid parts of our flat are still a bit of a tip and am keen to allow Lulu Lytle to get on with it. Can I possibly ask her to get in touch with you for approvals ?Many thanks and all bestBorisPs am on the great exhibition plan Will revert. 29 November 2020, 3.44pmDavid Brownlow: Afternoon Prime Minister, I hope you’re both wellSorry for the delay I was out for a walk and didn’t have my ‘work’ phone with me.Of course, get Lulu to call me and we’ll get it sorted ASAP !Thanks for thinking about GE2Best wishes David 29 November 2020, 4.10pmDavid Brownlow: I should have said, as the Trust isn’t set up yet (will be in January) approval is a doddle as it’s only me and I know where the £ will come from, so as soon as Lulu calls we can crack on – David",News/Politics,Boris Johnson accused of corruption after ‘great exhibition’ text emerges,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/06/boris-johnson-accused-corruption-great-exhibition-text-flat-refurb
1/7/2022,"A new academic study has claimed that playing fantasy football can lead to a decline in mental health, that worsens significantly the more time you spend playing. In what is claimed to be the first of its kind, research conducted by Nottingham Trent University, and published in the journal Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies, looked at the mental health and wellbeing of fantasy players, an popular activity with more than seven million active players on the Premier League’s fantasy game alone.  A survey was taken by 1,995 individuals that recorded their engagement with the game – time spent playing, researching and thinking about fantasy football – and the effect it had on their mood, social adjustment and habits. Whereas about a quarter of respondents (24.6%) said playing caused them to experience at least a mild low mood, that number almost doubled among heavy users. A mild low mood or greater was reported by 44% of those who spent more than 45 minutes playing, more than 60 minutes researching and more than 120 minutes thinking about fantasy football a day. Of those surveyed 20.8% spent more than 45 minutes a day playing; 34% of heavy users said the game caused them at least mild anxiety (compared with 20% of all players) and 37% said it disrupted their lives, causing what the researchers called “functional impairment”. This was considerably more than double the 14% of all players who acknowledged such an effect. Fantasy football is popular across the world, with the survey’s respondents coming from 96 countries. As well as a broad number of games and leagues to choose from there is a massive ecosystem of supporting content that offers advice on how to play, from podcasts to websites and countless social media accounts. Researchers found that the involvement of social media added a “myriad of complex cognitive and social psychological processes that may negatively impact one’s mental health”. They also drew a comparison with video games, observing that in fantasy football there is a relative lack of control over outcomes – with points scored dictated by what occurs on a real-life pitch – something which has been identified as a risk factor in mental health. The average age of those who contributed to the study was 33 and almost 96% of respondents were male. “Fantasy football is unwinnable for the vast majority that play and it is possible that the more a person is invested the more negatively impacted they will be when they ‘lose’,” said Dr Luke Wilkins, the lead researcher in the study and an expert in sport and exercise psychology in Nottingham Trent University’s School of Science and Technology. “Our study highlights the general positives that the game can bring, but also warns of the potential negatives, and provides justification for the idea that more should be done to monitor the amount of time being dedicated to playing fantasy football.” Researchers are carrying out further work focusing on a group of high-engaged fantasy football players and tracking the mental health of players over the course of a Premier League season.",Sport/Sport,"Fantasy football can lead to mental health decline, study claims",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/06/fantasy-football-can-lead-to-mental-health-decline-study-claims

Sincerely yours, David From the prime minister to Brownlow, 29 November 2020 Hi David, You seem to have misunderstood your role. The whole point of you is that you do get taken for a ride and in exchange you get a new honour every now and again. You’re already a lord; what more do you want? So can we just get on with it? Carrie has already given Lulu Lytle her instructions and I just need to confirm the money is in place. Not mine, obviously, because I’m struggling to get by on £160,000 a year these days and the alimony payments on the kids are crippling. Besides, I’ve never really paid for anything and I’m not intending to start now I’m prime minister.
