1/17/2022,"A campaign group is challenging what it says is an information blackout imposed by the Environment Agency on its investigation into suspected illegal sewage dumping in England. The inquiry began after water companies admitted to the agency it may have been illegally discharging raw sewage from treatment works into rivers and streams.  The investigation involves more than 2,000 water treatment works, nearly a third of the total in England, and is likely to involve most, if not all, water companies. Fish Legal has asked the agency in an environmental information request for details of the treatment works being investigated, the time period the inquiry is examining and whether the inquiry would mean that the agency’s already delayed responses to pollution incidents would be delayed further. But the agency has refused to release any details on the grounds that there would be adverse harm to its investigation, despite strong public interest in the case. Penny Gane, the head of legal practice at Fish Legal, said it was trying to ensure a veil of secrecy was not kept over the operation and the impact of storm overflows by water companies. Historically, EA investigations have taken years. Southern Water was fined £90m last year for dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into protected seas, after a seven-year investigation by the agency. Gane said imposing a blackout on information relating to sewage discharges would hamper campaign groups and the public, who had brought to light the systemic abuse of the permit conditions under which sewage treatment works have to operate in the first place. “The concern is that nothing is going to be shared now for years and people who have been looking at the harms caused by sewage discharges will be unable to continue their work because the agency is using a blanket application of the ‘course of justice’ exemptions under the environmental information regulations, which will continue for years,” Gane said. In its response to Fish Legal, the agency said it could not disclose the information because it would have an adverse effect on their ability to investigate under exemption 12(5)(b). The agency acknowledged “the factor of public interest” was strong and said it would seek to provide an update when appropriate that did not undermine the confidentiality of the investigatory process. Fish Legal is challenging the refusal to release information and has requested the agency review their decision. MPs on the environmental audit committee said in a report on Thursday they were alarmed at the extent of sewage discharges, large spills and misreporting by water companies. They also cited evidence from Prof Peter Hammond, who revealed that the scale of illegal sewage dumping from treatment plants could be far greater than the amount reported to the agency by water companies. Hammond’s information came from requests under the environmental information regulations to the EA and water firms. “It is just this kind of information which we fear will now not be released,” Gane said. The Environment Agency declined to comment.",News/Environment,Legal group challenges information blackout on sewage discharges in England,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/17/fish-legal-information-blackout-sewage-discharges-england-environment-agency-investigation
1/17/2022,"The UK armed forces are to be put in charge of stopping people from travelling across the Channel in small boats as Boris Johnson seeks to sidestep the partygate scandal and remain as prime minister. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has been in talks about the involvement of the military for weeks, Whitehall sources said, as the numbers travelling from France have continued through the winter.  Reports have claimed that plans are also being drawn up to send people to countries such as Ghana and Rwanda for processing and resettlement. It follows reports over the weekend that No 10 has launched “Operation Red Meat” amid growing public anger over Downing Street parties. The prime minister will give the Royal Navy “primacy” over all government vessels in the Channel this month in one of a series of populist policies as calls grow for him to step down over Downing Street lockdown parties. It comes as Boris Johnson awaits the senior civil servant Sue Gray’s report on the parties, which is expected to focus on the faults of senior civil servants in Downing Street. The report is not expected to call for a criminal inquiry into Johnson, but Gray could still suggest that Christopher Geidt could investigate the prime minister for breaching the ministerial code. The army and the navy would in theory be able to deploy naval ships, boats and sophisticated surveillance technology to bolster Border Force. Plans include asking the navy to intervene if Border Force officers go on strike or refuse to deploy “pushback” tactics, where boats or jet skis block and redirect migrants’ boats back towards France. Record numbers of migrants are crossing the Channel in small boats, but the controversial tactic has so far not been used. The Guardian disclosed in November that government lawyers have advised that the odds of successfully defending a challenge in the courts against the lawfulness of plans to send vessels carrying people back to France is “less than 30%”. The Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents some border and immigration officials, has said it “totally opposes” the policy and has threatened strike action. It has also joined with the Care4Calais charity to seek a judicial review of the tactic, which it claims is illegal. A government source confirmed that the plans have been discussed and brought forward, adding it would be up to the Ministry of Defence to determine operational deployments. “The home secretary called for the military to defend UK territorial waters against illegal migration in August 2020, when the first request for support went into the MoD,” said a Whitehall source. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, said on Monday that bringing in the military would be a good idea. “It is a good idea that there is a single command and control, and that includes not just naval vessels but all other vessels including Border Force, so that you actually have a coordinated operation in terms of the small boats. “A really important idea is the legislation that Priti Patel has put through parliament to allow us to have a much better way of dealing with illegal migration because there are legal routes for migration, you know, I’m the son of immigrants.” He said the government wanted to “go after the illegal smugglers who are putting these people’s lives at risk”. But when told those were not the ones on the boats, he added: “Well, they’re the ones we want.” Reports have claimed that the military could also transport migrants to offshore processing centres, as proposed in the government’s nationality and borders bill, or even operate deportation flights of foreign criminals. The moves follow a record 28,300 migrants crossing the Channel to the UK last year, more than three times the 8,400 in 2020. There is no sign of a decline this year – 581 have already crossed the Channel this month, already more than double the total for January last year.",News/World news,Military to be used to stem Channel crossings as Johnson seeks to stay PM,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/military-to-be-used-to-stem-channel-crossings-as-johnson-seeks-to-stay-pm
1/17/2022,"Janice Hallett topped charts last year with her debut, The Appeal, a thriller about a murder in the sleepy town of Lower Lockwood told entirely in a mix of texts, emails and documents. Hallett’s second novel, The Twyford Code, is innovative in a different way: it is a transcription of 200 audio files that have been found on the iPhone 4 of missing ex-convict Steven Smith. Steven, the reader discovers, has recently been released after more than a decade in prison. Rejected by the son who never knew him, lonely and at a loose end, he becomes increasingly obsessed with how his former teacher Miss Iles vanished while on a class field trip 40 years earlier and decides to investigate. The audio files are his record of ​the​ inquiry, as he looks up the former friends who were with him on that long-ago ​outing​ to the coast and digs into Miss Iles’s own obsessions. She believed that Edith Twyford, a “twee and much-maligned children’s author” who is a shameless (and brilliant) pastiche of Enid Blyton, put coded secrets in her books during the second world war, and was investigating this when she disappeared. Steven becomes equally fixated, working with a helpful librarian, Lucy, to decipher a code in Twyford’s books, which he comes to believe will lead to hidden treasure.  Twyford is despised by modern readers for her “nasty, sadistic, moral little tales full of pompous superiority at best and blatant racism at worst”, and Hallett has a great deal of fun with the snippets of her stories she provides: “Never mind adventure, young Rose. There’s bread to bake, jam to make, the cow to milk, beds to strip and the kitchen garden to rake. You will be too busy to play with your brothers and shouldn’t be so selfish as to think otherwise. Girl children are to follow instructions.” She has even more fun with the codes that Steven – and the reader – set out to crack. And watching Steven, an ex-con, describe what is basically the plot of the Famous Five is a genuine joy: “The kids have I think technically stolen, although it says borrowed, a rowing boat from a fisherman and are camping on an island off the coast of their aunt’s property” – so far, so Kirrin Island. But then, as Steven so aptly puts it: “Turns out some grunts in the local firm are using this island to stash their contra.” The Twyford Code is a tour de force – a genuinely complex puzzle with real clues to be solved, all told in the unreliable voice of a protagonist with a heartbreaking history of his own. “I’m just an old man in an old car talking into his son’s old phone,” says Steven, who has learned to read while incarcerated, discovering that the prison librarian’s trolley is “stacked with treasure waiting to be found”. The transcription tool used on the audio files sometimes gets it wrong, and helpfully blanks out any swear words, so “must have” becomes “mustard”, Bournemouth becomes “bore moth”, and events become “pretty f[EXPLICIT] lairy”. This is pretty f[EXPLICIT] brilliant itself – a mind-bending, heartwarming mystery that is not to be missed.  The Twyford Code by Janice Hallett is published by Profile (£14.99).

1/17/2022,"The thing about completing a successful Hail Mary pass is that it involves throwing an actual Hail Mary. Down six points with 14 seconds left on the clock in his team’s wildcard playoff against the San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott took the ball and ran instead of heaving it into the endzone. It was a disastrous decision that ensured the once-mighty Cowboys suffered yet another early postseason exit. What a way to end the game! #SuperWildCard pic.twitter.com/esKKpbkrQn  The already infamous final play started on the San Francisco 41-yard line. On 2nd and 1, Prescott rushed for 17 yards before he was taken down by the San Francisco 49ers’ defense. In theory, the QB had just enough time to spike the ball and then attempt a game-winning touchdown on fourth down. Instead, after getting up, Prescott collided with the umpire as the official attempted to place the ball down, a crucial error that allowed the clock to run down. The 49ers held on for a 23-17 victory. “That was the best option … It’s the right decision,” Dallas head coach Mike McCarthy said after the game, regarding the final play of the game (offensive coordinator Kellen Moore called Prescott’s run play with McCarthy giving it the OK). McCarthy postgame analysis will be disputed by many, particularly Cowboys fans. It was a fitting end to a game in which the Cowboys were dinged for a whopping 14 penalties. In a game they eventually lost by six points, the Cowboys’ playoff death was primarily due to a series of self-inflicted wounds – some would say hiring a coach as unimpressive as McCarthy in the first place was the first one – with Prescott’s inexplicable run merely the last of them. The most painful thing about that Cowboys’ loss is that they had a chance to win the game after at one point trailing the Niners 23-7. Once upon a time, back when the Cowboys were firmly America’s Team and synonymous with football, they would have pulled it off. This is a franchise that has made it to the Super Bowl eight times, tied for the second-most out of all NFL franchises. Between 1992 and 1995, they won three championships and established themselves as the team of the decade. They were more than dominant, they were inevitable. That changed. The Cowboys haven’t won a title since the 1995 season. In their last 11 playoff appearances, they have failed to even make the conference championship game, the longest such drought since the AFC and NFC were established in 1970. With Sunday’s loss, they have now gone out in their first game of the postseason seven times in those 11 opportunities. There is, however, one place where the Cowboys still reign supreme. At $5.7bn, the Cowboys are ranked by Forbes as the most valuable sports franchise in the world. That’s not bad for a team that Jerry Jones purchased for $150m back in 1989. That puts them above storied teams like the New York Yankees, Real Madrid and the Los Angeles Lakers. Of course, there’s a major difference between those teams and the Cowboys: the others have won titles this century. The Cowboys, in contrast, keep taking in money without producing any tangible results. Actually, scratch that, maybe in a very real way, they still are America’s Team. Josh Allen, quarterback, Buffalo Bills. On Saturday, Allen rushed for 66 yards, went 21-for-25 passing and threw for 308 yards, plus five touchdowns, in a “stop, stop, they’re already dead” offensive performance, almost single-handedly ensuring that the New England Patriots will retool their defense in the offseason. Allen, who was thrillingly uneven during his first few seasons in the league, now looks more and more like one of the game’s premier quarterbacks and someone that none of the remaining playoff teams will be eager to face. JOE BURR-WOW. #RuleTheJungle#SuperWildCard @JoeyB📺: #LVvsCIN on NBC📱: NFL app pic.twitter.com/1U4Gq33J61 Joe Burrow’s second touchdown throw of the Cincinnati Bengals’ 26-19 win over the Las Vegas Raiders was impressive. But it probably should not have counted. Before Tyler Boyd made the catch, an official accidentally blew the whistle, which caused several Raiders defenders to assume that the play had been called dead. Whether Boyd would have made the catch anyway is debatable, but the NFL rules indicate that the play should not have stood. On Sunday, word came out that head referee Jerome Boger’s officiating crew is not expected to return this postseason. That would be the best for everybody involved. 2-for-47. On Sunday, the Philadelphia Eagles were held scoreless in the first half of a playoff game for just the second time in 47 chances. The Buccaneers eventually defeated the Eagles 31-15. BONUS STAT OF THE WEEK: Rob Gronkowski’s touchdown reception on Sunday was the 107th of his career. Of those 107 touchdowns, 105 of them were thrown by the same person: Tom Brady. “I’d say that would be accurate” – New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick after he was asked if he plans to return next season after his team’s humiliating 47-17 loss to the Buffalo Bills. That quote is notable because Belichick, who turns 70 in a few months, has previously dismissed the idea of coaching into his eighth decade. Has something changed? Well, let’s talk about the elephant in the room: Tom Brady. The quarterback left the Patriots for the Buccaneers in 2020 and duly won a Super Bowl in his first season in Tampa, while New England missed the playoffs. One of the longest ongoing arguments in US sports – up there with LeBron v Jordan in longevity/annoyingness – has been whether Belichick or Brady was more responsible for the Patriots dynasty … and the immediate returns were a solid mark in Brady’s favor. Belichick would never admit it publicly, but you have to believe he’s desperate to win at least one ring as head coach without Brady’s help. -- The Las Vegas Raiders’ season began in disarray when head coach Jon Gruden resigned on 11 October after a number of highly-offensive emails were discovered during an NFL investigation. Then, the team cut Henry Ruggs III after the wide receiver was involved in a fatal car crash. In that void, assistant head coach Rich Bisaccia helped guide the team to a 10-7 regular season and a competitive postseason loss. Following their elimination, quarterback Derek Carr and defensive end Maxx Crosby took the case for retaining Bisaccia. “I think we can all think he’s the right guy,” Carr said after their loss on Saturday. Bisaccia has never been a full-time head coach, he came into the league as a special teams coordinator for the Buccaneers in 2002 and has stayed employed in the NFL in a variety of roles since. The man has paid his dues, in other words. The Raiders should explore all their options before coming to a decision, but Bisaccia has made a strong case that the most logical move would be to lift that “interim” tag from his job title. -- Ben Roethlisberger’s final game as a Steeler went as expected with the Kansas City Chiefs recording a crushing 42-21 win over Pittsburgh on Sunday evening. The Chiefs’ offense is clicking at the right time and was too much even for a defense boasting TJ Watt and Cam Heyward. And the days when Roethlisberger could match a quarterback of Patrick Mahomes’ quality are long gone. -- When the San Francisco 49ers picked Trey Lance in last year’s draft, the assumption was that they would see what they could get from starting quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo on the trade market. Instead, the 49ers made the decision to keep both men, keeping their veteran starter while slowly developing Lance until they thought he was ready. While Garoppolo wasn’t perfect on Sunday, as his brutal late-game interception proved, being patient could end up paying dividends. Lance has a higher ceiling than Garoppolo, whose propensity for making poor throws has made him a lightning rod for criticism. But San Francisco think they have a good chance of winning a championship right now and believe that Garoppolo – who has already led the team to an unexpected Super Bowl appearance – gives them a better chance in the playoffs than a talented, but completely untested rookie. Can Garoppolo mimic the story of Nick Foles, the unassuming journeyman who was supposed to be Carson Wentz’s backup in Philadelphia, but ended up being the MVP of Super Bowl LII? Stay tuned. -- Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts struggled in his playoff debut, going 22-for-40 while throwing two interceptions. He didn’t record a touchdown pass until late in the fourth quarter when the game was essentially decided. Still, the 2020 second-round draft pick had a solid first year as a starter, replacing the not-entirely-dearly departed Carson Wentz, even being selected as a Pro Bowl alternate. After the game, Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni gave Hurts what sounded like a genuine vote of confidence. “I know we’re all judged on the last game that we played,” he said, “I fully get that, but I felt like Jalen grew throughout the year. And he got better as a passer, he got better reading the defense, getting the ball to the right place.” It sounds like the Eagles are sticking with their young quarterback for the time being.
