12/28/2021,"Reports circulating through the conservative blogosphere and social media accounts that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is buying a $25 million Jupiter Island mansion are, well, fake news. The mansion in question is at 429 S. Beach Road on the exclusive area that is home to such celebrities as golfer Tiger Woods, singer Celine Dion and country music star Alan Jackson. ""There is zero association between the seller of the home, the buyer of the home and Nancy Pelosi,"" said Rob Thomson, owner of Waterfront Properties.

Beach Road, that just went under contract for $19,995,000 also is not being purchased by Pelosi, Thomson said. That buyer is an existing Jupiter Island resident, said Thomson, who represented the seller. He said he has met the buyer and the buyer is not Pelosi, either. Both sales close at the end of the month, he added. More: Fact check: No, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn't worth $196 million ""Nancy Pelosi has no connection to either property,"" Thomson said. The terms ""Pelosi Florida mansion,"" ""nancy pelosi Florida mansion"" and ""jupiter island"" were trending on Google search in Florida late Tuesday and much of Wednesday. USA Today reviewed Pelosi financial reports earlier this year and determined she has a net worth of about $106 million. Financial disclosures show that Pelosi and her husband, Paul Pelosi, who owns and operates a San Francisco-based investment firm, have millions of dollars in real estate investments, business partnerships and stock holdings. She owns a Napa, California home and vineyard worth between $5 million and $25 million and generated between $100,001 and $1 million in income from grape sales, according to a 2019 financial report. The couple also owns several commercial properties that generate rental income in that same range and hold investments in undeveloped real estate. While assets listed on the form total between $57 million and $271 million, liabilities range from $20 million to $97 million. Liabilities include multimillion-dollar mortgages on several properties and equity credit lines. Pelosi has been in Congress since 1987 when members were paid $89,500. Today, as speaker, Pelosi earns $223,500.

12/28/2021,"Two panthers had a hot date in front of a trail camera, resulting in “what are likely the first ever images of Florida panthers mating,” according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute. Photos of the encounter were shared Dec. 21 on Facebook, showing the female may have played hard to get — at least at first. The series starts with the two large cats following each other, then the female crouches in the grass and the mating process begins. Biologist didn’t say how long it lasted, but the coupling concludes with the female appearing to growl angrily. “These remote trail camera photos were taken on Babcock Ranch Preserve, Charlotte County, on Aug 24th,” the institute wrote. “Breeding success north of the Caloosahatchee River is critical to the long-term viability of the Florida panther population, so we are hopeful that this mating event resulted in a litter of kittens that would have been born around Nov 22.” If the female gave birth, her kittens will likely emerge from the den in January, officials said. Florida panthers weigh as much as 160 pounds and reach just over 7 feet “from nose to tip of the tail,” the state says. They are also endangered: It’s believed no more than 230 adults remain in Florida, mostly in the southwestern part of the state, experts say. Billy Gunnels of Florida Gulf Coast University says having such a small population largely in one area means Florida’s panthers could be largely wiped out by a catastrophe, according to station WBBH. “If you have one terrible terrible event ... maybe it’s a terrible hurricane, maybe it’s a disease that goes through the population … the animal disappears. They’re gone, they become extinct,” Gunnels told the station. The “over the top” mating photos were also shared by the South Florida Wildlands Association, which noted a “disturbing” aspect to the story. Florida’s panthers “need vast swaths of roadless habitat” to survive, and that is rapidly disappearing, the association says. “The Babcock Preserve where these photos were taken is adjacent to the ‘new town’ of Babcock Ranch. ... And those 17,000 acres of new development are now booming,” the association wrote. “Many other properties nearby are also ripe for development (development begets development), as are important habitats in private ownership throughout Central Florida.” ‘Wrestling match’ involving rabid bobcat and Virginia man has captivated social media Bobcat plays with its live food ‘just like a house cat’ in Rhode Island video Trail camera captures startling predator sailing through air in Colorado.

12/28/2021,"Executives at ABC's ""The View"" are still seeking a conservative cohost after Meghan McCain's exit. The network wants a conservative who will tussle with the ladies but not be too confrontational. ""They are really looking for a unicorn,"" a former ""View"" staffer told Politico. Since the departure of Meghan McCain from ABC's ""The View"" earlier this year, the oft-raucous panel has lacked a permanent Republican panelist, and several of the cohosts are pushing the network to nix the rotation of guest hosts and select a conservative replacement, according to Politico. The past few months have featured guest hosting stints by a range of conservative women including former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former Hewlett-Packard chief executive officer Carly Fiorina, former Fox News journalist Gretchen Carlson, political commentator S.E. Cupp, former White House Director of Strategic Communications Alyssa Farah, and former State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus. In August, executive producer Brian Teta told The Wrap that he was ""taking a little time"" to find the long-running daytime show's next host. However, months after McCain's exit, there has been no resolution on selecting a permanent panelist, and cohosts Joy Behar, Whoopi Goldberg, and Sunny Hostin have reportedly made it known that the continued guest hosting has disrupted the energy of the show. Hostin, a former federal prosecutor, told New York Magazine in November that the new host having a divergent political view is necessary for the show. ""Right now, we still do need a really conservative voice,"" she said at the time. ""I also believe it's really important to not have someone on the panel who spreads misinformation, who adheres to the big lies, who is an anti-vaxxer, because I think that's dangerous."" A spokesperson for ""The View"" told Politico that the show will resume holding auditions for potential hosts in the new year, and will also invite some of the previous guest hosts back for another stint. Farah will once again serve as a panelist on the program next month. The network will also bring in former New York Times journalist Bari Weiss and former ""View"" cohost Lisa Ling — individuals who don't particularly fall under a ""Republican"" moniker — while the network continues to gauge viewer reaction to the array of guest hosts. According to sources who spoke with Politico, network executives have had a difficult time finding a suitable replacement, as they are not actively considering a Republican who continues to challenge the 2020 presidential election results or has shown support for the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. The executives are reportedly not screening candidates who have publicly dabbled in conspiracy theories, but would like to hire someone who has ""credibility with mainstream Republicans,"" according to Politico. ""The problem is that they bring people on under the mantle that this woman is a conservative, when they're 'Never Trump,' so they don't represent the country,"" a guest host told the news outlet. Executives are also reportedly seeking a conservative that isn't too congenial with the other cohosts, as the show's research reveals that audience members want to see quarrels. According to Politico, the aforementioned request has damaged the chances of Ana Navarro-Cárdenas, a conservative who has rejected former President Donald Trump and gets along well with the other ladies — but is not seen as a ""traditional"" Republican by producers. ""They are really looking for a unicorn,"" a former show staffer told Politico. ""They want someone who is going to fight — but not too hard, because they don't want it to be ugly and bickering."" The high-profile exits of past conservative hosts including Elizabeth Hasselbeck, Nicole Wallace, Abby Huntsman, and McCain have also contributed to a ""perception"" that any permanent Republican panelist will be ""on borrowed time,"" according to Politico. Sources informed Politico that ""The View"" was reportedly interested in bringing on libertarian and Fox News personality Kat Timpf, but said that she declined an offer because the program has a reputation for not being friendly to conservative voices. The program is still on the hunt for their newest member, though. ""Our plans are on track as we continue to look for the right person to join our panel of smart, dynamic women,"" a ""View"" spokesperson told Politico. ""We look forward to welcoming guest co-hosts for return appearances and introducing new names into the mix in the new year.""

12/28/2021,"Minimum wage workers in Illinois will see a boost in their hourly pay to $12 per hour starting Jan. 1, while tenants in affordable housing units will be allowed to keep pets. Those are just some of the more than 300 new laws that take effect in the new year. The minimum wage increase is actually the result of a 2019 law that phases in a state minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. This year, it will increase by $1 to $12 an hour. The law allowing public housing tenants to keep pets is the result of Senate Bill 154, by Sen. Linda Holmes, D-Aurora, and Rep. Stephanie Kifowit, D-Oswego. It provides that tenants of multifamily housing units that are acquired, built or renovated with money from the Illinois Affordable Housing Trust Fund may keep up to two cats or one dog weighing less than 50 pounds. It applies to residents of housing units that are designated as affordable housing for low- and very-low-income families. The bill passed both chambers in its final form on May 30 and Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed it into law Aug. 6. Other new laws include: SB58 raises the private vehicle tax, which is a sales tax paid on the purchase of vehicles, by $75 for each model year where the purchase price is less than $15,000 and by $100 for vehicles priced above that amount. However, the registration fee for trailers weighing less than 3,000 pounds will drop to $36 instead of $118. HB226, establishing the Higher Education Fair Admissions Act, prohibits public colleges and universities from requiring applicants to submit SAT, ACT or other standardized test scores as part of the admissions process, although prospective students may choose to submit them if they wish. SB1682 requires pharmacies to post a notice informing consumers that they may request current pharmacy retail prices at the point of sale. HB562 enacts several changes to the Firearm Owner Identification card law. Among other things, it provides for a streamlined renewal process for FOID cards and Concealed Carry Licenses for people who voluntarily submit fingerprint records. It also allows the Illinois State Police to issue a combined FOID card and Concealed Carry License to qualified applicants, and it establishes a new Violent Crime Intelligence Task Force to take enforcement action against people with revoked FOID cards. HB576 and SB1577 allow students in Illinois up to five excused absences to attend to their mental or behavioral health without providing a medical note. Those students will be given an opportunity to make up any work they missed during the first absence and, after using a second mental health day, may be referred to the appropriate school support personnel. HB605 requires state agencies and institutions to purchase Illinois and American flags that are made in the United States. SB817 prohibits discrimination in schools against individuals on the grounds of wearing natural or ethnic hairstyles, which include dreadlocks, braids, twists and afros. SB119 prohibits public health authorities from regulating or shutting down lemonade stands or similar operations that are operated by children under the age of 16. Known as “Hayli’s Law,” it was inspired by 12-year-old Hayli Martinez, whose lemonade stand in Kankakee was shut down by local officials. HB3922 recognizes June 19, or “Juneteenth,” as an official state holiday that commemorates the end of slavery in the United States. In June, President Joe Biden also signed a bill designating Juneteenth as a federal holiday.

12/28/2021,"A driver accused in a crash that killed a gate attendant at an Atlanta-area retirement community is behind bars, thanks to a “great deal of courage” from the man’s father, police said. David Glosson, 41, was charged with vehicular homicide and other charges after plowing into the gate attendant’s building on Dec. 27 at the entrance to Sun City Peachtree in Griffin, according to the Spalding County Sheriff’s Office. Authorities said 60-year-old Ebenezer Sowunmi was at his post when Glosson’s car barreled into the building just before 3 a.m. Sowunmi was hit and died at the scene, according to police. Glosson left the crash on foot and headed to his father’s house in the Sun City community. When his father learned what happened, he took Glosson to the crash scene and dialed 911, making sure his son stayed until officers arrived, police said. “It took a great deal of courage to do what Glosson’s father did by taking his son back to the scene and keeping him there until we arrived,” Spalding County Sheriff Darrell Dix said in a statement. “He did the right thing and made sure his son was held responsible for his actions.” Dix also expressed sadness for the attendant’s family, calling his death “a horrible loss especially this time of the year.” Police arrested Glosson on charges of vehicular homicide, DUI and failure to maintain lane, according to a news release. He was booked into the Spalding County jail where he remained held without bond as of Dec. 27, online records show. The crash remains under investigation. Griffin is about 45 miles south of Atlanta.
