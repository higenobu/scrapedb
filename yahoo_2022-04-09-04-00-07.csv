4/9/2022,"Christian “Toby” Obumseli was a handsome Texan who came to Miami to work in cryptocurrency. His girlfriend was Courtney Clenney, of Michigan, a social media influencer who has millions of followers on Instagram and OnlyFans. On Sunday, Clenney fatally stabbed Obumseli, 27, inside their luxury high-rise Edgewater apartment in what Miami police say was a domestic dispute. But five days after the killing, police and prosecutors have not yet decided whether to charge Clenney, 25, while they try to sort out whether she was acting in self-defense. Obumseli’s supporters have taken to social media to call for an arrest in the case and his relatives plan to hold a press conference Friday afternoon outside the State Attorney’s Office. The celebrity gossip website TMZ.com on Friday also posted a video of a blood-stained, handcuffed Clenney talking to Miami police officers — shaky images apparently taken from an adjacent building. “His murder leaves many unanswered questions and creates a void that can never be fixed or filled. Not even with time,” his brother wrote on a GoFundMe page. Clenney is known as Courtney Tailor on her social-media platforms, where she boasts over two million followers. She and Obumseli had been dating less than two years. Her defense attorney said Clenney was a victim of domestic violence and acted only out of fear for her life. “As Courtney struggles with the pain of being a survivor of domestic violence and the aftermath of the events that evening, we ask that the community and Christian’s family allow the police and the state to conduct their independent investigation of the events,” Frank Prieto said. “This is a tragedy for all involved but it was not criminal conduct; Courtney was defending herself and the investigation will reveal exactly that.” The stabbing happened at the El Paraiso, 650 NE 32nd St., where the two had lived. Clenney frantically called 911 in a panic, and Obumseli was rushed to the hospital, where he died of a single stab wound to the front of his chest. “The preliminary investigation determined that both Mr. Obumseli and the female had been involved in a physical altercation,” Miami police said in a statement. She was later hospitalized for a psychiatric evaluation. Friends of the couple and witnesses gave WPLG Channel 10 various accounts of what appeared to be a stormy relationship. A neighbor told the station Obumseli swung at her about a week ago. The couple had apparently broken up last month, with Clenney’s mother visiting to help her daughter, who was afraid of leaving the apartment because Obumseli kept trying to find ways into the building and sleeping in common areas, multiple sources said. Then on Friday, April 1, Miami police were called to the apartment because of a domestic dispute. Miami police officers noticed bruises on Clenney’s arms and legs, law enforcement sources told the Miami Herald. No arrests were made at that time. The fatal stabbing happened two days later. After Sunday’s stabbing, Clenney claimed she stabbed Obumseli only after he attacked her, pushed her to the ground and grabbed her neck, law-enforcement sources tell the Herald. Under Florida’s Stand Your Ground law, prosecutors must thoroughly disprove a self-defense claim before filing charges or taking the case to a jury. The Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Family members were scheduled to meet with prosecutors at 3 p.m., before the press conference.",U.S./Miami Herald,Miami IG model fatally stabs boyfriend.

4/9/2022,"In a shocking twist, a gaggle of white men accused of conspiring to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in the weeks before the 2020 presidential election dodged convictions on Friday. After five days of deliberations, a Michigan jury acquitted Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta of several charges, including conspiracy, for what prosecutors said was a depraved scheme born out of anti-government anger at the Democratic leader’s COVID-19 restrictions. The jury, however, could not come to a consensus on the other two defendants and alleged ringleaders of the plot—Adam Fox and Barry Croft—and thus their cases ended in a mistrial. The partial verdict came after five days of deliberation, and marked perhaps the worst blow against federal prosecutors seeking to crack down on right-wing extremists in the aftermath of a uniquely violent and unhinged election season. It also came after the case was marred by misconduct allegations against some of the FBI agents involved, as well as a “double agent” informant the feds effectively disavowed. Since the jury was deadlocked on charges against Fox and Croft, a mistrial was declared, though the two remained in custody. The decisions came after the jury indicated twice they were deadlocked in the high-anticipated trial. “Best birthday gift ever” Caserta told the courtroom after the verdict was read, according to reporting from the Detroit News. He and Harris were released immediately. Outside the courthouse, U.S. Attorney Andrew Birge told reporters that while the verdict was “not the outcome we wanted,” prosecutors still planned to proceed with another case against Fox and Croft. “We thought the jury would convict beyond reasonable doubt based on the evidence... We believe in the jury system,” he added. Did This Accused Whitmer Kidnap Plotter Just Doom Himself? Prosecutors said the defendants, who included militia members and self-described patriots, spent months hatching the violent plan after Whitmer locked down the state in an effort to mitigate spread of the deadly virus. The plot allegedly included plans to kidnap the governor, detonate a bridge to prevent cops from rescuing her, and possibly leave her stranded on a boat in the middle of Lake Michigan. “In America, there’s a lot of things you can do. You can criticize the government publicly, absolutely,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Nils Kessler said during closing arguments on Friday. “If you don’t like the government’s policies, you can protest them. If you don’t like elected leaders, you can vote them out at the ballot box. “What you can’t do is kidnap them, kill them, or blow them up,” Kessler said. Defense attorneys for the four men argued throughout the month-long trial that their clients were coaxed by FBI informants into a plot they otherwise would never have become involved in. The attorneys noted that the informants received thousands of dollars over the course of their work. The feds actually agreed they had an informant problem. One of them, Stephen Robeson, was accused by prosecutors of being a “double agent” who had worked “against the interests of the government.” BuzzFeed News noted that Robeson pleaded guilty last year to a gun charge over a sniper rifle. Still, his secret recordings were critical pieces of evidence, and a second informant testified at the trial. Meanwhile, at least three FBI agents who had integral roles in the investigation were not called to the stand after a flurry of scandal. One was fired last year after being charged with domestic violence against his wife, allegedly tied to a dispute about an orgy. Defense lawyers did all they could to zero in on alleged overreach by sloppy feds. “When I look at what happened in this case, I am ashamed of the behavior of the leading law enforcement agency in the United States,” Josh Blanchard, who is representing Croft, told jurors. “The investigation was an embarrassment. There was no plan and there was no agreement.” Harris, a 24-year-old former Marine, also insisted to jurors that there was no organized plan to kidnap Whitmer—insisting on the stand that he joined the group to “drink beer, shoot guns, and talk about girls.” He also took the opportunity to bash his fellow defendants, describing Croft as a “stoner pirate” who was “kind of a whack nut” to jurors. Will a ‘Double Agent’ Informant and FBI Mayhem Torpedo the Gretchen Whitmer Kidnapping Case? Prosecutors say Harris and Caserta were members of a self-styled militia called the Wolverine Watchmen, which, as The Daily Beast reported, put a scare into neighbors in rural Michigan prior to their arrests in fall 2020. Fox—whom prosecutors described as one of the plot’s ringleaders—and Croft were said to be affiliated with the “Three Percenter” far-right anti-government movement. The group name is a reference to the false notion that only a tiny fraction of residents of the 13 colonies fought in the American Revolution. Several current or former adherents to the bogus worldview were charged with conspiracy over the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. The only defendant to take the stand, Harris later admitted to building a failed explosive device with Croft and setting it off. “I was putting BBs and a little bit of gunpowder into this balloon, and we were going to blow up a stove,” Harris added. “We put it in a stove. We lit the fuse and we ran.” His testimony came after two of his alleged former co-conspirators testified against him after pleading guilty to the scheme. Both said that Harris was an active and willing participant in the plot. Prosecutors argued during the trial that the group took several steps to make their violent plan a reality, including tactical training, bomb building, and amassing an arsenal in the hopes of sparking a second civil war. By September 2020, however, the group began to unravel after an FBI informant introduced an undercover agent into the mix—who posed as an explosives expert. The men were arrested in October of that year after the FBI and Michigan State Police raided several homes. “Barry Croft drove across the country four times to plan this. Adam Fox came up (to Whitmer’s cottage) twice. It wasn’t just protected speech,” Kessler said on Friday, arguing the group also took steps to conceal their plans. “They weren’t going to protests. They were specifically keeping a low profile so that nobody would know what they were up to.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Got a tip?

4/9/2022,"As President Biden announced a new wave of severe financial sanctions against Russia this week for alleged war crimes against Ukraine, new details have emerged of how Russian soldiers have forcibly removed tens of thousands of Ukrainians from occupied areas and sent them to “filtration camps” for intense interrogation before shipping them off to various cities around Russia, according to multiple reports. The filtration camps, described as large plots of military tents with rows of men in uniforms, are where deported Ukrainians are photographed, fingerprinted, forced to turn over their cellphones, passwords and identity documents, and then questioned by officers for hours before being sent to Russia. A satellite image captured by the U.S.-based Maxar Technologies last week offered the first glimpse of one camp in the Russian-controlled village of Bezimenne, giving a peek into how Russians are processing Ukrainians and attempting to strip them of their identities. Ukrainian officials say more than 40,000 people have been forced into Russia against their will since last month. Ukrainians share 'degrading' experiences in the camps Many Ukrainians have shared with the Guardian harrowing accounts of being taken from their homes and dropped off in a foreign Russian community. “On March 15, Russian troops stormed into our bomb shelter and ordered all the women and children to get out. It was not a choice,” one woman, who requested anonymity for fear of her safety, told the British-based paper. “People need to know the truth, that Ukrainians are being moved to Russia, the country that is occupying us. “They went through my phone; they asked if I knew anything about the Ukrainian army, if I had friends in the military,” she added. “They also asked me what I thought about Ukraine, about [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and about the conflict. It was very degrading.” This claim backs up a recent Telegram post from the Mariupol City Council stating that Russian soldiers have kidnapped Ukrainian residents from the besieged port city of Mariupol, according to the English translation of the post. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, has denied these accusations, calling the reports “lies.” He claimed that an excess of 420,000 Ukrainians have voluntarily evacuated into Russia from dangerous conditions in Ukraine. Ukrainians who have been forced from their homes, however, contradict this assertion. They say Russian forces have transported Ukrainians through Russian-controlled eastern Ukraine in groups of 200 to 300. U.S. response to filtration camps Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, suggested on Tuesday at a U.N. Security Council briefing that there are similarities between present-day Russian filtration camps and Nazi Germany concentration camps nearly a century prior. “Reports indicate that Russian Federal Security agents are confiscating passports and IDs, taking away cellphones, and separating families from one another,” she said. “I do not need to spell out what these so-called filtration camps are reminiscent of. It’s chilling, and we cannot look away.” The scale and force of Russia’s deportations and widespread assaults on civilians remain unclear — but their impact has reverberated around the world. “We have all seen the gruesome photos,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “Lifeless bodies lying in the streets, apparently summarily executed, their hands tied behind their backs.” She called the reports of the abduction of children, mayors, doctors, religious leaders and journalists deeply troubling. History of filtration camps This is not the first time Russia has been accused of using filtration camps. The term originated in Europe after the end of World War II, in the mid- to late 1940s, according to Nick Baron, a professor of history at the University of Nottingham in the U.K. After millions of Soviet citizens gained their freedom from Nazi control, many who were living outside the Soviet Union sought to return but were subjected to holding stations and camps for screening before readmission. Fifty years later, during the first Chechen war in the mid-1990s and the second Chechen war in the early 2000s, as the small European nation vied for its independence, Russian forces once again used these camps for mass internment, according to NPR. The Guardian reported at the time several accounts of escapees detailing the horror inside these filtration camps. One Chechen man recalled men and women being raped by Russian guards, inmates being beaten daily with iron bars and others forced to use their close quarters as an open toilet. Another Chechen survivor said Russian forces were using the filtration camps for “extermination,” citing various accounts describing suffocation, electric shocks to genitalia, faked executions and exposure to frigid temperatures. Russians sought ransom from Chechens, and those who could not pay were tortured, most of them allegedly dying during the ordeal. Human Rights Watch, an international human rights organization, detailed the brutal abuse and violence in these camps in a February 2020 report. Thomas de Waal, a reporter who covered the war in the 1990s, told NPR last month that he sees similarities between the reports surfacing today and Russia’s actions then. “There are some pretty disturbing parallels,” de Waal told the public radio network. “The use of heavy artillery, the indiscriminate attacking of an urban center. They bring back some pretty terrible memories for those of us who covered the Chechnya war of the 1990s.” Two decades ago, Russia won a victory against Chechnya after those two wars. Global impact of filtration camps Offering some hope, according to the United Nations, the unlawful deportation, transfer or confinement of others constitutes a war crime. But the scope of any potential punishment remains unclear. The international human rights group Amnesty International listed details in its latest press release of “extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings,” as an attempt to record alleged Russian war crimes demonstrating the brutality of Russian forces. “Testimonies show that unarmed civilians in Ukraine are being killed in their homes and streets in acts of unspeakable cruelty and shocking brutality,” Agnès Callamard, the group's secretary-general, said in the release. “The intentional killing of civilians is a human rights violation and a war crime. These deaths must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible must be prosecuted, including up the chain of command.” Laura Mills, a researcher with the organization, hopes the stories it has personally verified help lead to justice for those involved. “These are apparent war crimes,” Mills told Yahoo News. “They should be investigated and prosecuted as such.” Ukrainian officials are hoping resources and increased Russian penalties will help them outlast their larger foe. Biden’s most recent sanctions include banning new investment in Russia, imposing the most severe financial sanctions on Russia’s largest bank and government officials and their family members, who include two of Putin’s daughters. “We’re going to stifle Russia’s ability to grow for years to come,” Biden said Wednesday. The U.K. and other European countries have also tightened financial sanctions on Russia. Though they have not thwarted the assault on Ukraine as of yet, the resilience of the much smaller Ukrainian defense shows vulnerability in Russia’s future. Meanwhile, the appearance of mobile cremation machines has been reported alongside killings of Ukrainian civilians still being carried out by Putin-led troops. According to NBC News, reports of sightings of the machines are “credible” but there is no evidence they have been used. The mayor of Mariupol estimated on Wednesday that more than 5,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed in that city alone since late February and that the death toll continues to climb. According to NATO, an estimated 7,000 to 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine six weeks ago, on Feb. 24. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has said that at least 1,300 Ukrainian troops have been killed since then, according to the New York Times. As of Thursday, more than 4.2 million Ukrainians had fled the country, with the majority — upwards of 2.4 million — finding refuge in Poland, according to the U.N. refugee agency. “We want policymakers in all countries to take this seriously,” Mills said. “[We want them] to take war crimes seriously.” _____ Cover thumbnail photo: Leon Klein/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images, Mikhail Klimentyev/AFP via Getty Images",World/Yahoo News,What are Russian 'filtration camps'?,https://news.yahoo.com/what-are-russian-filtration-camps-194643731.html
