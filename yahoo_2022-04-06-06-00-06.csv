4/6/2022,"A fake police officer pulled over a Baylor University student along Interstate 35 on April 1 — but she wasn’t fooled for long, police told news outlets. She was just outside the town of Abbott, about 50 miles south of Fort Worth, when red, white and blue lights started flashing from an unmarked Chevrolet Suburban driving behind her, the Lacy Lakeview Police Department said in a social media post. She was going well under the speed limit, she told TV station KCEN, but thought she might be getting stopped because of expired tags. A man stepped out of the SUV wearing a cowboy hat and a gun, according to police. When he walked up to the student’s window and presented his badge, she noticed there was no badge number, the police post read. Her suspicions only mounted from there. He didn’t have a bulletproof vest on or a typical police uniform, she told KCEN. He didn’t quite look the part, and his behavior was similarly mismatched. “He asked for my license and my registration and I told him that I wasn’t really comfortable,” she said. “It was kind of just the whole situation seemed very off, he seemed kind of frantic.” She decided to call 911, who told her there were no officers in the area performing any traffic stops, according to the LLPD post. At that point, the situation escalated. “The young woman reported that the male began screaming at her to get out of the car when she refused to roll down her window,” the post read. He finally left after she told him she had called 911. He got back into his SUV and sped away. Police are searching for the man and advise anyone with information to call the Hill County Sheriff’s Office at 254-582-5313. The Baylor student’s experience is a good example of what to do in such situations, police said. “We do perform traffic stops regularly and want you to know that at any time you feel unsafe or question the validity of the officer that is approaching your vehicle, we encourage you to call 911,” the post read.

4/6/2022,"Ukraine's military said its air defenses shot down a Russian Su-34 fighter jet near Kharkiv. It published a video showing a fireball plummeting from the sky on Sunday. The Su-34, Russia's newest fighter jet, which cost $36 million each, has underperformed in the war. Ukraine published footage, as well as audio, that it said showed its military shooting down a Sukhoi-34 fighter jet. Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces posted a video on Facebook showing a large burning object plummeting from the sky near the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine, on Sunday. ""Anti-aircraft missile forces of the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine shot down another Russian Su-34 fighter-bomber in Kharkiv region,"" it said in a note describing the video. The Su-34, which Russian state media said costs $36 million per unit, is Russia's newest fighter jet, but it has fallen far short of its promise during the Ukraine conflict. In the Facebook post, the general staff also posted an audio recording of what it said was intercepted Russian military communications. ""Who did they hit? Who did they hit?"" a Russian speaker can be heard asking. The voice asks several times for a response from ""10th,"" perhaps a military call sign. Another Russian speaker is heard saying: ""We're leaving. We're leaving"" ""It's on fire. It's on fire, totally on fire,"" the voice later says. Ukrainian authorities say its armed forces have shot down a number of Su-34s, including on March 27. Insider could not immediately find corroborating evidence of a Su-34 being shot down near Kharkiv. The open-court Ukraine Weapons Tracker Twitter account posted an image on Sunday of a different type of Sukhoi jet shot down in the Kharkiv region. Kharkiv has been one of the hardest-hit cities in Russia's invasion of Ukraine and is still partially surrounded by Russian forces. Russia has withdrawn from other parts of Ukraine in recent days, particularly in the suburbs around the capital of Kyiv. Intelligence officials and the Ukrainian government say they expect Russia to change its approach by focusing its attacks on the east part of the country in the Donbass region. There is mounting evidence suggesting that Russian troops committed mass killings in areas that were under their control, including the killing of 300 civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. On Monday, President Joe Biden called for a war-crimes trial against President Vladimir Putin over the events in Bucha. ""He is a war criminal,"" Biden said of Putin, ""but we have to gather the information.""

4/6/2022,"WASHINGTON — Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) does not seem bothered by far-right figures saying his colleagues support pedophilia because they support Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Supreme Court nomination. “I don’t feel any responsibility for the words of other people,” Hawley told HuffPost on Tuesday. Hawley was the first to criticize Jackson by calling her soft on child pornography offenders last month. He argued that she wrongfully handed out light sentences to people who possessed child sexual abuse images, even though her record in those cases was typical for a federal district judge. Hawley’s criticism resonated with far-right conspiracy theorists who believe Democrats are involved in child sex trafficking rings, and on Monday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) declared that any senator who supports Jackson’s nomination is actually “pro-pedophile.” “You are either a Senator that supports child rapists, child pornography, and the most vile child predators,” Greene said in a Twitter thread. “Or you are a Senator who protects children and votes NO to KJB!” Fifty-three senators, including Republicans Mitt Romney (Utah), Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) voted Monday for a procedural motion to advance Jackson’s nomination. All are now “pro-pedophile,” according to Greene, who likes to boast that she represents the base of the Republican Party rather than its fringe. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) speaking Monday during the Senate Judiciary Committee markup on the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. (Photo: Tom Williams via Getty Images) As with the issue of supposed fraud in the 2020 election, Hawley does not use the same language as the more zealous members of his party — but he doesn’t like to contradict them, either. When asked what he thought of calling a vote for Jackson “pro-pedophile,” Hawley didn’t directly disagree. But he did volunteer that “pro-pedophile” is not an accurate description of Jackson. “I don’t think that Judge Jackson is pro-pedophile. I think she has a judicial philosophy where she thinks these crimes … are over-sentenced, over-criminalized,” Hawley said. “I don’t think she’s in favor of this activity, but I think she’s got a philosophy that leads her to treat these criminals leniently.”  In arguing that Jackson was soft on offenders in child pornography cases, Hawley has relied on the fact that her prison sentences were shorter than federal guidelines, but mostly ignored another fact: that most district judges sentence beneath the guidelines as well. Fifty-nine percent of cases involving possession of child sexual abuse imagery in 2019 resulted in sentences less severe than the guidelines recommended, according to a report published last year by the U.S. Sentencing Commission.  The reason for the lower sentences in cases involving child sexual abuse images, according to the commission, is that the more widespread use of computers has made the guidelines obsolete. Their original intent was to differentiate the severity of offenses at a time when it was more difficult to obtain vast numbers of illicit images. Hawley told HuffPost he believed Jackson’s sentences in child pornography cases were actually more lenient than those of her peers on the bench. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said Monday that her sentences were 33% shorter than the national average from 2015 to 2019 in all criminal cases. “Judge Jackson’s sentences were appropriate exercises of discretion as a judge applying the law to the facts in difficult cases,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said in a floor speech Tuesday. “And it’s interesting to me how the senator from Missouri has carefully drawn lines to exclude Trump appointees to the bench who’ve done exactly what this judge has done as well.” The idea that Democrats support pedophiles has been a mainstay of far-right conspiracy theories for years. In 2016, a North Carolina man traveled to Washington, D.C., and fired an assault rifle inside a pizza restaurant as part of his effort to investigate a supposed Democratic-run child sex trafficking ring operating out of the basement. The so-called Pizzagate story was a predecessor to the QAnon movement, whose adherents helped storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.  Hawley said he was not familiar with Pizzagate or QAnon, even though it was Jackson herself who sentenced the Pizzagate shooter to four years in prison in 2017.

4/6/2022,"Mikhail Khodorkovsky told CNN that Vladimir Putin was at war ""not with Ukraine"" but with NATO. The exiled oligarch said propagandists were preparing Russians ""for an attack on NATO countries."" Khodorkovsky said Putin would prepare to invade the Baltics if he concluded he'd won in Ukraine. The exiled Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky said in an interview with CNN on Sunday that the next step in Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine might be the invasion of the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. ""We must understand that, in his head, Putin is at war not with Ukraine,"" Khodorkovsky said. ""He's at war with the United States and NATO. He said this more than once."" Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon, was considered the wealthiest man in Russia until 2003 when, for what he says were political reasons, Putin charged him with financial crimes and imprisoned him for nine years. Since Khodorkovsky's release in 2013, he has been an outspoken critic of the Kremlin and Putin's government. ""His propagandists have already been started to prepare Russian society for an attack on NATO countries. They're constantly talking about this,"" Khodorkovsky said. ""And this is the preparation of Russian public opinion for this."" Early last month, Khodorkovsky predicted the invasion of Ukraine would end Putin's government. In his Sunday interview with Fareed Zakaria, however, he expressed concern that Putin went ""insane"" when Ukrainians resisted the invasion and that the attacks could escalate. ""I'm absolutely convinced that, if Putin decides that he has won in Ukraine, this is not going to be the last step, the last war,"" Khodorkovsky said. ""The next steps will be the Baltic countries."" Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are all members of NATO. President Joe Biden said early after Russia invaded Ukraine that the US would ""defend every inch of NATO territory,"" and he's moved American troops into the region.

4/6/2022,"Controversial Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) took to the House floor on Monday to educate troll his fellow representatives on the definition of a woman. “I never imagined that one of my sacred duties in this hallowed chamber would be explaining to the House Speaker the difference between a man and a woman,” he said, referencing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). “Take notes, Madame Speaker, I’m about to define what a woman is for you.” Cawthorn then offered this tasteless definition: “XX chromosomes, no tallywacker.” “It’s so simple,” Cawthorn said. “And yet, today, this proclamation of fundamental scientific fact will cause the woke liberals in Silicon Valley to strip you of your voice and ban you until you bow at their altar of falsehoods.” Cawthorn’s comment seemed to be in response to an interaction that took place during Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Senate confirmation hearings, during which she was asked to define the word “woman” by Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.). Jackson declined to offer a definition and responded, “I’m not a biologist.” Although many conservatives made hay with the remark, USA Today noted that many scientists, gender law scholars and philosophers of biology say there is no sufficient way to clearly define what makes someone a woman. Gender has become a hot-button talking point on the right amid a wave of anti-transgender bills proposed in state legislatures around the country. Among them is Texas’ law that would classify gender-affirming care for transgender kids as child abuse and is currently facing legal challenges. Meanwhile, Twitter users weren’t impressed by Cawthorn’s comments. Cawthorn has been on somewhat of a roll recently, after angering his fellow Republicans by claiming various top “leaders” had invited him to orgies and had also used cocaine in front of him. He also came under fire for calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “thug” and for driving with a revoked license. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

4/6/2022,"The Coast Guard Cutter Donald Horsley crew and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration special agents offloaded about 1,000 kilograms of seized cocaine at Coast Guard Base San Juan on Monday. The blow didn’t get very far. A team of law enforcement officials found the drugs aboard a go-fast vessel in the Caribbean Sea near Puerto Rico on March 30. According to the Coast Guard, the seized coke has an estimated wholesale value of about $20 million. The offload comes two days after another U.S. Coast Guard crew offloaded more than $160 million worth of cocaine at its base in Miami Beach after a 45-day patrol in the Caribbean. That capture seized about 8,500 pounds of the powder and the detaining of 13 suspected drug smugglers from the Dominican Republic and Colombia, according to the Coast Guard. $20 million worth of cocaine found on a boat is now in the hands of the U.S. In the latest incident, the crew of a Customs and Border Protection multi-mission enforcement aircraft on a routine patrol spotted a 35-foot go-fast boat in waters near Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. Coast Guard watchstanders in Sector San Juan were alerted and sent out the 154-foot fast response cutter, Donald Horsley, out of its San Juan port. The crew interdicted the speedy boat, which was carrying two men, Dominican Republic nationals, “and multiple bales of suspected contraband” that the Coast Guard said tested positive for cocaine. The men were taken into custody and the 33 bales of cocaine were seized. “This case highlights the Coast Guard’s unwavering resolve and that of our fellow partners to interdict drug smuggling vessels at sea and safeguard the nation’s southernmost maritime border,” Capt. Gregory H. Magee, Sector San Juan commander, said in a statement. “These partnerships are key to achieving to protecting our citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from drug trafficking and other smuggling threats in the Caribbean.” U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Special Agents took custody of the two men and the coke and are leading the investigation.",U.S./Miami Herald,That $20 million in cocaine offloaded by the Coast Guard?
