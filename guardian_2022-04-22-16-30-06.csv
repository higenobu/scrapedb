4/22/2022,"Retail sales in Great Britain fell by more than expected last month as the soaring prices of food and fuel caused consumers to rein in their spending amid growing fears over the cost of living. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed retail sales volumes dropped by 1.4% in March, after a decline of 0.5% a month earlier as shoppers adjusted to rising costs. City economists had forecast a drop of 0.3%. Darren Morgan, a director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: “Retail sales fell back notably in March, with rises in the cost of living hitting consumers’ spending. Online sales were hit particularly hard due to lower levels of discretionary spending.” Spending on food fell for the fifth consecutive month as supermarkets reported a sharp drop in sales alongside declines for butchers and bakers, as well as an 11.3% fall in spending at alcohol and tobacco stores. The ONS said some of the drop in spending could be explained by consumers returning to pubs and restaurants after the easing of pandemic restrictions, although it warned the impact of rising food prices on the cost of living was also hurting retail sales. Fears for a marked slowdown in consumer spending have intensified in recent weeks, with surveys showing the public has grown gloomier about the economy than when banks were on the brink of collapse during the 2008 financial crisis. Figures from the ONS show 87% of adults reported a rise in living costs in late March, compared with 62% in November. Against a backdrop of soaring global energy prices and rising cost of a weekly shop, inflation reached 7% in March – the highest level since 1992 – and is forecast to rise further this month after a record increase in household gas and electricity prices. The Bank of England has warned the measure for the rising cost of living could hit 10% later this year, the highest level since the early 1980s. With prices for petrol and diesel hitting a record high last month as the Russia-Ukraine war ripples through global oil and gas markets, fuel sales across Great Britain fell 3.8% in March as households cut back on non-essential travel. The ONS said online spending fell to 26% as a proportion of total sales – the lowest since February 2020, immediately before the Covid-19 pandemic spread – with consumers returning to shopping on the high street and as families cut back on non-essentials. Online sales soared during lockdown, hitting a peak of 37.1% in February 2021. Although expected to fall back as the economy reopened, spending remains much higher than before the pandemic, when online retail accounted for about a fifth of overall sales.",News/Business,Retail sales fall in Great Britain as food and petrol prices soar,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/22/retail-sales-fall-in-great-britain-as-food-and-petrol-prices-soar
4/22/2022,"In a usually stable country like Britain, how periods of crisis are portrayed and remembered is a very powerful political weapon. For nearly half a century, the turmoil of the 1970s and the sense that the decade’s governments couldn’t cope have been used by the Conservatives to argue that Labour is never truly fit for office. Despite the relative competence of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s premierships – a competence that Keir Starmer aspires to now – the association between Labour governments and chaos has never been completely broken.  This picture of the 1970s is highly selective. The decade also brought many Britons greater freedom and equality, and the Conservatives were in power for almost half of it. But these realities have not lessened the influence of the Tory narrative. Constantly presented by rightwing newspapers, politicians and historians, it has a powerful simplicity. For the many voters who have seen post-imperial Britain as a country in decline, Labour’s struggling 1970s prime ministers have been perfect scapegoats.  But now that problems supposedly unique to that decade, such as out-of-control inflation, panic buying by the public and other disruptions to everyday life, have recurred under Boris Johnson, a fundamental rethink of our political past and present has become possible. If the Conservatives are finally to be removed from power, this rethink may be essential.  Johnson’s failures as prime minister ought to cast his 1970s predecessors in a new light. If he, with a big majority, an often sycophantic press and a limited opposition, can still seem so out of his depth, then we should stop being so dismissive of the efforts of Edward Heath, Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan to govern Britain in a much more hostile political environment, which had frequent hung parliaments, more independent political journalism and Margaret Thatcher waiting to pounce. The three men’s policies often failed, but never as disastrously as Johnson’s. Callaghan’s inability to maintain good relations with the unions ultimately led, in the winter of discontent, to some dead people being left unburied. That infamous episode looks trivial next to Johnson’s lethal complacency about Covid.  He and his defenders often argue that his impact as prime minister has been limited by disruptive global events. Yet so were the governments of the 1970s: that decade’s two energy crises, just like today’s, increased inflation and reduced economic growth. We need to acknowledge that any modern British government, in a middling country with limited influence, can be thrown off course by external events. If we accept this, the power of the 1970s as the great cautionary tale of British politics will significantly wane. For Labour, the resemblance of the Johnson era to modern Britain’s supposed nadir presents a double opportunity. Not only to neutralise a political negative once and for all, but also to position the Conservatives rather than themselves in voters’ minds as the party of disorder. For months, Starmer and his shadow ministers have included references to “Conservative chaos” in their public statements. In the absence of compelling Labour policies – however welcome some of them are, for example on strengthening the rights of employees – Starmer’s main strategy is to play on voters’ growing exasperation and anxiety about Johnson’s inability to govern, and to promise that life under Labour would be safer and calmer.  In theory, this is a shrewd approach. In some ways, Britain is even more turbulent now than in the 1970s: more fragmented by nationalism, more polarised by wealth and poverty, more clamorous with discontent thanks to social media, and more disgusted at its ruling class. The Tories have been in power much longer than they or Labour were in the 1970s, and their sense of entitlement and their self-serving behaviour are much worse, as Partygate continues to expose. There was plenty of corruption in Britain in the 1970s, but compared with Johnson’s cosiness with the super-rich - the likes of Evgeny Lebedev – the lives of our 1970s prime ministers seem quite modest: Heath went sailing, Callaghan had a farm, Wilson owned a holiday bungalow in the Scilly Isles. The Conservatives’ current air of decadence and casual destructiveness may have no precedent in our modern history.  And yet they could easily win the next election. Labour’s poll lead is much smaller and less solid than those Blair and Thatcher achieved as opposition leaders. The difference is that today’s electorate has not definitely had enough of the status quo. Part of the problem for Labour is that, unlike Thatcher in the 1970s, it does not have a chorus of supportive newspapers constantly declaring that Britain is in crisis. Nor, unlike then, is there general and open discontent among the establishment about the state of the country. As with Brexit, there are mutterings and isolated outbursts, but most business leaders, for example, are quiet, despite the Conservatives’ dead-end economic policies, calculating that the Tories may yet win another term. Even many left-of-centre Britons, pessimistic after multiple election defeats, can be reluctant to connect the mess Johnson has made of the country to his party’s electoral prospects. To adapt the famous line about capitalism attributed to the theorist Fredric Jameson, many leftists find it easier to imagine the end of Britain than the end of Tory rule.  It’s virtually a heresy to say now, but the closest Labour has come to a really effective critique of the Conservatives’ record in power since 2010 was at the 2017 election. Labour’s manifesto described the frayed and desperate condition of much of Britain in clear and resonant language, and that systemic condemnation, at least as much as Jeremy Corbyn’s actual policies, caused the surge in Labour support. When the party offered less critique and more policy at the 2019 election, its vote shrivelled.  Yet Starmer, in his determination to dissociate himself from “Mr Corbyn”, as he called him with theatrical distaste in the Commons this week, has disconnected Labour from the sort of broadbrush but morally and emotionally potent politics that Corbyn reawakened. Starmer is trying to condemn the whole Tory status quo while also presenting himself as a cautious figure. As Thatcher’s victory in 1979 showed, voters often prefer politicians offering to rescue the country to be radicals.  However, it’s not realistic to expect Starmer’s Labour, or the other opposition parties, to crystallise what is wrong with Johnson’s Britain on their own. If the chaos of these years is to be properly remembered, not just at the next election but for decades afterwards, then that work also needs to be done by journalists, historians, activists and voters. Unless enough of us decide these are the worst of times, the Conservatives will swagger on. Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,The Tories profited from Labour ‘chaos’ in the 1970s.

4/22/2022,"Drew can’t take the tension in TV dramas and has to leave the room. It’s infuriating Drew, my husband, won’t binge-watch any TV dramas with me. He says it’s too intense, especially when we’re relaxing at home in the evening after work. But he’s fine with indulging in comedies or something light. It’s annoying, because modern dramas are made for bingeing, but Drew can’t handle it. When things are really exciting or tense, he will leave the room, or ask to stop the episode completely. It’s infuriating. We abandoned Ozark because Drew would say, “I can’t cope with this tonight.” Now I’ve forgotten what’s happened and who’s killed who. We’re now watching half an episode of Succession, twice a week. I am completely into it and want to speed up, but Drew says there are too many awkward and painful scenes to watch an episode in its entirety. He says he wants to finish the series, but we’ve lost momentum and I’m getting bored. Drew says watching other families fall apart on TV isn’t an enjoyable way to relax. I have to remind him he’s not actually living in the show. I’m a therapist, so perhaps I’m used to conflict. I also grew up in a family where we’d have a massive row, then laugh about it a few hours later. Drew’s family are the opposite. He’s a surgeon, so completely fine with blood, guts and action on screen, but the minute he sees a little bit of interpersonal conflict, he wants to switch off. His attention span is fine with other things, though. He’s happy to play a game for an hour and a half, but not to watch TV with me. I don’t need to binge four hours of TV in one go, but I’d like Drew to be more open to watching one or even two episodes of drama a night. We’re on this journey together, and lose track of the story when we stop. Watching a drama is a bit like reading a book: you need to read a chapter or two a night, especially when it’s a bit complicated. Watching half an episode of a show is pointless and unsatisfying, as each episode is designed to be enjoyed in full. Drew needs to stop moving at a snail’s pace. I don’t like to watch shows where families are falling apart. I get too invested I’m not a monster; I can binge-watch sometimes, but usually only light comedy shows like Schitt’s Creek, where the stakes aren’t so high. When there’s too much conflict, I’m like, “Oh, that’s enough now.” Claire wants to watch a couple of hours of TV drama each night, but that’s too much for me. I don’t like to watch shows where families fall apart or people’s lives implode. Claire and I have two kids and both work hard. I want our free time together to be relaxing. Claire says: “It’s entertainment; you’re not directly involved.” I realise that, but I do get invested. It’s especially hard when I can relate to the protagonist because it’s another man who looks like me. It’s easier for me to watch half an episode, because most shows resolve the conflict from the previous episode at the start, before introducing a new conflict and ramping up the tension towards a cliff-hanger. If you stop in the middle of one, you avoid the worst of the suspense until you feel like finishing it, usually later in the week. Claire gets annoyed that I can focus on a computer game and not a show, but a game involves zero stress. A family drama is the opposite. In other areas of my life, I can deal with conflict, but I don’t especially like it. When I was a child, a family conflict in our household was a nuclear event – something to be avoided at all costs. When it did happen, there’d would be three days of fallout. Now I’m a surgeon. I always wanted a job where I could just focus on practical tasks. We’re watching Succession at the moment, but I find it stressful. During the big family argument scenes I get up and pace around, or leave the room. I know it annoys Claire, but I can’t help it. Every episode builds to some kind of family showdown. It’s like listening to your neighbours argue through the wall. I also think dramas are too long these days. As a student I could binge a whole box set, but now the thought of 30 hours of TV is intimidating. I can’t see myself ever truly binge-watching – unless it’s something fluffy and light. Should Drew watch more TV dramas with Claire? What’s on TV isn’t actually the real drama here. They clearly both want to spend more time with each other, but Claire can’t force her tastes on Drew – she needs to be more flexible. They should find activities that they both enjoy: go karting! Crocheting! Falconry! The world’s their oyster!William, 31 I’m surprised by Claire’s lack of empathy towards Drew. Maybe because her job is to help people understand the emotional responses of others, at home she wants to switch off from Drew’s stress and unease. If he doesn’t want to watch these kinds of programmes, Claire is welcome to watch them on her own.Catherine, 50 Oh dear! Claire doesn’t seem to be taking her work home. Drew shouldn’t have to watch content that he finds triggering. They should find things they can watch together, otherwise Claire can have her TV while Drew plays his games.Ben, 54 It appears to me that Drew is always catered to by Claire – his choices are paramount in their viewing schedule. Claire should be able to watch her favourite shows without always appeasing Drew. He should grow up and realise that TV programmes are not real life.Brenda, 70 Drew shouldn’t agree to watching a TV show with Claire if he knows he’ll disrupt the flow of it. Half an episode is pointless. However, he’s not wrong for wanting to watch light TV to decompress. Time for Claire to binge a drama by herself and for them to find a middle-ground comedy drama to watch together.Amy, 24 So now you can be the judge.

4/22/2022,"Northern Ireland will need to lose more than 1 million sheep and cattle to meet its new legally binding climate emissions targets, according to an industry-commissioned analysis seen by the Guardian. The large-scale reduction in farm animals comes after the passing of the ​​jurisdiction’s first ever climate act, requiring the farming sector to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and reduce methane emissions by almost 50% over the same period.About a third of human-caused methane emissions come from livestock, mostly from the burps and manure of beef and dairy cattle. Analysis by KPMG, commissioned by industry representatives including the Ulster Farmers’ Union (UFU), estimates more than 500,000 cattle and about 700,000 sheep would need to be lost in order for Northern Ireland to meet the new climate targets.Separate analysis by the UK government’s climate advisers suggests chicken numbers would also need to be cut by 5 million by 2035. Both the pig and poultry sectors in Nothern Ireland have seen rapid growth in the past decade. Northern Ireland has for some years been the only devolved administration without dedicated climate legislation and targets for emissions reduction. The region’s agrifood industry and associated farming groups have long raised concerns about the expected impact of emissions reductions.Agriculture accounts for about 27% of Northern Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions, with the vast majority coming from livestock. Its heavily export-driven meat industry principally supplies Great Britain, but it also exports to China and North America.The country’s principal poultry processor, Moy Park (a subsidiary of the Brazilian meat giant JBS), has grown into one of Europe’s biggest such firms and Northern Ireland’s largest company, while the Armagh-based JMW Farms pig producer saw its gross turnover nearly treble to £54m between 2011 and 2020.A spokesperson for KPMG said: “Under the [Climate Change Act’s] net-zero target, we have assumed that ‘beef and other cattle’, ‘dairy’ and ‘sheep’ do the most work to decarbonise due to these sectors accounting for the largest livestock-related impact on NI’s carbon emissions.“Both the ‘pig’ and ‘poultry’ sectors have a minor impact on agriculture carbon emissions (2% and 1%, respectively) and, therefore, any effort to decarbonise can be assumed to have a minor impact on total carbon emissions.”Ewa Kmietowicz, head of the land use mitigations team at the Climate Change Committee (CCC), said: “If you look at the evidence on the lifecycle of greenhouse gas emissions, the red meat livestock sources – beef, dairy, sheep – have the highest emissions because they’re ruminant and they have high methane emissions.“But pigs and poultry also have a lot of indirect emissions through fodder growth and supply. A lot of food for pigs is imported in the UK, which wouldn’t necessarily impact on UK territorial emissions, but it’s still important because we don’t want to increase consumption emissions for the UK.”Chris Stark, CCC chief executive, told the Guardian that a switch to arable farming would probably be necessary if food production levels are to remain the same in Northern Ireland. “A condition in our modelling is that we produce the same amount of food per head in 2050,” he said. “But it’s very difficult to do this unless you see a change in farming practice, and especially unless you see a shift in arable farming versus livestock. “So it’s a big challenge – and I’m interested to see what the executive comes up with now, since the majority of emissions come from animals. That will very soon come home to roost for Northern Ireland.”The devolved Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs has been contacted for comment.Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the biggest farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

4/22/2022,"Magnus Carlsen has again stated that he is “unlikely” to defend his world title against the winner of the eight-player Candidates scheduled for Madrid in June and explained that he felt more comfortable in the years before 2013 when he was ranked No 1 but had not yet defeated India’s Vishy Anand in the world title match in Chennai. Since then Carlsen has won five championship matches – twice against Anand, and one each against Russia’s Sergey Karjakin, Fabiano Caruana of the US, and Russia’s Ian Nepolmiachtchi. Carlsen’s statement, made in an interview with the Norwegian newspaper VG, goes further than when he last spoke about the title following his crushing win over Nepomniachtchi in December. Then his stance was that he would only play a challenger from a younger generation, which pointed to 18-year-old Alireza Firouzja, formerly of Iran and now of France, who in 2021 became the youngest in chess history to achieve a 2800 rating,a recognised level for world champions and challengers. This time there is no reference to Firouzja, who has played little since his successes of last autumn, but is assumed to have been preparing opening bombs and is still firmly installed among the Candidates favourites. Against Firouzja is the poor record of teenage candidates, as Bobby Fischer (twice), Boris Spassky and Carlsen himself all failed to win, while the youngest ever world champions remain Garry Kasparov and Carlsen at age 22, followed by Mikhail Tal and Anatoly Karpov at 23. That still leaves a practical question which will be answered only in June. Will Carlsen still abandon his title if the challenger’s backers can increase the prize fund considerably from its present level of €2m? The amounts now are much larger, but the problem is essentially the same as in 1972 when Bobby Fischer dithered in New York when the opening ceremony of his series against Boris Spassky was due to start in Reykjavik. That historic match, and the global chess boom which followed it, were saved when the Fide president, Max Euwe, postponed the match for two days, during which the English financier and chess enthusiast Jim Slater doubled the prize fund from $125,000 to $250,000 and Fischer took the next plane out to Iceland. If either of the two Americans, Caruana or Hikaru Nakamura, becomes the official challenger there must be a serious chance of a bid from Rex Sinquefied, the billionaire who has made his home city St Louis into a global chess centre and is an admirer of Bobby Fischer, who he once met on a plane journey and exhorted him to “beat those Russians”. Sinquefield, if he wished, could afford to double the prize fund as an echo of 1972. There are also plausible scenarios where Carlsen refuses to play and, following Fide rules, the winner and runner-up meet for the world championship. That would effectively produce two world champions, as happened between 1993 and 2006, a 13-year hiatus which would probably be much shorter this time due to the widespread wish for a new reunification match. While Firouzja is the principal teenage contender, others are improving fast. Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa, 16, won this month’s Reykjavik Open and is already being hailed by some Indian media as the next world champion. Carlsen and Praggnandhaa are both among the eight competitors in the Oslo Esports Cup, starting on Friday at 5pm. This is an online event but with the difference that all the players will be based in the same broadcasting studio. It is the third event in the 2022 Meltwater Champions Tour and Carlsen, who won the 2021 Tour and both the first two tournaments in 2022, will be aiming to continue his monopoly. However, Praggnanandhaa defeated the world champion in February at the Airthings Masters to become the youngest player to beat Carlsen in serious competition. Praggnanadhaa’s achievements are being fully matched on an age to rating yardstick by Abhimanyu Mishra, 13, and Dommaraju Gukesh, 15. Mishra became the youngest ever grandmaster at 12, beating the long standing age record set by Karjakin in 2002, He achieved his title via all-play-all tournaments in Budapest which were criticised as too artificial, but at Reykjavik Mishra answered his critics by sharing second prize. His rating has advanced well into the 2500s, and serious Californian money is backing him to rise to the top. Gukesh is a year younger than Praggnandhaa, but has already broken into the world top 100 players. The 15-year-old has come a long way from four years ago when his behaviour when winning on time in a lost position angered Nigel Short. Gukesh’s style at Reykjavik and when taking first at La Roda last weekend showed a fiercely accurate and economical style with a variety of standard openings. Almost all his wins at La Roda were in under 30 moves and it was like watching the teenage Fischer and Spassky in the 1950s. Two games stood out. One as Black, where he castled short before storming the white king with his K-side pawns, and the other as White against an international master, where his h4-h5-h6 push stymied Black’s defensive options. 3812 1 Qe8+ Kh7 2 Ng5+! hxg5 3 Rh3+ Kg6 4 Rh6+! and if Kxh6 5 Qh8+ Kg6 5 Qh5 mate or if gxh6 6 Qg8 mate.",Sport/Sport,"Chess: Magnus Carlsen ‘unlikely’ to defend crown, but questions remain",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/22/chess-magnus-carlsen-unlikely-to-defend-crown-but-questions-remain
4/22/2022,"Heartstopper (Netflix) may not quite live up to the dramatic promise of its title, but this adorable teen romance is a heartwarmer, at the very least. Adapted by the writer Alice Oseman from her graphic novel series of the same name, it follows 14-year-old Charlie as he develops a crush on popular rugby player Nick, after they bond over whether it is appropriate or not to do your homework on the way to maths. It is unutterably sweet and wholesome, and by the end of its zippy eight episodes, it leaves the sensation of being on the receiving end of a solid hug. Charlie is already out at school, and has experienced some bullying as a result, but seems to have settled into a supportive friendship group who value their film nights and send each other a lot of DMs. (There is much on-screen messaging in this, and watching characters write, delete, rewrite and re-delete their replies is tensely effective.) Charlie has a secret sort-of-boyfriend, Ben, who meets up with him in the library at break time, but who picks on him when anyone else is around. When Ben progresses from treating him coldly to getting a girlfriend then belittling him when they are together, Nick comes to the rescue, and their friendship slowly builds towards something else. It is so completely lovely. It nods to its origins as a graphic novel with moments of animation, particularly when emotions run high. Hands almost touch; cartoon lightning crackles between them. Charlie’s friend Elle wonders if she has feelings for their other friend, Tao, and hearts appear in the air. It looks like Hollyoaks with an art-school twist. There are minor dramas among Charlie’s friends, but mostly it’s about Charlie and Nick. The adults are practically nonexistent, bar the odd cameo from a parent and Stephen Fry, whose voice appears as the headteacher speaking over the Tannoy. I am not quite sure who the target audience is. It certainly feels aimed at a young crowd, and if teenagers are watching Euphoria now, then this feels more like a throwback to Byker Grove/Grange Hill days. There are double dates with milkshakes and lots of meaningful hugs. But it has a modern sophistication, too, with its emotionally articulate protagonists, who have a surprisingly mature grasp of sexuality as a spectrum. An exploration of bisexuality, for example, is handled with care, though it helps that in this case Olivia Colman is the understanding mum, a role she suits very well. Charlie joins the rugby team, in part to pursue his crush on Nick, but also to protest against the idea that he won’t be any good since he is supposed to be a certain type of gay boy. “Wow, being a teenager is terrible,” says the caring art teacher, and after watching the episode about a rich kid’s 16th birthday party, few would be inclined to disagree. But the truth is that, in this world, being a teenager doesn’t seem so bad. The adults are lovely, siblings are friendly, and most of the kids are pleasant enough. It isn’t a rainbow-tinted paradise entirely – there is some homophobia, mostly through a lack of understanding and/or driven by curiosity, and Ben’s self-loathing finds a nasty release in his treatment of Charlie. Mostly, however, Charlie’s friends, including a pair of old-soul lesbians whose purpose seems to be to help everyone become more comfortable with who they are, give him all the support he needs. For this old cynic, such wholesomeness is a little hard to adjust to, and I am certainly not the audience its makers had in mind. But by the time I finish Heartstopper, I understand its appeal. It is a comic book fantasy about LGBTQ+ teenagers, and as such, it softens any hard edges and amplifies the sweetness of the romance at its centre. There is something altogether soothing about the time spent in its company.",Arts/Television & radio,Heartstopper review – possibly the loveliest show on TV,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/22/heartstopper-review-alice-oseman-netflix-tv-drama
4/22/2022,"When Lincoln Barrett started making drum’n’bass tracks in the late 90s, he says, “people were kind of mocking me for being into it. People were already saying drum’n’bass is dead. Going into the record shop in Cardiff, Catapult, you would kind of get the piss taken out of you by people who were, I guess, into trance.” He laughs. In the intervening period, Barrett became High Contrast, one of the most respected drum’n’bass producers in the world: he’s about to celebrate the 20th anniversary of his debut album, True Colours. Drum’n’bass, meanwhile, has steadfastly refused to die – in fact, it is enjoying an unexpected moment in the sun, freshening up 2022’s pop music. “It’s people who aren’t really part of the drum’n’bass scene just coming through and doing jungle in their own way, and it’s really in a separate lane from established artists and what drum’n’bass is now,” says Barrett. “It’s amazing that it’s been led mainly by young women artists as well.” At its most extreme, the pop drum’n’bass wave has manifested itself in Australian producer Luude’s breakbeat reworking of Men at Work’s 80s hit Down Under, a Top 5 novelty hit that features Men at Work frontman Colin Hay and that, as the journalist, author and presenter of the Drum&BassArena awards, Dave Jenkins, delicately notes, “has caused all kinds of debates”. He laughs as he quotes drum’n’bass legend Shy FX: “If any self-respecting drum’n’bass DJs play this, they need to look at themselves hard in the mirror and slap themselves twice.” At last count, the track had racked up 102m streams on Spotify alone. Less obviously adjacent to the fromagerie, there are the artists whose work finds its way on to Spotify’s Planet Rave playlist, apparently the fastest-growing playlist on the platform among 18- to 24-year-olds. Not everyone on it deals in drum’n’bass. There are latterday two-step garage producers, people dabbling in trance, old-fashioned hardcore and even the occasional appearance from venerable electronic artists including Aphex Twin. That notwithstanding, the sheer volume and variety of artists wedded to 175bpm breakbeats seems striking. There are indie bands dabbling in drum’n’bass, not least Porij, with the wispy My Bloody Valentine-esque single Figure Skating. There are hyperpop-adjacent artists welding super-fast breaks to four-to-the-floor kick drums. There’s PinkPantheress, the bedroom producer and chart star whose track Reason has done much to break the genre open to a gen Z fanbase. There are emo-seeming types with manga illustrations instead of artist photos, lots of Xs and Vs in their names and song titles that one assumes are tongue-in-cheek: xxtarlit has an online mix called Bad Goth Bitch Music To Cut/Worship Lucifer To. There is Vierre Cloud, a 20-year-old Australian catapulted to online ubiquity when a Fortnite gamer used one of his tracks as the closing music on his YouTube videos And Nia Archives, a half-Jamaican, Yorkshire-born singer/producer/DJ who claims inspiration from Roni Size, Remarc and Lemon D, writes tracks that deal with mental health and body dysphoria, has been outspoken in her attempts to attract more women of colour into the drum’n’bass scene and shows every sign of becoming a breakout star. And there is goddard., a fan of august drum’n’bass labels Hospital and Ram in his teens, who makes soulful vocal tracks that seem aimed squarely at the dancefloor, but which clock in at pop-single length; hardly anything he does exceeds three minutes. “When I was studying at uni, one of the things we spoke about was people’s attentiveness through the digital revolution, how it has shortened,” he explains from his studio in Kettering, Northamptonshire. “The necessity of grabbing people’s attention straight away, and maintaining that, is really important. When you’re making stuff to release on streaming services, you have to think: are people going to listen for five minutes? Probably not. It’s just how we’ve evolved.” Almost all of it has a distinct pop edge: even the artists with the manga imagery and the dark song titles have a tendency to sample the cute strains of Opus III’s It’s a Fine Day or Ellie Goulding’s Starry Eyed. Indeed, there seems to be an entire sub-genre, pitched somewhere between drum’n’bass and bedroom pop, that sets breaks against soft, wide-eyed-sounding female vocals: Yaz’s Mr Valentine; Take Van’s Time Goes By; oOo’s Frou Frou-sampling Wedbecutetoget-her; piri and Tommy Villiers’ feathery Soft Spot, and Beachin’. The latter duo are a couple; they went on a date in Manchester and subsequently started making music together in a bedroom studio. Their ambitions were modest – piri says she paid three TikTok creators to use Soft Spot in their videos and asked for support from the online community Manchester Student Group – but it went viral: it currently soundtracks 110,000 TikTok videos, featuring everything from footage of someone laying a laminate floor to advice on how to get rid of period cramps. Charli XCX announced it was her preferred gym soundtrack (“it goes so hard”) while PinkPantheress – whose use of drum’n’bass breaks was “massively influential” on their sound – DMed the duo to tell them she loved the track. “I think people just haven’t taken a very pop angle on drum’n’bass beats until recently,” says Piri. “It makes it more accessible if there’s a pop song over the top of it, these dreamy vocals, because a lot of people won’t just listen to instrumental music, they need a vocal and song. And obviously, drum’n’bass is sick.” The question of what has prompted all this is an intriguing one. Clearly some form of nostalgia plays a role. Sometimes it appears to be the rosy second-hand variety involving an era you’re too young to remember: Planet Rave is thick with twentysomething producers using graphics derived from old PlayStation games or calling tracks things like planet1995; producers seem enthralled by the way drum’n’bass was made in an era before technology advanced (“Adam F’s Circles, that’s one of the best drum’n’bass tracks ever,” says Villiers, “and I don’t know how it was made, but it definitely wasn’t on a Mac, man”). Sometimes it’s more direct and personal. “I grew up around soundsystem culture, as half of my family are Jamaican, and I was always drawn to that sound, the drums and the distorted bass,” Nia Archives told an interviewer this year, adding – and any original junglists may want to look away now, lest they feel impossibly ancient – “my nana loves jungle”. Jenkins points out that drum’n’bass enjoyed one of its few pop crossover moments in the middle of the average zoomer’s childhood. “DJ Fresh had the first-ever drum’n’bass No 1 with Hot Right Now 10 years ago. Then you had Sigma and Matrix & Futurebound, artists who could see the potential to experiment with songwriting and see if drum’n’bass could exist in the mainstream. It was controversial at the time, there was a kind of jumping the shark moment when Sigma collaborated with Take That … but when you’re young and you get that first flavour of something, you can dig deeper and refine your tastes. I think that it brought this tempo and those type of breakbeats to the mainstream pop vocabulary and this is what we’re enjoying now.” Perhaps there are other, more prosaic reasons. goddard. thinks it might be bound up with global events over the past couple of years, that the in-your-face exhilaration of fast breakbeats provided both escapism during lockdown and a perfect soundtrack when pent-up kids were allowed out. “I think when lockdown happened, people like [DJ] Dom Whiting came along, making videos of himself on his bike, playing drum’n’bass, just on his own, then you’d see people coming out of their houses because they were low and this music made them feel happier. That really put drum’n’bass out there publicly, for every type of listener, because it was just good energy. [Post-lockdown] feels like a very exciting time for drum’n’bass because it feels like there’s a lot of energy in the air.” Piri, meanwhile, suggests pop artists might have gravitated to the genre because of the way music is disseminated in 2022. No latterday artist I speak to has come up through the more traditional route of having their music played in a club – all of them have relied on social media for exposure. “You can get a lot of information from the song in a shorter period of time. It keeps you stimulated,” she says. “A verse in a house song is going to be longer than a verse in a drum’n’bass song. On TikTok, you have to make a very strong vibe in 15 seconds, and in drum’n’bass, you can get a whole chorus within 15 seconds, just because it’s faster.” The means by which people now access music might also account for the current wave of producers’ preference for one specific area of drum’n’bass’s history: on Planet Rave you hear a lot of tracks audibly influenced by jungle, the raw, reggae-influenced, sample-friendly precursor that, as Barrett points out, “was seen as ancient history” by the late 90s. “For a long time, the drum’n’bass production standard has been insanely high,” says Jenkins. “I think we’re finding an inverse situation where a new generation has come through and they’re like: ‘I don’t care about the mixdowns, I’m listening to this through earbuds’ – especially in the last two years, when they don’t even have to think about club reactions at all. Those really rough, energetic, scratchy breaks have come back in a big way. If you put incredibly well-produced sub-bass on a track, it’ll be lost completely on people who are watching TikTok on their phones.” What happens to all this stuff in the future is a moot point. It could be a fad, it could produce lasting stars, it could establish itself as a permanent fixture in the pop landscape. “Maybe there’s a degree of fickle hipsters,” chuckles Barrett. “I guess if it’s going to have legs, it’s down to whether this new generation are not just thinking about what it was 20 years ago, they’re using it as a tool today, to make something different.” Not that its continued success or failure will affect the longevity of drum’n’bass itself, he says. “It’s out there on its own in terms of tempo, it gives an energy that no other genre can, so it just sounds great at festivals, in a rave, outdoors … There will always be a market for that, because you’re not getting it anywhere else. People will always want that energy boost.”",Arts/Music,‘It’s just good energy!’ How TikTok and Covid made drum’n’bass hot again,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/its-just-good-energy-how-tiktok-and-covid-made-drumnbass-hot-again
4/22/2022,"The editor of a now-closed Singaporean news outlet has been jailed for three weeks for defamation over a letter published on the site that alleged corruption among government ministers. Terry Xu, the former editor of the Online Citizen, was convicted last year for the publication of a letter that said there was “corruption at the highest echelons”. The Online Citizen was known for its relatively liberal stance and for featuring criticism of the authorities in the city-state, where media is tightly controlled. It was closed last year after Singapore’s media regulator rescinded its licence, stating it had failed to declare the sources of its funding. Regulator the Infocomm Media Development Authority said it was necessary for the site to do so to avoid foreign actors from influencing domestic politics. Xu had said he did not want to betray the confidentiality of the site’s subscribers. Xu’s jailing adds to fears over worsening of media freedoms in Singapore, which ranks 160th out of 180 territories in Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index, behind Belarus and Russia. On Thursday, the district judge Ng Peng Hong said a jail term was warranted for Xu considering “the nature of the allegation, the standing of the defamed parties, as well as the wide spread of the publication”. The author of the letter, Daniel De Costa Augustin, was sentenced to three months and three weeks, after he was convicted of defamation and breaking computer crime laws for sending the letter from another person’s email account without their consent. In a statement posted on Facebook after the sentencing, Xu described the charge against him and the police investigation as “selective and unfair”. The letter had made no mention of individuals or entities, he said. “I am opting to serve my sentence with immediate effect and not asking for a stay of sentence even though I am appealing against the conviction. I am not afraid of the jail sentence imposed upon me and strongly deny the charge placed before me,” Xu said. Separately, Xu and another Online Citizen writer were ordered to pay substantial damages last year after losing a defamation suit against the prime ministe, Lee Hsien Loong. Rights groups and press freedom advocates accuse Singapore of using defamation suits and other draconian laws to suppress critical coverage. Last year, parliament passed a foreign interference law that granted broad powers to the authorities, including the ability to compel internet service providers and social media platforms to provide user information and block content they deem hostile. A fake news law came into effect in 2019, which gave ministers the power to order social media sites to put warnings next to posts they consider false.

4/22/2022,"Thousands of Maasai pastoralists in northern Tanzania have written to the UK and US governments and the EU appealing for help to stop plans to evict them from their ancestral land. More than 150,000 Maasai people face eviction by the Tanzanian government due to moves by the UN cultural agency Unesco and a safari company to use the land for conservation and commercial hunting. “We are asking for your help to let our government know that our land is not for sale and that we will continue to resist this longstanding assault on our rights and the ecological integrity of our land. We are therefore calling on your organisation to speak out against these abuses and help us prevent the extinction of our people,” read the letter. “You can keep providing funding to those responsible for appropriating our land in the name of profit or you can make it clear to our government that you will not stand by as our right to live peacefully on and conserving our land is denied to make space for elite tourism and ‘trophy’ hunting.” The Maasai say their lives are at stake, as their capacity to keep livestock and provide food for their communities will be destroyed if they are evicted. “We have nowhere else to go,” they wrote. “Losing this land will mean the extinction of our community. Over 70% of our homelands has been taken for conservation and investment reasons.” The government plans to evict Maasai in the Ngorongoro conservation area, which is designated a world heritage site by Unesco, and Loliondo, near the Serengeti national park. Both are famous for luxury safari tourism. The Tanzanian government and Unesco believe Ngorongoro is overpopulated to the detriment of wildlife. The Maasai – who have led a semi-nomadic, pastoralist lifestyle for centuries, moving their cattle throughout the area as the seasons change – have for years been subjected to violent campaigns to clear areas for tourism. “My wife and children feel threatened. The whole community is concerned about what their future will be like,” said one Maasai community leader, who asked not to be named because of the potential backlash from the authorities. “The government is trying to investigate who is behind the protests. Many people are being harassed.” In February, eight UN special rapporteurs expressed their concerns about the eviction plans in Ngorongoro. About 82,000 Maasai could be removed from the area over the next five years under plans drawn up by Tanzania’s national commission for Unesco in 2019 to expand the conservation area. The Maasai already face restricted use of the land because of its Unesco listing. They are not allowed to cultivate crops, which has led to food shortages. The situation has worsened recently because of severe drought in the region. A report from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, published on Tuesday, outlined how prolonged dry spells had led to severe shortages of pasture and water for livestock in the northern Maasai region. It said more than 60,000 animals had died. Farther north in Loliondo, near the Kenyan border, 70,000 Maasai face eviction to make way for the expanding operations of Otterlo Business Corporation (OBC), a United Arab Emirates-owned hunting company. Eviction notices were issued last year but were halted when allegations of abuse and intimidation of Maasai emerged. The evictions are expected to go ahead any day. “They [the authorities] deny people access to water, electricity. They want to create an uncomfortable situation for the people,” said Denis Moses Oleshangai, a human rights lawyer and resident of Ngorongoro. “People are worried. They are concerned about the impact of the eviction and how their life will be,” said a Maasai community leader from Loliondo, who also asked not to be named. In February this year, Tanzania’s tourism minister, Damas Ndumbaro, said the Maasai did not have a claim to their homeland as all land belonged to the president. Anuradha Mittal, executive director of the Oakland Institute thinktank, said: “This is all for conservation, to create these pristine environments for tourists. The treatment of the Maasai population in Tanzania is symptomatic of a colonial approach to conservation and tourism, which neglects the recognition of indigenous rights.” A Unesco spokesperson said: “Unesco World Heritage Centre has never at any time asked for the displacement of the Maasai people. If nature conservation is an urgent need, Indigenous peoples are also part of the answer: they are key actors and rights-holders in achieving this. Unesco World Heritage Centre and the 1972 convention thus recognise the importance of Indigenous peoples and our practice is to involve everyone in finding a solution where nature wins and people win.” OBC did not respond to requests for comment.
