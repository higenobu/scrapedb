3/17/2022,"Most of Russia's military offensives in Ukraine continue to be stalled amid fierce Ukrainian resistance, but Russia's military continues to fire dozens of missiles and rockets at Ukrainian civilian and military targets every day, a senior U.S. defense official said at a briefing in Brussels on Wednesday. The U.S. estimates that Russian President Vladimir Putin has ""around 75 percent of his total military committed to the fight in Ukraine,"" the official said, clarifying later that the 75 percent figure mostly refers to ""battalion tactical groups, which is the units that he has primarily relied upon."" ""At the height of our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, we were about 29 percent committed,"" former U.S. Army Europe commander Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges noted Tuesday at the Center for European Policy Analysis think tank. ""And it was difficult to sustain that."" Britain's Ministry of Defense said Tuesday that given Putin's significant ""personnel losses"" in Ukraine, ""Russia is redeploying forces from as far afield as its Eastern Military District, Pacific Fleet, and Armenia. It is also increasingly seeking to exploit irregular sources such as private military companies, Syrian and other mercenaries."" The U.S. official said the Pentagon has seen the Russians ""deliberate and discuss the possibility of resupply to include replacement troops,"" and given the deaths, injuries, and defections they are suffering every day, ""it certainly stands to reason that they would want to be exploring options to replenish those losses."" However, ""we haven't seen any indications that anything is moving right now outside of what they have already in Ukraine,"" the official said, cautioning that ""we still assess that they have the vast amount of their combat power available to them"" in Ukraine. ""It's pretty clear that Russian generals are running out of time, ammunition, and manpower,"" CEPA's Hodges wrote. ""There is no suggestion that the Russians have big units lurking in the woods somewhere,"" and ""it's apparent that the notional 900,000 strength of the Russian military is a hollow number. "" Russia will call up another 130,000 conscripts on April 1, he added, but while ""the Ukrainian diaspora is flocking home to help the fight; Russians are not coming back home ‚Äî and indeed, many are leaving to avoid Putin's fight.""

3/17/2022,"Mikhail Fridman said he doesn't know how to live after being hit by sanctions, per Bloomberg. Fridman told Bloomberg he has an allowance of $3,300 a month and needs UK government permission to spend money. Fridman thought he had a good relationship with the West and ""couldn't be punished,"" he said. Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman said in an interview he doesn't know how to live, three weeks after coming under sanctions, Bloomberg reported. Fridman, who currently has a net worth of $10.1 billion according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, was sanctioned by the European Union on February 28 and the UK on March 15. He described the EU's sanctions ""groundless and unfair""at the time, and said he would contest them, according to Reuters. Since the invasion of Ukraine began, Fridman's wealth has dropped by $4 billion, per Bloomberg. ""I don't know how to live,"" Fridman told Bloomberg. ""I don't know. I really don't know."" Fridman, cofounder of London investment firm LetterOne and ex-board member of Russian banking company Alfa-Bank, told Bloomberg that the sanctions meant his last working UK bank card was frozen. Currently living in the UK, he has an allowance of ¬£2,500 ($3,300) per month and has to apply for a license to spend money before the British government decides how reasonable the request is, Fridman told Bloomberg. ""My problems are really nothing compared with their problems,"" he told Bloomberg, referring to Ukrainians trapped in the conflict. Fridman resigned from the board of Alfa-Bank one day after the EU sanctioned him. He also stepped down from the board of directors of LetterOne, the investment firm he cofounded. Fridman said he thought had a good relationship with the West due to his trips to Washington and an Alfa-Bank fellowship program he set up for American, British, and German citizens in 2004. ""We sincerely believed we are such good friends of the Western world that we couldn't be punished,"" he told Bloomberg. Fridman is among the many Russians targeted by Western sanctions aimed at crippling Russia's economy and punishing President Vladimir Putin for his invasion of Ukraine.

3/17/2022,"Hailey Bieber said she suffered a small stroke caused by a blood clot over the weekend. Only 10% of strokes occur in people under 50, and the risk is smaller the younger you are. People of all ages should know their risks and the signs of stroke, like numbness on one side. Hailey Bieber is 25. She's said she eats a pescatarian diet, drinks plenty of water, and avoids sugar. She does Pilates and hot yoga on top of boxing and weight training, multiple outlets have reported. But this past weekend, the model said she suffered a small stroke that landed her in the hospital. ""Although this was one of the scariest moments I've ever been through, I'm home now and doing well,"" she shared on an Instagram story. Only about 10% of strokes occur in people younger than 50, and the risk goes down the younger you are, Dr. Donald M. Lloyd-Jones, president of the American Heart Association, told Insider. But certain factors can raise your risk, and everyone should be aware of the signs so they can seek treatment as quickly as Bieber did. ""Minutes matter in terms of saving brain tissue and brain function,"" Lloyd-Jones said. Strokes occur when there's a disruption of blood flow to the brain, typically either from a clot that's traveled to the brain or from spontaneous brain bleeding. Bieber said hers was caused by a ""small clot."" How a stroke is treated depends on how big it is, where it is, and what kind it is. A clot may be treated with a clot-busting medication, removed via surgery, or passes on its own, as Bieber said hers did. A stroke caused by brain bleeding could be stopped by reversing any blood-thinning medications or by inserting a coil into the affected blood vessel, Lloyd-Jones, who's also chair of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, said. How quickly patients get treatment affects the severity and length of any complications that follow, which can include UTIs, pneumonia, paralysis, speech and swallowing difficulties, memory loss, and even personality changes and a propensity for profanity. Strokes are more common in women than men, with one in five experiencing one in their lifetime, according to the American Heart Association. Women are also more likely to die from strokes. While some factors like race and a family history of strokes you can't control, others like not smoking and managing your blood pressure you can. Estrogen-containing hormonal birth control ‚Äî especially among smokers ‚Äî can also increase the risk. If you're concerned about your risk, talk to your provider about alternative contraceptive options, Dr. Kelly Culwell, an OB-GYN in San Diego, previously told Insider. ""A lot of times,"" she said, ""women just sort of take whatever they're given."" The AHA uses the acronym FAST to raise awareness of stroke symptoms. It stands for facial drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulty, and ""time to call 911."" While some symptoms like numbness may mimic other conditions like anxiety, Lloyd-Jones said a tell-tale sign of stroke is when the symptoms only occur on one side. Still, it can be easy to dismiss symptoms of stroke when you're otherwise young and healthy, as Bieber appears to be. Jayme Kelly, a 29-year-old nurse and CrossFit enthusiast, thought her numbness was due to sleeping on her limbs wrong. But just a few hours later, she couldn't speak. At the hospital, she learned she'd suffered a stroke related to a blood-clotting disorder that had gone undiagnosed. Now, 2-1/2 years later, Kelly remains out of work and in speech therapy, occupational therapy, music therapy, and psychotherapy. She previously told Insider she wants people, and especially women, to put their health first. ""Sometimes we need to focus on ourselves more and then we can focus on everyone else,"" she said. ""And if I can have a stroke, so can all of you."" Read the original article on Insider",Health/INSIDER,"Hailey Bieber had a small stroke at age 25.

3/17/2022,"If the subject of COVID-19 were not so serious, Gov. Ron DeSantis and Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo would easily qualify as the Abbott and Costello of infectious disease policy. In other words, they are a great comedy team. While the federal Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics both recommend the vaccine for children age 5 or older, Dr. Ladapo proudly announces that Florida will become the first state to announce the opposite policy. While medical experts throughout our state, including professors at our universities, are criticizing DeSantis and Ladapo, our governor characterizes their expertise as ‚ÄúCOVID theater.‚Äù I recall a time when our state consistently elected governors that we could respect and who wouldn‚Äôt consider bullying teenagers. No more. Stephen Benedict, Lake Worth The anti-mask, anti-vaccine head of the Florida Department of Health should be sued for malpractice. 'Nuff said. Michael Paschkes, Boynton Beach Is there nobody able to get through to Florida Surgeon General, Joseph Ladapo with some more facts? The reason why there are no more epidemics of polio, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox ‚Äî diseases mostly eradicated altogether ‚Äî is because we, the older generations, were vaccinated as children. Sylvia Spier, Palm Beach The story of Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo recommending no vaccines for healthy kids begs the question: What can we look forward to next? No more teaching for children who are challenged? No health exams for the healthy? No free food lunches for kids too poor because they consume too much food? No more school exams because it will demonstrate how dumb the student nay be? How about no more appointments by our governor until he is voted out of office? That is the most logical question which makes any sense, and which we should be thinking of. Robert Langer, Palm Beach Gardens So on the day the world hits 6 million dead from COVID, Florida announces it will be the first state to urge healthy kids not to get a proven medicine created for the single purpose of keeping healthy kids healthy. Coming after our governor orders teenagers standing two feet from his unmasked face to take off their masks because they don‚Äôt work. When Gov. DeSantis and his minions are gone, how much of a relief will it be to newspapers to save cost of the ink they must squander to add a disclaimer after every false health pronouncement from Florida officials to remind us that actual medical experts say just the opposite. I am 73 and credit my past three years of unprecedented good health free from any sort of respiratory complaint to masks and shots.

3/17/2022,"About 50 miles from Ukraine at an airport in Eastern Poland, a major show of American force is designed to deter Russian aggression. The U.S. has deployed two Patriot missile batteries, which are among the most sophisticated air defense systems in the world. The weapon defeats threats by shooting them out of the sky. ""All of these missiles are designed to defeat tactical ballistic missiles, designed to defeat cruise-type missiles, as well as aircraft,"" said the battery commander, who CBS News was asked not to name for security reasons. ""Regardless of intentional or accidental, the system actually does not have the means of discriminating against those, it identifies threats and we have the ability of defeating those threats."" The systems have been at this location for about a week, he said. It's not just the U.S. deploying Patriot missiles, Germany and the Netherlands are deploying them too as the war in Ukraine moves closer to NATO's doorstep. A Russian missile hit a military facility just 15 miles from the Polish border on Sunday. Local reports say a suspected Russian drone was found in Romania last week. The airport in Eastern Poland is also used as a way station for weapons going to Ukraine. On Tuesday, what appeared to be a convoy of trucks left the airport heading for the border.
