2/13/2022,"Improvements made to Hestercombe, a grand old house in Somerset, at the end of the 19th century were many and varied – glasshouses, a church, a model dairy and a splendid cricket pitch, but one addition was a little more intimate and surprisingly modern. EWB “Teddy” Portman, the wealthy owner of the house, gifted his wife, Constance, what the modern custodians of Hestercombe claim may be the first “Jacuzzi” bath for a domestic home, possibly as a Valentine’s present.  The eight-tap spray bath is to be shown off as part of an exhibition at the estate that highlights some of the house’s more unusual artefacts. Portman ordered the installation of the bath in the 1890s and cost him about £45, the equivalent of more than £5,000 now. The bathroom overlooks the formal gardens, which were redesigned by Edwin Lutyens and Gertrude Jekyll and, for added cosiness, has an open fire. A spokesperson for the house said the bath was unusual and well preserved. “It is an eight-tap spray bath we believe was one of the first Jacuzzi baths installed into a British home by George Jennings Ltd, who was also the inventor of the first public flush toilets. We are confident it is the best preserved bath of its kind in the UK, possibly even farther afield. “Teddy Portman bought the bath for his wife and it was installed in the 1890s – a Valentine’s gift perhaps. We think we’re so advanced and different today, but these objects show that us humans haven’t changed all that much really.” The improvements made to the house and estate made a stir in the area, with the Somerset County Gazette reporting that “no fewer than 150 men” were working on the project. Hestercombe archivist Kim Legate said the bath was designed by the London firm founded by the sanitary engineer and plumber, George Jennings (1810-82). Settings include “wave”, “plunge” and “spray”. After the deaths of the Portmans, the house was used as a fire service headquarters and got a mention in the Western Daily Press in 1972, at which point the bath still worked. “No one, not even Mr. Johnson [chief fire officer], uses the bath nowadays,” the paper reported. “But it is still in perfect working order. This was proved quite recently by a visiting television reporter who got a soaking when he tried it out.” The bath will be displayed in the heritage exhibition, Things That Pass a Thousand Times: Unearthing Hestercombe’s Collections, which will also feature one of Jekyll’s trowels, from 12 March-15 May.",Arts/Culture,‘First domestic Jacuzzi’ revealed in Somerset stately home,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/13/worlds-first-domestic-jacuzzi-revealed-in-somerset-stately-home-hestercombe
2/13/2022,"Epping Forest has swaths of designated land that is home to adders, grass snakes and common lizards, as well as white admiral and purple hairstreak butterflies, and mammals such as shrews and voles that, in turn, provide food for birds of prey and owls. However, life for the forest’s bovine residents has not been so easy. Forest staff have long battled to prevent the cattle from roaming across nearby roads and dual carriageways.  Now, at last, cattle in Epping Forest know their place – thanks to satellite technology. The English Longhorn cows and calves that live on the ancient woodland were recently fitted with receivers – which look like cowbells – that can pick up GPS signals, which are then used to create virtual grazing areas for the animals. If an animal approaches the edge of its delineated area, its cowbell detects the boundary and starts to emit a sound that rises in pitch or eventually delivers a mild electric pulse as the animal tries to cross the boundary. The technology means the forest’s cattle can spend their time in carefully selected spots without the need for barbed wire or electric fences to keep them from wandering across the roads surrounding the former royal forest at the northern tip of London. The system, pioneered by the Norwegian company Nofence, has been adopted to control the herd of 66 animals that currently graze in Epping Forest and which help maintain the health of its 2,400 hectares (5,900 acres) of grass and woodland. Over the next few years, it is hoped the system will allow forest staff to increase the herd to around 150 animals. “Large grazing animals like cows help to create very variable habitats,” said John Phillips, the forest’s grazing and landscapes officer. “They crop back the grass and allow smaller plants to grow. And keeping the grass short also helps animals, including reptiles and birds to feed.” Hundreds of cows and calves once grazed on the land under ancient rights that were granted to commoners, people who lived in a forest parish and who owned at least half an acre of land. In the late 19th century, these rights came under strain as land was enclosed and housing developments spread. Protests began and the forest was eventually bought by the City of London Corporation and stripped of its designation as a royal forest. It was decreed that from then on, Epping Forest would be “unenclosed and unbuilt on as an open space for the recreation and enjoyment of the people”. (The right to collect wood in Epping Forest also survives though this is limited to “one faggot of dead or driftwood” a day per resident and is rarely exploited.) Commoners were allowed to continue grazing cattle – though their numbers fell throughout the 20th century until the BSE crisis in 1996 led to their complete removal from the forest. Recently, cattle have been brought back, triggering the need for a new solution. Fencing is not permitted in Epping Forest so at first underground cables were laid round the perimeter of grazing areas and cattle were fitted with tracking devices that gave them a mild electric shock when they tried to cross over a cable. “However, you had to dig up the cable each time you wanted to move the cattle to a new grazing area,” said Phillips. “In addition, you had to dig up the cables if they broke down or needed servicing. We needed something more flexible.” The Nofence system avoids these problems, said Phillips. Its receivers relay the exact position, determined by GPS, of each animal in the forest. That data is then transmitted to apps on the mobile phones of forest staff. Using these devices, they can then mark out the grazing area for each animal on a digital map that is stored on their phones. The animal’s cowbell detects if it is approaching the boundary of its grazing area and emits sounds before administering a mild electric pulse. “The cow learns to associate the sound’s rise in pitch with the prospect of being given an electric pulse – which is no stronger than the one it would get from an electric fence,” said Synne Foss Budal, general manager of Nofence UK. “As a result, it changes direction away from the boundary. “We can monitor very precisely what a cow is doing this way. We can see that it knows the difference between the first pitch and the last pitch of the sound emitted, and that it knows exactly when a pulse is going to come. So they time it. They turn around at the last second so they can get the most of fresh grass at the boundary edge,” she said. Crucially, these virtual grazing areas can be changed merely by altering their boundaries on a mobile phone app, said Phillips. “We can create a new virtual pasture by marking it on a phone while also creating a corridor that links their old pasture with their new one. The animals will wander down the corridor to their new grazing lands. There is no digging up of cables or knocking down fences. It is just right for Epping Forest.”",News/Environment,Satellite technology creates virtual grazing areas in Epping forest,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/13/satellite-technology-creates-virtual-grazing-areas-in-epping-forest
2/13/2022,"Songs that claim Covid-19 is fake and describe the vaccines as “poison” are being actively promoted to Spotify users in playlists generated by its content recommendation engine. Tracks found on the world’s largest music streaming service explicitly encourage people not to get vaccinated and say those who do are “slaves”, “sheep”, and victims of Satan. Others call for an uprising, urging listeners to “fight for your life”.  “They fooled the whole world with PCR testing. The thought police are patrolling. Can’t you see what’s unfolding?” say the lyrics of another, adding: “The whole thing ends once the people have risen.” Spotify this weekend removed several of the songs flagged to it by the Observer, which it said breached rules banning content that promotes “dangerous, false, or deceptive content about Covid-19” that may pose a threat to public health. Before being removed, the songs could be easily found using keywords through Spotify’s search tool. But they were also actively promoted to users who express interest in similar songs via automatically generated playlists, potentially bringing them to a far wider audience. One user who played a song containing anti-vaccine lyrics was given a personalised playlist directing them to even more extreme songsOf the 50 songs in that playlist, 19 included explicit references to anti-vaccine and Covid misinformation, including claims the vaccine is being used to microchip people. Some had references to other conspiracy theories, including claims that satanic paedophiles run the world, and that the Sandy Hook school shooting in the US, which left 26 dead, was a hoax. Among the artists whose content was recommended to users was Edward Freeman, a rapper known as Remeece, who made headlines in the UK after touring schools blasting his anti-vaccine anthem Don’t Tek Di Vaccine to pupils outside school gates. The lyrics of the song – among those that remained live on Spotify last week – repeatedly say “don’t tek the damn thing” and “you mad”, and describe the vaccine as “poison”. Remeece has visited primary and secondary schools in London, Cornwall and Bournemouth, according to videos posted on his Instagram feed. In December, he was filmed performing the song at a protest with Piers Corbyn, a key figure in the UK’s anti-vaccine movement. Spotify has long been aware it is hosting the rapper’s content – which was first reported to Spotify by a concerned parent in November, according to emails seen by the Observer. His material remained live without any content warning last week. The findings have stoked debate about the streaming giant’s handling of misinformation, with critics calling for the platform – and other streaming services hosting similar material – to be held to the same standard as traditional social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. Spotify, which has more than 180 million users, has recently faced criticism over its relationship with podcaster Joe Rogan, who it signed in an exclusive deal for a reported $100m. Several artists including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell demanded their content be removed from Spotify in protest at Rogan’s alleged role in spreading misinformation about Covid-19, and 270 US doctors, scientists, healthcare professionals and professors wrote to the platform calling Rogan “a menace to public health” for airing anti-vaccine ideology. Guests on his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, have included Robert Malone, a controversial infectious-disease researcher who was involved in the development of mRNA vaccine technology but has been criticised for spreading vaccine misinformation. In response to that criticism, Spotify deleted several episodes and published new rules telling those uploading content to avoid claiming Covid-19 is a hoax and spreading anti-vaccine misinformation. It also said it would add content advisories to podcast episodes discussing Covid-19. However, the anti-vaccine songs, which contain lyrics in some cases far more extreme than those podcasts, did not carry a content warning. In some cases the algorithm directed listeners to content with low numbers of plays, potentially amplifying the reach of misinformation that would otherwise have had a small audience. Many of the songs had titles containing keywords such as “vaccine” and “mask”, suggesting it would be easy for Spotify to locate them if it wanted to. Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a group that monitors misinformation and harmful content online, said the material identified contained “unscientific, provably false misinformation” that encourages listeners to refuse vaccines that could save lives. He said: “Spotify isn’t just hosting and profiting from dangerous misinformation, its algorithm is proactively connecting disparate pieces of dangerous misinformation and packaging it up to listeners.After the Joe Rogan controversy, much was made of Spotify’s supposed tough stance against Covid misinformation. It appears the opposite is true.” Spotify has previously removed other types of harmful content from its platform that was deemed to breach its policies. In December, following an investigation by Sky News, it removed almost 150 hours of content it said violated its hateful content policy, including antisemitic, racist and white supremacist material found in podcasts. In 2020, a BBC investigation led Spotify and other platforms including Apple Music, YouTube Music and Deezer to remove racist, antisemitic and homophobic content. An excerpt of a Hitler speech, calls for “Aryans” to make a brand new start, and references to white power were found in songs hosted by the streaming services. Don’t Tek Di Vaccine was among the songs Spotify took down this weekend. It is yet to say if it plans to add health warnings to songs which discuss Covid-19, as it has with podcasts. A spokesperson said: “Spotify prohibits content on the platform which promotes dangerous false, or dangerous deceptive content about Covid-19 that may cause offline harm and/or pose a direct threat to public health. When content that violates this standard is identified, the appropriate enforcement action is taken.”",News/Technology,‘Don’t take the damn thing’: how Spotify playlists push dangerous anti-vaccine tunes,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/13/dont-take-the-damn-thing-how-spotify-playlists-push-dangerous-anti-vaccine-tunes
2/13/2022,"Fraudsters who engage in romance scams are becoming increasingly brazen about how they operate and are willing to spend five months building up a relationship with their victims, according to a security expert. In some cases, criminals will even have video calls with victims, luring them into a false sense of security that they are involved with someone who is genuinely interested in them.  The number of romance scams, where people hand over money to someone they believe they are in a relationship with, doubled during the pandemic with the average victim losing £6,100, according to figures from TSB. Women are twice as likely to be victims as men. Jake Moore, a cyber-security adviser at internet security firm ESET, says fraudsters can spend four to five months in establishing a fake relationship before carrying out the crime. During this time, they will often be working on several victims. “They’re very good at remembering all the stories that lead along that journey [ending in] an elaborate scam as to why they want the money,” he says. These scams can be as simple as a person claiming their car has broken down on the way to visit and that they need money to repair it, he explains. In another instance reported by TSB, a “soldier” claimed he needed funds to get home from a foreign posting. Victims, who TSB says are an average age of 47, have been increasingly targeted through social media and dating apps. There have been warnings to consumers to beware of scams before Valentine’s Day . Many scammers used restrictions on movement during the pandemic as an excuse not to meet up with victims. Refusing to meet in real-life, or face to face for a video call, are both things that should ring alarm bells. However, Moore says that criminals are now taking more risks and making face-to-face video calls where they are fully visible. “There are male and female fraudsters who put in video calls every night, really creating this perfect story as to how this relationship unfolds.” He advises daters to change the times of the calls and to be spontaneous about when they happen, as this could upset a fraudster’s timetable. “If they are controlling and saying ‘it’s got to be this time’ then that could be a red flag,” he says. Katherine Hart from the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, which represents trading standards officers, says the pandemic increased people’s reliance on indirect communications through phones. “There’s the thinking that they’re protected by a computer screen to a certain extent, and will easily, and quite readily, pass on a lot of personal information via text or emails,” she says. “Unfortunately, quite often we only find out about these things when somebody has actually intervened, whether that be a bank or a family member, or the victim has caused themselves such mental anguish there is a referral from social services.” In some instances, criminals will scan the death announcements and target lonely widowers in the following months with the promise of companionship, she says. Action Fraud reported instances of romance fraud were up 40% in the year to April last year with almost £74m being lost.",Lifestyle/Money,Pandemic helps heartless romance fraudsters infect the internet,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/13/pandemic-helps-heartless-romance-fraudsters-infect-the-internet

Marou 48% milk, £6.95/60g, is from Cocoa Runners. The cocoa is from Vietnam and the milk is from grass-fed cows and, I swear, you can tell. God this was so good. My restraint was sorely tested once I’d flicked the foil open. (‘Where’s that yummy milk gone, Mamma?’ my children asked as I slid it under my diary.) With its creamy, almost meaty mouthfeel, you can kid yourself it’s OK, because it’s a dark milk. Thoroughly enjoyable.  If you fancy something a little darker, but want some inclusions, and who doesn’t, then Karuna’s 62% Hazelnut and Dark cashew Nougat, £7.95/60g with cocoa from Mexico, is absolutely wonderful (also from Cocoa Runners). It doesn’t taste madly nougat-y, so don’t let that put you off if nougat is not your thing. But if it is, then don’t expect chewy nougat bits, think more nutty bits. It’s organic, fair paid, bean to bar, it’s got it all going on. For something darker, but a bit more exciting than a regular non-inclusion bar try Cocoa Retreat’s Whisky Nibs, £6.25 /45g. It’s 70% single origin Ecuadorian chocolate with cocoa nibs that have been soaked in 10-year-old single malt Glenmorangie whisky, which you can taste.

2/13/2022,"Extortionate energy bills that land on the nation’s doormats this spring may not be solely due to soaring gas prices. Customer service blunders have left some households facing erroneous demands for hundreds of pounds and threats of bailiffs if they contest them. Last year, 40% of energy complaints made to Citizens Advice concerned inaccurate billing, it says. According to the charity, companies are “failing in their most basic obligation to customers”.  Inadequate IT systems, faulty meters and mismatched accounts are to blame for thousands of inaccurate charges at a time when gas and electricity bills are set to rise by 51%, following the price cap review in April. One Cash reader, Ali Shearer, was stunned to open a final demand of £1,000 from Scottish Power. He’d received no previous bills from the company because he had never been a Scottish Power customer. “It started with a man arriving at the door to read the meter,” he says. “He told me he had the wrong meter number for the house and that he’d deal with it. Unbeknownst to me, he was from Scottish Power, not SSE, which has supplied my energy since 2010.” Shearer’s numerous attempts to convince Scottish Power that he was not a customer were ineffective. Over the next nine months, he received letters and a visit from two debt collection companies. Last month two bills for £1,700 and £1,729 arrived in the same week, addressed to “Owner/Occupier”. Only after the Observer contacted Scottish Power did the firm discover that Shearer was being billed for the electricity consumption of a nearby water pumping station. “We should not have pursued him for this debt. We have apologised and agreed a gesture of goodwill,” it says. Scottish Power customers Douglas and Karen Wilson were perplexed when the monthly direct debit for their one-bedroom flat was raised by 20% to £171 in late 2020. They checked their online electricity account, which said they were £800 in credit. When they applied for a refund they were told they actually owed £1,200. “A monthly direct debit of £82 was agreed until the anomaly was resolved,” says Douglas. “The resolution was to be an official meter reading, but the pandemic precluded a site visit, so the problem was kicked down the road.” Four months later, Scottish Power increased the direct debit to £233 without warning. It closed the Wilsons’ complaint without notifying them, and passed their account to a debt collection agency. Last month, the agency demanded an immediate payment of £930. “The letter from the debt collectors threatened action unless we paid by the day before the letter reached us,” says Douglas. “I attempted to contact Scottish Power but couldn’t get through on the helpline. They take up to five days to respond to emails and we’re worried about sheriff officers turning up at the door and demanding access with menace.” An investigation by the Observer exposed years of error on the part of Scottish Power. The company admitted that the Wilsons’ electricity meter had packed up in 2017 and failed to record consumption for 18 months. Oblivious to the cause, Scottish Power assumed the couple’s energy use had plummeted to near zero and refunded the £1,600 they’d paid for the period. The meter was replaced in 2019 and a blunder meant that the day readings were transposed with cheaper night ones so the Wilsons continued to be undercharged. The shock bills were a belated attempt to make up the shortfall. Scottish Power says: “We’re sorry for the meter issues Mr Wilson has faced over the past few years and the customer service he has received trying to get this resolved. “The amount he was paying was not reflective of his actual usage which resulted in a debt accruing on his account. However, we should not have deadlocked his account whilst we were investigating these issues. In recognition of the time it has taken us to resolve the issues we have withdrawn £532 from Mr Wilson’s outstanding balance.” Scottish Power was fined £18m in 2016 after the energy regulator Ofgem identified serious failings with its customer service and its billing system. According to complaints received by the Observer and reviews on Trustpilot, errors persist. Ovo customers have also endured years of inaccurate bills after being subsumed by the energy giant SSE. In 2020 the company agreed to pay £8.9m into a redress fund after Ofgem ruled that it had prioritised business expansion over customer service. It promised to ensure the mistakes were not repeated. However, last month it informed blind 81-year-old customer John McKenna that his electricity account was £993 in arrears, having increased his monthly direct debit from £14 to £236 without warning. The customer’s bills had been based on estimated readings for seven years, despite visits by agents to read the meter, and his requests for an accurate bill had gone unheeded. Ovo discovered last October that his meter had stopped recording his electricity consumption back in 2014 and so he’d only been billed for standing charges since then. As energy customers are not allowed to charge customers for unbilled energy dating back more than 12 months, the £993 was Ovo’s guesstimate of the previous year’s costs. Ovo admitted a series of errors when the Observer intervened and agreed to waive the £933 arrears as a goodwill gesture. Complaints website Resolver says energy complaints rose 21% last month and a third were from vulnerable customers. “When people are concerned about making ends meet, they tend to scrutinise their bills closely,” says Resolver’s Martyn James. “Massive bills, over short periods, that can’t possibly be right is a strong trend – as are complaints about how they are being investigated.” Ofgem says: “Protecting customers is our top priority and we regularly engage with all domestic suppliers to ensure they are treating customers fairly and providing reasonable customer service.”",Lifestyle/Money,Service blunders pile on the agony for UK customers as energy bills rocket,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/13/service-blunders-pile-on-the-agony-for-uk-customers-as-energy-bills-rocket
2/13/2022,"It was an extraordinary way to end nearly two years of restrictions and lockdowns. With no explanatory briefings from either the chief medical officer or chief scientific adviser, no input from Sage and no consultation with Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the prime minister told a surprised House of Commons he would unilaterally lift all Covid restrictions a month ahead of time on 24 February. How public health could be sustained thereafter was plainly an afterthought, of little consequence to be unveiled after the recess in a document pointedly called Living with Covid. Nobody expects other than the scantest of strategies, with even the Office for National Statistics’s (ONS) highly regarded surveillance survey, which allows the UK to pick up the emergence of high-risk variants, likely to be scaled back or even scrapped after April.  Any continuing requirement to self-isolate? Wear masks? Any social distancing? Working from home? Covid passports? All over. Even, it seems under Treasury pressure, free PCR testing is to be stopped for all but the most at risk. With a confidence born of Omicron proving to be much less dangerous than feared in December (helped perhaps by Britons behaving in a guarded way), the gamble not to lock down has been validated; Britain is to be the “first in the world” to be free of restrictions. But this was not a decision driven by public health considerations; it was rather buying the prime minister crucial political support. Allow me to let you in on a dream I have. I’m living in a country in which, after months of sacrifice, hardship and dislocation, the leaders are pulling the country together to create a new normal. Flanked by experts and supported by the encouraging data that hospital admissions are falling, with death rates falling even further for the vaccinated, we are told that, after consultation with the three nations and the leaders of the opposition parties, the entire country is going to enjoy an immediate, phased, watchful relaxation of restrictions as fast as possible. Of course, surveillance through surveys would continue as we guard against new dangerous variants and, to make it worthwhile, testing would not be scrapped but become more sparing so that those with symptoms could know whether they had Covid. The expectation would remain that people with Covid would legitimately stay at home rather than infect others, while nightclubs and sporting venues could and should ask for proof of vaccination. Masks would continue to be worn on public transport. In this imagined country, we had come through the pandemic together and, while the new normal could never be the normal of pre-pandemic, it was still normal enough. Recognising that Covid is global, we would be actively mobilising our now surplus public health capacity to help others. This dream is where the vast majority would love us to be. Personally, I delight in the escalating return to normality – dinners, lunches with colleagues, getting out and about much more freely – but I am watchful. On buses, trains and tubes, I take care to wear a mask and make sure, if I can, that I sit with others wearing them. I willingly wear a mask in shops, cinema, theatre or going around galleries. I keep my social distance. I enjoy the possibilities of Zoom, a working life organised around online slots, but saving time on travelling. If asked to take a lateral flow test before a large gathering, I happily comply. I live a life as normally as possible – but remain vigilant about the danger of contracting Covid. It’s how I expect to continue. Instead, Living with Covid will be an enforced imposition of a particular conception of liberty by the dominant faction of a discredited party – a fundamental misreading of public opinion and the dynamics of pandemic management. I am like the vast majority. The modellers who warned about the potential explosive impact of Omicron were not exponents of big state socialism. Rather, they were surprised and their models caught out by the degree to which the majority of us constrained our own liberty, were watchful about contact and social interaction, partly as a result of the models’ alarming projected scenarios, and lived by the rules. It was our new behaviour, as much as state rules, which drove the better-than-expected outcome. We were, in philosopher Isaiah Berlin’s famous formulation, practitioners of positive liberty – taking control of our individual destinies through acting together. By contrast, Tory libertarians are really Big Brother imposers of Berlin’s negative liberty, defining liberty not in terms of individuals trying to control their life in concert with others but wholly in terms of removing what they describe as coercive state restrictions and obstacles. Concerns about coercion might make arguable sense in some second-order walks of economic and social life – objecting, say, to councils’ over-zealous imposition of swingeing parking fines – but in public health issues negative liberty is bonkers. Big Brother removal of safeguards to my good health in the name of individual liberty so that I am free to be made seriously ill by others is as dangerous as any socialist Big Brother. As I have argued in an earlier column, the good society fuses the claims of the “we” with the needs of the “I”. Be sure Living with Covid, informed by the bossy negative libertarians of the Tory Covid Recovery Group, will neglect the “we” almost entirely. Nor is any of this made easier by chancellor Rishi Sunak’s obsession with Treasury orthodoxy. The purpose of the state is the creation of public goods for which we readily pay – of which the Office for National Statistics surveys of the incidence of Covid and testing are prime examples. This short-sighted, mad-dash exit from the pandemic mirrors its beginning – a painful refusal to accept that human beings benefit from the group acting together, especially in matters of public health.

He was awarded the Deutsche Börse photography prize in 2009 and in 2011 the Paris Photo prize for the most significant photobook of the past 15 years with A Shimmer of Possibility The woman in the photograph is Senami, my partner of 18 years. It was taken in a very basic room during a trip around New Zealand’s South Island in 2012. We were staying in a travel hostel called Shambhala, a lovely place on the northern coast. I always wake up early; Senami… doesn’t. We are very different, Senami and I, but have found a way to make it work, and we have a lovely son together now. As Harold Brodkey put it: “People are somewhat gorgeous collections of chemical fires, aren’t they?” I chose this photograph because I like the simplicity of it. You don’t need adornment and embellishments to express love, despite what Hallmark says. When you take images of others, it is vital to take that Buddhist approach of projecting love towards everyone, no matter who, no matter where. KF Walter holding newborn Bruno, 2014 Born in Birmingham, Richard Billingham is best known for his award-winning photobook Ray’s a Laugh (1996) and the 2018 film Ray & Liz, both documenting the chaotic lives of his parents in the Black Country. He lives in Wales with his wife and three children and holds professorships in photography at Gloucestershire and Middlesex universities This photograph was taken seven years ago. My wife had our third child, and when the baby came back with the other two kids from the hospital, I wanted to make a photograph that captured the positive energy you get when you bring a newborn into the house. I knew from having the other two that the energy is there for the first few days, and then it dissipates. Everyone’s happy and blissful, but it doesn’t last. It’s like a honeymoon period. You can never get back to it. In the photograph, Walter would be eight, Ramona six or thereabouts, and the baby is probably just a day old. It still has blood on it. It wouldn’t have had a bath. Whereas the older two have had showers and it looks like they’re ready for bed. Walter’s got a bare chest and he’s got the baby on it skin-to-skin. I was trying to make a photograph that captured the three of them together for the first time. Since then, screens have come in – phones and iPads. That picture was taken just before there were any screens in the house apart from a TV. Now [the three kids] are more atomised. I’ve got five brothers, but, except for one of them, I haven’t seen them for many years. So I don’t recognise the sibling dynamic here. I guess a lot of the photographs I’ve done in the past, with my family in them, haven’t been as positive. Does love come up a lot in my work? Empathy, maybe. And even when I photograph in quite grim surroundings, I’m looking for composition, beauty and harmony within that. When I took all those photographs of my parents many years ago, the camera brought us together more. If I hadn’t had the camera, I wouldn’t have gone around to see them as much and taken all those pictures. A camera enables you to get closer. There can be an expression of love in the taking of the photograph. In this photo, it’s in the arrangement, the way I’ve positioned the camera, the way I’ve got the three kids together within the frame, the way I’ve positioned myself in relation to them. I’ve got down on to their level, I’m not standing up with a phone looking down on them. It’s like you’re in their world with them, and I like that.

She won the Prix de Rome in 2007 and in 2013 exhibited at the Venice Biennale I love how this work symbolises the ever-lasting longing to fully merge with another; how two become one. It’s a romantic myth that somehow kept lingering in my subconscious ever since I was a young girl. My heart yearned for such a collision of two bodies and souls; to truly melt together with one’s lover. To never be alone. Now I’m older and wiser and know there’s no such thing, at least nothing definite. Maybe in alchemy, art and death there might be answers and solutions, but not in our daily lives. This image shows a man and woman in stone, sharing body parts – it reminds me of Pompeii, lovers who died in each other’s arms. Classical sculptures that slowly crumble in time, erosion of their bodies, symbols of decay. But where their bodies meet, there’s an eruption of colour, as if to say: we’re alive, fluid, we’re dancing. I like to think of this as two people making love, an orgasm frozen in time and space, and hope for them they’ll enjoy it for ever. The Dance, Manchester, 1958 Born in Salford, Neil Libbert is a​ ​photojournalist who has worked for the Observer, the Guardian, the New York Times and many other publications since the 1950s,​ with specialisms in street photography and the performing arts. In 1999 he won Nikon news photographer of the year and a World Press Photo award for his coverage of the bombings in the Admiral Duncan pub, SohoI was 20 years old when I took this, living in digs in Manchester, a few years after finishing at art school, taking photographs for the Manchester Guardian and local papers. I can’t remember being commissioned to do it, or where the club was – it’s such a long time ago. I was single, but I certainly wasn’t there for the dancing. I’d have just been there with my camera, to try to capture moments between people. This picture doesn’t reveal much about the people involved, and I like that. Nobody can recognise themselves years later and be upset about it. But even though you can’t see their faces, there’s a tenderness in the image that everyone can understand. I read recently that Picasso said that inside every photographer is an artist trying to get out, which made me laugh. There’s some truth in that. I think this photograph has a little feeling of a painting, with me trying to capture a spontaneous moment. It’s a bit of a fantasy, really, and it helps that back then I always shot in black and white. Can a photo be an expression of love? Yes, I think it can, especially in photos that aren’t staged or set up, as they feel trivial – those aren’t my scene. Even after all these years, I don’t stop seeing little moments of connection or taking photographs of them. I can’t stop it, actually. I love it. Taking a photo is still such a form of pleasure. JR Andre Hugo, Nature’s Valley, South Africa, 2020 An internationally renowned photographer specialising in portraiture, Pieter Hugo made his name with his 2008 photobook The Hyena and Other Men, and has since been shortlisted for the Deutsche Börse Photography prize and the Prix Pictet. Born in Johannesburg, he lives in Cape Town with his wife and two children There’s something inherent in love that it comes at such a great cost. Love keeps you awake at night. It comes with loneliness and discouragement. With kids, it’s a different kind of love from what I’ve experienced before. I guess it’s a more unconditional love, and with that comes a whole bunch of things that you have to accept. The nature of this thing that you love is changing, becoming sentient, evolving. And even when you desperately love someone, you also have to be able to give them space, give them distance, let them grow by themselves. You can’t smother them. This is my son after he’d had an accident during lockdown in South Africa. He was six. We had a strict, long lockdown, then we were on the red list for a very long time, so I couldn’t travel for work. Financially, it was unbearable, but I got to spend so much time with my kids that I wouldn’t normally have had. I started taking photos of my family and spoke to them about it. It became a collaborative thing. We are lucky to have a house in the countryside, so we spent a lot of time in nature and in the ocean, letting the kids roam free. You can see another scar on the photo too : that’s from a chafe from my son’s wetsuit. There’s also something allegorical about the photo, to me: we’re all scarred. And love hurts! It’s a cliche, but it’s true. JR Soho, London, November 2018 A Scottish photographer based in London, Niall McDiarmid has spent much of his career roving around Britain documenting its people and landscapes. His books include Crossing Paths, Town to Town and, most recently, Breakfast This shot, from a series I’m working on called Nightfalls, was taken in the early evening, about half past four, just off Old Compton Street in Soho. I don’t know anything about the couple but I’m guessing, from what he’s wearing, that the two of them work in restaurants. I get feelings of melancholy and a certain sense of desperation from them. The restaurant trade is hard, and they may be far from home. He’s feeling a bit down and she’s moving in to him and saying it’ll be OK, I’m there for you, we can get through this. The city is big, the night ahead will be tough, but we can do this together. There is love in this picture. There’s also the fairly surreal element of the dodo looking on, or maybe giving a bit of encouragement. Though perhaps it’s not the best creature to have rooting for you. Don’t end up like the dodo! Get together and reproduce, or we’ll all be gone! I wouldn’t necessarily say I’m a street photographer, but street photography has a rich tradition of trying to capture aspects of love. The idea of showing affection has always been part of the genre. Who could resist a picture of people kissing on the street? It provides an element of hope, and if done in the right way, it’s engaging, people are drawn to it. You do have to be a bit sensitive, because people are being intimate and hopefully you’re not capturing something illicit or wrong, but I think love is an important thing to capture, in any kind of photography. KF Canal Road, from the series Nalini, 2017 An artist based in Eastbourne, Arpita Shah has lived in India, Ireland, Saudi Arabia and Scotland and her work explores the intersections of culture, identity and heritage. Her practice involves photography, film and found objects, and she has exhibited internationally This is Canal Road, from a long-term project of mine called Nalini, named after my grandmother, whose name means “lotus flower” in Sanskrit. It looks around my maternal lineage, at our stories of migration, love and loss. This passport belonged to my great-grandmother, Narmada, who ran a dairy farm in Nairobi in the 1920s and 1930s before returning to India during the second world war, which took 27 days by sea. In 2017, I travelled to Kenya with my mum for the first time, as a way to connect with my family’s past. Growing up, I’d heard so many stories about it from my grandmother, who was young when they left: it was like a family myth. I knew that Narmada was a very resilient, petite woman, 5ft tall with 14 children, hands-on with farming and running the business. But when my mother and I got to Nairobi, Canal Road, where my family’s home used to be, didn’t exist any more: the road names changed after Kenya gained independence. I tried to find old maps, then, by luck, my mum chatted to a shop owner who knew someone who knew someone… and we were fortunate enough to be taken to the exact spot where it used to be. That’s where I picked the pink flower. When my grandmother used to talk about her childhood, she talked about the vivid, pink flowers that grew there. Flowers are a sacred offering in Hinduism, which is the cultural background of my family, so by collecting objects and making still lifes, I’m making shrine-like images imbued with stories that bring us together in love. JR Untitled #8, from the series Languor, 2020 Born in 1994, Donavon Smallwood grew up in Harlem, not far from Central Park. A self-taught photographer, last year he published his first monograph, Languor, and won the Aperture portfolio prize and the Daylight photo award This picture was taken in Central Park in summer 2020. I was mostly at home alone that year because of the pandemic. Being with yourself instead of with a partner, everything sticks out as an image of love, of what you don’t have. I was walking through a part of the park that you’re not supposed to go through and I saw a bunch of spider webs, including this one. I was like, of course I see a heart – it just keeps coming up! I spent 30 minutes trying to get photographs of it – I had to wait for the light to shine through at a specific angle so that you could see the whole web. The wonkiness of the heart was really interesting. People always ask, did you Photoshop that? No, that’s literally how it was. The fragility of the heart said something to me about the fragility of love – of loving without getting love in return. And a spider web is used as a luring device to capture prey. There’s so much meaning there. Ideas of love come up a lot in my work, but it might not always be obvious. Recently I’ve been taking portraits of people I’ve just met, and I found those experiences to be really intimate and even loving, even if they only last 10 minutes. When people are wary about being photographed and then become at ease with it, it reminds me of the transition from winter to summer and the idea of rosebuds growing from underneath the snow. Everything looks like it’s dead, but underground everything is working hard. KF Toni & Jamie, 2020 Born in 1991 and based in London, Sophie Green is a documentary photographer who celebrates British culture and its idiosyncrasies, with a particular focus on under-represented communities and subcultures When lockdown relaxed in summer 2020, huge crowds of people from all classes, races and religions headed to the beach. I started going to seaside towns around the UK to take portraits, and I met Toni and Jamie outside the arcades at New Brighton beach in Merseyside. I’ve always found arcades exciting social spaces, with mad interiors and machines ramped up to full volume… there’s huge energy. When I met Toni and Jamie there was something quite intense about their faces, their eyes. I immediately wanted to make their picture. It was clear they were a couple. I asked their permission to photograph them, and they were really up for it. It felt necessary, in order to convey their status as a couple, that Toni and Jamie should be in some kind of embrace or loving posture. They had been in a similar position when I found them, so this was inspired by what I saw. I love Jamie’s protective position over Toni, wrapping his arms around her. It’s a very sweet gesture. I’m not sure how long they’ve been dating, but there’s something quite romantic and innocent about their body language. I always think of young love being so innocent. We imagine we’ll be with that person for ever, but in most cases the relationship will fail. There are so many challenges to overcome in any kind of relationship, but particularly when you’re young and there’s so much evolving and learning to do. A lot of my work follows different subcultures and communities who are drawn together by a way of life or shared identity, and I’m always looking for positive stories. Our world is incredibly negative, so it’s wonderful and necessary to find instances where people merge and find common ground. KF INDIA. Delhi. A Valentines day love cake, 2009 A chronicler of modern, everyday life in Britain and abroad for the past 50 years, Bristol-based Martin Parr is internationally renowned for his anarchic and brightly coloured photojournalism exploring subjects such as class and tourism. His major projects include The Last Resort and Common Sense I’ve been to India two or three times and often been there in February. During the run-up to Valentine’s Day, I discovered they make a lot of cakes. I wasn’t expecting to find this surfeit of them, but I couldn’t resist photographing them. They were bright, colourful and kitsch: everything I like about a good image, and a good cake. So over the years, I’ve made a point of photographing them with my closeup lens and lens flash. This one was in Delhi – a lot of them were in Delhi. I’d make it my business to go round some of the bakers and get some shots on the 13th: I’d have to get permission, then pull the cake from behind the counter, so it was a bit of a faff, but most shopkeepers were good. We’d have a little chat in English, but the bakers didn’t tell me why they made them. Supply and demand, I suppose… as simple as that. I don’t know why we don’t see more cakes like this made in the UK, because I’m sure they’d sell. I send a Valentine’s card every year – I’m very happily married – but I’ve never bought a cake, because I haven’t found one. I could make one myself, yes, but sadly I’m not the cake-making type.

2/13/2022,"Plugged by Nas, sampled by Rita Ora, Nigerian-born, Hamburg-based Nneka makes music that ranges across genres, a versatility that chimes with her own internationalist backstory: she’s also a visual artist with an anthropology-archaeology degree. Her fourth album, released on her own label, takes in African-inflected reggae resonant with electronics (Yahweh, Maya), dissonant soul (About Guilt) and the stark, trip hop-like Afrobeat of the title track. Made in lockdown, independent of her previous labels, Nneka has been keen to join the dots between the contemporary Nigerian pop takeover and her own predilection for spacious, bass-y production. The silver thread throughout these songs is Nneka’s deceptively featherlight voice, one that tends towards sweetness and serenity but can pivot towards a sharp righteousness. The politically charged Afrobeat-rap of Yansh is both playful and furious. Then there’s the grace of her songs that ponder deceit and healing. There are bangers here that deserve a wider audience. The dubby love song Tea? finds Nneka reconnecting with a former lover, checking on whether he has done as much work on himself as she has – gently, but pointedly.

2/13/2022,"One of the most serious impacts of cancer is the sudden loss of weight, appetite, and muscle that can hit some patients in the later stages of the disease. This wasting syndrome is known as cachexia and it can be triggered in other serious conditions, including heart disease and HIV. In addition, an inherited version of extreme wasting syndromes can affect children. Known as Cockayne syndrome, it causes them to suffer severe malnutrition and wasting that parallels the effect of cachexia.  “In the case of patients with cancer, individuals can go from seeming quite normal to being wheelchair-bound due to muscle wasting and weight loss in only a matter of a few months,” said oncologist Professor Charlie Swanton, of the Crick Institute in London. “It’s quite frightening.” Despite considerable scientific effort, cachexia’s causes have remained a mystery. However, recent work by UK researchers has raised hopes that scientists are closing in on some of the causes of this affliction. A team of scientists led by Professor Ketan Patel, director of the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine in Oxford, has recently linked the disease to DNA damage that disrupts chemical messengers that are sent to the brain, causing it to release appetite-suppressing hormones. The result is severe weight loss. The researchers found that this process is often initiated when the naturally occurring chemical formaldehyde builds up in a person’s blood stream. When this is filtered by the kidneys, their cells suffer DNA damage in the process. This, in turn, causes their kidneys to secrete a hormone which messages the brain to suppress appetite. “When you have chemotherapy, you are given a chemical substance that attacks DNA in much the same way as formaldehyde does,” said Patel. “In other words, it may be damaging DNA and triggering these signals that tell the brain to suppress appetite.” The research also suggests a possible avenue for treating the problem, he added. The messenger sent out by the kidney to the brain is a chemical called GDF15, a discovery that holds important clinical implications. “It suggests we may be able to treat weight loss in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy and in children with Cockayne syndrome by administrating an antibody which neutralises GDF15. We might then be able to block these messages and halt the onset of their cachexia.” However, Swanton counselled caution. “This is a fascinating and important study. GDF15 is one known mechanism that contributes to the development of cachexia but it is not going to be the only one. We need more work like this to understand other routes and causes as a matter of urgency as we know this syndrome contributes to our inability to treat patients as they become weaker.” Progress in genomics and in understanding the causes of cachexia has led the disease to becoming a focus for the Grand Cancer Challenges programme recently established by Cancer Research UK and the US National Cancer Institute. This pinpoints the condition as a prime target for tumour research on both sides of the Atlantic. “Cachexia is more than losing your appetite and weight loss, and doctors struggle to reverse this condition when it takes hold,” added Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of Cancer Research UK. “It is a complex problem that has an enormous impact on people with cancer, damaging their wellbeing and lowering their energy at a time when they need it most. “Research that can tell us more about the mechanisms behind cachexia is essential if we want to find a way to manage it.”",News/Science,How DNA link could unlock mystery of cancer patients ‘wasting away’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/13/dna-link-mystery-of-cancer-patients-wasting-away-cachexia-cockayne-syndrome
2/13/2022,"Does music taste reflect personality? A study from the University of Cambridge involving 350,000 participants, from 50 countries, across six continents, posits that people with similar traits across the globe are drawn to similar music genres. So, “extroverts” love Ed Sheeran, Beyoncé and Justin Timberlake. The “open” thrill to Daft Punk, Radiohead and Jimi Hendrix. The “agreeable” are into Marvin Gaye, U2 and Taylor Swift. The “neurotic” enjoy, presumably as much they can, the work of David Bowie, Nirvana, and the Killers. And so on. While the study doesn’t claim to be definitive, how strange to be allotted only one personality trait/genre each. It sounds like Colour Me Beautiful for music. “What sound best goes with my personality? Did you bring along swatches?” Certainly, back when I worked for the New Musical Express, journalists, musicians and readers alike resisted being wrangled into such rigid categories.  Most half-serious music fans would consider their tastes eclectic. Which seems more feasible than a distinct personality type exclusively cleaving to one genre, and this being faithfully replicated across the globe. The idea of, say, an English person, an Argentinian and a South African, separately thinking: “I feel alienated. I will signal that by performatively listening to Nirvana’s Nevermind. For ever!” To me, this is not how people are. This is not how music works. Music taste, like the humans who possess it, seems built from a dizzying array of variables. What is your age, sex, background? Growing up, what was the dominant culture, and did you subscribe to it? Were/are you rebellious? Political? Apolitical? Withdrawn? Hedonistic? A loner? Do you feel more “yourself” in the real world, or online? When you select a song, are you happy, miserable, in love, heartbroken, angry? Or none of the above – just trying to chill while you make dinner, thanks. That’s pertinent, actually: where you are when you listen to music, what you’re doing. Working out. Driving. Strolling. Reading. Work. Leisure. In a pub or at a club. Lying in a darkened room, with AirPods in. This is a key difficulty with personality-typing music: at any one time, listening can be affected by a plethora of variants, including location, situation, activity, outside forces, memory, mood, need, whim. While taste can overlap with cultural tribalism (the spurious notion of Good/Bad taste; the need to belong), this is mainly a youthful tic and it will pass. What’s left is the individual, the ceaselessly mercurial personality, which can feel many different things within the space of a day. Which isn’t always drawn to the same style of songs. Which doesn’t always want to be the same person. The chatterbox might want to disappear into the mists with Leonard Cohen. The depressive to boogie with Ariana Grande. The introvert to headbang to Megadeth. Music can reflect your nature, but it can also take you out of yourself. It is an escape chute, a liberator, as much as it is a mirror. Some people don’t even like music. They don’t yearn for a soundtrack to their life. They just want neutral background noise that used to be termed “coffee table music”. For the rest of us, it continues to be an era of engorged culture and musical plenty. Over the years, popular music has become akin to a vast junk food menu: tasty but confusing. What do you want to listen to? Pop. Rock. Disco. Hip-hop. Punk. Grime. Goth. House. Reggae. Soul. Indie. Folk. Gospel. Dub. Heavy Metal. Psychedelia. Jazz, Prog… The list sprawls on even before you get into myriad fusions of genres. With streaming, Spotify, the rise of the superstar DJ, et al, we have completely and irrevocably changed the way we consume and interact with music. Volume. Distribution. Payment (or otherwise). There’s a thought: perhaps there should be a global “cheapskate” personality-category for those who don’t pay for music? Even when people do pay, there’s a sense of cultural free-for-all. Generally, “Young People” approach music song by song, anthem by anthem, club banger by club banger. What research-based personality type (Open? Agreeable?) could be applied to such an elastic approach? Do we just ignore how, like a generational bushfire, it’s caught on throughout age, race and class? How, like it or not, we are all in shuffle mode now? If, like me, you’re still partial to listening to whole albums, digital or vinyl, you may feel increasingly like the last dodo, stubbornly playing Hounds of Love all the way through, creeping ever closer to easy-listening extinction. Just to rub it in, it might not even be “your” music taste any more. Past a certain age, people’s tastes freeze, go on long pause, a form of cultural atrophy sets in. What you think “defines” you may just be your music taste of five, 10, 20 years ago, and, according to the Cambridge findings, you now have an outdated personality to go with it. Diverting though these studies are, there’s no foolproof way of personality-typing music. That jukebox embedded in your skull may end up rusted and ugly, unfit for public consumption, but it will always be unique. Tailored music exists only in the fevered minds of marketing and advertising executives who want to zone you, sell you stuff. It’s not a case of too much music, rather that there’s too much human condition: too many people – restless, vivid, alive – thinking, feeling, and wanting differently from one moment to the next.",Arts/Music,What does your music taste say about you?

2/13/2022,"It seems to be an unwritten rule of the Prime Ministers Club that a former one will not directly call for the resignation of the present one. Theresa May has mercilessly skewered Boris Johnson in the Commons over partygate, but she has refrained from telling him to walk. Sir John Major delivered a powerful speech on Thursday in which he listed all the reasons why Mr Johnson is unfit to remain in office. He “broke lockdown laws”, makes “brazen excuses”, sends his ministers out to “defend the indefensible” and asks the public “to believe the unbelievable”. “Our reputation is being shredded,” declared Sir John and made the vital argument: “Deliberate lies to parliament have been fatal to political careers and must always be so.” This was punchy, pungent and potent. And it was all true. Sir John sounded like he was building up to a clarion call to Conservative MPs to remove Mr Johnson, but then his trumpet went mute. As for David Cameron, we have not heard a peep from him about partygate. In his case, this is probably wise. After the Greensill affair, he is not best placed to get up on his hind trotters to give a lecture on the importance of integrity in public life.  Eager to wound, but unwilling to strike, Sir John and Mrs May reflect the state of the party they once led. It is simultaneously infuriated and paralysed by a scandal that is also a crisis. It is easy to find Tory MPs who are seething about their leader and increasingly hard to find ones who think that Mr Johnson will lead them into the next general election. But it is also hard to find Tories who speak with any conviction about when he will be evicted from Number 10 and easy to find MPs full of excuses for not taking action just yet. This leaves the Tory party and with it the government, marooned in no man’s land. Purely as a matter of self-interest, Tories have clear incentives to dispatch Mr Johnson without delay. His poll ratings are plumbing depths from which leaders almost never recover. The polls also suggest that public fury is dragging his party down with him. “It’s definitely contaminating the wider Tory brand and that’s what’s got so many of us worried,” remarks one Conservative MP. Waiting to see if the polls are verified by a heavy defeat at the May local elections “puts our councillors in the executioner’s tumbril”, as another MP puts it. Key party bankrollers are snapping shut their cheque books. One Tory reports being at a recent dinner with four major and longstanding donors, all of whom were “in despair”. The prime minister is solely focused on trying to save his own skin. He always governed from one week to the next. Now he governs from one day to the next. Government policy is not being designed with a regard to the national interest, or even being shaped around what might be popular with voters. Those involved with “Operation Save Big Dog” admit that the only people who matter to Mr Johnson at the moment are Conservative MPs. Decision-making is entirely driven by his need to appease this Tory faction and placate that Tory groupuscule. Putting it about that there will be a big reshuffle in the summer is a crude ruse to seduce the more gullible careerist parliamentarians. Explaining the inertia of his colleagues, one Tory MP says: “Some are thinking he’s promised me that I’ll be Minister for Paperclips, so why don’t I give him one last chance to make me Minister for Paperclips?” Other Tory backbenchers relish having the prime minister in a prostrate position and desperate to please them. Yet this is not sustainable because different gangs of backbench hostage-takers are demanding conflicting things from Number 10. The more slabs of “red meat” he flings in the direction of ravenous rightwingers, the more he aggravates moderate Tories. One Conservative MP reports: “The phrase you hear a lot of in the tearoom is ‘we can’t go on like this’.” So I asked him whether he had submitted a letter calling for a confidence vote. He confessed that he hadn’t, before arguing that it was too early to move. He was choosing to go on like this. A relatively small number have put in letters and announced it to the world. Others have secretly lodged a missive with Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee. Then there is the substantial group who want Mr Johnson gone, but are hesitant about acting. There are even cases of Tory MPs who have publicly called for the prime minister’s resignation, but not yet written a letter. They privately say that they are holding back until they are more confident that they can cleanly eject him from Number 10. While it only takes 54 Tory MPs to compel a confidence vote, there is a larger and more important figure. That is 181, the minimum number of votes against him needed to ensure his defenestration. “One of the worst outcomes is that we get a confidence vote and he narrowly survives it,” says one senior Tory. “If he wins by just one vote, he will stay. Anyone else would walk, but he will stay.” The majority of Tory MPs are neither dedicated to his removal nor committed to his survival as of today. “Never forget, most of my colleagues are sheep,” remarks one veteran backbencher. The mob sways this way and that, depending on the movement of the polls, news events, the contents of their inboxes and postbags, the media and what activists and fellow MPs are saying to them. Some who have not declared a position say they will spend the 10-day parliamentary recess, which began on Thursday, sampling opinion among constituents and local party members, which is one way of ducking their responsibility to make a decision. Number 10 has just confirmed that Mr Johnson is one of around 50 denizens of Downing Street to receive an investigatory questionnaire from the police. Many Tory MPs justify their vacillation by saying that they are waiting on the detectives and the publication of the unexpurgated version of Sue Gray’s report. Another shocking revelation before then might finally be the trigger for the sheep to stampede against the Tory leader. Cynic that he is, he will be thinking that he has a chance of riding out this scandal because something will turn up to his advantage or his MPs will eventually get bored with partygate. While Tory MPs dither, the behaviour of the prime minister and his understrappers becomes more shameless. Some of his supporters are contending that if he does not get a fine from the police, he will have been exonerated and can carry on in office, as if the many false denials to parliament are of no consequence. Around the time that Dame Cressida Dick was announcing her departure from Scotland Yard, someone close to the prime minister made the outrageous claim that the Met ought to give Mr Johnson a free pass over lockdown-busting. A “senior ally” of the prime minister contended that the police have “a degree of discretion” and implied that they should let him off because you can’t have the “Metropolitan police deciding who the prime minister is”. It is no part of the Met’s remit to consider the political consequences, one way or another. The job of the police is to apply the law without fear or favour and maintain the principle, so often forgotten at Mr Johnson’s Number 10, that no one is above it. “If he gets a ticket from the Met, the game is up,” says one Conservative MP whose view is representative of many others. Yet some around Mr Johnson are pushing the line that he is entitled to carry on as prime minister even if he is fined for breaching the restrictions that he imposed on the rest of the country. The Conservative party will pay a penalty for its prevarication – indeed, it already is paying. The longer this goes on, the more this looks like a lawless government that thinks rules are for everyone else and the deeper the reputational damage sustained by the Tories. “A month ago, this was hurting only Boris,” says one former cabinet minister. “Now, it is hurting the whole government. The more they put up ministers to make a defence of him, the more it damages all of us.” So I asked this senior Tory whether he had put in a confidence letter and discovered he was another who hadn’t done so yet. The government will remain trapped in this nightmare no man’s land, and the country with it, until Tory MPs cease equivocating and a critical mass of them decide to bring things to a head.

2/13/2022,"Iwas working as a GP when a new respiratory illness began crossing the globe. So much rewriting of history has happened since that it’s easy to forget how anarchic things felt in March 2020. Devastating images from China and Italy were followed by a deafening silence from the British government. Junior doctors were left to implore the government to lock down on social media and TV. In our clinic, left to our own devices, we mocked up an infection control room, saw patients in cars, improvised PPE, and rotated shifts in clinic and on the phone to reduce infection. Roopa Farooki’s brilliant, raging stream of consciousness relates 40 days in her life as a junior doctor. An award-winning author, she retrained as a doctor and was in her first year working at an English seaside hospital when SARS-CoV-2 arrived here.  Forty days is the period Venetian ships were kept at anchor to reduce transmission when they docked from disease-infected ports in the 14th century, but during the chaotic opening stages of the Covid-19 pandemic Farooki is in constant motion, walking along dual carriageways and fields from her family home with her husband and children, to the hospital and its virus. She is also reeling from the recent death of her rivalrous older sister, Kiron, from breast cancer. At the end of each exhausting day she reaches for her laptop and writes this memoir: “stolen moments in the unobserved night, like a guilty grandad sucking down a secret cigarette”. The result is vivid and immediate, fragmentary and unalloyed. In Farooki’s hospital many think fears of the virus are overblown, but within a week staff are going off sick with it, the hospital gets overloaded and people start dying; many having caught the disease there. Claps and banging of pans and self-serving soundbites from politicians contrast with the suffering and inadequacy surrounding her – an already threadbare healthcare system, chaotic pandemic guidance, hopeless PPE, minimal testing and two treatments, oxygen and proning (“tummy time”, as an ITU consultant dubs it). As patients cough, vomit and bleed on the medics, a young colleague of Farooki’s dies of Covid in their intensive care unit. Why go to work when you may be robbing your children of a mother, Farooki’s relatives ask. When she has a rare day off, people jump out of her way on the seafront and shelves in the supermarket are empty. And on top of all this she carries the heavy burden of grief and guilt at her sister Kiron’s death. “Friend is too big and small a word for what you were... You were generous with physical affection and violence. Long childish cuddles on the sofa. Casual childish slaps and scratches and kicks and punches.” She knows people do not suddenly become heroes because they have died, nor because they have become doctors. Writing in the second person, Farooki’s voice often melds with that of her sister. As circumstances designed to promote self-pity or self-congratulation pile up, Kiron/Farooki won’t allow it. Kiron is her constant companion, her secret sharer, as everyday life begins to implode. “I don’t know how you can go to work, she says. Picking at you like a wasp. It’s selfish. It’s unsafe. […] And for the record, I don’t think you’re a hero. I don’t think you’re brave. I think you’re just a mildly talented eccentric who’s stumbled into a stupid time to start medicine. “You’re right, you say. Thank you.” In an age of amnesia and dishonesty, I loved the unedited, unflattering truth of the thoughts and feelings that Farooki’s exhausted brain trawls at the end of each gruelling day. The patients who sicken and asphyxiate, the buzz of social media, hospital rules that volte face without explanation, memories of decisions from earlier in her life along with the voices of parents and Kiron, patients, her children and husband; all meld into a pointillist narrative. “You fill the bottles with the ascitic fluid for testing. Cytology, biochemistry, protein. You check the tracing of a heart. You manage soaring blood sugars. […] “You walk home. “You admire the children’s work. “They start fighting about something stupid, the death of a virtual llama, the malicious uncharging of a tablet, the design on a painted pot, an insult at the table, and you shout at them, and then you start crying. And then the ones who started it start crying too.” As Conservatives make their appalling claim that Boris Johnson has had a good pandemic, despite the underfunding, delays, indifference and charlatanism, it’s cathartic to travel back with Farooki’s memoir into the mess of the 40 days, the quaranta giorni, from which it all sprang. 34 Patients by Tom Templeton is published in paperback by Michael Joseph on 31 March  Everything Is True by Roopa Farooki is published by Bloomsbury (£14.99).

2/13/2022,"Sitting in a blue armchair, vaping with one hand and making phone calls with the other, Yevhen Murayev, Ukrainian politician and backer of the Nash television station, spent last week desperately trying to save his career. In recent weeks, his swanky television studios, housed in an industrial building not far from central Kyiv, have been picketed by groups of angry nationalists, and on Friday Ukraine’s security council imposed sanctions on the channel, effectively taking it off the air with immediate effect. He is not able to appeal against the decision.  The reason, Murayev believes, is Britain. An unusual statement released by the Foreign Office three weeks ago referenced unspecified intelligence purporting to show Russia was plotting a coup in Ukraine to install a puppet government in Kyiv. “The former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev is being considered as a potential candidate,” read the statement, released in time to make the front of the Sunday newspapers. “It’s clear with the release of this statement that Britain decided it was going to be part of an information operation,” said Mark Galeotti, a Russia-focused political analyst. British and US officials say that by releasing statements such as this one, they are letting Russia know they are aware of Moscow’s plans and making it harder for the Russians to implement them. The Murayev announcement, however, was greeted with confusion and chuckles in Kyiv, given his low popularity ratings in most parts of the country. “It just didn’t sound right at all. This is not a government that could be imposed in Kyiv,” said a diplomatic source, adding that it would only make sense if Russia intended to divide the country and set up a regional government in the east. Murayev said he was on holiday with his family on a tropical island when he began receiving calls from British journalists who wanted his comment about allegations he was the figurehead of a Russian coup. “At first I thought it was some kind of prank,” he said. The Foreign Office statement named Murayev, as well as four other politicians who fled Ukraine after the 2014 Maidan revolution, including former prime minister Mykola Azarov, who has lived in Moscow ever since. Murayev said he had helped Azarov to escape from Ukraine in the heat of the revolution, driving him across the border to Russia, but since then has had no meaningful contact with him or the other men named. “Since then we have just spoken occasionally by phone, usually to wish each other happy birthday,” Murayev said. He claimed he has not visited Russia since 2015 and has been under Russian sanctions since 2018 after falling out with Viktor Medvedchuk, another pro-Kremlin politician, who is a personal friend of Vladimir Putin. “The British have publicly labelled me a collaborator, and now the Ukrainians are targeting me and there’s no public evidence,” he said. Like with so much of the recent publicised intelligence, it is certainly plausible someone in Moscow may have tapped up Murayev, one of the few politicians in Ukraine who is friendly to the Russian position. But it is hard to know whether the statement was based on rock-solid information or informal contingency plans. For Murayev, the biggest irritation was that he was named as someone who was “being considered”, but was not directly accused of anything. “How can I defend myself against the allegation when nobody has provided any evidence against me? I can’t even sue the British, because they phrased it very carefully. They haven’t directly accused me of being involved, just that some people may have been thinking of using me,” he said. The crescendo of intelligence briefings declaring that a Russian invasion of Ukraine is imminent has mostly emanated from Washington in recent weeks, but Britain has emerged as the leading supporting voice, backing up US claims about the present danger. The Foreign Office has stood firmly behind US messages that the threat of a full-scale invasion is real and may come at any time, even as other European capitals and the Ukrainian government have remained more sceptical. This has been combined with a number of high-profile visits to Ukraine and Russia this month, starting with Boris Johnson’s visit to Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and followed last week with two ministerial visits to Moscow. The first of them – foreign secretary Liz Truss’s trip on Thursday – did not go well. One politically connected source in Kyiv compared the spectacle of Truss going up against Russia’s wily and experienced foreign minister Sergei Lavrov to “Champions League meets Sunday league”. A bad-tempered meeting ended with an acrimonious press conference and the Russian side commenting on a gaffe Truss had made during talks. Reportedly, as Truss noted the ominous Russian military buildup close to the Ukrainian border, Lavrov asked her whether Britain recognised Moscow’s sovereignty over the Rostov and Voronezh regions, where much of the buildup is taking place. Truss allegedly told Lavrov that Britain would “never” do so, before the British ambassador intervened to gently mention to Truss that these regions were in fact inside Russia. Before long, news of the geographical slip-up was being gleefully reported across Russian and international media. Truss seemed to confirm the reports when she said in an interview with a Russian newspaper that she had thought Lavrov was talking about regions of Ukraine. Truss returned to London with little sign she had made any progress either on divining Russia’s intentions or on delivering a useful message to Moscow. “I honestly have no idea why she went to Russia, except for the photo op,” said Galeotti. On Friday, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, met his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, a key member of Putin’s inner circle who rarely meets western ministers. Wallace described the talks as “frank and constructive”, and the visit lacked the adversarial jockeying of the Truss trip. In addition to the visits to Kyiv and Moscow, Britain has been more forthright providing weapons to the Ukrainian army than many European countries, and there has been gratitude in Kyiv for Britain’s forceful stance. But the intelligence briefings have not been as well received. “The majority of people in Ukraine took the British statement with enormous scepticism,” said Volodymyr Fesenko, a Kyiv-based political analyst. He suggested a popular theory was that the information may have been leaked to the British by personal enemies of Murayev. “I think the British may have been played,” Fesenko said.",News/World news,‘Britain called me a collaborator.

2/13/2022,"Oksana Riwnyj remembers life under Soviet rule. “When I was at university, I wasn’t allowed to speak up and say what I think. We couldn’t go to church or celebrate Christmas. It was very tough, especially for the young people,” the 58-year-old primary school teacher said. Now, the news of Russia assembling troops on the Ukrainian border triggers memories that bring her to tears. “I never thought something like this could happen. It’s too horrible to even think about,” she said.  Riwnyj is one of about 70,000 Ukrainians living in the UK who are watching anxiously to see what will unfold over the coming days. The mother-of-two lived for the first two decades of her life in western Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union, which was toppled in 1991. She moved to the UK after meeting her husband, Stefan, a gas engineer, 25 years ago, and has a happy life in London, where – as a teacher at St Mary’s Ukrainian Saturday school – she is at the heart of the expatriate community. But while safe on UK soil, as the crisis in her home country intensifies, she is struggling to carry on with life as normal. “I’m trying to go about daily life but it’s a very stressful and worrying situation,” Riwnyj said. “I can’t sleep because all my family are over there.” For Diana Palamarchuk, 17, who grew up in Ternopil Oblast in western Ukraine but moved to the UK six years ago, watching the crisis play out on screen is difficult to take in. “It doesn’t really feel real because I haven’t been there and seen it with my own eyes. When you’re watching it on TV, it feels like you’re watching a film,” the A-level student said. While teachers at her school ask her how she is, most of the other pupils have no idea what’s going on in Ukraine. “Some of my friends know about it but not many,” she said. “The only thing people know about Ukraine is Chernobyl, and lots of people think Ukraine is poor, with dumb people. But it isn’t. It’s a beautiful country and Ukrainians are good people.” She said seeing what was happening was “really tough” because she still has family there. But she has been heartened by statements from British and US politicians warning Vladimir Putin of the potential consequences of any aggression. “Hopefully, it will make Russia think twice about it,” she said. Iryna Pereginyak, 41, a learning support assistant, is also trying to remain positive. But her brother, 34, remains in Ukraine – and faces being called to fight if there is a war. “I am a very hopeful person but we are living in fear and anticipation of the worst,” she said. “Sometimes I have to just switch off and escape and watch a film, but there is no feeling of complete peace. It’s constant.” Vlodko Pawluk, an administrator from Barnet, London, and chair of the London branch of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, is coordinating efforts to raise money that could be used to pay for supplies for those affected if the worst does happen, including soldiers serving on the frontline and people displaced by conflict. He said he was grateful for support from the UK and the US, but that many Ukrainians felt a little “bitter”. “Everybody knows this has been going on for a while, since the annexation of Crimea. But it feels like for eight years, the west has done nothing,” he said. “These sorts of conflicts belong to the last century, not in Europe in 2022. This could be a full-scale, bloody war.” Natalia Ravlyuk, 41, a retail manager originally from Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine, described the situation as “very scary”. “I don’t know what to say to my relatives. I’m chaotically thinking, ‘What can we do here?’ We are demonstrating every week near the Russian embassy and at Downing St. “I personally feel guilty being here because they are unsafe there and I’m safe here,” she said. Watching events unfold from 1,400 miles away, she feels “helpless”. “I just want to do something and everything will be back to normal,” she said. “But what can we do?”",News/World news,"‘It’s horrible, I can’t sleep’: Ukrainians in London face anxious wait from afar",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/13/its-horrible-i-cant-sleep-ukrainians-in-london-face-anxious-wait-from-afar
