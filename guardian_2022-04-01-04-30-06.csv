4/1/2022,"A 19-year-old economics student from the University of Cambridge has become the youngest person to ever win the National Poetry Competition. Eric Yip, who is from Hong Kong, won for his poem Fricatives, which plays with ideas about language to also comment on colonialism, race, migration, belonging and the guilt of leaving one’s home behind. “It was such a complete shock for me [to have won],” Yip told the Guardian. “Poetry is definitely one of the arts where you get better with age because you have more lived experiences and you read more and you write more. “Being 19, I try to think of it as I still have a lot more poetry to write and a lot more poetry to read. I see this win as a beginning, an encouragement for me to keep writing and to keep improving.” Yip’s work was chosen by judges Fiona Benson, David Constantine and Rachel Long, who read all the entries anonymously. The title, Fricatives, comes from the term given to a type of consonant made by the friction of breath in a narrow opening, producing a turbulent air flow, including the sounds “f” or “th”, such as in “free” or “three”. Benson said: “Fricatives is an immensely ambitious and beautifully achieved poem. It puts its reader into the position of a student of English as a second language, the fricative consonants tangling our mouths as we speak the poem, and intriguing us with the alternate meanings that rest precariously on the pronunciation. ‘Proper’ achievements – the correct pronunciation, the good education abroad, and the proud parents – are countered by an underworld of political prisoners and risky, grim sex.” She added: “This is an incredibly powerful, vulnerable story of an uneasy assimilation, and of government surveillance… It’s a poem of poise and counterpoise, and is personal, political and acutely musical. What a tensile, high-wire reckoning.” Yip, who cites Ocean Vuong as a writer who made him realise he “had a right” to be heard, speaks Cantonese and Mandarin, but writes poetry in English. “You almost feel a little bit guilty because when you’re writing in English and when you write about Hong Kong, your home, your own culture, you’re actively engaging in translation,” he said. “That’s something I’m very conscious about and it’s one of the themes I wanted to explore.” Yip won £5,000 for the first prize. The National Poetry Competition also named nine other winners, including 92-year-old MR Peacocke for her poem Out of School. All 10 poems will be published on the Poetry Society’s website, with Yip’s poem and the second and third placed works – I Picture Him Driving by Jed Myers and Emma Purshouse’s poem Catherine Eddowes’ Tin Box As a Key Witness – also published in the spring 2022 issue of the Poetry Review. Past winners of the competition, which began in 1978, include Sinéad Morrissey, Ruth Padel, James Berry, Carol Ann Duffy, Jo Shapcott and Tony Harrison.

4/1/2022,"A harsh lesson for Arsenal, perhaps even a reckoning of sorts. Defeat at Hoffenheim could be written off an aberration and their humbling by Barcelona excused by the sheer class of the opposition. But on a freezing night in Lower Saxony there would be no escape from the cold reality that Arsenal – and by extension, the English club game as a whole – is still some way short of where it needs to be. Jill Roord and an own goal by Leah Williamson put Wolfsburg firmly into the semi-finals of the Champions League. In truth they dominated without even being at their best. Certainly they will need to raise their game several notches to trouble the brilliant Barcelona Femeni in the last four. But their quick, enterprising, hard-running game was more than good enough here, a reinforcement of the old truth that a team with a plan will usually beat a team with none. Perhaps that sounds a touch harsh on Jonas Eidevall’s side, missing Beth Mead and Lia Walti to injury, but there were long periods here when Arsenal seemed to have very little clue how to progress the ball, how to convert possession into chances, how to penetrate a standard of organisation they have so rarely faced in the Women’s Super League. In part Arsenal had no answers because they are so rarely required to find them. The WSL is a fine product that has made supreme strides, but it remains a league in thrall to individual star quality, where the art of team-building remains – with a very few exceptions – largely neglected. To take one example: how has a club of Arsenal’s resources managed to arrive at this crucial stage of the season with no idea of their best midfield? The lack of imagination here was collective, and in a game that was essentially the polar opposite of the first leg at the Emirates Stadium – Wolfsburg making the running, Arsenal forced to soak up pressure – their inexperience at this level was telling. But you only really learn these lessons by living them, and Arsenal will be better for this experience. They will learn from Wolfsburg’s superior game management, the way they work the officials, the way they invariably emerge from 50-50s with a free-kick. They will learn, too, from the stage: the still-giddy novelty of big European away days, the tyranny of fine margins, the importance of starting well. Even before Roord’s goal there were little fires appearing everywhere. The threat of Svenja Huth on the right wing was drawing Steph Catley out wide, leaving a big gap in the channel to exploit. More than once the brilliant Lena Oberdorf made dangerous runs into that space, while a series of crosses and set pieces created an early swell of pressure. From a ninth-minute corner, a goalmouth scramble, and a goal. Oberdorf won the first ball, Sveindis Jonsdottir nudged it goalwards and despite facing the wrong way Roord was able to hook the ball in with marvellous agility and improvisation against her former club. It never really worked out for Roord at Arsenal, more for lifestyle than footballing reasons – a product of being stranded far from home in the middle of a pandemic – but here was a bitter glimpse of what might have been. Arsenal had no answers to Roord in between the lines, no real counter to Oberdorf in midfield. Stina Blackstenius and Tobin Heath struggled to get into the game, and Heath would later be withdrawn at half-time. More chances came: Tabea Wassmuth had a goal ruled out for offside, Manuela Zinsberger saved from Huth. Yet the margin remained just one goal, and in the second half Arsenal slowly began to come into it. Perhaps fatigue was a factor for Wolfsburg. This was their eighth game in a month, with Bayern Munich to come on Sunday. And so even as Arsenal half-chances began to appear like little snowflakes, they seemed happy to control without pushing too hard, confident in their ability to finish the game off. And with 18 minutes left, they were proved right. Again Arsenal failed to clear their lines, Jonsdottir put in a hopeful cross, Williamson stuck out a foot and Zinsberger was powerless to stop it. It was a warming and deserved triumph for Wolfsburg, who over the last decade have shown what you can do with a little investment, a little pride and a little care. The crowd of more than 11,000 at the Volkswagen Arena – almost a tenth of the town’s population – included several members of the men’s team who normally play here, and produced a relentless fiesta of songs and percussion, streamers and confetti, just 24 hours after 91,000 fans packed out the Camp Nou. It will be small comfort to Arsenal, but these are stunningly exciting times for the women’s game.",Sport/Football,Wolfsburg’s Jill Roord helps knock former club Arsenal out of WCL,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/31/wolfsburg-arsenal-womens-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report
4/1/2022,"Britain’s defence secretary has said western nations have agreed to send armoured vehicles and long-range artillery to Ukraine, at a special donor conference attended by more than 35 countries, including the US. Ben Wallace, who convened the event, said there would be “more lethal aid going into Ukraine” but that it would not include tanks or some of the other more deadly weapons that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had asked for in the past week. He said Ukraine needed longer-range artillery to counter Russian attacks on the its cities, including Mariupol in the south, which has been subjected to relentless shelling. “The best counter to that is other long-range artillery, so they’ll be looking for and getting more long-range artillery, ammunition predominantly,” he said in an interview after the conference concluded. Ukraine was also “looking for armoured vehicles of some types, not tanks necessarily, but certainly protective vehicles, and more anti-air,” Wallace said. “All of this will be forthcoming as result of this conference.” The commitments to provide artillery pieces, shells and armoured vehicles represent a step up from the weaponry previously supplied, which has been characterised by Nato members as defensive. Nato countries led by the US, UK and Turkey had previously agreed to supply Javelin surface-to-air missiles, next generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAWs), Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and TB2 drones, all of which have helped blunt the Russian invasion over the past five weeks. Zelenskiy has repeatedly asked western nations in the last fortnight for tanks, fighter jets and sophisticated anti-missile and anti-aircraft weaponry so his country’s forces can try to force Russia’s troops out of the country. He pleaded for “military assistance without restrictions” at Nato’s summit last week, asking specifically for “1% of all your planes, 1% of your tanks” because Russia was using “its entire arsenal against us”. Western leaders, however, have been nervous about supplying offensive weapons, most notably fighter jets, fearing that it would unnecessarily provoke a nuclear-armed Russia and could invite some form of retaliation from Moscow. More than 35 countries participated in the donor conference, including European nations, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand, but their individual commitments were not immediately clear. Some countries intend to supply Ukraine with their own stocks, while others have offered Kyiv money to buy its own arms. Those present discussed “whether we need to change the type of aid we give, which of course we will do now as the tactics in the ground change”, Wallace said. Russia abandoned its attempt to capture Kyiv this week after an unexpectedly chaotic assault on the country. Instead it has refocussed its efforts on capturing the southern port city of Mariupol and gaining ground against Ukraine’s main fighting force in the eastern Donbas region. Ukraine’s most obvious military problem is its inability to counter the ceaseless Russian shelling that has caused so many civilian casualties in Mariupol. Ukraine estimates that 5,000 people have been killed in the city, but the figure cannot be verified because of the ongoing fighting. The countries present also agreed to supply coastal defence systems, the UK Ministry of Defence said, which could help defend the southern city of Odessa and disrupt Russian warships in the Black Sea from launching cruise missiles. Several western countries have been running down their own stocks to supply Ukraine, but David Williams, the permanent secretary of the MoD, said British arms manufacturers supplying NLAWs and other kit being used in the war had been asked to increase production to replenish what had been used.",News/World news,"West to send ‘more lethal aid’ to Ukraine, UK defence minister says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/west-to-send-more-lethal-aid-to-ukraine-uk-defence-minister-says
4/1/2022,"The president of cycling’s governing body has held emergency talks with other international sports federations about creating tougher new rules for the participation of trans women in elite women’s sport “within months”. In a notable intervention, the UCI president, David Lappartient, said cycling’s current rules, which allow trans women to compete against cis women if they reduce their testosterone to below 5 nmol/L for a period of 12 months, were “probably not enough” to ensure fair competition. He also suggested that other sports including athletics and swimming were in a similar boat and that coordinated action might be needed. “It is a very sensitive topic at the moment,” he said. “The question is, is there a memory from your body from what you were before? Do you have an advantage for this? Do we have a breach of fair competition? “When you ask this question, it is not to challenge the fact that people want to transition. We fully respect that. “But I can also really understand from ladies [who] say: ‘OK, we don’t accept this.’ At the moment, the union of women’s riders are completely against this and challenging the UCI. So we are in between.” The participation of trans women in elite sport has become a topical issue with the US swimmer Lia Thomas becoming the first trans athlete to win a national college title a fortnight ago. Lappartient, meanwhile, said that cycling had “one big case in Great Britain” in the form of trans woman cyclist Emily Bridges, who set a national junior 25-mile record as a man in 2018. Bridges was hoping to compete in her first race as a woman at the British National Omnium Championships on Saturday but has since been barred by the UCI as she is still registered as a male competitor. The Guardian also understands that Bridges will not be selected for the British team for the UCI Track Nations Cup, starting on 21 April, when it is announced on Friday. Lappartient said: “I had some discussions this week with the Olympians associations, with some international federations. In cycling, in swimming, in athletics, the question of fair competition is really a question we must put on the table. Is it a right to take part when you do the transition at the highest level or do we have to see if this will affect the fairness of competition?” “I believe that maybe the situation we have now, of the rules of five nanomoles per litre [to measure testosterone levels], is probably not enough. “Clearly this is something we have to put on the agenda of the Association of Summer International Olympic Federation because we can’t solve this alone, we have to work together,” he told the BBC. “We can’t just close our eyes on what is happening and this is something we have to do within the next months.” Earlier this week swimming’s governing body, Fina, proposed a new rule that will require trans women to reduce their testosterone for at least 36 months before competing in the women’s category – and put the burden of proof on the athlete to demonstrate they have no retained advantage. The proposal is likely to be voted on in June.Meanwhile World Triathlon said it was currently working on an update of its rules to ensure fair competition, which will be released later in April. The president of World Triathlon’s medical committee, Dr Sergio Migliorini, told the Guardian: “We have a working group on this matter including members of the medical committee, sport dept, women’s committee, and executive board in order to update our rules during 2022 to have fair competition between transgender and cisgender. “We hope that the International Olympic Committee framework will be improved, considering also the medical/scientific aspect of this matter, and with the cooperation of the IFs/IOC medical committee and the scientific experts in this matter.”",Sport/Sport,Cycling in urgent talks with other sports over tougher rules for trans athletes,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/31/cycling-in-urgent-talks-with-other-sports-over-tougher-rules-for-trans-athletes
4/1/2022,"A timely adventure story that tackles environmental themes has been named winner of this year’s Waterstones children’s book prize. The Last Bear by Hannah Gold, illustrated by Levi Pinfold, follows April, the daughter of an Arctic researcher, as she befriends a lone polar bear. The £5,000 award is judged by the Waterstones booksellers, one of whom, Sorcha, from the chain’s Cambridge shop, called The Last Bear a “future classic”, finding the novel “timely and thought-provoking, but ultimately heartwarming”. Another, Ryan, from Waterstones Oldham, said the story is “gorgeous and emotional” and a “poignant reminder of the importance of environmentalism”. Gold, who was also named winner of the younger readers’ category, was up against the winners of the other two categories for the overall award. Ciara Smyth’s Not My Problem, about a high school rule breaker, won the older readers’ category while Harry Woodgate’s Grandad’s Camper, which celebrates LGBT+ history, took the prize for illustrated books. The Last Bear stood out from the crowd, though, said Waterstones head of children’s, Florentyna Martin, who described Gold’s first novel as a “triumphant debut”. “Hannah’s impeccable storytelling builds immersive landscapes and an inspirational friendship born of bravery and kindness”, she added. “Our booksellers have expertly chosen a winner that provides a symbol of hope to the next generation; part battle cry, part love letter to our planet, April and Bear’s unique bond will teach every young reader how to roar.” Lincolnshire-based Gold previously worked in the film and magazine industries before becoming a full-time writer. She has described The Last Bear as “a book of [her] heart” and as a chance to inspire children with the message that “no one is too small or insignificant to make a difference about the things they truly care about”.

4/1/2022,"Boris Johnson has ditched plans for a legal ban on conversion practices despite repeated promises for such a move, Downing Street has confirmed. The government announced the change of policy after it emerged in a leaked document obtained by ITV News. A government spokesperson said: “Having explored this sensitive issue in great depth the government has decided to proceed by reviewing how existing law can be deployed more effectively to prevent this in the quickest way possible, and explore the use of other non-legislative measures.” Conversion practices attempt to change or suppress a person’s sexuality or gender identity and Johnson and his predecessor Theresa May promised to make it illegal. The move to drop plans for a legal ban was condemned by the Liberal Democrats. The party’s equalities spokesperson, the MP Wera Hobhouse, said: “This is not just yet another U-turn from the Tories, but giving the green light to a form of torture in the UK. This is an utter betrayal of the LGBT+ community. “Conversion therapy should have been banned years ago, but the Conservatives are looking the other way on this abusive and dangerous practice, this is a complete injustice. The government must ban it without dither or delay.” The document leaked to ITV News, titled Conversion Therapy Handling Plan, recommends announcing the U-turn at the time of the Queen’s speech in May. “This will allow us to position the decision as prioritising our legislative programme, and reduces the risk of looking like we have singled out an LGBT issue,” it says. The leaked briefing also recommends blaming the change of heart on “pressures on the cost of living and the crisis in Ukraine”. It warns that the equalities minister Mike Freer, who has been a firm advocate of a ban, could be prompted to resign by the change in policy. Freer told MPs in the House of Commons this week the government remained “wholly committed” to the plan. There is also speculation in the note that Liz Truss, the women and equalities minister, may be “concerned about owning the new position”, because although she is not ideologically wedded to a ban, she has repeatedly promised one. Truss is in India, where she has been discussing the situation in Ukraine with her Indian counterpart. It is unclear what has prompted the shift in the government’s position, though some backbench Tory MPs had opposed a ban on religious freedom grounds.",News/World news,Boris Johnson ditches plans for ban on LGBT conversion practices ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/boris-johnson-ditches-plans-for-ban-on-lgbt-conversion-practices
4/1/2022,"The 6ft 2in Scottish actor John Stahl, who has died aged 68 of a brain tumour, was best known for two television roles. He went from playing a gentle giant toiling on a farm in his home country’s scenic highlands in Take the High Road to portraying the head of a noble house, complete with long white hair and thick grey beard, in Game of Thrones, the fantasy drama that became a worldwide hit. In the Scottish soap – eventually retitled High Road – he was the shy, good-natured crofter Tom Kerr, known to all in the fictional village of Glendarroch, on the banks of Loch Lomond, as Inverdarroch, after his farm. The character was unlucky in love, never plucking up the courage to propose to Lily Taylor (played by Thelma Rogers), a widow, then experiencing a failed marriage to Claire Millar (Julie Miller), the district nurse. When she had an affair with the villainous Davie Sneddon (Derek Lord), factor of the Glendarroch estate, Inverdarroch picked up his shotgun and headed for a showdown. Eventually, he broke the gun and slowly poured a glass from the whisky bottle that Sneddon had pushed towards him, before leaving without another word. Stahl joined Take the High Road in 1982, two years after it began as a daytime soap across the ITV network – although screened at peak time by Scottish Television, which produced it – and he stayed on and off until it ended in 2003. In later years, he movingly portrayed Inverdarroch being diagnosed with – and surviving – breast cancer, at that time seen by many males as a stigma. He fully embraced the storyline, which triggered letters from men, or their partners, who had endured the trauma themselves and were grateful that the publicity was bringing it to a wider audience. High Road was seen in countries as far afield as Sri Lanka, Turkey, Zimbabwe and Saudi Arabia, but Stahl reached even more viewers worldwide when he was cast in Game of Thrones as Rickard Karstark, the Lord of Karhold and head of House Karstark. In the story, based on George RR Martin’s books, it was one of nine noble families fighting for control over the seven kingdoms of the mythical continent of Westeros and the Iron Throne. In the programme’s first series began in 2011, the character was played by Steve Blount for an episode. Having already been turned down for two roles in Game of Thrones, Ser Rodrik Cassel and Jeor Mormont, Stahl was reticent about auditioning again when the part was being recast. His agent encouraged him and, on discovering that Rickard was to have a Yorkshire accent, he intriguingly tried to recreate that of Fred Feast, the Scarborough-born actor who had played the Rovers Return pot-man Fred Gee in Coronation Street decades earlier. Over two series (2012-13), as the Houses of Karstark and Stark, one-time allies, became sworn enemies, Stahl’s character saw his son Torrhen killed and ended up being executed. Between the two runs, Stahl was appearing with the Royal Shakespeare Company, which caused continuity problems. “When I did the first series, my beard was down to my chest and my hair was down to my shoulders,” he explained, “so they had to make a wig and beard for me to match up.” The actor was born John Steele in Sauchie, Clackmannanshire, to Nan (Annie, nee Johnstone), a former shop assistant, and Alec (Alexander) Steele, a coppersmith in a local distillery. His love of acting began in school productions at Alloa academy, and he performed in works by Shakespeare and Harold Pinter at a local youth theatre. Then he trained at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, in Glasgow. On graduating, he became an actor and assistant director at Darlington drama centre (1975-76), and as there was another John Steele he took the stage name of Stahl from an actor he admired. He made his television debut in the Scottish soap Garnock Way, as PC Scoular, the local bobby in a mining community (1976-79). Some ITV regions outside Scotland screened the serial. On stage, Stahl not only performed at Cumbernauld theatre, in Lanternhouse, Lanarkshire, but also directed productions there and was responsible for introducing a children’s summer holiday pantomime in 1982. For many years, his own panto roles included Widow Twankey and one of the Ugly Sisters. His stage presence began to shine through and, in 2001, he moved to London. He had several stints with the RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon between 2004 and 2013, renewing his association with its artistic director, Michael Boyd, having previously worked with him at the Tron theatre in Glasgow. In 2011, he brought wry humour to his part as a poor Shetland crofter making money by grave-robbing, alongside Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller, in a National theatre company production of Frankenstein directed by Danny Boyle. A year earlier, he had made his home back in Scotland with Jane Paton, his partner since 2000, and they built their own home on the Isle of Lewis, in the Outer Hebrides. He said they had been at drama school together but he was too shy to ask her out then. Last year, they became Scotland’s first opposite-sex civil partners. Stahl’s 1982 marriage to Doreen Cunningham ended in divorce. Jane and his mother survive him.

4/1/2022,"Florida cannot change certain voting laws without getting preapproval from a federal court for the next decade, a federal judge ruled on Thursday, saying the state has an ongoing and extensive history of discrimination against non-white voters that warranted extraordinary oversight. US district judge Mark Walker put the state back under preclearance on Thursday as part of a 288-page ruling striking down new voting restrictions in Florida limiting the availability of drop boxes, and making it more difficult for third-party groups to register voters. “Florida has repeatedly, recently, and persistently acted to deny Black Floridians access to the franchise,” he wrote in his opinion. Placing a state under federal preclearance is an extraordinary, and rarely used, action. A provision of the Voting Rights Act allows judges to place jurisdictions under federal supervision if there is evidence of intentional discrimination. Until Thursday, courts have not placed any states back under supervision since the supreme court’s 2013 decision in Shelby County v Holder. “Without preclearance, Florida can pass unconstitutional restrictions like the registration disclaimer with impunity,” Walker wrote in his opinion. “Without preclearance, Florida could continue to enact such laws, replacing them every legislative session if courts view them with skepticism. Such a scheme makes a mockery of the rule of law. Under any metric, preclearance is needed.” Florida is expected to quickly appeal the ruling. The state is likely to find a more favorable audience in the US court of appeals for the 11th circuit and the US supreme court, which have both looked skeptically on challenges to new voting laws. Walker appeared to acknowledge the court’s hostility to voting rights in his ruling, writing “the right to vote, and the VRA particularly, are under siege”. In addition to the preclearance requirement, Walker’s opinion blocked a provision in the law that required election officials to continuously monitor ballot drop boxes and made them less available outside early voting hours. He also blocked a requirement that third-party voter registration groups provide voters a disclaimer that they might not deliver their registration in a timely manner. He also blocked a provision prohibiting assistance within 150ft of a polling place. Those requirements, he said, ran afoul of both the US constitution and the Voting Rights Act. The legislature enacted some of those provisions, Walker wrote, intending to discriminate against Black voters. Black voters are more likely, on average, to use drop boxes, he noted, and the legislature restricted their availability during times when Black voters were more likely to use them. Non-white voters are also more likely to rely on third-party voter registration groups than white voters and likely to wait longer in line at the polls, Walker noted. The legislature, he said, was aware of data showing the disparate impact. “The Legislature would not have passed the drop-box provisions, the solicitation definition, or the registration return provision absent an intent to discriminate against Black voters,” he wrote. A spokesperson for Florida governor Ron DeSantis did not immediately return a request for comment.",News/US news,"Florida must seek court preapproval to change some voting laws, judge rules",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/31/florida-voting-laws-discrimination-black-voters
4/1/2022,"My friend and colleague Muriel Chamberlain, who has died aged 89, was the first female dean at the University of Swansea, and went on to become professor of history and head of department. She was born in Leicester, the only child of Arthur Chamberlain, a railway station official, and Gladys (nee Shortland), a teacher and artist. Her father was posted to Bristol and Preston, and ended his career as stationmaster at Leeds; she went to school in all three cities. Muriel took up a place at St Hilda’s College, Oxford, in 1951 and gained a first in history, followed by a DPhil on European diplomatic history in the 19th century. After a spell lecturing at Royal Holloway College, she moved to Swansea in 1959. Three years later she bought a semi, and her parents came to live with her after her father retired. She proceeded steadily up the ladder of promotion, becoming dean at Swansea in 1975 and was appointed a professor in 1987. In 1989 she was voted head of department by an overwhelming margin, and later served a second term before retiring in 1997, though she continued to write articles and revise her books. Muriel was sagacious and eminently fair, and as a result was often asked to be on panels and committees, audit other universities and act as an external examiner. Her published work was chiefly on empire and Commonwealth history, but she also wrote an outstanding biography of Lord Aberdeen, the prime minister at the start of the Crimean war. She was vice-chairman of the Historical Association and for many years the editor of the Historian. She had many interests outside academia – the National Trust, the Historic Gardens Trust , the Victorian Society, the Glamorgan History Society, and was for long time the chairman of the trustees of the Cambrian Archaeological Society. Muriel was a great traveller and visited almost every country in the world, often journeying alone. She enjoyed opera and was a prominent member of the Liberal Democrats. Latterly, her health deteriorated and she had to move to a care home.
