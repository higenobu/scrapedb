1/5/2022,"The merits of Virginia Giuffre’s sex assault lawsuit against Prince Andrew are still far from being tested in court. In New York on Tuesday, lawyers for the prince asked a judge, Lewis Kaplan, to stop the case ever getting there.  Commenting on the case, other New York lawyers were doubtful that Andrew’s legal team would be successful and questioned why the prince’s representatives had not settled out-of-court. Andrew says he has no memory of meeting Giuffre and vehemently denies alleged assaults in London, New York and the US Virgin Islands when Giuffre was 17. On Tuesday, the lawyer Andrew Brad Brettler argued that the case against the prince should be thrown out, on the basis of a 2009 financial settlement between Giuffre and the financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Kaplan released the text of the 2009 settlement on Monday. It showed Giuffre agreed to “remise, release, acquit, satisfy and forever discharge the said second parties and any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant”. Brettler also said Giuffre’s claims were not adequately described in her complaint against Andrew, which he said was filed just five days short of the closing of a statute of limitations window in the New York state Child Victims Act. Jeanne Christensen of Wigdor, a law firm with clients including a woman who alleges rape and harassment by the Wall Street financier and Epstein associate Leon Black and claimants in civil suits against the disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein, said Andrew was almost certainly not covered by the 2009 agreement. Imprecise wording suggests the existence of a second agreement with named parties that has never come to light, Christensen said. “Aside from the fact that it’s horribly worded with over-broad, vague language, it really should not be sustained because it could cover anybody Epstein knows,” she said. “It doesn’t matter who [Andrew’s] lawyers think falls within that definition. It’s not going to be of help.” The lawyer Alan Dershowitz has claimed the agreement releases him from Giuffre’s claims against him. But Christensen said: “I don’t see how any person could fit within that definition without there being a second agreement that specifically names individuals.” Eric Baum, an attorney representing a woman in civil sexual misconduct claims against the American Apparel founder, Dov Charney, and restaurateur Mario Batali, said Prince Andrew and his legal team were “grasping at straws”. “They have concocted a baseless defense to serious allegations of sexual assault,” he said. “Prince Andrew’s lawyers are attempting to rely on a settlement agreement that was entered into between Epstein and Ms Giuffre in a different court. “Prince Andrew was not a party in that case, was not mentioned by name in the release and has not provided anything in return for the release he seeks to use. In essence, Prince Andrew’s legal team’s argument would let any individual who commits a wrongdoing against Ms Giuffre off the hook because of the release she signed with Epstein.” Others were less certain that the Epstein settlement does not cover Andrew, since it was made years after alleged assaults which Giuffre would have had in mind when she and her lawyers agreed to the “potential defendant” language. Julie Rendelman, a New York criminal defence lawyer, said: “The question is, when she’s signing this agreement with Epstein she would have been well aware that Prince Andrew would have been one of the potential respondents in a civil lawsuit, and she chose to go forward with it. “She would have known full well that he could be articulated as being included in that.” At the end of last week, there was a sense that criminal prosecutions arising from Epstein’s behaviour could end with the conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell, his former girlfriend, on sex-trafficking charges. On Tuesday, Judge Kaplan said he would decide “soon” if the civil case against Prince Andrew should be dismissed. But Christensen, of Wigdor, doubted that the affair was close to an end. “I don’t think it’s over, and that’s partly because Epstein is becoming an even bigger issue in my own litigation,” she said. For a New York attorney, Christensen added, it was hard to fathom why the Giuffre-Prince Andrew lawsuit had not been settled. “I can’t believe they haven’t gotten rid of it already. I don’t get it, but then we don’t have a monarchy. It’s a head-scratcher that it’s ongoing to the degree that it is.”",News/UK news,Can the Virginia Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein deal protect Prince Andrew?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/prince-andrew-virginia-giuffre-jeffrey-epstein-deal
1/5/2022,"As the bells chimed one o’clock in the City of London on Tuesday, the typical lunchtime exodus from the offices in the capital’s financial district was barely a trickle. A handful of workers left the Bank of England on Threadneedle Street on their lunch breaks, but most of the scattering of people were dressed for a day shopping or sightseeing rather than sitting behind their desks.  In normal times, Tuesday would have marked the first day back in the workplace after the Christmas festivities for millions of the nation’s office-based employees. Despite data suggesting that the Omicron Covid-19 variant is less severe than other versions of the virus, coupled with figures indicating that cases in the capital have stabilised, staff at most large offices appeared to be continuing to work from home. The morning rush hour in London remained well below pre-pandemic levels, according to data from Transport for London. Before 10am on Tuesday morning, TfL reported about 770,000 taps on its buses and about 710,000 entry and exits across the tube network, representing significantly fewer passengers than seen when workers returned in January 2020. Then, about 6m daily trips were made by bus, and 4m by tube. Those commuting to the capital have had to wrestle with severely curtailed services, with all Southern trains to and from London Victoria cancelled until 10 January as a result of pandemic-related staffing shortages, and services reduced across the network. Scotrail has cut about 8% (160) of its services from the 2,000 trains it runs normally. Figures from the satnav maker TomTom showed morning rush hour congestion on roads in city centres including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow and Cardiff remained at half the levels seen at in early January 2020, before the UK pandemic, or even lower. Most of the workers who had nipped out at lunchtime in the City to buy a sandwich or to stretch their legs said they had come to the office to do specific tasks, or because they preferred it to working from home. A financial services worker, Sam Lowres, 23, walking back to the office at the end of his lunch break, had been surprised by how quiet the City was. An employee at the Aquis Exchange, Lowres has only been worked in the district for six months since graduating from university last summer. He said he much preferred working from his desk, where he had a better computer set-up. “I live in a small flat. There is more space to work in the office and a separation from home,” he said. “Lots of places are encouraging working from home until at least the end of January.” Walking past the Royal Exchange, Patrick Tomlinson, the head of business continuity and crisis management at the investment bank Rothschild & Co, said he had to complete some work that could only be done in the office, and was taking advantage of a quiet workplace. “I can come in later to avoid peak travel time. The company has a flexible approach,” he said, adding that the firm was monitoring Covid data to decide how to proceed. The solicitors Gorkem Ozsoy and Caryn Toh said their work required them to be in the office at least some of the time, whether meeting clients or preparing for in-person court hearings. “The nature of the job doesn’t allow working from home all the time,” said Ozsoy. “Initially everyone worked from home for the first six months [of the pandemic]. Now everyone has had enough, or wants to return.” Toh added: “We have to prepare court bundles and I usually prefer to be in the office for that.” When the government once again tightened its coronavirus guidance in early December, urging office-based staff in England to work from home where possible, many large corporates decided to take a more flexible approach than earlier in the pandemic. Large office-based businesses including the insurance firms Legal & General and Aviva are among those who have decided to keep their office buildings open. Aviva, which has a 16,000-strong workforce in the UK, said staff who could not work from home for any reason could attend its offices. L&G said it was keeping its offices and cafes open for any of its 7,000 UK employees “who cannot work effectively from home”, including those who need to work in the office for their mental wellbeing. Inside the City’s historic Leadenhall Market, many of the grab-and-go sandwich shops and coffee bars, which in pre-Covid times would have expected queues out of the door most lunchtimes, remained shuttered. Some had stuck handwritten signs in the window, stating they would reopen the following week, while others gave no indication when they would return. A beauty therapist, Sue Durrant, based at the Chequers hair and beauty salon in the covered market, said she had seen just one customer on Tuesday. “It’s the first day back and I’ve got no one else booked in,” she said. “It’s been really quiet and everyone seems to be working from home. It’s really damaging for the City.”",News/Business,‘It’s damaging for the City’: post-holiday London streets stay quiet,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/its-damaging-for-the-city-post-holiday-london-streets-stay-quiet
1/5/2022,"The first time I walked up Mount Owen, I horrified my boyfriend by curling up beneath one of its famous water-riven karst outcrops and insisting I needed to sleep. We’d broken up six months before, and had just gotten back together to give it another go. That morning, we were both questioning our life choices. The previous day had been fine – a decent seven hours of walking, climbing a ridge through mountain beech, sidling along a rocky cliff streaming with water, and clambering up a dry riverbed to Granity Pass Hut, a simple 12-bunk alpine hut just past the treeline.  But we’d bickered all morning as the sun rose behind us and we hiked up the massif towards the summit, through the bronzed alpine meadow known as the Hay Paddock, past still mountain tarns reflecting the sky. It was beautiful, but I was getting slower and grumpier, and finally announced I needed a lie-down in the tussock. He looked at me, aghast. He really wanted to get to the top – at 1,875 metres, Mt Owen is the highest point in Kahurangi National Park, which covers the north-western corner of the top of New Zealand’s South Island. The views are majestic. I no longer cared. “Go,” I said, waving weakly from my spot beneath the sun-warmed rock. “It’s sunny. I’ll wait here. I’m fine. I’m just so tired.” He stood over me, considering. “This is not a place to nap,” he said, and hauled me up like a cast ruminant and prodded me towards the top. You do need your wits about you on the glaciated marble karst of Mt Owen. Full of slots and holes, its insides are riven with caves, some of the longest in the world. To get to the top, you have to spend a couple of hours hopping from rock to rock across sharply carved cracks. A fall would require surgery or a body bag, and like all of New Zealand, the weather can change suddenly. Eventually, I made it. I collapsed on the smooth grey rock and watched other trampers bound about taking pictures. I lay on my pack and stared into the layers of bluish mountain ranges, hazy in the January summer heat as my boyfriend grimly prepared himself to spend the rest of the day coaxing me back down to the car, imagining lots of pack-carrying and whining. But on the way back down, I came right – and when we were sorting out our rubbish at the carpark, I realised what had happened. The freeze-dried meal I’d had for breakfast, a product sample from a friend, had actually contained two servings of high-energy scrambled eggs, bacon and hollandaise – about 1,600 calories. No wonder I was comatose; I’d had a Christmas dinner’s worth of rehydrated eggs before trying to stagger to the summit. I showed him the packet, and he just shook his head.

1/5/2022,"Attempts to press ahead with the forthcoming European fixtures have been dealt a fresh blow after it emerged South African players based in the UK face further red tape to gain entry into France with the Sale director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, saying the Champions Cup could be made into a “mockery”. European Professional Club Rugby, organisers of the Champions Cup and Challenge Cup, remain in discussions over two rounds of fixtures this month after matches were postponed in December when France limited entry from the UK to “essential only”. EPCR is hopeful of gaining the necessary exemptions to allow fixtures to go ahead.  On Tuesday, Sanderson revealed a further complication, however, with Sale’s South African players facing additional visa requirements. It is understood EPCR is aware of the problem, though its priority remains getting the fixtures played in the first place. Sanderson, though, is adamant Sale would not be able to field a competitive side away to Clermont on 16 January if his South African contingent cannot travel and said they were not the only club to raise the issue. In addition, the French government has mandated that all sportspeople be fully vaccinated from 15 January, which would further reduce the number of players available to Sanderson. “There’s a certain type of visa you get if you’re South African, which has to be approved,” he said. “They’d have to fast-track and approve these Schengen visas in record time. Apparently it’s only a stamp but it’s out of our hands. “This is entirely in the lap of European Rugby and their ability to push it through and then the French government to approve it. It doesn’t give us a competitive team. There are nine of our squad who wouldn’t be approved and that’s not even including some of the lads who aren’t double-jabbed, of which there’s one or two. We’re not the only ones, we’re all in a similar boat.” Asked about fielding a second-string side if his South African players are not granted exemption, Sanderson said: “It’s a mockery of the cup then, isn’t it? We’re in it to play the best teams with our best team. So no, I wouldn’t even consider taking a second team to Clermont to get beaten up.” Even if EPCR receives the green light for this month’s fixtures, when to replay those postponed last month has not been resolved. “I do think [the tournament] is in trouble, not through its own fault,” Sanderson said. “We have all had to deal internally with Covid and all the issues and curveballs that come up because of it. There is no space in the season to reschedule these games. There is none so how do you continue with the tournament in its old structure? I can’t see how you can if we can’t field our best team to come to France or the game isn’t played.”",Sport/Sport,"Travel red tape risks making ‘mockery’ of Champions Cup, warns Sanderson",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/04/european-club-competitions-in-trouble-over-covid-and-visas
1/5/2022,"Liverpool have requested the postponement of their Carabao Cup semi‑final at Arsenal on Thursday after further positive tests for Covid-19 at the club. The club submitted the request to the EFL on Tuesday having cancelled a planned training session in response to a rising number of positive tests, other illnesses and injuries.  Jürgen Klopp, three members of his staff and three players – Alisson, Roberto Firmino and Joël Matip – missed the draw at Chelsea on Sunday having tested positive. The Liverpool manager has mild symptoms but is fine, according to the club. Nine Liverpool players were missing at Stamford Bridge on Sunday as a consequence of Covid, injuries and suspension, and Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané and Naby Keïta have subsequently reported for the Africa Cup of Nations. Further positive tests on Tuesday prompted Liverpool to request the postponement. The club are awaiting a decision from the EFL and face more problems with the fixture schedule should the request be granted. The Carabao Cup final is scheduled to take place on 27 February and there is limited midweek availability for a rearranged game before that time. Klopp has stated he would prefer the semi-final to be decided over one leg. “The Reds have formally requested to the EFL that the fixture is rescheduled after further suspected positive tests were registered among players and staff, allied to other factors impacting selection, including illness and injury,” said Liverpool, referring to positive lateral flow tests, with PCR results awaited. “In response, the club halted preparations at the AXA Training Centre, meaning Tuesday’s first‑team training session was cancelled. Among the considerations which led to today’s application to the EFL is the need for travelling supporters to be given as much notice as possible of any potential postponement. “With no prospect of the current situation improving ahead of Thursday’s fixture and the potential for it to worsen, the club considers it both prudent and reasonable to ask for the fixture to be rescheduled.” The EFL said the request would “be considered in accordance with the competition rules as set out at the start of the season alongside information submitted by the club” and a decision would be confirmed as soon as possible.",Sport/Football,Liverpool request Carabao Cup semi-final postponement after more Covid cases,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/04/liverpool-request-carabao-cup-semi-final-arsenal-postponement-covid-efl
1/5/2022,"“Iwant to put down the best possible race I can,” says Cornelius Kersten, the first British long-track speed skater to make a Winter Olympics in 30 years. “To get the official word a few days ago was like a weight falling off the shoulders. It’s official now, it’s actually going to happen and it feels amazing. My ambition is now to be there in the best shape of my life.” The history of British Olympic speed skating is hardly voluminous, one bronze medal in the history of the Games being the extent of it. Of late, Elise Christie has helped to burnish the national reputation in the short-track form, with the Scot winning world and European titles, but the long track – the icy equivalent of a track cycling time trial – has been out of reach for these temperate isles for a generation.  Kersten qualifies after a number of personal bests in the World Cup series last year and will compete in the 1000m and 1500m events. His success comes after years of dedication and development, often without any official funding, and he’s grown alongside his partner, fellow British speed skater Ellia Smeding. They share a passion and a business but also a location, one that in speed skating is worth almost half a second in itself: the Netherlands. Speed skating’s pre-eminent nation, there is a Wikipedia page dedicated to Dutch records in the sport. Kersten’s father is Dutch and also a passionate skater, one who completed the Elfstedentocht; a 200km, 11-city race that hasn’t been staged since 1994 because it has never been cold enough. Raised in the Netherlands, Kersten has absorbed that Dutch culture – “people are very into it and they’ve been doing it for centuries and most people think they know best” – and is also part of Heerenveen’s Team Worldstream Correndon, known as the NXTGN and marketed like a team of eSport professionals. Yet Kersten says he skates like a Briton. “How me and El go at it is [not to say] we know best but: ‘OK, what can we learn’.” And when he came to the last year of his career as a youth skater, he chose to represent the country of his mother. “I had the option to compete for the Netherlands, but I switched,” he says, citing the influence of Stephen Airey, the man who helped to build the British long-track programme and continues to work as its development manager in a voluntary capacity. “He was the one who gave us the room to grow and I’d always wanted to represent Team GB, so it became a really easy decision to make,” Kersten says. Smeding shares a similar biography, and the pair have been living together in Heerenveen, round the corner from the Thialf ice arena, and skating for the past three years. That skating has often been at night, however, as during the day the pair are busy roasting, packaging and shipping coffee beans. Brew ’22 is the name of the couple’s company and it has been a success, generating funds that have allowed them to continue competing, with Karsten only otherwise qualifying for IOC solidarity funding. Karsten says he would not recommend running a business to any other active athlete. “Coffee is my passion and Brew is our little baby so it’s very easy to put a lot of time and effort into it, but it does sometimes take time and energy when you would rather have a nap in the afternoon.” His preferred drink is a filter coffee and he would like to convert others to the more subtle flavours of a pour-over brew. But before that he would like to give long-track skating a kickstart in the UK. “I think the sport needs to grow and we need more recognition. I’d like to inspire people to get involved and hopefully get a track in the UK. At the moment we’re a small sport, and I hope the Games will help that.” Long-track skating is a sport that has finally come in from the cold and while Kersten is unlikely to return from Beijing with a medal, he makes for an effective ambassador. What, in the end, does he love the most about his discipline? “For me that’s the speed of it. When you throw yourself into a corner at 40mph you’re in control but you’re also slightly out of control too. One wrong move and you’re out, you’re flying into the cushions. But if you hit it right, you absolutely blast through … and that’s amazing.”",Sport/Sport,"Cornelius Kersten, the speed skater who has ended Team GB’s long wait",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/04/cornelius-kersten-the-speed-skater-who-has-ended-team-gbs-long-wait
1/5/2022,"An Eritrean asylum seeker who killed himself shortly after his 18th birthday was worried about his application to remain in the UK and was traumatised by the recent suicide of a close friend, another Eritrean asylum seeker, an inquest has heard. The examination of the circumstances leading to the death of Alexander Tekle is the fourth inquest to be heard into the suicides of four Eritreans within a 16-month period. Collectively, the inquests have put a spotlight on how young, unaccompanied asylum seekers are looked after by local authorities on arrival in the UK.  Tekle killed himself on 6 December 2017, a few weeks after his friend Filmon Yemane was found dead. Friends told the inquest that Tekle was profoundly traumatised by experiences he had in Eritrea that had prompted him to flee, and also by the long and dangerous journey he had made to the UK. He was violently attacked in Calais, and arrived in Britain hidden in a refrigerated lorry in December 2016. Tekle told his first social worker in Kent that he was having trouble sleeping and had nightmares, but the social worker did not make detailed inquiries into what was causing this. Over the 12 months he was in the UK, Tekle became homeless and was seriously injured in a stabbing. He started drinking heavily, and friends told the inquest they believed this was a way of dealing with the trauma he had experienced. Tekle gave the wrong date of birth on arrival in the UK, and spent months trying to correct the error. As a consequence of the mistake, he was registered as older than he was. He was quickly transferred to adult refugee services and was no longer eligible for some of the specialist, child-focused support he may otherwise have received. Solicitors asked his social worker in Kent, where he was originally placed before he was deemed to have turned 18, whether there had been a reluctance to fix the mistaken age in order to minimise the period during which the council was responsible for his wellbeing. The social worker denied that this had been a factor in the decision not to exercise discretion and accept the evidence provided by Tekle indicating that he was younger. Benjamin Hunter, a volunteer who had met Tekle in Calais when he was living in the camp there, tried repeatedly to alert officials who were working with him to Tekle’s deteriorating mental health. Addressing the inquest by phone from Sudan, speaking with the assistance of an interpreter, Tekle’s father said his son was loving and caring, had many friends, a good sense of humour and a passion for cycling. “I hoped that he would be safe in the UK, build his life there, go to college, study and one day get married and have his own children,” Tecle Tesfamichel said. “If anything can come from this tragedy, I hope that lessons can be learned to prevent this from happening to another young person. Alex has gone, we can never bring him back, but I don’t want another young person to go through what he did.” Friends paid tribute to Tekle. “He was the nicest person that I have ever met. He had so much charisma,” Sham Aklilu said in a statement read out to the inquest. Tekle was the second of four Eritrean refugees, all friends, to kill themselves. Filmon Yemane had recently turned 18 when he took his life in November 2017. Osman Ahmed Nur, 19, was found dead on 10 May 2018 in a communal area of a young people’s hostel in Camden, north London. Mulubrhane Medhane Kfleyosus, 19, was found dead on 18 February 2019 in Milton Keynes. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

1/5/2022,"There are grounds to hope that cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant may already have peaked in some areas, including London, and also that the cumulative damage of the disease it causes will turn out to be less than in the more alarming scenarios described by scientists. But as pupils and teachers return to school, there remains cause for serious concern. It is unsurprising, based on the experience of the past two years, that the education department’s latest measures appear closer to a sticking-plaster than a strategy. But this does not make it acceptable. The publication of an open letter from the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, 48 hours before many schools were due to reopen, and the sudden announcement that 7,000 air purifiers would be available for classrooms, smack of homework left until the end of the holidays. Aspects of the regime that has been imposed until the end of January in England, with mandatory mask-wearing in secondary classrooms and recommended twice-weekly testing, are sensible (the devolved administrations have their own arrangements, with masks already in place in Scottish high schools, for example). Ministers are right to make a priority of keeping schools open. Also welcome is the reframed guidance about the vulnerable children who must be regarded as one of the state’s most urgent responsibilities, in the event of further closures. An increase in child abuse was a predictable consequence of the pandemic, and more should have been done to help social services cope; following devastating evidence in cases including the murder of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, ministers have belatedly acted on some of the risks.  The suggestion that classes should double up, or that non-teaching staff might take charge of lessons, however, is more likely to alienate teachers than reassure them. Mr Zahawi’s reference to the “blitz spirit”, and the MP Jonathan Gullis’s cheery approval of a “teach army” of volunteers, were presumably aimed at boosting morale. But two years into a pandemic, with many parts of England still waiting for Omicron cases to spike, and ventilation issues unresolved (with open windows not a straightforward solution in colder periods or areas), the government would do better to focus on meaningful engagement with teachers and their unions than to issue nostalgic calls to arms. Headteachers and schools have stepped up, under Covid, working extremely hard to minimise the disruption not only to children’s education but also to their lives. But with workforce recruitment and retention already known to be a serious problem for schools, as it is in the NHS, there are real worries that the pressures of the pandemic – including the threat to health for those required to spend all day in buildings with large numbers of unvaccinated people – could make a difficult situation worse. GCSE and A-level examinations are only a few months off. Finding a fair way to manage these, despite inevitable interruptions and without exaggerating existing divisions (such as between private and state schools), will be hard. Useful work could also be done via schools in relation to vaccine misinformation and encouraging uptake, particularly in cities where it is low. The Treasury must provide additional resources to meet costs such as emergency cover for absences. Ministers and officials at the Department for Education should be mindful that, as in a foreign language test, listening to teachers is as important as speaking to them.",News/Education,The Guardian view on Covid and schools: crossed fingers aren’t enough | Editorial ,https://www.theguardian.com/education/commentisfree/2022/jan/04/the-guardian-view-on-covid-and-schools-crossed-fingers-arent-enough
1/5/2022,"Even before global energy prices began to soar last spring, too many people in Britain could not afford to keep their homes warm in a cold winter. This year – amid a wider cost-of-living crisis driven by high inflation, a looming rise in national insurance and stagnating wages – spiralling heating bills threaten to tip the household budgets of millions over the edge. According to calculations by the charity National Energy Action, six million families risk becoming fuel poor by the spring, when the energy price cap is expected to be significantly raised. This would be the highest number since such records began to be kept in 1996. The bottom line of this crisis, for those at its sharp end, could not be more stark. Rishi Sunak’s culpably shortsighted decision to remove the universal credit uplift in the autumn stripped £20 a week from the bank accounts of the poor. In the absence of expanded fuel subsidies from the government, more and more of Britain’s less well-off families will be forced into desperate, humiliating choices between food, warmth and other essentials. Parents will go without to make sure their children eat a decent meal. Unheated homes will lead to greater ill health, while higher debt will bring spiralling levels of stress and anxiety.  To mitigate this, the secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, Kwasi Kwarteng, who meets the UK’s major energy suppliers this week, needs a plan that is morally fit for purpose. As Labour’s leader, Keir Starmer, has pointed out, the government could by now have cut VAT on energy bills, offering some relief to consumers. A mooted £20bn state loan to the major energy companies may help to flatten the curve of rising prices. But given that the rise in the price cap in April could be as much as 50%, the government urgently needs to show some pre-emptive empathy and solidarity with those who will disproportionately suffer the consequences. Options are available. As National Energy Action has recommended, eligibility for the winter fuel allowance should no longer be restricted to pensioners but include all on low incomes. The warm home discount scheme could be expanded, and Treasury funds used to alleviate the levels of debt accrued by hard-pressed families through no fault of their own. Some of the money for this could come from a windfall tax on North Sea gas producers, who are making record profits as a result of the crisis; the government’s own VAT and booming carbon tax receipts could also be deployed. In the longer term, this crisis should be the final wake-up call when it comes to dealing with the chronic levels of energy inefficiency in so many British homes. A joined-up, properly financed plan to insulate and retrofit social housing to make it zero-carbon would significantly reduce household bills for the poor, reduce emissions and act as a catalyst for wider transformation. Yet in the autumn budget, Mr Sunak chose to halve the money available for a home upgrade grant targeted at improving energy efficiency in fuel-poor homes, while the failed green homes grant scheme has dented industry confidence. Dealing with the coming energy crunch will require imagination, fiscal generosity and a recognition that – in a market that risks becoming unsustainably dysfunctional – state intervention is to be embraced rather than avoided. Sadly, with this government, that may be too much to ask.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on soaring energy bills: the less well-off need a new deal | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/04/the-guardian-view-on-soaring-energy-bills-the-less-well-off-need-a-new-deal
