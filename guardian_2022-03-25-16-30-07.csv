3/25/2022,"The Olympic Games were reborn in Much Wenlock. It was over dinner at the Raven coaching inn in 1890 that pioneering doctor William Penny Brookes and French aristocrat Baron Pierre de Coubertin had a discussion about reviving the ancient Greek competitions. You can still see a copy of their menu here, which featured pigeon pie, grapes and pineapples. The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens six years later. Brookes had founded the Wenlock Olympian Society decades earlier, to promote the moral, physical and intellectual benefits of exercise, and first staged games here in 1850. The original events included quoits, cricket, and cycling on penny farthings. Every July the little medieval town still holds the Wenlock Olympian Games, now in their 136th year (one of the official mascots at London 2012 was called Wenlock as a tribute).

Start The Raven, Much Wenlock, ShropshireDistance 6.2 milesTime 2½ hoursTotal ascent 266 metresDifficulty Moderate There’s a 1.3 mile-long Olympian Trail marked by bronze circles in the pavement and related displays in the museum, which I take in on my way to hike along Wenlock Edge. It passes Brookes’ house on Wilmore Street and a memorial, with a metal torch above it, on the playing fields. The inscription reads: “His imagination a worldwide inspiration.” The trail runs along the High Street past the George & Dragon, ideal for a post-hike pint, and wanders round the corner to the Raven in Barrow Street. The old inn is now a 2 AA Rosette restaurant with rooms, a good place in which to eat and sleep. It sells walking maps, does takeaway sandwiches and has a shop attached, Raven Marketplace, which opened during lockdown 2020. Wenlock Edge, a limestone escarpment above Much Wenlock, with views of Long Mynd and the Stretton hills, offers an array of woodland walks. But I start with a loop round the town’s Olympic sights and ruined medieval priory, originally founded as an abbey by King Merewalh, ruler of part of Mercia, in the seventh century. Merewalh’s daughter Milburge was Wenlock’s second abbess and her relics began to attract pilgrims. Today the walls of an intricately carved Norman chapter house and towering 13th-century church stand picturesquely craggy under peaceful Scots pines. I follow a winding lane out of town past the priory and head back along a sunken tree-lined track that is part of the Shropshire Way, a 200-mile walk around the county. It passes Linden Field, ringed by avenues of lime trees, close to the site of the first Wenlock Games. On a hill above is the brick tower of an old windmill, struck by lightning in 1850; there were ticketed seats around the hillside below the windmill, a natural amphitheatre for watching the games. Walking back across Wilmore Street and along a couple of suburban roads, I am soon heading westwards out of town towards Wenlock Edge. The novelist Henry James walked here in the 1870s. The ruined priory influenced his gothic landscapes in The Turn of the Screw and the glacially slow novel The Princess Casamassima, in which the young revolutionary Hyacinth walks among thatched cottages and blue distances, “the green dimness of leafy lanes” and “meadow paths that led from stile to stile … the hedges thick with flowers.” The Shropshire Way leads through Wenlock Quarry and up on to a grassy embankment. There are ivy-draped limestone cliffs, the stone from which much of the town is built. Fossilised seashells and hints of coral and trilobites are embedded in the rock. There’s a geological epoch in the Silurian period named Wenlock after this limestone. Reaching the leafy slopes of Wenlock Edge, a wide track winds through coppiced hazels with a multitude of waymarks. “Blakeway Hollow” says one wooden post, pointing down a narrow path. The name evokes dark sunken roads. The National Trust outlines a simpler, less adventurous route and describes Blakeway Hollow as an “old packhorse route” from Much Wenlock to Shrewsbury. At this point the old lane becomes a deep, stony gully that feels like a dried-up riverbed, slanting down the wooded hillside. The banks are a jungle of hart’s-tongue ferns and bracken with hedge maples, hawthorn, oak, beech and silver birch tangling their branches overhead. At the foot of the hill, there are glimpses through the trees of sunlit peaks beyond, but I need to follow the path through the shadow of the woods if I want to get back before nightfall. I head back to Much Wenlock along the Jack Mytton Way, named after a Regency MP who left Westminster, bored, after only half an hour. Nicknamed “Mad Jack”, Mytton often hunted naked despite owning thousands of hunting outfits, dressed up as a highwayman to fool his own guests, cured his hiccups by setting fire to his shirt, jumped his horse over a dinner table, turned to drink, and died of gangrene and alcohol withdrawal in a debtors’ prison. Climbing through the woods on Mad Jack’s trail is more than worth the effort for the view from the top, 1,000ft above sea level, over the limestone lip of the escarpment across a pastoral tapestry of patchwork fields and ancient hedges. The next viewpoint is known as Major’s Leap. A royalist major called Thomas Smallman, cornered by roundheads, galloped off the top of Wenlock Edge to his seemingly certain doom. The horse died, but the major lived (saved by an apple tree) to deliver vital messages to the King’s army. The view is extraordinary: Caer Caradoc and other volcanic Shropshire hills form a misty backdrop to miles of fields. As I head downhill towards the George & Dragon, a horse, framed by yellow hedge maple leaves, watches me over a gate and the clifftop beeches glow fiery gold in the setting sun. From its dog-friendly tiled floor to its old beamed ceiling, the George & Dragon, on the high street in the middle of Much Wenlock, is every inch a traditional pub. A few years back it was shut until an enthusiastic team rescued it; Ben and Kate Stanford have been landlords since April 2021. There are wooden settles, open fires and real ales like citrussy Hereford Pale Ale from the Wye Valley Brewery and floral-hoppy Shropshire Gold from Salopian. There’s homemade food, too; epic Sunday lunches and, during lockdowns, the pub supplied thousands of takeaways.thebestpubintheworld.com The Raven, just round the corner, has a jumble of old buildings around a courtyard. Besides a gourmet restaurant, there’s a crowd-pleasing lounge menu featuring fish finger sandwiches and barbecue chicken wings. The spectacular Coach House has a woodburner in the sitting room downstairs with the bed on a mezzanine floor above, under a high beamed ceiling.

Marc has dissociative identity disorder and lives his life in a near-constant state of confusion and distress. Who is he? In addition to his sideline in dispensing justice and vengeance, at various points he’s a New York taxi driver, a meek gift shop employee and the representative on Earth of the Egyptian moon god Khonshu (voiced by F Murray Abraham). A heady psychological thriller, realised with pace and invention, and animated by Isaac’s compellingly jittery and tormented central performance.Disney+, from Wednesday 30 March “Only screw-ups get sent to Slough House.” Based on the 2010 novel of the same name by Mick Herron, this six-part thriller is set in the rambling dumping ground of MI5 outcasts no longer in the game. Located in Regent’s Park, Slough House is a dingy realm, patrolled by Jackson Lamb (an enjoyably raddled Gary Oldman), a shambling but brilliant spy presiding over his discredited team.

However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has shown him to be a man of incredible courage and substance. But how was his acting? Netflix is giving us another chance to decide, re-platforming this comedy satire in which Zelenskiy stars as, believe it or not, a teacher who becomes president of Ukraine. It’s solid enough telly on its own terms. The context, though, makes it truly head-spinning.Netflix, out now A manga-style, time-travelling animation comedy-drama about bathhouse architecture? Never let it be said that Netflix doesn’t cater to the niche. This series is adapted from Mari Yamazaki’s original comics – and indeed, Yamazaki has taken care of the composition work here. It tells the story of Lucius (voiced by Kenjiro Tsuda), tasked with building a luxurious bathhouse in ancient Rome but disappearing down a plughole (literally) and finding himself materialising in the spa rooms of both modern and ancient Japan. Inventive and eccentric.Netflix, from Monday 28 March “When we think of a criminal mastermind – someone who is devious, calculating and cunning – what we don’t think of is a geeky 24-year-old,” says the narrator of this startling documentary. But in an era of multiple online identities and crypto-scams, geeky 24-year-olds are the apex predators. Gerry Cotten, founder of QuadrigaCX – at one point, Canada’s largest crypto exchange – died in 2018 while travelling in India. He took the company’s passwords – behind which lay a cool $190m in investments – with him to the grave.

3/25/2022,"Phones and pens at the ready: Thursday 31 March will be “national meter reading day”. With energy bills due to rise by an average of 54% on Friday 1 April, millions of households are being urged to take gas and electricity meter readings the day before. The aim is to ensure you get the current, cheaper rates for all the energy you use right up until close of play on Thursday. Otherwise your supplier might charge some of it at the new higher unit prices. Gareth Kloet, the energy spokesperson at the comparison site GoCompare, says: “We would urge all bill payers to take both gas and electricity meter readings on 31 March and make sure you submit these to your supplier.” Money-saving guru Martin Lewis is encouraging people to do the same, to “draw a line” in terms of their usage. If everyone does that, on Thursday there are likely to be a lot more people than usual phoning the energy companies and logging on to their websites. EDF, one of the big energy suppliers, told Guardian Money: “We expect a lot of customers might try to contact us with meter readings on 31 March and would recommend anyone who can to submit a meter reading online – via our website, in MyAccount or our app, which are all available 24/7. “This will help keep our phone lines free for those who might need additional or urgent support, and mean customers can avoid waiting on the phone.” This advice is likely to apply to customers of other suppliers too. There are often lots of ways you can submit a reading: online or via the supplier’s app, and maybe also via online chat or by sending a text. If you have a smart meter, you will probably know that these send automated readings to your energy supplier. However, depending on how it is set up, your meter may not automatically send a reading on 31 March. That’s because in many cases the system will be set up to send a reading on a set date once a month. But you should be able to change the settings – some meters can take readings every half hour – or, failing that, log into your account and submit your reading that way. British Gas told us that its smart meters take readings at set times determined by the customer, but there is nothing to stop them logging in and submitting an additional one on 31 March. There are about 4.5m households with a prepayment meter, and many will be old-style “non-smart” ones. If you have one, MoneySavingExpert points out that you may be able effectively to delay the coming price rises and keep the cheaper rates for a little longer. It says that’s because, according to Ofgem, the price customers pay is fixed at the point they top up. This means any built-up credit is spent based on the price of energy when that credit was added. So you should seriously consider adding as much credit as you can afford before 1 April. Though there will be limits on how much you can add. For example, SSE Energy Services says its meters will only hold up to £250 credit in total. If, for whatever reason, you have a problem trying to submit your readings, take photos on the day that clearly show them and the meter serial numbers.",Lifestyle/Money,Energy bills: read your meter on 31 March before prices rise,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/25/energy-bills-read-meter-31-march-prices-rise
3/25/2022,"The crisis in the UK childcare sector has been laid bare by two major surveys, with campaigners saying young families and struggling providers are being ignored by ministers as the cost of living crisis spirals. Both surveys suggest childcare fees are increasing to an unmanageable level, with two-thirds of 27,000 parents reporting rising childcare costs in the past six months, and a similar percentage of providers confirming increases. Two-thirds of respondents to the survey published by the campaign groups Pregnant Then Screwed and Mumsnet, said they were paying as much or more for their childcare than for their rent or mortgage. Almost half (43%) of working mothers were considering leaving their jobs and 40% were working fewer hours than they wanted to because childcare fees were unaffordable. A separate survey of 1,970 childcare providers by the Early Years Alliance found 72% of providers said government funding for two-year-olds did not cover costs, while 86% said funding for three- to four-year-olds was insufficient. Only 57% of local authorities report there are sufficient places available for children under two. Pressure has been mounting on the government to address the crippling costs. A petition calling for an independent review of funding and affordability gathered 113,713 signatures and triggered a debate in parliament. But on International Women’s Day signatories were told the government had no plans to carry out a review. The parent survey provides further evidence of the cost of living crisis. Low earners are being hit the hardest, with 16% of households with an income of less than £25,000 saying bills had doubled, compared with 7% of those with a household income of more than £150,000. One in four parents said they have had to cut down on necessities such as food, heating or clothing to afford childcare, a figure that increases to 48% of young parents and 53% of single parents. Among childcare providers, 87% reported increases in electricity and gas bills, while just less than a third were operating at a loss and 75% said they expected to use financial reserves this year. Joeli Brearley, founder of Pregnant Then Screwed, accused the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, of ignoring the plight of young families after he did not mention the cost of childcare in his spring statement. “The government says they want to support hardworking families, but families don’t work without childcare,” she said. “It is beyond frustrating that childcare is being ignored time and time again.” The group is encouraging mothers to use the hashtag #UnHappyMothersDay to raise awareness among politicians of the difficulties working parents face, in particular mothers. The survey, which was self-selecting, found that 80% of parents expected the cost of childcare to increase in the next six months, with 99% saying it was exacerbating the cost of living crisis and 65% reporting high anxiety because of money worries. The parents surveyed said they had reduced spending in other areas, with 69% cutting back on non-essentials, while 2% said they had resorted to using food banks, rising to 5% of black parents, 6% of young parents and 13% of single parents. In the childcare sector almost half of respondents (48%) said they were thinking about leaving; three-quarters had not had a pay increase in two years. Justine Roberts, CEO of Mumsnet, said the survey was further proof that childcare in the UK was broken. “For many families, childcare is either expensive to the point of being unusable or unavailable at the times they need,” she said. A government spokesperson said: “The early years of a child’s life are the most crucial, which is why we have invested more than £3.5bn in each of the last three years to deliver the free childcare offers, including the 30 hours per week for working parents. We are also investing millions in Family Hubs, where families can access important support services. To support working families more widely, we also recently announced the biggest ever increase in the national living wage since its introduction, from April 2022.” When Romilly Cole and her fiance calculated how much their childcare was going to cost while planning her return to work, she could not believe it. “To have [our daughter] in childcare full-time, we were looking at £1,200 a month, which after tax was £150 less than I was earning. If you factor in another £160 for after-school club for my eldest it just didn’t add up. I’d be working full-time and have nothing to pay the rest of the bills,” she said. With a heavy heart she gave up her job at a local car dealership in the Isle of Wight, where her brother also works and where her father, too, had been employed before his death. “I didn’t want to stop working but it just made no sense for me to carry on. It’s madness, it’s just absolute madness,” she said. Cole now worries about the effect on her pension and her family’s financial situation as the cost of living crisis bites – as well as noting that the government has lost her tax revenue. She added: “We have a lot of sleepless night but we try and be positive for the kids. I know loads of friends who can’t work for the same reason – I just don’t know how any normal family is meant to afford it.”",Lifestyle/Money,"Childcare costs have spiralled for two-thirds of UK parents, survey shows",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/25/childcare-costs-spiralled-uk-families-survey
3/25/2022,"A new driest year in British history has been found after a massive project in which thousands of volunteer citizen scientists helped unearth Victorian climate data. Millions of archived handwritten rainfall records dating back 130 years have now been transcribed and analysed, thanks to the work of volunteers during the first coronavirus lockdown. That work has resulted in new findings, including that 1855 is now the driest year on record, with just 786.5mm of rain. It was previously thought to be 1933. Many noticed that May 2020 was particularly dry, and it was indeed believed to be the driest month on record for many regions and England as a whole. But the new data shifts the record back to May 1844, when only 8.3mm of rain fell in England. The project, led by the University of Reading, gave 16,000 people on furlough, or who could not work for other reasons, something important to do with their time. The volunteers diligently digitised 5.2m observations in just 16 days, and these have now been made available in the official Met Office record, both expanding the data they had for existing years and extending the dataset by 26 years, to 1836. Jacqui Huntley, a volunteer based near Stranraer in Dumfries and Galloway, said: “I got involved because I’m British and therefore a fanatic about the weather, especially rain. And it rains a lot where I live in Scotland. The data are obviously valuable to scientists, but I have also loved learning about the rainfall observers who were so dedicated in measuring the weather day after day. It has been fun, and a true team effort, from start to finish.” The records also revealed how many people became involved in volunteer meteorology during the particularly damp winter of 1852. December 1852 was found to be the third wettest month on record for Cumbria, with 364.9mm of rainfall, and November 1852 was the wettest month on record for large parts of southern England. Floods are known to have occurred in a number of locations at this time, and were called the Duke of Wellington floods, as they started around the time of his state funeral in London. Norfolk aristocrat Lady Bayning was so interested by the wet weather that she took her rainfall gauge to London for the social season, and also recorded rainfall in Norfolk between 1835 and 1887. A vast number of locations with rain gauges across the country were discovered, including one next door to Beatrix Potter’s Hill Top farm in the Lake District, where she wrote many of her most famous books. Dr Mark McCarthy, the head of the Met Office’s National Climate Information Centre, said: “The UK rainfall record is notoriously variable, with extremes of weather presenting us with drought and flood. The more we can shine a light into the earlier chapters and extremes within the rainfall record, the better we are able to understand the risks presented to us by climate change and future extreme weather events.” A pint of draught ale cost about two pence. At the beginning of the year, George Hamilton Gordon, Earl of Aberdeen, was prime minister, but resigned for failing to manage the Crimean war efficiently. He was replaced by Henry John Temple, Viscount Palmerston. Florence Nightingale was treating patients in Crimea.

3/25/2022,"British Summer Time (BST) begins once again at 1.00am on Sunday 27 March, when you are obliged to put your clock forward by an hour to 2.00am. Not only do you lose an hour’s sleep, you also get to spend thirty minutes once you are awake on a Sunday morning trying to work out how to change the clock on the microwave and the washing machine if you have them. The ritual owes its origins in the UK to the first world war. The annual hourly changing of the clock was first established in the UK more than 100 years ago under the Summer Time Act 1916, with the thought that lighter evenings might preserve fuel for the war effort. In the debate in parliament about introducing it at the time, Henry Petty-FitzMaurice, the Marquess of Lansdowne, made reference to Benjamin Franklin, who had, half-jokingly, proposed a type of daylight saving time while living in Paris. There, in 1784, Franklin observed that the sun had risen much earlier than his Parisienne acquaintances. He argued they would save money on candles if they opted for earlier mornings rather than continue to enjoy their later nightlife. It would have been impossible to introduce daylight saving time on this side of the channel that early though, as the UK didn’t even have legal standardised time until 1880. Prior to that date, people calculated when noon was locally, and worked from that, but the introduction of railways and their timetables made ultra-local timezones confusing. The UK currently seems slightly isolated on the issue, in that there are no plans afoot to abolish the practice. The European parliament has voted to scrap mandating it at an EU level, leaving it up to national governments to decide whether to continue it. The US Senate has unanimously approved a measure that would make daylight saving time permanent across the United States next year, although the Sunshine Protection Act still needs approval from the House of Representatives and the president, Joe Biden, to come into force. The US first adopted daylight saving time as a wartime energy-saving measure in 1942. You will eventually get that lost hour back when BST ends this year on Sunday 30 October. It was all a lot easier when we used sundials, but there seems little appetite to change it. As the Marquess of Lansdowne observed in parliament in 1916 of the British people: “We do not like changing our habits, still less do we like changing them under instructions from acts of parliament.”",News/UK news,When do the clocks change in the UK – and what started the annual ritual?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/25/when-do-the-clocks-change-in-the-uk-british-summer-time
3/25/2022,"The UK’s resettlement scheme for those fleeing Ukraine has been called a “disgrace” by a Briton who said few in the country knew about its existence. Andrew Murray, a technology worker from north-east Scotland, said ministers’ claims about the success of the visa programme that is meant to allow charities, businesses or companies to sponsor a refugee “does not match the reality on the ground”. “The rhetoric stops at the border of Ukraine and does not penetrate where it’s needed,” he said. Speaking from Lviv, Murray said Ukrainians were “very grateful” for all the military equipment supplied by Britain to help fend off Russian forces. But he added: “They’re under no illusion that the UK has made it artificially difficult to seek sanctuary there,” calling the scheme a “disgrace”. Murray arrived in Ukraine earlier this week, with bundles of papers he drew up containing information about how those wanting to flee to the UK could navigate the process. He hoped to distribute the documents to charities and aid agencies, but said he realised “that’s a cottage industry trying to address an industrial scale problem”. After going to Lviv city hall and meeting officials on the council, he said he realised they had never heard of the UK’s “homes for Ukraine” programme. After initially restricting entry to only allow Ukrainians with close family members living in the UK to join them, ministers this month backtracked and set up a visa sponsorship system. More than 100,000 Britons signed up to host a refugee fleeing the Russian invasion. But the UK government has said it will not match people offering to open their doors with a person or family in need of shelter. Murray said he could not put into words the heart-rending devastation he had witnessed, seeing hundred of displaced Ukrainians from the besieged city of Mariupol arrive parched, starving and in need of a bed. “It’s embarrassing knowing we could take them to the UK,” he said. “We’ve got to do something here otherwise we’ll only see a trickle of people coming to the UK.” “These people are burned out, they’ve travelled half way across Ukraine and all they can think about is where to sit down and get some rest, water and soup. They can’t begin to think about bureaucracy and paperwork.” The government is still maintaining some checks need to be made on those applying to come to Britain through the sponsorship route. Michael Gove has said that security checks would establish whether people “are who they say they are” and prevent the scheme “being exploited possibly by criminal elements”. The Home Office is carrying out checks that the people offering up their homes are in a position to provide that support. Murray said he was hoping to travel back to the UK via Poland to push for the government to spread the word more successfully about the sponsorship programme and encourage humanitarian groups to link up with local council officials. “It’s being passed on through the grassroots and word of mouth rather than being driven top down,” he said. A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “We are moving as quickly as possible to ensure that those fleeing horrific persecution in Ukraine can find safety in the UK, setting up both the Ukraine family scheme and now the homes for Ukraine scheme, which allows those without family connections to come here. “We have streamlined the visa application process so valid passport holders no longer have to attend in-person appointments before arriving and made changes to the forms people have to fill out in order to help people through the process as quickly as possible.”",News/World news,"UK resettlement scheme for Ukrainians is a ‘disgrace’, says Briton in Lviv",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/uk-resettlement-scheme-ukrainians-is-a-disgrace-says-briton-in-lviv
3/25/2022,"Over the last few days, the well-known theatre actor Oksana Shvets and Artem Datsyshyn, soloist of the national opera-ballet, have been buried in Kyiv. These performers died when ballistic missiles hit Kyiv. At the same time, a Russian bomber was “carefully” dropping a half-tonne bomb on the Mariupol drama theatre; inside, more than 1,000 citizens, including children and elderly people, were sheltering from the air raids. The total war that Putin has declared on Ukraine implies that the aim is to make sure that Ukraine ceases to exist – along with its culture, history and language. On 17 March, a meeting between Russian functionaries and Russian cultural figures took place in Moscow. The statement released after the meeting states that Russian cultural figures fully support Russia’s “special operation” against Ukraine and will act together on the side of the Kremlin on the “cultural front”. The Russian “cultural front” is already open and making inroads into Europe. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, announced that only Putin is fighting against Ukraine and that the rest of the country is not to blame. So the Russian writers and poets who signed an open letter of support for Putin, published in the Literaturnaya Gazeta on 4 March, are not to blame. Meanwhile, the German PEN Centre opposed the boycott of Russian cultural products. Elsewhere, Ukrainian writers and musicians who have advocated a boycott of Russian culture have been accused of radicalism and hate speech. Ukrainian writers are being encouraged to sit next to Russian cultural figures on stages in Paris and Berlin and talk about reconciliation. The more bombs and rockets that fall on Ukrainian cities, the more radically Ukrainian writers and cultural figures will respond to these requests. Not everyone will respond, it is true – only those who are still alive. Among the latest victims of the war is the professor of Kyiv’s Theological Academy, Alexander Kislyuk, a famous translator from ancient Greek, Latin, ancient Slavonic, English and French. Thanks to him, books by Aristotle, Tacitus, Thomas Aquinas and many other ancient philosophers and scientists have appeared in Ukrainian translation. He can no longer take part in discussions about reconciliation with his Russian colleagues. He was shot on 5 March near his house in the village of Bucha, near Kyiv. In a basement in the village of Klavdievo, not far from Bucha, the refugee writer Vladimir Rafeenko is hiding with his wife from incessant bombing raids. They have tried to escape from Klavdievo to Kyiv but the constant shelling and bombing of the suburbs of Kyiv has made it impossible. He was given shelter in Kladievo at the summer cottage of the Ukrainian writer Andriy Bondar. Now half of the village of Klavdievo is destroyed. At the very beginning of the war, a Russian bomb fell on the museum dedicated to Maria Pryimachenko – the most famous “naive” Ukrainian artist – in the town of Ivankov, to the north of Kyiv. Braving the flames, local residents carried the paintings out of the museum and have hidden them away so that, after the war, when a new museum is built, the collection can be displayed once more. In the first week of the war, Kyiv’s museums received instructions from the Ministry of Culture to evacuate their collections to western Ukraine. Some museums simply hid their collections in basements; some managed to pack everything in boxes and now are waiting for transportation out of the city. But transport is in short supply – the evacuation of people and the delivery of humanitarian supplies have been prioritised. The protection of our cultural heritage has had to take second place. Universities, libraries and schools have been destroyed throughout eastern, south-eastern and central Ukraine. Educational institutions have no strategic value, but they are indeed used as humanitarian centres, aid depots and refugee centres. Russian troops are simply out to destroy any public infrastructure, regardless of the number or nature of the victims. Nevertheless, classes in schools and universities are due to recommence all over Ukraine from 1 April. Lectures, lessons and seminars will be online, both for the safety of students and teachers, and as a result of the physical destruction of university and school buildings. A decline in the quality of education is an inevitable consequence of this war, and it comes on top of two years of falling standards owing to the pandemic. But along with bitterness and pain, students may also feel a new surge of motivation to study better and to educate themselves at a time when education has become a secondary occupation. After all, right now the primary task of all citizens of Ukraine is to survive the war. A separate victim of Russian aggression is Russian culture itself. Ukrainians are rejecting it wholesale, in a spontaneous reaction that did not require any parliamentary decisions. In fact, the Ukrainian parliament has adopted a law prohibiting the importation of Russian books and publications for sale. In the occupied territories, of course, there will be no Ukrainian books until they have been liberated. For the time being, everything there will be Russian. Ukrainian radio and television have been cut off and you can only get Russian channels that broadcast Kremlin propaganda. There are still Ukrainian writers, journalists and scientists in the occupied territories, but their fate is uncertain. Many of them have not been in contact with the outside world for several days. Already, two weeks ago, Russian FSB agents started walking the streets of occupied Melitopol, in the south-east, with lists of names and addresses in their hands. They were looking for Ukrainian intellectuals, journalists and activists to take for interrogation. Mobile phones, computers and any other means of communication have been confiscated from detained Ukrainians and their family members, leaving these people completely isolated. We have no way of predicting what will happen to them next. In Kyiv, the chief concern is now the safety of the main shrine of Kyivan Rus: the Saint Sophia monastery and cathedral. The ensemble, whose oldest structures date back to the 12th century, stands on top of one of Kyiv’s hills very close to the headquarters of the Ukrainian security service, the headquarters of the border guards and the Kyiv city police department. These three buildings must sooner or later become targets for Russian missiles – and any attacks on them are bound to damage, if not destroy, Saint Sophia. The Ministry of Culture is keeping a record of destroyed historical and cultural sites. Dozens of new items are added to the list every day. But Ukrainian culture cannot be destroyed by bombs and missiles. It will survive, just as the Ukrainian language has survived, despite it being banned by more than 40 tzarist decrees during the 19th century, despite the Soviet policy of Russification of Ukraine, despite Russia’s current and violent hatred of everything Ukrainian.

3/25/2022,"After crossing the border from Ukraine, Olga Salko spent her first days in Moldova in Talmaza, a place she calls a “beautiful village on a hill”. It was a far cry from the horror she left behind in her husband’s home town near Mykolaiv. In Talmaza, Salko stayed with an elderly woman who volunteered to host her along with her sister, Taiyana, and her three-year-old daughter, Sophia. Salko, 36, and her family are one of many who have been welcomed into Moldovan homes, in Salko’s case just hours after arriving in Chișinău, Moldova’s capital city. In the past month, Ukraine’s small neighbour has received approximately 370,000 Ukrainian refugees, who have been met at the borders with acts of kindness from locals who have rallied to host and support them. But Moldova, one of the poorest nations in Europe, is also learning how badly war relief can drain resources as conflict creeps nearer to its eastern border with Ukraine. Abeer Etefa, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme, said so far, Moldova is the only country bordering Ukraine where the WFP is providing support for refugees – help that has come at the government’s request. “The capacity of the local community to continue to help these people will run out,” Etefa said, adding that the WFP intends to give financial stipends to host families as well as food aid to refugees. Still, many fear that relief efforts will come up short if the war in Ukraine continues. Russia has advanced around Odesa, close to Moldova’s border. If Odesa comes under attack, it is likely to prompt a new wave of refugees fleeing the intensifying violence. Meanwhile, experts in the region have warned that a disinformation campaign is under way, designed to spread panic among local communities. Videos in which people complain of Ukrainian refugees’ ingratitude, aggression, Russophobia or wealth are being widely shared on Moldovan social media. “It’s clear that these posts are orchestrated,” said Anastasia Nani, from Moldova’s Centre for Independent Journalism. “They look the same, use the same words and have the same messages,” she added, bringing up a montage put together by the independent Moldovan outlet Newsmaker, which proves her point. “There are people taking small incidents and amplifying their importance,” said Petru Macovei of Moldova’s Association of Independent Press. Valeriu Pașa from Watchdog, a Moldovan thinktank, adds: “We have noticed a change in the Kremlin’s tactics on social media.” Russian troll farms “are now hunting for authentic social media posts that fit their agenda and artificially making them viral”. “A video that has 12,000 shares but only 16 comments is clearly artificially viral,” Pașa commented. “Fake accounts they have created throughout the years, in the whole region, promote their narratives. You can see content with reactions from profiles from Hungary, Georgia, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, who have nothing to do with the local realities spoken about in the original posts,” Pașa said. “Unfortunately, Moldova has many Russian agents of influence,” Macovei said – including politics and the media. Four of the country’s 10 most watched TV channels are Russian re-transmissions with some local content. The country’s Committee for Exceptional Situations has brought back a law that bans news bulletins from countries that have not ratified the European Convention on Transfrontier Television – including Russia. “But the war gets represented in a distorted way even in these channels’ local news programmes,” Macovei said. Several channels were fined by Moldova’s Audiovisual Council for presenting a “unilateral” Russian perspective on the security crisis. “Beyond news, I also saw them broadcast a proliferation of triumphalist Soviet-era films on the Red Army,” Nani added. Moldova’s president, Maia Sandu, has asked the international community to help with the cost of hosting refugees from Ukraine. This week, the US pledged $30m (£23m) to Moldova to assist with relief efforts. The European Union earlier pledged €90m (£70m) for support in Ukraine and Moldova. Money from both will go to UN agencies and local civil society organisations. Olga Ghilca, a volunteer with Moldova for Peace, a group that started helping with relief efforts soon after Russia invaded Ukraine, says they are doing their best to prepare for more refugees but she fears an influx would overwhelm them. “Nobody can promise that we can deal with that because we’ve never dealt with that,” she said.
