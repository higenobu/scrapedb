1/10/2022,"The fossilised remains of a 10 metre-long ichthyosaur, a giant “sea dragon” that terrorised marine life 180m years ago, have been discovered beside England’s largest reservoir. The discovery at Rutland Water nature reserve is the most complete large ichthyosaur ever found in Britain, with a skull the size of a piano and weighing one tonne, including the Jurassic clay encasing it.  The startling outline of the enormous dolphin-like aquatic reptile was spotted by Joe Davis, a conservation team leader for Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust, during a routine draining of a lagoon island for re-landscaping in February last year. “It’s great to learn so much from the discovery and to think that this amazing creature was once swimming in seas above us,” said Davis, who rated the discovery as a “career highlight”. The hefty ichthyosaur, the first of its species, Temnodontosaurus trigonodon, to be discovered in Britain, was painstakingly excavated in August and September last year by an expert team of palaeontologists. Ichthyosaurs were not dinosaurs but a group of more than 100 species of marine reptile, which first appeared about 250m years ago and became extinct 90m years ago. They resembled dolphins in their body and jaw shape and varied in size from one metre to more than 25 metres in length. The excavation of clay blocks containing the skull and skeleton was led by global ichthyosaur expert Dr Dean Lomax and specialist palaeontological conservator Nigel Larkin, in partnership with Anglian Water, the reservoir owners, and Rutland county council and the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust. Lomax said: “Britain is the birthplace of ichthyosaurs – their fossils have been unearthed here for over 200 years, with the first scientific dating back to Mary Anning and her discoveries along the Jurassic Coast. “Despite the many ichthyosaur fossils found in Britain, it is remarkable to think that the Rutland ichthyosaur is the largest skeleton ever found in the UK. It is a truly unprecedented discovery and one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history.” Dr Mark Evans, of the British Antarctic Survey, and a visiting fellow at the University of Leicester said: “It’s a highly significant discovery both nationally and internationally but also of huge importance to the people of Rutland and the surrounding area.” Anglian Water is seeking heritage funding so that “the Rutland sea dragon” can remain on display in the county.

1/10/2022,"It was inevitable, but the speed with which it happened was still surprising. After the four protesters who toppled the statue of Edward Colston then helped to heave it into the harbour were acquitted, Conservative MPs, the rightwing press and the prime minister himself unleashed their volley of rage at the verdict. “Vandals can’t change our history,” postured Boris Johnson on the front page of the Daily Mail. A “green light to ransack the past” said the Sun. “A monumental mistake” punned the Telegraph, weakly. If one were a cynic, one would think that the newspaper stories, the statements and the tweets were all sitting in draft form, waiting to be posted, emailed and published. The responses were so rehearsed, so obtuse and so optimised for a polarising landing, that the issue seemed less about Colston’s statue and more about their rigid vision of Britain, a country that – in their eyes – has done no wrong, that owes no apology and should show no humility.  Certainly that seemed to be the motivation of Suella Braverman, the attorney general. For as soon as the media screams died down, she made clear her distaste at the trial’s outcome – predicated, lest we forget, on the decision of a properly convened jury of her fellow citizens – by threatening to refer the matter to the appeal court. There was “confusion”, she said. We needed “to clarify the law for future cases”. Clarity, one might suggest, that would better protect that never-to-be-questioned version of Britain. But that version of Britain, in which figures such as Colston are remote characters from the past who have no bearing on our lives today, is a fiction. The Colston statue topplers, and the Black Lives Matter protesters in general, are the ones trying to drag Britain’s view of itself closer to reality, one in which community relations are still strained as a result of deep inequalities that run, like cracks, from the past to the present. Maintaining fictions is hard work, so an army of propagandists must mobilise to spin, yarn and stitch together the lies that make up this permitted view of British history. One that displays the iconography of slavery and of empire in our public spaces and consciousness. The narrative that frames the Colston statue incident – and indeed all arguments about British history – is spun broadly around the clash of two schools of thought. One, an innocent, stoic, impartial one, not invested in any particular ideological narrative, and another that is aggressive and politically motivated. According to this construct, Colston stood peacefully, undisturbed by campaigns to remove or maintain him for years until some protesters, in a rush of blood, tore him down. In this world of neutral arbiters and wild vandals, we are led to believe that Colston was toppled by people who do not trade in logic, and have no respect for dialogue, or interest in peaceful resolution. The truth is that the protesters were motivated by frustration. All the peaceful avenues were exhausted, because those who kept Colston up were pugnaciously committed to the elevation of a statue of a slave trader, rather than considering what he represents in a modern Britain that is as delusional about the moral integrity of its colonial heroes as it is about the health of its race and ethnic relations. It is a trick that is constantly played by those who view British history as an objective and inoffensive series of facts that must be preserved for the record, rather than a living legacy of supremacy, both racial and national, that many are still invested in, and that still resides not just in our streets and squares but in our politics, our education and our economy. Most crucially when it comes to Colston’s statue, it resides in our government. There is no better example of how quickly history is rewritten to suit the establishment than the aftermath of the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020. What seemed like a moment of profound change was quickly miscast as the opposite, a marker in the sand for what happens when demands for racial equality are taken too far, when they become violent, militant and vandalistic. In that framing, there can be no place for the reality that Colston’s name was already being expunged from Bristol’s public spaces, a process that was citizen-campaign-led, consensual and consultative. There had been frequent rows dragging in historians, schoolchildren, councillors, the mayor and Bristol’s Society of Merchant Venturers – the guild and body that is accused of creating Bristol’s “cult of Colston”. And yet the council says it never considered removing the statue despite “significant community concerns”. This is what we continually fail to understand about the importance of reappraising our history: friction arises not from “woke vandals” but from a state that clings, despite all entreaty and evidence, to a glorification of a past that reinforces and legitimises all the injustices of the present. If those in the government and the media who are so critical of the toppling of Colston were really interested in forging a state of community cohesion, they would acknowledge the moral sins that built Britain’s wealth and empire – past cruelties that still reverberate across social mobility, life expectancy and job prospects. Instead, they fan the flames of a hysterical moral panic that claims the toppling of Colston was about destroying historical fact, rather than being a victory for that truth they work so hard to deny. We will only move forward when the organs of government, from Downing Street to local councils to education boards, resolve to take people’s demands seriously. Otherwise the state, which has now been unmasked as a partisan mediator through its intransigence in Bristol, loses all legitimacy and therefore control. That really would be, as Conservative MPs describe it, a licence to vandalise. Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist.

1/10/2022,"A gigantic prehistoric “sea dragon” discovered in the Midlands has been described as one of the greatest finds in the history of British palaeontology. The ichthyosaur, which is about 180m years old with a skeleton measuring about 10 metres in length and a skull weighing about a tonne, is the largest and most complete fossil of its kind ever found in the UK. Joe Davis of the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust discovered it during the routine draining of a lagoon island at the Rutland Water reservoir in February 2021.  The first ichthyosaurs, which are called sea dragons because they tend to have very large teeth and eyes, were discovered by the fossil hunter and palaeontologist Mary Anning in the early 19th century. Dean Lomax, a palaeontologist who has studied the species, said: “Despite the many ichthyosaur fossils found in Britain, it is remarkable to think that the Rutland ichthyosaur is the largest skeleton ever found in the UK. It is a truly unprecedented discovery and one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history.” Ichthyosaurs, which were marine reptiles, first appeared about 250m years ago and went extinct 90m years ago. They varied in size from 1 to more than 25 metres in length and resembled dolphins in their general body shape. The remains were dug out by a team of experts from around the UK in August and September. Two incomplete and much smaller ichthyosaurs were found during the construction of Rutland Water in the 1970s, but the latest discovery is the first complete skeleton. Mark Evans of the British Antarctic Survey, who has been studying the Jurassic fossil reptiles of Rutland and Leicestershire for more than 20 years, said that even from the first glimpse of the partially exposed fossil it was clear that it was the largest ichthyosaur discovered in the region. “However, it was only after our exploratory dig that we realised that it was practically complete to the tip of the tail,” he said. “It’s a highly significant discovery both nationally and internationally but also of huge importance to the people of Rutland and the surrounding area.” Nigel Larkin, a specialist palaeontological conservator, said: “It’s not often you are responsible for safely lifting a very important but very fragile fossil weighing that much. It is a responsibility, but I love a challenge. It was a very complex operation to uncover, record, and collect this important specimen safely.” The excavation of the remains will feature on BBC Two’s Digging For Britain on Tuesday at 8pm.",News/Science,Huge ‘sea dragon’ named one of UK’s greatest fossil finds,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/10/huge-sea-dragon-named-one-of-uks-greatest-fossil-finds
1/10/2022,"The Republican official who famously resisted Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn his election defeat in Georgia has said he will run for re-election on a platform of “integrity and truth”, against an opponent who as a churchman “should know better” than to advance the former president’s lies.  Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, became a household name after he turned down Trump’s demand that he “find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have [to get]” in order to overturn Joe Biden’s win in the southern state. It was the first victory by a Democrat in a presidential race in Georgia since 1992. This year, Raffensperger will run for re-election against Jody Hice, a pastor, US congressman and Trump acolyte. “Congressman Hice, he’s been in Congress for several years,” Raffensperger said on Sunday, on CBS’s Face the Nation. “He’s never done a single piece of election reform legislation. “Then he certified his own race with those same machines, the same ballots [that were used for the presidential election]. And yet for President Trump, he said you couldn’t trust that. “That’s a double-minded person. And as a pastor, he should know better. So, I’m going to run on integrity and I’m going to run on the truth. I don’t know what he’s going to run on.” Hice played a key role in legal and political attempts to overturn the 2020 election result. Writing for the Guardian to mark the anniversary of the 6 January Capitol attack, in which Trump supporters failed to stop Congress certifying the election result, the former Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal said that as the riot unfolded, Hice “raced by a Democratic colleague, who told me Hice was screaming into his phone: ‘You screwed it up, y’all screwed it all up!’” Hice, Blumenthal wrote, “was tasked to present a challenge to Georgia’s electors … as part of the far-rightwing Republican faction, the Freedom Caucus, directed by Congressman Jim Jordan, of Ohio, who was in constant touch that day with Mark Meadows, the Trump chief of staff and former Freedom Caucus member, and a watchful Trump himself. “Just as the violent insurrection launched, and paramilitary groups spearheaded medieval style hand-to-hand combat against the police and burst into the Capitol, Hice posted on Instagram a photo of himself headed into the House chamber with the caption, ‘This is our 1776 moment.’” Hice deleted that post and said he condemned the violence at the Capitol. But he formally objected to results in Arizona and Pennsylvania and voted against investigation of the attack. The select committee is reportedly interested in his own phone records as Hice remains a vocal proponent of the lie that Trump lost due to electoral fraud, a lie believed by clear majorities of Republicans. Hice announced his run to be secretary of state in Georgia, last March, later gaining Trump’s endorsement. Should he win, he will be in charge of state election counts. Many outside the Republican party fear the prospect of Trump allies filling such posts in battleground states, preparatory to another attempt to overturn a presidential election. “It’s certainly not by accident that we’re seeing individuals who don’t believe in democracy aspire to be our states’ chief election officers, particularly in the states that were under the greatest spotlight in 2020,” Jocelyn Benson, Michigan secretary of state, told the Guardian earlier this month. Raffensperger and Governor Brian Kemp, however, have placed Georgia among Republican-run states which have implemented election laws which critics say aim to restrict Democratic turnout. Asked about visits to Georgia this week by Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, to promote federal voting rights protections, Raffensperger told CBS: “6 January was terrible, but the response doesn’t need to be eliminating photo ID and then having same-day registration. “If you don’t have the appropriate guardrails in place, then you’re not going to have voter confidence in the results.” Pressed on claims by figures including the Georgia gubernatorial candidate and voting rights campaigner Stacey Abrams that state election law is skewed against people of colour, Raffensperger heralded provisions for early voting and said: “I think that we have shown that Georgia has fair and honest elections. We have record registrations. We have record turnout.” He also said he was confident Hice would not take over the elections process. “The results will be the results,” Raffensperger said, “and those will be the results that will be certified. You cannot overturn the will of the people and so that won’t matter. “But at the end of the day, I will be re-elected, and he will not be.”",News/US news,Georgia Republican who resisted Trump insists he stands for ‘integrity and truth’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/10/brad-raffensperger-georgia-republican-trump-jody-hice

1/10/2022,"When Julian Bird was 60, he was diagnosed with cancer of the bladder. He had a series of operations, “all very unpleasant”, and learned that he “was likely to die pretty soon”. After 34 years as a psychiatrist, in that intense state of mind, he began to daydream about becoming a professional actor. The bleak prognosis held for only a few months, and as he recovered Bird reevaluated his life “and what to do with what was left of it”. At the age of 63, he enrolled at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. This month, at 80, he is the lead in the play Freud’s Last Session, at the King’s Head theatre, in north London.  “I was brought up in a theatre family,” Bird says. His father, Henry Bird, was an artist who designed sets. His mother, Freda Jackson, was an actor, “a name in the 40s, 50s and 60s”. She was the lead in the play No Room at the Inn, about the abuse of evacuees during the second world war, which was so scandalous that she needed police protection when it transferred to the West End in 1946. “There were always women at the stage door wanting to kill her.” Despite this, Bird “always loved theatre”. Indeed, the Drury Lane stage where his mother performed No Room at the Inn was the venue for his fifth birthday party. He was then a newly returned evacuee himself and recalls “being the centre of attention”. There were “all the kids in the cast”, though many were teenagers playing younger children, which must have felt a little strange. An only child, at 13 he went to boarding school. “There were lonely times,” he says. “Every time I returned, there would be somebody else looking after me, a housekeeper/secretary.” He gave little thought to following his mother into acting. When he was seven or eight, he fell ill; the illness was mysterious, with aches and pains. His mother found a doctor in Harley Street and the consultation proved decisive. The elderly physician “was very empathic and wise. He was interested in me as a person,” Bird says. “He got books down off his shelf and invited me to join him in understanding the problem. And that’s very seductive …” Curiously, Bird has no memory of the diagnosis. “But I left that consultation feeling: ‘I want to be like him. I’m going to be a doctor.’” His parents were delighted. Bird studied natural sciences at Cambridge, before going on to medical school in London. He had scarcely dabbled in Cambridge’s drama scene for fear of profiting from his mother’s renown, but in London he directed and starred in a production of The Doctor’s Dilemma. (His mother, in the audience, was complimentary.) By now Bird had become interested in neurology and psychiatry. The neurologist who supervised him was distinguished but dull, while the consultant psychiatrist was charismatic. So Bird became a psychiatrist. I wonder why he was so susceptible to the charisma of the Harley Street medic and the psychiatry teacher. “I suspect it has something to do with my relationship with my father. He was not an emotionally expressive man. He painted. In his studio. Every day. Seven days a week,” Bird says. “Perhaps I wanted, needed, to have a close relationship with a father figure.” As a psychiatrist, in academia and in practice, Bird studied the patient-doctor relationship and his research included roleplay. He enjoyed this “emotionally expressive” dimension, but it was not until he arrived at drama school in 2004 that he saw the connection between psychiatry and acting. Almost immediately, “there was joy, and a realisation that this was the right place … I was hooked.” At drama school, Bird understood, “I am an actor. I can’t understand the notion of retirement. It doesn’t exist. I’m an actor. That’s what I do.” It is tempting to wonder what his mother, who died in 1990, would have made of his career change. He has worked in TV and theatre for the past 15 years. “I would have loved her involvement and appreciation,” he says. There’s a pause. Recently, he has had “a passing thought. Maybe that freedom was partly possible because they both had gone. I was free of their influence.” On stage, Bird says, “I can feel the audience. This focus of attention is very important, and it is a powerful feeling and it gives me power … I feel most real on stage, and connected.” Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",Lifestyle/Life and style,A new start after 60: ‘I almost died of cancer.

1/10/2022,"Women’s safety campaigners have called the Home Office’s backing of an app that allows users to track their friends’ journeys home “insulting to women and girls”, arguing that it does nothing to tackle the issue of men’s violence against women. The new app provides anyone walking home at night with a monitored route on their phone. If the walker moves more than 40 metres from the route or stops for more than three minutes, the app asks if they are OK. If there is no reply, nominated “guardians” – normally friends and family – receive a notification on their phones to say there has been a deviation. They can then check on the person in question and alert the police if they are unable to do so.  The Home Office minister, Rachel Maclean, said such schemes should be part of a wider plan to make streets safer for women and girls. “We need a whole-of-society approach to tackling violence against women and girls, and I welcome initiatives from the private sector that deliver on this aim,” she said. Anna Birley from Reclaim These Streets, which was set up after the murder of Sarah Everard, said safety apps did nothing to tackle the underlying problem of men’s violence against women. “The Home Office backing of this app is insulting to women and girls,” she said. “We already share our location, we already ask our friends to text us when they get home, we already wear bright clothes, stick to the well-lit routes and clutch our keys between our fingers. “It still isn’t enough. Women and girls, and the steps that we take to stay safe every day, are not the problem. The problem is that male violence makes us unsafe.” The free, not-for-profit app, Path Community, is being trialled by about 500 people including Metropolitan police officers in Southwark and Lambeth in south London. It creates routes avoiding unlit streets, alleys or areas known for antisocial behaviour and users can mark where they feel unsafe. Harry Mead, the creator, told the Guardian that anonymised information can then be shared with local councils and police to establish problem areas that may need more resources. The platform was also developing an education platform, he said. “The underlying issue of men’s violence is the core problem and everyone has to help tackle it,” he said. “The app is designed to help with immediate concerns and help users feel safer. Path is our attempt to do our bit.”. Domestic violence campaigners have also raised concerns about safety apps that track movement being misused by abusers. They could “potentially extend an abuser’s reach beyond the home, controlling women in spaces they previously felt safe and free”, said the chief executive of Women’s Aid, Farah Nazeer. The Home Office and police and crime commissioners needed to work with the women’s sector to remove barriers to their safety, she said. “There is so much work to be done to increase survivors’ confidence in reporting abuse to police, tackle misogyny with public awareness and education and, of course, provide adequate funding to services supporting survivors,” she said. Mead said developers were very conscious of the issue of potential misuse and had designed the app to be as private as possible while providing maximum safety. Tracking only lasted for the duration of a set journey and users would always be contacted first to check if they were OK before a guardian was notified while a toggle to turn live tracking on and off was being developed, he added. The shadow minister for domestic violence, Jess Phillips, said: “This seems like a sticking plaster instead of dealing with the actual problem that is men’s violence against women.” A spokesperson for the Home Office said its Tackling Violence against Women and Girls strategy launched last year included initiatives and funding to target potential perpetrators and protect potential victims, including the pilot of the StreetSafe online tool, which allows the public to anonymously report areas where they feel unsafe.",News/UK news,"Women’s safety app backed by Home Office is insulting, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/10/womens-safety-app-backed-by-home-office-is-insulting-experts-say
1/10/2022,"An updated government app will use barcodes to encourage families to switch to healthier food as part of efforts to tackle Britain’s child obesity crisis. The new feature, announced on Monday as part of the Better Health campaign, will scan selected shopping items and suggest alternatives with less saturated fat, sugar or salt. Families using the NHS Food Scanner app will also be shown a “Good Choice” badge for items which could help improve their diet, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said.  It follows a record rise in obesity among 10- to 11-year-olds, with surveys suggesting that parents have been giving more unhealthy snacks to their children since the start of the pandemic. Lockdowns, school closures and sports activities being suspended meant many children spent less time doing physical activity than usual in the past year. Increased screen time may have also increased children’s exposure to adverts for unhealthy food and takeaway services, potentially influencing food choices. The latest data suggests one in four children of reception school age are overweight or obese and this rises to four in 10 in Year 6, according to the DHSC. A new survey conducted jointly by the department and Netmums, a UK parenting website, suggests nearly six in 10 parents have given their children more sugary or fatty food since the start of the pandemic. Public health minister, Maggie Throup, said that the “pressure” faced by families throughout the pandemic meant dietary habits had “drastically changed” as a result. “The new year is a good time for making resolutions, not just for ourselves, but for our families. Finding ways to improve their health is one of the best resolutions any of us could make,” she said. Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at the DHSC, said advertisements promoting unhealthy food to children were contributing to the problem. “It’s not surprising that parents say they’ve often found it hard to resist pestering from their children for more unhealthy snacks, and that is why the NHS Food Scanner App is a great tool to help families make quick and easy healthier swaps,” Tedstone said. “It’s so important that children reduce the amount of sugary, fatty and salty foods they eat to help them stay healthy and reduce the risk of health problems such as diabetes and tooth decay.” Girls Aloud singer Nadine Coyle, who has backed the campaign alongside dietician Linia Patel, said: “As a busy working mum, I find it hard to say no to my kid’s demands and often give in to snack pressure – even though I know it’s not that good for them. I had no idea some foods were so high in sugar, saturated fat and salt – so it’s great that the app gives you alternatives.”",News/Society,NHS Food Scanner app will use barcodes to suggest healthier eating choices,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/10/nhs-food-scanner-app-will-use-barcodes-to-suggest-healthier-eating-choices
1/10/2022,"Lithuania has paid more than $110,000 to Abu Zubaydah, the Guantánamo detainee known as the “forever prisoner”, in compensation for having allowed the CIA to hold him at a secret site outside Vilnius where he was subjected to forms of torture.  The €100,000 ($113,500) payment comes more than three years after the European Court of Human Rights ordered the Lithuanian government to pay compensation for violating European laws banning the use of torture. It marks a significant shift in the treatment of Zubaydah, who has been detained by the US without charge for more than 20 years. Zubaydah was captured in Pakistan six months after 9/11. The CIA and lawyers for the Bush administration attempted to justify his torture by claiming he was a very senior figure in al-Qaida. It emerged that he was not a member of the organisation and he has never been charged with involvement in 9/11. For much of the time since his arrest, Zubaydah has been held incommunicado, at the insistence of the CIA as part of its efforts to prevent details of his torture from becoming public. Lawyers for Zubaydah believe it is highly unlikely that Lithuania would have made the compensation payment without approval from Washington. “The situation is a lot less incommunicado when you pay €100,000 to someone and the whole world knows about it,” Mark Denbeaux, one of Zubaydah’s legal team based in the US, told the Guardian. “This move is consistent with the idea that the US is softening its position on the detention of the forever prisoners. The US could clearly have kept Lithuania from handing over this money and the question is, why didn’t they?” News of the Lithuanian payment comes just days before the 20th anniversary of the military prison at Guantánamo, which received its first detainees on 11 January 2002. In recent months there have been other signs of a shifting attitude towards Zubaydah and the torture that was inflicted upon him by CIA agents and contractors. In October, the US supreme court heard arguments in a case in which the US government is seeking to block two CIA contractors from testifying in Poland about torture Zubaydah suffered in 2002 and 2003 at a secret or “black” site in that country. In the course of the hearing, several of the justices, including conservatives, broke a legal taboo by openly using the word “torture”. In Zubaydah’s case against Lithuania, which was led on the European side by his lawyer Helen Duffy, the European Court of Human Rights heard that Zubaydah was held at a CIA black site in that country from February 2005 to March 2006. The site, codenamed Violet, was on the outskirts of Vilnius. The most brutal forms of torture endured by Zubaydah occurred in 2002 when he was held at a CIA black site in Thailand. An entire program of torture, euphemistically referred to by the CIA as “enhanced interrogation techniques”, was devised for the prisoner by two psychologists under contract to the agency. Zubaydah was waterboarded – a type of controlled drowning – at least 83 times in August 2002, as well as being placed in a coffin-sized box for days on end. European judges heard that Zubaydah was unlikely to have suffered from the harshest forms of torture while in Lithuania. But he was subjected to techniques that still amounted to torture, lawyers argued, including sensory and sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, loud noise and harsh light. The money transferred by Lithuania is now in a bank account. Zubaydah is unable to receive the sum given his detention in Guantánamo and because his assets have been frozen by the US treasury.

The shadow secretary for climate change and net zero and former shadow business secretary said there was “no greater proof that this government’s incompetence and weak leadership is costing millions of hard-working families”, as energy producers have been making near-record profits because of soaring wholesale gas prices that are driving up bills.  Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, set out her plan over the weekend for a £1.2bn tax on producers to fund a £200-average cut to household bills, plus £600 of targeted support for those most in need, but on Sunday the government dismissed this as a solution. Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary and a former oil industry executive, told LBC radio: “What Labour are putting out just doesn’t add up. A windfall tax on oil and gas companies that are already struggling in the North Sea is never going to cut it.” The government has been holding talks with energy bosses before a decision by Ofgem due in February about whether the price cap on bills needs to rise from April to cover the cost of soaring gas prices. However, ministers currently favour some support targeted at the lowest-income families rather than a VAT cut for all, and now appear to have rejected the idea of a windfall tax. Miliband told the Guardian: “This clear confirmation that the Conservatives oppose the windfall tax tells you exactly whose side they are on – and it’s not the British people struggling with their energy bills. “It beggars belief that a cabinet minister believes that we should prioritise oil and gas companies making huge windfall profits that he says are ‘struggling’, rather than the British people who face the true struggle to pay their energy bills. “It is fair and right to ask these companies to make a one-off extra contribution to help so many people who are facing appalling hardship.” After the proposal for a windfall tax to pay for the VAT cut, Labour made a new call for a £600m government fund to help businesses deal with soaring fuel bills, also funded by the windfall tax. The party will on Tuesday force a vote in parliament on support for businesses hit by energy prices rises, calling for the government to scrap business rates, reduce the debt burden that firms are facing and create the £600m contingency fund. Boris Johnson is under some pressure from his own backbenchers to take action over the issue of energy costs hurting households, but there is a split between the right of the party who want to remove green levies and defenders of the net zero strategy who propose carbon taxes on industry. Chris Skidmore, the Tory MP for Kingswood and a former energy minister, told Channel 4 News: “A windfall tax, whether you call it that or you want to call it a carbon tax – [what] I would rather talk about is how we achieve a carbon tax for the future – is absolutely, I think, the right way to go.” The Conservative MP has launched a “net zero support group” to defend efforts to decarbonise the economy against some of his colleagues who are claiming it costs too much.",News/Politics,"Tory rejection of windfall tax on energy firms ‘beggars belief’, says Ed Miliband",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/10/tory-rejection-of-windfall-tax-on-energy-firms-beggars-belief-says-ed-miliband
1/10/2022,"Soaring energy bills rooted in a global gas supply crunch have focused minds on the age-old problem: how can we better store power? Attention has turned to the closure of the Rough gas storage facility in the North Sea in 2017, which left the UK with only enough storage to meet the demand of four to five winter days.  But while gas is being phased out, Britain’s growing reliance on renewables, such as offshore wind and solar, does not solve the problem of intermittency – what happens when the wind does not blow or the sun does not shine. The key to securing enough affordable, low-carbon energy is more storage to make the most of the renewable energy available. A storage boom has been forecast over the coming decade as governments race to meet their climate targets. Within the next five years, the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects global energy storage capacity to expand by 56% to reach more than 270 GW by 2026, driven by a growing need to create flexible electricity systems which rely more on renewable sources. Well-established lithium-ion batteries are expected to dominate, according to a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, but their capacity is measured in hours rather than days. New energy technologies, which can store energy for longer periods, have found renewed favour within the power industry as the winter energy crisis has unfolded. Here are four long-range energy storage options which could help to keep the lights on in the future: Hydropower has acted as a form of energy storage in the UK for decades. The principle is simple: electricity is used to pump water upwards into a reservoir when the market has ample power available. When electricity supplies become tight the water can be released at short notice to flow over a generating turbine to create electricity for the grid to use. A new breed of pumped storage could play an even greater role than the giant hydropower plants of the past. Engineers believe they could unlock hundreds of potential sites across the UK, which would be quicker and cheaper to build than traditional hydropower dams. By using a mineral-rich fluid, which has more than two-and-a-half times the density of water, projects could generate the same amount of electricity from slopes which are less than half as high. Typically, pumped hydropower is stored within the range of five to 175 hours, compared with the most-used lithium-ion battery technology which can usually store electricity for less than four hours, according to the IEA. One report by the Paris-based agency found that India dominates the expansion of pumped hydropower storage thanks to projects using its existing large reservoirs. Another form of “mechanical energy storage” which could play a greater role in the future involves harnessing “gravity energy” to create electricity by using electric winches to hoist 12,000-tonne weights to the top of a disused mine shaft when there is plenty of renewable energy available, then dropping the weights hundreds of metres down vertical shafts to generate electricity when needed. These innovative storage projects are unlikely to replace the UK’s need for batteries, but they could help the country meet its climate targets at a lower cost. In the heat of the Nevada desert US engineers have already begun pioneering new technology which stores energy generated by renewables as heat. The Crescent Dunes project uses the heat of a vast solar farm, concentrated using mirrors, to heat molten salt to temperatures of up to 560C. The salt is able to maintain this temperature until electricity is needed. Then, the heat is used to run a conventional steam turbine which generates enough electricity to power 75,000 homes long after the sun has set. The IEA expects China to lead the expansion of concentrated solar power storage thanks to a generous subsidy scheme, which is poised to continue until the end of this year. Beyond China, the United Arab Emirates is expected to roll out the second-largest volume of new capacity globally. There are also similar projects emerging across Australia. Concentrated solar power is typically stored for between five to 15 hours, according to the IEA, more than three times the duration of traditional lithium-ion batteries. Unlike batteries, which have a finite number of charge/discharge cycles, the molten silicon can be used indefinitely and can be recycled when the units reach the end of their 20-year service life. Demand for hydrogen made from water and renewable energy is expected to boom in the decades ahead as governments plan to replace the fossil fuels used in power plants, factories and heavy transport with the clean-burning, green alternative. But green hydrogen can also be used as a form of energy storage. “When the wind is blowing but the grid is oversupplied with renewable energy you can store energy in a battery for about an hour,” said Graham Cooley, the chief executive of ITM Power, which makes the electrolysers used to produce green hydrogen. “But if you want to store energy for days or even months you need something new.” In the past, the UK’s electricity system operator has been forced to pay renewable energy developers to switch off their wind turbines or solar farms to avoid overloading the grid with green electricity when power supplies outstrip demand. But using sunny weekends and windy nights to run electrolysers and create green hydrogen could help countries make better use of their wind and solar farms. Colley said ITM Power faces growing demand for its electrolysers, which are built at a factory in Sheffield, in part because the cost of producing green hydrogen has come down radically in line with the falling cost of renewable energy. It helps that more energy companies are interested in avoiding the record market price for fossil fuel gas too, he added. Within the coming months one of the world’s biggest liquid air, or “cryogenic”, batteries will begin operating near Manchester in the UK after its developers promised it could help store renewable energy for weeks rather than hours. The project is being developed by Highview Power. It plans to use renewable electricity to chill air to -196C, transforming it into a liquid that could be stored in large metal tanks for weeks. When needed, the liquid can be turned back into gas, and used to turn a turbine and generate enough electricity to power up to 200,000 homes for five hours. The full-scale “cryobattery” will have a capacity of 50MW or 250MWh over a five-hour release time, and follows the success of a 5MW pathfinder project built next to a landfill site in Bury, Greater Manchester, in summer 2018. Highview has plans to build its long-duration batteries in the US and Chile, and earlier this year set out plans to develop seven new liquid-air projects in Spain at a cost of about $1bn (£735m). Its UK project will be the first.",News/Business,Here’s how to solve the UK energy crisis for the long term – store more power,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/10/heres-how-to-solve-the-uk-energy-crisis-for-the-long-term-store-more-power
1/10/2022,"The inner planet Mercury is currently at its greatest eastern elongation, meaning that it is relatively high in the evening sky. This makes it as easy as it is ever going to be to spot the planet.  Although the moment of greatest elongation occurred on 7 January, the small rocky planet hasn’t yet dropped in the night sky, so the view is still good on Monday night. The chart shows the view looking south-west from London at 1700GMT on 10 January, but you should start looking 15 minutes earlier, because the longer you delay, the lower the elusive planet sinks towards the horizon. A good way to orient yourself is to find Jupiter first – it is conspicuously bright in the sky at present. Then scan diagonally downwards. Mercury is close to Saturn in the sky, and the three planets will make a more or less straight line. Saturn will be fainter than Mercury, so you may spot Mercury first. From Sydney, Australia look to the west at around 2030AEDT. Mercury will be about seven and a half degrees above the horizon, which is a degree or so higher than it will appear from London. For reference, the full moon is half a degree wide.",News/Science,Starwatch: where to look to spot the elusive Mercury,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/10/starwatch-where-to-look-to-spot-the-elusive-mercury
1/10/2022,"Britain faces a housing crisis in the wake of the pandemic as confusion about planning rules and shortages of staff undermine government targets to build 300,000 homes a year, according to a House of Lords committee. A retreat from housebuilding by smaller companies must be tackled by ministers to reduce the shortage of homes, the cross-party group of peers said.  “Too many people currently live in expensive, unsuitable and poor-quality homes, and housing supply needs to be increased now to tackle the housing crisis,” the committee said in its report, titled Meeting Housing Demand. The housing secretary, Michael Gove, is expected to set out the government’s plans to kickstart housebuilding after the industry suffered the twin blows of Brexit, which reduced the amount of skilled labour available, and the upheaval caused by the pandemic. Gove has indicated he will encourage employment and housing in the regions as part of the government’s levelling up agenda, though this is likely to be a long-term project. Baroness Neville-Rolfe, chair of the Lords’ built environment committee, said: “The government’s ambitious target of 300,000 new homes a year will only be met if it takes action to remove the barriers for housebuilders, particularly for SMEs, which 35 years ago built 39% of new homes but now build just 10%.” The committee was critical of a U-turn over proposed reforms to planning rules that would have divided areas into zones, some of which are reserved for conservation and others that have few or no rules holding back developers. Ministers abandoned the proposals after the Liberal Democrats overturned a 16,000 Tory majority in the Chesham and Amersham by-election, which local Conservative leaders blamed largely on a rejection of the planning scheme by local voters. Uncertainty and delays to planning reforms have had a ‘“hilling effect” on housebuilding and created uncertainty for housebuilders and planners, Neville-Rolfe said. The former minister and Tesco board director said local authorities needed to adopt local plans to indicate where new developments could go ahead. She said less than 50% of local authorities had adopted or updated their local plans in the last five years, leaving developers in the dark over what land was available for new building. But she warned that any reform of the planning system “will only work if local planning authorities have the resources and staff”. Local authorities have complained that after 11 years of austerity measures, which has forced them to push through 40% cuts to day-to-day budgets, planning departments are only a fraction of the size needed to assess applications. Nevertheless, they say, more than 1.1m applications have been agreed, but private developers have failed to begin building. “It was probably what surprised me most during our investigation. Not so much the shortages of bricklayers and skilled construction workers, which is acute and well known, but the lack of skills in planning after years of not training people,” she said. Neville-Rolfe urged ministers to take into account an ageing population that will mean that by 2050, one in four people in the UK will be aged over 65. “The country needs more specialist and mainstream housing suitable for the elderly,” she said.",News/Society,"Sort out housebuilding obstacles or miss target, Lords warn UK government",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/10/sort-out-housebuilding-obstacles-or-miss-target-lords-warn-uk-government
1/10/2022,"The AFLW will be without two of its biggest stars for the rest of the season after scans confirmed the worst-case scenarios for Isabel Huntington and Bri Davey, who both suffered ACL injuries during the opening round over the weekend. Huntington, the No 1 pick in the 2017 draft, is now facing a third knee reconstruction in her short Western Bulldogs career while Davey, last year’s AFLW best and fairest winner, will undergo her second ACL surgery on the same knee having first injured it in 2018.  A third big name, Brisbane’s Kate Lutkins, is facing a nervous wait on her own scan results after injuring her knee on Sunday. Scans showed Huntington ruptured her right ACL graft and damaged her lateral meniscus after her knee buckled as she changed direction in the Bulldogs’ loss to Melbourne on Saturday. The standout junior lost the 2018 and 2019 seasons to similar injuries before she returned to win the 2020 Rising Star as a defender. “We are absolutely devastated for Izzy – she is a much-loved figure at the kennel, and everyone is well aware of her injury battles, so we’re just heartbroken for her,” Bulldogs women’s football boss Debbie Lee said. “She worked extremely hard this pre-season to get herself ready for this year, so it’s a real shame her 2022 campaign has been cut short. “Izzy is a true professional though, and having been through this twice before she will know what’s required of her. As a club, we’ll continue to support her and the family in any way we can.” Magpies co-captain Davey left the field in tears late in the fourth term of Sunday’s 19-point victory over Carlton at Ikon Park and after will not return until next season at least, after scans confirmed she had ruptured her ACL and had a medial collateral ligament tear in her right knee. Collingwood’s head of women’s football, Jess Burger, said the entire program was “heartbroken” for Davey, who won the club’s best and fairest medal and was named captain of the All-Australian side last year. “It’s very hard to see our captain go down with such a cruel injury, let alone someone who is at the top of their game,” Burger said. “There is no doubt her injury has been felt not just within our team, but across the entire AFLW community. “She’s recovered from this injury before and knows what it takes to get herself back to being regarded as one of the competition’s best. Bri will continue to play a key role in leading this team from the sidelines this season and our entire program will wrap our arms around her during this difficult time.” Both players will consult with their surgeons this week.",Sport/Sport,ALFW loses two of its brightest stars for rest of season due to knee injuries,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/10/alfw-loses-two-of-its-brightest-stars-for-rest-of-season-due-to-knee-injuries
1/10/2022,"The garden looks monochrome in a pale grey mist, the hawthorn outside my kitchen window two-dimensional. A lone blackbird is up early to feed on the berries strung like beads along spiny branches. I hold my breath as a shadowy hare lopes along, and I can just make out the bouncing white rumps of two roe deer. Otherwise, everything is still. As the day warms, the berries colour to a dull red and more birds arrive. At one time I count a fluster of seven blackbirds, wings flapping, tails dipping as they teeter on twig ends to snatch with pincering beaks. On other days there have been winter visitors from Europe, redwings and fieldfares, or our native plump wood pigeons flashing white neck patches, drawn by the haws that are rich in antioxidants.  This little tree is barely twice my height yet it feeds so many. A grey squirrel pauses to snack on its daily run along the dry stone wall. Heaps of chewed berries on the ground show where mice have fed. In spring, hawthorn leaves are the first to emerge in the valley, followed by blossoms, plentiful in nectar and pollen for bees and hoverflies. Parties of long-tailed tits move restlessly between the garden trees, gathering other species of tits into their circus act. My little hawthorn is a favourite place to feed as they swing through it, picking off aphids, spiders, tiny insects and moth caterpillars. Today among the blackbirds there’s a goldcrest, and on the mossy stones below, a wren, as fast and slight as a blown leaf. I’ve photographed the angular branches backlit by the west, when ice balls knock together against a pink sky, or lurid sunsets flame in late summer. In the flower borders, I find spiky seedlings, progeny to make a note of and transplant somewhere new in winter. This then is my paean to the hawthorn. January is a good month to plant a bare-rooted tree, costing little, quick to establish while dormant. The blackbirds are joined by a song thrush, brown spots on its creamy white breast, and I’m struck by what a difference one small tree can make.
