5/2/2022,"STORY: Apartment buildings with blackened walls and piles of rubble - this is what remains of much of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Two months of bombardment and siege by Russian forces have reduced the once thriving city to a wasteland. It has seen the bloodiest fighting and worst humanitarian catastrophe of the war. Ukraine says 100,000 civilians remain there. Among them is social worker Oxana Hvostenko. She says there is literally nothing left of her home - all that remains is a toilet, a door and a hallway. After losing her home, Hvostenko is staying with her friend Sergei Gradovich. ""Who should I thank for this? Tell me. Was it necessary to bomb civilians with such bombs. You have to be a fanatic to do it. No shame, no conscience, no feeling of proportion. Nothing. They made the whole block homeless in old age."" After failing to capture Kyiv in a nine-week assault that has turned cities to rubble, killed thousands and forced 5 million Ukrainians to flee abroad, Russia is now focusing on the east and south of Ukraine. Ukraine’s armed forces said on Saturday that Russia had failed to capture three target areas. Moscow said on Saturday its artillery units had struck 389 Ukrainian targets overnight. Britain's defence ministry said on Saturday that Russia had been forced to merge and redeploy depleted units from failed advances in northeastern Ukraine. Reuters could not independently verify the reports on what was happening on the ground. Ukraine's border guard service posted a video on its Facebook page showing about 16 weary-looking soldiers in battle fatigues, singing the national anthem in a small basement room. The service said the fighters were border guards helping to defend Mariupol’s Azovstal steel works, the last bastion of Ukrainian forces holding out against Russian invaders. Reuters could not verify the video. Russia denies targeting civilians in what it says is a ""special military operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its southern neighbor. Ukraine and its western allies call that a baseless pretext for a war of aggression.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Mariupol residents mourn ruined homes,https://news.yahoo.com/mariupol-residents-mourn-ruined-homes-145212295.html
5/2/2022,"Charles Herbster said he would put sex education ""back in the homes where it belongs."" The Nebraskan Gubernatorial candidate also said he was going to ""quit CRT"" in the state. Herbster has been accused of sexual assault by eight women, two of whom have come forward publicly. Nebraska gubernatorial candidate Charles Herbster said that sex education should be taken out of schools and ""put back in the homes"" during a Trump campaign rally in Greenwood, Nebraska, on Sunday. The Trump-endorsed Republican said he was going to ""quit CRT"" and ""cut taxes"" before going in on sex education. ""We're gonna take sex education out of the schools and put it back in the homes where it belongs,"" Herbster said Sunday evening to the Trump crowd. An April 14 report from the Nebraska Examiner quoted eight women who accused Herbster of sexual misconduct between 2017 and 2022. Many of them had been groped during a 2019 Republican fundraiser in Douglas County, Nebraska. Three people have spoken on the record to corroborate the claims. Elizabeth Todsen, an employee of State Sen. Dave Murman, who was present at the dinner, came forward as Herbster's second public accuser on Saturday. Todsen told the Examiner that after Herbster groped her while greeting her table, ""it was just all a blur after that happened because it was all I could think about."" ""This decision to come forward with my story has been extremely difficult due to my fear of repercussions from Charles W. Herbster, a powerful voice in Nebraska politics,"" Todsen said to Insider in a statement provided on behalf of her lawyer. ""But after thinking about this for years now, I know that it is time that Nebraskans know about the horrible actions made by Charles W. Herbster."" Previously, State Sen. Julie Slama was the only person not quoted anonymously in the Examiner's story. Herbster has since filed a lawsuit against her. In a press release sent to Insider, Herbster – CEO and President of Carico Farms and Herbster Angus Farms – denied all the allegations. ""Charles W. Herbster has already filed legal action against one of the people named in reports and will be taking legal action against others,"" the release said. ""He will not stop fighting until his name is cleared and he is vindicated."" Trump also defended Herbster during the rally, saying that the accusations were ""malicious charges to derail him.""

5/2/2022,"By Brenda Goh and Sophie Yu SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's commercial capital of Shanghai was dealt a blow on Monday as authorities reported 58 new COVID-19 cases outside quarantine areas while Beijing pressed on with testing millions of its people on a May Day holiday few were celebrating. Tough coronavirus measures in Shanghai have stirred rare public anger, with millions of the city's 25 million people confined indoors for more than a month, some sealed inside fenced off residential compounds, and many struggling to secure daily necessities. Shanghai residents breathed a sigh of relief at the weekend on news that no cases had been confirmed outside quarantine areas for two days, but bad news came on Monday with the report of the 58 new infections. Authorities did not comment on the new cases at a media briefing but members of the public weighed in online. ""They announced that they stamped out cases at the community level too early,"" one person commented on the Weibo social media platform. But many people also took heart from data that showed an encouraging trend with 32 new deaths on Sunday, compared with 38 a day earlier, and 6,606 new asymptomatic cases, from 7,084 the previous day. ""There is hope for May,"" said another Weibo user. The coronavirus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 and for the two years authorities managed to keep outbreaks largely under control with lockdowns and travel bans. But the fast-spreading Omicron variant has tested China's ""zero-COVID"" policy this year, an important one for President Xi Jinping who is expected to secure a precendent-breaking third leadership term. NEW FOCUS ON BEIJING China's COVID policy looks increasingly bizarre to much of the outside world, where many governments have eased restrictions, or thrown them off altogether, in a bid to ""live with COVID"" even though infections are spreading. China has given no hint of deviating from its policy despite a mounting toll on the world's second-largest economy, and the ripples of disruption travelling out through global supply chains. In the capital, home to 22 million people, authorities tighten COVID restrictions over the five-day Labour Day holiday that runs through Wednesday, traditionally one the busiest tourist seasons. Beijing, with dozens of daily infections in an outbreak now entering two weeks, has not locked down, instead relying, at least for now, on mass testing to locate and isolate infections. Beijing's restaurants are closed for dining in and some apartment blocks are sealed shut. The streets are quiet and the residents who do venture out have to show negative coronavirus tests to enter most public venues. Authorities are tracking down close contacts of confirmed cases, warning them to stay at home and contact authorities, and calling on everyone to abide by lockdown rules. China reported 7,822 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday, down from 8,329 new cases a day earlier, the National Health Commission said on Monday. All of China's 32 new deaths were in Shanghai, taking the country's overall death toll since the virus emerged to 5,092. India, the only country with a comparable population to China's 1.4 billion people, has officially recorded more than half a million deaths, though some health experts believe its toll is even higher.
