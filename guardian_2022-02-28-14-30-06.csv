2/28/2022,"Independent Zoe Daniel has appealed against a council ruling that political signs cannot be erected until the election is called, arguing it is inconsistent with its own advice and neighbouring councils which have allowed Josh Frydenberg signs. On Friday the Bayside City Council reversed its position on the sign stoush in the Goldstein electorate, ruling in favour of the Liberal MP Tim Wilson, who complained Daniel’s signs had been erected prematurely. The council now claims that because the House of Representatives election is not technically due until 3 September, signs put up before 3 June are unlawful – until the election is called. Daniel’s lawyers, Jonathan Evans QC and barrister Vicki Bell, have written a complaint arguing the council has used its power “to prevent political communication”, contrary to the practice of other councils in Melbourne. Daniel’s lawyers noted the presence of “a large number of signs … which promote the candidacy of the sitting member, Josh Frydenberg”. Glen Eira Council, which partly covers Goldstein, “has made no objection” to Daniel’s signs, they said, despite the council’s having rules identical to Bayside’s. The bylaws allow signs to be displayed for 14 days after an event or three months in total, whichever is sooner. A spokesperson for Frydenberg said: “We are abiding by local council rules.” Daniel’s legal advice also warned that Bayside’s interpretation of the rules is contrary to the implied freedom of political communication and the principles of statutory interpretation. It warned an inconsistent application of the rules would prevent “some Bayside residents from participating in the political process” – querying whether this is the council’s intention. Daniel’s lawyers argued the council has also contradicted written advice it gave to a councillor to pass on to one of her volunteers in December. On 10 December Matthew Cripps, director of city planning and amenity, noted “election signage is exempt from needing a planning permit” in an email which Daniel argues noted the relevant time limits but made “no reference to the election having to be called” or that signs are only allowed three months prior to the latest possible date of the election. “We are very concerned about the uncertainty, confusion and anger this issue has caused within the community, particularly in circumstances where Tim Wilson is making statements to the effect that local residents displaying signs will face ‘huge fines’ and council is now threatening to ‘undertake the action necessary to achieve compliance’,” Daniel’s complaint concluded. Last week Wilson wrote to his constituents accusing Daniel’s campaign of “ignoring the council” by allegedly unlawfully erecting signs before the election had been called, and urging them to dob in her supporters. Wilson had said: “I feel sorry for those households about to be fined nearly $1,000 each … because their candidate is knowingly encouraging them to break the law.” On Monday Wilson told Guardian Australia: “Council has advised us that if we erect signs we will be in breach of the law and get fined, so we have complied and not erected signs.” Wilson defended his warnings about fines, arguing it was “other candidates” encouraging their supporters to erect signs putting them at risk. “Any candidate with integrity would not seek political reward for knowingly breaking the law.” Consistent with earlier advice, @BaysideCouncil confirms election signs on homes need planning permits until poll is called, or 03/06 (<3 months 03/09). We’ve always obeyed this law. All candidates should show integrity & do the same. https://t.co/ksLeW6G1Zd On Thursday Glen Eira Council’s director of corporate services, Peter Swabey, told Guardian Australia it is “not aware of any complaints regarding a breach … of the planning scheme in relation to the issue which you have raised”.

2/28/2022,"In a new memoir, the former US attorney general William Barr says Donald Trump must not be the Republican candidate for president in 2024. The man he served between 2019 and 2020, Barr writes, has “shown he has neither the temperament nor persuasive powers to provide the kind of positive leadership that is needed”. Trump, Barr says, has surrounded himself with “sycophants” and “whack jobs from outside the government, who fed him a steady diet of comforting but unsupported conspiracy theories”. Trump hinted again on Saturday that he intends to run in 2024. He did not immediately comment on Barr’s analysis. Last summer, though, he called his former attorney general a “swamp creature” and a “Rino [Republican in Name Only] … afraid, weak and frankly … pathetic”. Barr’s book, One Damn Thing After Another: Memoirs of an Attorney General, will be published on 8 March, its title taken from a description of the job by Ed Levi, appointed by Gerald Ford after the Watergate scandal. The Wall Street Journal, like publisher Harper Collins owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, first reported Barr’s book on Sunday. The New York Times and Washington Post followed suit. A strong conservative, Barr was seen by most as a loyal servant to Trump, the second president he worked for after George HW Bush. The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren was among those who thought Barr way too loyal, calling him “a disgrace” and “not a credible head of federal law enforcement”. In his book, Barr rejects such accusations, prominently over the investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. Barr was accused of running interference for Trump, ultimately releasing a preemptory report summary which prompted an objection from the special counsel, Robert Mueller. According to the Times, Barr calls claims he interfered “drivel” and says it was a “simple fact that the president never did anything to interfere with the special counsel’s investigation”. Mueller, however, laid out extensive evidence of possible obstruction of justice by Trump, including the dangling of pardons. In his own report, the special counsel said he could not exonerate the president of trying to obstruct his work. Regarding Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about contacts with Russians, Barr writes: “Predictably our motion to dismiss the charges led to an election-year media onslaught, flogging the old theme that I was doing this as a favour to Trump. “But I concluded the handling of the Flynn matter by the FBI had been an abuse of power that no responsible AG could let stand.” A former judge appointed to review Barr’s move to dismiss disagreed, saying it was “clear evidence of a gross abuse of prosecutorial power” and represented “highly irregular conduct to benefit a political ally of the president”. Flynn was eventually pardoned by Trump and became a key player in the attempt to overturn the 2020 election. Barr also sought a more lenient sentence for the Trump ally Roger Stone, convicted of trying to obstruct the Russia investigation. Four prosecutors resigned but Barr insists in his book it was “reasonable” to act as he did. Stone’s sentence was ultimately commuted by Trump. Barr also describes a previously reported Oval Office meeting on 1 December 2020, at which Trump pressed his lie about electoral fraud in his defeat by Joe Biden. Barr had outraged many by using the Department of Justice to investigate Trump’s claims. But no evidence of widespread fraud was found and Barr used an interview with the Associated Press to say so. The same day, according to Barr’s book, Trump shouted: “This is killing me – killing me. This is pulling the rug right out from under me.” Echoing accounts of the meeting in Peril, by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, and Betrayal, by Jonathan Karl, Barr says the president slipped into the third person. “He stopped for a moment and then said, ‘You must hate Trump. You would only do this if you hate Trump.’” Barr says he told Trump he had “sacrificed a lot personally to come in to help you when I thought you were being wronged”, but could not support the lie about electoral fraud. After Trump listed other grievances, Barr offered to resign – an offer not reported by Karl or Woodward and Costa. Trump, Barr writes, yelled “Accepted!”, banged his palm on a table and said: “Leave and don’t go back to your office. You are done right now. Go home!” Barr says White House lawyers persuaded Trump not to allow him to quit. Barr finally resigned on 14 December, nearly two weeks later. On 6 January 2021, after Trump spoke at a rally near the White House, the Capitol was attacked. Seven people died around the riot and more than 100 police officers were hurt. More than 700 people have been charged, 11 with seditious conspiracy. Trump was impeached, for inciting an insurrection. In his book, Barr says: “The absurd lengths to which [Trump] took his ‘stolen election’ claim led to the rioting on Capitol Hill.” But he also says Trump’s behaviour did not meet the legal standard for an incitement charge.",Arts/Books,William Barr uses new book to outline case against Trump White House run,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/28/william-barr-book-trump-electoral-fraud-lie-michael-flynn-russia
2/28/2022,"In a string of phone calls from a besieged Kyiv, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has persuaded the west to agree to a set of sanctions against Russia that were inconceivable a week ago. Sensing how European public opinion is responding to the bravery of his people, Zelenskiy has been constantly on the phone to western leaders, using his Twitter feed to cajole, encourage, scold and praise his allies. In the process, sanctions regarded as unthinkable a week ago have become a moral baseline. The pace at which the west has been agreeing to the new sanctions has also left the lawyers, officials and bankers gasping for air, officials admit, as they work under severe pressure to turn headlines into reality. One leader’s office said: “We are in awe of him. He may not eventually be able to save Ukraine, or change Russia, but he is changing Europe.” Take Saturday’s diplomacy. Zelensky said he opened another day on the diplomatic frontline with a phone call to Emmanuel Macron, followed as the day progressed with calls to the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, the president of Switzerland, Ignazio Cassis, the prime minister of India, Narendra Modi, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Azerbaijani president, Ilham Aliyev, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the Pope, the Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, the Polish prime minister, Andrzej Duda, and finally a virtual nightcap with the British prime minister. The day before, the number of calls was similar, all focused on requests for arms and tougher sanctions. Quite how Zelenskiy managed to make these calls, rally the home front, direct his army and sleep is hard to fathom. One who has heard him in action says: “He is very direct, very passionate and very practical.” But the calls have produced golden rewards for Zelenskiy and helped turn the tide. The pace of societal change quickens in most wars, but to watch Germany in the space of week take a 180 degree turn and back arms sales to Ukraine, vow to increase defence spending to 2% of GDP and agree to cut Russia off from Swift is not just a set of extraordinary policy changes, it marks a watershed in a post-second world war mindset. Equally, the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, emphasising earlier in the week the need for the long-term solutions necessary to wean Italy off Russian gas, realised the previous political opposition to tougher immediate measures had evaporated. His office reject reports that he mounted strong objections to Russia being cut off from Swift, saying the issue had not seriously been pressed at meetings at the G7 leaders last week, But they admit that Zelenskiy, through his resourcefulness, and Russia, by its arrogance, had handed the initiative to countries like the UK, Canada and France to sway others to accept that Russia could be cut off from the Swift payments systems. On Saturday night the identity of the Russian banks likely to be cut was still being settled, but Gazbank, critical to energy transactions, is likely to be excluded. But perhaps the most devastating measure being considered did not come directly from Zelensky’s relentless lobbying. Some European leaders believe it will be the wholly unexpected freeze on the assets of the Russian central bank, the single most important Russian financial institution, that will prove the unravelling of Putin’s economy. One European official said: “It was kept in our back pocket, but it is going to mean a run on the ruble on Monday that they will not contain.” Another official admitted the long-term chances of the Ukrainian military being able to hold out against the vastly superior Russian forces are limited. The true goal is to make the price for Putin economically and politically so cripplingly high that he is forced to realise he cannot win on his terms.",News/World news,The phone has become the Ukrainian president’s most effective weapon,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/the-phone-has-become-the-ukrainian-presidents-most-effective-weapon
2/28/2022,"On the edge of one of Brittany’s poorest housing estates, a six-year-old girl sits in class and works on her handwriting. Her teacher, Lucile, encourages her as 11 other children sit around tables, arranged into cosy nooks. “Every day I listen to each child read to me, I never managed that when I had 25 in a class,” said Lucile. “I get to know each child individually and it’s so calm.” It is in classrooms like this, in France’s most deprived neighbourhoods, that the centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, wants his record in office to be considered. When he came to power five years ago – a former banker who had served as economy minister under the left – he promised a “pragmatic” cherrypicking of ideas from both left and right that would liberalise the economy and end the persistent inequality that he said “imprisoned” people by their social origins. Now, as he faces an April re-election battle dominated by concerns over the cost of living, social protections and how to make ends meet; his policy of slashing school class sizes to help disadvantaged children has become key to Macron showing he has not only governed for the elite. The 1960s school building surrounded by tower-block housing estates in the city of Rennes, symbolises the poverty trap that has become one of France’s most enduring problems. A child born and schooled in a deprived neighbourhood in France has less chance of escaping their socio-economic background than in most other developed nations, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). When Macron took office in 2017, he promised the biggest overhaul of France’s social model and welfare system in modern history, and swiftly loosened the country’s strict labour laws by decree. Such pro-business policies, in tandem with his transformation of the wealth tax into a property tax, saw him labelled as the “president of the rich”. Then came two massive crises – first the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) anti-government revolt, followed by the pandemic, which has killed more than 130,000 people in France. Macron quickly turned to state interventionism and vast public spending while boasting of “nationalising wages” to keep the country afloat. France’s economy has started bouncing back from Covid faster than expected. Unemployment is down, and the US economist Paul Krugman has called France the “star performer” of the major advanced economies in the pandemic era. But amid inflation, rising fuel prices, record distrust of the political class, society divisions and growing identity politics on the far right, Macron remains under pressure to prove that his five years in office did, as he claims, “protect” people from all backgrounds. Les Gantelles primary school in Rennes is one of the thousands of schools in deprived “priority education zones” where Macron cut class sizes in half for five-, six-, and seven-year-olds learning to read and count – guaranteeing no more than 12 children per teacher as a way to level the education gap in one of the most unequal school systems in the developed world. Macron’s entourage presents it as his defining social measure – even recognised by some opponents such as the rightwing presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse. In the corridors of Les Gantelles, independent of politics, staff also approved of the change. “From a human perspective, teaching is more personalised, the atmosphere is more conducive to learning and there’s an increased level of wellbeing among children in class,” said Dominique Dubray, the school’s headteacher. She would like small classes of 15 children throughout the whole school and across the country. “That’s my dream.” But Alain Landeau, a school inspector in Rennes, cautioned that the results could only be fully measured in the much longer term. “It undeniably changed the atmosphere – it’s very relaxed in these classes, you feel that teachers and pupils feel good. In terms of classroom mood, it has been spectacular,” said Landeau. The Maurepas housing estates near the school are among the most disadvantaged in Brittany, a region that is otherwise booming – buoyed by agriculture, food processing, electronics, car assembly and tourism – which will prove key to Macron’s re-election campaign. Its tradition of pro-European, centre-left politics gave Macron some of his highest scores in the last presidential race in 2017, alongside the Paris region. Key Brittany figures, including the foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, will play a role in Macron’s re-election campaign. But Brittany, with its well-developed network of charities and grassroots associations that stepped in to help those suffering during the pandemic, also symbolises just how difficult life has become for many French people in the past two years. “The Covid crisis was very revealing,” said Pheng Ly, who works for the association La Cohue, set up to provide a meeting place, activities and job support for the Gros Chêne estate in Maurepas, which is undergoing renovation. “The pandemic showed up existing inequalities in deprived neighbourhoods like this where many people live below the poverty line, and where since the 1960s, poverty and misery has been concentrated in one small perimeter.” Since the pandemic began, La Cohue has facilitated food parcel handouts. Marie, a retired high school cleaner, 68, who did not want to give her real name, had queued to take home yoghurts, eggs and potato salad. “My pension is €600, and after paying €400 in rent, then bills like gas and water, I can’t afford food,” she said. “I queue for handouts and add a bit of pasta to it at home. I’m angry and exhausted.” To her, Macron does not understand people’s daily lives and struggles. She had believed the government’s promise to introduce a minimum pension of €1,000 a month for those who had worked all their lives. But Macron’s proposed pensions overhaul led to protests that lasted longer than any strike since the wildcat workers’ stoppages of 1968, and the change was shelved during the pandemic. Marie feels immigration has worsened problems in France, and was tempted by the far right. Divisions in society remain. Macron’s response to terrorism and the 2020 beheading of the schoolteacher Samuel Paty was to introduce tough legislation against religious separatism, which has caused concern to some rights groups. Reports of anti-Muslim acts increased by 32% in 2021. Macron was elected over the far-right Marine Le Pen in 2017, saying in his victory speech he would ensure people had “no more reason to vote for extremes”. But five years on, the far-right competition has morphed and grown; Macron is now facing two such candidates, Le Pen and a newcomer, TV pundit Eric Zemmour, who has been convicted for inciting racial hatred. From his office in the National Assembly, Florian Bachelier, the MP for Rennes and one of the Breton figures in Macron’s close circle, said the pandemic had left French people traumatised in many ways and the whole country was “conscious of our individual and collective vulnerabilities”. A former lawyer, he listed policy measures that he argued had improved French people’s daily lives, including developing apprenticeships for young people, lowering income tax, scrapping the housing tax for many French people and extending paternity leave to 28 days. “What stands out is that the president has protected the French – even more so during the turbulent times of the pandemic,” he said. But Bachelier, who as France’s “first quaestor” manages the finances and administration of the National Assembly, is also well placed to measure the growing mood of distrust towards elected officials. He has made a series of legal complaints over threats against him amid a rise in death threats against French lawmakers from all parties. Bachelier said rebuilding trust with the electorate required “showing we keep our promises and that we’re working in the general interest”. The gilets jaunes revolt, which began in autumn 2018 and ran into 2019, was a turning point in Macron’s presidency. What started as an anti-fuel tax movement became a long-running anti-government protest sparking the worst street unrest in Paris in decades. “Where we succeeded was showing politicians there was a France that was suffering,” said Tristan Lozach, from his home near Saint-Brieuc. Lozach was 26 when he became a key organiser for northern Brittany’s gilets jaunes, protesting on roundabouts and outside shopping centres. He had grown up in children’s homes and the care system, and worked as a funeral operative, dressing and preparing the deceased for their relatives – a job he found purpose and pride in. But with his salary, he could not make ends meet or pay petrol bills. “There were a lot of people in France who were afraid to say they were suffering or living in misery, the protests allowed them to speak out,” he said. “And I think it changed Emmanuel Macron. He doesn’t speak to the public the same way as he did three years ago, when he would make comments to people he met in the street that came across as disdain.” But with inflation and rising fuel prices, Lozach said he was struggling even more today than during the protests in 2018. He received the government’s recent one-off “premium” of €100 to protect low-income workers from rising energy prices. “But you can’t live on an occasional anti-inflation cheque – you need long-term solutions”. He and a handful of local gilets jaunes have been back on roundabouts or hanging banners over motorway bridges “to show we’re still here”. In nearby Plédran, Julien Rouxel, 22, is preparing to take over the small dairy farm that has been in his family for five generations. He is optimistic for the future, but had been out supporting the pig and dairy farmers on recent tractor protests against supermarkets accused of not giving fair prices for produce. “I just want to farm and be able to pay my costs,” he said. “Emmanuel Macron – poor guy – I’m not criticising him because he’s had a lot on his plate and he did his best. But I suppose the question is: did he listen enough to French people? Perhaps not.” In the thriving centre of Rennes, Goulwen Lorcy could be seen as an example of Macron’s key soundbite of making France a “startup nation”. Lorcy’s small Brittany startup launched before the pandemic to create digital systems to re-allocate unused medicines between hospitals. But when the pandemic hit, he and his team of young developers were called in by the state to rapidly create a similar system linking hospitals in France. “It brought us the recognition that start-ups can be more reactive than big companies in inventing new solutions very quickly,” Lorcy said. He noted that during the pandemic, many “solutions were regional”, not just filtering down from Paris. Romain Pasquier, a political scientist at Sciences Po Rennes, said Macron’s top-down style of governance had been “extremely centralised”. He said regions with a strong identity and local language, such as Brittany, had been angered at the education ministry’s reticence last summer over the immersive teaching of regional languages in schools. Meanwhile, Macron’s party is preparing campaign material to remind voters of the various measures it has put in place; from the increase in the justice budget to the €300 “culture pass” for 15- to 18-year-olds to spend on the arts. On another Rennes housing estate, Emmanuel Curet is a youth social worker in a key sports association. “If you do sport, there’s less chance of being in the shit,” he said. He was, as a rule, sceptical of political parties, he said. But asked if anything had changed in the five years under Macron, Curet mentions youth training and apprenticeship programmes. Several young people had been able to train and were hired by his association. His 18-year-old son was an apprentice printer. “It’s an efficient tool in getting young people on the road to a career and salary,” said Curet. “That has changed things.”",News/World news,"As election looms, can Macron show he has governed for all for France?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/as-election-looms-can-macron-show-he-has-governed-for-all-for-france
2/28/2022,"Last Monday, Oleh Synehubov was wearing a sharp suit with a neatly knotted mauve tie, sitting in an overfurnished room in the grand regional administration building in Kharkiv, and discussing his plans for his region’s next quarterly budget. Five days later, he was giving a video address to citizens wearing combat fatigues, heralding the repulsion of Russian forces from Ukraine’s second-largest city, and announcing that anyone on the streets after 6pm would be “liquidated”, as the Ukrainian army attempted to weed out saboteur groups in the city. It was a week of grim transformation for the lives of almost every Ukrainian, after Vladimir Putin’s decision to launch a ruthless assault on the supposed “brotherly nation” of Ukraine, which began in the early hours of Thursday morning. Hundreds of thousands have fled to the west of the country to avoid Putin’s advancing troops and missiles, with many spending long hours in queues at checkpoints on the way and at the borders with Poland and Hungary. Many more have stayed and made the decision to fight. “I’ll be honest, I’m really scared. It’s the first time I’ve held a gun,” said 50-year-old Alexander, brandishing a shotgun at a barricade near a village outside Kyiv on Saturday. Behind him, an elderly man looked out across nearby fields through a pair of binoculars, while women were preparing crates of molotov cocktails, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. The speed and effectiveness with which so many Ukrainians have mobilised have been an impressive sight, particularly as so few people genuinely believed Putin could launch such an all-embracing attack on the country. True, he had been massing troops around Ukraine’s borders for the past three months, and US and British intelligence released ever more apocalyptic warnings of the scale of what Putin was planning. But for a whole range of reasons, many people in Ukraine – like many outside observers – found it hard to believe in the possibility of what transpired, partly because it did not seem to fit into any comprehensible scenario. “Russia is bombing Kyiv. Russia is bombing Kyiv.” People muttered the sentence again and again this week, the intonation changing from confusion, to disbelief, to anger. For those who have stayed behind in the capital, life is now filled with daily struggles they hardly imagined possible. A week ago, Kristina Berdynskykh, perhaps the best-connected political journalist in Ukraine, was sharing insider gossip with visiting correspondents over cocktails in Kyiv. By Sunday evening, Berdynskykh was preparing for her fourth consecutive night sleeping in one of suburban Kyiv’s metro stations, along with her 67-year-old mother. There were about 200 people sleeping in the station, she said, with the prized places the benches on a metro train parked on one of the platforms with its doors open. Her family arrived too late for those, so are sleeping on blankets on the floor. Each station has a police guard, and the atmosphere is calm. For Berdynskykh, as for most Ukrainians, the severity of the Russian attack came as a shock. “I thought there was going to be Russian military action, but I expected it to be in the Donbas,” she said. Some of the few Kyiv residents who genuinely feared this sort of war could be on the way were people who were displaced from Donbas after the conflict in 2014. Anna, 35, fled Donetsk eight years ago, a few months after Russia-backed proxies took over the city. Two weeks ago, she admitted to feeling a sense of dread that history could repeat itself. “I’m worried about how calm everyone is, I have deja vu. Back in Donetsk, nobody thought war was possible either, until the last moment. And then it came,” she said. On Sunday, Anna was just arriving in a city in western Ukraine, after an arduous two-day car journey across the country with her two cats in tow. She hopes her stay will be temporary and she will not have to start her life from scratch once more. The first sign from Moscow that war was imminent came last Monday, when Putin appeared on television to host a startlingly bizarre sitting of Russia’s security council. It was less a discussion and more a forced swearing of loyalty to his aggressive new Ukraine policy by a court of pliant underlings. Some of them appeared to be enthusiastic cheerleaders while others looked like hostages to their leader’s increasingly whimsical autocratic ways. This was quickly followed by a televised speech in which Putin ranted about Ukrainian history, grievances against the west and the need to protect the population in the Donbas, eastern Ukraine. Many people expected a limited offensive in the Donbas, at least until a pretext could be found for more escalation. But the new Putin appears not to be particularly bothered with pretexts. Instead, he launched straight into a major assault on Ukraine, with tanks rolling across the borders, missiles aimed at Kyiv, and a series of increasingly alarming messages from the commander in chief. By Sunday, these had culminated with the terrifying threat to put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert, acceded to with an uneasy nod by defence minister Sergei Shoigu. In Ukraine, people are still processing these twists. Many are still confused at how their world has been turned on its head in a matter of days. Amid the grim new reality, some people tried to cling on to the vestiges of past normality. In the only open petrol station close to the capital on the Kyiv-Odesa highway on Saturday, the cashier shouted exasperatedly at a throng of patrons trying to buy petrol. “Have some respect and wear a facemask,” she shouted at the crowds trying to get access to the pumps. She was roundly ignored. A few minutes later, an announcement came over the loudspeaker: “This petrol station is now closing. Petrol will be available only for members of the Ukrainian armed forces who present a special permit.” Further along the highway, close to the Vasilkiv airbase where a Russian attempt to land paratroopers was reportedly fought off by the Ukrainian army on Saturday morning, a supermarket was open and felt almost normal, with a well-stocked exotic fruit section and gift-wrapped novelty chocolates for sale. Outside, there were several smashed up cars on the road, one that had been shot up, and makeshift roadblocks to stop Russia landing planes on the highway. The vestiges of the pre-war life are likely to fade further if Russia’s assault grinds on or intensifies. Already, the fuel and food shortage is chronic in and around Kyiv. Most shops have no bread and the long weekend curfew left many people scrabbling to make do with whatever food they had at home. The mood at the makeshift barricades set up along the roads outside the capital has become increasingly edgy as sleep-deprived and nervous civilians, many of them holding a weapon for the first time, keep a lookout for Russian sabotage groups. For now, though, spirits mostly remain high, as Ukrainians share videos of destroyed Russian hardware, Ukrainian soldiers launching insulting tirades against Putin, and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s inspiring amateur videos proving he has not fled. Mykhailo, a volunteer manning a checkpoint in central Ukraine, summed up the mood among many during the heady first days of the fightback: “We didn’t want this. We didn’t expect this. But now it’s happened, we will battle with everything we have,” he said.",News/World news,From budgets and cocktails to all-out war: Ukraine’s week of grim transformation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/from-budgets-and-cocktails-to-all-out-war-ukraines-week-of-grim-transformation
