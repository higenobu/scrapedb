1/9/2022,"A bid by the Morrison government to delay Novak Djokovic’s visa hearing by two days has been rejected by the federal circuit court. In an order, published on Sunday, judge Anthony Kelly rejected the move which would have delayed the hearing until Wednesday – after Tennis Australia’s stated deadline to include the world number one in the Australian Open draw.  But legal experts have warned even with the hearing proceeding on Monday, there is no guarantee Djokovic could secure a court order restoring his visa in time to play. The Serbian star could also face his visa being revoked again on fresh grounds. The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, applied to the court for the case to be delayed but the judge rejected that in an order made on Saturday – although he left open the option of the government trying again after Djokovic’s opening submissions at 10am on Monday. If the current timetable remains in place, the government’s lawyers will present oral submissions on Monday afternoon. The court heard on Thursday that Tennis Australia had said it would need to know whether Djokovic could compete by Tuesday for scheduling purposes. Kelly said at that time he would try to accommodate the parties to come to a resolution but stressed the court would not be rushed. “The tail won’t be wagging the dog here,” he said. The Australian government on Sunday confirmed that Czech doubles specialist Renata Voracova and a tennis official, both of who travelled to attend the Australian Open, had left the country voluntarily after their visas were cancelled. The health minister, Greg Hunt, told reporters border force had now finished its investigation into Australian Open visas. He would not comment on Djokovic’s case because that matter was before the court. “Two other individuals have now voluntarily left the country … any individual who has their visa cancelled is entitled to leave the country at any time, even while they are going through a court proceeding, but that is a matter for them,” Hunt said. Djokovic obtained a medical exemption to compete in the Australian Open but then fell foul of Australian border rules – which require arrivals to be fully vaccinated unless they can prove a valid exemption. He is currently in immigration detention at the Park hotel in Melbourne. Djokovic’s court challenge seeks to argue that errors in the notice of intention to cancel his visa and in the home affairs minister’s delegate’s decision mean the visa must be reinstated. Refugee lawyer and the founder of Human Rights for All, Alison Battison, said if Djokovic won on Monday the government should respect the court’s decision rather than “seek to wriggle around by finding another way to cancel his visa”. “What we do know, however, with our dealings with the department of home affairs is that is often not the case,” she warned, citing three instances she had won in the federal court only for the minister to find a fresh reason to cancel a visa. Battison suggested it would be “extraordinary” if the court decided the case in time for the Australian Open deadline as it was hearing “a visa issue not a playing tennis issue” and other urgent cases took weeks – at a minimum – to be resolved. Battison argued Djokovic was experiencing the “draconian” way Australia runs immigration appeals which were “stacked against” the applicant in detention without access to documents. Former immigration department deputy secretary, Abul Rizvi, said he would be “surprised” if the government cancelled Djokovic’s visa again in the event the world No 1 succeeded on Monday. “They’d have to find another reason or it would be contemptuous of court,” he said. Rizvi said it was “possible” Djokovic might not have a result by the deadline but “his lawyers will argue that he can’t be left in detention while the judge cogitates on it”. A spokesman for Andrews told Guardian Australia: “As the matter is before the court, it is not appropriate to comment at this time.”",Sport/Sport,Australian government fails in bid to delay Novak Djokovic court hearing by two days,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/09/australian-government-fails-in-bid-to-delay-novak-djokovic-court-hearing-by-two-days
1/9/2022,"New year, new plot, new soil. We have been exiled now from the allotment site for six weeks or so. Another six weeks – we hope – to go. Locked out from working land in winter, from digging and planting. Just being there. The garden rituals and camaraderie that get us through. I pine for the plot but we are currently persona non grata. A survey discovered asbestos on ours and another nearby allotment site. I suspect it is perhaps not uncommon in London. There were council plans at first to build raised beds but costs put paid to that.  In mid-November, planning permission was given for the plots to be covered with geotextile and half a metre of new soil. The earth work we have done is now buried. I walk close to the gate sometimes. I almost press my face to the future. Everything we could save is sitting waiting on the banks at the edge of the plots. Tree and other treasured plants have been potted. Impatient on our return. Structures have been packed away. Fruit cages now without fruit. Poles waiting for beans and peas. In homes around north London, cuttings and saved seed sit quietly. There will be work to do to bring the new soil to life. To invite worms to return. Organic matter to add. At least, for now, it is winter. I wonder about the foxes, the feral cats, the owls, our robins and other birds. Where the other gardeners are. What plans they’re making for the new growing season. We have uprooted fennel and verbena waiting in Howard’s greenhouse. At least now we will have to thoroughly sort the seed. New life will return. The new year will see the return of old and new allotmenteers. Heads full of plans. Plot 29 will be carefully unpacked. Much-loved plants from before will be re-homed. New plots and new planting. New life will return. Until then at least, there is last year’s amaranth seed to sort. Allan Jenkins’s Plot 29 (4th Estate, £9.99) is out now.

1/9/2022,"Viña Indomita Gran Reserva Carignan, Maule Valley Chile, 2019 (£8, The Co-op) If some of us have been persuaded of the merits of treating January as an experiment in abstinence (up to 6.5m, or one in five UK adults, according to a poll taken before last year’s ‘Dry January’ campaign), there are many more who would make a convincing case for the opposite course of action. I’m not advocating that everyone maintains Christmas-level tippling every day and night past New Year’s Eve. But there is a reasonable line of thinking that says that this dark, cold, skint time of year may not be the best moment to deprive ourselves of one of life’s simpler pleasures. Moderation may be a more effective route to long-term healthy drinking, allowing us to lift our spirits with a glass or two of a moderately priced, delicious southern-sun filled red such as Indomita’s. Tesco Finest GSM, McLaren Vale Australia, 2017 (£9, Tesco) Chile remains one of the most reliable sources of inexpensive red wines of the softly textured kind that are the antidote to seasonal dankness – the sort that works as well on the sofa as it does at the table, such as Morrisons The Best Chilean Carmenère 2020 (£6.50), which makes it a good match for pizza. Also doing the job in the very specific category of ‘wines for TV and takeaway’ is the perfumed malbec from Argentina. Aldi Argentinian Malbec, Mendoza 2020 (£5.79) is one of the best-value versions of the style. Australia, too, has its way with the fruity, warming genre, although the best of the Down Under supermarket bunch tends to come seasoned with a lick of peppery spice, such as Tesco’s ever-excellent blend of grenache, shiraz and mataro.  Domaine Gayda Chemin de Moscou, IGP Pays d’Oc France, 2019 (£25.99, Cambridge Wine Merchants) The GSM blend based on grenache and/or shiraz plus mataro and others is the base of many of Australia’s finest reds. But its origins are in southern France, producing wines that can feel like a transfusion of mood-boosting sunlight at this time of year. You can get some of that Mediterranean hillside feel in bottles from the Languedoc, such as Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Saint-Chinian (£9), or from the Rhône Valley, such as Marks & Spencer’s superb Les Closiers Lirac 2019 (£10). That’s true, too, of the latest vintage of one of my favourite wines from one of my favourite Languedoc producers. The darkly concentrated, blackberry, black olive, pepper and rosemary of Domaine Gayda’s Chemin de Mouscou, served with roast lamb, is my prescription for seeing off the winter blues.

1/9/2022,"Manteca, 49-51 Curtain Road, London EC2A 3PT (020 7033 6642). Snacks and small plates £3-£10; large plates £13-£36; desserts £5-£8; wines from £28 An email arrives from Australia. Greg declares himself a fan of this column. He also happens to be a newspaper subeditor and he’s noticed something. It’s the repeated use of a certain word. That word is “punchy”. By repeated I don’t mean just one or two uses. He has found 11 examples from the past six months. I have referenced punchy sauces and punchy Thai green curries, punchy loveliness and both a punchy affair and a punchy mess. Oh, the shame. I am clearly punch drunk. I could excuse myself. There are only so many words in the world. But that’s no excuse at all. So thank you, Greg. Today I’m officially announcing the retirement of punchy. It’s going straight from this page to a home for knackered adjectives, where it will share a room with “mouth-watering” and “sumptuous”. I wish it a happy retirement.  I’m glad Greg emailed because, had he not, I’m certain I would have made it the dozen. The food at Manteca, a self-styled nose-to-tail Italian in London’s Shoreditch, serves food which demands all the big, rumbustious words. It’s less a menu and more of a horn section. Every dish, every snack and small plate, every bowl of pasta, side and sharing platter, arrives with a tap dance and a huge ta-da! Manteca doesn’t do subtle or restrained. It does dinner. And it’s bloody marvellous. The restaurant is a collaboration between David Carter, best known for the deep-glazed barbecue glories of Smokestak, and chef Chris Leach, who has time at Pitt Cue and Kitty Fisher’s on his CV. It started with a couple of residences in the centre of London (including one in the location now occupied by Sarap Bistro, reviewed last week). This is what it was all aiming at: a sandy-coloured, sexily lit space of clatter and crash, with an open kitchen and, downstairs in the basement, a glass-walled hanging cabinet for all the cured meats made on site. We are wooed by curls of their baby-pink mortadella with ivory gems of fat and a smoky speck sliced so thinly it’s almost lacy. With it comes their springy, oily crusted focaccia. All is very good. The parade of small plates starts with puntarelle, that crunchy and lightly bitter member of the chicory family, done in the Roman style, which is to say dazzled and boosted by an anchovy and fresh chilli vinaigrette, which leaves you wondering why you used up all the damn bread on the salumi. Our waiter notices and brings more, cut in swabs designed for sauce mopping. It comes in handy for the next dish, the mere name of which is an outrageous act of lusty flirtation: pig skin ragu with parmesan and crispy skin. The latter is a plate-sized piece of dehydrated skin that has been inflated in the deep-fat fryer. We break it up and use it to scoop away at the massive flavour bomb of a slow-cooked, reduced and intensified ragu, under its blizzard of aged parmesan. At ordering I was asked if I would like it with shavings of black truffle for an extra £6. Because I don’t know the meaning of “enough, already”, I said yes, of course I would like the extra black truffle. The measured hum of truffle gets deliriously swept away by the breaking wave of the ragu. We have a brick of pig’s head croquette, made with all the meaty bits and the sticky bits, which comes with a dish of pilacca, a fiery Italian hot sauce that might, involuntarily, make you say gosh. There is a puffy, billowing flatbread which isn’t very flat at all, studded with sweet salty clams. Almost all the pasta dishes come in small portions at around £9, or large at £14. We share three of the small, starting with the Manteca take on the popular old stager cacio e pepe. Here the pepper-boosted sauce, which clings adoringly to the fat noodles, has been mixed through with rust-coloured brown crab meat to give it a deep, savoury kick rather than a seafood tang. It strikes me that if they had attempted to serve this dish in Rome, they would have been run out of town, or invited on a tour of the Colosseum to meet some underfed lions specifically re-introduced to the arena for the purpose. Ah, but we are not in Rome. We are in Shoreditch where brazen innovation is fully embraced. The nearest thing to a mellow dish is the cappellacci di zucca, the pasta stuffed with a sweet squash purée and sprinkled with an amaretti crumb so it becomes a plateful hinged between savoury and dessert. Then there are the silky, butter-yellow folds of fazzoletti with a powerful duck ragu with duck fat and crisp duck skin. It’s the love child resulting from a raucous night of unbridled shagging between a prim Roman pasta dish and a blousy cassoulet from Toulouse. By this point we’ve rather lost a grip on what is reasonable. We really don’t need the flame-grilled chop of old ewe, with its glistening fat the colour of polished alabaster and its rosy meat and, on the side, the homemade lamb sausage that, like a great novel, is full of depth and meaning. Then again if this column concerned itself with issues of need, the whole damn premise would collapse. We are, however, restrained at dessert and merely share a piece of warm, crumbly honey cake with a scoop of salted caramel ice-cream. And a scoop of lemon sorbet, because that’s always a good idea. The wine list is divided, rather knowingly, between “classics” and “down the rabbit hole”. I appreciate this. It enables me to stay with the classics and avoid wines that will make me cross and shouty and boring. It’s hardly rich in bargains, but there is depth. Manteca is a well-seasoned restaurant masquerading as a new one. Those extended residences mean Leach and Carter got to stress-test their idea to breaking point. The result is genuinely bold and exciting. For days before my dinner, I read and re-read the menu online, wondering whether the promise of the words – pig skin ragu, brown crab cacio e pepe and so on – could be realised on the plate. Or would it turn out to be just so much empty menu writing? It’s nothing of the sort. I left feeling I’d been fed by people with genuine verve and originality. I’d go so far as to say I felt paunchy. I said PAUNCHY. For God’s sake, can’t you people read?

1/9/2022,"Phillip Inman strikes exactly the right note on the so-called levelling-up agenda (“It’s hard to ‘level up’ when No 10 is bearing down on us”, Business). If Michael Gove and co focus on structures rather than activity, outputs and outcomes, levelling up will struggle to get off the ground. Let’s also accept that meaningful activities, outputs and outcomes are in any case hard to achieve, given tough economic times, short-term political life cycles and economic and social inequities. If funding is to be properly channelled to relatively poor regions and localities, a government with less centralised control tendencies would be welcome. Beyond cities and regions with mayors and to avoid the inevitable mess and cost of too much restructuring, maybe it’s time to trust local authorities with regeneration activity and the like. Wouldn’t that be something after more than a decade of devastating cuts to local services? Central government could require local plans, a reporting process and some incentives or curbs, depending on progress. Even better, local people could have some involvement through existing consultation methods and citizen assemblies could be tried out. This approach might just stand a fighting chance of making a real difference.Steve WestFordingbridge, Hampshire  Phillip Inman rightly draws attention to the problems with levelling up the north. Some of the problems lie here in Oxford, where donors seemingly queue up to fund new establishments, leading to all sorts of problems with affordable housing and undesirable green-belt development. Sometimes, the investment is very much to the good (there will be soon be millions more invested in vaccinology, for example), but the Oxford/Cambridge/London research and development triangle grows apace while universities elsewhere often struggle to find funds. A combined government and private enterprise initiative to divert research money to, say, Bristol, Birmingham and Sheffield would be welcome, though I cannot see our Oxford-based political establishment agreeing to this, alas.Don ManleyOxford With Vanessa Thorpe’s interesting article about Pauline Baer de Perignon’s sleuthing to recover her family’s Nazi-looted art, another piece of the jigsaw of wartime art theft falls into place (“The amateur sleuth, the galleries and a fight for family art looted by the Nazis”, News). I am reading the seminal work on the subject of Nazi art theft and the fate of Europe’s treasures in the Second World War, The Rape of Europa by Lynn H Nicholas. It must have been an influence on the making of the film The Monuments Men because so many events recorded in the book are portrayed in the film. The book is a masterwork of research, explaining the convoluted schemes to illegally acquire much of the patrimony of the conquered nations of Europe. It also explains the Allied programme for rescue, repatriation and restitution by “the monuments men” and their work with museum curators in the liberated nations. There are many unrecovered treasures from the period that perhaps will come to light, not least because of the diligent and persistent endeavours of people such as Pauline Baer de Perignon.Paul F FaupelSomersham, Cambridgeshire Your piece about school uniforms in Kerala was informative and insightful (“Unisex school uniforms come to Kerala. But some parents aren’t happy…”, World). It was also instructive, inadvertently, in illustrating gender-based assumptions in supposedly non-gendered thinking. Why is it that “unisex” and “gender-neutral” clothing is nearly always based on what is worn traditionally by boys/men? Obvious answers will refer to the disinhibiting practicality for girls and the need to disrupt the tendency to equate power and capability with items worn by boys. They are liberating interventions in the context of sexism. Just as there is nothing inherently male about trousers, there is nothing inherently female about a skirt or dress. Despite greater sensitivities about gender fluidity, gender-neutral clothing is still modelled on “male” norms. If we conceive of unisex clothing in terms of what girls must wear, and model gender-neutral clothing on what boys have worn, we should not be surprised if our children learn a lopsided message.Paul McGilchristColchester, Essex In his interview with Robin McKie, infectious diseases expert Professor Mark Woolhouse makes a valid public health observation (“Britain got it wrong on Covid: long lockdown did more harm than good, says scientist”, News). However, what is missing is the political dimension of the decision-making process. While it was obvious in March 2020 that the global public health machinery was mobilised to combat the pandemic it had prepared for, rather than the one it was presented with, for the UK government to have admitted this would have shone a light on the consequences of its policies over the previous 10 years. Care homes should have been fortified, with enough skilled staff to safeguard residents. To have done so would have laid bare the working conditions, low pay and zero-hours contracts that facilitated the spread of Covid among those least able to cope. Infected patients were returned to care homes because the NHS had been so poorly funded that there was no slack in the system. While labour deregulation led to infected people having to continue working and concomitant poverty resulting in vulnerable people living in multi-generational households. All this overseen by a government (and party) whose inability to manage anything is only eclipsed by its willingness to lie.David HoareKingston, Lewes, Sussex Anne McElvoy’s interesting piece on Keir Starmer omits any reference to local government, which has suffered significantly over the last 11 years and faces more cuts (“Starmer is making headway, but has he got enough to worry the Tories?”, Comment). Councils are facing the prospect of having to continue to reduce staffing and services across the communities they struggle to support. It’s time the media began to cover the damage being inflicted by the government in this area of public policy.Jeremy BeechamNewcastle City CouncilGosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne I’m a great admirer of Sir Lindsay Hoyle.

1/9/2022,"Eric Adams has promised to restore “swagger” to New York, the city he has run as mayor for barely a week. In that brief time, he has also attracted fierce criticism and flirted with scandal. As deputy mayor for public safety, Adams appointed a former top police chief who resigned during a federal investigation.  Adams, a former NYPD officer himself, also made his own brother a deputy police commissioner. In further controversy, Adams’s pick for New York police commissioner, Keechant Sewell, the first woman to fill the post, has clashed with the Manhattan district attorney over proposed criminal justice reforms. Adams’s pick for the public safety post is Philip Banks III. In 2014, he resigned from the NYPD after being named as an unindicted co-conspirator in an FBI corruption investigation. On Friday, Banks sought to dispel questions about his involvement in that scandal, which included questions about deposits totaling $300,000 in bank accounts belonging to him and his wife. “I never broke the law, nor did I ever betray the public trust by abusing my authority as an NYPD official,” Banks wrote in the New York Daily News. “From here on, I promise all New Yorkers that I will let my hard work be the evidence of my commitment.” Mayor Adams’s brother, Bernard Adams, is a retired NYPD sergeant who most recently worked as assistant director of operations for parking and transportation at the medical campus of Virginia Commonwealth University. He was appointed as deputy police commissioner with a $240,000-a-year salary – exposing the mayor to accusations of nepotism. Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York, a good governance group, told City & State: “New Yorkers expect that public servants are hired based on their unique qualifications and not because they are the mayor’s brother.” Lerner said a waiver from the city conflict of interest board would be required, but “even with a waiver, the appointment of the mayor’s close relative does not inspire public confidence”. Bernard Adams’s responsibilities have not been described. Sewell, the new police commissioner, made headlines of her own when she said reforms announced by Alvin Bragg, the city’s new top prosecutor, aiming to decriminalise minor crimes including resisting arrest, raised concerns “about the implications to [the safety of] police officers, the safety of the public and justice for the victims”. “I have strongly recommended to the Manhattan district attorney not to go forward with a policy that treats felony gunpoint robberies of our commercial establishments as misdemeanor shoplifting offenses,” Sewell wrote in a widely leaked letter to police offices. Adams has also vowed to keep New York public schools open for in-person teaching during the Omicron Covid wave and is pushing companies to abandon “remote working” and return workers to office jobs, for the sake of small business. On Wednesday, Adams said “low-skill workers, my cooks, my dishwashers, my messengers, my shoe-shine people, those who work at Dunkin’ Donuts” did not possess “academic skills to sit in a corner office”. That provoked a backlash from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Bronx congresswoman and leading national progressive. “The suggestion that any job is ‘low skill’,” Ocasio-Cortez said, “is a myth perpetuated by wealthy interests to justify inhumane working conditions, little [or] no healthcare, and low wages.” In a statement to the Guardian on Saturday, Ravi Mangla, spokesman for the New York Working Families party, said: “Adams ran as a working-class candidate. And after weeks of cosying up to corporate executives, we’re waiting for him to turn his attention to the everyday people who keep the city running. “What we don’t want is a return to the failed policing models of the past, when communities are asking for real supports and services to get through [the Covid-19] crisis.”",News/US news,New York mayor Eric Adams faces nepotism claim over job for brother,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/09/new-york-mayor-eric-adams-brother-nepotism
1/9/2022,"Friday’s jobs report from the Department of Labor was a warning sign about the US economy. It should cause widespread concern about the Fed’s plans to raise interest rates to control inflation. And it should cause policymakers to rethink ending government supports such as extended unemployment insurance and the child tax credit. These will soon be needed to keep millions of families afloat.  Employers added only 199,000 jobs in December. That’s the fewest new jobs added in any month last year. In November, employers added 249,000. The average for 2021 was 537,000 jobs per month. Note also that the December survey was done in mid-December, before the latest surge in the Omicron variant of Covid caused millions of people to stay home. But the Fed is focused on the fact that average hourly wages climbed 4.7% over the year. Central bankers believe those wage increases have been pushing up prices. They also believe the US is nearing “full employment” – the maximum rate of employment possible without igniting even more inflation. As a result, the Fed is about to prescribe the wrong medicine. It’s going to raise interest rates to slow the economy – even though millions of former workers have yet to return to the job market and even though job growth is slowing sharply. Higher interest rates will cause more job losses. Slowing the economy will make it harder for workers to get real wage increases. And it will put millions of Americans at risk. The Fed has it backwards. Wage increases have not caused prices to rise. Price increases have caused real wages (what wages can actually purchase) to fall. Prices are increasing at the rate of 6.8% annually but wages are growing only between 3-4%. The most important cause of inflation is corporate power to raise prices. Yes, supply bottlenecks have caused the costs of some components and materials to rise. But large corporations have been using these rising costs to justify increasing their own prices when there’s no reason for them to do so. Corporate profits are at a record high. If corporations faced tough competition, they would not pass those wage increases on to customers in the form of higher prices. They’d absorb them and cut their profits. But they don’t have to do this because most industries are now oligopolies composed of a handful of major producers that coordinate price increases. Yes, employers have felt compelled to raise nominal wages to keep and attract workers. But that’s only because employers cannot find and keep workers at the lower nominal wages they’d been offering. They would have no problem finding and retaining workers if they raised wages in real terms – that is, over the rate of inflation they themselves are creating. Astonishingly, some lawmakers and economists continue to worry that the government is contributing to inflation by providing too much help to working people. A few, including some Democrats like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, are unwilling to support Biden’s Build Back Better package because they fear additional government spending will fuel inflation. Here again, the reality is exactly the opposite. The economy is in imminent danger of slowing, as the December job numbers (collected before the Omicron surge) reveal. Many Americans will soon need additional help since they can no longer count on extra unemployment benefits, stimulus payments or additional child tax credits. This is hardly the time to put on the fiscal brakes. Policymakers at the Fed and in Congress continue to disregard the elephant in the room: the power of large corporations to raise prices. As a result, they’re on the way to hurting the people who have been taking it on the chin for decades – average working people.

1/9/2022,"The question I’m 47 years old. Five years ago, I got involved with a married man with two kids. The relationship was intense, hyper-sexual and obsessive. I felt uneasy and tried to end it many times, but was always easily persuaded otherwise by him. He started living separately from his wife two years back and there was terrible heartache with the children going back and forth. I was getting unhappier, more neurotic, and not in control of my see-saw emotions. Then the pandemic brought immense trauma. First, my mother died, swiftly followed by my father and then, in the second wave, my sister-in-law also died of coronavirus. I have become entwined with my brother’s life, helping him resurrect a routine, looking out for his two daughters.  In the midst of all that, I felt I didn’t need to live with what had become a gnawing, unhappy situation with the married man. I tried to explain to him, but I think he’d become so used to me ending it that he thought it’ll be like other times when we would argue and then make up. But I really did finish it this time. I stopped calling him, didn’t respond to his messages. That was three months ago. I feel better for it and am in a more stable space, but feel bad because sometimes I think I have been unfair in ending it like that. Was I hasty? Do I need to meet him and have a rational conversation? Philippa’s answer You have borne a lot of loss and I’m sorry. But I’ll address what you asked me, should you meet your lover again? It seems you were in the habit of ending things with him and then getting back together again. You remind me of a person determined to stop smoking. She knows it’s bad for her, will damage her health, but without ever even putting it into words she finds herself lighting another cigarette; no decision-making process, she just does it. With an addict, there are usually two parts to them: the sensible, this-is-bad-for-me part and the impulsive, unthinking part, who reaches for the cigarette, the drink, the drug or, in your case, the man. You have two parts to you: the part that wants to be with him and the part that doesn’t. I’m going to call them Ms Adventure and Ms Sensible. Ms Adventure makes innocent-sounding suggestions, like, “Maybe we should have a rational conversation,” knowing that if you meet up for some rational conversation, going by past form, you will be seduced all over again. So that is Ms Adventure’s way of tricking Ms Sensible, who knows there’s something not quite right about this suggestion, so she sensibly writes to me. When we are addicted to drink, in our mind we think about what a first or a second drink used to feel like, which fuels the yearning. We don’t think of how we feel in the morning afterwards, we don’t dwell on not being able to stop once we start, we just remember the good bits. And I think there were probably good bits to your affair, loads of great sex, and Ms Adventure will tempt you with these, and she’ll gloss over the gnawing unhappiness and the see-saw emotions. You say you feel more stable without this relationship, but you have come up with an excuse to meet him again, which sounds very much like an addict reaching for those cigarettes. Do you need to contact him again as a question of doing the right, rational thing? No, you don’t. But I’m interested in Ms Adventure, that part of you who is untouched by the sensible, practical part of you and that wants to put you in the position of being in danger of seduction again. Is this for some distraction away from mourning those you have lost and how you feel for your brother and your nieces? Some intense, hyper-sexual passion would be a welcome distraction. What I think is, you know you feel better without him, but you have not admitted that you cannot resist him. If you meet him again you won’t have ended it, the meeting will be a continuation of it. What are you going to do with that part of you that longs for passion and intensity, but never quite puts that into words? You cannot ignore her, or she’ll do something that wouldn’t be in the best interest for both parts of you. You’d better find out a bit more about her; you don’t want her sabotaging the sensible part of you. The rational conversation that needs to be had is between Ms Sensible and Ms Adventure. What would they say to each other? I think you might always be in a see-saw of emotion unless you give Ms Adventure a voice and allow Ms Sensible to compromise. They may conclude that you need to take up painting, or try internet dating, and that you are giving support to your brother, but not getting any yourself. I’d recommend joining a grief group or otherwise finding support (cruse.org.uk). Do something for you, but without falling back down a hole you’ve just managed to climb out of.

1/9/2022," Conservative MPs and rightwing commentators have misrepresented the jury’s verdict in the trial of the four protesters who toppled the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in order to fan the flames of a divisive culture war, one of the defendants has told the Observer.  Rhian Graham said the jury had accepted the argument put forward by the protesters’ lawyers – that they had a lawful excuse to remove the statue because continued veneration of a slave trader responsible for the brutal transportation of thousands of enslaved African people in the centre of Bristol amounted to a hate crime. “None of us denied toppling the statue. But we definitely did not admit to criminal damage. We all believed what we did was right and necessary – and the jury listened for 10 days and found we acted lawfully,” she said in a pub garden in the city. “The verdict does not give people the right to go around smashing things up willy-nilly.” Graham, 30, and Jake Skuse, 33, Milo Ponsford, 26, and Sage Willoughby, 22, were cleared of criminal damage last week for their role in pulling down the Colston statue during a Black Lives Matter protest in Bristol in June 2020. However, the attorney general, Suella Braverman, said on Friday she was considering referring the case to the court of appeal to clarify the law as the verdict was “causing confusion”. The acquittals cannot be overturned and there cannot be a retrial without fresh evidence, but judges could be asked to clarify points of law. This came after a backlash from Tory MPs, who claimed the verdict was “perverse” and “a vandal’s charter” that “allows anyone to rip down statues, vandalise public art and memorials or desecrate buildings”. John Hayes MP, who wrote to Braverman on behalf of the “anti-woke” Common Sense Group of Tory MPs, claimed the jury was devoid of an understanding of criminal damage because if “you damage, destroy or deface property without permission, you are guilty by definition”. The Daily Mail columnist Richard Littlejohn asserted the four cleared protesters had made no attempt to deny they had been caught on camera “committing criminal damage”. However, legal experts have pointed out the law does allow property to be damaged if there is “a lawful excuse”. The Colston verdict follows similar cases where juries have found environmental and anti-war campaigners were justified in damaging property to prevent greater crimes. Graham – who brought rope to the demonstration and helped the crowd drag the statue from its pedestal – said misleading comments by some MPs were preventing vital conversations about the country’s history. “These tactics are really damaging to unity because people hang on to these taglines and buzzwords rather than delving into the nuances of each situation,” said Graham, who works in the events industry. “I keep hearing that this case is a green light for pulling down statues. But it’s not – it’s about this statue, in this city, in this time.” The group’s impassioned, tearful remarks on the steps of Bristol crown court after they were exonerated were derided as “woke platitudes” by the Daily Mail. Other papers referred to the four cleared protesters as “vandals” and “woke statue-topplers” in the days that followed. “The war on woke is a feeble attempt to find another scapegoat – a sort of mythical enemy to blame everything on,” said Graham. “Woke is actually a colloquial term for being aware of social injustice – it’s been appropriated by the right as a way to demonise young people who care about equality and making the world a better place.” While Graham has become the unofficial spokesperson for the Colston Four, she has been careful to closely guard her privacy, partly out of fears about “being targeted” by “malicious people” enraged by the culture war stoked by Tory MPs. But last week a reporter working for the Sun turned up at the place where she is living, which is different to the postal address given in court. “I’ve intentionally kept where I live out of the news – so where did they get that information? It made me feel intimidated,” she said. Her father also had to fend off unwanted approaches. “Someone turned up at my dad’s house in Norfolk,” she said. “It’s not nice to know someone is snooping around.” The felling of Colston by a crowd of black and white protesters 18 months ago has forced Bristol to examine its pivotal role in the transatlantic slave trade. Colston’s name has been removed from two schools, a university building, a concert hall and a pub in the city. A stained-glass window dedicated to Colston has also been taken down. But the eventual fate of the statue is still unclear. It was put back into storage last week after being displayed for more than seven months in a Bristol museum, where thousands came to see the graffiti-sprayed monument laying on its side, without its notorious plaque celebrating “one of the most virtuous and wise sons of the city”. The commission set up by the city’s mayor, Marvin Rees, after the toppling, is due to make detailed recommendations next month about the future of the statue and the empty plinth from which Colston once surveyed the city centre. Prof Tim Cole, the commission’s chair, said there had been 14,000 responses to a consultation on the statue. “I’ve spent the last week reading through millions of words. We were really surprised by the level of engagement: this is a subject people in the city really care about,” he said. “We are almost there with some very specific recommendations about the future of the statue and plinth.” Cole said the verdict last week was now part of the statue’s history. “It is put up in the late 19th century, it’s taken down in the early 21st century. And four of those who took it down are put on trial and found not guilty by a jury in the city,” he said. “They are very much part of the story of the statue. It is a historic moment.”",News/World news,Colston protester says Tories are misusing their acquittals to fan flames of culture war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/09/colston-protester-says-tories-are-misusing-their-acquittals-to-fan-flames-of-culture-war
1/9/2022,"A 14-year-old girl remains missing as parts of Queensland continue to be affected by major flooding. The aftermath of ex-tropical cyclone Seth has caused “unexpected” heavy rains and storms across parts of the state, with further cyclone activity expected this week.  Severe thunderstorms were no longer occurring across Capricornia, Wide Bay and Burnett but a tropical cyclone may be brewing further north in the wake of Seth, with a tropical low developing east of Cape York Peninsula. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the cyclone was forecast to hit the coast as a category one system at about 4am on Monday, local time. Sustained winds near the centre of up to 55km/h were being detected, with wind gusts of up to 85km/h over the north-western Coral Sea as the low slowly moved towards far north Queensland. The Bureau of Meteorology said the low was expected to intensify into a tropical cyclone by Monday morning before making landfall between Cooktown and Lockhart River. Winds of up to 110km/h are possible as far north as Cape Grenville or as far south as Cape Tribulation – if there were slight changes in the track to north or south. Bureau of Meteorology senior meteorologist Dean Narramore said the cyclone would lead to heavy rainfall that might develop to flash and riverine flooding. “After weakening over land, it will continue moving west into the Gulf of Carpentaria, bringing heavy rain and damaging winds and redeveloping into a cyclone on Tuesday as it moves towards the Northern Territory,” he said. Palaszczuk said all agencies were “well prepared” for the cyclone, which will be named Tropical Cyclone Tiffany. “To all of the residents in those areas – please be on the lookout. We’ll be keeping a very close eye on that,” the premier said. A tropical low is developing east of Cape York Peninsula.

No one else was in the car at the time. Queensland fire and emergency services have responded to 42 swift water rescue jobs, with people trapped by flood waters throughout Imbil, Gayndah and Woolooga. The SES has responded to more than 155 requests for assistance across the region, including nine boat rescues. Additional crews have been deployed from Brisbane and central Queensland as flood water continues to move through the area. A 40-year-old man was rescued after a car was swept away in the early hours of Saturday morning at Booubyjan, near Gympie in Queensland’s south-east. It’s believed he and a 14-year-old girl managed to get out of the car before it was swept away in flood waters near the Burnett Highway and Murgon Gayndah Road. Police said the man was found clinging to a tree but the girl remains missing. The state disaster coordinator, Brendan Moon, said ongoing road closures had impeded the search for the missing teenager. He said there had been a “high intensity” operational response from Bundaberg to Kilcoy over the weekend, with 16 tasks that required air support and 11 people transported by air. All were in a stable condition but there remained “grave fears” for the teenage girl. “This is a very, very difficult environment,” Moon said. “We are unable to get in there and conduct the search appropriately at the moment. It’s going to take some time for us to do that.” Palaszczuk said her thoughts were with the family of the girl.

The river was sitting just above nine metres on Sunday morning. There had been 177 requests for assistance in the Maryborough area in relation to people at risk. No people were currently unaccounted for, but some 80 homes were expected to be impacted by the floods. The Mary River at Gympie was at 13 metres and rising, expected to peak about 14 metres on Sunday morning and remain above the moderate flood level into the afternoon. Flooding and strong rises were also being observed in the Tinana Creek catchment, with moderate flooding at Tagigan Road. The prolonged flooding had caused highways to close and cut off some towns as searches continued for missing residents. The Mary River is steadily rising at Maryborough. Sitting at around 9.01m (major flood level 9m).

The areas of Kilkivan and Theebine copped a torrential drenching that we probably haven’t seen before.” The main water pipeline in Gympie was fractured due to road corrosion. “There will be massive amounts of damage to road infrastructure and bridges,” Hartwig said. “We’ll be stuck into that as the water subsides.” We often talk about the dangers lurking in flood waters, well here is the proof!A small bull shark has been spotted in flood water at Queens Park, Maryborough.With children on school holidays it is a timely reminder of how dangerous flood waters can be.📸 Judi Ellis pic.twitter.com/WiCqGwHzRB Narramore said the threat of heavy rainfall had eased and flood-affected areas should remain mostly dry in the coming days.
