2/6/2022,"Scott Morrison has declared politics is a “brutal business” as he seeks to downplay the leaking of a text message from the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, branding him a “hypocrite and a liar”. Speaking at the i4Give Day memorial service in Sydney, which commemorates the young victims killed in the Oatlands crash in 2020, the prime minister also spoke of his Christian faith, saying he had “easily” forgiven Joyce for the damaging text message leaked on Friday.  “Politics is a brutal business,” Morrison said on Sunday. “If you can’t accept and understand each other’s frailties, and be forgiving in those circumstances, then frankly, that says a lot more about you than it does about others. “That is what my faith has always informed me to do … as it has so many others, and I’m thankful for that. “Politicians, they’re no different to anyone else. And people say things, and people feel things, people get angry, people get bitter. Of course they do. That’s all of us. And so who am I to be judging someone else?” Morrison said “no one is immune” to having unpleasant things said about them, but the more important question was how to respond. He said he hoped the lesson from the i4Give day of “understanding human frailty” was heeded. “Human frailty, it’s real. We all share it. We all live with it. And we all need to be more understanding of it.” He insisted that he and Joyce could continue to work together, saying he would not be distracted by last week’s leaked messages, which came after revelations of another text exchange between the former New South Wakes premier Gladys Berejiklian and an unnamed Liberal minister, in which Morrison was called a “horrible, horrible person”, a “complete psycho”. He insisted that none of the leaks had come from within his cabinet. “What people send around in texts I frankly could not care less about,” he said. “Australians are far more interested in their jobs and their lives than what people are sending in text messages to each other,” he said. Senior ministers also rallied around Morrison on Sunday ahead of the parliamentary sitting week, dismissing the series of text messages that questioned his trustworthiness. The environment minister Sussan Ley said that while it had been a difficult week for the government, she insisted the chance of any leadership spill against Morrison or Joyce was “absolutely none”. “The most important issue is the unity in the Morrison government,” Ley told Sky News on Sunday.“As a minister that has sat in three cabinets with three prime ministers … this is the most united cabinet table I have sat at.” When questioned on whether Morrison remained an asset for the Liberal party, the home affairs minister Karen Andrews said the prime minister was a “great campaigner” who had connected well with voters at the 2019 election, when he defied expectations of a Labor victory. “It is a different set of circumstances now, but the Scott Morrison that was there a couple of years ago back in 2019 is the same Scott Morrison that we have now,” Andrews told the ABC’s Insiders program. “We need to get him out into the community, out in Victoria, Queensland, New South Wales, all of the states across Australia. We all need to be doing that. It has been an incredibly difficult time for everyone and we all have to make sure that we are properly connecting.” When asked if she had ever known Morrison to tell a lie, Andrews said that had not been her experience, and he had only ever been “decent and respectful”. “I’ve had a couple of robust discussions with him, as you would expect, but I’ve always found him to be respectful to me, to listen to what I had to say. “He doesn’t always agree with it, but we just work our way through it.” Andrews also said that she was confident that Joyce and Morrison would be able to work together cooperatively “in the national interest”, despite the damaging leak of the message sent by Joyce as a backbencher in 2019. In the message, which was sent to a third party to be conveyed to former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins, Joyce said he did not “get along” with Morrison. “He is a hypocrite and a liar from my observations and that is over a long time,” Joyce said in the screenshot of a message, dated 22 March last year. “I have never trusted him, and I dislike how earnestly [he] rearranges the truth to a lie.” Joyce disavowed the message on Saturday, saying it had not been based on his recent relationship with Morrison, with whom he has been in parliament since 2007, and worked with in cabinet for close to a decade. “My view from the backbench about the prime minister was based on assumption and commentary, not from a one on one working relationship,” Joyce said. “From a one on one working relationship, I found a man who has honoured every agreement that he’s made with me.” On Friday, Morrison accepted an apology from Joyce, and knocked back the offer of his resignation. “I understand Barnaby was in a different headspace last year, both professionally and personally, and so I know he genuinely no longer feels this way. Relationships change over time. Politicians are humans beings too. We all have our frailties and none of us are perfect.” The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, seized on the divisions, labelling the government “a smoking ruin of division and disunity and dysfunction”. “The government seems to spend all of its time dishing out free character assessments of each other.”",News/Australia news,‘Politics is a brutal business’: Morrison says he forgives Joyce for leaked text message,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/06/politics-is-a-brutal-business-morrison-says-he-forgives-joyce-for-leaked-text-message
2/6/2022,"On the 182nd anniversary of the signing of Aotearoa New Zealand’s founding document, the Waitangi Treaty grounds – usually thronging with tens of thousands of people – were quiet and cloaked in a gloss of rain, a sign, or tohu, to some that it is a Waitangi Day like no other. National events were cancelled this year, and ceremonies, speeches and reflections moved online, as the country teeters on the edge of a widespread Omicron outbreak.  In previous years, the day begins with a dawn service, where Māori leaders, members of parliament, religious leaders, officials and countless others gather in darkness to join together in waiata (song) and prayer. Then follow speeches, live music, and a barbecue served up by the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, and members of her Labour party. Roughly 40,000 people attend the celebration each year, under a blazing summer sun. Today, under drizzly, subdued, skies, just 200 people gathered on the shoreline below Ti Tii Marae, to watch waka taua – war canoes – paddle to the shore. Pita Tipene, chairman of the Waitangi National Trust Board, said the morning was surreal without the usual crowds. Tipene held his own karakia (prayer) early in the morning, with his mokopuna (grandchildren). He stood at the marae (meeting house) and looked across the empty grounds, where he would usually see people standing shoulder-to-shoulder, and likened it to a forest without birdsong or cicadas. “The interaction, and the discourse, and discussion and debate and the buzz of the people – it is very similar to being in a forest with the bird song – [without it] something’s not quite right. In this case, it’s Covid being amongst us all, and the decision that was made to ensure the safety and welfare of everybody.” Tipene commented on the rain falling across much of the North Island, and said that in his memory, he has never attended a Waitangi Day where it had poured down. “That in itself is a tohu, a sign,” he said, adding that he sees the rain on Waitangi, which translates to “weeping water”, as a positive sign for reflection and change. “It’s time to set this nation on the course that was envisioned by our tupuna [ancestors], when they signed it 182 years ago.” That includes looking towards the treaty’s bicentennial in 18 years. “I’m encouraging all leaders, including political leaders, to start having, in a very purposeful way, conversations about what nationhood means and what are some tangible symbols could be brought to Waitangi and other parts of the country for 2040.” In a pre-recorded address, Ardern said while people cannot come together on the treaty grounds, “the day remains of great importance to us as a nation”. “In previous speeches you have heard me use the metaphor that ‘Aotearoa will always have clouds’, to represent the challenges we need to overcome today and into the future. “How we need to continue to use every opportunity to cross the bridge, te arawhiti, and join our two worlds. And how we need to work in partnership to improve outcomes for Māori, and for all New Zealanders. “While we always have more work to do – the mahi never ends – it is important to take time and reflect.” Ardern reflected on some of the year’s milestones – New Zealand’s pandemic response, which led to some of the best health outcomes in the world; a new school curriculum that will include the teaching of New Zealand history; and 2022 becoming the first year where Matariki, the Māori new year celebration, will be honoured as a public holiday. But she acknowledged the government still had a way to go in turning around poverty, housing inequality and poor health outcomes for Māori. “If we are to make progress as a nation, we have to be willing to question practices that have resulted over and over in the same or even worse outcomes,” Ardern said. “What we all want by and large for our people is the same. The same chance to fulfil our potential. To live decent lives. To make decisions for ourselves. How we get there will differ. That is partnership. That is building the bridge.” The Treaty of Waitangi, Te Tiriti o Waitangi, was signed by Māori chiefs and the British Crown in 1840, and has been commemorated as a public holiday since 1974 – for two years as “New Zealand Day” before reverting to the name of the foundational treaty. It has often been the scene of demonstrations, with Māori protesting against the lack of progress made in tackling inequality and ongoing breaches of the treaty. In Ardern’s first Waitangi Day address in 2018, she urged Māori to continue holding the government to account. Last year the Waitangi Tribunal ruled that the government had breached the treaty by giving little heed to the needs of Māori in its pandemic response. Tipene said the government had not yet been held to account on some matters, but added that it was, compared with many previous governments, more open to conversation and debate. Governor general Dame Cindy Kiro, the first Māori woman to hold the title, used her first Waitangi Day address to acknowledge the many sacrifices New Zealanders had made throughout the pandemic and to thank those who have borne the burden of keeping the country safe. “Covid-19 has again reminded us of the burdens and privileges of citizenship: the duty of care and respect we share as New Zealanders. That was also the message handed down to us by our forefathers who signed Te Tiriti o Waitangi. It is our nation’s great leveller – a moral and social contract that binds us all equally.” Kiro likened the treaty to a “sacred covenant of marriage”. “The vows made at the outset do not end there. Rather, those vows provide the foundation of a lasting commitment. “Throughout our history, we have not always done right by the commitment made by our ancestors 182 years ago. And while we cannot change our past, we can draw wisdom from it. We can see the treaty, not as a burden, but as a gift, because it compels us to consider and respect our differences, and to match virtuous ideals with courageous action.”",News/World news,‘Like a forest without birdsong’: Waitangi Day becomes more reflective as Covid takes toll,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/06/like-a-forest-without-birdsong-waitangi-day-becomes-more-reflective-as-covid-takes-toll
