3/8/2022,"Just one in every 1,000 drivers reported for unnecessary idling of their engines were fined in central London, data has revealed. Toxic air pollution kills about 4,000 people every year in the capital and councils have targeted parked drivers who do not turn off their vehicles. In Westminster, more than 70,000 idling drivers have been reported since 2017 via the council’s “report it” website. But only 63 fines of £80 were issued and just half of these were paid. Westminster council says it has “the worst air pollution in the country” and attracted attention in 2017 when it quadrupled the fine for idling from £20. “Toxic air needs tough action,” said the councillor Andrew Smith at the time. Nickie Aiken, then the council leader and now MP for Westminster asked the government in 2021 to increase the £80 fine, saying it was not an effective deterrent. The data, released under freedom of information (FoI) rules, lists 99.9% of the idling reports as ending in “soft action”. It does not record whether a driver was asked to switch off their engine and did so, drove off or was not challenged by a council officer. “Westminster Conservatives talk a good talk on air quality but this data shows they did not use the powers at their disposal,” said Max Sullivan, the Labour candidate for the Bayswater council ward who made the FoI request. “The lack of tough action on engine idling is appalling and will be disappointing news to those worried about air pollution.” In Bayswater, just two fines were issued over five years and neither were paid, he said. Lambeth council issued three times more idling fines than Westminster from 2019-21. “It is reasonable to have some soft enforcement,” Sullivan said. “The problem is there is virtually no hard action at all. I don’t know what you’d have to do to get fined.” The data was likely to represent just a fraction of the true scale of the problem, he said. Air pollution may be damaging every organ in the human body, according to a comprehensive 2019 review, and is particularly damaging to children. A recent study found that switching off an engine for even 30 seconds cuts pollution by half compared with idling. “Tackling air quality is a major priority for my constituents – and therefore me,” Aiken said. “From my experience, when I introduced the ‘don’t be idle’ campaign as council leader, the vast majority of drivers who are asked to turn off their engines do so. Perhaps that is why we have very few fines given out. For those who refuse, £80 doesn’t seem to cease their behaviour. Perhaps a larger fine will focus their minds.” James Spencer, a Westminster council cabinet member for city management, said: “The council has run a successful anti-engine idling campaign for several years. The campaign’s main purpose is to educate and change behaviour, however, we do issue fines to the worst and repeat offenders. “The impact of poor air quality on health should not be underestimated, especially for children. That’s why we also work closely with schools to distribute anti-idling posters and leaflets.” Gary Fuller, an air pollution expert at Imperial College London, said: “Many councils boast to me about their anti-idling work. This effort seems out of proportion to the knowledge base. Most evidence is more than a decade old, with little evidence on the emissions from modern vehicles with the latest exhaust technologies. “I’m not saying that idling is OK – far from it. But I worry that it becomes a politically acceptable diversion that reduces the pressure to take action on the far greater air pollution from the vehicles that are moving.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, proposed on Friday that the capital’s ultra-low emission zone be extended to the whole of Greater London by the end of 2023. This would mean drivers of all but the newest diesel vehicles, and some older petrol vehicles, would have to pay £15.50 each day for cars, and more for larger vehicles. The extension is projected to cut the number of the most polluting cars on London’s roads by 20,000-40,000 a day.",News/Environment,"Just 0.1% of idling drivers fined in central London, data reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/08/idling-drivers-fined-central-london-toxic-air-pollution
3/8/2022,"Good morning. Moscow has stoked fears of an energy war by threatening to close a major gas pipeline to Germany after the US pushed its European allies to consider banning Russian oil imports over its invasion of Ukraine. In an address on Russian state television, Russia’s deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, said: “A rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market,” and claimed the price of oil could rise to more than US$300 a barrel. Buses have begun leaving two devastated Ukrainian cities, Sumy and Irpin, in a fresh attempt to evacuate civilians, as the number of people fleeing the country from Russia’s onslaught passed 2 million and the WHO warned Ukraine was running out of vital medical supplies. There was no certainty, however, over how long the evacuations would last. Previous efforts were abandoned after Russian forces continued to bombard residential areas and civilians trying to take the routes to safety themselves came under fire. What has Joe Biden said about Russian oil imports? The president held a video conference call with the leaders of France, Germany and Britain yesterday as he pushed for their support to ban Russian oil imports. The US was, however, willing to move ahead without its European allies, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 13 of the Russian invasion. About 66,000 Ukrainians have returned home to help from around the world. Here’s one man’s story about his journey from Portland to Ukraine’s frontlines. A man accused of attempting to join hijackers in carrying out the September 11 attacks has been repatriated to his home country of Saudi Arabia for mental health treatment after two decades detained at Guantánamo Bay, the US Department of Defense said yesterday. Mohammad Ahmad al-Qahtani was flown back to Saudi Arabia, to a treatment facility, from the US base in Cuba after a review board including military and intelligence officials concluded he no longer represented a significant threat to US national security, and could be safely released after 20 years in custody. The 46-year-old prisoner has suffered from mental illness, including schizophrenia, since childhood, according to medical examinations and records obtained by his lawyers. What was his involvement in 9/11? According to a Guantánamo detainee profile maintained by the Defense Department, al-Qahtani was trained by al-Qaida and sought unsuccessfully to enter the US on 4 August 2001 to take part in the 9/11 attacks. Was he tortured? The man was subjected to brutal interrogations that the Pentagon legal official in charge of war crimes commissions said amounted to torture, including beatings, exposure to extreme temperatures and noise, sleep deprivation and extended solitary confinement. The US supreme court has rejected requests from Republicans in North Carolina and Pennsylvania to overturn electoral maps imposed by the state supreme court in both places that make elections more competitive. The justices ruled 6-3 on Monday not to block the new North Carolina maps from going into effect, with justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas saying they would have paused the state supreme court’s ruling. In the Pennsylvania case, there were no noted dissents from the court’s decision. That case will now go to a panel of three federal judges and Republicans can appeal a ruling from whatever they decide to the US supreme court in the future. Both decisions are a win for Democrats politically, as well as voting rights groups that have turned to state supreme courts recently to try to police partisan gerrymandering. The US supreme court said in 2019 that federal courts could not police partisan gerrymandering, but said state constitutions could. Why did Republicans say they wanted the US supreme court to block that map? They argued that the US constitution explicitly gives state legislatures the power to set the “time, manner, and place of elections”. By drawing new districts, they argued, the state supreme court has overstepped its authority. There were emotional scenes on day four of the Winter Paralympics in Beijing as Ukrainian athletes completed two podium sweeps at the National Biathlon Centre in Zhangjiakou. Tony Estanguet, the president of the Paris 2024 Olympic organising committee for the Olympics, said the Ukrainian athletes were competing in “extremely difficult conditions, but […] will be keen to defend the colours of their country”. The juror in Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial who apparently did not disclose childhood sexual abuse during jury selection is scheduled to appear in court today for public questioning. Juror no 50, whose name is Scotty David, may receive immunity, which would require that he answer questions. World No 3 Alexander Zverev has been handed a suspended eight-week ban from ATP-sanctioned events after an investigation into his conduct at the Mexican Open last month. The German repeatedly hit the chair of umpire Alessandro Germani with his racket at the end of a doubles match. One person was killed and two others were critically wounded in a shooting outside an Iowa school, authorities said yesterday. Des Moines police said in a news release that gunfire that struck the victims on the grounds of East High School, near Des Moines’ downtown, appeared to come from a passing vehicle. More than 170 million Americans who were adults in 2015 were exposed to harmful levels of lead as children, a new study estimates. In a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday, they estimated that half the US adult population in 2015 had been exposed to lead levels surpassing five micrograms per deciliter – the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention threshold for harmful lead exposure at the time. “If I followed me on Instagram, I would mute myself so quickly,” writes Shelby Lorman for Please Clap. “My posts were normal enough: mutual aid links, articles about the latest science from people I trusted, memes made by disabled friends about what it was like to be sick. But then I’d add selfies, below which I’d write paragraphs processing what it was like to watch others make different decisions than me during Covid. ‘I’m not going to look at some of you the same way again,’ one of my most memorable posts said.” Our nation’s public school system has long been mired in a substitute teacher shortage, which has only intensified during the pandemic. Long frustrated by low wages, substitutes – as well as other support staff workers – have been driven out of the profession, whether because of safety concerns, lack of childcare options or due to vaccine and mask mandates they believe to be government overreach. Joshua Needelman explains what it was like as a “a glorified babysitter” during the pandemic. The Amazon is approaching a tipping point, data shows, after which the rainforest would be lost with “profound” implications for the global climate and biodiversity. Computer models have previously indicated a mass dieback of the Amazon is possible but the new analysis is based on real-world satellite observations over the past three decades. Novel statistical analysis shows that more than 75% of the untouched forest has lost stability since the early 2000s, meaning it takes longer to recover after droughts and wildfires. Locklan Samples of Georgia has a rare condition that means his hair stands out from the scalp and cannot be combed flat.

3/8/2022,"The former Commons Speaker John Bercow has been banned from holding a House of Commons pass as an ex-MP after a bullying inquiry into his treatment of three staff members. Bercow was found to have bullied staff members by Kathryn Stone, the standards commissioner, and her verdict was on Tuesday upheld by an independent expert panel. The report upheld 21 out of 35 claims against him made by former staff relating to behaviour during his decade as Speaker. As Speaker, Bercow made a number of high-profile stands against the government’s use of Brexit legislation, allowing a number of unorthodox challenges by MPs. But his final years in the role were dogged by allegations of bullying, including swearing at officials and throwing his mobile phone. The allegations were brought by Lord Lisvane, the former clerk of the Commons, and private secretaries Kate Emms and Angus Sinclair. Bercow, a former Conservative MP, who has since defected to Labour was previously denied a peerage despite being nominated by the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Bercow released a statement on the findings, calling the investigation “amateurish” and claiming the complainants had been resisting his attempts to modernise parliament. The former Speaker said: “Parliament is supposed to be the highest court in the land. This inquiry, which lasted a ghastly 22 months at great cost to the taxpayer, has failed it dismally. At the end of it, the panel has simply said that I should be denied a parliamentary pass which I have never applied for and do not want. That is the absurdity of its position.” Bercow will be banned from getting a pass as a former MP but would still be able to go into the Palace of Westminster as a guest or member of the public.",News/Politics,John Bercow banned from holding Commons pass after bullying inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/08/john-bercow-ex-speaker-banned-commons-bullying-inquiry
3/8/2022,"In January when Netflix announced it would be raising its US and Canadian subscription prices, Jennifer Hamra had a question: “Are the streaming prices going to be equivalent to my cable prices?” For many streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, HBO and Apple had meant an end to costly cable deals. A new generation of “cable cutters” eagerly dropped their cable packages and reached for a cheaper alternative that also offered greater flexibility and choice. Now many are wondering if those days are over. Netflix raised the price of its most popular plan, the middle of three subscription tiers, from $14 to $15.50 a month. Wall Street responded favorably to the news and Netflix’s stock price rose 3%. The streaming company has a US and Canada subscriber base of about 75m, with a total of about 222m subscribers worldwide. More money from subscribers, even just an extra $1.50 per account, would bring an extra flood of cash to the company. But some Netflix subscribers found the news unsettling. The company had last increased its price in October 2020, raising the price of its most popular subscription plan from $13 to $14. “I don’t recall them increasing the price so frequently,” said JHamra of Detroit, Michigan, a mother of six and Netflix subscriber for 15 years. “Now I’m concerned.” Hamra said that she cancelled her cable subscription in January of last year as her family sought to cut back on bills. Cord cutting has saved her $100 a month, but the cost of subscribing to three streaming services – Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video – is starting to rack up. “It’s starting to feel like it’s defeating the purpose of getting rid of cable,” Hamra said. In surveys, cord cutters have indicated they felt like subscribing to streaming services over cable got them a better deal. But the cost of streaming is rising: Subscribing to the standard plans of Disney+, Hulu, Netflix and HBO Max can cost over $50 – about the same price as some basic cable plans. Analysts who are closely watching the streaming wars say that subscribers should get comfortable with price increases as streaming services start changing their business models. Netflix’s recent price increase is a signal that it will turn to existing subscribers to help grow revenue, rather than clambering to get new subscribers. Netflix is already the most popular streaming service, and its subscriber growth is slowing. The company’s recent price increase made it replace HBO Max, which is $15 a month, as the most expensive streaming service. Cost-savvy Netflix subscribers may be tempted to turn to cheaper streaming services like Peacock or Paramount+, whose most expensive plans cost $10 a month, but analysts say the prices subscribers see now are likely to only increase over time. For now, those newer streaming services are offering consumers a bit of a deal as they try to grow their subscriber base. Take Disney+, which launched in 2019 and currently costs $7 a month, or $14 for a Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle. Along with Disney classics and Marvel films, the streaming platform has debuted exclusive content like the Mandalorian and Peter Jackson’s Beatle documentary Get Back. The platform now has 130m subscribers, and the company is aiming to get to at least 230m subscribers by 2024. “They chose to price low so they could grab subscribers quickly and make the barrier to trying it very low,” said Berna Barshay, an analyst with Empire Financial Research. “That’s worked for them. I wouldn’t expect to see Disney+ stay a sub-$10 service forever.” Barshay said all the streaming services have shown they are willing to absorb some losses to get on new subscribers – Netflix took on debt as it was building its streaming library and making original content – but ultimately, the streaming wars will not last. Last year, a poll found that the number of streaming services people subscribe to increased from 3.9 to 4.5, but Barshay and other analysts expect that most people will subscribe to a maximum of four services. “Right now, everybody’s jockeying for a position,” Barshay said. “As these markets mature, the growth is going to have to come from not so much adding new customers, but from retaining the customers you already have and putting price increases on them.” Streaming companies know that even if the price of streaming goes up, consumers are unlikely to go back to cable anytime soon. The number of Americans with cable has been plummeting – major TV events like the Superbowl and the Oscars have been seeing their lowest ratings ever – not only because consumers say they are saving by cord cutting, but because streaming has changed the way Americans watch shows and movies. Viewers are no longer used to watching advertisements that take up 15 minutes of programming in each hour. Plus streaming allows TV viewers to watch shows on their own time and on-the-go. The slow death of cable has mostly been a tragedy for media companies who once reaped huge profits from both cable subscribers and advertisers. It is estimated that the continued decline of cable subscriptions will bring a $25bn drop in revenue, excluding advertising revenue, for major cable networks like Disney, Fox and NBCUniversal. These same companies have been pivoting to streaming over the last few years. “They basically created a monster that grew too big for them to kill,” Barshay said. “You look to Gen Z and you have a whole generation that doesn’t even know how to use a cable remote. These aren’t cord-cutters, they’re cord-nevers.” Hamra said that she is unlikely to cancel any of her streaming services this year but will consider cutting one if the cost of streaming continues to increase. But even with the higher costs, she said her family will never go back to cable. “I don’t like the commercials. I don’t like having to wait for the next episode. I like that I can binge-watch, and I can watch on my own time,” Hamra said. “With the streaming services, it allows me that flexibility.” Plus, even if she cancelled one of her existing subscriptions, Hamra said she would still feel like she has a plethora of options. “It reminds me of the library where there’s no way you’re going to be able to read every single book,” she said. “There’s no way I’m going to be able to watch every single show.”",News/Media,‘Cable cutters’ wonder whether cheaper alternative is over as Netflix raises price,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/08/cable-cutters-netflix-raises-price-streaming-cheaper-alternative
3/8/2022,"On Sunday, I had heard that there would be a flashmob orchestra in Trafalgar Square, playing Mussorgsky’s Great Gate of Kiev, in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. I went along with two 12-year-olds and made all the promises you have to make to get two preteens to go anywhere with you (it won’t take long and it’s near an Itsu). Instead, we found a modest Stop the War rally with not a viola in sight – just Jeremy Corbyn speaking from a makeshift stage. “He just said: ‘War is bad because it kills people,’” my kid summarised – then, witheringly: “And this is your icon?” I explained that you don’t go to a demo for an original hypothesis. This was my entire childhood, standing in a crowd, listening to why war is bad, and so is poll tax. Also, “icon” is way too strong a word for my feelings about Corbyn, although I am glad to see him back in his happy place, saying determined, uncomplicated things to a small crowd. There were some homemade signs, but two banners centrally produced, one uncontroversial: “No to Nuclear War.” The other was more problematic, drawing an elliptical but discernible equivalence between Putin’s aggression and Nato’s “expansion”, by saying “no” to both. This was quite complicated. They say you only discover how well you understand something when you try to explain it to someone else; when the someone else is a scathing preteen, you discover it faster. I can lay out the criticism of Stop the War easily enough – that its anti-Americanism is so vehement, it amounts to pro-almost-anything-else, from Assad to Putin. What I couldn’t do was explain what that meant for pacifism generally. Had the entire case against war been hollowed out? Is everyone who has ever been on a Stop the War rally discredited? Realistically, given the strength of popular opposition to the Iraq war, isn’t that almost all of us? Would I get kicked out of the Labour party for being in Trafalgar Square at all? Well no, obviously: I was looking for Mussorgsky, on my way to an Itsu.

3/8/2022,"Proclaiming what’s going to happen is a popular way to shrug off taking responsibility for helping to determine what’s going to happen. And it’s something we’ve seen a lot with doomspreading prophecies that Donald Trump is going to run for president or even win in 2024. One of the assumptions is that Trump will still be alive and competent to run, but the health of this sedentary shouter in his mid-70s, including the after-effects of the Covid-19 he was hospitalised for in 2020, could change. Look to external issues too, for whatever the condition of his own health, his financial health is under attack, with businesses losing money and some banks refusing to lend to him after the storming of the Capitol. It’s also worth remembering that he lost the popular vote by millions in 2016 and by more millions in 2020; he never had a mandate. The Republicans are clearly gearing up to try to steal an election again, but their chances of winning one with Trump as candidate seem slim. Currently, he is creating conflict within the Republican party with his insistence on controlling it for his own agenda and punishing dissenters. Another assumption we make when we assess Trump’s prospects is that he won’t be locked up in 2024, or that his reputation, such as it is, won’t be severely damaged even in the eyes of some who voted for him before. Even in the past couple of weeks his standing has shifted significantly. Former attorney general Bill Barr is now speaking up – to promote his book – about how Trump was clearly advised that his claims of election theft had no basis and that his strategies to overturn the results were illegal. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has woken up people around the world (or at least those who were dozing) to Vladimir Putin’s malevolence and reminded Americans of how eagerly Trump allied himself with the Russian dictator, personally and politically. Suddenly a lot of Republicans are trying to scurry away from their own pro-Putin record, which may mean distancing themselves from Trump as well. His 2019 withholding of military aid to Ukraine to try to pressure Ukrainian president Zelenskiy into supporting his lies is also being re-examined under the harsh light of this war. Additionally, Trump is facing many criminal charges, from allegations of financial dirty dealing by the Trump Organization in New York (Trump has called the various probes into the business “politically motivated”), to an investigation into whether Trump and his allies subverted election results in Georgia, where Trump claims election fraud took place. Just last week, the January 6 committee laid out a series of potential charges against the ex-president, including conspiracy to defraud the American people and obstructing an official proceeding of Congress. Trump’s domestic status seems to be shifting rapidly. He is also facing so many lawsuits that both CNN and NBC published indexes of the cases. Last month news broke that Trump had left the White House with classified documents, which he claimed he had a right to take to his home. That could be a felony, though how much appetite the Biden administration has for jailing a former president remains to be seen. Among the large array of civil charges Trump faces are E Jean Carroll’s allegations of defamation over his insult-laden denial that he raped her (he has responded that he was simply responding in the line of “official duties”) and former consigliere Michael Cohen’s case that his return to prison was triggered by Trump after Cohen released a revealing memoir. There are also suits holding Trump responsible for the January 6 insurrection both from members of Congress, and two policemen injured in the mayhem. In February the courts ruled that these civil suits can go forward, and Trump lacks the immunity that would protect him from them. Trump has initiated lawsuits of his own, but a great many have been dismissed, although he is still suing his niece, Mary Trump, for disclosing tax information about him. She in turn is suing him and two of his siblings, alleging that they defrauded her out of much of her inheritance (which they deny). Though the 14th amendment of the US constitution should ban all insurrectionists from running for elected office, it seems unlikely to be applied to 21st-century candidates the way it was to former Confederates. But still, the Georgia and New York charges are serious. All of which is to say that the road from early 2022 to late 2024 is bumpy for Trump. Popular opinion is fickle; George W Bush is Trump’s age and clearly a permanent has-been. Even Barack Obama, at 60, has strolled offstage. But even if Trump is not indisputably in the running, Trumpism is running rampant, and it’s a force to contend with in political races across the US. Trump was a super-spreader of his brand of amoral self-interest that tramples fact, truth, law and rights. The man himself is sulking in his private club in Florida – enduring effectual exile from New York, Washington – and Twitter – but to a degree, his work is done. He has got an already corrupt political party to embrace his tactics and values. The brazen lies of prominent figures in the party show that they’ve abandoned all ethics and standards, and will happily violate the oaths they took to uphold the constitution. Viral Trumpism has already merged with conspiracy theories such as QAnon, with anti-vaccine cults, with white supremacists and neo-fascists, and with the gun-fetishising groups that continue to have an ominous presence in public life. I sometimes think of the American right as a pot on the boil; what’s inside is concentrating as it shrinks. The Republican party seems to be losing ground: a Gallup poll from January found that 24% of eligible voters considered themselves Republican, down from 31% in November 2021. That’s a reminder that news stories revealing that a majority of Republicans believe something could actually mean that only a small minority of Americans do. There have been high-profile defections and general atrophy in the age of Trump. That’s the shrinking. But then there’s the concentration that renders those who remain more furious, more closed-minded, more ready to jump on any bandwagon that looks as if it leads to power, and even more rigidly committed to an increasingly rightwing agenda, even though – or maybe because – that means minority rule. For progressives, Republican desperation is a good sign, in its way. A popular party doesn’t have to suppress votes and steal elections. A party aligned with the will of the people doesn’t need to lie and cheat. Trumpism seems like a last gasp, a desperate last chance to hang on to what’s slipping away. The old Soviet-satellite aphorism “You can cut down the flowers but you can’t stop the spring” applies nicely. The future of this country is white-minority. Yet the Republican party has done its best to alienate everybody else, while the rising majority of Americans support reproductive rights, climate action and many economic justice measures. The long-term progressive future of the United States seems almost inevitable. But with Trumpism still a force, the short-term future is alarming and unpredictable, and the damage may be lasting; whether it’s the prevention of climate action or the infliction of literal and financial violence on poor and marginalised people. Enemies of authoritarianism and white supremacy have their work cut out, but the task is clear and straightforward: to protect the democratic process, upholding voting rights and free and fair elections, to try to win those elections for progressive candidates, and to articulate and defend the values behind those objectives. Trump is treading water, but this is how resistance to Trumpism works, and how it can prevail if enough people work at it hard enough. Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

3/8/2022,"Vets and animal advocates in the US are calling for restrictions on “cruel” methods of culling birds, as farmers face killing millions of poultry due to a highly virulent avian flu tearing through the country.In 2020, millions of farm animals were killed across the US after the Covid-19 pandemic shut down slaughterhouses and left animals stranded on farms. Now, bird flu, which has already led to the slaughter of millions of birds in Europe, is likely to result in another mass depopulation.More than 50 million chickens and turkeys were killed after an aggressive bird flu outbreak in the US in 2015.However, two commonly used methods to cull animals on-farm are attracting increasing backlash. The use of firefighting foam to suffocate animals and ventilation shutdown, in which animals are killed with extremely high heat and steam, are still permitted in the US, despite being effectively banned in the EU and labelled “inhumane”.Poultry flocks sickened with avian flu are commonly killed with carbon dioxide poisoning or firefighting foam, where birds are smothered with a blanket of foam.The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) says the method involves “drowning in fluids or suffocation by occlusion of the airways” and is “not accepted as a humane method for killing animals”. It is also not listed as a method of killing animals for disease control by the main animal health body, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Ventilation shutdown, which has been described as “death by heatstroke”, was used to kill potentially millions of pigs during the Covid-19 pandemic. They were packed into sealed barns and killed with extremely high heat and steam.The EFSA lists it among methods that “are likely to be highly painful” and “must never be used”. In the EU, killing animals by suffocation or heat stress would be illegal, although it would be possible to obtain a derogation in an emergency when no suitable alternatives are available, said Peter Sandøe, a professor of bioethics at the University of Copenhagen.In undercover recordings by the animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) of ventilation shutdown taking place, pigs can be heard screaming as they are killed.“I have treated animals with heatstroke and it’s horrible,” said Gwendolen Reyes-Illg, a veterinary adviser to the US-based Animal Welfare Institute. In cases of heatstroke, she explained, “chunks of mucosa and blood come pouring out of the rectum and vomiting of blood is common as well”.Pork producers have maintained that ventilation shutdown was a last-ditch measure necessitated by the pandemic. The American Veterinary Medical Association’s (AVMA) depopulation guidelines says the method should only be used if it can kill 95% or more of animals within an hour. However, Reyes-Illg said that in audio from the DxE investigation, sounds could be heard coming from the pigs after two-and-a-half hours. News stories have described ventilation shutdown as “euthanasia”. But Reyes-lllg said: “It’s kind of Orwellian when you call cooking them alive euthanasia.” Last year, a group of AVMA members submitted a resolution to classify ventilation shutdown as “not recommended”. A decision on the resolution has not been made, but animal welfare experts say it is time for US-wide rules to govern the treatment of farm animals before slaughter. “That is the main difference when it comes to the EU, that we actually have common regulatory standards regarding the welfare of animals on farms, which are not found in the US at the federal level,” said Sandøe, who called the US’s use of ventilation shutdown “a big failure”. Animals are killed on-farm for many reasons, not just disease control, for example due to illness or serious injury. More than 170 million chickens, pigs and cows die or are killed on-farm every year in the US, according to estimates from the National Agricultural Statistics Service. Last month, DxE activists said they discovered a large number of piles of dead pigs discarded outside concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in central Iowa – potentially a result of the spread of an aggressive strain of porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome (PRRS), a deadly virus, in the midwest. In one pile, activists said they found a three-week-old piglet still alive and rushed the animal to a vet, where it tested positive for PRRS. It also had a broken jaw and ribs.It is impossible to know exactly what happened to the piglet, but activists say its injuries suggest it may have been “thumped,” a standard method used to cull sick or otherwise unwanted piglets by slamming them into the floor or ground or hitting them with a hard object such as a pipe. The EFSA lists “disposal of pigs while still alive” as a risk associated with this and other cull methods if not carried out correctly. AVMA guidelines state that “failure to achieve 100% mortality in depopulation is unacceptable”, but reliable statistics on how many animals are thrown away while still alive are hard to come by.Any new US-wide regulations around the killing of farm animals should protect workers too, say activists. According to one study, 10% of surveyed swine veterinarians involved in on-farm culling have thought about suicide and 23% reported needing mental health counselling. In a 2020 video taken by DxE, in which activists spoke to farm workers the day after a ventilation shutdown, one worker simply said: “It’s terrible for everybody.”",News/Environment,‘They’re cooking them alive’: calls to ban ‘cruel’ killing methods on US farms,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/08/theyre-cooking-them-alive-calls-to-ban-cruel-killing-methods-on-us-farms
3/8/2022,"An adviser to the Chinese government has called for new laws to ban “fabricating and disseminating fake information online”, blaming the rampant disinformation on the internet for polarising Chinese public opinion. Jia Qingguo, a member of China’s highest political advisory body, said he also believed the proliferation of misinformation online had fuelled tensions between China and foreign countries. “For example, there are often people online who, for some purpose, package a foreigner’s vicious remarks against China as the view of everyone in that country towards China in order to incite the Chinese people’s dissatisfaction and hostility towards said country and its people,” Jia said in an interview on Saturday with online news portal The Cover, which is affiliated with the state-owned Sichuan Daily. The former dean of the prestigious Peking University’s School of International Studies added that the spread of fake news could harm national interests, and lead to public confusion and social division. He called on Beijing to introduce specific measures to “severely punish” those who create false information to “cause serious harm to society”. Jia said motivations for creating and spreading fake news vary. Some use it to vent their dissatisfaction, others profit through click-baiting, or use it for unfair competition, for example. He pointed out that some netizens spread fake news because of their narrow nationalistic mentality. But while Jia’s proposal appears to be more domestic-focused, observers question any tangible impact of a “fake information law” when China’s internet is already heavily censored and often scrubbed of information Beijing wants to disappear. Some also worry that, if not properly implemented, such a law could have a profound impact on journalistic activities in China by both domestic and foreign news outlets, given Beijing’s track record in press freedom. In the last few years, for example, China has called reports of human rights abuses in Xinjiang “fake news” or “lie of the century”. “China has so many laws and policies restricting freedom of expression that this sort of proposal seems completely superfluous,” William Nee, research and advocacy coordinator at Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said. Critics say that misinformation that supports Beijing’s narrative, such as conspiracy theories against the US, reach millions of people each day on Chinese social media platforms. In the last few weeks, Chinese social media has been overwhelmed with misinformation about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which China’s state media call “special military operations”. Jia warned that when people could not differentiate truthful information from disinformation, polarisation would intensify in society, and extreme views amplified. This, he said, could lead to an increase in opposing emotions and reflected in the phenomena of anti-officials, anti-wealth and anti-elites. Jia also said that fake information could lead to hostility towards foreigners. His warning came as public opinion in China towards foreign reporters has become increasingly antagonistic as tension between Beijing and the west grows. Foreign journalists in China have reported an increasingly hostile work environment since Beijing expelled more than 20 American journalists in 2021. In its most recent report in January, the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China said Beijing was finding new ways to intimidate foreign reporters. The club also expressed “dismay” last month over restrictions on reporting during the Beijing Winter Olympics, which they said “fell short of international standards”. Beijing frequently uses accusations of fake news to take aim at foreign reporting it deems unfavourable. Last July, Beijing accused the BBC of fake news in its reporting on serious floods in the city of Zhengzhou, slamming the broadcaster for “smearing and attacking China”. Foreign correspondents have reported receiving harassment and streams of vitriol on social media platforms over their reporting from the country’s legion of nationalistic trolls, known as “the little pinks”, who direct fury and vitriol at perceived slights to China’s self-image and sensibilities. A fake news law has also been floated in Hong Kong, where Beijing has been accused of muzzling its free press since mid-2020. The changes in media landscape in the former British colony have prompted independent newsrooms to shut down, hundreds of reporters to lose their jobs, and jitters among its foreign press corps. Right advocates have raised concerns that any content can be arbitrarily censored under the label of “fake news”. “In reality we’ve seen the label of ‘fake news’ used to discredit human rights defenders, and so I’m afraid such a tool could become just another malicious tool for the authorities to silence unwanted opinions and information,” Nee said.",News/World news,Chinese government adviser calls for law to ban ‘fake news’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/chinese-government-adviser-calls-for-law-to-ban-fake-news
3/8/2022,"Shell has announced plans to withdraw from Russian oil and gas and close all its service stations in the country, as the boss of the FTSE 100 company apologised for buying Russian crude oil last week. The company will immediately stop buying Russian crude oil on the spot market and not renew term contracts. It will also change its crude oil supply chain to remove Russian supplies, but said this could take weeks to complete and would lead to reduced throughput at some of its refineries. Shell will also shut its service stations, aviation fuels and lubricants operations in Russia, and start a phased withdrawal from Russian petroleum products, pipeline gas and liquefied natural gas. “This is a complex challenge,” it said in a statement on Tuesday. “Changing this part of the energy system will require concerted action by governments, energy suppliers and customers, and a transition to other energy supplies will take much longer.” Chief executive, Ben van Beurden, said: “We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil to be refined into products like petrol and diesel – despite being made with security of supplies at the forefront of our thinking – was not the right one and we are sorry. “As we have already said, we will commit profits from the limited, remaining amounts of Russian oil we will process to a dedicated fund. We will work with aid partners and humanitarian agencies over the coming days and weeks to determine where the monies from this fund are best placed to alleviate the terrible consequences that this war is having on the people of Ukraine.” A week ago, Shell exited its joint ventures with the Russian state energy firm Gazprom.",News/Business,Shell to halt buying Russian oil and gas and close all service stations in country,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/08/shell-to-halt-buying-russian-oil-and-gas-and-close-all-service-stations-in-country
3/8/2022,"We’ve lost a lot of things. We lost my father. I left my husband behind at the border. My heart is broken because I’ve never been without him. He’s a part of me, the biggest part of me, and now he’s not with me. There are no men with us. On 23 of February, I lost my dad unexpectedly, aged 59. The next day the war began. While many people were leaving Kyiv, my husband and I were trying to sort out funeral documents from all over the city in order to bury Dad. We went from morgue to funeral agency to prosecutor’s office to registry office to morgue to funeral agency. The siren was sounding all sides and tanks drove around the city. We collected almost all the documents, ordered a restaurant for a commemoration, but since the registry office was evacuated, and didn’t give us one final document, the crematorium refused to accept anyone. I’m a Python programmer and I work for a German company, and they helped me leave Ukraine for Poland. We left Kyiv in a small Peugeot 307 car. There were nine of us, me, my mum, my sister, our two husbands, four children and two big dogs, including an elderly German shepherd. It was impossible to move inside the car. We drove for 16 hours to a village about 140km from Kyiv. We decided to leave the village later in the morning because it was dangerous, even there. Near the border with Poland there were a lot of cars and we couldn’t stay in the car for the next three – or five – days, so we decided to walk the last 17km to the border. We left at 4am – it was minus seven degrees. It was a hard trip around mountains and rivers. My kids were crying because of the cold. I wanted to cry too but but I couldn’t give up … it was my idea to go to the border. My dog is 12 and a half and she struggled to walk and fell down every kilometre or so and couldn’t stand up again. I stopped cars and asked for help but everyone refused; they advised us to leave the dogs. But our dogs are part of our family. My dog has experienced all the happy and sad moments with us. Mum’s dog is all she has left of her former life. So my husband, at times, carried our dog on his shoulders. We arrived at the border and there were about five, or perhaps seven, red tents and a big crowd. Just before going into a red tent, a woman asked me to take her 11-year-old daughter and help her pass the time and not get lost – a woman was waiting for her in Poland. Of course I agreed. We stayed in a tent for about seven hours. We were all in there, dogs and five children, all with wet feet. It was hard physically and psychologically – a lot of people around us needed help and medicine. It seemed that these red tents would never end. But when we took our first steps into Poland, when we showed our passes, it was then I realised that we would be OK, that we were in a safe place. My husband couldn’t cross the border because of his age and the mobilisation order. He has gone back to the village to look after his mother and grandmother. There’s only seven of them there and almost everyone is over 60 years old. My sister’s husband is there too, with his parents and a friend of his parents. All of them are in one little house without water. There’s no shop, no pharmacy, no water or food in the village and he and my sister’s husband are using firewood to heat the house. My plan is just, I don’t know. I want my husband here. For now, what I will do with my kids, is decide where I want to stay: here in Poland, or go to Germany, like all of my colleagues. A lot of my friends are still in Ukraine, in Kyiv. Some of them are in Kharkiv in bunkers with little kids. I can’t even imagine what they’re feeling now. We always cry when we watch the TV news, here in Poland. We’re always watching it. I cry because I can’t imagine what’s happening. It was hard to leave Ukraine. At first I lost my dad, and now I leave my husband there. My husband is a big part of me, he is my best friend, assistant, adviser. Our boundless love is what gives me strength now. Everything has remained in Kyiv, life, gadgets, everything. But, these are just things. The only things I left behind in Ukraine are my husband and Dad’s body. My dad is still in the morgue, and I hope that when I come back he’ll still be there. I’ll make it the best funeral I can.",News/World news,Ukraine-Russia crisis: ‘I left my husband behind at the border.

3/8/2022,"While exporting goods or services can often prove transformational for small businesses, the idea can seem unrealistic at first, with many put off by a lack of experience or the cost. In fact, for businesses looking to explore new ways of diversifying and growing, exporting could very well be the next logical step. We met five SME owners with experience of export success, and asked them for their top pieces of advice … Caroline Davis is director of Boxt Socks, a Yorkshire-based brand of novelty socks delivered in fun, quirky packaging. She says:“My business partner, Natalie Prior, and I are both from a design background. Exporting wasn’t something we’d thought about until we spoke to a Department for International Trade adviser and realised how much potential there was. After all, socks are something most people wear! Now around 80% of our goods to independent retailers are sold abroad. We’ve learned plenty – our adviser told us about online marketplaces like Ankorstore, which is based in France and sells to retailers across Europe. They take a commission and handle things like VAT, import tax and shipping, so you don’t need to worry about it, as well as introducing you to retailers. Faire is another similar marketplace, selling to America. We did a lot of research into how different countries buy products, too. Once you start looking into it, there’s a huge amount of help available.” Eleanor Weaver is CEO of the artificial intelligence platform Luminance, which is used by law firms and organisations in 60 countries to read and analyse documents. She says:“With a technology that is completely language-agnostic, we’ve been a global business from day one. That said, when you look to set up satellite offices, have someone who has spent a considerable amount of time with your team take charge of the work. They know your company’s culture, business model and products, so it’s the best way to have your way of working transplanted into a new region. At the same time, be adaptable – having confidence in your tried-and-tested business models is helpful, but each market can be very different. Hosting things like thought-leadership events, breakfasts and lunches are a fantastic way to get your name out there in an informal, yet targeted way. And almost every new market understands the power of ‘free’! A free trial period instils confidence in your business and helps you close new opportunities.” Shalom Lloyd is founder of Naturally Tribal Skincare, an ethically sourced skincare brand that pays homage to Lloyd’s African heritage. She says:“Exporting wasn’t initially something I’d thought of – I figured it was only for large businesses with years of experience. But in 2017, we were selected as an ‘export champion’ by the Commonwealth Enterprise and Investment Council. It meant we were one of 100 outstanding British businesses selected for our potential, ethos and brand values. It gave us an enormous confidence boost – not to mention access to the tools to begin our export journey. More recently, via the Department for International Trade, we were assigned an international trade adviser, who helped us identify our target markets and rework our export action plan post-Brexit. Today, approximately 20% of our customers are from the US and North America, 10% from Africa and 10% from the EU, with the remaining 60% in the UK. Interestingly, we’ve noticed international customers have higher average order values compared to domestic ones.” Bob McDonald is co-owner of the Armagh company Burren Balsamics, manufacturer of whole fruit-infused balsamic vinegars and condiments. He says:“As a food company in Northern Ireland, we sell to many countries in Europe as well as America. We’re also about to start selling in Dubai. Exporting accounts for around 40% of our present turnover – two years ago it was closer to 15%, so the growth has been quite decent. Each country has its own set of challenges. In the US for example, you need to be FDA-approved, and in the United Arab Emirates, it’s helpful to think about things like ensuring labelling is in Arabic, or being Halal-approved. Clear branding and labelling with simple grammar helps. For food businesses, I’d recommend speciality trade shows like the IFE [International Food and Drink Event] where you’ll meet buyers from around the world. Try to understand each country’s importing regulations ahead of approaching buyers.” Sina Yamani is CEO of mobile ordering platform Yoello, designed to enable payments for the hospitality and retail sector. He says:“We partner with acquiring banks and point of sale companies around the world and are currently in 10 different jurisdictions. We trade with the US, Canada, Australia, parts of Europe and Dubai. Exporting for us meant getting to grips with not only different cultures and ways of doing business, but regulatory, legal and compliance issues – every country has its own rules and in regulated environments like fintech, that can be really challenging. There’s also a cost element – not every company can pick up the phone and start dealing with international clients in different time-zones without having measures in place first. We purposely approached English-speaking countries first, but there are subtle nuances between even American English and British English, for example. My advice for other B2B companies like ours?

3/8/2022,"McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and other major western food and drink companies are under mounting pressure to pull out of Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, amid calls for consumer boycotts of the brands. The companies have been criticised for their failure to speak out about the invasion, and for continuing to operate in Russia, while a host of other firms such as Netflix, Levi’s, Burberry and Ikea have halted business in the country. #BoycottMcDonalds and #BoycottCocaCola have been trending on Twitter since the weekend. Other western food and drink chains including Starbucks, KFC and Burger King are also still operating in Russia. Sean Penn, the American actor and film-maker, urged Americans on Twitter to boycott Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and McDonald’s until the companies suspend their operations in Russia. Core Response, the non-profit group he founded in 2010 in response to the Haiti earthquake, is on the ground in Poland helping Ukrainian refugees. Until Coca-Cola, PepsiCo & McDonalds suspend business in Russia, American citizens have a very safe & simple way to stand with Ukraine. Any among us can suspend our purchases of their products & ask our friends to consider doing the same.https://t.co/OGNPJRCjrQ In the UK, Dragon’s Den investor Deborah Meaden has also urged consumers to boycott the fizzy drinks giant Coca-Cola. Can you stop drinking Coca Cola please. They are refusing to withdraw from Russia. Let’s show them some people power. Nicholas Christakis, professor of social and natural science at Yale, has similarly condemned Coca-Cola and McDonald. These companies, @CocaCola & @McDonalds, should be ashamed to engage in commercial interactions in a state that has invaded its neighbor, with much death as a result. https://t.co/GLSADDX8ge #BoycottMcDonalds #BoycottCocaCola According to its website, McDonald’s had 847 outlets in Russia at the end of last year, the vast majority of which are operated directly by the company, as well as 108 restaurants in Ukraine. Starbuck’s, KFC and Pizza Hut are mostly run by franchisees in Russia. One of Coca-Cola’s bottling companies, Coca-Cola HBC, announced last week it had paused production at its factory in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and evacuated employees. McDonald’s and Pepsi, which have had a presence in Russia for decades, have also come under pressure from the boss of New York state’s pension fund. Thomas DiNapoli, comptroller of the New York state common retirement fund, wrote to both companies to urge them to review their businesses in Russia because they face “significant and growing legal, compliance, operational, human rights and personnel, and reputational risks”, Reuters reported. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, also called out the two multinationals, when he told CNN two days ago that “all western companies must withdraw form Russia” on humanitarian grounds. “We were upset to hear companies like Coca-Cola and McDonald’s remain in Russia and continue providing their products.” However, Kathleen Brooks, director at Minerva Analysis, said McDonald’s and Coca Cola were “very complicated businesses”, which did not make it easy to quit Russia. She told the BBC’s Today programme that Coca-Cola had an “incredibly complicated structure” with bottling plants in Russia. “I don’t think it’s as simple as saying can you just pull out of Russia,” she said. “These are complicated businesses and there’s a lot to consider, but right now the reputation risk could really hit their share prices so they may have no choice going forward.” Meanwhile, Swedish flatpack furniture giant Ikea temporarily closed all stores and factories across Russia last week, affecting 15,000 workers, while Germany’s Volkswagen stopped production of vehicles there, and Diageo, which makes Smirnoff vodka and Guinness, said it had paused exports to Russia and Ukraine.

3/8/2022,"Travel isn’t what it used to be, and our taste buds are suffering. But the good news is, you don’t have to leave the UK to taste Spain’s most delicious produce. Food writer Paul Richardson has lived in Spain since 1991, travelling extensively to sample the best food and drink the country has to offer. Here he offers up his pick of seven culinary delights – and the sherry to wash them down with – to bring a sunshiny taste of Spain to your table … SherryFrom the chalky-white soils of Spain’s deep south, fanned by sea breezes, comes a unique and remarkable wine. Long thought of in the UK as good for little more than perking up a trifle, sherry is finally regaining its rightful place among the world’s great wines. Its diversity of styles, from fino and amontillado to oloroso and cream, means that there’s a sherry variety for every occasion and time of day. In its homeland of Andalucía, the light, elegant fino is invariably drunk from a wine glass just like any other white wine, either on its own or to accompany dishes based around fish or shellfish. Amontillado and oloroso, too, are superbly versatile as pairings with food, lending themselves especially well to the rich culinary repertoire of the Spanish south, from cured goat’s cheeses to meat and game casseroles. Cream sherry, meanwhile, is currently all the rage in Andalucía as an aperitif or evening drink, served in a tumbler with ice and a slice of orange. Jamón ibérico de bellotaIt’s the gold standard, the ne plus ultra. Spain’s celebrated ham begins life in the holm-oak forests of western Spain, where troops of black-footed ibérico pigs are let loose in the winter months to feast on acorns; allowing us, in turn, to feast on a ham feted by food-lovers worldwide as the choicest charcuterie of all. A top-of-the-range jamón ibérico bearing the official black quality seal will have been aged for up to three years in the dry cold air of Spain’s central plateau (the best are those from the Guijuelo and Jabugo areas). For an extravagant feast, saving up and splashing out on a whole ham – which will cost upwards of £500 – is a surefire showstopper. For a more down-to-earth indulgence, a vacuum-packed portion of perfect slices is a more affordable treat. Perfect sherry pairing: fino Gamba rojaThough various places lay claim to the “red prawn” – among them Palamós in Girona, Sóller in Mallorca and Dénia in Alicante – the truth is they’re all chasing the same crustacean. Fished on undersea sandbanks along the Mediterranean coast, where they feed on plankton and other microorganisms, the gamba roja commonly fetches a high price in markets all over Spain. This prestigious prawn is famous for its coral-red tint and succulent flesh, and is at its best either raw as tartare, grilled briefly over coals, or sizzled for a few seconds in olive oil – anything more would be a crime. Then get stuck in like the locals do: snap off the heads, suck out the juices, and finally peel the shell from the rest of the body. Prawn perfection. Perfect sherry pairing: manzanilla Mojama de atúnInexplicably little-known beyond its homeland, mojama is poised to become the next Spanish foodie sensation. This supreme delicacy, salt-cured tuna, thought to have been first enjoyed by Roman gourmets, is to the coast of southern Spain what acorn-fed ibérico ham is to the rolling hills of the west. The finest mojama comes from the town of Barbate near Cádiz, where blue-fin tuna are sustainably fished by the ancient almadraba system of fixed nets. The loins of the giant fish are salted and hung to air-dry until they darken and harden into a slab of intense umami flavour. Served in the thinnest of slices – ideally with a handful of fried whole almonds on the side – it makes for a luxurious aperitivo. Perfect sherry pairing: fino Pimentón de la VeraThis punchy spice brings together geography, gastronomy and history in one of the quintessential flavourings of the Latin world. Hailing from the fertile county of La Vera in Extremadura, western Spain, pimentón – known in the UK as smoked paprika – is a russet-red spice made with dried, smoked and ground capsicum peppers. In one or other of its three types, dulce (sweet), agridulce (bittersweet) and picante (hot), pimentón is an irreplaceable feature of many Spanish dishes. Octopus in the Galician style, with cooked potatoes on a wooden plate, would be unthinkable without it, as would Spain’s plethora of cured pork products. Pimentón also lends a little pungent magic to tomato soups, eggs fried in olive oil, and escabeches of tuna, rabbit or partridge. Perfect sherry pairing: amontillado Pedrosillano chickpeasFurther proof, if it were needed, of the Spanish genius for adding value to humble ingredients. Spanish chickpeas come in two main varieties: the blowsy big one, and the flavour-packed little one called garbanzo pedrosillano. It’s the latter that’s most used for cocido, the signature Spanish stew known principally in its Madrid version, cocido madrileño, but consumed in one form or another all over the country. After soaking in water, the chickpeas are slow-cooked with an assortment of meats, including pork and beef, a ham bone, a boiling fowl, and in some places chorizo, morcilla and/or root vegetables, for a winter warmer with few rivals. Perfect sherry pairing: fino or manzanilla Torta del casarOnce upon a time this cheese was a freak, an embarrassment. The makers of sheep’s cheese in the town of Casar de Cáceres aimed for a dense, hard-textured product, but every so often a mysterious transformation occurred and the cheese sank into a flattened shape, the rind bulging with the gooey creaminess inside. Initially, these one-offs never reached the market and were passed around among friends and family. But over time, the cult of torta began to spread, like the velvety richness of its luscious interior. Raw-milk torta del casar is now produced on a large scale, and has become one of Spain’s most highly valued cheeses. To eat, cut open a circle in the rind and scoop out in the manner of a fondue – truly indulgent. Perfect sherry pairing: amontillado Varied, vibrant and versatile, there’s a style of sherry for every occasion – whether you’re looking for an aperitif, table wine or nightcap.

3/8/2022,"For years, sherry was the wine-lovers’ secret; known to most of the UK only as a sweet drink, a neglected, eternally open bottle in grandma’s otherwise empty drinks cabinet. But all that is changing. Sales have increased by 20% since 2019, with more than 7.4m bottles of sherry consumed in 2021. Volumes increased by more than 25% in 2020 according to the market research company Nielsen, with supermarkets from the Co-op to Waitrose reporting significant rises. In March 2020, the month that lockdown was announced, sherry sales in the UK surpassed those in Spain for the first time. “Sherry is such a classy drink,” says professional caterer and supper club host Milli Taylor. Thanks to the fact her parents have lived in Malaga for the past 20 years, Taylor didn’t need a drinks revolution to discover a taste for Andalucía’s finest. In southern Spain, she visits great little bars where you can try a range of sherries, your tally written in chalk on the bar, and she’s thrilled that the UK has finally found a taste for it too. One of sherry’s greatest gifts is its huge diversity of styles. Lighter, drier sherries such as fino and manzanilla offer an exciting start to a meal, and match with an amazing range of foods, from seafood to tomato-based dishes. Meanwhile rich, savoury amontillado and oloroso make great accompaniments to meat or cheese, and cream sherries or the dark, sweet pedro ximénez (PX) are perfect with – or as – dessert. With the exception of PX, all sherries are made from the palomino grape, which is fairly unremarkable until it is fortified and added to a tower of barrels called a solera system, where each year’s juice trickles in and tops up its predecessors. “That this one grape from one area can make such a multitude of different styles is amazing,” says Dan Whine, head of wine at the Petersham Cellars restaurant group, who credits sherry with getting him interested in wine in the first place. Holidaymakers might be familiar with sherry as an accompaniment to tapas – and well they should. “Tapas without sherry is like a pie without a pint!” says Taylor. “It’s hard to beat a crisp glass of fino or manzanilla with some salty nibbles; chorizo, fried almonds, little pickled sardines, nothing complicated.” But this is far from all this versatile drink has to offer. “It can be salty, nutty, sweet, and can make so many great cocktails,” says Whine. The Spanish themselves mix fino with lemonade for a cocktail called a rebujito, but as sherry’s popularity has grown, mixologists have taken this versatility and run with it. Lucas Campbell, a manager at Spanish-themed restaurant group Camino, uses sherry in a number of his most crowd-pleasing cocktails. One of his favourites is a sherry martini that plays with the drink’s Mediterranean origin; he blends it with gin and rosemary, and garnishes with jamón, gordal olives “and a drop of the olive’s oil to make it dirty”. He also makes a sangria using amontillado, a dry style that has more depth and age than the lighter finos or manzanillas. “I add orange and cloves for that winter vibe, and the amontillado brings nuttiness and caramel,” he says. “Whenever a group orders a jug of it, everybody at the next table wants to know what it is, and I’ll be making it for the rest of the night!” Taylor also loves to introduce naysayers to sherry, and once persuaded a reluctant pub landlord to let her sell sherry at an Andalucían pop-up she held on his premises. Even though he had his doubts, Taylor proved him wrong – the diners loved it. “So many people think they won’t like sherry, but then when I get them to try a fino they’re often surprised to find it’s rather like a dry white wine,” she says. “You can see their ears perk up when I explain that we keep it in the fridge, just like a white wine, but that thanks to the fact it’s fortified, it’ll be drinkable for longer.” For foodies looking to take meals to the next level, sherry is the perfect pairing. “It stands up really well to poultry,” says Whine. “Chicken and amontillado is just beautiful.” Meanwhile, for those with a sweet tooth, Taylor recommends soaking raisins in PX or sloshing a bit of it into a chocolate tart – “PX and chocolate is classic!” All three agree that once people discover sherry, they fall in love with it. “It’s so much fun getting people to try it for the first time,” Taylor says. “It’s such a delicate, delicious drink.” Campbell agrees, adding: “Often customers love this novel taste so much they ask where they can try more. It’s that beautiful moment where you open up someone’s world a bit.” And that, surely, is the biggest reason for sherry’s newfound popularity: it’s not just one drink but a whole range, all with exciting possibilities that make the world a bigger, more delicious place. Varied, vibrant and versatile, there’s a style of sherry for every occasion – whether you’re looking for an aperitif, table wine or nightcap.

3/8/2022,"Sherry is the drink that has everything: a style for every occasion, a fascinating 3,000-year history, and an affordable price point. Most of us know dry sherry as a great pre-dinner drink: savoury and saline, an ideal match for salted nuts or sliced ham. But this supremely versatile wine can do much more for a meal than simply rouse your appetite for it. Not only is there a style for every course, but sherry’s extraordinary powers mean that ingredients such as artichokes and tomatoes, which are famously hard to match with wine, partner beautifully with it – as do fish and meats, cheeses and even chocolate. Despite its many incarnations – from light and dry to rich and sweet – sherry isn’t a difficult wine to understand; quite the opposite. All sherry comes from Andalucía in sunny southern Spain, and except for the very sweetest style which uses the rich, sundried pedro ximénez grape, it is always made from one variety, palomino. As sherry is blended in a trickle-down barrel system called a solera, there are no vintages to remember, and thanks to the fact it’s lightly fortified, there’s the bonus that an open bottle will keep for a week or so in the fridge. Ready to explore the world of sherry for yourself? Here are six of its most convivial food pairings to get you started … Manzanilla with fishThe two driest sherry styles – light in colour and feel, with appetising acidity and lovely, comforting yeasty notes – are fino and manzanilla. The only real difference between them is the place they are aged; in the case of manzanilla, it’s at the town of Sanlúcar de Barrameda, on the coast where the Guadalquivir River meets the Atlantic, and somehow a fresh saltiness ends up in the wine. Perhaps this proximity to the sea is the reason manzanilla is such a great match for fish: from sushi to smoked salmon, fresh oysters to grilled squid – and even fish and chips – it acts like a squeeze of lemon, bringing out the flavour. Fino with artichokesThe cruel truth, for those of us who love both wine and artichokes, is that the two don’t love each other. Cynarin, a compound in the vegetable, supposedly heightens our sense of sweetness – although personally, I’ve always found artichoke makes most wines tinny and querulous, as well. The exception is fino, which retains all its delicate, perfumed nuttiness – fresh bread and roasted almonds – when confronted with this spiky vegetable. Better still, the wine performs the same trick with another ingredient that gives sommeliers headaches: tomato. So next time either of these tricky characters are on the menu, think fino. Your tastebuds will thank you. Cream sherry with patéCream sherry – a sweeter, blended version invented by Harvey’s in the 19th century for the British market – is the style many of us think of first when sherry crops up, and while it’s generally agreed that it is an excellent match for blue cheese, it can also show to advantage earlier in the meal, with paté – especially one that has a touch of spice. The wine serves as an equivalent of the fruit chutneys that tend to work so well with this sort of starter, the alcohol balancing out the richness while the sweetness rounds out the meat. An unconventional but exciting combination. Oloroso with steakOloroso is the richest of the dry sherry styles and, while it does come in sweeter versions, those aren’t the ones I’d serve with a good piece of beef. The secret is a splash of the wine on the meat as it cooks: this is the best steak seasoning you’ll ever find, with the added advantage of making the wine match a no-brainer. The flavours of cinnamon, figs and hazelnuts in oloroso make good pairings for all sorts of red meat – from grilled chops to thick stews and slow roasts mellowing in their own juices – while the alcohol slices through the meat grain like a well sharpened knife. Palo cortado with mushroomsNobody is quite sure why a sherry becomes a palo cortado – but nobody is sorry when it does. These are the finest wines of the bodega, and the name refers to the mark on the barrel that signifies the contents’ special character. Palo cortado is fortified to a slightly higher level than its drier siblings (17%), and aged for longer. The result has the delicacy of a fino but the power of an oloroso, and pairs particularly well with mushrooms. Whether you are eating boeuf bourguignon with button mushrooms, a portobello mushroom burger, or a Chinese-style soup with shiitake, this is the perfect accompaniment. Pedro ximenez (PX) with chocolateOften cited as the sweetest wine in existence, PX has the luscious, raisiny decadence of a lusted-after dessert. This dark, unctuous drink is fabulous at the end of a meal, poured over ice-cream or served in a glass as an accompaniment to a chunk of dark chocolate, a gooey brownie or an airy souffle. But the truth is, PX doesn’t need a foodie partner to make a statement; simply sipping this extraordinary wine is a deliciously decadent way to round off a meal.

3/8/2022,"If you are fed up of a mundane desk job, aren’t bothered by austere conditions and have an affection for the hirsute, a potentially ideal new role has opened up in Montana: a grizzly bear conflict manager. For a salary between $79,363 and $103,176, the US government is offering one lucky applicant the chance to spend time in the Montana wilderness, dealing with discord within the world of grizzly bears. The disputes aren’t between ursine combatants themselves – although territorial quarrels do occur – but in the friction between bears and humans. While grizzly attacks on people are exceptionally rare, farmers can become agitated if a bear preys on livestock, while residents have raised concerns over bears tearing their way into their garbage, seeking tasty morsels. The job, listed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, involves managing a team of two to four, with tasks including “trapping, chemical immobilization, monitoring, conflict prevention and relocation efforts”. The role can be based within 100 miles of Missoula, Bozeman or Kalispell in Montana, though the advert makes clear the successful applicant will not be spending much time in the “adequately lighted, heated and ventilated office” pondering the hefty delights of grizzly bears. There is a “substantial” amount of field work, involving walking in wet, rocky and otherwise harsh terrain, sometimes requiring the use of boats, small aircraft and all-terrain vehicles. “Extended periods of camping in tents or cabins in remote field camps may occur,” the advert states, adding that a “variety of temperature and weather extremes may be encountered while in the field”. “The incumbent may be subject to large numbers of biting insects and may be required to work in close proximity to large animals such as bear and moose,” the ad warns, adding that the conflict manager may have to carry a gun for protection. The applicant must be strong enough to lift a 50lb weight, although directly grappling with a bear is not required or encouraged. Grizzly bears are known for their humped shoulders and sheer bulk, weighing up to 1,000lb. The creatures were once found throughout the US west and into central Mexico but European colonization resulted in such rampant hunting and severe habitat loss that they now occupy just 3% of that historic range. Listed as an endangered species by the US government, pockets of grizzly bears remain in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. In recent years, they have started to recover. As the bears have started to spread from these isolated populations, they have come into increasing contact with the growing human population in the US west, particularly farmers and those living in small rural towns. This has, on rare occasion, led to attacks on people, leading to calls from Republican legislators in Montana for the ban on hunting grizzlies to be lifted. The federal government has resisted such pressure, instead focusing on efforts to reduce conflict by encouraging better garbage storage, improved fencing around livestock and warning campers to not sleep with food in their tents.",News/US news,Wanted: grizzly bear conflict manager – grappling with bears not required,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/08/wanted-grizzly-bear-conflict-manager-grappling-with-bears-not-required
3/8/2022,"Residents of a high-rise building in east London said they had complained about the fire alarms and “stay put” policy before a major fire broke out there on Monday. The London fire brigade (LBF) was called to the Relay Building in Whitechapel High Street shortly before 4pm after a fire started in a 17th-floor flat. At least 20 fire engines and 125 firefighters tackled the blaze, while footage showed flames pouring out of the building and debris falling off the side. LBF said a woman was trapped by the blaze and firefighters rescued her using a fire escape hood. A number of residents have said they could not hear any fire alarms sounding during the incident and were alerted to the fire by word of mouth. Andrew Meikle, 58, who has lived in the 22-storey building for about five years, said the residents had complained several times about the alarms and the “stay put” policy to the three different companies that manage the building: John D Wood, Network Homes and Rendall and Rittner. He said: “There have been complaints about fire alarms, the ‘stay put’ policy and the high risk of fires on the wooden balconies, and guess what was burning today? The wooden balconies.” He added that with three different companies managing different parts of the building, there was a “scrambled” chain of communication when it came to their complaints. Younus Hussein, 61, who lives on the seventh floor of the building, said he also did not hear any alarm. “If I did not hear the persistent knocks of my neighbours, I would probably still be asleep,” he said. Lynn Ling, a London School of Economics student from China who lives on the 20th floor with her husband, Yuri, said the whole incident has been “very scary”. Ling, who was wearing a silver security blanket because she forgot her coat in the scramble to evacuate, said she was alerted to the fire by a friend who FaceTimed her from the street at about 4:30pm. She said: “I did not hear an alarm. I think there was a fire alarm on the ground floor but I could not hear it clearly on the 20th.” Rachel, from Nottinghamshire, who did not want to give her last name, said she was staying at a friend’s flat on the 10th floor of the block in Whitechapel as she visited London to celebrate her 50th birthday. She said she put her head out into the corridor and heard a young boy scream: “Get out, there’s a fire.” She added: “If it had not been for him I would have had no idea there was a fire. There was no alarm on the 10th floor.” A spokesperson for Network Homes said: “We’re pleased to see everyone has been safely evacuated from the building. “As soon as we became aware of the situation we sent a team to the building to provide support to residents, and they remained on site into the evening. “Network Homes is a leaseholder of 75 flats across floors 7-11 of this building. Overall responsibility for the building lies with the freeholder, and we actively engage with their managing agent on fire safety measures.” John D Wood and Rendall and Rittner have been contacted for comment.",News/UK news,Whitechapel tower fire: residents say they did not hear fire alarms,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/08/whitechapel-tower-fire-london
