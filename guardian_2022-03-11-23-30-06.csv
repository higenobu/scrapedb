3/11/2022,"Russia has moved to block Instagram after its parent company, Meta, said it would allow calls for violence against Vladimir Putin and Russian soldiers involved in the invasion of Ukraine to appear on the social media platform. Russian prosecutors demanded that access to Instagram be blocked on Friday due to media reports of the relaxation of its policies on hate speech related to the war. Russia’s general prosecutor’s office said in a statement it had moved to recognise Meta as an “extremist organisation and ban its activities on the territory of Russia”, adding that the platform had also been used to incite “mass riots accompanied by violence”. Several Russian regional governors also deleted their Instagram accounts on Friday, the RIA Novosti state news agency reported. Meta is also the parent company of Facebook, which the Russian government blocked access to last week, and WhatsApp, one of Russia’s most popular messaging applications. It is not yet clear if WhatsApp will also be targeted by government regulators. The crackdown on the social media giant will further limit most Russians’ access to outside information on the war, increasing the influence of state media. Putin last week signed off on new legislation that threatens Russians accused of sharing “fake information” about the war to up to 15 years in prison. Meta’s decision to allow speech targeting Russians is part of an extraordinary wave of corporate activism over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with hundreds of brands exiting the Russian market. The invasion has led to thousands of deaths and created a refugee crisis in Europe with more than 2 million people fleeing Ukraine after just two weeks of war. “As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech such as ‘death to the Russian invaders’. We still won’t allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement, according to Reuters. In an email recently sent to moderators, Meta highlighted a change in its hate speech policy pertaining both to Russian soldiers and to Russians in the context of the invasion, Reuters reported. “We are issuing a spirit-of-the-policy allowance to allow T1 violent speech that would otherwise be removed under the hate speech policy when: (a) targeting Russian soldiers, EXCEPT prisoners of war, or (b) targeting Russians where it’s clear that the context is the Russian invasion of Ukraine (eg content mentions the invasion, self-defence, etc),” it said in the email.",News/World news,Russia to block Instagram after Meta relaxes Putin hate speech,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/russia-to-block-instagram-after-meta-relaxes-putin-hate-speech
3/11/2022,"Disney has been accused of cutting LGBTQ+ content from the films of Pixar, the animation giant and Disney subsidiary, during the editing process. A letter from a group of employees of Pixar – the studio behind Toy Story, The Incredibles and Inside Out – claimed Disney executives have “barred” moments of gay affection from films before they are released. Signed by “the LGBTQIA+ employees of Pixar & their allies”, the letter says: “We at Pixar have personally witnessed beautiful stories, full of diverse characters, come back from Disney corporate reviews shaved down to crumbs of what they once were.” It adds: “Nearly every moment of overtly gay affection is cut at Disney’s behest … Even if creating LGBTQIA+ content was the answer to fixing the discriminatory legislation in the world, we are being barred from creating it.” First reported by Judd Legum of Popular Information, the statement is the latest development in a crisis for Disney prompted by the company’s response to the controversial “Don’t Say Gay” bill which passed in the Florida state legislature on Tuesday. Officially known as the Parental Rights in Education bill, it seeks to ban teaching of sexual identity and gender orientation in early-grade education as well as in “a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students”. The wording of the latter has been attacked as so vague that it may effectively enable parents to prevent discussion of the topics at any age. The bill is currently awaiting a signature from state governor Ron DeSantis. The letter came in response to a company memo sent by Disney CEO Bob Chapek on Monday after Disney failed to make a public statement in opposition to the bill, and revelations that every politician who sponsored the bill had received donations from Disney. Chapek defended the lack of opposition to the bill, saying: “Corporate statements do very little to change outcomes or minds … they can be counterproductive and undermine more effective ways to achieve change.” He added: “I believe the best way for our company to bring about lasting change is through the inspiring content we produce, the welcoming culture we create, and the diverse community organisations we support.” Pointing out that Disney has already stopped commercial activities in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine and threatened to boycott the state of Georgia over its planned Religious Liberties bill in 2016, the Pixar employees group says the company’s claims “ring hollow”. Chapek, who became CEO of Disney in 2020 after Robert Iger stepped down, is thought to want to step back from the kind of advocacy that flourished under Iger, with the Hollywood Reporter suggesting that Chapek is “concerned that Disney might be viewed as too liberal”. Disney has been contacted for a response.",Arts/Film,Disney accused of removing gay content from Pixar films ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/11/disney-pixar-employees-gay-content
3/11/2022,"Russia is preparing to put before the UN unfounded claims of a US-orchestrated biological weapon plot in Ukraine, as the Kremlin announced 16,000 foreign fighters from the Middle East would be sent to the eastern European country. The UN security council is meeting on Friday at Russia’s request to discuss Moscow’s claim that the US-backed laboratories in Ukraine were working on biological weapons to target Russians. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, along with western military intelligence, fears Russia is preparing the ground for its own chemical weapon attack. “Allegedly, we are preparing a chemical attack,” he said in a video address on Thursday. “This makes me really worried, because we’ve been repeatedly convinced: if you want to know Russia’s plans, look at what Russia accuses others of.” Russian forces, meanwhile, continued their advance into Ukraine, bombing cities in the west of the country, including Lviv, Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk. Elsewhere, satellite photos appeared to show a massive convoy outside Kyiv had largely dispersed and redeployed. The US space technology company Maxar said its pictures showed armoured units had fanned out through towns and forests in the area, with artillery moved into potential firing positions. In Moscow, Vladimir Putin announced 16,000 foreign “volunteers” from the Middle East were ready to fight with Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine to “help” the people living in the Donbas region. In a meeting with Russia’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu, Putin also said western-made weapons including Javelin and Stinger missilesthat were captured by the Russian army would be handed to Donbas forces. As heavy shelling continued across eastern Ukraine’s towns and cites, Ukrainian authorities reported Russia had now killed more civilians than soldiers. Russian forces were also reported to have hit a psychiatric hospital near Izyum, a town in the Kharkiv region. The regional governor, Oleh Synegubov, called it a “war crime against civilians [and] genocide against the Ukrainian nation”. He said 330 people had been in the hospital at the time, including wheelchair users and those unable to move. The exact number of casualties is still to be established. In the besieged port city of Mariupol conditions remain desperate, with people trapped inside indoor shelters with no heat, electricity and little or no food. More than 1,300 people have died in the 10-day siege, said Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk, said. “They [Russia] want to destroy the people of Mariupol. They want to make them starve. It’s a war crime,” she added. The Associated Press spoke to an exhausted-looking resident, as he pulled a cart loaded with bags down an empty street flanked by damaged buildings in the port city. “I don’t have a home anymore. That’s why I’m moving,” Aleksander Ivanov said. “It doesn’t exist anymore. It was hit, by a mortar.” More than 400,000 people remain trapped in Mariupol, which is surrounded by Russian forces, and basic supplies are running out. About 200,000 are believed to want to leave amid continuous Russian bombardment but have not been able to do so despite the daily declaration of humanitarian corridors. Meanwhile, a UN spokesperson said there were credible reports of Russians using cluster munitions in populated areas. Cluster munitions, which scatter small bombs over a large area, are banned by more than 100 countries, including the UK, but not Russia, Ukraine or the US. More than 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine and a further two million are internally displaced within the country, the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, said on Friday. The grim toll for Ukrainian civilians comes amid growing fears that Russia could stage a chemical attack, as senior Russian officials recycled old conspiracy theories about alleged western-made biological weapons. The head of the Russian military’s radiation, chemical and biological protection troops, Igor Kirillov, said on Thursday that US-backed labs in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa were working on dangerous pathogens, custom-designed to target Russians and other Slavs. According to Russian-state media, Kirillov alleged the US planned to exploit Ukraine’s “unique geographical position” by sending migratory birds carrying deadly diseases into Russia. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, made a similar claim on Thursday, alleging that US-backed labs in Ukraine were working to “develop ethnically targeted biological weapons”. The director of the CIA, William Burns, told the US Senate intelligence committee that Russia may be laying the groundwork for a chemical or biological attack of its own, which it would then blame on the US or Ukraine in a “false flag operation”. “This is something, as all of you know very well, is very much a part of Russia’s playbook,” he said. “They’ve used these weapons against their own citizens, they’ve at least encouraged the use in Syria and elsewhere, so it’s something we take very seriously.” The EU announced it would more than double its military aid to Ukraine to €1bn (£840m). In a watershed moment three days into the invasion, the bloc said it would deliver offensive weapons to a country for the first time, with a promise of €500m in military aid. Meeting in Versailles, the EU’s 27 heads of state and government, however, rebuffed Ukraine’s request for a fast-track plan to join the bloc. “We will further strengthen our bonds and deepen our partnership to support Ukraine in pursuing its European path. Ukraine belongs to our European family,” the leaders said in a post-summit declaration that called on EU officials in Brussels to give an opinion on membership applications from Ukraine, but also Georgia and Moldova, both of whom quickly followed Kyiv with their own efforts to join. EU leaders also said they were “ready to move quickly” with further sanctions on Russia. The US is expected to step up the pressure, with an announcement later on Friday that it will revoke Russia’s “most favoured nation status” at the World Trade Organization. Losing this status means virtually all Russian products will be subject to high tariffs, a trade status assigned only to North Korea and Belarus. Canada made the move last week and the EU, which is Russia’s biggest trading partner, also supports the plan. The UK announced on Friday it would impose sanctions against 386 members of the Russian parliament who voted to recognise two Russian-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine as independent countries. The politicians, who are already under EU sanctions, will now be banned from travelling to the UK and accessing any assets stored in the country.",News/World news,Russia to go to UN with its claims of US-backed biological weapon plot,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/russia-un-claims-us-backed-biological-weapon-plot-kremlin-foreign-fighters-ukraine
3/11/2022,"More than two weeks since the war in Ukraine began, millions of people have fled their homes and thousands have been killed. Here are some of the latest figures on the conflict. According to the United Nations, there had been 549 civilian deaths and 957 injuries in Ukraine as of 10 March, although it believes the real total could be considerably higher. Of those killed, 26 have been confirmed to have been children. The Ukrainian regions with the most casualties are Donetsk and Luhansk, which have had a total of 123 deaths and 485 injuries. The US military estimates that between 2,000 and 4,000 Ukrainian armed forces, national guard and volunteer forces have been killed. It estimates that between 5,000 and 6,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Ukrainian armed forces say more than 12,000 Russian troops have been killed since 24 February. According to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, the invasion has resulted in more than 2.3 million people fleeing Ukraine. Most of these refugees – 1.5 million – have fled to Poland. The countries with the next largest refugee populations caused by the conflict are Hungary, Slovakia and Moldova. Poland’s interior minister, Mariusz Kamiński, said on 24 February that the country would open nine refugee centres. According to the First News, a Polish news outlet, the first reception centre opened in the western bus terminal in Warsaw. The reception centres provide information, food and aid to people who have fled the conflict. The EU has donated €500m in arms and other aid to the Ukrainian military. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said: “For the first time ever, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack. On Monday this week the UK government said it was now the largest bilateral donor to Ukraine, having donated £100m in aid. Other countries that have donated military power to Ukraine include the US, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Spain and the Netherlands. McDonald’s has said it is closing roughly 850 stores in Russia, while Starbucks will close 100 stores. Other companies that have said they are suspending operations in Russia include Pepsi and Coca-Cola. Shell said it planned to withdraw from the Russian oil and gas market. According to OVD-Info, an independent Russian human rights media group that monitors protests, more than 13,912 people have been detained for participating in anti-war actions in Russia since 24 February. It has been reported that anti-war protests have taken place in 53 cities in Russia. Oil prices rose to their highest levels since 2008 on 7 March, with the price of Brent crude reaching almost $140 a barrel. The US said on 8 March it would ban imports of Russian oil.",News/World news,"Russia-Ukraine war in numbers: casualties, refugees and aid",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/russia-ukraine-war-numbers-casualties-refugees-aid

Usually, the old masters, and mistresses including Artemisia Gentileschi, portrayed the ancient Roman heroine Lucretia preparing to kill herself after she was raped by the tyrant Tarquin. She is conventionally pictured raising a knife to herself rather than live in shame. But Titian takes us to the truth of what happened, as he imagines it, a terrible confrontation in which a naked woman is assaulted by an armed man in a virulent frenzy. Titian captures the rush and force of the attack as Tarquin grabs his victim’s arm and puts his knee between her legs. Her nudity is vulnerable, his armour unyielding. His face is flushed with rage, her expression beseeching as she tries to connect with some hidden layer of humanity in her rapist. It leaves you troubled, as this great artist wants you to be.

3/11/2022,"These are fascinating times for rugby league. On the field, there is the prospect of a World Cup in England this autumn, and domestically, Super League has been buoyed by a strong start to the new season and its new broadcast arrangement with Channel 4. There is just as much intrigue off the field too, with the game about to embark on a new realignment of governance that could have far-reaching implications for everyone connected with the game. But what exactly does “realignment” mean? Last week, the Rugby Football League and Super League announced they had agreed heads of terms on a deal which would unite the two major entities and, in their opinion, bulletproof the sport long-term. The major change? The creation of a joint-venture company called Rugby League Commercial, which will handle all broadcast, marketing and events rights for the sport, enabling it to deliver a clear and unified game-wide vision to prospective new partners. Super League has made no secret of its desire to follow in the footsteps of rugby union and attract a new partner to the game, potentially opening it up to more people than ever before. But privately, there is caution in the corridors of the game about how CVC’s relationship with Premiership Rugby will play out long-term. It was that concern which led to two of the game’s most prominent figures, the Leeds chief executive, Gary Hetherington, and the St Helens owner, Eamonn McManus, to convince clubs to pull away from a private equity deal last summer that would have seen Super League sell a significant stake. There is already widespread discussion that IMG, the globally-renowned brand that has significant interest in Ultimate Fighting Chamionship (UFC) among other sports, are hovering in the background. The Guardian has been told that by the summer, a strategic partner will be brought to the table and talks will accelerate with the newly-founded commercial arm of the sport’s governance about how best to propel rugby league to the masses ahead of the World Cup. “This is about making the sport stronger and boosting participation, growth and interest,” the RFL’s chief regulatory officer, Karen Moorhouse, says. “We’re exploring the possibility of strategic partners, but their role has to be to maximise our potential. We’re always mindful of what’s happening with similar arrangements in other sports and we have to learn from that. We’re only interested in someone who’ll bring new knowledge and expertise.” Hetherington and McManus are at the forefront of the talks but come the summer, Rugby League Commercial will be launched complete with a five-person board with two directors appointed by the RFL, two by Super League and a jointly appointed chair – with all five to be independent from club ties. This, insiders say, is a crucial step forwards for a sport which has constantly bickered with itself over whether the RFL or Super League are best-equipped to take the game forward. Now, the power over major decisions including broadcast and events rights is being effectively taken out of their hands. All 12 of the Super League clubs have approved the proposals, and they will be taken to a meeting of the rest of the professional game later this month. With an enshrined financial model that will provide the lower-league clubs with a slice of the revenues any new commercial arm generates, there is unlikely to be opposition. For the first time in a long time, there is unity among the corridors of rugby league. “Ultimately, this is about maximising the value of the sport and maximising what we can distribute to our clubs at all levels,” Moorhouse says. It means that the RFL and Super League effectively lose some of their power in regards to decision-making, with Super League Europe, the holding company of the competition, effectively demoted to a vehicle which will act as a representative forum for the 12 clubs. Insiders also believe the RFL board may also streamline as a result too. “But if you’re a big strategic partner like IMG and you see one body, RL Commercial, working with you on a deal rather than two parties squabbling over who is best, it’s a no-brainer for rugby league,” one Super League executive told the Guardian. The only frustration for fans, perhaps, is that it has taken this long to reach this point.",Sport/Sport,New deal and unity in rugby league bodes well in World Cup year,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/11/new-deal-and-unity-in-rugby-league-bodes-well-in-world-cup-year
3/11/2022,"Irealise this may provoke a lot of eye-rolling, but the other day I went to a Domaine Romanée-Conti (DRC) tasting (for the benefit of those who aren’t familiar with it, this is one of the world’s most famous – and most expensive – wines). Obviously, there’s an element of frustration involved in that: unless I won the lottery, I’d never be able to afford a bottle, and I’m not even sure I’d want to – it’s delicious, of course, but at about £21,000 a pop, is DRC really 400 or 500 times better than the amount you’d pay for a less-feted burgundy? I have to admit, though, that once you’ve tasted a really good pinot – and it doesn’t have to cost a fraction as much - it’s there gnawing away at you, making you long to sip something similar. It’s not just the fruit – a 2019 DRC I tried at that tasting was like an utterly perfect raspberry – but also the silky texture, once described, as only the French can, as “le petit Jésus en culotte de velours” (little Jesus in velvet breeches). Um, whatever, but it does slip down the throat a real treat. A lot of new-world wine makers are a bit in love with burgundy styles, too. You’ll find some of the best in New Zealand, especially Martinborough and Central Otago, which incidentally make very different styles (it would be worth setting up a tasting to compare). California, Oregon, South Africa’s Hemel-en-Aarde valley and Australia’s Mornington Peninsula are also fertile hunting grounds. Does that mean that pinot that doesn’t reach these dizzy heights isn’t worth drinking? Not at all. What a lot of cheaper pinot offers – particularly younger pinots from warmer climates – is the most delectable, sweet, summer-puddingy fruit. Under the £10 mark, Chile is your best bet, while Romania has a distinctive but still delicious dark-fruited style. Two other more unexpected sources that any pinotphile should explore are Germany, where it’s known as spätburgunder, and England (yes, of all places). If you’re snapping up the Dealuri pinot noir from Aldi in today’s panel, pick up a bottle of the same store’s delicate, pretty Specially Selected Pinot Noir Early (£10.99, 11.5%) from the excellent 2018 vintage, which is made by Sixteen Ridges in Herefordshire. I can’t say I like the “Bowler & Brolly” branding, but the wine is charming. If you want to show off your pinot at a meal, by the way, the best ingredient is duck, followed closely by rare roast lamb or a mushroom risotto. But steer clear of stinky cheeses. Dealuri Romanian Pinot Noir £4.99 in store , £5.99 online, Aldi, 12.5%. Typical of the darker, plum and mulberry style you get from Romania, and delicious. This pinot is more suited to lamb or mushrooms than to duck. Adnams Pinot Noir Valle Central 2021 £7.99, 13%. Fresh, light, pretty – and remarkably good value. Could easily drink with fish. Nautilus Southern Valleys Pinot Noir 2017 £19 The Wine Society, 13.5%. A sumptuous summer pudding of a wine with the added benefit of a couple of years’ maturity. Karl Johner Kaiserstuhl Pinot Noir 2017 £19.79 (on offer) DBM Wines, 13.5%. German pinot noir is one of the wine world’s best-kept secrets. A really elegant wine that you could easily mistake for a top burgundy. Domaine Laurent Mouton Givry 1er Cru Clos Jus 2019 £32 Tanners, 14%.

3/11/2022,"On the whole I try to avoid wading into culture wars, but occasionally it is simply unavoidable. There are some battle lines where the fissures – along philosophical, generational and lifestyle divisions – just cannot be ignored, however painful they may be to touch upon. I am talking, of course, about whether you wear black or white trainers. Like it or not, this is footwear’s key frontier, the victory of comfort over chic having put to bed the heels-v-flats debate. Plenty of people still wear high heels sometimes – me, for instance – but few of us now identify as full-time heel wearers. I still love the blast of energy that stepping into high heels can bring, like a well-timed key change in a Whitney ballad. But on the whole, heels are going the way of cufflinks and wing collars and hat pins. We are all flats wearers now. Except it’s never that simple, is it? Now that everyone wears flats and most people wear trainers, the kind of trainers you wear matters more than ever. Of course, there are many people who have always believed that the exact type of trainer you wear is of utmost importance – if you are one, please feel free to eye-roll at my ignorant ramblings and move on. I’m talking about how the adoption of trainers by a demographic with no understanding of trainer culture (people like me) has changed the game. A decade ago, a whole bunch of Generation X-ers who assumed they’d “grown out of” trainers began wearing them again. Blame the 2008 financial crash, blame Phoebe Philo taking a bow at Celine in 2011, blame athleisure, minimalism or gender-free dressing – it doesn’t really matter. Wearing trainers with smart day clothes went mainstream. Trainers with a trouser suit, which once marked you out as a self-consciously Creative Type, was suddenly the go-to look for CEOs doing Ted Talks and politicians on walkabouts. Women needing a shoe that was practical for the commute and smart for the office, ditched their ballet pumps for Adidas Stan Smiths. These newbies gravitated towards trainers slender of sole, with clean, horizontal lines and minimal bounce. Think Veja, or Common Projects, or the Gucci ones with red-and-green stripes. Their flat, minimal silhouette is similar to that of a leather loafer, or a Chanel pump. It’s technically a trainer, but in its soul it’s a smart shoe. Some men have gravitated to black, which makes sense, because formal menswear is traditionally dark. I’m thinking of the black leather trainers with contrasting white soles – probably by Hugo Boss or Axel Arigato – which men drinking espresso in Italian airports always wear, as does everyone in the manager’s dugout for a Champions League football match. But women who adopt a midlife trainer mostly opt for white. A box-fresh white trainer looks eye-catchingly pristine, which is reassuring if a small part of you still worries that trainers look scruffy. It is a less prissy version of the nude court shoe, basically. The white trainer has become the establishment trainer. Which means younger, cooler trainer-wearers have started to look elsewhere. White trainers are more mainstream, a bit older. Black trainers are a little edgier, cooler, younger. That’s how it looks from where I stand, anyway. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, right?",Lifestyle/Fashion,"There are few black-and-white issues in fashion, but the trainers you wear is one | Jess Cartner-Morley",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/11/there-are-few-black-and-white-issues-in-fashion-but-the-trainers-you-wear-is-one
3/11/2022,"It was the week the 14-year-olds chose their GCSEs, and therefore a big growth-mindset week for me, one in which I was happy to discover a whole new vista of my own ignorance and wrong-headedness. Goodbye, then, all those things I used to know. Cool people don’t do history any more, it’s just out-of-date politics. But don’t be fooled, they don’t do politics either, that isn’t a thing. Now they do geography. You’ll notice not that much has changed; we had to choose between history and geography in 1989, round about the year GCSEs were invented. Nor have the contours of the Earth, or mysterious centrality of the oxbow lake, changed all that much. Sometimes when I attempt to share my experience, I see a trace of something like a tactfully masked surprise pass over their faces. God knows, I don’t want to interrogate, so I’m guessing here: but I think they’re surprised that school existed when I was a kid. I think they think I learned to read from maybe a local witch or shaman and then moved directly from there to whatever it is I do. Anyway, some things have changed: you can now choose computer science, but only if you don’t want to do Italian; and PE is a potential qualification rather than a time-filling exercise in sadism; and you must never say “biology, chemistry and physics”, only “triple science”, like it’s an ice-cream or an espresso. But most importantly, at some point over the intervening 30 or so years, it has become none of your parent’s business what you do. Their opinions, should they choose to share them, should be greeted by you doing the exact opposite of that, pour encourager les autres. So I’m trying a new strategy. “Pah, exams, what do you want to do those for? You should stick it to the man!” I can let you know how that panned out, two and a half years from now. It was International Women’s Day and I was due to chair a panel: Shaista Aziz, journalist and campaigner, one of The Three Hijabis who finally, after decades, enabled those of us who don’t follow football to be authentically interested in the Euros last year; Kate Hudson from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament; the political economist Yuliya Yurchenko; Aliona Lyasheva from the sociology faculty at the University of Kyiv; and Inna Berezkina, from Russia’s School of Civic Education. Trying to map a feminist discussion at a time like this rams home the reality of the situation. Talking about violence against women when rape is being used as an act of war, discussing feminist peace movements through the ages when the terror of nuclear weapons has come roaring back as if it never went away, reflecting on the reality of feminist civic organising in authoritarian regimes, and how misogyny and racism act as organising principles for right-wing movements – these conversations have never been more devastating or necessary than this year. War tends to centre the masculine perspective. Women-and-children becomes a compound noun, an umbrella term for the vulnerable, the collateral, the peripheral. Then the event began – it was online of course. I could join it, but I couldn’t figure out how to become a speaker without kicking someone else off. Who to eject: the woman who’d mobilised 3 million feminists to join the dots between misogyny and racism, or the woman whose city was under heavy artillery fire from a man who would, the next day, bomb a maternity hospital? It was not a bad metaphor for the underlying sense that maybe my perspective, living this life where feminism contains no real risk besides arguing with other feminists, wasn’t the most relevant for 2022. So I sat it out in the audience, and the wonderful campaigner Alena Ivanova chaired instead. Refugees stream out of Ukraine, showing astonishing fortitude and endurance, and are met with equally awe-inspiring kindness by the citizens of the rest of Europe, who understand on a human level what geopolitics can’t bring itself to voice: that this could be any one of us. The UK has been unique in its response; finally, there’s some British exceptionalism one could actually stand behind. We are exceptionally bad at this. While other nations waive their visa requirements, ours are crazy: biometric tests that refugees can only take at specific centres; appointments nobody can get till April; visa centres that won’t open their doors, as queues of people wait outside in freezing temperatures; others that keep their location secret, lest they accidentally help anyone. This inhumanity will be a lasting stain on the nation, and it is, at this point, impossible to tell whether it’s deliberate, motivated by the home secretary’s reluctance to offer sanctuary to anyone, or accidental, driven by incompetence. In all likelihood, there will be some frantic governmental scrambling to save face. The stringency of the entry requirements is bound to be relaxed, as it slowly dawns on Priti Patel that, even if she were asking for the right documents, her government doesn’t have the capacity to check them. By that point, hundreds of thousands of desperate people will have been through needless hardship and turmoil and bureaucratic hell, to satisfy rules that were never necessary and have shamed us all. The Kardashians have signed a reported nine-figure deal with Hulu for their new reality show, because, in the words of Kris Jenner, “well, money always matters”. Perhaps it was one of terms of the deal, that they spark a controversy from day one, or maybe just because you don’t get to be nine-figure-famous without a certain facility for enraging people, but Kim Kardashian really pulled it out of the hat. “I have the best advice for women in business,” she said. “Get your fucking ass up and work. It seems like nobody wants to work these days.” There followed an outraged response on social media, including some from people who claimed to have worked for the Kardashians on such low wages that they’d occasionally had to call in sick, because they couldn’t afford the trip to the office. In fact, you hear this complaint a lot, even if you don’t happen to know any Instagram billionaires. Why don’t young people want to come back to the office? Why won’t they stay past 6pm? What happened to their work ethic? I’ve heard people analyse it in the wildest ways: it’s because their student debt overhang has completely upended their comprehension of money and value; or it’s because, what’s the point of saving, when you’ll never be able to afford a house?; or it’s because they’re all polyamorous now, and – absent the ups and downs of a stable relationship – they’ve never learned what it means to have to do something you don’t want to do. The Kardashian row indicated to me that maybe it’s a little bit simpler. If you serially underpay people, that doesn’t seem to motivate them very much. But maybe I’m wrong. Oscar nominees have a lunch ahead of the ceremony, who knows why, perhaps to practise their gracious-in-defeat faces. It’s actually not a bad idea, to sit next to the rival you hate the most and smile beatifically at them, just to get everyone used to it. If you, lowly punter, should ever feel at all envious of their charmed lives, I suggest you take a look at the menu: chickpea panisse with quinoa salad and pine nut picada. If you’re wondering what a panisse is, think of a chip, then make it of something other than a potato, and there you have it. A picada, meanwhile, is an aromatic sauce. Naturally, you’ll have heard of a sauce made of pine nuts before – pesto, of course, which is not really healthier than ketchup, but much greener, so more middle-class. Although history doesn’t relate the colour of the picada, we can safely assume that this lunch was basically ketchup and chips, with some quinoa on the side, functioning as a modern take on the lettuce in a burger, which is to say, the limp item that nobody eats. You have to feel for the modern Hollywood star; back in the day, the women were expected to be rake thin and were constantly eating watermelon, while the men sometimes had to be beefy, but could generally look however they liked (moreover, whatever age they liked). Now, none of them can admit to being on a diet, which would feel very 20th century, but nor can they admit to liking any unfashionable food, which is to say, all food. Yet whatever it is, it has to look like a luxury item, in order to generate the necessary wonderment from a watching crowd. So some poor schmuck ends up having to fashion a chip-a-like from a chickpea.

3/11/2022,"Brentford emphatically ended their slump last time out with a strong win over Brentford. Was it mere coincidence they scored more than one goal in a game for the first time in 10 matches with Chrsitian Eriksen in midfield? We more than likely will find out against fellow relegation contenders Burnley. If any match is likely to need some creative magic to unlock a defence it is when facing Sean Dyche’s obdurate side. The incentive for victory is huge, Brentford could open a relatively whopping nine-point gap over the relegation zone with three points. The spoils are equally tantalising, of course, for Burnley. Wout Weghorst has shown promise in attack for Dyche and if he lays down a marker then his side could jump out of trouble if Leeds or Everton lose.

3/11/2022,"A triple murderer who raped and strangled one of his victims has been sentenced to a whole-life order, meaning he will remain in prison for the rest of his life. Anthony Russell, 39, pleaded guilty to the murders of Julie Williams, 58, her son David Williams, 31, and Nicole McGregor, 31, during a seven-day “campaign of crime” in October 2020. After a trial at Warwick crown court, he was also found guilty of raping McGregor, who was 18 weeks pregnant. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Wall said guidelines on whole-life orders required that the sentence should be reserved for “exceptionally serious” cases in which they were required as just punishment. The judge told Russell in his absence: “None of these crimes was random or motiveless. I have no doubt that this is a case which falls fairly and squarely within the description of being exceptionally serious. There were three murders – each was separated in time and location. Each was the result of a separate murderous act which was sustained and brutal. Each involved the use of very significant violence.” Saying Russell was exceptionally dangerous and manipulative, the judge added: “This is one of those cases deserving of a whole life order. You will remain in custody for the rest or your life and will never be eligible to apply to the Parole Board for your release.” Earlier the court had heard how Julie Williams reported her son missing on 23 October 2020, before she was reported missing by her sister two days later. Police found her body with 113 injuries after forcing their way into her home in Coventry. After raiding Russell’s home on the same street later that day, they found David Williams’ body hidden under his bed. Russell fled the city with money and a mobile phone he had robbed from a 78-year-old man the day before, triggering a nationwide search. He travelled to Kenilworth, where he robbed a 71-year-old woman of £200, dragging her along the ground during the attack. He went on to Leamington Spa where he raped and killed McGregor a few hours after arriving. She was found in dense woodland days later, with wood and twigs in her mouth, and having suffered blunt force injuries to her head and face and a bleed to the brain. Russell went on to attack a 75-year-old man and steal his car before he was found and arrested in Staffordshire two days later. Det Supt Shaun Edwards, the head of the West Midlands police homicide team, said: “This was a violent series of killings which happened over a period of just seven days, but which have left two families devastated for the rest of their lives.” Police believe David Williams was killed because of Russell’s mistaken belief that he was in a relationship with his girlfriend. They suspect he subsequently confessed to the killing to Julie Williams and then killed her to prevent her from going to the police. “There’s no known link between Russell and Nicole, and it appears to be pure chance that he has encountered her,” Edwards said. Zoe Johnson QC, prosecuting, said Russell’s motivation for killing McGregor was to stop her from reporting the rape. “Every other violent crime committed by the defendant was for a reason,” she said. “We suggest this incident was no different. His crimes were deliberate and calculated.” “The huge effort that went into tracking Russell down, including national media appeals, can’t be overstated,” Edwards said. “We worked around the clock to bring him to justice.”",News/UK news,Triple murderer Anthony Russell sentenced to whole-life order,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/11/triple-murderer-anthony-russell-sentence-whole-life-order
3/11/2022,"Anastasia, also known as Nastya, was killed in Shybene, a village about 40 miles north of Kyiv, on 28 February. The soldiers refused to allow her mother, Luba, to go to the cemetery so she was buried in the yard, her cousin Anya Stoluk, 18, told the Times. Anya’s mother, Vera Dmitrienko, told the paper that drunk Russian soldiers had started shooting after a Ukrainian teenage boy found a gun and fired it in the air: “They shot into Nastya’s house, she was there with her uncle, and she died immediately. Her uncle was taken to hospital and we still don’t have any information from him.” A 43-year-old woman and her two children were killed by Russian forces as they fled the city of Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv. Serhiy Perebyynis shared images of his wife and their daughter, nine, and son, 18, on Facebook and wrote that the Russians “took them all”. He added: “Tanya couldn’t make it. I’m on my way, I must see you one last time. Forgive me, I didn’t cover you.” Tatiana was described as an adored colleague by staff at SE Ranking, where she worked as the accounts department manager, the Telegraph reported. It has been reported that the mother and two children were the three people photographed lying dead on a roadside after Russian artillery began shelling Irpin on 6 March. Five-year-old Semyon died in hospital last week, days after the death of his older sister Polina, the first identified child victim of the war. The boy was travelling in a car with his family trying to escape Kyiv on Saturday 26 February when Russian troops shot them all. Polina, 10, and their parents, Anton Kudrin and Svetlana Zapadynskaya, died instantly. He was taken to Okhmatdyt children’s hospital but died from his injuries on Wednesday 3 March, a family friend told the Daily Telegraph. His 13-year-old sister Sofia remained in a critical condition in another hospital, unaware that her entire family had died, the paper reported. Arseniy Kalabin, 14, died after being hit in the head by a piece of shrapnel as Russian forces shelled the town of Kukhari on 25 February, the second day of the invasion. After the war broke out, his parents, Tanya and Vitaliy, had sent him to live with relatives in the village, 50 miles from Kyiv, hoping he would be safer there, the Times reported. An ambulance came to the village to try to take him to hospital but was turned away. He died from his injuries two hours later. His aunt Marina, 39, a paediatric anaesthetist, travelled from Kyiv to retrieve his body, according to the paper. But as she was driving home with the boy’s parents, she was killed when Russian troops attacked her car. Relatives have not been able to recover her body. But Tanya and Vitaliy Kalabin returned to Kukhari, now occupied by the Russians, and buried their son there. Yuriy Prilipko, 61, the mayor of the town of Hostomel, north-west of Kyiv, was called a hero after he was shot dead by Russian forces. He had been helping his fellow villagers by handing out bread and medicine, MailOnline reported. Hostomel’s town council paid tribute to him in a post on social media. It said: “He never refused help to anyone. No one forced him to go under the bullets of the occupiers. He could, like hundreds of others, sit in the cellar. And he made his choice. He died for the community, he died for Hostomel, he died as a hero.”",News/World news,"Children, a mayor, an anaesthetist: civilians killed in the Russian invasion of Ukraine",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/civilians-killed-in-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine
3/11/2022,"Thomas Tuchel has responded favourably to a suggestion that the front of Chelsea’s shirts could carry “a message for peace” after Three suspended its sponsorship. The manager also admitted players were concerned about what could happen at the club and in some cases may be frightened. Tuchel was talking after Roman Abramovich was hit with UK government sanctions, plunging Chelsea into limbo. A swift impact was Three’s withdrawal of support until further notice. The government said it had clear evidence that Abramovich was connected to the Vladimir Putin regime and, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Tuchel would be happy to see Chelsea’s shirts carry a message for peace. “You can always wear a message for peace and it can never be the wrong message,” he said, before adopting a more lighthearted tone. “Of course maybe the worry is to find enough shirts that we can play with the sanctions! But as long as we have enough shirts and as long as the bus is full of fuel we will arrive and we will be competitive. This is what everybody can be sure of and what we demand of ourselves. When it’s a big storm you dig in and you are all together.” Chelsea won at Norwich on Thursday and play again on Sunday, at home to Newcastle. Tuchel acknowledged the emotions in the dressing room when asked whether continuing to win would be the best way for the players to insulate themselves from off-pitch issues. “It’s always the best way, to carry on winning,” he said. “It’s maybe a bit more difficult because of the noise. Some players will feel uncertainty, some will maybe be a bit frightened, some will be concerned. It’s normal and it’s also not only about the players. We have a lot of people in the staff and the club who are also maybe also worried and scared and uncertain.” Billionaires interested in buying Chelsea have been told to approach the UK government with potential takeover proposals. Tuchel said he did not think the club’s future was under immediate threat. “I trust in everybody who is in charge [at Chelsea] and I trust the people in charge for the government to find a solution that keeps us going through the season and of course gives us the possibility to be in charge of our action in the summer,” he said. With Newcastle under Saudi Arabian control it was put to Tuchel that neutrals may want neither team to win at Stamford Bridge. “Maybe, but I don’t care,” he said. “I want us to win.”",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel open to ‘message for peace’ on front of Chelsea shirts,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/thomas-tuchel-chelsea-message-for-peace-players-concerned-roman-abramovich-sanctions-
3/11/2022,"How would you feel about having the most intimate and dramatic moments of your life put on stage? Would audiences think that this partly fictionalised account was all true? With that weighing heavy on my head and heart, I went to see the opening night of the play Bloody Difficult Women, whose title referred to Theresa May and myself. It was the oddest mix of emotions. The apprehension I felt was almost akin to awaiting a supreme court verdict. The play was not what I was expecting, and makes the point that May and I have certain things in common. We are both details people, we work hard, our lives have been shaped by difficult experiences, and we have had to make our way in male-dominated worlds: for me, the City and activism; for her, politics. It also highlighted another similarity: we both recognise that while sticks and stones can break our bones, words and abuse meant to destroy us rarely does. May, when informed about the play that focuses on my successful court case against her government – an action aimed at upholding the sovereignty of the UK parliament – was sanguine. She felt no need to demand to see playwright Tim Walker’s script, or to make any attempt to check it for factual accuracy or how she was portrayed. My attitude was precisely the same, and I think maybe that’s because women have a greater sense of themselves – we have grown accustomed to certain levels of criticism or abuse if we ever put our heads above the parapet. And we both understand the importance of freedom of expression. It struck me as profoundly ironic therefore that the only real-life character featured in the play to make a fuss about it should be Paul Dacre – who, as editor of the Daily Mail when I began my case in 2016, had his media group’s legal department fire off innumerable letters to its producers demanding to see the script. These were, quite rightly, declined. When I think of some of the appalling things Dacre published about me – even suggesting at one point that, like Joan of Arc, I should be burned at the stake – and the abuse they engendered, I realise this is a man who can dish it out but clearly can’t take it. Still, on the night I saw the play, I admit it was often very painful seeing my own life enacted on stage. Tim has been a friend of mine for many years – and still is – but I know that as a writer his need to create a dramatically compelling piece would, to some degree, outweigh concerns about my feelings. His play gets into intensely personal issues about my own life – as it does May’s – which I found very difficult to watch. Somehow seeing your life played out on a stage made the things that happened to me feel more real – especially as I am someone who has survived by refusing to stay down when others have knocked me down. The dramatisation also brought home to me how abhorrent the Daily Mail had been to dig into my family’s past to see if there were any skeletons. I appreciate a lot of my own backstory – as well as May’s – had to be condensed in a play that runs to only an hour and a half, but I regretted, for instance, that no mention was made of why my parents sent me to Great Britain from British Guyana when I was still a child. My father, the attorney general, had been fighting a dictator and corrupt government, which had made him powerful enemies and put my and my eldest brother’s lives in danger. On a lot of the smaller details, however – my love of cricket and crisps, for instance, and my husband Alan’s penchant for appalling jokes – the play is spot on. The real eye-opener for me about the play, however, was seeing the portrayal of Dacre in the Daily Mail office as my case got under way, and how I became, so far as he was concerned, an “enemy of the people”. In this regard, I know the playwright was writing from a position of knowledge – Tim worked for Dacre for 10 years, and present employees of the paper tell me he has captured the essence of the man. The play makes it clear that making my life a misery was all part of a game to him. After I saw the play, it took a while to process what I had just seen. Several people came up to me and said they had no idea quite what had been going on behind the scenes during my cases against May’s and later Boris Johnson’s governments. I had been for them simply this strong woman who had successfully taken two governments to court. I had a surreal encounter with Amara Karan – the very gifted and generous actor who portrays me in the play – and I was struck by how diligently she had done her research, and how we also had a lot in common. She had worked in the City – as I still do – before she switched careers and went into acting owing to the misogyny she too had encountered. She asked me if I was OK. I gave her a hug. Ultimately, I would never have wanted a play to be put on about me. I am not sure I would wish the ordeal on anyone. But I accept its heart is in the right place. For it is important in this week of International Women’s Day for society and its institutions to accept that women must not be bullied or intimidated. We have a rightful place in all walks of life, including in positions of power.
