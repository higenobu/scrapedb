3/2/2022,"The Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss has claimed he has been offered the chance to join a takeover bid for Chelsea as pressure grows on Roman Abramovich to sell the club. Abramovich’s future at Chelsea is in doubt after he announced plans to relinquish the running of the club and the Labour MP Chris Bryant claimed that the Russian was hastily selling UK properties to avoid potential financial sanctions. Abramovich’s decision to transfer the stewardship and care of Chelsea to the trustees of the club’s charitable foundation came after a call in parliament for him to face sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine. The move has increased the sense that the 55-year-old, who has vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin and Russia or that he has done anything to merit being sanctioned, could be ready to tempted to sell. Interested parties could look to move swiftly in case Abramovich is sanctioned by the UK government, at which point it is unlikely a sale would be permitted. Chelsea have maintained that they are not for sale, but bids could reach Abramovich this week and the sense of uncertainty has grown after Wyss said he had been asked to join a consortium of “six or seven investors” looking to buy the club. There is no suggestion that Abramovich is about to call in the £1.5bn worth of loans he has given Chelsea since buying them in 2003. However Wyss said that Abramovich wanted a sale, though the 86-year-old added that the current asking price was too high. “Abramovich is trying to sell all his villas in England, he also wants to get rid of Chelsea quickly,” Wyss told the Swiss newspaper Blick. “I and three other people received an offer on Tuesday to buy Chelsea from Abramovich. I have to wait four to five days now. Abramovich is currently asking far too much. You know, Chelsea owe him £2bn. But Chelsea has no money. As of today, we don’t know the exact selling price.” Wyss, worth a reported £4.3bn, said that he would not act alone. “I can well imagine starting at Chelsea with partners,” he said. “But I have to examine the general conditions first. But what I can already say: I’m definitely not doing something like this alone. If I buy Chelsea, then with a consortium consisting of six to seven investors.” Chelsea’s declined to comment on Wyss’s claims. Speculation is mounting that Abramovich’s time at Chelsea could be drawing to a close. The US businessman Todd Boehly and the Ineos chairman, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, have reportedly tried to buy the club in the past. Abramovich’s plan to transfer the stewardship of Chelsea to the foundation’s trustees has run into obstacles. Some trustees have concerns over Abramovich’s plan and the Charity Commission has contacted the foundation for more information after a serious incident report was reported to the regulatory body. The trustees are likely to want an impenetrable indemnity policy in place if they are to go ahead with the proposed change to the club’s structure. That would ensure they are not liable for any financial ramifications on their watch. Abramovich’s spokesperson was approached for comment on the claim he was seeking to sell some of his properties.",Sport/Football,Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss says he has been offered chance to buy Chelsea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/02/chelsea-swiss-billionaire-hansjorg-wyss-says-offered-chance-buy-club-roman-abramovich
3/2/2022,"Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, is pulling out of the European market, after it said it faced large outflows of cash in the region, as well as threats to the safety of its employees and branches. The bank said in a statement that its European subsidiaries had faced “abnormal cash outflows”, meaning it could no longer supply them with liquidity. However, Sberbank said it had sufficient capital to be able to make payments to all of its depositors. Sberbank has been operating in Germany, Austria, Croatia, and Hungary among other countries, and had European assets worth €13bn (£10.8bn) at the end of 2020. The lender’s announcement came only hours after the European Central Bank had ordered closure of its European arm, warning it could fail after a run on deposits amid a backlash resulting from the Russian president Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The UK, EU and US have been ramping up sanctions and taking unprecedented measures to squeeze Russia’s economy, including blocking Russia’s access to the Swift international banking payment system and restrictions on the Russian central bank. Sberbank was among the list of banks added to the UK and US sanctions lists after the invasion by Moscow, with the British government highlighting the Kremlin’s controlling share. The lender has played a significant role in financing Russian companies, including those listed on the London Stock Exchange. The government highlighted the Russian government’s controlling share and said it was a “highly significant entity”. Sanctions are beginning to bite in Russia, where the rouble has tumbled in value since trading began on Monday morning, prompting the central bank to double interest rates to 20%, and suspend trading on the Moscow stock exchange for the third day in a row. On Wednesday, Sberbank reported a record annual net profit for 2021 of 1.25tn roubles (£9.4bn), a jump of 64% compared with a year earlier. It is unlikely to reach such levels of earnings again in the near future, as it grapples with sanctions and after its departure from the European market.",News/Business,Russia’s Sberbank pulls out of Europe after facing failure amid sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/02/russia-sberbank-pulls-out-of-europe-after-facing-failure-amid-sanctions
3/2/2022,"“At the Super Bowl, there was a player on the field who was older than both head coaches (Andrew Whitworth, the Rams’ 40-year-old offensive tackle),” tweets Alex G. “Has this ever happened in a professional football match, excluding player-managers?” Chai from Atlanta starts us off with a popular answer: “Yokohama FC’s Kazuyoshi Miura (born in 1967) is in his 50s and was still going strong in Japan’s J2 League until last season. So it’s no wonder that when he made a brief appearance against Ehime FC on 24 November 2019, he was older than his coach, Takahiro Shimotaira (born in 1971) and the opposition’s Kenta Kawai (born in 1981). In Serie A, when Juventus’ ageless legend Gianluigi Buffon (born in 1978) played against Sassuolo on 12 May 2021, he was also older than both coaches, Andrea Pirlo and Roberto De Zerbi. Both of them were born in 1979.” Sam Tomlinson goes in deep on Our League, pointing out that nobody in the Premier League this season has qualified, but that in the Championship, Wayne Rooney and Russell Martin – the respective Derby and Swansea managers – and Poya Asbaghi, of Barnsley, are all younger than Rams player Curtis Davies, who has featured against the Swans and Tykes. In League One, Cambridge’s Wes Hoolahan, 40 in May, twice qualified this season, having been younger than Mark Bonner, his manager, and Kieran McKenna of Ipswich and Liam Manning of MK Dons … who is himself eight months younger than Dean Lewington, who has been the oldest participant in three matches. In League Two, Kevin Ellison of Newport, 43 last month, has qualified twice; he’s older than his own manager, James Rowberry, Joey Barton of Bristol Rovers and Ben Garner of Swindon. Ellison has done the same in the Carabao Cup and EFL Trophy, too. Chris Calladine steps in: “I found several examples from last season’s National League where Nathan Tyson of Chesterfield was the player in question. I also stumbled upon the 1978 Svenska Cupen final, in which Krister Kristensson of Malmö ( born 25 July 1942) was older than both his manager Bob Houghton ( 30 October 1947) and Kalmar’s Bo Johansson ( 28 November 1942).” David Ekstrand keeps us in Sweden. “One example is the game between Östersund and IFK Gothenburg in Sweden’s Allsvenskan, 15 April 2018,” he begins. “Tobias Hysén (son of former Liverpool player Glenn) started for IFK Gothenburg. Born in 1982, he was older than both the Östersund manager Ian Burchnall (born 1983; now at Notts County) and IFK Gothenburg manager Poya Asbaghi.” We go on. Here’s Richard Wilson: “The recently retired Martin Kamburov, born 13 October 1980, is the top scorer in the history of the Bulgarian league, having scored his 256th and final goal this season and setting a record that will likely never be broken. Last season, he spent his time at CSKA 1948, who were managed at the start of the season by Yordan Yurukov (born 2 October 1983). During that season, Kamburov would have played against sides managed by Stanislav Genchev (20 March 1981) and Kamburov’s former international teammate Aleksandar Tunchev (10 July 1981).” Daniel Bickermann wraps things up by informing us that “the only instance I found were the three meetings of Julian Nagelsmann (as Hoffenheim head coach, he was born in July 1987) and Domenico Tedesco (as Schalke coach, born in September 1985) in the 2017-18 and 2018-19 season. They fielded very young and exciting teams, so it’s remarkable that veteran defender Naldo (born 1982) was the only player, who featured in three games, who was older than both the coaches.” “Bristol City’s 2-1 win over Middlesbrough on 19 February 2022 was their 12th consecutive league game in which they have both scored and conceded. What’s the longest such streak any team has managed?” wonders Simon Orriss. Plus … “What is the longest run a team has had with both teams scoring and over 2.5 goals? Bristol City are currently on a run of 12 league games,” tweets Ashley Gower. Since the question, we’re up to 13, but Chris Roe has had a spectacular delve. “Not only in this not a record, it is entirely unremarkable as a sequence,” he starts. Ah, OK. “For English teams who have played at least 2,000 league matches, there are only 10 teams in total who have had a longest such sequence that is less than 12 matches (Stoke City, for example, had the joint-shortest longest sequence of 10 matches starting on 1 March 1890). There are many examples of teams having such sequences of longer than 20 matches, with the longest being Arsenal at 31 matches starting on 3 May 1930. “For the second question, we find that the six longest sequences are as below, with the longest being Bolton Wanderers’ first 19 league fixtures. “You could restrict things further to only include matches where both teams have scored at least two goals, and then the longest sequences drop to seven.” “Brockenhurst United have a cattle grid on the entrance to their stadium - are they the only ones?” tweets James Westbury. Paul Baker was quick to steer us in the direction of Cambridge United, whose Abbey Stadium is situated in the northern end of Coldham’s Common. Cattle grids were installed in 1999 and there is a fair chance you will cross them if walking to the ground from the city centre. There’s another nice picture towards the bottom of this BBC article from last year that shows grazing outside the ground. “Do retired players still buy pubs? Who was the last top-flight player to do so?” asked Matt Braithwaite in 2017. Modern wages are such that some players could afford to buy the entire Wetherspoon empire if they wanted. That hasn’t happened yet but it seems some players still believe in the old tradition of buying a pub. “Daniel Agger, formerly of Liverpool, bought and still owns the Center Pub in Hvidovre, Copenhagen,” noted Jonas von Freiesleben. Agger has retired now, but bought the pub during his playing days. Eoin Byrne pointed out that the Northern Ireland international Niall McGinn had done something similar. “He owns not one but two bar/restaurants in Belfast, one called Failte (the Irish for welcome) and one called 26 West,” wrote Eoin. “Excluding the obvious cases of second-choice goalkeepers, which outfield players have spent the most time on the bench?” asks Frankie Nevin. “The Carabao Cup final featured 22 penalties in the shootout, of which 21 were scored and one was missed,” notes Athena Blight. “Has there ever been a longer shootout where not a single penalty was saved?” What’s the longest period in a game without the ball going out of play? Throw in/corner “Has a goalkeeper ever received a red card for time-wasting?” wonders Bogdan Kotarlic. “What is the earliest date, or most games remaining, for all the relegated sides in a division to be known?” muses Ian Ferguson. @TheKnowledge_GU I make it about three minutes and forty seconds between Sebastian Haller’s own goal and his goal this evening.

3/2/2022,"Do we ever learn? Vladimir Putin joins a cast of monsters – from Saddam Hussein to Muammar Gaddafi – who were once blessed by western patronage. His regime was forged in the ruins of Grozny, and legitimised in the property portfolios of Highgate and Chelsea. Twenty-three years ago, the then largely unknown Putin surfed a national wave of jingoism to become Boris Yeltsin’s successor, after a series of supposed terrorist bombings in Russian apartment buildings provided a prete​​xt for the country’s second Chechen war. Never mind that there is compelling evidence that Russian security services carried out these bombings to provide a casus belli for the invasion, never mind that tens of thousands of Chechens were slaughtered amid horrendous war crimes: Putin was lauded and embraced. The former MI6 chief, Sir Richard Dearlove, expressed his regret in 2018 for our security services’ role in Putin’s rise to power, including the time Tony Blair was offered up to the Russians for a photo op in 2000. The following year the former prime minister also drew parallels between Chechnya and the west’s “war on terror”. Putin’s descent into unapologetic authoritarianism didn’t lead Blair to revise his opinions – instead, he urged the west to put aside its displeasure at the annexation of Crimea in 2014 to ally with Putin against “radical Islam”, a plea he repeated in 2018, just three months after the Salisbury poisonings. Today, complicity largely lies within the ranks of the Conservatives. The coffers of our governing party are flush with Putin-linked cash. According to a letter written by David Lammy and Rachel Reeves: “Donors who have made money from Russia or have alleged links to the Putin regime have given £1.93m to either the Conservative party or individual Conservative associations since Boris Johnson took power in July 2019.” Putin’s Russia has been one of several human rights-abusing recipients of British arms sales. When Nigel Farage – like so many of his rightwing populist brethren in the western world – declared his admiration for Putin, was he really so far outside the mainstream? An economic model forged by Thatcherism transformed London into one of the world’s premier tax havens and a hub for “dirty money” from Russia and other human rights abusers: no wonder so many oligarchs have snapped up real estate in London and the home counties. From football clubs to newspapers to tennis matches with our now prime minister, it’s no exaggeration to describe the Russian and British elites as profoundly entangled. This is why there is a need for an anti-war movement that unapologetically fights for a world that isn’t a playground for brutish great powers: in the here and now, that means focusing on Russian aggression. Despite some claims, there is no significant sympathy for Putin on the left; no widespread repetition of the bankrupt apologism for the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, which led the Daily Worker’s correspondent Peter Fryer to abandon the Communist party and denounce Stalinism as “Marxism with the heart cut out dehumanised, dried, frozen, petrified, rigid, barren”. It is true that anti-war protesters – whether in Britain or Russia – have most leverage over the actions of their own rulers, but they should back peaceful alternatives to military escalation, including sanctions and curbs on “dirty money” from aggressor states such as Russia or Saudi Arabia. Anti-war activists should not obfuscate: Putin’s war is unprovoked and no mitigating circumstances exist. That doesn’t mean failing to understand how we ended up here. We should understand why so many eastern Europeans see Nato as a necessary bulwark against Russia – which they understandably fear more than the west. We should also understand how Putin exploited Russians’ avoidable sense of humiliation after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and we should be able to dispute the human rights credentials of a Nato whose members include authoritarian Turkey as it wages war on the Kurds. In the nuclear age, the role of an anti-war movement is to emphasise alternatives to a military escalation that could, all too swiftly, lead to the annihilation of human civilisation: above all else, an international order based on shared rules, diplomacy and cooperation. That means consistency. David Miliband is right to condemn an invasion breaching the UN charter and killing civilians in breach of international law as a “return to dark ages”, but he should reflect on his own vote for an Iraq war in which hundreds of thousands of civilians perished, which was condemned by the then UN secretary general Kofi Annan as breaching that same charter. The flouting of international rules by great powers legitimises violent anarchy. The anti-war movement fights for a heart in a heartless world. It resists a racist narrative summed up by one US news correspondent – “This isn’t Iraq or Afghanistan … This is a relatively civilised, relatively European city” – by emphasising that the invasion of Ukraine matters because they’re a people under attack, not because they’re Europeans, and that this empathy must be applied more universally. It also calls for a universal application of rules: if we stand against one aggressor, we should stand against them all. Arguing for consistency on international issues is often condemned as “whataboutery”, but at its heart is the belief that all victims of injustice are of equal worth. If we understand Ukrainians’ right to resist occupation, we should extend that courtesy to Palestinians; if we are repelled by the slaughter of children in Ukraine, we should feel equally appalled by the Saudi carpet bombing of kids with western bombs; and we should equally condemn atrocities committed by other anti-western regimes, from the barrel bombs of Syria’s Assad to China’s oppression of the Uygher Muslims. As Putin wages his war of aggression, the need for an anti-war movement that is as consistent as it is courageous is more urgent than ever. In the here and now, it condemns a criminal war of aggression, champions Ukraine’s right to resist, and demands those same principles are universally applied. It will find itself friendless among those who seek to gain politically or financially from war, but it should seek alliances instead from the grassroots of each country. It may not be popular, for now at least, but it will be right.

3/2/2022,"Early last Thursday, overcome by the desire to do something, anything, however petty, to try to fight off that sense of desperate futility, I started sending out emails to the sports federations who had events scheduled in Russia this year asking if they were going to cancel them. There were already reports that Uefa was talking about moving the Champions League final, later that day the FIA announced it was cancelling the Russian GP, and Rugby Europe that it was calling off Russia’s upcoming match against Georgia. A lot of the Olympic sports, though, were moving a little more slowly. Fina, which was due to hold two international swimming championships in Russia in the next few months, said it was “closely monitoring the situation” but “at present, there are no plans to change the current competition schedule.” The FIVB, which was due to hold the men’s volleyball world championships in Russia in August, replied that its event was “progressing as planned” and that “the FIVB believes that sport should always remain separate from politics, we are closely monitoring the situation to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all participants at our events.” It is still hard to read those words without wondering exactly which channels they were watching that day. There was a lot of this public relations pabulum going about, there were euphemistic statements from the International Judo Federation, which said it was cancelling an event in Kazan because of “the current international situation”, and Fina, again, which said it was calling off a water polo match between Russia and Greece because of “the escalation of the conflict,” and the International Boxing Association, which said it was considering rescheduling a tournament in Russia without mentioning the reasons why at all. They were weasel words, instead of the plain ones needed: invasion, war, murder. Over the past, long, five days, this, at least, has started to change. The International Olympic Committee’s executive board has urged all international sports federations to relocate or cancel events currently planned in Russia or Belarus, and told them to exclude the athletes representing those countries too. It is a significant moment in Olympic history. The IOC’s creed that sports and politics don’t mix, repeated in that email from the FIVB, has finally been laid bare as the myth it is, and always has been. The IOC, the “Olympic family”, has been hiding behind this for years. The IOC president, Thomas Bach, repeated it just last month: “If we get in the middle of intentions and disputes and confrontations of political powers, then we are putting the Games at risk.” It has been a convenient myth. It has benefited them, and Vladimir Putin. It allowed him, in the memorable phrase of the German journalist Jens Weinrich, to lead the IOC around the ring by the nose for the past 15 years, ever since he turned up at the IOC session in Guatemala in 2007 and persuaded the delegates to award the 2014 Winter Olympics to a resort which at the time had only a single functioning ski lift. A year later Putin invaded Georgia during the Beijing Olympics, six years after that he invaded Crimea during the Sochi Olympics – a Games which, by that point, had turned into a $50bn grift. In between, he oversaw the largest state-sponsored doping program in history. The IOC responded to all this by awarding its “highest honour”, the Olympic Order award, to two of Putin’s apparatchiks, the deputy prime minister Dmitry Chernyshenko and the deputy chief of staff Dmitry Kozak. The IOC had already given Putin his own, in 2001. It has just announced that it is taking them all back, a move which, at this point, only highlights how stupid it was to give them in the first place. The IOC wasn’t the only governing body to do it. The IJF made him its honorary president, World Taekwondo gave him an honorary black belt, Fina awarded him the “Fina Order” in recognition of his contribution to “the fraternity between nations.” They have all been revoked or suspended, too. Chernyshenko says the decision to take back his award means the “IOC has opened a Pandora’s box”. He’s right. These are the first stitches in an elaborate web of connections between Putin’s regime and organised sport. Others will take longer to unpick. Like Bach’s own friendship with the oligarch Alisher Usmanov, who was awarded the IOC’s “Trophy of Olympic Values” after he bought the original Olympic charter and donated it to the Olympic museum. Just last year, Bach gave a statement praising his “friend” Usmanov on his re-election as president of the International Fencing Federation. He hasn’t yet said anything about the news that Usmanov has now had his assets frozen by the EU because of his “close ties to Putin”. On Tuesday morning this week, by the way, the FIVB finally did announce it was cancelling those world championships in Russia, and was banning Russian and Belarusian athletes from competition, too, “because of the war in Ukraine”. Fina has cancelled its world junior championships too, although it says it is going to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to continue to compete as neutral athletes, without national colours, anthems, or flags. The IOC has left its options open, too, it hasn’t yet expelled Russia, or Belarus, or banned them for the next Olympiad, an equivocation that hints at its lack of understanding, even now, of how the world has changed in the past few days.",Sport/Sport,The soft touches of sport slowly unpick elaborate web with Putin’s regime | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/02/sport-ioc-russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-life-death
3/2/2022,"Shirley Hughes, the author and illustrator whose everyday stories of early childhood cast a happy glow across generations of family life, has died aged 94, her family has said. Over a career that spanned 70 years, Hughes illustrated and wrote some 60 books, winning BookTrust’s inaugural lifetime achievement award in 2015, and being voted the most popular winner in the first 50 years of the Kate Greenaway medal for illustration for her picture book Dogger, which told the story of a little boy who is left distraught when his beloved toy dog turns up at a jumble sale. “At the core of Shirley’s work is a child’s feeling, a child’s emotions. She spent her whole life taking this as seriously as many take adult feelings and emotions. This is part of what made her so special and so important,” said former children’s laureate Michael Rosen. Philip Pullman called her “a rich and wide-ranging talent”. “She’s such a warm and benevolent presence in the lives of uncountable numbers of children, and the parents who loved her when they too were children, that it’s impossible to imagine how we ever did without her,” he added. Hughes brought an unrivalled compassion and humour to the emotional lives of the smallest children, whether they were mourning the loss of a beloved toy, or delighting in a new pair of yellow wellies (albeit on the wrong feet). Sibling relationships are a recurrent theme, not least in her well-loved Alfie books, which began in 1981 with the story of four-year-old Alfie accidentally locking himself in his house after a shopping trip with his mum and his little sister. “Annie Rose was hungry as well as tired. She began to cry. Then Alfie began to cry too … he didn’t like being all by himself on the wrong side of the door.” Hughes grew up in the Wirral, the youngest of three daughters born to bargain store magnate TJ Hughes, whose flagship shop towered above Liverpool’s London Road for 99 years until its closure in 2011. Her mother was a keen theatre-goer, who took full advantage of the city’s three playhouses, inspiring her daughter with such a love of stage design that she left the local grammar school at 16 to study costume at Liverpool School of Art. She went on to Oxford’s Ruskin School of Drawing, where a perceptive tutor suggested her real calling might be illustration. She always maintained that picture books were intrinsically theatrical. She started out as an illustrator for the books of other authors, getting her first major break when she was asked to take on a new series called My Naughty Little Sister, by an as-yet unknown writer, Dorothy Edwards. Published in 1952, it quickly became a classic – thanks in part to Hughes’s skill at capturing the body language of a grumpy little girl. She had already been personally sought out by Noel Streatfeild to illustrate a new novel, The Bell Family. By this time she had married the architect John Vulliamy and settled in a scruffy Notting Hill townhouse, with communal gardens at the back, where they would spend their married life. In 1960, as the mother of two small sons, she “plucked up the courage” to propose her own picture book, Lucy and Tom’s Day. Though her publishers feared it was “far too quintessentially English” to reach an international market, they went ahead, and were rewarded with her first solo series. The idea that she couldn’t command overseas sales was dispatched once and for all by Dogger, which was translated into 13 languages after its publication in 1977. Most of her books – not least her four Tales of Trotter Street, written for older children in the late 80s and early 90s – were set in the multicultural world she saw around her west London home. After her husband died in 2007, she turned to writing novels, publishing her first when she was 84. Both were set in the second world war – Hero on a Bicycle in occupied Florence, where she had spent time as a 19-year-old just after the war, and Whistling in the Dark, in Liverpool, which suffered a devastating blitz when she was the same age as the girl in the story. Her career came full circle in 2015, when she teamed up with her illustrator daughter, Clara Vulliamy, as the writer on a series of chapter books about a daredevil dog Dixie O’Day and his sidekick Percy. Pullman told the Guardian: “Shirley and the characters she’s drawn and written about are a great family of witnesses to the power of love and kindness. We could talk for hours – with a multitude of examples – of her mastery of the craft of illustration, of her close and unwavering observation of children as they’re busy with all the things that are so important to them, of her sheer technical genius. “But the best tribute to her lifetime of production is the physical state of the books of hers on bedside tables, or crammed into bookshelves, or face-down on the floor under the bed: battered, bent, torn here and there, perhaps chewed a little, scribbled on – these books have been loved almost to destruction. She will last as long as there are children.”",Arts/Books,"Shirley Hughes, children's author and illustrator, dies aged 94",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/02/shirley-hughes-childrens-author-and-illustrator-dies-aged-94
3/2/2022,"My wife died suddenly of a heart attack three months ago. I was unaware she had a Virgin Money credit card until a statement arrived the following month. I immediately wrote to the bank with a copy of her death certificate and asked it to freeze all transactions and provide a final settlement figure. After receiving no response, I phoned and, after negotiating layers of complex interactive voice recognition processes and a lengthy wait, I eventually got through to the bereavement team. It confirmed the account had been frozen and gave me an email address to send another copy of the death certificate. Subsequently, I received a further statement and a letter from Virgin Money, saying my wife was now two months in arrears and interest and a default charge had been applied. I emailed the bereavement service on the address I’d been given, only to get an auto-response that the mailbox is no longer monitored and to use a web form to notify the bank of a bereavement. Last month, I was sent a letter asking me to send the death certificate and proof I’m an executor, which I had already done twice. The lack of empathy on helping me settle my late wife’s estate is now causing me great distress. RD, Crossford, Fife The pain of having to battle an immutable corporation after such a loss is unimaginable, and Virgin Money’s incompetence is concerning. Two days after I weighed in, you were told that the erroneous charges had been removed and were informed of the balance. The bank acknowledged that, due to a series of errors, your original letter notifying it of your wife’s death had not been actioned, then the bereavement team failed to refund the erroneous charges and update the account status when you rang. It also admitted that its interactive voice recognition system on its customer service line requires updating. It has offered you £150 in goodwill to reflect the blunders. It says: “Due to an administrative error late payment charges were wrongly applied to the late customer’s credit card. We have since removed the charges and offered our apologies.” RS has also suffered obstacles in his attempts to wind up the estate of his late father and reckons that bereavement handling needs an overhaul: My two brothers and I are his executors. In order to apply for probate, we need to obtain details of the value of his estate, including the balances in his six bank accounts. Each bank has a different process for dealing with bereavement, some needlessly complicated. Top marks go to National Savings & Investments. I completed a simple form online and the balances were posted to me the next day. Bottom of the league is Marcus bank, which insists my brothers and I complete its seven-page bereavement instruction form, including irrelevant declarations about beneficiaries and indemnity, and signatures of all three executors. I said that all I required at this stage was the account balances, but my formal complaint was rejected. Surely banks should agree on a streamlined process for dealing with bereavement, and the regulator should step in and make sure the process is fit for purpose. The “one size fits all” approach of Marcus is simply not good enough. If the government agencies can get their act together by offering the streamlined “Tell Us Once” service (that lets you report a death to most government organisations in one go), why can’t the banks so the same? In fact, there is a financial equivalent to the Tell Us Once service, although banks don’t reliably flag this up. The Death Notification Service was launched in 2018 and allows a death to be communicated to relevant banks via a single online form. Banks then contact you regarding next steps. However, not all are signed up and the service wouldn’t have saved you from the varied form filling to obtain the account balances. Marcus, part of Goldman Sachs, told me its voluminous paperwork was necessary to verify identities and gather, in one go, the data required to release funds and close accounts when probate is granted. However, it immediately contacted you to provide the balance and offer £100 for your inconvenience, and it told you it would be looking to simplify its processes. It says: “We’re sorry for the difficulty experienced. We seek to make the bereavement process as simple and secure as possible and are a member of the Death Notification Service.
