2/17/2022,"Elon Musk reminded Joe Biden that Tesla's Model 3 was the most manufactured US car in the country. He tweeted a link to an article, which said Model 3 contributed the most to the US economy. Musk has criticized the president in the past for leaving Tesla out of the EV conversation. Elon Musk hit back at President Joe Biden on Wednesday, saying Tesla's Model 3 is the most manufactured American car in the country. The Tesla CEO was replying to Biden's tweet last week about making federal government vehicles electric, offering more manufacturing jobs, and building supply chains in the US. ""We're making ""buy American"" a reality — not just a promise,"" Biden tweeted. Musk responded twice to the president's tweet on Wednesday — first, he linked to a US Today article reporting that Tesla's Model 3 was the first electric vehicle to reach number one in Cars.com's 2021 American-Made Index (AMI), meaning it contributes the most to the US economy. Musk wrote in the tweet caption, ""[ahem]."" Five hours later, the billionaire tweeted in reply to Biden's tweet again, saying: ""Model 3 is literally the most made in America car in – well of course – America."" Musk has criticized Biden over the past few months for leaving out Tesla, while praising Ford and General Motors. The Tesla CEO has called the president ""a damp sock puppet in human form"" after Biden posted a video on Twitter, saying that GM and Ford were making more electric vehicles in the US than ever before without mentioning Tesla. ""Starts with a T, Ends with an A, ESL in the middle,"" Musk also tweeted in response to Biden's video. In early February, Biden said in a speech that Tesla was America's ""largest electric-vehicle manufacturer"" after facing calls to include the automaker in the national electric vehicle discussion.

2/17/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — Japan announced Thursday it will ease its tough COVID-19 border controls by increasing the number of people allowed to enter each day and reducing quarantine requirements following criticism that its current policy is unscientific and xenophobic. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the daily entry cap will be raised to 5,000, including Japanese citizens and foreign residents, from the current 3,500 beginning March 1. The decision is good news for foreign scholars, exchange students, business travelers and technical internship workers who have been unable to enter, but does not cover tourists. “It’s not realistic to ease the measures all at once,” Kishida said. He said Japan will study when it can start allowing in foreign tourists while gradually expanding entries of non-tourists. He did not give a timeline. He said quarantine requirements for entrants will be shortened to three days from the current seven, and those with proof of a negative COVID-19 test and a booster shot can skip self-isolation. Japan has banned nearly all non-resident foreign entrants since early in the pandemic. The country, which saw a significant decrease in infections in the fall, briefly announced an easing in November but quickly reversed that decision after the omicron variant emerged in other countries. Kishida said Japan will decide on a further easing of border controls based on a scientific assessment of the omicron variant, infection levels in and outside Japan and quarantine measures taken by other countries. Infection rates are stabilizing but not slowing fast enough, Kishida said. “Now is the most difficult time to cope. I seek cooperation from everyone for just a little longer so we can overcome this difficulty,” he said. Most of Japan is currently under virus-related restrictions. Infections only recently started to show signs of slowing, likely because of delayed booster shots. Nationwide, Japan reported 91,006 new cases on Wednesday, down slightly from a week earlier, after cases exceeded 100,000 on Feb. 5. But experts say the infections are continuing to burden Japan's medical systems, which tend to be overwhelmed easily because COVID-19 treatment is limited to public or major hospitals. Japan has become one of the world’s most difficult countries to enter and critics compare it to the “sakoku” locked country policy of xenophobic warlords who ruled Japan in the 17th to 19th centuries. The current border rules — scheduled to remain in place until the end of February — allow in only Japanese nationals and foreigners with residency permits. The policy has raised protests from foreign students and scholars, about 150,000 of whom have been affected. Japanese and foreign business groups have also protested to the government, saying the prolonged border closure has affected investment, business deals, product development and deliveries. Experts say the rules are hurting Japan’s national interest and delaying a recovery in Japan’s pandemic-hit economy. Many Japanese have been supportive of the tight border controls as they think troubles such as the pandemic come from outside the island nation. Kishida’s stringent controls are widely seen as politically motivated to gain public support for his governing party in upcoming July parliamentary elections. Kishida’s government, however, faces public criticism of the slow distribution of booster vaccines due to a delayed decision to reduce the interval between the first two shots and a third to six months from an initially planned eight. Kishida has set a target of 1 million doses a day by the end of February. Only about 12% of Japan’s population has received their third shots. Experts say the low vaccination rate contributes to a growing number of serious cases and deaths among elderly patients. While the fast-spreading omicron variant is less likely to cause serious cases among younger people, it is increasingly causing serious illness and deaths among the elderly by worsening their underlying illnesses, officials say.",World/Associated Press,Japan eases border controls amid criticism as exclusionist,https://news.yahoo.com/japan-ease-border-controls-amid-090557660.html
