3/29/2022,"A Ukrainian woman said she was repeatedly assaulted by Russian soldiers after they killed her husband. Her claims are being investigated by the Ukraine prosecutor-general, the first such investigation. ""This younger guy pulled gun to my head and said: 'I shot your husband because he's a Nazi.'"" she said. A Ukrainian woman who said she was repeatedly assaulted by Russian soldiers after they killed her husband is having her allegations investigated by Ukrainian officials, the first such investigation into a rape by Russian soldiers since the beginning of the invasion. ""I heard a single shot, the sounds of the gate opening and then the sound of footsteps in the house,"" an anonymous woman, who went by the pseudonym Natalya, told The Times. On March 9, two Russian soldiers who had earlier killed the family's dog while walking by her home near Shevchenkove, outside Kyiv, had returned to kill her husband, she said. ""I cried out, 'Where is my husband?' Then I looked outside and I saw him on the ground by the gate. This younger guy pulled gun to my head and said: 'I shot your husband because he's a Nazi.'"" Natalya told The Times she told her 4-year-old son to hide in the boiler room where they had been sheltering. The soldiers repeatedly raped her as her son cried in the next room. ""He said 'you'd better shut up or I'll get your child and show him his mother's brains spread around the house,'"" she told The Times. ""He told me to take my clothes off. Then they both raped me one after the other. They didn't care that my son was in the boiler room crying. They told me to go shut him up and come back. All the time they held the gun by my head and taunted me, saying 'how do you think she sucks it? Shall we kill her or keep her alive?'"" Her story is one of multiple reports of sexual violence and rape during the invasion of Ukraine and the first to be investigated by Ukraine's prosecutor general. Earlier this month, Ukrainian member of parliament Lesia Vasylenko spoke to UK officials about the rising reports of rape. ""We have reports of women being gang-raped. These women are usually the ones who are unable to get out. We are talking about senior citizens,"" The Guardian reported Vasylenko said. ""Most of these women have either been executed after the crime of rape or they have taken their own lives."" Natalya and her son have since fled, leaving the home her husband built for them and his body behind. She hasn't yet told her son that his father died. ""We cannot bury him, we can't get to the village, because the village is still occupied,"" she said. Even if the Brovary district is liberated, she does not know if she will return. ""Memories are hard,"" she told The Times. ""I don't know how I will live with all of it but I still understand that my husband built this house for us. I would never be able to bring myself to sell it.""

3/29/2022,"A woman in Shanghai, China, had her eyelid surgery stitches removed at the gate of her residential complex. Dr. Zhou Zhaoping said he was forced to perform the procedure this way as the building was under a COVID lockdown. Widescale COVID restrictions have been implemented in Shanghai amid a surge in local cases. A woman in Shanghai, China, had to have the cosmetic surgery stitches in her eyelids removed at the gate of her residential housing complex after the area she lives in was placed under a COVID-19 lockdown. A video of the unnamed woman undergoing the procedure has been making its rounds on Chinese social media, with the hashtag ""doctor removes double eyelid stitches through the fence"" receiving more than 140 million views on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform. Dr. Zhou Zhaoping, who attended to the woman, told Shanghai-based news outlet The Paper that he had ""no choice"" but to carry out the procedure in such a fashion. ""The stitches will be very hard to remove if we leave it for too long, and it could even cause scarring,"" he said. According to the outlet, the woman's cosmetic surgery was performed in mid-March, and she had the stitches removed last Saturday. She had undergone a double-eyelid surgery, which creates a crease in the eyelids to make one's eyes appear larger. Dr. Zhou initially suggested sending the woman a box of surgical tools so that she could get a neighbor to remove the stitches for her, per The Paper. However, she could not find any help so he decided to head down to do it himself. ""It wasn't easy to do it while standing because my hands would shake, so I asked her to keep her chin on the gate to stay still,"" he told the outlet. ""The security guard at the gate was watching us, but we both have negative COVID tests, and we both wore masks, so I figured the risk [of transmitting the virus] was low."" Dr. Zhou did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Shanghai, a financial hub with 26 million residents, has been split in two following a mass COVID-19 lockdown of the city that was implemented this week. Those living east of the Huangpu River have been barred from leaving their homes, while a five-day lockdown for those living west of the river will begin on Friday. Before the regulations, pockets of the city — including residential complexes — had already been placed under lockdown. The city recorded 4,381 asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and 96 symptomatic cases on Monday, per Reuters.
