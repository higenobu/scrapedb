12/10/2021,"The teams that came second and third in last season’s Championship –and now sit in the form table’s bottom four – meet in what looks a seriously important encounter. Brentford go into it without Ivan Toney, who has tested positive for Covid, and Sergi Canós, suspended after getting a fifth booking of the season for taking off his shirt when celebrating a goal against Leeds last weekend. Watford also have significant injuries, most notably to the winger Ismaïla Sarr, and after a run of encouraging performances in extremely difficult fixtures must seize the opportunity presented by their next few games to haul themselves away from the bottom three. As Claudio Ranieri said after they lost to Manchester City last weekend: “Our Premier League starts now, we have to get some points.” SB  Brentford v Watford, Friday 8pm (all times shown GMT) Manchester City have not kept a clean sheet in their past five games. Admittedly, four of those matches have ended in victories, with the only defeat in the midweek Champions League trip to Leipzig. City had already secured top spot in their group but only Zack Steffen’s saves stopped them from conceding many more on Tuesday. It is a sign something is not right in the City defence, which could also explain Kyle Walker’s frustrations and his subsequent red for lumping André Silva into the air. John Stones looked out of form, while Nathan Aké has struggled to earn a consistent run in the team. City have conceded only nine in the league, so the issues are not fatal for the table-toppers, but the run of failing to keep teams out will not do much for the morale of a regularly rotating defence. Shutting out low-scoring Wolves on Saturday would be a timely confidence booster. WU Manchester City v Wolves, Saturday 12.30pm Steven Gerrard returns to Anfield four games and three wins into his time in the Aston Villa dugout. A few interesting statistical themes have emerged from Gerrard’s games in charge: all are among the five Villa performances to feature the fewest lofted passes and fewest attempted long passes this season, and are among the six with the most completed short passes. Somewhat counterintuitively, despite playing fewer risky passes and more straightforward ones, Gerrard has presided over the four Villa matches in which they have had the lowest possession statistics. Still, results have been good, even if they had the good fortune to convert a combined xG of one into four goals against Brighton and Crystal Palace in Gerrard’s first two games. Liverpool’s fans are likely to be more welcoming than their team and, aside from the manager’s pride, Villa’s two games next week – at Norwich and at home to Burnley – are likely to be more significant. SB Liverpool v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm In their past five league games Chelsea have drawn at home to Burnley and Manchester United, lost to West Ham, beaten Leicester and, in Thomas Tuchel’s words, “stolen three points” from Watford. But they have also had a collective 91 shots to their opponents’ 35 (only the Hornets outshot them, by 13-8). Their recent poor run does not appear in danger of becoming a crisis, particularly with Romelu Lukaku returning to fitness. Leeds will be without their captain, the centre-back Liam Cooper, as well as Kalvin Phillips. Reports suggest the England midfielder may be out for two months, which is bad news given their fixture list. After the trip to Stamford Bridge, Chelsea play Manchester City, Arsenal, Liverpool and Aston Villa before the new year. Marcelo Bielsa’s side have lost nine of the 12 games Phillips has missed since Leeds were promoted in 2020. SB Chelsea v Leeds, Saturday 3pm Southampton head for the Emirates Stadium without three of their four most-used players this season. Mohammed Salisu and Oriol Romeu are suspended after both were booked in the draw with Brighton – the fourth time both players have been cautioned in the same game. Alex McCarthy apparently hid the extent of the hamstring injury that stopped him from saving Neal Maupay’s late equaliser at St Mary’s. “I had one [substitution] and we couldn’t take it because he didn’t say anything,” raged Ralph Hasenhüttl. “This for me is unacceptable.” With Fraser Forster also injured, Southampton have signed Willy Caballero on a short-term contract to cover in goal. Should he start on Saturday, this will be the eighth successive Premier League season in which the 40-year-old has appeared. Aside from 2016-17, when he enjoyed an extended spell as Manchester City’s first-choice keeper, he averages 2.7 appearances and one clean sheet per season. SB Arsenal v Southampton, Saturday 3pm After Kurt Zouma’s injury, which is set to keep him out for up to 12 weeks, David Moyes will need to fill the void left by a player who has been integral to the West Ham defence. The Hammers sit fourth in the Premier League and have a fine opportunity for another three points at Burnley but, with Zouma and Angelo Ogbonna absent, they could be vulnerable. The Clarets are struggling at the moment but Chris Wood certainly knows how to exploit defensive weakness. Craig Dawson and Issa Diop will likely start but if Moyes is to continue with three at the back, he must find a third central defender. Tomas Soucek could potentially drop back, with Mark Noble replacing him in midfield. Declan Rice is another option to play at centre-back but his manager will surely not want to move him from his usual position. Moyes must find a way to get through to January, when he can sign a replacement, and hope it does not cost West Ham in the meantime. WU Burnley v West Ham, Sunday 2pm Last weekend, for the first time under Dean Smith, Norwich played with a back three and a front two in an attempt to curb the threat of Tottenham’s Lucas Moura, Son Heung-min and Harry Kane without simultaneously curbing their own. The result was an xG of 1.6 – their joint highest of the season – and an xGa (expected goals against) of 1.7, which while not exactly outstanding is still the seventh best of their campaign, and more encouraging than the final score. “I felt three centre-backs would nullify them a bit and it did, but on the other side of it I wanted to play with two up top to give them some problems and I felt we did that,” Smith said after the 3-0 defeat. “I thought we adapted to the game plan really well.” This weekend he must decide whether to stick with it without Brandon Williams, on the pitch for all but 17 minutes of Smith’s tenure so far but unable to play against his parent club, Manchester United. SB Norwich v Manchester United, Saturday 5.30pm Newcastle have finally won a Premier League match this season, and momentum is often key when battling relegation. Conveniently, they are playing Leicester next. Brendan Rodgers’ side have struggled for consistency this season and crashed out of the Europa League on Thursday, so Eddie Howe will be optimistic that Newcastle can add to their points tally. Some Newcastle players might justifiably be distracted by someone different being linked every day to replacing them in the team. Those whose places are under threat will not want to be forced out the door, when there is a chance to stay part of a team potentially on the up. Howe’s current crop have a few more chances to prove their worth before the chequebook and exit door are opened in January. WU Leicester v Newcastle, Sunday 2pm Crystal Palace have lost their past three games by a single goal, a sign of falling short in the final third. In that period, they have managed only six shots on target. Christian Benteke, Wilfried Zaha and Conor Gallagher have four goals each this season but none are particularly prolific. Palace have failed to beat Everton in their last 13 league meetings. There is no shortage of attacking talent available to change that on Sunday – but Patrick Vieira’s players must start showing greater composure in front of goal. Benteke has missed eight big chances this season, on a par with only Sadio Mané in the Premier League – and Mané has scored seven goals. Liverpool can afford to waste opportunities, whereas Palace cannot. It may cost them severely if they rely on Benteke for too long. WU Crystal Palace v Everton, Sunday 4.30pm Tottenham’s Sunday fixture at Brighton has been postponed due to a Covid-19 outbreak in the Spurs camp which has ruled out a number of players and also heavily affected staff. The club have shut down their training ground and had already called off Thursday’s Europa League game against Rennes. In mid-October it was confirmed that 68% of Premier League players had received two vaccination jabs and 81% had received a first dose. These figures will have improved over the past two months but there will undoubtedly be a minority who are still unvaccinated among Premier League ranks. Although a Covid vaccine does not guarantee avoiding infection, research shows it reduces the risk of death or serious illness. To those players who are avoiding it for whatever misguided reason: get jabbed for yourself and others.

12/10/2021,"A jury has found the Empire actor Jussie Smollett guilty of faking a hate crime against himself to raise his celebrity profile. The Chicago jury, which deliberated for more than nine hours, found Smollett guilty of five charges of disorderly conduct. He was acquitted on a sixth count, of lying to a detective in mid-February, weeks after Smollett said he was attacked.  The charges against Smollett, who is Black and gay, had become a touchstone in America’s culture wars at the intersection of culture, racism, politics and celebrity. Many fellow stars initially rushed to support Smollett when he first made the accusations in January 2019 that he had been attacked by people that had shouted “This is Maga country,” a reference to Donald Trump’s trademark political slogan “Make American Great Again”. Smollett told police that he had been assaulted on a darkened street by two masked men. According to Smollett, his assailants put a noose around his neck and poured chemicals on him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs and expressing their support for Trump. But a month later police arrested Smollett himself, accusing the actor of paying two brothers $3,500 to stage the assault in a ploy to get public sympathy and boost his show-business profile. Prosecutors had described the evidence against Smollett as “overwhelming”, saying what he did in January 2019 caused Chicago police to unduly spend enormous amounts of time and resources. “Besides being against the law, it is just plain wrong to outright denigrate something as serious as real hate crime and then make sure it involved words and symbols that have such historical significance in our country,” special prosecutor Dan Webb told the jury in his closing arguments. The verdict came after a roughly one-week trial in which two brothers testified that Smollett recruited them to fake an attack on him near his home in downtown Chicago in January 2019. Smollett repeatedly denied the claims. The brothers, Abimbola Osundairo and Olabinjo Osundairo, said Smollett orchestrated the hoax, telling them to put a noose around his neck and rough him up in view of a surveillance camera, and that he said he wanted video of the hoax made public via social media. Abimbola Osundairo, who worked with Smollett on the Chicago set of Empire, and his brother also testified that Smollett paid them $3,500 for faking the attack. Smollett called the brothers “liars” and said their account was “100% false”. He testified over two days about being the victim of what he said was a hate crime, telling the jury “there was no hoax”. Smollett said he wrote the $3,500 check to Abimbola Osundairo for nutrition and training advice. Asked by his defense attorney if he gave Osundairo payment for some kind of hoax, Smollett replied: “Never.” Under cross-examination on Tuesday, Smollett said that a few days before the alleged attack, he picked up Abimbola Osundairo in his car to go work out and that Osundairo’s brother, Olabinjo, came along. Smollett denied the brothers’ earlier testimony that they drove around together – circling the area where the alleged attack occurred three times – as part of a “dry run” for the fake assault. Smollett said the money allegedly paid for the attack was in fact for meal and workout plans that Abimbola Osundairo was providing so the actor could be more toned for upcoming performances. The 29 January assault was reported to police, prompting a massive investigation that a lead detective said included some two-dozen officers and 3,000 staff hours. The investigation which included video from surveillance cameras, GPS and taxi and rideshare records led police to the Osundairo brothers, who told detectives Smollett had staged the alleged hate crime. Smollett’s defense attorneys argued that the brothers attacked the actor who is gay and Black because they were homophobic and didn’t like “who he was”. They also alleged the brothers made up the story about the attack being staged to get money from Smollett, and that they told him they wouldn’t testify against him if he paid them each $1m. Smollett’s sentencing will be scheduled for a later date. Disorderly conduct is a class 4 felony that carries a prison sentence of up to three years, but experts have said if convicted, Smollett would likely be placed on probation and ordered to perform community service. The damage to his personal and professional life may be more severe. Smollett lost his role on the TV program Empire after prosecutors said the alleged attack was a hoax, and he told jurors earlier this week that “I’ve lost my livelihood”.",News/US news,Jussie Smollett found guilty of faking hate crime against himself,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/09/jussie-smollett-found-guilty-faking-hate-crime-against-himself
12/10/2021,"Race is “an explosive subject”, says a theatre director to actors limbering up for a “coloured show” on Broadway. But Al Manners is hoping to make this subject less “antagonising” for a New York audience of 1955, whatever the cost to his black actors. So the rehearsal room becomes a battleground in Alice Childress’s play, as some submit to playing mammies, servants and lynched victims, while others – namely the veteran actor Wiletta (Tanya Moodie) – rises up to challenge Manners (Rory Keenan) after a lifetime of quiet compliance.  Childress’s play was staged off-Broadway in the same year it is set, just as America was tipping into the civil rights movement, and she captured the very live anger of her era, as it was being experienced. This backstage microcosm paints a picture of a nation still acclimatising to the push and pull of racial integration. Its four black characters, Wiletta, John (Daniel Adeosun), Millie (Naana Agyei-Ampadu) and Sheldon (Cyril Nri), are actors struggling to survive in an industry filled with overt racial prejudice, and they remind each other to smile, nod and act out the reductive roles assigned to them without complaint at the start. It is ironic, then, that real-life Broadway producers withdrew the play from its scheduled premiere in 1957 because the dramatist refused to make it more palatable for its producers. Under Nancy Medina’s dynamic direction in a preview performance of the show, the tension is still felt now, especially between Wiletta and the pompous Manners, who disguises his micro-aggressions towards her with shallow flattery and flirtation. In other moments, the friction feels a little diluted, and without quite enough of a sting, perhaps because of our distance from this time or maybe because the play demands a tricky braiding of anger and satire. This satire comes mainly through the play being rehearsed on Rajha Shakiry’s shabby, half-covered stage within a stage. That play is set in the deep south and fixes all the black actors to outrageously caricatured parts: Sheldon is a father who does nothing but whittle on a rocking chair; Millie is a servant in a cotton dress whose lines consists of short exclamations such as “Lord have mercy”; Wiletta is a mother who effectively sends her son to his lynching. Some satire is built around the white characters in the rehearsal room, especially the bright-eyed Yale graduate Judy (Emma Canning), who is quick to perform white guilt but reveals an offensive naivety – in one hectoring moment she tells fellow black actors to “never have limitations on your horizon”. Wiletta’s stand does not spark concession or guilt in Manners but a chilling rage. “People think it’s wonderful to be white,” he barks, with a list of all he has had to contend with in his career. The drama – and anger – builds promisingly but an explosive denouement never comes. The closing moments are instead rather too oblique. “Tomorrow is another day,” says Millie, and it sounds like a play on Scarlett O’Hara’s sentiment in Gone With the Wind. It is intriguing to watch a cast of actors who are themselves playing actors but it sometimes appears too flamboyant and actorly, their comic exaggerations undercutting rather than compounding the tension. The play’s quieter questions around representation are where its real power lies. There is a discussion about language and whether it is ever legitimate to speak a racial slur on stage – from the mouth of a racist character – or if its utterance is always gratuitous and offensive. There is an especially interesting argument between the actors about whether being compliant – an “Uncle Tom” as Wiletta calls it – is the only way to exist in the industry or to protest against its prejudices. Rather than presenting this as a simple binary argument, Childress’s script shows the personal cost of protest and also the financial necessity of “Tom-ing”. As Sheldon says, he needs this job to pay his bills and cannot afford to protest. And while typecasting in theatre may not be as glaring today, Childress’s themes do not feel nearly as distant as they should.

12/10/2021,"Ben Stokes went into the third day of the Gabba Test with England stating he was “fit to bowl, if required” after a knee problem suffered 24 hours earlier. The all-rounder’s first day of Test cricket in the field after a four-month break was chastening and underlined the physical and technical challenge posed by such little warm-up cricket before this Ashes series.  First came what proved a persistent battle with the front line when bowling his fast-medium, the all-rounder’s removal of David Warner for 17 with his fourth delivery of the morning scrubbed off for a no-ball as the Australian opener went on to set up his side’s dominant position with 94. But more troubling for England’s plans this series was the sight of Stokes pulling up and grimacing after chasing a ball to the boundary before lunch. The vice-captain did not bowl at all in the afternoon session and when he returned in the evening, looked down on pace and struggling following a challenging day. An England spokesperson at the Gabba confirmed before day three that Stokes had “jarred his left knee” and was being monitored, but was fit to bowl if required. Ollie Robinson, a separate concern after leaving the field before stumps on day two, was declared to have no issues. The Stokes no-ball issue made for a talking point on day two, with England frustrated by a lack of assistance from the on-field umpires following a breakdown in the technology that is meant to check the front line. Bowler error was clearly at play with the “dismissal” of Warner, although it soon transpired that Stokes had also overstepped for the three preceding deliveries. “Pathetic officiating,” said Ricky Ponting on commentary, reflecting the fact England’s vice-captain was unaware of an issue until it led to a wicket being scrubbed off. Front foot no-balls have been the domain of the third umpire since February last year, when, after a successful trial by the ICC, a four-camera set-up was introduced for Test cricket to take the burden away from the on-field officials. In the main the new set-up has worked well. It was not until the Warner “wicket” occurred, however, that it was learned the system is in fact missing from this first Test after breaking down upon arrival from the UK. The job of checking the front line has returned to the middle until the system is fixed, with Rod Tucker the umpire who missed these initial no-balls. Host broadcasters Channel 7 later showed that, in fact, 14 deliveries from Stokes’s initial five-over spell were similarly illegal because of overstepping, a problem not just for the bowler but costly for the batting side also. “What a fast bowler needs is some sort of understanding of where their feet are because obviously you can’t see your own feet,” said Jon Lewis, England’s bowling coach, after a day of toil for his charge. “It would have been nice for the first no-ball to be called for he could have made an adjustment. “So from then on he would have been behind the line because he knows where his feet are. That Stokes struggled with the issue all day – albeit with only two further no-balls called on the field – rather undermined this assertion from Lewis.",Sport/Sport,Ashes: Ben Stokes ‘fit to bowl if required’ on third day despite knee issue,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/09/frustrated-england-rue-stokes-no-ball-and-ashes-technology-breakdown-cricket
12/10/2021,"Late one evening, a large number of internet users are watching a live feed of a woman they know as “Aunty Val”. Sitting in an ordinary-looking British bedroom sporting a butterscotch wig, Deirdre Barlow glasses and a tight vest top that might give way at any second, Val gaily chastises her viewers for their lustfulness, while fondling a quiche. This is the, let’s face it, intriguing opening scene of the documentary How to Make It on OnlyFans (Channel 4). Val is the creation of former glamour model Alex Sim-Wise, who makes a living not just from performing specialist domestic erotica herself via OnlyFans, but from consultancy work helping others to maximise their income. For those pretending not to know, OnlyFans is a website that allows anyone to set up a paywalled profile and upload photos and videos, in exchange for a monthly fee from followers. Most content is sexually explicit.  OnlyFans is a marker of profound change, cultural and economic. While the gig economy has normalised hustling for small amounts of cash by doing discrete pieces of work, social media has encouraged turning one’s image into a sexed-up brand and measuring self-worth by the size of the audience: posing half-clad for a “thirst trap” and sending it to thousands of strangers would have been unthinkable 20 years ago, but is unremarkable now. New media channels such as Patreon and Substack have, along with podcasts and YouTube, made personal creative endeavours potentially lucrative, if the right niche can be found. OnlyFans is where all these trends converge. How to Make It on OnlyFans follows Sim-Wise, whose use of quiche is certainly niche, as she meets three OnlyFans creators who want advice on their own, more vanilla offerings. Most in need of guidance is Emily, who has rashly left her job in the hope of making more money online. Sim-Wise gives tips on creating more alluring photography, assisting in the purchase of a thigh-flashing wraparound dress and then physically moving elbows and knees into better positions as Emily, in her makeshift attic studio, attempts to stare into an iPhone in a way that will make randy punters cough up. Emily looks destined to be one of the 99% who don’t strike gold on OnlyFans, as opposed to the 1% everyone hears about, and her mentor worries that the threat of penury will pull her towards the darker corners of the site. “As soon as there’s a little bit of desperation, fans can sense that,” says Sim-Wise. “You’re more easily pushed into doing things you might not want to do, because you need that money to survive.” This is the obvious issue with OnlyFans: although it doesn’t have the physical dangers that require mitigating when sex work is done in person, the risk of being dehumanised for money remains. Another of Sim-Wise’s clients, Zoe – frank, funny and in possession of feet that, she thinks, could milk spare cash from online fetishists – is brought up short by a meeting with Reed Amber, a successful creator of foot-based content. Amber finds OnlyFans empowering, and perhaps the film could have used more people such as her, since they certainly exist. But she is still disgusted by the men in her inbox who, assuming ownership of her body, push for harder content and try to degrade her with abuse. Exactly how much of yourself you give to paying customers is tricky to regulate. A different angle on that comes from the third of Sim-Wise’s clients, Will, who purveys very explicit sex and, occasionally, non-sexualised photos of just his face. When Sim-Wise suggests subscribers might like more of the latter, a story spills out about the shame Will felt as a boy when he realised he was gay, and how he can expose his body but is wary of baring his soul. The psychology of inexperienced operators selling sex online is, however, not lingered on for too long, because the film wants to have a nudge-wink giggle over homespun smut. We get the latter when Zoe, researching her target market, logs on to a porn site and is soon sitting with her eyes out on stalks. “I’ve got a bloke rubbing his penis on her foot … he’s spitting all over it! Lube is a pound, mate!” Zoe decides to perform solo. Thus How to Make It on OnlyFans eases itself in alongside 2012’s hilarious but bittersweet My Phone Sex Secrets and 2013’s faintly macabre Dogging Tales, joining a sub-genre of C4 documentaries that try to peep with a chortle at horny suburbia. But whenever TV does that, it seems it can’t help lifting a lid on something disturbing.",Arts/Television & radio,How to Make It on OnlyFans review – a nudge-wink giggle over homespun smut,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/09/how-to-make-it-on-onlyfans-review-a-nudge-wink-giggle-over-homespun-smut
12/10/2021,"They were once so common, swarms of Australian bogong moths almost seemed to “block out the moon” at certain times of the year. Now, the bogong has been listed as endangered on the global red list of threatened species after crashes in its population in recent years.  The list, compiled by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, was updated overnight with 124 new entries for Australian wildlife. The addition of the bogong moth, famously seen in swarms at Parliament House in Canberra during its annual migration to the Australian alps, should be a wake-up call about declines in Australia’s invertebrates, the scientist Marissa Parrott said. Parrott is a reproductive biologist at Zoos Victoria and one of the researchers behind the moth tracker website that was launched two years ago to try to map the migration routes of bogong moths and learn more about changes in the species’ populations. Bogong moths were previously found in large numbers in parts of Queensland, New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria and South Australia. “It is a really big step for the beautiful bogong moth to be listed as endangered,” she said. “It is a really sad moment that a species that is so iconic to Australia, that people remember from their childhood as blocking out the moon, has now collapsed to the point of being listed as endangered.” Other Australian species to be added to the red list include several other invertebrates, as well as plants and mammals. Among them are Kangaroo Island species that suffered losses in the 2019-20 fires, such as the Kangaroo Island assassin spider, which has been listed as critically endangered, and the Kangaroo Island marauding katydid, listed as endangered. The grey-headed flying fox, listed as vulnerable under Australian laws, has been given a vulnerable listing and the Arcadia velvet gecko, found in Queensland, has been listed as critically endangered. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Scientists have detected steady declines in numbers of bogong moths since the 1980s. But in 2017 and 2018 that crashed to numbers so low the species was described as “undetectable” in the alpine regions where it used to arrive in spring in numbers as high as 4.4 billion. The moths are so important as a food source to animals such as the mountain pygmy possum that when they arrive in the mountains they are the second largest energy source after the sun. Researchers working with Gunaikurnai Land and Waters Corporation have also highlighted the species’ importance as a food source to traditional owners, with the discovery of microscopic remains of a bogong moth on a 2,000-year-old stone tool in a cave in Victoria’s alps. The ecologist, Ken Green, has been monitoring bogong moths for 40 years. He and other researchers were consulted by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature as part of the assessment and asked if they could quantify the size of the declines. “They said are we talking 60%? Or 40%? And we said no. Three years ago we had a decline of about 99.5%.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Green recalls one set of surveys in the Canberra and Kosciuszko region in 2017 and viewing one cave that would typically house 17,000 moths a square metre. He said they could see just three moths inside. Factors including pesticides and urban light pollution have been considered in relation to the decline in the species. Green said Australia’s drought through 2017, 2018 and 2019 was likely the largest contributor. He said last summer recorded a slight improvement in populations but numbers were, at best, 5% of what they used to be. Jesse Wallace is a researcher at the Australian National University writing his PhD on the bogong moth. He has been studying their migration patterns for more than four years to try to learn how the species navigates to the same locations each year. He remembers the first surveys he did in 2017 at breeding sites in NSW where in previous seasons hundreds of moths would have been caught every night. He said the endangered listing was both sad and unsurprising. “I caught about 50 in five weeks. That was the first indication that there was a problem,” he said. Jess Abrahams, the Australian Conservation Foundation’s nature campaigner, said the collapse of bogong moth numbers was affecting other species that rely on the moths for food. “The bogong moth’s population crash – and its cascading impact on other species – should concern every Australian, as we all depend on the interconnected web of nature, which gives us drinkable water, pollinated crops and clean air,” he said. He added the State of the Environment report, published every five years by the federal government, was due to be released soon and was expected to reveal further declines in the health of plants, animals and ecosystems across Australia. Parrott said sightings of bogong moths could still be recorded at the moth tracker website and people could help the species on its journey by keeping outdoor lighting to a minimum. She said so far this year the website had recorded 150 sightings but only one swarm. “It really should be a wake-up call that we need to help our invertebrates,” she said.",News/Australia news,‘Really sad moment’: bogong moth among 124 Australian additions to endangered species list,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/10/really-sad-moment-iconic-bogong-moth-among-124-australian-additions-to-endangered-species-list
12/10/2021,"Gladys Berejiklian says she is bound for the private sector and will not contest the federal seat of Warringah at the coming election, despite the urgings of Scott Morrison. The former New South Wales told Sydney’s 2GB radio on Friday morning she didn’t have any appetite to contest the seat but had considered taking on the independent Zali Steggall out of “respect” for the prime minister “and so many other colleagues who really asked me to consider this”.  “It’s not something that I want to do,” Berejiklian said. She had no appetite to contest Warringah “or any other federal seat, for that matter”, she said, and was looking forward to stepping out of the limelight: “I’m going in a different direction and I’m looking forward to the opportunities that next year brings.” Berejiklian said she had considered running in response to appeals from her federal colleagues but only “for a very short period of time, and then obviously [I] let them know that it’s not something I want to pursue”. “I want my life to change,” she said. She resigned as premier in September after the Independent Commission Against Corruption revealed it was investigating whether or not she broke the law by failing to report a reasonable suspicion of corruption on the part of her ex-lover, the former Wagga Wagga MP Daryl Maguire. Despite being caught up in an Icac investigation, federal Liberals were of the view Berejiklian would have a chance of unseating Steggall, the high-profile independent who defeated the former prime minister Tony Abbott in 2019. A Guardian Essential poll published on Tuesday found NSW voters remained sympathetic to the former premier. Berejiklian faced an Icac grilling in November. She has denied any wrongdoing. People close to the former premier say she never had any real interest in running in Warringah. Berejiklian and Morrison are not close. Guardian Australia revealed the approach to Berejiklian in October. Having mounted a public campaign to persuade her to run, Morrison changed tempo this week, telling reporters she had “suffered terribly” as a result of the Icac hearing and may choose not to run. After Berejiklian confirmed that on Friday, the prime minister said she had been “a dear friend over a long period of time”. “She’s made a decision to go forward into a new chapter of her life and Jenny and I wish her all the best with that,” Morrison said. “She’s been a great friend to Jen and I as we’ve worked together to combat the pandemic.” Morrison said the Liberal party had “great female candidates” for the coming federal election and contended that Berejiklian had “blazed a trail”. Professional women had been inspired to come forward for public life as a consequence of “Gladys’s achievements”, he said. He added that Berejiklian was “off to blaze a new trail now”. “I know she will continue to provide tremendously strong support to me and my team,” Morrison said. The Liberal party is worried about a voter backlash in its metropolitan heartland.

12/10/2021,"Joe Biden has phoned the leaders of Ukraine and nine eastern European Nato states promising support if Russia attacks Ukraine and pledging to involve them in decisions about the region. After a 90-minute call with Biden late on Thursday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Twitter that the two “discussed possible formats for resolving the conflict” in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have carved out a self-declared state.  After Zelenskiy, Biden spent 40 minutes talking to the leaders of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia – all of which, unlike Ukraine, joined Nato in the wake of the 1991 Soviet collapse. Biden reassured the leaders that nothing would be agreed with Russia about the region behind the backs of its countries, an adviser to Lithuania’s president told reporters. “Biden said, ‘nothing about you without you’”, said Asta Skaisgiryte. The calls came amid mounting tensions over a Russian military buildup on Ukraine’s borders – and unease among east-European states over US plans to hold talks with Moscow. Officials in Poland and other eastern and central Nato countries have privately bristled at Biden’s description of seeking an “accommodation” with Russia, worrying that any trade-off could increase the danger they face from an expansionist Russia. “Russia must not be given any say in how Nato organises the defence of its territory” or in who can join the military alliance, said the Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, in public remarks on Thursday. “What is most alarming is Russia’s desire to turn Europe into spheres of influence. It is unacceptable and morally indefensible, and Russia must be made aware of that in clear terms.” Eastern Nato members are expected to demand a seat at the table before Biden reveals more details about the talks on Friday. “We have said many times that we must be included in anything that is discussed in our region; nothing should be discussed without us,” said Linas Linkevičius, a former foreign minister and defence minister of Lithuania. “The intentions of Russia are well-known, they were always trying to split, divide, marginalise, so that’s nothing new … we have to maintain unity and a principled decision, especially when we have this possible aggression against Ukraine.” Linkevičius, like others, noted that there was little public information about the talks available yet and said that many officials were probably waiting for more information from the Biden government before speaking publicly about them. A diplomat from a Baltic state said there was concern that the talks being announced as Russia maintains its military buildup on the border of Ukraine “looks like Putin getting what he wants”. One senior official from an eastern Nato state also told the Financial Times that any talk of compromise with Moscow “must be immediately cut at the root”. Russia has said it is expecting “discussion of strategic security on the continent”. Biden’s calls on Thursday night were the first direct conversations with the group since he held a two-hour video call with Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. During the virtual summit, he warned the Russian president about potential sanctions if he launched an offensive in Ukraine. Directly after that call, he spoke with Boris Johnson, Angela Merkel of Germany, Emmanuel Macron of France, and Mario Draghi of Italy. Biden has said the talks with Russia will include “at least four of our major Nato allies and Russia to discuss the future of Russia’s concerns relative to Nato writ large”. Michal Baranowski, the director of the German Marshall Fund’s Warsaw office, said that there had been support in Poland for Biden’s strong response to Russia’s military buildup in Ukraine, which has included threats of sanctions against Russia and vocal support for Ukraine’s sovereignty. The decision to announce the new Russia talks had caused “confusion” and “some anger” in Poland, he said, because it signalled a change of direction in the White House’s thinking. It would be “detrimental” if Poland, Romania, and other eastern flank countries were excluded from the talks, he said. “The reaction would be very negative and it would send a clear signal to Russia that, look: if you need to talk about European security, don’t worry about what those pesky central Europeans are thinking, you just have to talk with the big powers,” he said. Any movement toward limiting who could join Nato would recognise a Russian sphere of influence, he said, putting Poland and other eastern flank countries at greater risk. “Even if nothing comes out of this, even if they just sat down to just listen to the grievances of the Russians, let alone, God forbid, that there would be any sort of agreement, then people will be talking about Munich and Yalta,” he said, referring to past settlements with Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Linkevičius similarly said that Biden’s “transparency” in its response to the Russian buildup had been well regarded in Lithuania, and that it was important to maintain unity across Europe and Nato.",News/World news,Biden promises eastern Europeans support in event of Russian attack on Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/09/eastern-europe-urges-nato-unity-in-biden-talks-with-russia
12/10/2021,"The Australian government is at risk of coming to the US-trumpeted Summit for Democracy “empty handed” given its failure to put in place a promised anti-corruption commission, the opposition says. With the virtual summit entering its second day on Friday, tax transparency campaigners also called on the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to pledge to ban anonymous shell companies and create a public beneficial ownership register.  While a lot of the early media focus was on the Biden administration’s decision to invite Taiwan – a move that triggered protest and scorn from China – attention is now turning to the commitments the US is asking leaders to bring to the two-day event. The summit is meant to focus on three key themes: defending against authoritarianism; addressing and fighting corruption; and promoting respect for human rights. A spokesperson for the US embassy in Canberra said it anticipated all participants would “make ambitious – yet realistic and concrete – commitments toward the summit’s objectives”. The spokesperson said it was an opportunity for leaders “to speak to their countries’ experiences with and challenges to strengthening democracy”. “Individually and collectively, democracies must continually demonstrate that they can deliver for their people, and we expect the Summit for Democracy to serve as a rallying point to do just this.” Labor’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, said the US had called for leaders to bring specific commitments to fighting corruption, “but the Morrison-Joyce government will be coming to the table empty handed”. “It’s now three long years since Mr Morrison promised Australians a national anti-corruption commission and nothing has happened except an endless series of rorts and scandals,” Wong said. “To this day Mr Morrison has still not even brought a bill before the parliament. Instead, he’s spent the past week showing just how disingenuous he is, by attacking the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption.” Morrison argued this week that the former NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian had been treated shamefully and subjected to “a pile-on” amid an ongoing investigation by Icac. Morrison’s attacks, included labelling Icac a “kangaroo court”, have been denounced by legal experts. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning His government released an exposure draft for a proposed commonwealth integrity commission in 2020 but critics described it as a toothless tiger, partly because it would not conduct public hearings into allegations of corruption involving the public sector. Labor has called for a stronger model – a stance Morrison has cited in attempting to defend the government’s failure to present a bill to parliament. “Australia’s standing on tackling corruption has slipped on Mr Morrison’s watch,” Wong said. Australia scored 77 from a possible 100 for the third straight year in the Transparency International’s latest annual corruption perceptions index, a barometer of perceived corruption in 180 nations. Australia’s rating is the lowest since 2012, when a more accurate form of analysis began, and continues a long-term decline since that year. The score is better than the global average of 43, but remains below Asia-Pacific leaders New Zealand (88) and Singapore (85). New Zealand, tied with Denmark, led the world rankings. Morrison is due to address the summit on Friday about 10pm AEDT. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the event would allow “robust conversations” about countries’ commitment to democracy.

The US also vowed to encourage partner countries “to strengthen their anti-money laundering regimes to bring greater transparency to the international financial system”. Publish What You Pay, a coalition of non-government organisations, called on Morrison to “follow’s Biden’s lead and make curbing corruption a national priority”. “Corruption is a disease that eats away at democracies,” said Publish What You Pay’s Australia director, Clancy Moore. “An easy win for Morrison would be increasing transparency requirements for Australian company owners. In a strong blow to kleptocrats, cronies and crooks, Morrison could ban anonymous shell companies and create a public beneficial ownership register.” Publish What You Pay urged the Australian government to use its appearance at the summit to pledge to prevent corruption in critical mineral supply chains. The group said the government should also vow to improve the resources sector’s openness through the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. In 2016 the then resources minister Josh Frydenberg pledged to join other developed nations in implementing the EITI, which sees mining companies and governments publish details about taxes paid and received. The scheme, adopted by 55 nations, helps to prevent corruption and ensure tax accountability by providing information on the governance of oil, gas and mining revenues, from the point of extraction, through to payments to governments. Despite the 2016 promise, Australia has never implemented the EITI domestically, and the current minister, Keith Pitt, has said he is “concerned” about the scheme. The US has its own problems renewing faith in democratic institutions, after the 6 January insurrection and continued attempts by the former president Donald Trump to promote the lie that he won the 2020 presidential election. Numerous states have enacted sweeping new voting restrictions. The US embassy spokesperson said the summit participants would “learn from each other on what innovative and ambitious commitments can be made, recognising that no two participants or their respective commitments can be the same”. “The year in between the Summit events will be a ‘year of action’, during which we welcome countries, including the United States, to make concrete progress towards commitments announced during Summit One.”",News/Australia news,"Australia is coming to Biden’s democracy summit ‘empty handed’ on anti-corruption, Labor says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/10/australia-is-coming-to-bidens-democracy-summit-empty-handed-on-anti-corruption-labor-says
12/10/2021,"Donald Trump, the former US president, suffered a major defeat on Thursday when a federal appeals court ruled against his effort to block the release of documents related to the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. Trump is expected to appeal to the supreme court.  A select committee in the House of Representatives is investigating the events on and surrounding 6 January, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol in a bid to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden’s election win. Amid scenes of violence that shocked America and the world, five people eventually died and scores were injured. Trump and a clique of his close advisors have repeatedly engaged in legal action over the committee’s investigations, including refusing to cooperate with it. But in a 3-0 decision, the United States court of appeals for the District of Columbia said there was a “unique legislative need” for documents that the committee has requested but whose release Trump has sought to keep secret through executive privilege – a legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of some White House communications. The appeals court ruled an injunction that has prevented the National Archives from turning over the documents will expire in two weeks, or when the supreme court rules on an expected appeal from Trump, whichever is later. Trump sued the committee and the National Archives to stop the White House from allowing the release of documents related to the insurrection. Biden had waived Trump’s executive privilege claims as the current officeholder. Arguing for the committee, the US House lawyer Douglas Letter said the determination of a current president should outweigh predecessors in almost all circumstances and noted that both Biden and Congress were in agreement that the 6 January records should be turned over. The court agreed. In a 68-page ruling, Judge Patricia Ann Millett wrote: “On the record before us, former President Trump has provided no basis for this court to override President Biden’s judgment and the agreement and accommodations worked out between the political branches over these documents.” The opinion continued: “Both branches agree that there is a unique legislative need for these documents, and that they are directly relevant to the committee’s inquiry into an attack on the legislative branch and its constitutional role in the peaceful transfer of power.” Executive privilege for presidential communications is “a qualified one”, Millett added. “The president and the legislative branch have shown a national interest in and pressing need for the prompt disclosure of these documents.” The National Archives has said the records Trump wants to block include presidential diaries, visitor logs, speech drafts, handwritten notes “concerning the events of January 6” from the files of his former chief of staff Mark Meadows, and “a draft executive order on the topic of election integrity”. Such evidence could provide the House committee with crucial details of Trump’s actions and communications in the west wing over the hours that the insurrection unfolded. The mob was acting on his “big lie” that the 2020 election had been stolen from him. Democrats welcomed the court’s ruling as a victory for democracy. Gerry Connolly of Virginia told the MSNBC network: “It’s in the finest judicial tradition, upholding the rule of law and asserting that nobody is above the law. “It harkens back to the Pentagon Papers decision and the handing over of the White House tapes during the Nixon years in Watergate. These are critical kinds of judicial rulings that buttress democracy and democratic institutions and the rule of law. So I was very pleased to see today’s new ruling.” All three of the appeals court judges who heard the arguments were nominated by Democrats. Millett and Judge Robert Wilkins were nominated by Barack Obama. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is a Biden appointee seen as a contender for a supreme court seat should one open during the current administration. Trump is almost certain to appeal to the supreme court, where three of the nine justices were appointed during his presidency. The court would be asked to weigh the views of a former president versus those of the incumbent on the scope of executive privilege. The House committee said on Thursday it is moving toward holding Meadows in contempt of Congress after he failed to cooperate. It said it would hold a business meeting on Monday to vote on a report recommending the full House cite Meadows for contempt of Congress and refer him for federal prosecution. Liz Cheney, a Republican congresswoman and Trump critic who is vice chair of the committee, tweeted on Thursday: “The investigation is firing on all cylinders.” Trump also faces legal peril in New York, where attorney general Letitia James is seeking a deposition him early next year as part of her investigation into alleged fraud inside the Trump Organization.",News/US news,Court rules Trump cannot block release of documents to Capitol attack panel,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/09/donald-trump-capitol-attack-committee-documents
12/10/2021,"People should take a lateral flow test before going out Christmas shopping or to a festive party, the Welsh government has said. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, is also asking people to wear face coverings in pubs and restaurants except when they are eating or drinking.  Drakeford said he expected cases of the Omicron variant to rise “quickly and sharply”, though there have only been a handful in Wales so far. There will be no new restrictions in Wales when Drakeford announces the results of its regular three-weekly review on Friday. Many of the “plan B” measures the UK government is bringing in for England, such as wearing masks in indoor public places, are already in force in Wales. But the Welsh government has said it is “strongly advising” that people “flow before they go”. This means taking a lateral flow test before going out – for example to a Christmas party, shopping, visiting friends or family, to any crowded or busy place, or before travelling. If the test is positive, they should not go out but arrange for a PCR test and self-isolate, the government said. It is also strongly advising people to wear face coverings in pubs and restaurants when they aren’t eating or drinking. Everyone must already by law wear face coverings in most other indoor public places, including in cinemas and theatres. When Drakeford appears at a press conference in Cardiff on Friday, he is certain to be asked about reports that he argued this week for a lockdown between Christmas and new year during a call with Michael Gove and ministers from the other devolved nations. The Welsh Labour-led government has refused to comment on the claim. On Thursday Drakeford said: “The emergence of the Omicron variant is another worrying development. We are concerned about the speed it is moving and its potential to infect large numbers of people. “We are speeding up the rollout of boosters in response to the new variant. We’re increasing the number of clinics and extending opening hours. Every single vaccination is a small victory against the virus. This will be the best Christmas present you can give yourself and your family this year. “None of us wanted to hear about this new variant. After almost two years of the pandemic, we had all hoped that we could put coronavirus behind us this Christmas. But we have faced challenges many times during this pandemic. And we have learned from each one. We are not back at square one.” The Welsh health minister, Eluned Morgan, said on Tuesday that Omicron cases were expected to reach their peak by the end of January.",News/UK news,Wales asks people to ‘flow before you go’ to stop Omicron spread,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/09/wales-asks-people-to-flow-before-you-go-to-stop-omicron-spread
12/10/2021,"The likes of Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund and Sevilla will know better than to judge West Ham on the basis of this low-key defeat. There was nothing riding on this for David Moyes’s side, who had already reached the last 16, and there is no chance that they will think back to losing to Dinamo Zagreb when they resume their European adventure in March. This was a night for experimentation. West Ham gave opportunities to seven homegrown talents and Moyes could take heart from the fact that Dinamo, who are through to the Europa League’s play-off round, won only thanks to a wonder goal from Mislav Orsic.  “The young players did well and recovered after we lost an early goal,” Moyes said. “If at the start of the European campaign you’d have said we had European football after Christmas we’d have been really pleased. But we’ve won the group. Now we’re looking forward to the knockout part. West Ham are a big team. We’re a side people will be worried about.” Untouchable at the top of Group H, West Ham had the luxury of taking it easy before visiting Burnley on Sunday. Michail Antonio, Jarrod Bowen, Lukasz Fabianski, Tomas Soucek and Declan Rice were rested and the intrigue lay in whether a starting XI containing five youngsters would be capable of handling Dinamo, who needed a point to finish second and guarantee progression to the revamped knockout phase. The Croatian champions were not in a merciful mood. Only four minutes had passed when Orsic, whose hat-trick knocked Tottenham out of this competition last season, collected a throw on the left, moved inside and pondered what to do next. Nothing appeared to be on, but Orsic is a wonderful striker of the ball and when Andriy Yarmolenko backed off, that was the invitation the forward needed to unleash a vicious, wobbling drive beyond Alphonse Areola’s dive. The kids who made up West Ham’s back four had seen the difference between youth football and the real thing. Dinamo’s football was intricate and there were difficult moments for West Ham as the opening period wore on. Luka Ivanusec worked Areola from the edge of the area and Orsic almost stole in for a second when Aji Alese, a 20-year-old making his second start at centre-back, had a mix-up with Harrison Ashby, a highly promising 20-year-old right-back. To their credit, West Ham’s academy products stuck at it. Emmanuel Longelo, 20, had an excellent full debut at left-back. Jamal Baptiste, one of the most highly rated teenagers in England, brought the ball out confidently from centre-back on his first start. On the right, meanwhile, there was plenty of adventure from Ashby, who created West Ham’s best chance of the half when he crossed for Sonny Perkins to head over. Europa League The eight group winners – Lyon, Monaco, Spartak Moscow, Eintracht Frankfurt, Galatasaray, Red Star Belgrade, Bayer Leverkusen and West Ham – progress automatically as seeds to the last 16. The eight group runners-up – Rangers, Real Sociedad, Napoli, Olympiakos, Lazio, Braga, Real Betis and Dinamo Zagreb – go into two-legged play-off ties. In the play-offs, each team will play one of the third-placed Champions League sides – RB Leipzig, Porto, Dortmund, Sheriff, Barcelona, Atalanta, Sevilla or Zenit. The winners will progress to the last 16. Conference League The eight group winners – Lask, Gent, Roma, AZ, Feyenoord, Copenhagen, Rennes and Basel – progress to the last 16 as seeds. The eight group runners-up – Maccabi Tel-Aviv, Partizan Belgrade, Bodø/Glimt, Randers, Slavia Prague, PAOK, Qarabag and either Vitesse or Tottenham – go into the play-off round. There, they will each face one of the Europa League's third-placed teams – Sparta Prague, PSV, Leicester, Fenerbahce, Marseille, Midtjylland, Celtic or Rapid Vienna – over two legs for a last-16 place. Both play-off draws will be held on 13 December, with ties played on 17 and 24 February. The last-16 draws will follow on 25 February, with games played on 10 and 17 March. - Otherwise West Ham offered little in attack. It was not a surprise that they lacked a presence with Perkins leading the line on his full debut. To put it into context, the 17-year-old was 196 days old when Mark Noble made his debut for West Ham in a League Cup win over Southend at Upton Park on 24 August 2004. Noble, who walked back to his home in Canning Town that night, was in central midfield here, still going strong at 34. Next to the captain was Alex Kral, who is yet to make an impact since joining on loan from Spartak Moscow. This felt like a big opportunity for Kral, although it did not help his cause that he spent most of his time covering for Yarmolenko, who spent much of the contest infuriating his teammates with a series of bewildering decisions in the final third. Yarmolenko was booed off when he was substituted in the dying stages. West Ham had huffed and puffed during the second half, although there were some encouraging moments from Nikola Vlasic. The £30m Croatia international looked capable of making something happen. By the end, though, there was a sense of inevitability about the outcome. Dinamo, who almost doubled their lead when Orsic stung Areola’s palms, were comfortable. Moyes, who gave late debuts to Keenan Forson and Freddie Potts, whose father Steve, and older brother, Dan, both played for West Ham, was thinking about the future.",Sport/Football,Mislav Orsic gives Dinamo Zagreb victory over youthful West Ham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/09/west-ham-dinamo-zagreb-europa-league-match-report
12/10/2021,"Well before the verdict arrived in the British Horseracing Association’s case alleging bullying and harassment of Bryony Frost by her fellow jockey Robbie Dunne, the battle lines were already being drawn for the aftermath. These clearly placed many – and conceivably the overwhelming majority – of Frost’s weighing-room colleagues on one side, with the full support of retired champions including Richard Johnson, who gave evidence in Dunne’s defence, and Tony McCoy. McCoy issued a tweet in support of weighing-room valets on Tuesday, shortly after it emerged that three valets who also gave evidence had refused to work for Frost at Fontwell that afternoon. His colleagues on ITV Racing, Alice Plunkett and (former jockey) Luke Harvey had already pre-judged the decision on the channel’s Opening Show programme by repeatedly insisting it had “nothing to do with sexism”.  The full extent of the fury – or perhaps, more accurately, the denial – within the weighing room became apparent only on Thursday, however, when the Professional Jockeys Association responded to the panel’s finding that all charges against Dunne had been proved, and that a weighing-room culture of self-policing disputes “is deep-rooted and coercive, and in itself not conducive to the good health and development of modern-day race-riding.” The PJA’s statement was as wilfully incendiary as it was sullenly defensive. The BHA’s independent disciplinary panel had just found one of the PJA’s members guilty of a shameful seven-month campaign of bullying, harassment and intimidation against another of its members. This had included vile mental and physical abuse and, perhaps most disgracefully of all, “dangerous bullying” during races, with the potential to cause serious injury or worse, not only to Frost, but other horses and riders in those races. Those riders are PJA members too. And yet the PJA’s statement acknowledged only that Frost had “felt bullied” by Dunne, not that she had been bullied, as the panel decided. Regardless of the possibility of an appeal, at best this showed an astonishing lack of awareness of how its choice of words would be perceived. And that was just the start. The jockeys’ union states that it “does not accept” the panel’s findings “in relation to the culture within and collective behaviour of the jump jockeys weighing room. It is a grossly inaccurate and wholly unfair representation of the weighing-room and a conclusion we believe is at odds with the evidence presented.” The panel itself – which is independent of the BHA – is accused of bias, with a claim that it has a “long and striking track record” of “failure ever to criticise the BHA, its case management and its processes”. And the PJA is “appalled” that Louis Weston, the BHA’s representative, characterised the weighing room as “rancid” during the proceedings. This, remember, is Bryony Frost’s union too, and its statement could scarcely illustrate more clearly the mood and atmosphere that awaits Frost, the brave whistleblower who stood up to a vicious bully, when she returns to work at Doncaster on Friday. There is no doubt that the weighing room, and the jumps weighing room in particular, is a unique working environment. Danger is ever-present every time a rider heads out to the track, falls and injuries are commonplace. Deaths and life-changing injuries are rare, but also occasionally inevitable when riding half-tonne horses at speed over jumps. But its uniqueness does not put it above the law of the land, and as Brian Barker, the panel’s chair, said on Thursday, Dunne’s behaviour “would not be tolerated in any other walk of life or workplace”. There were desperately unfortunate procedural issues in the case, including several leaks of statements taken during the BHA’s investigation which added to the pressure on all concerned. But these did not detract from the panel’s ability to reach a fair, impartial decision on the basis of the evidence which was presented to them, and while several current and former riders offered support for Dunne’s version of events, it seems telling that, in addition to Frost’s “truthful, careful and compelling” testimony, it was the evidence of relative outsiders that weighed more heavily with the panel. Two riders who were close by when Dunne launched a long tirade of foul abuse at Frost after a race at Stratford in July gave witness statements to say that they heard “nothing out of the ordinary”. A fence attendant who was a little further away, however, was adamant, and very convincingly so, that he had heard something that was very much out of the ordinary. It was, he said, furious, aggressive and misogynistic language, and he added that, had he known of any “history” between the two riders, he would have reported the incident immediately. With the exception of Frost’s evidence, meanwhile, the most memorable and compelling statement from a witness was probably the response of Hannah Welch, a former amateur rider, when it was put to her that Dunne did not recall seeing her in tears after another of his post-race rebukes. Staring straight into the lens, she said: “That … is … incredible”, revealing the extent to which the scars of that moment, which she says led in part to her leaving the sport, remain raw. For the British Horseracing Authority, the task now is to make good on its statement, welcoming the panel’s decision, that it “sends a clear message that conduct of this nature cannot be tolerated in any working environment within our sport”. Its statement adds that “progress is being made on improving the facilities that our athletes use, in particular our female participants” – another issue that the PJA insists it has been raising for years – while “the sport will soon be putting in place a collaborative, cross-industry Code of Conduct”. How swiftly any of this can be put in place while the jockeys themselves are in a state of denial remains to be seen, however. Racing is a centuries-old sport that has survived and thrived in an ever-changing world by adapting to upheavals and changing attitudes in the society which supports it. Another adaptation, to embrace modern ideas of how a safe, and safeguarded, working environment should be, cannot come soon enough.",Sport/Sport,Jockeys’ union in denial over shameful bullying and abuse of Bryony Frost | Greg Wood,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/09/refusal-of-jockey-groups-to-accept-robbie-dunnes-abuse-of-bryony-frost-is-shameful
12/10/2021,"Barcelona are unstoppable, untouchable and simply irresistible. In 17 games they have scored 91 goals and conceded four, and they barely stepped out of second gear as they humbled Arsenal to cruise into the quarter-finals of the Champions League. The Arsenal midfielder Kim Little described the defeat as a “slap in the face” but an “incredibly helpful” test nonetheless. “It really allows you to see where the level is at, and where we need to aim for,” she said.  The Gunners have the tough task of rebuilding confidence before Sunday’s home game against Leicester and next Wednesday’s crucial final Champions League group game against Hoffenheim, which will determine who progresses alongside the Catalan club. “Football is also momentum,” said their manager, Jonas Eidevall, when asked how they will protect the morale of the group. “We have to take away the things we can learn and develop. At the same time we must not forget the things we’ve done really well so far this season … It will be extremely important for us to get back on track and to not let this define us. “Everyone understands what needs to be done but everybody has to live by it.” The mood among the home support before kick-off was less about whether Arsenal would challenge and more about the size of the margin between the two sides. Such is the dominance and superiority of the Spanish champions that simply not being humiliated becomes the primary goal and, terrifyingly, that is almost as hard to achieve as emerging victorious. There were some positives to take from the first half. Despite trudging back to the dressing room three goals down at the break, Arsenal did not start badly. They pressed slightly higher up the pitch than they had in the reverse fixture in Spain, which they lost 4-1, played with energy and managed to pull off a few smart breaks. Ada Hegerberg [pictured] scored after just 30 seconds as Lyon sealed qualification with a dominant 5-0 win at Benfica. The Norwegian's first European goal for Lyon since returning from injury was followed by another just before half time, after Wendie Renard and Griedge Mbock had put the visitors in control. Signe Bruun tapped in a fifth as Lyon stayed top of Group D. Lyon are two points above Bayern Munich, who booked their place in the last eight despite falling behind at Häcken. Stina Blackstenius fired the hosts in front, but Viviane Asseyi and Jovana Damnjanovic put Bayern 2-1 up at the break. The Serbian forward struck again from Klara Bühl's cross, before Linda Dallmann and Lineth Beerensteyn sealed a 5-1 win. In Group C, Hoffenheim held on to defeat HB Køge 2-1 and keep their hopes of progressing alive. Two first-half penalties from Nicole Billa turned the game around after the Danish side had taken a surprise lead through Kyra Carusa. The German side host Arsenal next week, but will need to win by more than four goals to go through. But those moments in attack were fleeting and Barcelona looked unfazed. They were prepared to let Arsenal have a little more of the ball – just enough, like a parent allowing their child beat them in one of five card games so as not to appear too cruel. The first goal was particularly bruising because it was utterly avoidable. The Arsenal centre-back Jen Beattie’s pass ran short and both the goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger and the stand-in centre-back Steph Catley backed away, each presumably thinking the other would collect it. Instead Aitana Bonmatí slipped forward, outran the recovering Catley and slotted coolly past Zinsberger into the far corner. Conceding seemed to suck the life out of the Gunners a little – not quite to the extent that Fran Kirby’s early strike for Chelsea preceded total collapse in last weekend’s FA Cup final, but they looked slightly deflated. Seven minutes later they failed to deal with a cross from the left-back Frida Rolfö, with Beattie not quite getting her head to it, and Jenni Hermoso was on hand to fire in from close range. On the stroke of half-time it was three, thanks to a goal befitting the classy holders. Rolfö took advantage of a heavy pass from Nikita Parris to Jordan Nobbs to take possession on the edge of the box before rounding Frida Maanum and bending a right-footed strike around Zinsberger. Conceding three to Barcelona is standard fare; only one team, the Danish side HB Køge, have conceded fewer this season, with the bottom side in Group C having lost 2-0 to the champions in October. To try to dispossess the experts of close control requires numbers, so while sometimes three red shirts would labour to poke the ball from the feet of one, a visiting player was the first to every second ball, making the hard work meaningless. Scarily this was far from Barcelona at their best, as their ruthless performance in the reverse fixture demonstrated. But it didn’t need to be. Still they provided the greater threat. Moments after a smart double stop, Zinsberger’s outstretched hand pushed away Caroline Graham Hansen’s low cross but Hermoso was at the back post to fumble the ball over the line. Fortunately, the result matters little as a point against Hoffenheim next week will send the Gunners through, and Barcelona have shown them the levels they need to reach. “We’re all learning and developing through [these new Champions League group games],” said Eidevall. “It’s great even if it doesn’t feel good losing 4-0.”",Sport/Football,Jenni Hermoso doubles up as dominant Barcelona rout Arsenal in WCL,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/09/arsenal-barcelona-womens-champions-league-match-report
12/10/2021,"On the Road, Jack Kerouac’s seminal novel of the Beat generation, “sold a trillion Levi’s, [and] a million espresso coffee machines”, as the writer’s friend and fellow poet William Burroughs once wrote. Now one of the coolest books in the literary canon is in the fashion spotlight as the inspiration for a Dior menswear collection unveiled at a blockbuster London catwalk show.  The British creative director of Dior menswear, Kim Jones, is a collector of rare books and literary memorabilia. His library of Beat editions and artefacts includes Kerouac’s mother’s copy of On the Road; books inscribed by Burroughs to the artist David Hockney; letters between the group, and even the poet Allen Ginsberg’s credit card. The book jacket of Jones’s early edition of Kerouac’s novel Visions of Cody, illustrated with two rugged James Dean lookalikes dressed for a road trip, came to life on the catwalk as models with gelled hair and spectacles wore checked shirts, sheepskin-collared trucker jackets and jeans cropped high above brogues and clashing socks. There were book cover T-shirts, and Dior football jerseys referencing Kerouac’s sports scholarship at Columbia University. “American sportswear is to me the basis of the modern men’s wardrobe,” said Jones at a preview of the show. “I wanted the collection to feel a little bit like a suitcase you might take on a road trip.” Luxe logo-emblazoned bags, however, were surely inspired by what keeps Dior profits ticking over, rather than what a Beat poet would have taken on the road. The dive into history was a departure for Jones, winner of designer of the year at last week’s Fashion Awards, who has energised high-end menswear by opening it up to the influence of “hypebeast” streetwear. He collaborated with Nike to create the sellout Air Dior sneakers, and with Supreme during his previous role at Louis Vuitton. However, Jones believes that Beat literature has as visceral a connection to youth culture as sneakers and streetwear do. “Models have been coming in for fittings [for this show] and often they have read the book – and they can actually quote passages from it because they’ve read it much more recently than me. I read it in my late teens, like you do.” Kerouac was a contemporary of Christian Dior, who burst on to the Paris fashion scene after the second world war. Although published in 1957, the first draft of On the Road was written six years earlier, “very much the same time that Christian Dior was changing things”, Jones said. “There is a synergy between two different ways of approaching how you change the world.” In 2021, he sees the anti-establishment spirit of Kerouac as chiming with how young people are questioning the identities and allegiances of their parents’ generation. “The moment when a counterculture becomes the culture, I find that so interesting,” said Jones. “That’s why I love Bloomsbury too.” The show was Jones’s first in London since 2003. “It’s a homecoming – unfortunately, at a very weird time,” he said. A selection of his personal library was displayed in a temporary exhibition staged for the night of the show, “because we have a lot of students coming from Saint Martins and I thought it would be nice for them to see how you come up with the idea for a collection”. Jim Sampas, Kerouac’s nephew and the literary executor of his estate, consulted with Jones on the project. Sampas predicts a revival of interest around next year’s centenary of Kerouac’s birth. Speaking to Women’s Wear Daily this week, Sampas said of the show: “I’m anticipating designs that draw from mid-century aesthetics [and] channel the energy and adventurousness of Kerouac’s prose, with a modern twist appealing to a 2022 audience.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,From road trip to catwalk: Jack Kerouac classic inspires Dior collection,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/dec/09/jack-kerouac-on-the-road-inspires-dior-menswear-collection
12/10/2021,"Adeadly mass shooting at a suburban Michigan high school brought back a familiar American routine: utterances of shock, followed by condolences, blame, and then calls for action that fall on deaf ears. Last week’s school shooting came as young people across the US are reckoning with a historic surge in gun violence. While shootings on school campuses declined significantly during the pandemic – incidents where a gun was fired at US schools dropped from 130 to 96 between 2019 and 2020, according to a database from Everytown for Gun Safety – community gun violence rose dramatically in that same period. Gun violence deaths rose a staggering 30% from 2019 to 2020 nationwide, the sharpest rise in 60 years.  In California, where homicides – mostly by guns – were up 30% last year, six teens told the Guardian about their experiences in the past year and a half. They spoke about hearing about fatal shootings through the grapevine and on the news during the pandemic months, and watching their peers become caught in the cycle of violence. Gun violence has rocked their communities for years, the teenagers say, but the pandemic years have been particularly scary and isolating. And they talked about gun violence creeping back into their school lives, pointing to easy access to guns, social media beefs and petty arguments as catalysts for violence among their peers. Addressing this cycle of violence, they warned, would require a combination of support in schools and communities. “A lot of us have plans that we can’t even make happen because we die at 18 and 19. It’s just a big war zone that we’re facing and I don’t know how it’s gonna be stopped,” says Cianna Williams, a 19-year-old San Francisco Bay Area native. “Some young people really want help but just don’t know how to get it,” she adds. “They cry for help but no one sees them and adults will just give up on kids and say, ‘Oh, they’re just bad anyway.’” Growing up in East Oakland, Williams was never personally caught up in gun violence, she says. Still, there were frequent shootings in the neighborhood and seeing how it affected her peers often hurt. So when she was 16 she started going to YR Media (formerly named Youth Radio), an Oakland non-profit where students learn multimedia production and storytelling. There she learned to turn her feelings into poetry. Williams went to high school in San Lorenzo, about 12 miles outside of Oakland, and graduated in 2020. Even on campus guns were a presence, she says. In 2018, two students were arrested for having loaded 9mm handguns on campus, one in March and the other in May. “We had to go through that lockdown twice. But that’s what happens when a kid has a gun.” Less than a year after she graduated high school, the violence would hit close to home. On 11 April 2021, Williams began receiving messages from people telling her that they were sorry for her loss. She was confused until a friend FaceTimed her in tears and told her that her close friend Demetrius Fleming-Davis had been shot and killed by a stray bullet the day before. Williams had been friends with Fleming-Davis since they were seven. He had encouraged her to use her voice and poetry to express herself and process her feelings about gun violence. “I was so hurt when it happened. I had never experienced losing someone so close to me,” Williams recalls. Williams had to quit her job at Home Depot after Fleming-Davis was killed, unable to stop crying on the job. “I was dealing with a lot of depression. I couldn’t do anything and I couldn’t connect with anyone.” Four months later, Williams would receive more tragic news. Her friend Danny Trask, 19, was found dead in Dixon, a rural town about 20 miles outside of Sacramento. The Solano county sheriff’s department declined to comment on the cause of Trask’s death but said authorities believed foul play had been involved and that three people had been arrested in connection with the teen’s death. “When Demetrius passed, I thought something was against me. Then Danny died a couple months after and I couldn’t understand why I was losing people so close to me,” Williams says. At least 258 people under the age of 20 were killed in California in 2020, 208 of them with a gun, according to a Guardian analysis of 2020 homicide data. That number is up from 214 people in that age range killed in 2019. One hundred and sixty-four of the slayings were with a firearm, according to the same analysis. And while there is no firm data yet on the number of youth killed in 2021, the highs of 2020 appear to be holding this year, though shootings and homicides are happening at a slower pace, according to a July 2021 report from the Council on Criminal Justice. The burden of this violence fell disproportionately on California’s Black and brown communities. About 45% of the state’s more than 2,200 homicide victims in 2020 were Latino and 30% were Black. Latinos make up nearly 40% of the state’s population and Black residents make up just 6%.Seventeen-year-old Samantha Walton has experienced gun violence in the Bay Area during the pandemic as a “disaster”. “I know a lot of people have guns to be safe but you shouldn’t have to because you’re a kid, you should be worrying about school and living life,” says the San Francisco resident, who works with Us 4 Us, a youth development non-profit. “We have to see that violence and we can’t go outside and have fun without knowing that somebody just died out there. I just wonder, ‘Damn, who’s next?’ Nothing should be so serious to where everybody is just killing each other. We’ve got like little kids, sisters and brothers out here that don’t even make it to 18.” “I know people die all the time and I had friends who died when they were 17, 18 and 19,” says 17-year-old Dophie Collazo, also an Us 4 Us participant. “After a certain amount of bodies, you’re not gonna feel the same type of emotion, but you still can’t turn a blind eye to the fact that the rate is higher now – a lot higher.” Collazo and Walton say tensions have been aggravated by social media, with small issues and rumors blown out of proportion as everyone spent more time on their phones at home during the pandemic. The ease with which teens can get a gun – whether stolen from cars and homes or bought online or on the street – can turn Instagram spats into fatal encounters. “I’ve seen things go from a crumb to a whole loaf of bread. Everybody’s got a gun, you can order it to the house and have it done in a few minutes,” Collazo says. “There are people and influences and stuff that make it seem like guns and shooting is OK and it’s cool and people will catch a body trying to earn a stripe.” Damien Posey, the founder of Us 4 Us, says he’s also seen social media beefs intensify as more students were online due to digital learning and boredom during Covid-induced lockdowns. “The arguments and jealousy are nothing new but the issues enhanced through social media, and the young people today have access to 30-sticks and 50-drums and 100 rounds,” Posey says of the types of ammunition youth get their hands on. Posey, 43, was shot five times on three different occasions by the time he was 18 and says he’s trying to keep today’s teens away from the situations he faced in his youth. While classes were held online, he continued his work with San Francisco students and held weekly Zoom conversations about current events. “When I asked how they felt about the shootings, some were numb to it, and many were discouraged about their future,” Posey says. “They knew they weren’t involved in anything but people who aren’t involved still get shot in their neighborhood.” Exposure to gun violence affects people at the neurological level and is especially harmful in the still-developing brains of children and teenagers, Dr Nadine Burke Harris, California’s surgeon general, tells the Guardian. The pandemic has made it more likely for teenagers to see and experience traumatic situations while stripping away the safety net that school and extracurricular activities provide, she argues. “The pandemic has been a huge stressor and also limited people’s access to the buffers against stress like safe, stable nurturing relationships and exercises with coaches, basketball teams,” Burke Harris says. Now that in-person teaching is back, Posey sees community gun violence and its ramifications bleeding on to campuses. He says that some students aren’t going back to campus and others, as young as 13, are returning to campus with firearms so they won’t be caught off guard if something happens on campus or off. “A lot of kids aren’t going back to school because they’re afraid of being shot or they’re afraid of getting caught with their gun because they have to have it,” Posey said. “Others are coming back with guns. I’m sure it’s happening more than we know, because the students know they’re not supposed to have them, so they keep it a secret.” As of 7 December, there have been at least 149 incidents in which a gun has been fired at or near a school, according to a database maintained by Everytown for Gun Safety. They include shootings in hallways, outside of basketball and football games and on nearby city streets. A few days into the school year, on 13 August, an Albuquerque, New Mexico, middle school student was shot and killed by one of his peers on campus. On 20 August, 19-year-old D’Anthony Fields was gunned down after a high school football game. Last week’s shooting in Oxford, Michigan, killed at least four students and injured another seven people. Thirteen-year-old Nathalia Jackson says she’s concerned that she and other students at her Los Angeles middle school may not be prepared or equipped if something similar were to happen on their campus. “We haven’t done [active shooter] drills this year. At this point in time I feel like we should be doing this monthly,” Jackson says. “I always think about that. And it’s not like I’m overthinking or overreacting. If a school shooting were to happen and I come face to face with this, there’s no realistic way that it will end up good. There’s no way to hide. There’s no way to run.” School shootings are just one type of gun violence that is on Jackson’s radar. Her father, Kenny Jackson, was shot and killed in 2013 during a robbery at his Van Nuys electronics store. Nathalia was only five when her dad was killed but she has been vocal about her family’s pursuit of answers and has become a vocal gun violence prevention activist with local organizations including Justice for Homicide Victims and Justice for Murdered Children. “I was forced to grow up because of the circumstances. I really wish I wasn’t because now I feel like I take everything too seriously,” she adds. “As much as I’d like to talk about with my friends, gun violence is so sad and you don’t want to be the downer.” Joseph Bejar, 15, is a part of the same organizations as Nathalia and has been attending rallies and workshops since his family came across a group that supports the family of homicide victims during a visit to his father’s gravesite. Bejar’s father, Vincent Bejar, was shot and killed in Bellflower in 2008. Joseph was just a toddler when his father was killed. He, like Nathalia, struggles to talk about what he’s been through with his peers but feels that these honest conversations with his family and other group members who’ve lost loved ones discourages him from getting involved in gun violence. “I feel like if I didn’t have my family to talk to, I would just be a different person and filled with more anger,” he says. “I feel safe and know I don’t have to turn to the streets. People say it’s a brotherhood in the streets but I feel bad for people who have to turn to that because it’s all fun and games until you get caught up.” DonoVan Baldwin, 16, says he’s had several close calls with violence on and off-campus. His older brother, Robert Anthony Proano, was shot and killed at age 22 in Long Beach in 2014. DonoVan was in third grade at the time and was on his way to a nearby skate park with his other brother and aunt when they heard the gunshots that killed Proano and rushed home. “That shattered us. I looked up to my brother like a best friend. He taught me so much,” DonoVan says. “I went through therapy for like seven years and still today, I have PTSD. I’m scared of guns. It’s messed me up.” Since then, DonoVan says he’s been shot at while walking with friends and gets confronted by local gang members about where he’s from and who he’s affiliated with. He’s a part of the marching band at Jordan high school in Long Beach and says he’s even been “banged on” – confronted by gang members – when leaving games and practices. And while he says he’s never felt he needed to carry a gun himself, a couple of run-ins that could have turned violent, and seeing family and peers emulate the gun culture they see in music videos and on social media, have him reconsidering. “A lot of people know my face and they don’t see me as an enemy, but I’m scared for my safety all the time, because I know I can be a loose cannon and I’m not just going to let nobody just think that they’re going to walk over me,” he says. “But I try to be more patient now because I don’t want to lose my life over stupidity.” The teens say they don’t get enough support – whether it’s from their schools, the government or communities – to deal with the gun violence that they witness. They say that adults who have lived through the violence of the 1990s and early 2000s should step into anti-violence and mentorship work in schools and community centers, as Posey has. “When kids experience gun violence in the community, one of the first places they go to after that is school,” Burke Harris said. “That’s the first institution that interacts with them and they need to be equipped to act as a buffer for students.” Outside of schools, Posey says violence interrupters and mentors like him need support from cities so they can scale their work and make sure their programs are sustainable. “I want to see the city provide financial support, technical support and support us in the media,” Posey says. “What I’m trying to do is not perfect, it’s not the end-all be-all, but it’s something in a lot of places where young people don’t have anything.”",News/US news,‘I just wonder who’s next’: six California teens on living amid rising gun violence,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/09/california-gun-violence-teenagers-youth
12/10/2021,"Boris Johnson was accused of misleading his own ethics adviser last night, exposing the prime minister to a potential suspension from the House of Commons, as MPs demanded a fresh probe into his personal donors. With pressure mounting after a disastrous series of mistakes and scandals, Johnson’s integrity was once again under the spotlight after an official report suggested he gave differing accounts to investigators looking into the redecoration of his Downing Street flat.  Their calls were provoked by a report published yesterday by the Electoral Commission, which had spent eight months investigating the funding of the costly redecoration. The commission fined the Conservative party £17,800 for serious donation reporting failures relating to the work. But documents released by the commission also revealed Johnson sent a WhatsApp message to the Tory donor Lord Brownlow in November last year seeking more money for the costly makeover. In an earlier inquiry into the matter, Johnson had assured Lord Geidt, the independent adviser on ministers’ interests, that he did not know who had given money for the work until it was revealed by the media in February this year. Though Downing Street denied there was any inconsistency, Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner said Johnson “must now explain why he lied to the British public”. She said the prime minister was taking people for fools. The Labour MP Margaret Hodge has written to the parliamentary standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, urging her to investigate whether Johnson misledLord Geidt, who had cleared him of breaching the ministerial code. In a letter seen by the Guardian, Hodge said it “appears that the prime minister may have lied” to Geidt’s inquiry about when Johnson became aware of the donations. “If these allegations are true, then this would be an egregious case of dishonesty and a breach of the Nolan principles.” Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said the discrepancy in accounts was “extremely serious”. “How do standards function if PM doesn’t tell truth to Geidt?” she tweeted. Geidt is said to be expecting an explanation from Johnson about the potential discrepancy between what he was told and what the Electoral Commission report found. Should Stone launch an investigation, it would set Conservative MPs up for another clash over the regulation of MPs, with many Tories still wounded from an attempt to change the rules over sanctions for the Tory MP Owen Paterson, who was found to have breached lobbying rules. Though it would be politically unprecedented, the commissioner’s powers do include recommending the suspension of an MP and – depending on the length of the suspension – a recall petition in their constituency. If 10% of voters there are in favour of a byelection, the MP must face the voters again The furore over the flat refurbishment has dogged Johnson for months. The money for the work came from the Tory peer, David Brownlow, via his company Huntswood Associates Ltd. It was used to cover the costs of extensive and costly refurbishment changes to the flat above No 11 Downing Street, where Johnson, his wife, Carrie, and their children live. The commission’s report sets out previously unreported details that suggest Johnson knew about the donation from Brownlow earlier than he had previously told Geidt. In his report, Geidt said the prime minister insisted “he knew nothing about such payments until immediately prior to media reports in February 2021”. Nevertheless, the commission’s report makes clear that on 23 June 2020, Johnson offered Brownlow the role of chair of the Downing Street Trust role, and on 29 November messaged Brownlow on WhatsApp asking him to authorise further refurbishment works on the flat. Downing Street claimed there was no inconsistency between the Geidt and Electoral Commission reports, as Johnson only knew that Brownlow was organising donations to pay for the refurbishment works, not that Brownlow was himself “the underlying donor”. Brownlow had “behaved in a confidential manner” after being appointed to head the blind trust in June 2020, Johnson’s spokesperson said. “Despite the prime minister and Lord Brownlow having some limited contact during the following three months, the record shows no evidence that the prime minister had been informed by Lord Brownlow that he had personally settled the total cost,” he said. The spokesperson declined to explain why some payments for the flat, including one of £59,000, were cited in the new report but had not seemingly been declared by Johnson, saying this was “in the most part a matter for” Conservative HQ. They added: “The prime minister has acted in accordance with the rules at all times. He has made any requisite declarations.” Saying Johnson had full confidence in Geidt, the spokesperson declined to say whether Geidt had seen the messages to Brownlow before writing his report. In total, Johnson repaid more than £110,000 for flat refurbishments, reported to have included wallpaper costing £840 a roll. Carrie Johnson is reported to have enlisted the sought-after interior designer Lulu Lyttle for the works. Brownlow was approached to chair the Downing Street Trust, a trust to pay for works to Downing Street using anonymous donations. By June, when lockdown began to ease, the refurbishment was under way. The Cabinet Office agreed to pay the extra costs from three invoices totalling £52,801, then be reimbursed by the Conservatives on the basis that a trust would be set up later. Around a month later, on 6 August, the party reimbursed the government. In September, the supplier then invoiced the Cabinet Office for a further £12,967, which was forwarded first to Brownlow and then to Conservative central headquarters (CCHQ). The following month, Brownlow confirmed in a crucial paper trail email that he would be making a £15,000 donation and “£52,801.72 to cover payments the party has made on behalf of the soon-to-be-formed ‘Downing Street Trust’ of which I am chairman”. On the same day, 19 October, he paid £12,967 to the supplier for the invoice received in September. When a junior party staffer raised questions about the £52,801 which was treated as “funds for reimbursement” rather than a donation, they were told by a senior fundraising officer: “Don’t worry.” Brownlow made two more payments directly to the supplier, bringing the total sum to £112,549. The following month, Johnson paid back the cash to the supplier, which then returned the funds it had received from Brownlow and the Cabinet Office. How Johnson footed the bill remains unknown. The commission said: “Any payments between the prime minister and the supplier are outside the scope of our investigation.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson accused of misleading ethics adviser over No 10 refurb,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/09/boris-johnson-accused-of-misleading-ethics-adviser-over-no-10-refurb

12/10/2021,"Three UK cabinet ministers have gone into isolation after being in close contact with the Australian deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, who later tested positive for Covid. Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister and justice secretary, and Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, pulled out of events after their contact with Joyce when he visited London earlier this week.  Later, a spokesman for Michael Gove said the communities secretary is also self-isolating after coming into contact with Joyce. Under the law, close contacts of positive Covid cases do not have to isolate as long as they get a PCR test and the result comes back negative. However, anyone who is a close contact of someone confirmed or suspected of being infected with the Omicron variant must take daily tests. Joyce, who is fully vaccinated, has since left the UK and tested positive only once he was in Washington. He said in a Facebook post on Thursday that he was experiencing mild symptoms, had been tested and was isolating, awaiting further advice. Shapps had been due to visit a Hitachi Rail rolling stock assembly plant in County Durham on Thursday. He said in a tweet: “Have taken precaution of cancelling visit and have taken PCR test after being in contact with Australian Deputy PM this week – who’s tested positive for Covid.” Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Raab said: “He is getting tested and he is self-isolating while we wait to hear whether the Australian deputy prime minister has Omicron or not.” In an interview on Sky News, Joyce said he did not know when he acquired Covid-19 – but that the UK was crowded with people preparing for Christmas and going shopping. “You wouldn’t think there’s a pandemic on in areas of the UK,” he said. While in isolation Joyce said he planned to watch cricket, do some paperwork and read a book. He indicated it had not changed his ideas on the need to move on from the pandemic. “I’m still of the same view – you know, we can’t just shut the whole place down,” Joyce said. “The world’s got to move on. It’s not economically possible for any nation to go into permanent shutdown – you’ll go broke.” Most cabinet ministers in the UK have had to isolate at several points during the pandemic, either because of catching Covid themselves or being identified as a close contact.

12/10/2021,"During the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell in New York the prosecution introduced photographs never before seen publicly, showing the British socialite with Jeffrey Epstein. The images show the close relationship between Maxwell and Epstein, the late, disgraced sex offender who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial, also in New York. Maxwell is charged in relation to procuring underage teen girls between 1994 and 2004 for Epstein, who sexually abused them. Maxwell and Epstein on his private jet, dubbed the ‘Lolita Express’.  Celebrities and politicians were among the regular high-profile passengers on Epstein’s plane. During Maxwell’s trial Larry Visoski, Epstein’s longtime pilot, said he remembered seeing two of Maxwell’s accusers on Epstein’s planes. Visoski said Prince Andrew and Donald Trump were also among the passengers on Epstein’s planes. Epstein is seen outside one of his planes in an undated photo. Maxwell, the daughter of the deceased British press baron Robert Maxwell, met Epstein about three decades ago and became, the court heard, the “No 2” in Epstein’s social and household hierarchy. Epstein is seen here embracing his then personal assistant Sarah Kellen, who later went by the name Sarah Kensington. Maxwell with Kellen, who has since married Nascar driver Brian Vickers. Kellen was among four named Epstein associates identified by US prosecutors as “potential co-conspirators” in a controversial plea deal Epstein struck in 2007, after admitting he solicited prostitution from a minor. The pair are seen in a warmer weather setting. Right, Maxwell and Epstein don fur hats and cold weather attire in this undated image. Maxwell and Epstein enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, and traveled together around the world. Prosecutors said Maxwell was “involved in every detail of Epstein’s life”. Maxwell kisses Epstein on a sunny street. Right; undated. The financier owned homes in New Mexico, Palm Beach, New York City, US Virgin Islands and Paris. Maxwell “preyed on vulnerable young girls, manipulated them and served them up to be sexually abused” by Epstein, prosecutors said. Maxwell denies all of the sex-trafficking charges against her. Maxwell’s attorney has claimed Maxwell is being punished for Epstein’s misdeeds. “Ever since Eve was accused of tempting Adam for the apple, women have been blamed for the bad behavior of men,” Bobbi Sternheim told the court.

12/10/2021,"Five iconoclastic Italian films directed by Lina Wertmüller, who has died aged 93, were huge hits in the mid-1970s on the American art cinema circuit, where they broke box office records for foreign films. Using bold colours and alienating camera angles, and dealing with subjects such as political injustice, gender disparities, sexual violence and eroticism, her films, most of them starring Giancarlo Giannini as a moustachioed, ineffectual lover, seemed to chime with the sense of rebellion in the air in the US at the time. One of these films, Pasqualino Settebellezze (Seven Beauties, 1975), led to her becoming the first woman to be nominated for a best director Academy Award. She was also nominated for her screenplay: Wertmüller wrote most of her own films.  Seven Beauties starred Giannini as a small-time crook and womaniser who lives in Naples with his mother and seven sisters, the beauties of the title. After killing a pimp while defending the honour of the eldest sister, he is put into an asylum, where he rapes an inmate, then joins the Italian army, deserts, is captured by the Germans and sent to a concentration camp where he becomes involved with a sadistic female commandant. According to the New York Times, the film was “Miss Wertmüller’s King Kong, her Nashville, her 8 ½, her Navigator, her City Lights”. Aside from their particular style and content, Wertmüller’s films had long, attention-grabbing titles in Italian, such as Film d’Amore e d’Anarchia, ovvero Stamattina alle 10 in Via dei Fiori nella Nota Casa di Tolleranza (Film of Love and Anarchy, or At Ten o’clock This Morning in Via dei Fiori in the Infamous House of Prostitution, released as Love and Anarchy, 1973). The English title of Travolti da un Insolito Destino nell’Azzurro Mare d’Agosto (1974) was, however, soon shortened from Swept Away by an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August to, simply, Swept Away (remade in 2002 by Guy Ritchie, starring his wife at the time, Madonna). The original title of her film Blood Feud (1978) holds the world record for being the longest in existence. Perhaps Wertmüller’s taste for outrageously prolix titles came about because she had a lengthy title herself. Born Arcangela Felice Assunta in Rome, into a devoutly Roman Catholic Swiss family of aristocratic descent, she was the daughter of Maria Santamaria-Maurizio and Federico Wertmüller von Elgg Spañol von Braueich, a lawyer. A rebellious child, Lina was expelled from more than a dozen Catholic schools. She finally graduated from a drama school, after which she worked in the theatre, acting, directing and writing for 10 years, as well as touring Europe with a puppet company. Wertmüller made a successful directorial debut with The Lizards (I Basilischi, 1963). The film, which somewhat resembled I Vitelloni by Federico Fellini, for whom she had been assistant on 8½ the year before, was set in a sleepy, impoverished southern Italian town where a group of young men spend their time ogling women and vegetating in the sun. Nothing much happens in the film, or to the aimless characters, but Wertmüller displayed a sharp eye, a keen sense of humour and a restrained neo-realist aesthetic not so present in her later work. Some years passed before the promise of I Basilischi was fulfilled, followed as it was by several conventional genre movies: Questa Volta Parliamo di Uomini (Let’s Talk About Men, 1965), a four-part episode film starring Nino Manfredi; a fey musical, Rita la Zanzara (Rita the Mosquito, 1966), on which she was credited as George H Brown, and a spaghetti western, Il Mio Corpo per un Poker (The Belle Starr Story, 1968), under the pseudonym of Nathan Wich. Then came Metallurgico Ferito nell’Onore (1972), released in English-language countries as The Seduction of Mimi. Giannini played Mimi, a simple labourer in southern Italy who finds himself caught between the local mafia on the one hand and the communist party on the other. He offends the mafia and has an affair with a liberated, anarchic girl (Mariangela Melato), thus driving his wife into the arms of another man and himself to some grotesquely ill-judged behaviour. Demonstrating the director’s penchant for a stew of sex and politics, the film is a bitter and humorous comment on Sicilian society. In Love and Anarchy, Giannini played a simple farmer, committed to an anti-fascist group that dispatches him to assassinate Mussolini. He lodges in a brothel where he falls in love with one of the prostitutes (Lina Polito), and this, together with his vulnerability, impedes his mission and leads him to his own violent destruction. The film’s thesis – romanticism is not a realistic basis for political activism – is a telling one, and Wertmüller, despite a self-indulgent camera style, achieves an authentic evocation of the disturbed atmosphere of 1930s Italy. Tutto a Posto e Niente in Ordine (All Screwed Up, 1974) follows a group of young people from the country who go to Milan and form a commune to enable them to survive the economic evils of the big city. Any social, political or satiric points are rather blunted by deliberate bad taste – for example, a ballet in an abattoir. In Swept Away, a sexist, communist Sicilian deckhand is cast adrift on a dinghy with his rich boss’s liberated wife (Giannini and Melato again). After two nights, they reach an island on which they carry out a series of sado-masochistic sexual and class strategies. The desert island plot works as a determinist parable in which people’s sexual attitudes are governed by economics and class, though it fails to avoid gender stereotypes. Because of Wertmüller’s extraordinary run of hits, and the Oscar attention for Seven Beauties, Warner Brothers offered her a four-picture deal to make movies in English. The studio regretted its decision when Wertmüller delivered The End of the World in Our Usual Bed in a Night Full of Rain, generally abbreviated to A Night Full of Rain (1978). . It starred Candice Bergen and Giannini as an ill-assorted couple, she an ardent feminist, American photographer, he a macho, communist Italian journalist, who spend their time arguing and reconciling at length. After the film gathered bad reviews, Warners and Wertmüller agreed to part company, she explaining that in any case she wanted more creative freedom than the studio would allow. Lew Grade’s company mainly financed Blood Feud (1978), but despite starring Sophia Loren, Marcello Mastroianni and Giannini, the mafia thriller failed to generate much enthusiasm. Wertmüller continued to make Sicilian-set gangster films with intriguingly long titles such as Un Complicato Intrigo di Donne, Vicoli e Delitti (A Complex Plot About Women, Alleys and Crimes, 1985) and Notte d’Estate con Profilo Greco, Occhi a Mandorla e Odore di Basilico (Summer Night, with Greek Profile, Almond Eyes and Scent of Basil, 1986). She then made In Una Notte di Chiaro di Luna (Crystal or Ash, Fire or Wind, as Long as It’s Love, 1989), a well-meaning and, she said, “first non-ironic film”, about Aids, shot in New York, with Peter O’Toole, Rutger Hauer and Faye Dunaway. It seemed that she had lost some of her bite, even in an attempt to return to her earlier socio-political comedies with Metalmeccanico e Parrucchiera in un Turbine di Sesso e di Politica (The Blue Collar Worker and the Hairdresser in a Whirl of Sex and Politics, 1996). Her last feature was the barely released comedy Peperoni Ripieni e Pesci in Faccia (Too Much Romance ... It’s Time for Stuffed Peppers, 2004), starring Loren as a grandmother in a dysfunctional family. In 2019 the Barbican in London included Wertmüller in a season of neglected directors, lauding her for her “unflinching critique of fascist Italy, her embrace of ribald humour, and her dissections of entitled masculinity”. A 2015 documentary made by her assistant Valerio Ruiz, Behind the White Glasses – referencing her trademark spectacles – was screened alongside the films. In 2019, she received a lifetime achievement Academy Award. Wertmüller’s husband, Enrico Job, the art director on many of her films, died in 2008. She is survived by their daughter, Maria Zulima.

12/10/2021,"Cases of the Omicron variant could be spreading even faster in England than in South Africa, according to a senior scientific adviser, who warned that the variant was a “very severe setback” to hopes of bringing the pandemic under control. Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said that plan B measures announced by the prime minister were “absolutely not an overreaction” even if Omicron turned out to be milder than the current dominant variant.  Edmunds told a Royal Society of Medicine webinar on Thursday that it was “extremely likely” there were many more cases of Omicron in the community than those confirmed by testing, and that the numbers were set to soar in the weeks ahead. The UK Health Security Agency identified a further 249 Omicron cases on Thursday, almost twice the number announced the day before, bringing the UK total to 817. Edmunds said that if the UK had 1,000 cases today, then a doubling time of two to three days would drive the number up to 8,000 in a week and 64,000 in two weeks. Those would come on top of the continuing wave of Delta infections. “Nobody wants to have to reintroduce these measures. It’s very damaging for parts of the economy – the hospitality and retail sector, in particular, are going to be affected – but unfortunately we have to do it,” he said. “With the speed of spread of this virus, we may well have really significant numbers of cases by Christmas,” he added. “I suspect that whatever we do now, we are unlikely to overreact.” Given the rate of community transmission, he said, travel restrictions were “not really going to do much now”. The warning came as the government reported a further 50,867 daily Covid cases, 813 more admissions to hospital and 148 additional deaths on Thursday, marking rises on all measures over the past week. Speaking at the online event, Edmunds dismissed suggestions that the Omicron variant might be “good news” if it hospitalised people at only half the rate as the Delta variant. The hope comes largely from hospital admissions in South Africa, where the population is far younger than in the UK and so less likely to experience severe Covid illness in the first place. While the average age in the UK is just over 40, it is less than 28 in South Africa. Edmunds said there was “not a shred of evidence” that Omicron was half as pathogenic as the Delta variant, but added that even if this were the case, it might not make the difference people hoped for. “This is a very severe setback. There is no question about that.” “If you are worried about the time [at] which the NHS might start to get very stressed, then halving the hospitalisation rate means that buys you two to three days. I think it’s really silly to suggest this is good news; it couldn’t be further from that,” he added. “This is as bad news as you can possibly get, quite frankly.” It will take several weeks for scientists to get a sense of how severe the disease is in the UK, where the vast majority of people have some immunity against earlier variants either through vaccination or previous infection. This week, Pfizer released data from a small lab study suggesting that three shots of its vaccine might hold up well against the Omicron variant, but Edmunds said it was the most optimistic of five or so studies he had seen on vaccine protection against the variant. Despite the uncertainties, Edmunds said it was “absolutely critical” for people to get their booster doses “as rapidly as possible”: “I think it will help, and it will help very significantly, but I still think we are likely to be under quite a lot of pressure in a very short time.” Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, who also took part in the webinar, said he favoured vaccinating children aged five to 11, adding that uncertainties over the medium- to long-term consequences of Covid were “much more worrying” than the potential side-effects of the vaccine. Edmunds agreed, adding that if the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency approved the jab for those aged five to 11, it should be rolled out as rapidly as possible. “We’re certainly not out of the woods,” Edmunds said. “I think over the next two months we’re going to see a really rather large wave of Omicron. We are going to get a large number of cases, and it will result in a large numbers of hospitalisations, and unfortunately it will result in a large number of deaths. I’m pretty sure of that.”",News/World news,"Omicron could be spreading faster in England than in South Africa, Sage adviser says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/09/daily-omicron-cases-in-uk-could-exceed-60000-by-christmas-sage-adviser-says
12/10/2021,"Good morning. Australia’s coal-fired power plants are likely to shut more rapidly than expected. The Omicron variant is in 57 countries. And the bogong moth has been added to the endangered species list. Coal-fired power plants are likely to shut at almost triple the pace now announced, with Victoria’s brown coal fleet to be closed in just over a decade and the main electricity grid becoming coal-free by 2043, according to the market operator. The draft Integrated System Plan 2022, an industry blueprint updated every two years and released today, plots how the grid serving eastern Australia will change to meet emissions reduction and market goals. It details four scenarios based on extensive consultation over 18 months. The most probable path, dubbed the “step change” option, anticipates a nine-fold increase in large-scale renewable energy.  The Omicron variant has now been reported in 57 countries, the World Health Organization says. But the latest epidemiological report from WHO says it is still too early to draw any conclusions about its global impact, given that the Delta variant remains dominant, particularly in Europe and the US. But the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has predicted Omicron could become dominant in Europe within months. In South Africa, Covid cases have surged by 255% in the past seven days but there is mounting anecdotal evidence that Omicron infections are provoking milder symptoms than in previous waves. The bad weather brought by La Niña could create a spike in Covid cases by forcing people indoors at the same time as the Omicron variant is spreading in Australia, say epidemiologists who are warning health authorities to delay the easing of social distancing measures. Epidemiologists say higher humidity allows virus particles to linger longer in the air. The bogong moth is among the 124 Australian additions to the endangered species list. The addition of the moth, famously seen in swarms at Parliament House in Canberra during its annual migration to the Australian Alps, should be a wake-up call about declines in Australia’s invertebrates, experts say. “It is a really big step for the beautiful bogong moth to be listed as endangered,” scientist Marissa Parrott said. “It is a really sad moment that a species that is so iconic to Australia, that people remember from their childhood as blocking out the moon, has now collapsed to the point of being listed as endangered.” Australian children aged five to 11 will receive the Pfizer against Covid from 10 January after the federal government accepted a recommendation for its use from immunisation experts. One-third of large companies in Australia still don’t pay any tax despite a crackdown that has been under way for five years. Transparency data released by the Australian Taxation Office on Friday shows 782 out of 2,370 of Australia’s biggest companies paid no tax in the 2019-20 financial year. The government has ordered a review into the operation of Australia’s ports, setting up a stoush with Labor over the maritime union’s industrial might. A solicitor who prepared a will for a wealthy Sydney man has denied that he had an obligation to ask why his client was leaving tens of millions of dollars to his GP. Raymond McClure, who died aged 84 in 2017, altered his will twice in the five months before he died, eventually leaving Dr Peter Alexakis 90% of his $30m estate. Uyghur people living in Xinjiang province in China have been subjected to unconscionable crimes against humanity directed by the Chinese state that amount to an act of genocide, an independent and unofficial tribunal in London has found. China has said that Australia, Britain and the US will pay a price for their “mistaken acts” after deciding not to send government delegations to the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February, in the latest warning demonstrating China’s escalating diplomatic tensions with the US and its major allies. The UK has proposed US-style waivers for EU citizens crossing the Irish border. EU citizens and other non-Irish or non-British nationals will require a waiver known as an Electronic Travel Authorisation as part of the new post-Brexit immigration nationality and borders bill. Joe Biden’s announcement that a group of Nato countries will hold talks with Moscow has caused concern among officials in Poland and other eastern and central Nato countries, who worry that any trade-off could increase the danger they face from an expansionist Russia. In Kim Stanley Robinson’s novel The Ministry for the Future, climate disasters kill tens of millions of people – and that’s a scenario he portrays as relatively optimistic. “Robinson’s optimistic view is that human nature is fundamentally thoughtful, and that it will save us,” writes Daniel Aldana Cohen. “It’s a perspective worth thinking about – so long as we’re also organising.” When Kathryn Bigelow’s 1991 film Point Break was released in the early 90s, critics were quick to dismiss it as shallow, blathering machismo. But Tiia Kelly says these critics have misunderstood this anti-establishment classic. “In Bigelow’s hands, a potentially conventional story becomes a subversive, anti-establishment film about being seduced, blackmailed and radicalised by your crush,” she writes. For most, our previous pandemic is a distant memory. But for these five polio survivors, new health problems have just begun.

On Wednesday Groves alleged on the ABC’s 7.30 Report she was sexually molested as a teenager over a five-year period by a man she refused to identify. In the ABC program, Groves said she had not made an official complaint about the man she alleged had molested her but he still worked in swimming.

12/10/2021,"Downing Street is facing a damaging revolt over planned Covid restrictions after dozens of Tory backbenchers threatened to rebel or abstain in fury over the proposed new rules and Boris Johnson’s handling of the Christmas party scandal. With at least 30 Conservative MPs already expected to vote against regulations on masks, home working and vaccine passports, and many more now vowing to stay away from Tuesday’s vote, the prime minister could be left relying on Labour support to win.  “The whips will be doing a lot of work this weekend,” one Tory MP. “It’s all about saving the PM’s blushes.” Johnson is battling the fallout from days of successive revelations about a festive gathering inside No 10 amid tough Covid rules last December. An inquiry into the reports has been expanded to examine other alleged events, including one that Johnson is believed to have attended. In further blow for the prime minister, a Survation survey for the Daily Mirror put Labour six percentage points ahead of the Conservatives, at 40% to 34%. A YouGov poll for the Times had Labour four points ahead on 37% to 33%. Announcing the hastily set up review on Wednesday following public outrage over a video showing Downing Street staff joking about the supposed party on 18 December last year, Johnson initially said it would look into only that event. Recent reports have said that Jack Doyle, the then deputy director of communications, gave out awards to staff during the evening and there was food, drinks and games. Doyle, now head of press for Downing Street, has been contacted for comment. However, the Cabinet Office minister Michael Ellis, addressing MPs on Thursday, said the investigation led by the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, would also examine another Downing Street party on 27 November last year – reportedly a leaving event at which Johnson spoke – and one at the Department for Education on 10 December. The terms of reference for the process, published later in the day, added: “Where there are credible allegations relating to other gatherings, these may be investigated.” Ministers and officials would be “expected to cooperate” with the inquiry, it said. Case and his team will establish the need for any disciplinary action, or whether potential breaches of the law should be referred to the police. Shortly after unveiling the review, Johnson announced he was introducing tougher “plan B” Covid restrictions for England because of the rapid spread of the Omicron variant – a move that some speculated was timed in part to distract attention from the parties, but which Tory MPs say has instead magnified their annoyance and frustration. The likely collision point will be next Tuesday, when MPs will vote on the restrictions, covering an extension to mandatory mask-wearing, advice to work from home and, most controversially, the introduction of Covid status certificates as a condition of entry to venues such as nightclubs and football grounds. A BBC tally said at least 22 Tory MPs had already said they would vote against the rules, with a dozen more expressing wariness. One backbencher said they also expected “a high number” of others deciding not to vote. “What that looks like exactly is unclear, but it is unlikely to be a good day for the government,” they warned. Up to a quarter of parliamentary private secretaries, the junior rank of ministerial aides, are believed to be seeking official permission to miss the vote, allowing them to avoid backing the plan without having to resign, but whips are refusing. “A lot of MPs seem to want to campaign in the North Shropshire byelection that day,” one backbencher said. A senior MP said they believed they had “already lost [their] seat” and thus felt “ungovernable”. “The mood on the backbenches is really angry,” yet another backbencher said. “It’s going to be quite a sizeable rebellion. I think the government will only get this through with Labour votes. It’s a bit like the Theresa May Brexit days – which is somewhere I never really wanted to go back to.” The sense of resentment combined both the shift in Covid rules and the furore over illicit Christmas parties, they said. “It’s us who get the angry emails saying about the Downing Street parties. We’re the ones who get it in the neck. So you’re much less willing to bail out the boss, particularly with unforced errors. “People are much more forgiving if it’s a single issue. When us backbenchers have been marched up and down the hill one too many times, it’s not conducive for morale.” The new Covid rules are being introduced over the next few days, with the extension of mandatory mask use to include such venues as theatres and cinemas starting from Friday. While that is before the Commons vote, the regulations can be changed immediately and approved by MPs retrospectively. In an apparent attempt to help get Tory MPs onside, Downing Street insisted Johnson was not advocating possible mandatory vaccinations when he told a press conference on Wednesday that there might come a time to “have a conversation” about more ways to combat Covid. Johnson was simply “making a broader point on the intention to keep developing further mitigations against coronavirus”, his spokesperson said.",News/Politics,Government faces Tory backbench revolt over plan B Covid measures,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/09/government-faces-tory-backbench-revolt-over-plan-b-covid-measures
12/10/2021,"Sundance film festival returns to semi-normality next month with a lineup including new films from Lena Dunham, John Boyega and Emma Thompson.  The 2021 iteration was forced online as a result of Covid-19 and while next year’s will still have a virtual component, the Utah-based festival will bring back limited in-person screenings, events and parties. The lineup includes 82 films, which is up from last year’s total of 72 but still down from the previous year’s 118. Premieres include Sharp Stick, the new Los Angeles-set film directed by Dunham, who also appears in a small role, which tells the tale of a 26-year-old who begins an affair with her older boss. “This story is incredibly personal to me and a continuation of my career-long mission to create a free dialogue around the complexities of female sexuality and to turn the idea of the ‘likable’ female protagonist on its head,” she said. Boyega will also be headed to the festival with 892, a drama written by the acclaimed playwright Kwame Kwei-Armah based on a 2018 article. The actor, who earlier this year won a Golden Globe for his role in Small Axe, plays a veteran whose disability cheque fails to materialise leading to extreme circumstances. The film also marks one of the final roles for the late Michael K Williams, who died in September. It will be showing in competition alongside Alice, a fact-based film starring Keke Palmer as a slave who discovers that what she thought was the 1800s is actually the 1970s, and Master, a supernatural thriller about women of colour experiencing a haunting at a predominantly white New England college. British comedy Good Luck to You, Leo Grande will also premiere, starring Thompson as a widow looking for fun who hires a sex worker. Other British films set to be unfurled include Living, a Kazuo Ishiguro-scripted drama starring Bill Nighy as a civil servant who searches for meaning in his life after learning he has a fatal illness and The Princess, a new documentary about Diana, Princess of Wales. Other documentary premieres include We Need to Talk About Cosby, directed by W Kamau Bell, which looks at the disgraced sitcom star Bill Cosby, and jeen-yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy which examines the personal life and career of Ye with unprecedented access. Elizabeth Banks will also star in Call Jane, directed by Phyllis Nagy, the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of Carol, a 60s-set drama about abortion access. Sigourney Weaver also stars. “When I became involved with this, it wasn’t that timely,” Nagy said to Variety. “I mean, in this country, such things are always a little bit timely, but now there’s a sort of, urgency, I suppose, to it. That’s different. It feels different.” Other premieres include Daisy Edgar-Jones in the Adam McKay-produced “social thriller” Fresh about the horrors of modern dating, Dakota Johnson and Leslie Mann in Cha Cha Real Smooth from Cooper Raiff, the director of Shithouse, and Final Cut, from Oscar-winning director Michel Hazanavicius, about the set of a zombie movie that gets interrupted by actual zombies. “This year’s program reflects the unsettling and uncertain times we’ve been living in for the past year and a half,” said the festival’s director of programming, Kim Yutani. “The artists in the program, through their bold and innovative storytelling, and their sheer determination to create work in this moment, challenge us to look at the world through different lenses and examine and reevaluate how these stories impact us now and in the future.” Next year’s Sundance film festival will take place from 20-30 January.",Arts/Film,"Sundance 2022: Lena Dunham, John Boyega and Emma Thompson lead lineup",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/09/sundance-2022-film-festival-lena-dunham-john-boyega-emma-thompson
12/10/2021,"Leicester’s European campaign will go on but not in the way they wanted and, perhaps more distressingly, there is no end in sight to their defensive problems. Brendan Rodgers’ team contributed embarrassingly to their own defeat to an under-strength Napoli side and, as a result, dropped out of the Europa League and into the less-vaunted Europa Conference League.  “With all due respect to the competition, I’m not sure what it is,” said Rodgers, who was equally frank about his team’s shortcomings after another vexing defeat. “We were good offensively but nowhere near good enough defensively,” he said “We’ve played a number of systems and shapes [this season], individually it comes down to being able to have that mentality to track a runner or stop a cross. These are basics of the game that we’re not doing well.” The match was an exhibit of what makes Leicester such a puzzle these days. No sooner had they got themselves into a near-hopeless position by letting in two cheap goals in the first 24 minutes than they drew level with disarming ease. Then they grew hesitant and ragged again. They could not cite absences as an excuse because, even though they left behind seven players owing to Covid and other illnesses, Rodgers still deployed a near first-choice lineup. Napoli, on the other hand, were deprived of several key performers by injuries, including Kalidou Koulibaly and the gifted striker Victor Osimhen. Given the challenges faced by his team, Napoli manager Luciano Spalletti said this match would provide an “x-ray of the players’ souls”. Europa League The eight group winners – Lyon, Monaco, Spartak Moscow, Eintracht Frankfurt, Galatasaray, Red Star Belgrade, Bayer Leverkusen and West Ham – progress automatically as seeds to the last 16. The eight group runners-up – Rangers, Real Sociedad, Napoli, Olympiakos, Lazio, Braga, Real Betis and Dinamo Zagreb – go into two-legged play-off ties. In the play-offs, each team will play one of the third-placed Champions League sides – RB Leipzig, Porto, Dortmund, Sheriff, Barcelona, Atalanta, Sevilla or Zenit. The winners will progress to the last 16. Conference League The eight group winners – Lask, Gent, Roma, AZ, Feyenoord, Copenhagen, Rennes and Basel – progress to the last 16 as seeds. The eight group runners-up – Maccabi Tel-Aviv, Partizan Belgrade, Bodø/Glimt, Randers, Slavia Prague, PAOK, Qarabag and either Vitesse or Tottenham – go into the play-off round. There, they will each face one of the Europa League's third-placed teams – Sparta Prague, PSV, Leicester, Fenerbahce, Marseille, Midtjylland, Celtic or Rapid Vienna – over two legs for a last-16 place. Both play-off draws will be held on 13 December, with ties played on 17 and 24 February. The last-16 draws will follow on 25 February, with games played on 10 and 17 March. - Rodgers may have been tempted to examine his players’ heads after they conceded sloppily after four minutes, their latest mishap in a season riddled with bad starts. This time the problem began when Youri Tielemans failed to control a dicey pass by Caglar Soyuncu, allowing Piotr Zielinski to seize possession and feed Andrea Petagna. The striker’s shot from 20 yards deflected into the path of Adam Ounas, who, on his first start for Napoli in over two years, shuffled past Wilfred Ndidi and fired a low shot into the corner of the net from 12 yards. Leicester had missed a marvellous opportunity to open the scoring just a minute previously. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall cantered down the left wing and crossed to Timothy Castagne, whose shot was kept out by the combined efforts of defender Mário Rui and goalkeeper Alex Meret. Amir Rrahmani made an excellent block to deny Ndidi in the 13th minute but, that aside, Leicester’s response to falling behind was unimpressive. Their defending was abject in the 23rd minute when Napoli helped themselves to a two-goal lead. Zielinski glided through the middle before slipping a pass to Petagna, who, having been kept onside by Ryan Bertrand, eschewed an easy shooting chance in order to offer an even simpler one to Elif Elmas, who rolled the ball into the empty net. Leicester soon found an equally straightforward way back into the game. Jamie Vardy had made little impact on his first European start of the season until his failure to flick on an inswinging free-kick by James Maddison caught Elmas off guard. The ball bounced off the Napoli player and into the path of Jonny Evans, who swept it into the net. Six minutes later Leicester equalised with a better version of that goal. This time, after a free-kick was not cleared properly, Dewsbury-Hall sent a left-footed volley beyond the goalkeeper from the edge of the box. Defences were so ramshackle that more goals seemed inevitable. Elmas made it 3-2 by exploiting loose marking to collect Giovanni Di Lorenzo’s low cross from the left and score. Maddison should have equalised almost immediately after a wild pass by the home side presented him with the ball in front of goal, but he shot against the outside of the post. Leicester had time to muster another equaliser but too little precision. Vardy fluffed their best chance in stoppage time. After the final whistle went in Naples, Leicester were teased with a sudden reprieve as Legia Warsaw were awarded a late penalty in the group’s other game. But that was missed, so Spartak Moscow finished as winners of Group C, while Napoli advanced as runners-up, leaving third-placed Leicester to settle for a competition with which their manager had hoped not to get acquainted.",Sport/Football,Leicester out of Europa League after Elif Elmas double gives Napoli thrilling win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/09/napoli-leicester-europa-league-match-report
12/10/2021,"Loujain al-Hathloul, the prominent Saudi women’s rights activist, has filed a lawsuit against three former US intelligence and military officers who have admitted in a US court to helping carry out hacking operations on behalf of the United Arab Emirates. In her lawsuit, which was filed in a US district court in Oregon in conjunction with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Hathloul alleged that the actions of three men – Marc Baier, Ryan Adams, and Daniel Gericke – led to her iPhone being hacked and communication being exfiltrated by UAE security officials.  The hacking ultimately led, the lawsuit alleges, to Hathloul’s arrest from the UAE and rendition to Saudi Arabia, where she was detained, imprisoned and tortured. The lawsuit marks the first time that Hathloul, who was released from a Saudi prison earlier this year but remains confined to the kingdom, has taken legal action against the individuals who are alleged to have played a role in her detention. She gained international prominence for her human rights work, including a campaign to allow women in Saudi to drive. The three defendants have already admitted in a separate legal action brought by the US Department of Justice that they violated US export control and computer fraud laws in their previous role as senior managers for a UAE company. Attorneys for the three men did not respond to a request for comment. According to the lawsuit, the UAE company that the three men worked for – DarkMatter – used Apple’s messages app and other Apple infrastructure to deploy malware on Hathloul’s phone, which “intentionally or recklessly” transmitted malware that used servers located in the US to carry out an alleged hack of her phone. Reuters has previously reported that a campaign to hack individuals that was run by DarkMatter– known as Project Raven – targeted and hacked Hathloul, and assigned her the codename “Purple Sword”. “DarkMatter’s hacking of Ms al-Hathloul’s iPhone was part of the UAE’s campaign of persecution against perceived dissidents of itself and Saudi Arabia,” the lawsuit alleges. The lawsuit describes how, on 13 March 2018, Hathloul was intercepted and arrested while she was driving in Abu Dhabi. After being renditioned to Saudi Arabia and arrested, interrogators later mentioned “details” regarding her private communications between herself and other human rights activists, which had been transmitted via Telegram and WhatsApp. The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages against the individuals and DarkMatter.",News/Technology,Saudi women’s rights activist sues three ex-US intel operatives over hacking for UAE,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/09/saudi-womens-rights-activist-loujain-alhathloul-sues-us-intel-operatives-hacking-uae
12/10/2021,"The sprawl of alleged Covid rule-breaking parties across Westminster last Christmas is widening, as the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, placed 10 Downing Street and the Department for Education under investigation over alleged “gatherings”. Civil servants and political staff at the two locations will be questioned over who attended, exactly where and for what purpose. But there are reports of other events that are not part of Case’s inquiry.  This is what is claimed to have happened, and where. At least two parties are being investigated by Case that took place in 10 Downing Street – the office where the prime minister and his staff worked throughout the pandemic. Johnson is known to have attended the first event, on 27 November, which sources claimed was an impromptu leaving do for an aide, Cleo Watson. The prime minister remarked on how crowded the room was, and then made a short speech paying tribute to her, before leaving to continue working. But Dominic Cummings, who had left as the PM’s senior adviser earlier that month, said that it was a “red herring” to refer to the event as a party because an outgoing staff member had simply walked to the press office to say a final goodbye and Johnson “bumbled in and started babbling”. “Everyone embarrassed, dispersed,” Cummings insisted. The other gathering under investigation in No 10 was on 18 December, when London was under tier 2 restrictions – meaning indoor social mixing between households was banned. Officials and political staff had cheese and wine and reportedly swapped secret Santa presents at an event that went on late into the evening. Reports have said that Jack Doyle, the then deputy director of communications and now head of press of at No 10, gave out awards to staff during the evening. The party was explicitly referred to by Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s then spokeswoman, and No 10’s head of broadcast, Ed Oldfield, in a mock press conference that took place four days later but only came to light because of leaked footage this week. Also in the run-up to Christmas, Gavin Williamson, who at the time was education secretary, held drinks in his department for staff on 10 December. In a possible contravention of social distancing rules at the time, the department’s most senior civil servant, Susan Acland-Hood, said she attended the “work-related” gathering in which people congregated in the canteen for Williamson to “say a few words” to thank staff. Acland-Hood said that about 24 staff of mixed seniority were present. Not being formally investigated by Case is a gathering reported to have taken place in the flat used by Boris Johnson and his family on 13 November – also during England’s second lockdown. The Mail On Sunday said a “victory party” took place after Cummings left Downing Street carrying his belongings in a cardboard box. Tensions between Cummings and Carrie Johnson were well known, but her allies denied to the same newspaper that there was any kind of “boisterous celebration”. Deep inside the Cabinet Office, No 10 and other government staff were reported to have congregated for a Christmas quiz. The date is not known but it happened in December. While some people tuned in virtually, others apparently wore Christmas jumpers and attended in person, being split up into groups of six. The base for their gathering was said to be the “control centre” spearheaded by Cummings. Less than a mile away from Whitehall, Tory staffers also congregated in the basement of their party headquarters, which was being occupied by the campaign team of the Conservative London mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey. About two dozen staff were present, including one who now works for No 10, and initial reports said it was “raucous”, with a door broken during the celebrations. Bailey, a keen Lego fan, was given a kit of the plastic blocks as a present by staff. Attendees brought food and drink, and danced. But CCHQ bosses were said to be furious the following day, and members of Bailey’s campaign team who were at the party were temporarily barred from the building as punishment. The event took place on 14 December – the same day it was announced London would be going into tier 3 and even tougher restrictions on socialising.",News/Politics,The list so far of alleged Covid rule-breaking parties at Westminster,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/09/a-look-at-alleged-covid-rule-breaking-parties-across-westminster
12/10/2021,"Efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal have been hauled back from the brink of collapse as Tehran revised its stance after pressure from Russia and China and clear warnings that the EU and the US were preparing to walk away. The cautiously optimistic assessment came at the start of the seventh round of talks on the future of the nuclear deal in Vienna. It follows what was seen as a disastrous set of talks last week in which the US and the EU claimed Iran had walked back on compromises reached in previous rounds.  The Russian ambassador to the talks, Mikhail Ulyanov, said: “We managed to eliminate a number of misunderstandings that created some tension. Everyone confirmed their commitment to productive work [to restore the nuclear agreement].” Nevertheless, Joe Biden warned that the United States was preparing “additional measures” against Iran, amid lingering fears that the talks could still fail. “The president has asked his team to be prepared in the event that diplomacy fails and we must turn to other options,” said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, had warned that the talks represented the last chance for Iran to come back into compliance. Israel has been preparing military strikes in the expectation that the talks will fail, which would leave the Iranian nuclear programme unconstrained by any major multilateral agreement. European diplomats admitted on the eve of the talks that some factions in Iran wanted to pull out of the nuclear deal. But Russia claimed Iran turned up on Thursday with a revised approach and a willingness to negotiate on texts agreed during the first round of talks that ended in June, rather than a wholly new set of proposals on sanctions and compliance with the 2015 deal tabled by Iran last week. The Iranian chief negotiator, Ali Bagheri, also sounded more upbeat, saying: “What I felt today was different from what I had felt last Friday. I felt other parties have a more serious will to enter effective and result-oriented talks … What Iran proposed last week reflected its views on 20 June draft. We’ll continue talking.” The EU diplomats had been privately placing faith in Russia, and to a lesser extent China, privately persuading Iran that its new demands on a wider US lifting of economic sanctions relief were unrealistic. The battle over texts does not mean the remaining huge points of disagreement will be readily resolved, but last week the US was questioning whether the Iranian regime elected in June was interested in a deal or stalling as its domestic nuclear programme rapidly advanced.",News/World news,Iran nuclear deal pulled back from brink of collapse as talks resume in Vienna,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/09/iran-nuclear-deal-pulled-back-from-brink-of-collapse-as-talks-resume-in-vienna
12/10/2021,"Nightclubs have said they face rising costs and lost bookings amid confusion over Covid regulations for England being introduced at their busiest time of year. Bookings have been cancelled and visitor numbers have already dropped, club owners said.  The introduction of Covid passes in Scotland and Wales earlier this year hit takings by up to 30%, according to figures from the Night Time Industries Association. Peter Marks, the head of the UK’s biggest nightclub and bar operator, Rekom, which runs 42 venues, said the group would need to hire about three extra security staff at each venue to implement the measures, which make proof of two Covid vaccine doses or a negative lateral flow test mandatory for entry to nightclubs. “It is all a nightmare,” he said. “We need more staff in an age where security staff are hard to come by.” He said bookings at the group’s clubs in Scotland and Wales had taken a hit after mandatory Covid passports were introduced there. Aaron Mellor, the owner of 45 venues in the UK including Gorilla and Deaf Institute in Manchester, said the business had lost £300,000 of bookings in 24 hours as Christmas parties were cancelled. He said the government’s shift to asking those who could work from home to do so was having a “massive impact” as workers did not want to come into city centres if they were not in the office. Mellor said the potential lost business because of new vaccine requirements for clubs and the cost of taking on extra staff to deal with entry rules would only add to those difficulties. “The government has spent the last two months assuring us that Covid passports don’t work and they are not going to happen, and now they are happening in the busiest two weeks of the year. Yet again nightclubs are being penalised,” he said. All nightclubs, unseated indoor venues with a capacity of at least 500 people or crowded outdoor venues or events with at least 10,000 attenders will have to implement checks on over-18s from 15 December. Several club owners said they were concerned about trouble from young revellers as the new rules could be confusing. Nightclubs are defined as all venues playing music and with space for dancing and serving alcohol after 1am. Jeremy Joseph, the owner of G-A-Y in London, said he had three venues that would each now be operating under different rules. “It should be clear so all venues are treated the same. People don’t know the capacity of G-A-Y so they are not going to know what the rules are.” However, some major clubs said the new rules would not mark a change as they had long been asking their clientele for a Covid passport or a test. Luke Laws, the operations director of Fabric, a 1,500-capacity venue in central London, said it had been asking guests for Covid passports or tests since July, so there would be no change next week. “It’s been an extra cost and an extra layer but we’ve been able to make it work,” he said.",News/Business,Nightclubs in England warn confusion over Covid plan B rules could hit trade,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/09/nightclubs-in-england-warn-confusion-over-covid-plan-b-rules-could-hit-trade
12/10/2021,"Boris Johnson has picked the prominent Brexit campaigner Gisela Stuart for a senior role regulating appointments to the civil service – a “deeply inappropriate” decision given her previous political career, critics say. The former Vote Leave campaign chair is set to become the new first civil servant commissioner, leading a team who will scrutinise selections for top jobs in Whitehall.  While her appointment is conditional on scrutiny by the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, her choice as the preferred candidate will raise eyebrows given that Stuart urged people to vote for Johnson in 2019. The former Labour MP – who is now a crossbench peer – suggested at the last general election that those who did not traditionally back the Conservatives should do so to “deliver Brexit”. Two weeks before the end of the campaign, Stuart appeared at a press conference alongside the prime minister and said: “I urge other leave voters across the country to join me in voting for Brexit once more by voting for Boris Johnson on December 12, so that we can finish the job we have started, so that we can get Brexit done, and we can take back control.” Stuart will probably have a powerful say on appointments for departments’ permanent secretaries and other senior civil service jobs. Fleur Anderson, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said Stuart had had an “admirable career” but, given she is a former frontline politician, “there are huge questions marks over whether she can uphold the independence and integrity of this role”. Anderson called it “a deeply inappropriate appointment” and, referring to the review of government staff parties, she added: “On a day when junior civil servants are being hung out to dry on the actions of ministers, the neutrality of this position is more important than ever.” Alex Thomas, of the Institute for Government, said: “Asking a political figure, known to be a close ally of current senior ministers, to lead the very body that exists to ensure that the civil service can serve governments of any party, is a mistake. “It fails to recognise that perceived – as well as actual – impartiality is necessary for credibility in this role, will make civil servants less likely to speak honestly to ministers, raises concerns about how the impartiality principle in the civil service code is to be overseen, and encourages a creeping politicisation of the civil service.” Government sources admitted Lady Stuart’s selection could prove controversial, given the attention that public appointments processes have attracted. Recently the selection procedure for a new chair of the media regulator Ofcom was re-run because Johnson’s favoured candidate, the former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre, was deemed unsuitable. Stuart was already serving as a lead non-executive board member for the Cabinet Office, and previously served as a health minister from 1999-2001 in Tony Blair’s Labour government. Defending her selection, Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister, said she had “all the attributes, experience and independence of judgment needed to lead the Civil Service Commission highly effectively.” Stuart said it was a “great honour” to offered the role. “Building on the important work done by my predecessors, I am committed to maintain the excellence and impartiality of our civil service,” she said. Stuart will replace the former first civil servant commissioner, Ian Watmore.

12/10/2021,"New York’s famed Metropolitan Museum of Art is going to remove the name of arguably its most controversial donor groups – the billionaire Sackler family – from its galleries. The news comes in the wake of leading members of the US family, one of America’s richest, being blamed for fueling the deadly opioids crisis in America with the aggressive selling of the family company’s prescription narcotic painkiller, OxyContin.  The Met, which overlooks Central Park and houses some of the most famous and precious art works and antiquities in existence, announced on Thursday that it had reached an agreement with the descendants of two of the Sackler brothers behind OxyContin that seven named exhibition spaces at the institution would no longer carry the Sackler name. This includes the Temple of Dendur exhibition space, the ancient Egyptian temple, described by the Met as one of the iconic and most beloved works of art it houses, which is displayed in the Sackler Wing. The museum’s decision follows several years of hundreds of civil lawsuits and civil and criminal investigations into some members of the Sackler family who own the Connecticut-based company Purdue Pharma, which makes the powerful painkiller OxyContin. A New York bankruptcy judge in September approved a settlement by Purdue Pharma, including about $4.5bn from the company’s billionaire Sackler family owners, even though the decision is still being challenged in court and provoked outrage from many critics and campaigners. Some wanted to see those family members prevented from being shielded from further civil liability and also hoped some Sacklers would end up in prison, the likelihood of which faded when Purdue Pharma pleaded guilty to three criminal charges last year and paid $8bn in fines and damages. The Met announced that the families of the late Mortimer Sackler and the late Raymond Sackler “have mutually agreed to take this action” in order to allow the museum to further its “core mission”. A statement from the descendants of the two brothers said: “Our families have always strongly supported The Met, and we believe this to be in the best interest of the Museum and the important mission that it serves.” The statement added: “The earliest of these gifts were made almost 50 years ago, and now we are passing the torch to others who might wish to step forward to support the Museum.” Dan Weiss, president and chief executive of the museum, said that “the Sacklers have been among our most generous supporters” and referred to “this gracious gesture” by the family. At the height of the legal battle against the owners of Purdue Pharma in 2019, members of the Sackler family were being sued by multiple American cities, counties and states, with allegations in civil lawsuits including that “eight people in a single family made the choices that caused much of the US opioid epidemic” – via a “deadly, deceptive … illegal scheme” to flood the US with Purdue’s OxyContin. The American art photographer Nan Goldin devised and led a direct action protest at the Met in 2018 against Sackler philanthropy. She later took protests to institutions including the Guggenheim in New York, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Louvre in Paris, which had all benefited from Sackler money and displayed the family name, demanding that arts and academic institutions stop taking their dollars and also take down the name. The Met was slow to respond but later followed other institutions in saying it would no longer take Sackler gifts and now, ultimately, that it will remove the Sackler name from its premises.",News/US news,New York’s Met museum to remove Sackler family name from its galleries,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/09/new-york-met-art-museum-to-remove-sackler-family-name-from-galleries
12/10/2021,"The most important item in Go-Ahead’s annual accounts last year, it turns out, was buried on page 188. Note 27 gave brief details of a dispute with the Department for Transport about past profit-sharing calculations on the Southeastern rail franchise, where Go-Ahead had a 65% stake in partnership with French firm Keolis. The quarrel sounded dry, technical and the sort of thing that crops up from time to time on the railways. The accounts confidently asserted that should the DfT’s claim prove successful “the outflow of resources could be in the region of £8m”.  The small problem, however, keeps getting bigger. In September, the DfT stripped Southeastern of the franchise and accused the company of a “serious” breach of the franchise agreement. Go-Ahead apologised and said £25m – a far chunkier sum – had been returned. Now comes another grovelling admission of “serious errors” plus news that the two parents’ postmortem on events is so complex that the auditors, Deloitte, need extra time to finalise this year’s accounts. One uncertainty is how to estimate the size of the provision for the fine that DfT, almost certainly, will impose. The delay means Go-Ahead will miss its deadline for filing this year’s accounts, in turn provoking a suspension in trading in the shares on 4 January, an embarrassment for a public company. No investor likes to be stuck in the sidings, so you can understand why the shares reversed by 15%. The stock now stands at a 20-year low. The main way in which events could get worse for Go-Ahead is if the DfT decides to remove the remaining Thameslink franchise, a big commuter route. That feels unlikely since the failings relate solely to Southeastern, but the board has some explaining to do when the accounts eventually appear, which is expected to be before the end of January. This saga relates to taxpayer funding from 2014 and its seriousness seems to have been serially underappreciated. It’s not exactly a triumph, but it is a milestone: aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce, a corporate Covid sufferer via the collapse in air travel, is no longer burning cash every quarter. Between July and September, there was an inflow. The net tally for the whole of 2021 will still be an outflow of £1.6bn-ish, but 2022 should be positive. The effort has involved £1bn of cost-cutting, 8,500 job losses and a mammoth refinancing, but one can say now that the turnaround programme did what it was supposed to. Rolls can stay aloft even when “engine flying hours”, a critical contractual metric for income, are still only half the level of 2019. A couple of weeks ago, the news might have given fresh wings to the rally in Rolls’ shares that has been powered by the reopening of transatlantic air routes. Instead, Thursday’s 3% fall was a case of investors wondering if Omicron will cause a re-closing. No wonder chief executive Warren East was keen to talk up the idea that Rolls was now a “balanced” business. He has a point. The civil aerospace side grabs about 90% of the attention but, in its newly shrunken form, is only about one-third of the group. Meanwhile, the defence side has predictably sailed through the crisis and won high-profile work to upgrade the engines on the US air force’s B-52s. The Power Systems division is toiling against shortages of semiconductor chips but the order book is strong. Then there’s the new hope of riches from small modular reactors, a business East reckons one day could be bigger than the whole of today’s Rolls-Royce. That projection feels a little dreamy since the kit for the mini nuclear power stations is still at the assessment stage, but it is a reminder that Rolls works on extremely long cycles. After a scare, it seems to be moving in the right direction. You get thrills and spills with IPOs, but two of this year’s high-profile crop in the retailing sector have settled near their float prices. Dr Martens, the boot firm, and Moonpig, the online greetings card outfit, reported good-ish numbers on Thursday and both are just above their starting prices (4% and 7% respectively). The same can’t be said of Made.com, which served up a profits warning. Supply chain upsets and port blockages have played havoc with a business model that relied on just-in-time ordering, including from factories in Vietnam. Up to £45m of revenue, or 10% of the total, has been kicked into next year. Cue another year of losses in 2021, instead of the expected move into profitably. Therein lies the other reason why the shares are now 40% below their listing price. At £775m at launch, but no profits under its belt, Made was priced for perfection.",News/Business,"Suspending shares is embarrassing, the saga of Southeastern rail is serious | Nils Pratley",https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/dec/09/suspending-shares-embarrassing-saga-southeastern-rail-serious-go-ahead
12/10/2021,"Relations between France and Britain are strained because the current UK government does not honour its word, president Emmanuel Macron has said. Macron accused London of failing to keep its word on Brexit and fishing licences, but said France was willing to re-engage in good faith, and called for “British re-engagement” over the “humanitarian question” of dangerous Channel crossings, after at least 27 migrants drowned trying to reach the British coast.  “The problem with the British government is that it does not do what it says,” Macron told a news conference. He added however that there “had been progress” in the last weeks and that France wanted full cooperation with London. “I love Great Britain, I love its people. I have an overwhelming desire to have a government that wants to works with us in good faith,” he said. At an Élysée press conference to present France’s plans for its rotating presidency of the council of the European Union, Macron was asked about UK-French relations. There have been tensions about how to prevent further tragedy in the Channel as more people try to cross to claim asylum in the UK. He also claimed the UK had an economic model that relied on illegal labour, which was serving as a pull factor across the Channel. He said: “There is still an opaque system which has existed since the 1980s where the British economic model rests on the illegal labour of foreigners. If those situations aren’t dealt with by the British in good faith, we will always have this situation at our border where France has the goodwill to manage this point of passage. “We need to work in good faith together on the issue of migration.” He added: “If we want to solve that question of migration between our two countries, which has become a humanitarian question, we need British re-engagement.” Macron said men and women were “living in terrible conditions” on the Calais coast because they “wanted to reach British soil”. He said France had offered accommodation centres and tens of thousands of meals throughout the year, but people wanted to reach the UK. He deplored the fact that “there is no legal procedure on processing asylum rights” by the British at the Channel border, which meant people were risking their lives to find a way to reach the UK in order to live there. Macron said he hoped the row over the granting of British fishing licences to French fishers post-Brexit would be resolved before a French deadline on Friday, despite the UK denying that they are working to any such time framework. “There has been progress these past two weeks, progress, there has been a sincere re-engagement. I hope that new paths open up on it. I really hope that,” Macron said. Macron said that on defence, Britain had pushed for the Aukus security pact between Britain, Australia and the US that prompted Australia to cancel a contract with France to buy submarines. The cancellation of the submarines deal caused uproar in France, with accusations that its allies had stabbed it in the back. Macron for the first time publicly accused Britain of being “a fervent promoter” of the rival deal. “Can I ignore that the British were, it seems, the fervent promoters of a contract which deliberately fought against France’s interest in the Indo-Pacific to build an exclusive alternative vision?” he said. He said all of this did not amount to “the signs of flagrant friendship, to use an understatement”, but he said he wanted to work with the British government in good faith. Britain has said the Aukus deal was not intended to undermine its defence ties with France. Before France’s rotating presidency of the council of the EU, Macron called for new mechanisms to protect the EU’s borders and to provide emergency support for border crises, after thousands of refugees gathered on the border between Belarus and Poland in recent months. Europe “needs to ensure the protection of its borders”, he told a news conference, adding that France would push for reform of the Schengen area of passport-free travel between 26 countries in Europe. Macron, who is due to meet Germany’s new Social Democrat chancellor, Olaf Scholz, on Friday, also said the EU should reconsider its strict budget deficit rules as governments spend heavily to save their economies from the impact of Covid restrictions.",News/World news,Macron accuses UK of not keeping its word on Brexit and fishing,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/09/emmanuel-macron-uk-brexit-fishing-channel-crossings
12/10/2021,"Tropical forests can bounce back with surprising rapidity, a new study published today suggests. An international group of researchers has found that tropical forests have the potential to almost fully regrow if they are left untouched by humans for about 20 years. This is due to a multidimensional mechanism whereby old forest flora and fauna help a new generation of forest grow – a natural process known as “secondary succession”.  These new findings, published in Science, could play an important role in climate-breakdown mitigation and provide actionable advice on how to act next. They also suggest that it is not too late to undo the damage that humanity has done through catastrophic climate change over the last few decades. “That’s good news, because the implication is that, 20 years … that’s a realistic time that I can think of, and that my daughter can think of, and that the policymakers can think of,” said Lourens Poorter, professor in functional ecology at Wageningen University in the Netherlands and lead author of the paper. This idea of natural regeneration is frequently disregarded in favour of tree plantations, but according to Poorter, the former yields better results than restoration plantings. “Compared to planting new trees, it performs way better in terms of biodiversity, climate change mitigation and recovering nutrients.” The takeaway message is that we don’t necessarily need to plant more trees when nature is doing it by itself, Poorter said. For this study, more than 90 researchers from all over the world came together to analyse exactly how tropical forest regrowth takes place. They pored over data about forest recovery from three continents, 77 sites and 2,275 plots of land in the Americas and West Africa. From there, they evaluated 12 specific criteria, such as the soil, plant functioning, ecosystem structure and biodiversity, and more. They then modelled this data – without which they would have had to wait for over 100 years to see this happen in the real world – with a technique called chronosequencing, allowing them to infer long-term trends in forest recovery. The researchers looked in particular at what happens to tropical forest land that has been used for agriculture or farming and is then abandoned after a couple of seasons. They found that the old forest portion – including some fertile soil, any residual trees, seed banks and maybe stumps that can resprout – created a nourishing, interconnected ecosystem for new forest to start to grow. The researchers found that different aspects take, respectively, more or less time to recover to the levels of “old forest” before it was used. Soil takes an average of 10 years to recover to its previous status, plant community and animal biodiversity take 60 years, and overall biomass takes a total of 120, according to their calculations. But overall, tropical forests can get back to roughly 78% of their old-growth status in just 20 years. “That’s tremendously fast – surprisingly fast,” Poorter said. Of course, these are just calculations, and one of the constraints of chronosequence-based analyses is that every location analysed is assumed to have the same history and successional dynamics, said Eric Salas, a researcher in geospatial sciences at Central State University who was not involved in this study. So there can be some misinterpretation. “But understanding how secondary forests emerge naturally on abandoned agricultural lands is critical for ensuring biodiversity conservation,” Salas said, “particularly in tropical settings, where forests have complex structure and flora and fauna species are diverse.” The findings could be crucial for climate mitigation action in the future. “For example, the secondary forests are like teenagers. They soak up carbon like crazy and they empty your fridge,” Poorter said. “If you look at old people, they consume very little, and it’s the same as the old growth forest.” “What we want to advocate is: ‘Please value those secondary forests, and in areas where you can, please let those forests regrow back again naturally,” Poorter said. He mentions that a lot of the promises that have been made about planting trees in order to restore forests across the world are unrealistic. Most of the time, 30%-50% of those trees die, and they only pertain to a couple of species that cannot mimic the natural biodiversity of forests, according to Poorter. “My plea is to use natural regrowth where you can and plant actively and restore actively where you need to. There’s a case-by-case approach, and this all depends on the local conditions and also on the local needs of the people because they live in these landscapes.”",News/Environment,Tropical forests can regenerate in just 20 years without human interference,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/09/tropical-forests-can-regenerate-in-just-20-years-without-human-interference
12/10/2021,"Bosses at Matt Hancock’s local hospital have been severely criticised in an NHS report for their part in an “intimidating” bullying scandal exposed by the Guardian. The long-delayed review into West Suffolk hospital in Bury St Edmunds was ordered in January 2020 after the Guardian revealed that senior clinicians were subjected to an unprecedented demand to provide fingerprint samples as part of a management search for a suspected whistleblower.  A scathing 226-page report, by Christine Outram, chair of the Christie NHS foundation trust, found this tactic was “extremely ill-judged” and had a “disastrous” impact on staff morale and the reputation of the trust. The independent report published by NHS England on Thursday criticised the current chair of the trust, Sheila Childerhouse, and the senior management team, who have all since left, for having insufficient regard for patient safety and discouraging staff from raising concerns. Outram found that trouble began when a consultant anaesthetist doctor was seen injecting himself with drugs in November 2017, prompting some of his senior colleagues to raise the alarm. But she said these concerns were dismissed by the then medical director, Nick Jenkins, and the then director of workforce and communications, Jan Bloomfield, who allowed the doctor to carry on working as he continued to self-medicate. The report said it was “extraordinary” that concerns about the doctor were “ignored and rejected” by management. An anaesthetist, referred to in the report as Dr C, and known to be Dr Patricia Mills, was so concerned about the handling of the issues that she emailed Childerhouse “in confidence”. Instead of taking up the concerns, Mills’ email was simply forwarded to trust’s chief executive, Steve Dunn, who, with Bloomfield, summoned Mills to complain about her behaviour and accused her of trying to undermine the medical director. Outram said Childerhouse should have listened to Mills’ concerns and raised them with executives herself. Instead, she said: “The CEO [Dunn] and DWC [Bloomfield] quite wrongly mingled Dr C’s attempt to speak up with an attempt to address their perceptions about conduct.” Problems escalated when the self-injecting doctor was involved in the treatment of Susan Warby, who died in August 2018 after an operation at the hospital, which is in the constituency of the former health secretary, Hancock. An anonymous letter sent to Warby’s husband highlighted errors in her treatment. Outram said that rather than seeing the incident as a “red flag event” about patient safety, the trust’s executives saw it as a “malicious” attempt to undermine colleagues and launched a “highly flawed investigation” to find the culprit. She found that managers eventually whittled the number of suspects down to four, all of whom had raised concerns about the self-injecting doctor, including Mills. All felt “victimised”, Outram noted. They were then sent requests by management for fingerprints with a warning that failure to do so “implicates you as being involved in writing the letter”. The report said this “flawed and intimidating process damaged individual staff members and went against any semblance of an open culture in which staff were free to raise concerns”. It added: “The impact of these actions was nothing short of disastrous, not only for the staff directly caught up in the process, but for other members of the trust’s staff, the working environment more generally, and for the trust’s reputation internally and externally.” The incident contributed to the hospital in January 2020 becoming the first to be relegated by Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspectors from “outstanding” to “requires improvement”. Outram criticised the trust for failing to ask why the anonymous letter had been sent and instead focusing on who sent it. She urged it and other trusts to be “avoid jumping to any conclusions that an individual raising concerns is simply making trouble”. The trust said it took full responsibility for the failings and apologised to the staff involved. There has already been a management clear-out at the trust in advance of the report’s publication. Dunn, described as a “brilliant leader” by Hancock when he was health secretary, resigned in July. Jenkins stepped down in April, and its former chief operating officer, Helen Beck, also criticised in the report, retired last month. Bloomfield retired in March 2019. Craig Black, the trust’s interim chief executive, said: “We take full responsibility for failings and shortcomings around the handling of events leading up to and surrounding the whistleblowing and are truly sorry to the staff and families affected. “All our staff should feel confident to speak up without fear of retribution. We will use this report to make further changes to continue our work to create an open, fair and inclusive organisation that puts our staff and patient safety front and centre.” Dr Jenny Vaughan, chair of the Doctors’ Association, said: “Directors made the decision to focus all energies on the pursuit of the whistleblower – someone trying to speak up to raise the alarm. “It’s absolutely crucial that staff feel able to raise concerns without feeling bullied or intimidated, as that’s much safer for patients. Unfortunately, what happened here was the opposite.”",News/Society,Bosses at West Suffolk hospital criticised over ‘intimidating’ hunt for whistleblower,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/09/bosses-at-west-suffolk-hospital-criticised-over-intimidating-hunt-for-whistleblower
12/10/2021,"A record number of children were arrested on suspicion of terror offences in Great Britain in the last year, a development that investigators have linked to the shutdown of schools during the early stages of the pandemic. Figures released by the Home Office show there were 25 such arrests of under-18s in the 12 months to September, the majority in relation to far-right ideology.  This was an increase from 17 arrests the previous year. Under-18s accounted for 13% of all terror arrests last year, up from 8%. “We are very concerned that children are becoming an increasing proportion of our arrests,” said the deputy assistant commissioner Dean Haydon, the senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing. In February a 13-year-old neo-Nazi from Cornwall was found guilty of possessing bomb-making manuals and disseminating far-right materials online. Last week a 17-year-old from Derbyshire appeared before Westminster magistrates charged with possessing and sharing a terrorist publication. A trial is expected next year. Investigators highlighted the impact of pandemic-related school closures, arguing that educational settings help normalise behaviour, while schools regularly report cases of concern to Prevent, the government’s deradicalisation programme. Loneliness during lockdowns and the ease with which young people with time on their hands can seek out extremist material online when not being supervised are also factors driving the rise in numbers, police believe. Some extremists are using Covid conspiracy theories and online gaming channels as a means of recruitment. At the same time, restrictions on socialising and movement helped push down the number of adult terrorism arrests by 13%, reflecting wider lockdown-related falls in crime. Officers said they wanted parents to be more aware of the risks and to be prepared to call in Prevent, which few currently do. “Our research tells us that parents, family members and friends are the first to see the changes in behaviour which might indicate that a loved one is being radicalised,” Haydon said. “But currently just 3% of people we help through Prevent come to the programme because of concerns raised by those same people who know them best.” He advised parents to seek advice from the Act Early scheme. Counter-terrorism police said they had stopped 32 “late-stage” plots in the four years from 2017, an increase of one since September and four since March. Those uncovered by police and MI5 since March include three far-right plots and one leftwing, anarchist or single-issue plot – while the total of Islamist plots has remained unchanged at 18. There have been two terror attacks this autumn. In October the Conservative MP Sir David Amess was stabbed to death at his constituency surgery in Leigh-on-sea, Essex, in what is believed to have been an Islamist attack. A month later a man blew himself up in a taxi outside Liverpool women’s hospital for reasons investigators are yet to firmly identify. Reflecting the increasing focus on far-right activity, the number of white people arrested as terror suspects is now double the number of arrests of people from an Asian background. The Home Office data said 101 white people were apprehended, up 5%, and 49 people of Asian ethnic appearance, down 40%. Last month figures from Prevent covering 2020-21 showed that 310 people were referred to the programme by schools, colleges and universities because of far-right links, and 157 were referred because of vulnerability to Islamic extremism.",News/UK news,Record number of children in Britain arrested over terror offences,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/09/record-number-of-uk-children-arrested-for-terror-offences
12/10/2021,"Scotland’s national public health body is “strongly urging” people to cancel Christmas parties after a number of Omicron outbreaks linked to festive get-togethers. Dr Nick Phin, the director of public health science and medical director at Public Health Scotland (PHS), said: “There is much that we still need to learn about Omicron, but early evidence suggests that this new Covid variant is much more transmissible. The impact of this transmissibility has been seen in recent weeks, with a number of Omicron outbreaks linked to parties.  “We still need to learn more about the severity of disease caused by Omicron and the effectiveness of vaccines, but there are important things that we can do to help protect ourselves and our families now. To help minimise the further spread of Covid-19, and Omicron in particular, I would strongly urge people to defer their Christmas parties to another time.” Scotland recorded 3,196 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, and one case of the new variant, taking the total to 109. Almost half of all confirmed cases of Omicron in Scotland have been in the 20-39 age group, according to PHS figures released on Wednesday. Officials said they were not aware of any hospitalisations relating to the new variant. The agency’s weekly report said: “The somewhat younger age profile of the confirmed Omicron cases reflects the early detection of a large number of cases in events that typically attract people in these age groups.” One of the clusters in the central belt emerged around a Steps concert held at the Glasgow Hydro. At her regular Covid briefing on Tuesday, Nicola Sturgeon underlined the rate of increase of the Omicron variant, telling the Scottish public: “It is time for all of us to go back to basics.” Underlining the significance of this speed of increase, the first minister said: “The sheer weight of numbers of people who could be infected as a result of increased transmissibility and some immune evasion will create this pressure even if the disease the new variant causes in individuals is no more severe than Delta.” Sturgeon urged employers to ensure that all staff who could work from home would do so until at least the middle of January, and said people should do a lateral flow test “on every occasion” they intend to mix with others over the festive season, whether at work, socialising or going shopping.",News/UK news,Scots ‘strongly urged’ to defer Christmas parties after Omicron outbreaks,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/09/scots-strongly-urged-to-defer-christmas-parties-after-omicron-outbreaks
12/10/2021,"Dr Martens will raise the price of its famous footwear by £10 a pair next summer, after the shoemaker said increases in the price of raw materials and transport had added to its costs. The British brand said prices would rise in both Europe and the US as the cost of almost every aspect of its footwear had gone up – including the leather, metal eyelets, soles and shipping costs – because of demand for commodities and wage inflation.  “It is not one factor. We are just seeing general inflation in everything in every market,” said Kenny Wilson, the chief executive of Dr Martens, adding that the price rise was the first in two years. “We have been holding off on price increases, but we will need to [change that] as of autumn/winter next year.” Wilson said the price rises, which will add £10 to the classic 1460 eight-holed boots in the UK, taking it to £159 a pair, were likely to be implemented in July. Dr Martens revealed its plans as it reported a 16% rise in sales to £370m in the six months to 30 September. Pretax profits increased by 46% to £61.3m. The company, which listed on the London stock market in January valued at £3.7bn, said business had bounced back as stores reopened around the world and shoppers continued to buy from its website. It said problems with factory stoppages in Vietnam because of the pandemic had been overcome by building up stocks last year and switching to alternative factories in China and elsewhere. Wilson said the fashion for Dr Martens, and other hefty boots, in the UK was only a small part of the company’s growth story. “There is a long-term structural shift in the market. Women [going to work or for a night out] used to be wearing lots of heels. Now they are wearing trainers, Dr Martens and all kinds of footwear,” he said.",News/Business,Dr Martens to add £10 to price of its footwear because of rising costs,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/09/dr-martens-to-add-10-to-price-of-its-footwear-because-of-rising-costs
12/10/2021,"It is extremely tempting to dismiss the inquiry into last year’s Downing Street Christmas parties as a phoney exercise that will produce a bucket of Whitehall whitewash. After all, the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, who is conducting the inquiry, was handpicked by Boris Johnson to be his principal civil servant only last year. And few prime ministers, least of all one as slippery as Mr Johnson, are in the habit of assigning such inquiries to people who could make life difficult for them. Mr Case may also have played a role in the events he is investigating. Although the Cabinet Office says Mr Case did not attend any of the Christmas “gatherings”, it is not clear whether he was the source of the “repeated assurances” on which Mr Johnson relies to claim that there was no Christmas party in No 10 in 2020. Common sense suggests he may have been, and the paymaster general, Michael Ellis, twice failed to answer the question on Thursday. If he was indeed that source, and the inquiry concludes that there was no party, it will be a tainted finding. If he concludes that there was one, Mr Case’s own head may be on the block. For these reasons, it would have been better to give the job to someone more clearly independent.  Nevertheless, the Case inquiry should still be taken seriously – for the moment. It is the only show in town. It is investigating an event that has done enormous reputational damage to Mr Johnson’s government. It is also unquestionably a high-stakes exercise. Mr Case has it in his power to produce a report that could force the fall of a prime minister. Labour and the SNP have said Mr Johnson should resign if he has lied. Several Conservative MPs, while remaining loyal for the present, have said the same. The ConservativeHome pressure group, which also backs the prime minister, said on Thursday that an eventual vote of no confidence in him is now more likely than not. Critics should therefore continue to hammer away at the issues that Mr Case is probing, but should do so with their eyes open. The opposition parties did this in the Commons on Thursday with some effect. Downing Street was forced to refer two more parties that were potential breaches of Covid rules to the inquiry, along with the notorious one on 18 December. Others may be added to the list in future, according to the inquiry’s terms of reference, which were published on Thursday. This should happen now. There should be no wriggle room. The inquiry will have access to “all relevant records”. This must include WhatsApp messages. On Thursday, the Electoral Commission revealed that Mr Johnson had used WhatsApp in November 2020 to ask – successfully – for the Conservative party donor Lord Brownlow to provide more cash for the refurbishment of his Downing Street apartment. This contradicts Mr Johnson’s later claim to Lord Geidt, the independent adviser on ministerial interests, that he was unaware of Lord Brownlow’s role as the donor. Lord Geidt must now decide if he has been lied to. It is a big call. But Mr Case must also secure his inquiry against any similar concealments. He must move fast to prevent evidence being deleted. Following Allegra Stratton’s resignation on Wednesday, Mr Johnson may see this investigation as a device to identify further scapegoats. This is a real danger. Mr Johnson is fighting for his political life. That is why this investigation is a major test, not just of a desperate prime minister, but of the probity and independence of the civil service. Events have created a situation in which Mr Case holds the government’s credibility in his hands. He is ultimately a servant of the public and the law, not of the prime minister. He must carry out a serious investigation, not a sham.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Downing Street inquiry: serious not a sham | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-downing-street-inquiry-serious-not-a-sham
12/10/2021,"Work from home if you can; wear face masks when in public indoor spaces (except when eating, drinking or exercising); use the NHS app to prove you are vaccinated, or have recently tested negative, when entering venues with large crowds. New rules for England announced on Wednesday, and known as plan B, are intended to slow the spread of the new coronavirus variant, Omicron, with UK cases said to be doubling every three days or faster. They follow strong advice to get a booster, with the programme extended to everyone over 40 who had their previous dose more than three months ago, and a plan to recruit 10,000 more vaccinators. Concerns are high around levels of public compliance, with fears that the political row surrounding reports of parties in Westminster last winter, as well as more general fatigue concerning restrictions, could undermine people’s willingness to adjust their behaviour. The decision not to vaccinate children under 12 is also under attack, given that Covid case rates are highest in this age group and also among adults aged 35-49 – a cohort that includes many of these children’s parents. In the US and elsewhere, younger children are being vaccinated.  The government has a job to do in selling this new plan to the public (in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales nothing has changed). Given the pressures that the health service is already under in England, with almost six million people on waiting lists for surgery, it is important that the message to be careful, and to comply with rules on testing and self-isolation, cuts through. The bigger picture is that the world has fallen disastrously short when it comes to an international response to the pandemic. The elevated risk that follows from the virus’s continued circulation and evolution in unvaccinated populations must be confronted too. But while insisting on the benefits of the new measures, ministers must also face the problems that they are bound to cause. Not everyone can work from home and, as previously, the instruction to stay away from workplaces (where possible) will hit some employees and businesses hard. Theatres, for example, are in the midst of a revival after two extraordinarily difficult years. Other leisure and hospitality businesses were counting on the festive season to give a boost to revenue. Ditto the travel industry. Just because the government has not banned meeting friends in restaurants or going on trips, it does not mean that it has no responsibility for the consequences of cancellations. Statutory sick pay is set far too low and must be increased so that people whose employers do not top it up can afford to stay off work when they are ill or isolating. Businesses in the affected sectors are entitled to seek support. Ministers, including the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, must find ways to share the burden. Some, after all, have gained from the changes to lifestyles that Covid has brought about: home owners, property investors, and digital and delivery businesses. As throughout the pandemic, the impact is hugely uneven. While for some people and organisations the latest tightening of the rules brings disappointment or inconvenience, for others it signals serious disruption and real threat.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on tighter Covid rules: better safe than sorry | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/09/the-guardian-view-on-tighter-covid-rules-better-safe-than-sorry
12/10/2021,"Scottish ministers have promised record spending on cutting climate emissions and on housing improvements, in a budget that also put heavy emphasis on tackling poverty and low pay. Kate Forbes, the finance secretary, said the Scottish government would invest £2bn in low-carbon spending and record sums in childhood poverty measures, adult disability, free school meals, and free bus travel for all young people. There was also a record £18bn for the health service and social care.  Forbes said: “Today’s budget is a budget of choices, and we have chosen to tackle child poverty, to invest in the transition and to boost economic prosperity.” She promised that Scotland’s public sector workers would receive a minimum hourly rate of £10.50, above the national living wage, but opposition parties accused her of short-changing social care workers. Labour and the Liberal Democrats said the devolved government had a record amount of Treasury funding for next year, taking its budget for day-to-day spending to £40bn, yet had increased minimum pay for social care workers by only 48p an hour. Daniel Johnson, for Scottish Labour, said this was “an insult” and far below the rises to £12 and then £15 an hour that his party was proposing. Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said the increase was “derisory” and mirrored a real-terms cut in local government funding. Forbes accused both parties of promising to spend money that was not available. She said Labour’s £15-an-hour target would cost £3bn a year and add £1,000 a year to Scottish income tax bills. She said the draft budget, which has yet to be finalised by MSPs, delivered on a wide range of pledges, including partly offsetting UK government cuts to universal credit by providing £20 a week to all families in poverty with school-age children. It provides for moving to universal access to free school meals at primary school, and has nearly £2bn for adult disability payments and £544m for free preschool childcare. Forbes said that overall the government’s budget had fallen in cash terms, in part because Brexit and the Covid crisis had hit income tax receipts. While Scotland’s economy is now expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels next spring – far sooner than previously forecast – she said the negative impacts of Brexit were three times greater in Scotland than in London. The Scottish Fiscal Commission (SFC), an independent body similar to the Office of Budget Responsibility in London, said Scotland’s economy would underperform compared with the rest of the UK, and this would lower Holyrood’s forecast income tax receipts next year by £190m. The commission said Scottish income tax receipts would continue to grow more slowly in Scotland than in the UK as a whole. Even so, Forbes opted not to increase any income tax rates in Scotland, which are higher for higher earners than in the rest of the UK. She said the starter and basic rate bands would rise in line with inflation, but the threshold would be frozen for higher and top-rate bands. The SFC said freezing the higher rate threshold would increase tax income for the Scottish government by £106m because pay rises would bring more well-paid employees into that tax band. Its data also showed that much better economic performance this year had led to Scottish income tax receipts being £764m higher than expected in 2021, adding to Forbes’s spending options.",News/Politics,Scottish budget: record spend promised on tackling climate and poverty,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/09/scottish-budget-record-spend-promised-pay-climate-poverty
