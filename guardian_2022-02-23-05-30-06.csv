2/23/2022,"Manchester City’s Oleksandr Zinchenko has stated “no one will ever appropriate” Ukraine, as fears grow of war between his homeland and Russia. The utility player, who captained Ukraine at Euro 2020, spoke out after Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, stated he recognised the Russian-controlled territories in east-Ukraine, Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states. This has increased fears of a wider invasion of Ukraine by Russia.  Zinchenko, who played for Russian club Ufa before joining City in July 2016, has responded with a defiant message on his Instagram page. “My country belongs to Ukrainians and no one will ever be able to appropriate it,” the 25-year-old said. “We will not give it away.

2/23/2022,"Good morning. Vladimir Putin has ordered his forces to enter eastern Ukraine to perform “peacekeeping duties” and confirmed that Russia has recognised the expanded borders of the two Russian-controlled territories there, dramatically increasing the likelihood of a larger war in the near future. Britain and the US say Putin’s order amounts to the “beginning of an invasion”. The UK and EU will impose sanctions against Russians and entities and Germany has halted the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline approval in reaction to Russia’s “grave breach” of international law. The situation is moving fast – here’s what could happen next. AGL Energy says a premium of at least 30% on its share price will be needed for an extraordinary takeover bid by the tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and the Canadian investment firm Brookfield to succeed. Markus Brokhof, AGL’s chief operating officer, dismissed Cannon-Brookes’ proposal to shut the company’s coal-fired power plants by 2030 as unrealistic. Responding to the consortium’s offer of a 4.7% premium on the Friday share price, Brokhof said any investment banker would advise a full company takeover required the suitors “to offer a premium of 30-40%”.  NSW police are investigating a complaint after the Liberal MP Fiona Martin was allegedly confronted by a pro-Russia anti-vaccine mandate activist. Martin was labelled a “coward” and a “rat from a sinking ship” by self-styled “independent journalist” Simeon Boikov, who arrived with a camera in tow at the MP’s pop-up campaign stall at Cabarita Park on Monday. Martin claims that on Monday Boikov and his associates twice blocked her car as she attempted to leave Cabarita Park. The federal immigration minister Alex Hawke, failed to appear or send legal representation, to a NSW supreme court despite being named as the first defendant in a case that will determine whether the NSW Liberal party branch can continue to operate beyond 28 February. “It’s an extraordinary state of affairs that a federal minister would not appear in court,” one senior party member said. The United Australia party’s warning it will outspend its 2019 campaign in the looming election has prompted calls for urgent reforms to limit party expenditure. More Australian voters say the government should prioritise the population’s wellbeing over law and order, according to research, which also found nine in 10 respondents think governments should deliver services directly instead of outsourcing them to third parties.

Spheeris enters a world filled with runaways, drug addicts and squatters, where audience members spit on bands to signal some form of vile, violent appreciation.” As debate over the religious discrimination bill – and the right for religious schools to expel transgender kids – reached fever pitch this month, the Rev Josephine Inkpin carried on with the business of providing solace to those in need.

2/23/2022,"The opening goal came from a corner after four minutes, the game exactly where they wanted it already. There was a lead to defend and so they did, an hour passing before the second arrived. Breaking from their own area after a corner, wide spaces suddenly appeared before them and an open goal did too, the shot curling in from forty yards with the goalkeeper off his line. Two touches were all it took, the ultimate in efficiency. Then, in the last minute, another break and it was over. Five shots, three goals, a clean sheet: how very Atlético. Er, no. Not really, not any more.  On Saturday Atlético Madrid prepared for their meeting with Manchester United by defeating Osasuna 3-0 at El Sadar. It was the day Liverpool faced Norwich so of course Luis Suárez scored, and from miles out. Jan Oblak made four times as many saves as his opposite number. Sime Vrsaljko got away with a hand in an opponent’s face. And Atlético, lined up in a 4-4-2, had 37% of possession but neither wanted nor needed more. “The little details went against us,” Osasuna coach Jagoba Arrasate said. This was “Classic Atlético”, one newspaper said, but those two words weren’t the point; the truly key words were the other three they used: The, return, and of. That was what made it so significant, why central defender Stefan Savic insisted: “it was important for us to win again and do it with our DNA, which is to be strong at the back and effective up front.” But: is it? Still? And might Saturday’s win, their self-awakening, have been a one-off, another false dawn? The question that hangs over Atlético as the Champions League returns is not just how they are but who they are. On Tuesday, Ralf Rangnick talked about Atlético as an “emotional side” that “reflects the character of their manager”. Diego Simeone, he said, “has won trophies with a clear identity, with a recognisable playing style. I don’t think that has changed in the last years.” But that was already not entirely true, and now it is even less the case. At times, this can feel like a team suffering an identity crisis. Atlético are a side that has periodically evolved one way and then back again, if wanting to return to what they know, to revert to type. There have been shifts, glimpses of doubts about what they want to be, hints that players and manager do not always reach the same conclusion or believe in the same things. Last season they certainly didn’t play as they had in previous campaigns, Suárez the catalyst for them occupying different positions. They didn’t even play the same way at the start of the season as they did at the end, the season’s close almost absurdly epic. This season though, has been a step again, deeper into uncertainty. All those things you think you know about them, all those assumptions, the lines that are endlessly repeated: forget them. Certainly don’t trust them. Savic might will them to be real, Simeone too, but the truth is different. Osasuna was their first clean sheet away all season. Three days later, they were beaten at home by Levante, who are bottom. It was their 10th defeat but at least it was 1-0: in the previous four matches the team whose results once read like binary code ran: 4-3, 4-2, 3-2 and 2-2. That 4-2 is a loss at Barcelona when Atlético took an early lead. The 4-3 and 3-2 are consecutive last-minute comebacks at home, against Valencia and Getafe respectively, exhilarating evenings that also revealed flaws, the promise of revival proving fleeting. Both were followed by defeats and it is not just that they are losing, it is the way it is happening. For so long defined by their defence – a team that are tough, organised, ultra-competitive – Atlético are not good at the things Atlético are supposed to be good at. They have had twice as many 2-2 draws as 1-0 wins. They have already conceded more than in any of the ten seasons under Simeone, seemingly always on edge even when they win. In Europe, they were beaten 3-2 by Liverpool, having come back from 2-0 down, and only progressed on the final day with just their second win, goals in the 90th and 92nd minutes finally seeing them through in Porto. In Milan, they had needed a 97th minute penalty. No longer occupying a Champions League place, domestically last season’s champions are fifth, 15 points off the top. “You start to think: ‘why is this happening to us?’” Ángel Correa admitted. “So why is it?” he was asked, to which he replied: “I don’t know. I couldn’t explain it, but it’s a reality.” Marcos Llorente, their outstanding player last season from midfield, has been injured and when he has played has often done so at full back. Savic and José Mariá Giménez have been able to play together less than a third of the campaign, the former insisting: “we have been effected by injuries, which have made it harder for the manager to choose a system.” JOblak looks human, his save percentage plummeting. Antoine Griezmann has been injured. Suárez is a year older, the revenge that fuelled him running lower now, the astonishing effectiveness unsustainable. Koke has not reached the level he was at last season. Kieran Trippier has gone. “His exit has changed us for sure,” Savic admitted. But part of the problem may be exactly that: that they are champions. They then signed Rodrigo De Paul, Griezmann, and Matheus Cunha, many saying this was the best squad they had ever had, declaring them favourites. That was probably an exaggeration anyway and it changes things, even if only at some subconscious level. When it comes to group management too, and perhaps at mechanical level. From playing against the power, they had to administer abundance: the team has changed 32 times in 34 games. “For a team like Atlético it’s not easy to be champions,” Simeone said. “We created expectations and when the results didn’t arrive that hit us hard,” Correa told Marca. The margins are sometimes fine and fortune plays a part – last season, it is worth recalling, they were on edge all the way to the line, suffering and surviving Simeone talking about them entering the Suárez Zone. The underlying statistics are also not as bad as the results, but there is something not right, something missing. An edge, a sense of cause, a decisiveness. “We’re conceded the fewest shots but it felt like every shot went in,” Savic said. “There was also a relaxation defensively.” Simeone referred to a “lack of attention.” “When you win the league, lots of teams relax because they say ‘well, it’s happed’,” defender Giménez admitted. “Four new players came and the team relaxes a bit. Last season, games started and we would bite. This year, I see a slight relaxation in comparison. We were first to the challenges, the loose balls, we were aggressive in the areas, we defended games to the end. This year, that wasn’t happening. Why? Because we have a great team, but a great team is built on results too.” The results weren’t right, the route to them no longer clear, until Saturday offered a way to how they were. “We’re united. But it’s not words; it’s bodies that show that unity best, and in Pamplona we saw it. I have no doubt we’re on the right path,” Savic insisted. “I cling to the search for the team spirit we saw the other day,” Simeone said. “I hope we have that spirit tomorrow, because when we have that we compete well.”",Sport/Football,Can Diego Simeone recapture the ‘classic’ Atlético Madrid?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/22/can-diego-simeone-recapture-the-classic-atletico-madrid
2/23/2022,"Call me old fashioned, but I’d rather Boris Johnson wasn’t prime minister when Russia invaded Ukraine. Serious times call for serious leaders and Johnson is a profoundly unserious person. This isn’t about the lies and the parties: it’s about being led by someone who doesn’t aspire to be more than a music hall act. Albeit one with a limpet-like narcissism that keeps him clinging to the top job. That said, Johnson has had a goodish war so far. Partly because he has been so distracted by filling in police questionnaires that it’s only recently he seems to have noticed there was a situation developing in eastern Europe. But also because he has got some of the basics right. OK, so he looked a total wreck at the Munich security conference, arriving with the Toddler Haircut all over the place, his eyes stuck half shut, his tie askew and his shirt crumpled. But the content of his speech more or less hit the right mark. At least, he didn’t lose his place or ad lib about Peppa Pig World. Small victories and all that.  And when he came to update the Commons on Monday night’s invasion of Ukraine by Russian tanks, the Suspect at first looked as if he would again pull off the required trick of sounding like a grownup. He was heard in near silence as he ran through Vladimir Putin’s crimes and the failed attempts of western allies to talk him down from invading Ukraine. But now a line had been breached with Russian troops entering the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk. It was time to make Putin really sweat with sanctions that would hurt him, said Johnson. Only the sanctions he came up with – five relatively small Russian banks and three oligarchs – didn’t sound as if they would cause the Russian leader to lose a moment’s sleep. If that was the best the UK could come up with in response to the invasion so far, then Putin might as well make a bee-line for Kyiv. Compared to Germany’s decision to cancel the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, the UK’s response looked like pissing in the wind. Don’t panic, the Suspect, continued. Because this was just a graduated response. It was best to start with little sanctions. Sanctionettes in response to what was still only a minor invasion. That way we could build up to proper sanctions later. It didn’t seem to have occurred to Johnson that even as he spoke, Russian oligarchs were already moving their money out of UK assets that could be the subject of sanctions in the coming days and weeks. No matter. It was only friendly to give Russia ample warning. And he could be tough if he wanted to. If he could persuade Liz Truss to give up the tank she has on permanent call for a photo shoot, he would send it to the Ukrainian defence force. It could make all the difference. Still, this was a day for parliament to put on a united front and it did so. Though not quite in the way Johnson might have expected. There were no MPs on the Labour left to suggest that Nato might have been a bit provocative and it was time to give Russia the benefit of the doubt. It’s possible that Jeremy Corbyn had just that argument in mind but he arrived in the chamber too late to be called to speak and sat morosely on his own for about 15 minutes before leaving. So we’ll never know. Maybe he would have surprised us all by launching a blistering attack on Russian aggression. Instead that was left to Keir Starmer, who along with many other Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs, not only deplored Putin’s brutal authoritarianism but demanded stronger action. It was clear that Russia had invaded Ukraine so what was stopping the UK government from imposing tougher sanctions now? Sequencing sanctions was all very well but surely the baseline response should have been to exclude Russia from financial mechanisms like Swift and to ban trading in Russian sovereign debt? Labour’s Ben Bradshaw observed that the three individuals who had been sanctioned had all been put on a US sanctions list four years ago. So they were all old lags at this kind of thing and the new penalties imposed on them wouldn’t make the slightest difference. Surely there must be some others among the dozens of oligarchs close to Putin who were worthy of some kind of sanction? Johnson hummed and hawed. He was fairly sure Roman Abramovich had been sanctioned. If only. As it turns out – Abramovich has never been sanctioned. Pity, as the thought of Chelsea being stripped of its assets and relegated to League Two could unite the entire country. All but 45,000 of it. And they don’t count. Besides, you had to remember that if you used up your sanctions all at once then you might not have any left for later. Then again, if you didn’t – as countless other MPs pointed out – you merely encouraged Putin to go for broke. Caroline Lucas and Labour’s Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi cut to the chase. Was the prime minister sure that weak sanctions had nothing to do with Russian Tory party donors, oligarchs playing tennis with Tory ministers, appointing Russians to the House of Lords or Russian interference in UK elections? Absolutely not, the Suspect insisted. Perish the thought. One mustn’t get carried away by Russophobia. He only played tennis with the very nicest and very richest Russians. As you do. With that Johnson scarpered for the exit, wondering how he had managed to let himself be outflanked by the entire Commons.

2/23/2022,"Vladimir Putin has said that Russia will support the territorial claims of its proxy states in east Ukraine, dramatically increasing the likelihood of a larger war in the near future. The Russian president’s move towards escalation came on the same day as the US, EU and UK unveiled new packages of sanctions intended to deter him from all-out war.  Joe Biden was expected to announce restrictions on US technology exports to defence-related industries in Russia. EU foreign ministers agreed to sanction 27 Russians and entities, all members of the Russian Duma, the lower house of parliament, as well as banks and the defence sector, while limiting Russian access to European capital markets. The UK imposed asset freezes on five Russian banks and three wealthy Russians, but left unscathed the major UK-based oligarchs, an issue that has been a point of friction between Washington and London. Boris Johnson said it was only “the first barrage of what we are prepared to do”. By far the biggest step was taken by Germany, whose government had been among the most cautious in its rhetoric in the run-up to the invasion. Berlin suspended the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia, which has been fully built and was awaiting certification. Putin however, enlarged the scope of Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine. Speaking at a press conference, he said that Russia recognised the borders claimed by the self-proclaimed “people’s republics” which are well beyond the current front line and include substantial territories, including towns and cities still under Ukrainian government control. “We have recognised the independence of these republics, which means we have recognised all their fundamental documents, including the constitution. And the constitution prescribes the borders within the Donetsk and Luhansk regions at the time when they were part of Ukraine”, Putin said. Russian troops have already crossed into Ukraine in the Moscow-controlled territories up to the front line. Putin’s legalistic remarks implied they could go further in the name of defending their proxy states. Any Ukrainian response could then be used to justify a full-scale, multi-pronged invasion of the kind the US and its allies have been predicting. Russia said on Tuesday it was evacuating its diplomats from Ukraine, citing concerns about their safety. Putin also received approval from his Federation Council on Tuesday to use the armed forces abroad. The decision indicated that they would be used in a “peacekeeping” force in south-east Ukraine but has raised concerns that Russian legislators have just green-lighted an all-out assault on Ukraine. Putin last appealed to the Federation Council for a similar authorisation when he intervened in the Syrian conflict in 2015. He has never requested a similar authorisation to send troops to Ukraine, despite evidence that Russian forces have, in fact, fought there since 2014. Putin suggested further military action would be unnecessary if Kyiv negotiated with Moscow over “difficult questions”. He laid out three demands of the Ukrainian government: recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, seized in 2014; renunciation of Ukraine’s aspirations to join Nato; and partial demilitarisation. The government in Kyiv is unlikely to accept any of Putin’s ultimatums, which would involve surrendering a large swath of territory. Before Putin spoke, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukraine president, addressed the country saying: “We will give nothing away, we fear nothing and nobody.” On a visit to the Pentagon during a trip to Washington, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Putin’s aim was not about Luhansk and Donetsk but “the destruction of the Ukrainian statehood”. “We will not fall into provocations arranged by Russia,” Kuleba said. “But if the war is imposed on us by President Putin, we will be defending ourselves”. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the crisis was “the most dangerous moment for European security in a generation.” “We commend Ukraine for its restraint in not responding to Russia’s repeated provocations,” Stoltenberg said “We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and its government.” In Kyiv, there was a growing sense that Russia had decided to escalate military conflict, and the only remaining question was scale. “Unfortunately, there are more and more confirmations that such a decision by Russia is a reality. As Russia abandons diplomacy as a tool for resolving the conflict, Ukraine has no choice but to prepare to defend its territory,” said Bohdan Yaremenko an MP and member of parliament’s foreign policy committee.",News/World news,Likelihood of war escalates as Putin promises to support proxy Ukraine states,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/likelihood-of-war-escalates-as-putin-promises-to-support-proxy-ukraine-states
2/23/2022,"Widening sanctions against Moscow could result in higher energy bills for a swathe of UK businesses if a key Russian-owned supplier is blacklisted, the UK’s energy trade body has confirmed. Gazprom Energy, a subsidiary of Russia’s state owned gas and oil giant, has been one of the largest suppliers of gas for UK businesses since 2010, according to energy consultancy Cornwall Insight, which said the firm accounts for about 20.8% of the market.  While Downing Street has so far only imposed asset freezes on five Russian banks and three high net worth individuals as part of its retaliation over Moscow’s threat to Ukraine, the UK has given itself powers to extend those sanctions to target other key industries including the energy sector. A larger package of UK sanctions against Moscow, which is being coordinated with the US and EU, will be implemented if a full-scale invasion of Ukraine takes place. That could impact companies such as Russia’s state-owned gas giant Gazprom and subsidiaries such as Gazprom Energy, which provides gas and electricity to factories, businesses and public sector customers across the UK. According to its latest annual report, it supplied gas to 178,000 sites across the country in 2020. A subsidiary of Gazprom’s marketing and trading arm, the gas it supplies to UK customers comes from a “variety of sources and countries” including Norway and Qatar. The firm declined to confirm the proportion secured from Russia. The UK’s energy trade body has warned that any further disruption to the supply during an existing crunch could spell trouble for customers. “With both domestic and business customers already facing steep bill increases as a result of record gas prices on the wholesale market, further disruption to the market and supplies would be a big concern if it increases prices further,” a spokesperson for Energy UK said. Unlike domestic energy users, there is no price cap for business customers across the UK. Companies have suffered rising bills following a global gas supply crunch that emerged as economies began to rebound after the Covid-19 slump. Gazprom Energy first entered the UK market when it bought supplier Penine, which had just 600 customers at the time, in 2006. It did not confirm the number of UK business customers it currently serves, and declined to comment on the potential impact of UK sanctions. The gas supplier employs about 290 people at its head office in Manchester, according to its website. Its parent company is responsible for about 13% of global gas production. Although a further escalation of tensions between Russia and the west would have a far more significant impact in mainland Europe – including Germany where Russian gas imports account for 40% of the supply – it could also indirectly push up prices on the wholesale market. Economists warn this is likely to have a knock-on impact for British firms and households. Britain consumes about 74bn cubic metres of gas each year, or about 1,100 cubic metres per person, making it one of Europe’s heaviest consumers per capita. About half is imported, mostly from Norway which supplies a third of UK gas. Russia was the fourth largest market for UK gas imports in 2021 according to official figures from the Office for National Statistics. Ranked after Norway, Qatar and the US, Britain bought almost £1bn of Russian gas, or about 4.9% of total UK imports. Speaking last month as tensions mounted, Will Webster, energy policy manager for the industry lobby group Oil and Gas UK, said: “If the Russians reduce deliveries of gas to Europe, then it has to come from somewhere else, most likely as shipments of liquefied natural gas. That will increase competition for supplies, driving up prices and consumer bills even more. Conversely, any additional gas we produce ourselves will help alleviate this process.” Jamie Maddock, an equity research analyst at investment management firm Quilter Cheviot said the impact of potential sanctions on the wider gas market would depend on the “severity and breadth of any sanctions beyond what’s already been announced, and then if it instils a response in Russia.” “So far, the government’s sanctions are focused on certain oligarchs within Putin’s inner circle and various Russian banks,” he said. “There is little impact on energy companies, Gazprom included, though this could well change.”",News/Business,Further sanctions against Moscow could raise energy bills for UK firms,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/further-sanctions-against-moscow-could-raise-energy-bills-for-uk-businesses
2/23/2022,"The first glimpse of a Partygate questionnaire confirms that Downing Street insiders are being questioned under police caution – and asked if they have a “reasonable excuse” for attending lockdown-busting gatherings. Boris Johnson has already returned his replies to the Metropolitan police’s questions, and is believed to have argued that he attended social events in No 10 in a work capacity.  A copy of one of the official questionnaires, obtained by ITV, shows it includes the police caution: “You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you subsequently rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.” Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “This is an embarrassment that for the first time in UK history we have a PM interviewed under police caution.” As well as asking the recipient to confirm their attendance at a specific event, the leaked questionnaire shows they were also asked: “What was the purpose of your participation in that gathering?” and “did you interact with, or undertake any activity with, other persons present at the gathering. If yes, please provide details.” Recipients were offered the opportunity to give a “lawful exception” or “reasonable excuse” for attending. Johnson is understood to have hired a lawyer to help him draw up his responses, which Downing Street has confirmed were submitted before the deadline of last Friday. Questionnaires are still being sent to some officials. The Met will then have to decide whether to impose fixed penalty notices for breaking lockdown rules. The Met investigation into 12 social events, several of which the prime minister is known to have attended, was triggered by evidence uncovered by the senior civil servant Sue Gray, whose full report on her inquiry will not be published until the police have completed their work. Johnson’s allies are convinced he has a justification for attending events that took place at No 10, which is his home as well as his workplace. He initially denied reports that parties had been held in Downing Street, telling MPs: “All guidance was followed completely.” Receiving a fixed penalty notice for breaching rules that he himself drew up is regarded as unacceptable to many backbenchers, and would be likely to prompt more letters calling for a vote of no confidence. If 54 such letters are submitted to the chair of the 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, a vote of no confidence in Johnson would be triggered, and if he lost such a vote, his premiership would be over.",News/Politics,Leak confirms Partygate questionnaire includes police caution,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/22/leak-confirms-partygate-questionnaire-includes-police-caution
2/23/2022,"Harriet Harman has called for a full investigation into how a housing association failed to realise that a tenant had apparently been left dead in her south London flat for more than two years despite repeated calls from neighbours. The body of a woman, named locally as Sheila Seleoane, 61, was found in the Peabody housing association flat in Peckham on Friday after neighbours complained about the noise of a balcony door banging during Storm Eunice.  The same neighbours said they had told staff at the housing association in the late summer or early autumn of 2019 that they were worried by the appearance of flies, maggots and a disturbing smell. They said an employee from the housing association opened corridor windows but otherwise their complaints were brushed off. “We were told that the housing association didn’t deal with flies and maggots – they said it was an issue for pest control,” said a woman who lives in the flat beneath where the woman died. Other neighbours said they tried to stop the smell coming into their flats by putting old clothes on the floor by the front door to seal the gap. “We called them many times. It’s shocking that our complaints were handled so badly,” said a neighbour whose flat stands opposite that of the dead woman. “No one listened to us.” Both residents asked not to be named. The victim has not been named formally but local media reported that she was Sheila Seleoane. Police said her death was being treated as unexplained but not suspicious. Harman, the Labour MP for Camberwell and Peckham in south London, said: “You would like to think that this kind of thing wouldn’t happen in a block of flats in a busy part of London. It is shocking – awful for the neighbours and for the woman’s relatives. It raises a lot of questions for Peabody and for the police and for the council. “Peabody say they were contacted in 2020, but the neighbours say they contacted them much earlier. There is a clear discrepancy between what the housing association are saying and what the neighbours have said. We need a prompt report from Peabody and the police. What is already clear is that tenants weren’t listened to. We will establish what needs to be done to prevent this from happening again.” In a letter to local councillors, Wells Chomutare, Peabody’s assistant director of residents services for the south region, wrote: “We are fully investigating what happened. From our initial search our neighbourhood manager visited when concerns were first raised by neighbours. This was in October 2020. “When we couldn’t contact the resident we contacted the police, who reported that everything was fine. The case was then closed. We made several other attempts to call, visit and contact the resident throughout the two years.” A Peabody spokesperson said: “This is a desperately sad situation and we understand that people want answers. Our early inquiries show that we treated residents’ concerns extremely seriously when they were reported to us. We made repeated attempts to contact Ms Seleoane and called the police to raise concerns for her welfare in 2020. “Our records indicate that the police then visited the property and reported to us that our resident was safe and well. We are now working with the police and other partners to establish how this happened as part of a full investigation into all of the circumstances. We need to understand what went wrong so this can never happen again.”",News/UK news,MP calls for inquiry into failure to find dead woman in London flat,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/22/mp-calls-for-inquiry-into-failure-to-find-dead-woman-in-london-flat
