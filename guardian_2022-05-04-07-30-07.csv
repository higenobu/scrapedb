5/4/2022,"Megan James, who lives near Nimbin, was the first of many speakers to take the microphone at a university lecture theatre in Lismore for the first community hearing of the 2022 New South Wales flood inquiry on Tuesday evening. “I’m the voice in the hills, but we’re no longer heard,” James said. She told of how farmers once phoned Lismore to warn that their rain gauges were filling and a flood was on the way; now the town relied on official forecasts that weren’t always accurate. The lack of warning from authorities of the impending floods, on 28 February and 30 March, was one of the most prevalent themes at the town hall-style meeting, at which the inquiry’s leaders, Professor Mary O’Kane, an engineer and scientist, and Mick Fuller, the former NSW police commissioner, explained they had come to listen, not provide answers. In the words of another speaker: “There was no real clear warning that it was going to be as bad as it was.” One northern rivers resident said he hadn’t come to blame State Emergency Service volunteers or the local council, but their modelling systems appeared to be failing. An array of ideas was proffered from the floor. Blocks and tackles could be used to secure houses in flood plains and wetlands of native flora planted to divert water away from residential areas, because “lots of people still want to stay in this place”. Flood mitigation could include dredging Lismore Wilsons River and restoring it to the deep channel once used by ships – today it’s barely fit for a dingy. First Nations land management practices needed to be adopted. The myriad of potholes in the region should be highlighted by white paint, because they were impossible to see at night on wet roads, and there were also calls to investigate whether the upgraded Pacific Highway had exacerbated flooding in some places. Some suggested flood-zone houses should have mandatory roof hatches, like skylights, to prevent people in attics being drowned by rising waters. There were multiple calls for the insurance system to be overhauled, community communications systems to be strengthened with satellite, and a testimony about the impact on wildlife. There were callouts for improved drainage and building flood-proof, because “clearly our infrastructure can’t handle this” and “disaster planning must be incorporated into regional planning”. There were stories of trauma – the neighbours were screaming; children saw their pets drown. One woman referenced a friend who perished while trying to be saved on Facebook, and a miraculous rescue tale – someone was pulled from a strong torrent by a string of Christmas lights. There was even laughter when Byron Bay councillor Mark Swivel lamented the national media’s focus on Byron’s inundation– “the flood came to Byron because apparently water likes linen”. The only agitation was when a woman spoke about being traumatised by the floods, which she attributed to climate change and a reliance on fossil fuels. She was met with applause and a couple of boos. Stories were told from an array of perspectives. Helen Coyle, who lives with a disability, described being stuck in Ballina, unable to return to her Lismore home because the roads were cut. She went to the Ballina hospital for help but said staff chastised her for travelling with insufficient money. She is calling for hospital staff to be kitted with the phone numbers for organisations that can support people with disabilities displaced by severe weather events. A subsequent indignity, she said, was that the floods have robbed Lismore of public disabled toilets, only portaloos. Are the disabled expected to “shit themselves”? Another Lismore resident called on flood clean-up volunteers to be trained in what is salvageable because well-intentioned volunteers had thrown away her son’s two prosthetic legs. Bruno Ros, a vet specialising in large animals, spent the first post-flood days on helicopters looking for stranded livestock and visiting isolated farming properties. “Plenty of people were on the ground, barking, screaming and pleading for help,” he said after the inquiry, “and for me as a vet the Department of Primary Industries was just inaccessible. I begged for assistance. It arrived seven days after the floods, seven days too late.” Dr Cam Hollows, a doctor on the ground in Coraki, recounted working for 40 hours and treating 60 patients in the aftermath. “We’ve repeated every single mistake of the bushfires,” he said. Lismore Labor MP Janelle Saffin agreed: “Government agencies weren’t prepared, and they need to ramp up really quickly because that’s what disasters need, but they haven’t done that.” Mark O’Toole, from Bungawalbin, said he asked members on a community Facebook page if anyone had been successful in securing a government business grant: “So far I’m up to 890 comments and nobody has got one”. There are around 100 farmers just in his town, he said, and “the money needs to start flowing now, not in six months or 12 months.” A woman fought back tears as she described families with children still camping in backyards. Another outlined simple wishes: “I’d just like a cupboard for my undies, a pantry for my food.” For more than two hours the Lismore crowd listened in near silence – a demonstration of forbearance and patience from a community that had already endured so much. The NSW flood inquiry will hold its next public hearing at the Tumbulgum Hall in the Tweed Shire on Wednesday. It is required to report to the premier by 30 September and is open to submissions from any member of the public, which can be made online, via email, post or phone.",News/Australia news,"Trauma, disbelief and plenty of ideas shared at NSW flood inquiry hearing in Lismore",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/04/trauma-disbelief-and-plenty-of-ideas-shared-at-nsw-flood-inquiry-hearing-in-lismore
5/4/2022,"Joe Biden on Tuesday told assembly-line workers at an Alabama factory that the weapons they are crafting are going into “the hands of Ukrainian heroes” on the front lines of the effort to repel Russian forces. The US president praised the employees of the Lockheed Martin plant that manufactures Javelin anti-tank missiles, saying their work was critical to the Ukrainian war effort and to the defense of democracy itself. “You’re making a gigantic difference for these poor sons-of-guns who are under such enormous pressure and firepower,” Biden told the workers from a podium flanked by the Javelin missile launchers. From a sprawling compound in Troy, Alabama, to the battlefields in Ukraine, the anti-tank missiles have helped equip the Ukrainian forces, the president said. “You’re making it possible for the Ukrainian people to defend themselves, without us having to risk getting into a third world war by sending in American soldiers fighting Russian soldiers,” Biden said, adding of the Ukrainian military: “Quite frankly, they’re making fools of the Russian military in many instances.” ""Quite frankly, they're making fools of the Russian military in many instances,"" Pres. Biden says of Ukrainian troops, during remarks at a Lockheed Martin facility that makes Javelin anti-tank missiles. pic.twitter.com/SXXythKsWr Speaking after a tour of the factory line, Biden urged Congress to approve an additional $33bn in aid for Ukraine as the besieged nation continues to battle Russian forces in the east and south. Biden said that funds spent on bolstering Ukrainian security so far was “a direct investment in defending freedom and democracy itself”. He then added: “Because if you don’t stand up to dictators, history has shown us, they keep coming. Their appetite for power continues to grow.” Nodding to concerns from some lawmakers that the steady flow of weapons to Ukraine has depleted US stockpiles, he said the assistance includes funding to “replenish our own stock of weapons to replace what we’ve sent to Ukraine”. “This fight is not going to be cheap,” he said. “But caving to aggression would even be more costly.” Support for Ukraine has largely been approved on a bipartisan basis. But the latest request, which includes $20bn for security and military assistance, represents a significant increase in the US’s investment in the effort to defeat Russia in Ukraine. Demand for the Javelin missiles remains high. According to US and Nato officials, Ukrainian forces have used the system to devastating effect against Russian tanks and artillery since the conflict began in late February. So far, the US has transferred over 5,000 Javelin missiles to Ukraine from US stocks and nearly 500 more from allies and partners, according to the White House. Lockheed jointly produces the weapons with Raytheon Technologies, which separately produces Stingers. The Alabama facility Biden toured employees approximately 600 workers and is capable of producing roughly 2,100 Javelin missiles per year. Biden also called on Congress to quickly pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act, a sprawling legislative package designed to boost US competitiveness with China by bolstering American manufacturing and strengthening supply chains. On the tour, Biden said he learned that each Javelin requires more than 200 semiconductors, the production of which have been strained by pandemic-era supply shortages. Boosting American production of semiconductors, he said, was not only a vital step toward rebuilding domestic manufacturing and lowering the cost of goods, but critical for national security.",News/US news,Biden praises Lockheed workers for making weapons for ‘Ukrainian heroes’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/03/biden-lockheed-martin-weapons-ukraine-russia
5/4/2022,"If, when you saw the title of this documentary, The Man With a Penis on His Arm (Channel 4), your first thought was: “Wait – like the mouse with the ear on its back? But a man and a penis and an arm?” the answer is ineluctably: yes. Just like that. Malcolm, now 45, lost his penis 12 years ago and has had a replacement growing on his arm and awaiting transplant for the past six. As he put it, he was “an ordinary man doing everything a normal man does”. He had a job, “a nice partner” and was living “a man’s life, bringing in the money, putting food on the table”. The arrival of a baby, he says, disrupted things – though we later find out that the death of his father, to whom Malcolm, after time in foster care, had grown very close, killed “the happy part of me” – and he ended up on the streets and addicted to drink and drugs. An attempt to lance an abscess himself resulted in blood poisoning. His fingers and toes went black. So, too, did his penis. “Then I went to the toilet and it fell off,” he says, matter-of-factly. The interviewer’s journalistic objectivity falls momentarily away. “Your … your penis fell off?” he says. “Gone,” says Malcolm, beginning to walk out of shot. “See ya.” There is no getting away from the fact that any documentary entitled The Man With a Penis on His Arm is going to invite moments of levity. It’s not that the narrator of Malcolm’s story, Paul McGann, doesn’t do a fine job of neutrally delivering lines such as: “No one has ever spent as long living with a penis on his arm.” But if you, as a viewer, don’t feel the urge to side-eye someone and murmur: “You don’t say?” then … well, I would admire but also, in some profound way, mistrust you. Ditto at moments such as the one where, his forearm appendage swinging free, Malcolm points out that it makes it hard to reach the back hob. It almost makes you proud to be British. Still, it is the deep sadness of Malcolm’s tale – and the six years of waiting for his arm-penis to be relocated is only one part of it – that dominates. The pandemic added to the delay, but, presumably out of kindness to Malcolm, it is never made fully clear why he has had to wait so long for his operation. We are, however, given enough information to infer that his relationship with alcohol, and the difficulty of attending all the necessary appointments for surgery without support from friends who prove unreliable, are maybe something to do with it. There are two other subjects in the film: Anik, born with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome, which resulted in an underdeveloped penis; and Lee, who was born without a penis and only obtained one through surgery at the age of 42. Anik, too, has had his phalloplasty. We follow him as he undergoes yet another operation on his poor groin (his doctor doesn’t recognise his face, Anik notes), this time to reposition the internal hydraulic equipment that will enable him to have erections. There are many fascinating questions raised by all three stories, about masculinity, what it takes to be a man, what it means to be without a penis in a patriarchy and a phallocentric culture, but they are only rarely examined. Lee, for example, seems to have been born male but, in the absence of a penis, was raised as a girl (it’s unclear for how long, but for at least the first few years of his life). But, he says: “I knew I needed a penis from six or seven.” What this might tell us about biological imperatives, maleness v masculinity is not explored, nor the complicating effects of abuse by his father “before I was five”. Anik, surrounded by a supportive family and seemingly possessed of a thoroughly optimistic spirit, took an overdose at 14 as the trials of puberty seemed insurmountable. At a time when people are questioning like never before what it means to live in a male or female body, it seemed like a missed opportunity not to ask more from people with rare perspectives on the issues. But it was, really, Malcolm’s story – which, thank God, has a happyish ending. His surgeon offers him a last chance and he takes it. His penis is now back where it belongs. He shows us the results, but it’s his brighter affect that tells us what we really need to know. He feels better. “Six years with a cock on me arm,” he says in wonder. “Something to tell the grandchildren, isn’t it?”",Arts/Television & radio,The Man With a Penis on His Arm review – TV that makes you proud to be British,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/03/the-man-with-a-penis-on-his-arm-review-tv-that-makes-you-proud-to-be-british
5/4/2022,"A Russian state TV report that simulated a nuclear attack launched off the coast of County Donegal has caused consternation in Ireland. Dmitry Kiselyov, a pro-Kremlin presenter on Channel One known as “Vladimir Putin’s mouthpiece”, on Monday showed a video of an underwater missile wreaking apocalypse on Ireland and the UK. Russia could “plunge Britain into the depths of the sea” using an unmanned underwater vehicle called Poseidon, he said. “The explosion of this thermonuclear torpedo by Britain’s coastline will cause a gigantic tsunami wave up to 500 metres high. Such a barrage alone also carries extreme doses of radiation. Having passed over the British Isles, it will turn what might be left of them into a radioactive desert.” The report did not name Ireland but the simulation showed its destruction along with Britain, which has angered the Kremlin by supplying weapons to Ukraine. Irish politicians condemned the report. Neale Richmond, a legislator with the ruling Fine Gael party, called for the expulsion of Russia’s ambassador to Ireland, Yury Filatov.

The Russian embassy in Dublin said in a statement: “The views and presentations in the TV show are that of the editors. The official position of Russia has always been that there can be no winners in a nuclear war and that it must never be unleashed.”",News/World news,Ireland condemns Russian TV for nuclear attack simulation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/ireland-condemns-russian-tv-for-nuclear-attack-simulation
5/4/2022,"Ronnie O’Sullivan has warned his snooker rivals he may keep playing at the highest level until his mid-50s as the dust settles on another world championship victory. O’Sullivan equalled Stephen Hendry’s modern-era record of seven Crucible titles by defeating Judd Trump on Monday, further erasing any doubt to the debate that he is snooker’s greatest player. But there is no sign of the 46-year-old slowing down. He has ended the season as the world No 1, and his seventh world crown was perhaps his most impressive yet, with O’Sullivan losing only one session all tournament as he became the oldest world champion in Crucible history, setting a personal record of 15 centuries for the tournament in the process. O’Sullivan had previously said he envisaged playing for three more years at the top, but has now hinted he could carry on beyond that. “I could probably play to my mid-50s if I wanted to,” he said. “The tournaments like this will be a bit of a strain, there might not be much chance of winning them, but everything else, why not? I still enjoy being on the circuit, I’m having fun with it.” Both Trump and Hendry backed O’Sullivan to go beyond seven world titles in the aftermath of his latest victory, even if O’Sullivan himself stressed he is not concerned with accolades or being regarded as the greatest player in history. But that position is now almost certainly secure after another landmark victory in Sheffield, as his allegiance with the renowned sporting psychiatrist Steve Peters continues to bear fruit. By his own admission, O’Sullivan was ready to walk away from snooker a decade ago before uniting with Peters. Since then, he has broken nearly every record there is to break on the baize, including the most career centuries, most ranking titles and a further four world crowns in little more than 10 years. “I thought I was done at 35,” O’Sullivan admitted. “When I went to see Steve in 2011, I was ready to quit. By 33, the likes of Hendry and [Steve] Davis were on the way down, I’d accepted that was the trend. But me, Willo [Mark Williams] and [John] Higgins have kept on going and we’re still playing. I lacked that skill which he has developed in me and I wouldn’t have carried on otherwise.” “He asked me to help him be happy playing his sport,” Peters told Radio 4’s Today programme. “He’s learned to understand himself and got insights into the way he functions. He’s a very emotional man and they can get the better of him but he’s learned to recognise the trigger points, which is why he’s presenting as a different person at the snooker table. He’s very empathic but serious in what he does.” How fitting too that the latest success for snooker’s serial winner was followed every step of the way by a camera crew who will produce an upcoming Netflix documentary about O’Sullivan’s life and career. They have followed him for the last six months but in final scenes not too dissimilar to The Last Dance, which captured Chicago Bulls’ 1998 NBA play-off triumph, there will be a happy ending to this show, too. “I suppose it is a bit of a dream ending,” he said. “They’ve been following me around for six or seven months and I couldn’t have envisaged this, they’ve had a result really. There is a shelf life to every player but I don’t want to be sitting around doing nothing, I just want to prolong my career as long as I can. “If I can get another two world titles out, that would be great … but I just like playing. I enjoy work away from snooker and I’m not all-in with snooker now. I became all-in this week, I was emotionally involved. For most of the year it’s like a holiday; win or lose, it didn’t matter, but this was a different beast and I found it difficult to go into the pit again. “They say they’ve never had so much access to a sportsman before. They’ve been everywhere. There’s probably enough content to do a five-hour show.” But while the Netflix documentary about snooker’s grand master of the baize will culminate with his latest triumph, you get the sneaking suspicion that O’Sullivan’s own story is still some way from completion. For his entire career he has shrugged off the importance of breaking records, but his emotions on Monday evening suggests he knows all too well what this latest victory represents.",Sport/Sport,"‘I could play to my mid-50s,’ says Ronnie O’Sullivan after seventh world title",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/03/i-could-play-to-my-mid-50s-says-ronnie-osullivan-after-seventh-world-snooker-title
5/4/2022,"For Liverpool, a 10th European Cup final appearance beckons and a shot at winning the thing for the seventh time. It was a night when their class told, specifically the control and composure that has seen them sweep all before them since the turn of the year, raising the prospect of an unprecedented quadruple. Never in doubt? Not exactly. The first half had been an ordeal for Jürgen Klopp and his players, their first-leg advantage wiped out as Villarreal ran riot. They scored through Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin and the crazy thing was that the team seventh in La Liga, with little experience of these kinds of nights, could have had more. How Liverpool reasserted themselves after the interval, the catalyst being Klopp’s introduction of Luis Díaz on the left. The January signing was virtually unplayable, tormenting anybody in his vicinity with his speed, balance and directness. It was as if a switch had been flicked and, sadly, the lights went out for Geronimo Rulli, the erratic Villarreal goalkeeper. He was at fault to varying degrees for each of the goals with which Liverpool turned the tie around, the first being the one that he and his teammates felt the most. It had been coming. Liverpool, unrecognisable from the first half, playing higher, more cohesively, finding the spaces and their passing patterns. But surely not when Fabinho took a pass up the inside right from Mohamed Salah and unloaded from a tight angle? Rulli had the position but, in real time, the shot seemed to go through him and did go between his legs. Liverpool were up and running. They would not look back. Díaz got the goal that his performance merited, timing his run through Villarreal’s last line to rise and power a header from Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cross past Rulli, the goalkeeper feeling the ball go through his legs. And Villarreal disintegrated thereafter, Liverpool ramming home their superiority with relish. Sadio Mané scored the third after Naby Keïta had wafted a lovely ball through for him but it was another personal disaster for Rulli. When he bolted a long way from his line, it was an all or nothing move. He got nothing, Mané reaching the ball first, walking it around him and then beating the covering Juan Foyth before rolling into the empty net. The hard truth for Villarreal was that Liverpool could have embellished the scoreline. Díaz had shot narrowly past the far post just before his goal and, at 3-2, the substitute Curtis Jones was denied by Rulli. Villarreal lost their heads. Pau Torres was booked for a naughty tackle on Mané while Etienne Capoue saw red late on for a second poor challenge. Klopp has endured some crushing lows against Spanish teams during his tenure, most notably the losses to Unai Emery’s Sevilla in the 2016 Europa League final and Real Madrid in the 2018 Champions League final. Not here. It was supposed to have been more straightforward – certainly on the evidence of the first leg last week when Liverpool had choked Villarreal into submission. But with this tight and atmospheric stadium bristling with belief, the home team had raced out of the blocks. A few pre-match statistics. Liverpool had trailed for a total of 69 minutes in matches since the turn of the year. They had kept 17 clean sheet in 28 games. They had not lost by two goals or more all season. Villarreal did not heed them . They had dreamed of scoring the first goal. When it came inside three minutes, they were in fantasy land. “Yes, we can,” had been the cry from the home crowd before kick-off. Now it reverberated with even more feeling. The early goal was all about the touch of Capoue. He tore around the back of Andy Robertson to reach a left wing cross from Pervis Estupiñán and the first-time cut-back was perfect, on a plate for Dia, who had burst away from Virgil van Dijk. Emery’s team snapped into challenges and they repeatedly found spaces in behind Alexander-Arnold and Robertson. Liverpool needed to shake their heads clear, to establish some sort of control but it was Villarreal who scented blood and they had the chances for 2-0 before 20 minutes were on the clock. Dani Parejo sent a low shot just wide while Gerard Moreno headed against Robertson from another Estupiñán cross when he might have done better. Liverpool could get little going before the interval and Villarreal were unlucky not to get a penalty on 37 minutes when Keïta gave away possession and Moreno played in Giovani Lo Celso. Alisson seemed to hesitate before he cleaned him out and, if the goalkeeper got a piece of the ball, it was not entirely by design. Villarreal did not cry. Instead, they scored again. Capoue crossed, after coming back inside Robertson with a Cruyff turn, and Coquelin leapt in front of Alexander-Arnold to power home. Klopp told his players that they had to move smarter in the second half, use the ball on the half-turn, mix it up. Villarreal had marked one-on-one before the break and Liverpool had been too static. Now they cut loose.Villarreal, meanwhile, appeared to have punched themselves out. They could not maintain the intensity. Alexander-Arnold watched a shot deflect off Coquelin, loop up and drop down on to the top of the crossbar while Díaz fluffed an attempted scissors kick when well-placed. Rather abruptly, the tide had turned. Klopp and Liverpool were on their way.",Sport/Football,Díaz turns tide at Villarreal to send Liverpool to Champions League final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/03/villarreal-liverpool-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report
