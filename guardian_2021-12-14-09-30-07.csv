12/14/2021,"Britain’s online safety bill needs a sweeping overhaul to prevent children from accessing pornography, vulnerable people from being encouraged to commit self-harm and negligent tech chiefs from failing to protect users, according to a committee of MPs and peers. A wide-ranging series of proposals to amend the pioneering legislation also includes creating a new criminal offence for cyberflashing, punishing tech platforms for hosting fraudulent adverts, and exempting news organisations from content takedowns.  The recommendations by the joint committee on the draft online safety bill will tackle an industry that has become the “land of the lawless”, according to committee’s Conservative chair, Damian Collins MP. “A lack of regulation online has left too many people vulnerable to abuse, fraud, violence and in some cases even loss of life,” he said. Other changes urged by the report include: Creating a digital ombudsman to deal with complaints by individuals against platforms Introducing codes of conduct that tackle “rabbit hole” algorithms Requiring tech companies to implement mechanisms to deal with harmful anonymous accounts Social media companies having to reveal how many underage users are on their platforms. The online safety bill covers websites and apps that offer user-generated content, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok and YouTube, as well as search engines such as Google. It imposes a duty of care on these companies to protect users from harmful content, or face substantial fines levied by Ofcom, the communications regulator charged with overseeing the legislation once it becomes law. However, the draft legislation has been criticised by campaigners for leaving too many loopholes on a range of issues from preventing children from accessing pornography to tackling anonymous abuse. The committee’s recommendations include introducing new criminal offences for: cyberflashing; encouragement of serious self-harm; deliberately sending flashing images to people with epilepsy with the intention of inducing a fit; and sending false communications – such as deep-fake videos – which intentionally cause “non-trivial” emotional, psychological or physical harm. The committee warns that cyber-flashing has become a serious and prevalent problem online, with more than three-quarters of girls aged 12-18 and four out of 10 of all women reporting having been sent unsolicited images of penises. “Regardless of the intention(s) behind it, cyberflashing can violate, humiliate and frighten victims, and limit women’s participation in online spaces,” said the report. Although the criminal charge for encouraging serious self-harm would apply to individuals, the report also makes clear that platforms must be held to account legally as well and urges the government to make it easier for users and their families to sue platforms for failing to adhere to the act. The father of Molly Russell, a 14-year-old schoolgirl who killed herself after viewing graphic images of self-harm and suicide online, welcomed the report. “I am glad the era of a self-regulated internet is coming to an end. The platforms must now stop monetising misery and instead be compelled to prioritise safety,” said Ian Russell. The report also steps up the threat of criminal sanctions for tech executives, who have been warned by Boris Johnson and the culture secretary overseeing the legislation, Nadine Dorries, that they will be in the firing line under an amended bill. The report calls for tech companies to appoint a boardroom-level executive who will be designated the firm’s “safety controller” and will be liable for a new criminal offence: failing to deal with “repeated and systemic failings that result in a significant risk of serious harm to users”. Tech firms have warned that such a move will stymie investment in the UK and could be copied by non-democratic regimes. The report proposed a series of measures to protect children, including imposing a legal duty on pornography sites to prevent children from accessing them, which is likely to require age-assurance procedures called for by children’s safety campaigners. The committee also calls for social media and video sharing platforms, which bar under-13-year-olds from their apps, to reveal how many underage users they have. The inclusion of advertising in the report will be seen as another victory for campaigners, who have warned of the devastation caused by fraudulent ads online. Under the committee’s recommendation, Ofcom would be charged with acting against platforms that consistently allow the publication of harmful adverts. The government is expected to respond to the report early next year, followed by the publication of a revised bill, a second reading in parliament by April and then the bill becoming law in late 2022 or early 2023. The committee’s report is expected to be influential, with Dorries having pledged in November to look at the recommendations “very seriously”. In a statement, Dorries said: “Our groundbreaking bill will require tech firms and social media companies to take long-overdue responsibility to protect their users – especially children – from a full range of illegal and harmful content. Crucially, the new comprehensive legislation will hold big tech to account if they fail to act.”",News/Technology,MPs call for online safety bill overhaul to protect children and penalise tech firms,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/14/mps-call-for-online-safety-bill-overhaul-to-protect-children-and-penalise-tech-firms
12/14/2021,"It may bear the unassuming title of a “consultation paper”. But critics believe that the document released by Dominic Raab’s department on Tuesday is the culmination of a steady 12-year campaign by the justice secretary to rip up the Human Rights Act. Footage of Raab from 2009 shows the then backbench MP looking into the camera and saying: “I don’t support the Human Rights Act and I don’t believe in economic and social rights.”  A few months after the footage was recorded, he released a book entitled The Assault on Liberty: What Went Wrong With Rights in which he argued that the law had opened the door to a slew of new court claims. “The spread of rights has become contagious and, since the Human Rights Act, opened the door to vast new categories of claims, which can be judicially enforced against the government through the courts,” he wrote. The book also articulated a theme that has become a rallying cry for many in the post-Brexit Conservative party: that the UK can never truly leave the EU while the nation’s laws are trumped by European courts. “The very enactment of the Human Rights Act has served as a trigger for the formulation of claims by lawyers and judicial reasoning by courts, using human rights arguments that would never have been dared before,” he said. Conservative critics of Boris Johnson say Raab was demoted from foreign secretary in September’s reshuffle in part because his predecessor Robert Buckland would not take on the legal establishment with the gusto required. One ally of Buckland said: “They wanted a wrecking ball, and Raab fits the bill.” Johnson remains keen to further curb the power of the judiciary over parliament. He is still said to be furious after his 2019 decision to delay the opening of parliament, which many saw as an attempt to prevent MPs scrutinising the government’s Brexit plans, was reversed by the supreme court as a result of a successful judicial review. But Tuesday’s plans have attracted criticisms from unusual sources, who may yet force some changes. MI5, MI6 and GHCQ have told ministers that changes to the Human Rights Act could make it harder for them to defend cases in courts. In evidence to the independent Human Rights Act review committee, which could recommend changes, the security services said it would be unhelpful if the government went too far. They warned that unless the government was careful, terrorist suspects could take their cases directly to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg, where such evidence could not be submitted in secret. Buckland and other senior Conservatives, including several government officials, are expected to resist changes and could well gain support in the House of Lords. Labour have pledged to oppose any move to radically change the act. Steve Reed MP, the shadow justice secretary, said Raab was tinkering with human rights laws as a distraction from the “avalanche of corruption” that had overwhelmed the government. He said: “Our criminal justice system is in crisis, with record backlogs in the crown courts, huge delays in prosecuting criminals, and shamefully low conviction rates for rape and sexual offences. Ministers should be focusing on sorting out the failures in our courts, prisons and probation services that are stoking, rather than stopping, crime.”",News/Politics,Dominic Raab’s paper seen as fulfilment of quest to destroy Human Rights Act,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/14/dominic-raabs-paper-seen-as-fulfilment-of-quest-to-destroy-human-rights-act
12/14/2021,"Dominic Raab is to outline a sweeping overhaul of human rights law that he claims will counter “wokery and political correctness” and expedite the deportation of foreign criminals. The highly controversial reforms, to be announced on Tuesday – which will create a new bill of rights – will introduce a permission stage to “deter spurious human rights claims” and change the balance between freedom of expression and privacy.  But lawyers described the proposed changes to the Human Rights Act as dangerous and fuelled by political rhetoric rather than necessity. They pointed out that the government has signalled its intentions before the independent review of the Human Rights Act, which is due to be published later on Tuesday. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said the intended reforms would allow judges to override rulings from the European court of human rights, rather than following them “blindly”. It claimed that as many as seven out of 10 successful human rights challenges were brought by foreign national offenders who cited a right to family life in the first instance when appealing against deportation orders – a practice it wants to end. A senior MoJ source said the government felt strongly that free speech and democratic debate had been whittled away “whether by wokery or political correctness”. After the Mail on Sunday’s failed appeal over its publication of a letter written by Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, to her estranged father, the source said common-law privacy laws had “come in by the back door” and that freedom of speech needed to be given “extra weight”. But Stephanie Boyce, president of the Law Society, said any changes to the Human Rights Act should be led by evidence and not driven by political rhetoric. She said: “British judges deliver British justice based on British laws, looking closely at how judgments fit into the national context, and disapplying them if there is good reason to do so. UK courts do not, as government suggests, ‘blindly’ follow case law from the European court of human rights. “Equally, foreign criminals already can be deported in the public interest even where there are arguments against this from the right to family life. Every case is different, making it necessary to weigh each on its own particulars. Talk of restricting rights is dangerous and does not reflect the nuanced job the courts have to do.” The MoJ has highlighted the fight over prisoners’ voting rights, and the requirement for police to issue “threat to life” notices – known as Osman warnings – to gang members as examples of unwelcome interference from Strasbourg. Without explaining how, the MoJ said its plans would also reduce pull factors to the UK being exploited by people-smugglers facilitating dangerous small boat crossings. But it confirmed that the UK would remain a party to the European convention on human rights. Martha Spurrier, director at Liberty, highlighted instances of the Human Rights Act helping people achieve justice, including LGBT military veterans getting their medals back after they were stripped of them because of their sexuality, and unmarried women receiving their widow’s pension after the death of their partners. She described the plans as “a blatant, unashamed power grab,” adding: “Today’s announcement is being cast as strengthening our rights when in fact, if this plan goes through, they will be fatally weakened. This government is systematically shutting down all avenues of accountability through a succession of rushed and oppressive bills. We must ensure the government changes course as a matter of urgency, before we very quickly find ourselves wondering where our fundamental human rights have gone.” Sacha Deshmukh, the chief executive of Amnesty International, said human rights are not “sweets” ministers can “pick and choose from” and the “aggressive” attempt to “roll-back” the laws needs to be stopped. He added: “If ministers move ahead with plans to water down the Human Rights Act and override judgments with which they disagree, they risk aligning themselves with authoritarian regimes around the world.” Prof Philippe Sands QC, who sat on the 2013 commission on a bill of rights, said: “The concern is that this will mark a further step in the government’s eager embrace of lawlessness, undermining the rights of all individuals, the effective role of British judges and the European court, and the devolution settlement into which the Human Rights Act is embedded.” Adam Wagner, a leading human rights barrister with Doughty Street chambers, said: “If this is to be a true bill of rights, instead of a party political rights wishlist, as this appears to be, the government should obtain cross-party support.”",News/Law,Raab to claim overhaul of human rights law will counter ‘political correctness’,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/dec/14/raab-to-claim-overhaul-human-rights-law-counter-political-correctness
12/14/2021,"Coronavirus passports could lead to increased uptake of vaccines, especially among young people, a study suggests. Research by the University of Oxford found Covid-19 certification led to increased jab uptake 20 days before and 40 days after introduction in countries with lower-than-average vaccination coverage. Increase in vaccine uptake was most pronounced in people under 30. The modelling analysis was published in The Lancet Public Health.  Coronavirus passports require people to have proof of either complete vaccination, a negative test or a Covid-19 recovery certificate to access public venues and events, such as restaurants or concerts. As well as helping to prevent the spread of coronavirus in public venues, it has been suggested they may encourage more unvaccinated people to get vaccinated, particularly those who perceive their own risk of hospitalisation or death from Covid-19 as low. Prof Melinda Mills, the director of the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford and the study’s lead author, said: “As mass vaccination programmes continue to play a central role in protecting public health in this pandemic, increasing vaccine uptake is crucial both to protect the individuals immunised and break chains of infection in the community. “Our study is an important first empirical assessment of whether Covid-19 certification can form part of this strategy. Overall, we observed a significant uptick in anticipation of restrictions coming into place about 20 days before introduction, which lasted up to 40 days after, but the context of existing vaccination uptake, vaccine hesitancy, levels of trust in authorities, and pandemic trajectory was crucial to the impact.” Many countries have either introduced or are considering introduction of Covid-19 certification, but whether this public health intervention increases vaccine uptake is unclear. From Wednesday, NHS Covid passes showing full vaccination or a recent negative test will be required in England for entry to indoor venues containing more than 500 people, unseated outdoor venues with more than 4,000 people, and any venue with more than 10,000 people, subject to a vote on Tuesday. Some survey-based evidence has suggested that people reported they would be less likely to get vaccinated if Covid passports were introduced, while some countries have reported increases in uptake after the introduction of Covid-19 certification. In the study, researchers linked data on Covid certification introduced between April and September this year to vaccination uptake in six countries where certification was legally required – Denmark, Israel, Italy, France, Germany and Switzerland. The study used modelling to estimate what vaccine uptake would have been without Covid-19 certification in all six countries, based on vaccination uptake trends from 19 otherwise similar control countries without certification. In countries where vaccine coverage was previously low, introduction of vaccine passports was associated with a significant increase in the number of additional vaccine doses per million people – 127,823 in France, 243,151 in Israel, 64,952 in Switzerland and 66,382 in Italy, according to the study. Researchers found that in Denmark and Germany, where there were higher average vaccination rates, there was no significant increase in vaccination after the introduction of certification. The study’s co-author Dr Tobias Ruttenauer, from the University of Oxford, said: “We know that certain groups have lower vaccine uptake than others and it may be that Covid-19 certification is a useful way to encourage vaccine-complacent groups, such as young people and men, to get vaccinated. “However, Covid-19 certification alone is not a silver bullet for improving vaccine uptake and must be used alongside other policies. Vaccine hesitancy due to lack of trust in authorities, which is common among some minority-ethnic and lower socioeconomic groups, may be addressed more successfully through other interventions, such as targeted vaccine drives and community dialogue to generate more understanding about Covid-19 vaccines.” The authors said there were limitations to their study. There was no data available to examine vaccine uptake by sociodemographic, gender and ethnic groups. They also emphasised that Covid-19 certification policies across the six countries were different for various reasons, and acknowledged that the causes of vaccine hesitancy are diverse across different countries, which may limit the generalisability of their findings. The authors also raised several issues linked with Covid passports that policymakers should consider, including the risk of exacerbating inequalities among communities with lower uptake, generating inequality in access to public spaces where Covid-19 vaccine rollout is staggered by age, entrenching digital divides if passports are electronic, and data privacy concerns.",News/World news,"Covid passports could increase vaccine uptake, study suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/covid-passports-could-increase-vaccine-uptake-study-suggests
12/14/2021,"It may not be rocket science, but researchers have found aerospace engineers and brain surgeons are not necessarily brighter than the general population. Researchers examined data from an international cohort of 329 aerospace engineers and 72 neurosurgeons who completed 12 tasks online using the Great British Intelligence Test (GBIT) from the Cognitron platform, as well as answering questions around their age, sex and levels of experience in their speciality.  The tasks examined various aspects of cognition, including planning and reasoning, working memory, attention, and emotion processing abilities. The researchers then compared the results against those previously gathered from more than 18,000 members of the British public. The findings, which were published in the festive edition of the BMJ, reveal that only neurosurgeons showed a significant difference, with quicker problem-solving speed but slower memory recall compared with the general population. “The difference in problem-solving speed exhibited by neurosurgeons might arise from the fast-paced nature of neurosurgery, which attracts those with a pre-existing flair for rapid processing, or it could be, albeit less likely, a product of training for rapid decision-making in time-critical situations,” the researchers noted. The researchers said the study was, in part, carried out to lay to rest the question of whether one of the professions had the intellectual upper hand – a tension made famous by the Mitchell and Webb sketch in which a swaggering neurosurgeon is slapped down by an aerospace expert who says: “Brain surgery … it’s not exactly rocket science is it?” However, the team found few differences between the cognitive abilities of aerospace engineers and neuroscientists, although the results suggest the former had higher scores for attention and mental manipulation – such as rotating objects in one’s head – while neurosurgeons showed higher scores in semantic problem solving – such as definitions of rare words. “Essentially what we think it shows is that everyone has a range of skills, some people are better at some things and other people are better at other things, and it is very difficult to be better in everything across the board,” said Aswin Chari, a neurosurgical trainee at Great Ormond Street hospital and an author of the study. Referencing the two professions in the study, Chari added: “It is not that they are better at everything, but they are better at certain things that make them good at what they do.” It may therefore be best to ditch rocket science and brain surgery idioms for phases like “it’s a walk in the park”, added the researchers. “It is also possible that other professions might deserve to be on that pedestal, and future work should aim to determine the most deserving group,” they said.",News/Science,"Brain surgeons and rocket scientists no brighter than the rest of us, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/dec/13/brain-surgeon-or-rocket-scientist-study-tries-to-find-out-who-is-smarter
