5/6/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co.’s decision to leave Chicago is the latest blow to a U.S. city that already has seen its once-mighty economy battered by Covid-19 and crime.

Chicago, the nation’s third-most populous city, has seen a rise in crime that prompted its richest resident, Citadel founder Ken Griffin, to say he’s likely to move his $38 billion hedge fund elsewhere. Chicago’s Magnificent Mile and State Street shopping districts, along with many restaurants in the downtown Loop, have yet to recover from the pandemic. Even the National Football League’s Bears franchise is considering an exit to the suburbs. “Boeing’s decision to leave Illinois is incredibly disappointing -- every level of government in our state has worked to make Chicago and Illinois the perfect home for Boeing’s headquarters for the past 20 years,” U.S. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois said in a statement Thursday. “We are working together to ensure Boeing leadership both understands how harmful this move will be and does everything possible to protect Illinois’s workers and jobs.” Chicago remains home for many big companies, including McDonald’s Corp., Aon Plc, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., Conagra Brands Inc. and R.R. Donnelley & Co. But the city has had other recent departures. United Airlines Holdings Inc. said in December that it will move as many as 1,300 workers from its Willis Tower headquarters to Arlington Heights, a suburb about 30 miles (48 kilometers) away that also is being considered by the Chicago Bears. Arlington is wealthier, with 2020 per-capita personal income of $100,823, or 169.4% of the national average, compared with Chicago’s Cook County at $69,935, or 117.5%, government data show. Since 2000, compounded annual growth for the Chicago metropolitan area was 2.9%, compared with 4.1% in the Washington, D.C., area. A recurring complaint about Chicago is crime, which is up 35% so far this year compared to the same period in 2021. Though murders and shooting incidents are down, all other major categories of crime are up, including a 67% jump in thefts. Boeing says the biggest chunk of its employees remain in Washington state -- more than 55,000 employees out of nearly 142,000. In 2018, the company estimated it had 729 employees in Illinois, where it spent $1 billion on suppliers and vendors, and donated $23.8 million to local charities that year. The company said Thursday it would “maintain a significant presence” in the city. Boeing moved its headquarters from Seattle to a 36-story building along the Chicago River in 2001, choosing the city over Denver and Dallas as the company sought to expand beyond planemaking and to be more centrally located in the U.S. Mayor Lori Lightfoot offered assurances that Chicago is a thriving economy that’s attracting new businesses with its diverse workforce and expansive infrastructure-network. “Chicago is a world-class city and in the last year, 173 corporations relocated or expanded here, and 67 corporations have made that same decision since the start of 2022,” Lightfoot said in a statement on Thursday. “We have a robust pipeline of major corporate relocations and expansions, and we expect more announcements in the coming months.” Lightfoot also announced that Bally’s Corp. will build a $1.7 billion casino and hotel complex that would generate 3,000 permanent jobs and hundreds of millions in tax revenue.

5/6/2022,"In 2014, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was dominating the front covers of renowned business magazines for being the youngest self-made billionaire in the world. In 2022, she’s making headlines again ––but for all the wrong reasons. A recent Hulu series, The Dropout, has led to more interest in Holmes, her relationship with former COO Sunny Balwani, and where she is today. Here's the background on Holmes' story, what she and Balwani are doing today, and what the future could hold. Holmes had a childhood dream of becoming a billionaire. At 19, she dropped out of Stanford to work on her ""revolutionary"" blood-testing startup called Theranos. With Theranos, Holmes promised to eliminate needles from the blood testing process, claiming that her ""proprietary"" machine called the ""Edison"" could deliver cheaper and faster results for over 240 diseases with a single pin-prick and a drop of blood. Holmes was a descendant of the family that founded America’s first yeast company and was also the daughter of a former Enron VP and congressional aide. Her pedigreed background helped link Theranos with some of the biggest names in America. She appointed luminaries like former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and ex-director of CDC William Foege to her board of directors and landed contracts with industry giants like Pfizer and Safeway. She even convinced high-profilers like Oracle founder Larry Ellison and pharmacy leader Walgreens to invest in her startup, raising over $700 million without ever disclosing how her technology worked. This secrecy reflected the company’s work culture and Elizabeth herself, who hired bodyguards to drive her around, installed bulletproof glass in her office windows, and forbade employees from discussing projects with workers in other departments. Holmes enjoyed the media spotlight, speaking at TED Talks and panels with Bill Clinton and Jack Ma. By 2014, Theranos had testing centers in 40 Walgreens stores and was valued at a whopping $9 billion. But while all this was happening, skeptics started questioning Holmes’ claims. In 2014, Theranos employee Tyler Schultz called out Holmes for ignoring failed quality control checks in the testing process. Despite receiving threats from Holmes, Tyler contacted the Public Health Laboratory in New York, alleging that Theranos was doctoring research and manipulating its proficiency testing. By 2015, the FDA was investigating Theranos, finding “major inaccuracies” in the tests it was performing on patients. For example, a Theranos STD test claimed it was accurate 95% of the time. But regulators found the results to be accurate only 65% to 80% of the time. Holmes’ misdeeds caught public attention when WSJ reporter John Carreyrou published a series of reports exposing her lies and flawed blood test results. Soon after, Walgreens sued Theranos for $140 million dollars for misleading them about the capabilities of the technology. In 2016, the SEC slapped Holmes and her ex-boyfriend and Theranos COO Sunny Balwani with 11 felony counts for fraud against investors and patients. Theranos completely shut down by 2019. Holmes’ trial began in September 2021 and prosecutors and witnesses exposed her as a fraud. Here are some of the most shocking revelations of the trial: To get investor funding, Holmes claimed that the world’s 10 largest pharmaceutical companies had validated Theranos’ results. They had not. Holmes allegedly forged Pfizer’s logo and letterhead on the lab results she showed to investors to make them think she had contracts with Pfizer. Theranos hid its inaccuracies by substituting Edison’s reports with results from regular blood draws done on traditional machines; in fact, most tests were run on regular machines. Whistleblowers testified to Holmes firing engineers who told her the Edison didn’t work. Ex-Theranos patients testified against the health tech company for providing faulty test results. One such patient was Brittany Gould, who was told that she was having a miscarriage when, in fact, she had a healthy pregnancy. Because of the false positive, she changed the medication she was taking, which could have harmed the fetus. Elizabeth Holmes’ central defense was that her manipulations were in the spirit of progress and that she was simply trying to make the company succeed. “Coming up short is not a crime,” she said. She also blamed her ex-partner Sunny Balwani for most of the wrongdoings, claiming that he controlled and abused her throughout their relationship, which hindered her decision-making. Holmes’ lawyer presented a handwritten note that outlined her daily schedule and affirmations which, according to Holmes, Balwani dictated along with how she should act and speak. “I speak rarely. When I do—CRISP and CONCISE. I call bullshit immediately. My hands are always in my pockets or gesturing,” the last few lines of the note read. Balwani and his lawyers have denied the abuse claims, calling them “salacious and inflammatory” and remain firm that Holmes was the final decision-maker of the company, not Balwani. But recently, a series of text exchanges between Balwani and Holmes came forward, suggesting Balwani had more power than he admits. “I am responsible for everything at Theranos,” Balwani wrote in a text to Holmes, as reported by NBC. After a lengthy trial and almost 30 witnesses, the court found Holmes guilty of four counts of criminal fraud against investors with 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each of her convictions. The jury acquitted Holmes of charges of fraud against patients. Because the conviction was for a non-violent, white-collar crime, legal experts think it’s likely that Holmes will only spend three years behind bars, and that too in a premium prison with low security and plenty of facilities like pilates classes, tennis courts, and arts programs. The recent birth of her baby boy with husband Billy Evans could further reduce her sentence. White-collar defense lawyer Amanda Kramer told NPR that Holmes’ case is a deterrent for business owners who may intend to commit fraud. She said it would be ""utterly shocking"" if Holmes dodged imprisonment. Balwani is going through a separate trial for fraud along with the abuse allegations. According to Kramer, Balwani’s case affects Holmes’ sentence, which is why the court has set her sentencing date in September 2022. Once touted “the next Steve Jobs” with a net worth of $4.5 billion, Elizabeth Holmes has fallen from grace (and money) and is now worth $0, according to Forbes. Currently out on a $500,000 bail bond, Holmes is living it up in her $135 million Green Gables estate in Silicon Valley with her husband and son. After working at companies like Microsoft and Lotus, Sunny made his riches after founding his e-commerce startup CommerceBid at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 90s. After the industry burst, he pursued further studies and, at 37, went to China as part of a summer program where he met 18-year-old Elizabeth. After 3 years in 2005, the two started dating and Sunny gave Holmes a $13 million personal loan to help fund Theranos. In 2009, Sunny became the president and COO, reigning the Theranos C-suite with Holmes until the pair split in 2016 and he quit the company. As a key decision-maker in Theranos, Sunny has been charged with the same counts as Holmes and is going through a separate trial that began in March 2022. It has been reported that he just sold the luxury home he and Holmes co-owned (later bought out by Balwani) for almost $16 million as he plows money for his ongoing litigation.

5/6/2022,"If you’re thinking about buying the dip in stocks, you might want to think again. According to Paul Tudor Jones, the billionaire founder of Tudor Investment Corporation, it’s still not the time to go on a shopping spree. “You can’t think of a worse environment than where we are right now for financial assets,” he told CNBC on Tuesday, adding that “clearly you don’t want to own bonds and stocks.” Instead of aiming for high returns, the hedge fund manager says protecting your money should be the priority. But if you still want to invest, he suggests one approach that might be worth considering. “If there was a strategy that I would want to employ right now, if someone put a gun to my head, I’d say simple trend-following strategies.” Trend-following simply involves buying an asset when its price trends up and selling it when its price trends down. The goal is to capture the continuation in the price movement. Let’s take a look at three ways you might want to apply the strategy in today’s market.

Fueled by rising commodity prices, energy was the S&P 500’s best-performing sector in 2021, returning a total of 53% vs the index’s 27% return. And that momentum has carried into 2022. Year to date, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) is up 37%, while the S&P 500 has tumbled roughly 13%. XLE aims to track the performance of the S&P 500’s energy sector. If the positive momentum in energy prices continues, the ETF is a good bet to keep delivering market-topping returns. There are also more direct ways to follow energy commodities. For instance, the United States Oil Fund (USO) offers exposure to oil futures and is up 40% in 2022. The United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG) tracks movements in natural gas prices, and has more than doubled year to date. Slowing economic growth, paired with spiking inflation, generally doesn’t bode well for financial assets like stocks and bonds. But it could be an opportune time to check out agriculture. No matter what the economy is doing, people need to eat. For a convenient way to get broad exposure to the agriculture sector, check out the Invesco DB Agriculture Fund (DBA). It tracks an index made up of futures contracts on some of the most widely traded agriculture commodities — including corn, soybeans and sugar. The fund is up 11% in 2022. You can also use ETFs to tap into individual agricultural commodities. The Teucrium Wheat Fund (WEAT) and the Teucrium Corn Fund (CORN) have gained 44% and 35%, respectively, in 2021. The Fed is raising interest rates to tame inflation. Higher rates increase the cost of borrowing, which could hurt consumers and businesses. At the same time, higher interest rates imply a higher risk-free rate of return, making stocks less attractive. However, if you own investments that are well-positioned for a rising interest rate environment, the Fed’s hawkishness could be a positive for your portfolio. It might make sense to look into the ProShares Equities for Rising Rates ETF (EQRR). The fund tracks the performance of the Nasdaq U.S. Large Cap Equities for Rising Rates Index. As the name suggests, this ETF aims to outperform traditional large-cap indexes (like the S&P 500) in periods of increasing U.S. Treasury interest rates. While EQRR is up just slightly year to date, it has soundly thumped the S&P 500’s double-digit percentage drop over the same time frame.

5/6/2022,"It's been pretty easy to make money on stocks over the past decade. One can't-miss strategy: You just buy the big names in tech. Repeat over and over again. From February 2009 to last November, investors marveled as the value of the tech-heavy Nasdaq doubled, and doubled, and doubled again—and kept going—to soar from 1,400 to 16,200. That to-the-moon trajectory made some sense—it coincided with a period of rock-bottom interest rates and easy-money Federal Reserve policy. The bulls saw this as a golden era of lower-for-longer interest rates, which gave rise to, among other things, the TINA (there is no alternative) stock-picking strategy, and the rise of YOLO (remember that?) retail traders. All that must seem like a distant memory. The Nasdaq fell 5% yesterday, the worst performer of the major exchanges, and its worst one-day performance since last June. It's now down 22.2% this year, firmly in a bear market. Thursday's wipeout—in total, global stocks took a $1.3 trillion hit yesterday, Bloomberg calculates—was felt across the board, with big-cap tech getting hit particularly hard. According to Deutsche Bank, the FANG+ Index tumbled 6.4% on Thursday. This morning, ahead of a big jobs reports, Nasdaq futures were down a quarter of a percent at 4 a.m. ET. In better days, FAANG of course was a handy acronym for the high-flyers of tech: Facebook (now Meta Platforms), Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google's Alphabet. Add in Microsoft, and you had the sextet of tech darlings that lifted retirement portfolios the world over. Well, some big names on Wall Street think it's time to dump that acronym—or at least rethink it—to find some value amid all the carnage. View this interactive chart on Fortune.com In an investor note, Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank investment strategists Lauren J. Sanfilippo and Joseph P. Quinlan see us in a different investing epoch of war and high inflation and energy transformation—one that needs a new FAANG. ""In a matter of months,"" they wrote, ""we have gone from a pandemic to Putin; infections to inflation; Big Data to Big Oil; zoom to zinc; masks to mascara; E-commerce to electric vehicles; jabs to javelins; swabs to sanctions; Webex to weddings; boosters to bombs; Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to liquefied natural gas (LNG); Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); work-from-home to work-from-office; the cloud to cobalt; and lite assets to hard assets."" They see a new murderer's row of roll-off-your-tongue heavyweights. Out are Facebook, Apple, blah, blah, blah—known as FAANG 1.0. In are the new growth areas of Fuels, Aerospace & defense, Agriculture, Nuclear and renewables, and Gold and metals/minerals. Call it FAANG 2.0. ""This cohort is emblematic of a world undergoing profound change. A sampling of this change: energy security is now the top priority of most governments—just ask Poland and Bulgaria, cut off from Russian gas last week. Global defense spending topped $2 trillion for the first time in 2021 and is headed higher. World food prices are at record highs. Nuclear is poised for a comeback; Electric Vehicle demand continues to soar. Gold is now the preferred asset of central banks thanks to geopolitics, while resource/food nationalism is proliferating around the world, adding even more upside pressure to metal/mineral and food prices,"" they explained. Sanfilippo and Quinlan first floated this FAANG 2.0 in February, and the diverging performance of the the two groups has only grown since then. In the investor note, the duo don't tip individual stocks, but you don't have to dig to deep to find them. For example, Archer-Daniels-Midland food giant is up nearly 32% year to date, defense contractor Lockheed Martin is up 25% in the same period, and miner Rio Tinto (gold and uranium) is up 3% YTD.

5/6/2022,"The Fed may no longer be a friend of investors, pros say, and that could be a major headwind to stocks in the near-term. ""What’s dangerous about yesterday’s huge market slump is that there must be an element of doubting the ability of there to be an effective 'Fed Put' in this cycle following a 30-40 year period where the central bank has almost always been able to come to the market's rescue,"" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1,120 points on Thursday, or 3.3%. The S&P 500 tanked 3.7%. As for the Nasdaq Composite, it tanked 5.2% for its worst day since 2020. Amazon shares hit a fresh 52-week low. ""As bad as today was, the VIX Index is not showing sufficient 'fear' to indicate a near term bottom,"" said the team at DataTrek. The VIX settled at 32.85 on Thursday. Thursday's brutal session represented a swift sentiment reversal from Wednesday, when traders breathed a sigh of relief after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank was not considering a 75 basis-point increase in interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 932.27 points and the S&P 500 gained 2.99% on Wednesday, the largest gains for the two indices since 2000. Even the beaten-up Nasdaq Composite popped 3.19%. As Reid suggested, it now appears that traders have formed a more lasting near-term view that the Fed is far from dovish, has let inflation get out of control, and is still poised to dramatically slow down the economy through a series of 50 basis point rate increases. ""I can't help but think that a great deal of the reaction yesterday was the appreciation that whilst the Fed can make soothing pronouncements, they are starting from an extraordinary difficult starting point and with limited flexibility to respond to market or economy concerns whilst they fight inflation,"" Reid added. ""The only conclusion you can draw is that the market quickly realized that the Fed really aren't going to be able to control this cycle very easily.""

5/6/2022,"Michael Saylor is perhaps one of the most fervent supporters of Bitcoin on the planet—and that’s saying something, given the almost cultlike community behind the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Saylor, an MIT graduate and the cofounder and CEO of the business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, has become a hero to the Bitcoin faithful ever since his company began stockpiling the cryptocurrency in August 2020. The CEO has gone so far as to call Bitcoin “freedom,” and “the most universally desirable property in space and time.” And at Bitcoin 2022 Miami—the largest Bitcoin event worldwide—Saylor was met by thousands of cheering fans as he instructed the crowd to never sell their crypto. Saylor’s Bitcoin appetite has grown so much that the CEO is now borrowing millions from banks to add more of the cryptocurrency to MicroStrategy’s balance sheet. The collateral? That’s right, more Bitcoin. MicroStrategy added another $215 million worth of Bitcoin at an average purchase price of $44,645 per coin in the first quarter, SEC filings show, bringing its total holdings to 129,218 Bitcoins acquired for $3.97 billion, or $30,700 per coin. At Bitcoin’s $39,800 price as of 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday, the company’s holdings were worth over $5.1 billion. The company’s market cap, on the other hand, is roughly $4 billion. MicroStrategy has said it has no plans to sell its Bitcoin, and thus far, its buy-and-hold strategy has been profitable. But with Bitcoin’s price down roughly 35% in the past six months, that may be changing. As a result of its status as a quasi-Bitcoin ETF, and a pile of over $2.3 billion in long-term debt, MicroStrategy’s stock is down over 20% in the past month and nearly 65% from its February 2021 all-time high of over $1,000 per share. And if Bitcoin’s value continues to fall, Saylor and company could face one hell of a margin call. MicroStrategy’s CFO Phong Le explained in the company’s first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday that if Bitcoin’s price falls below $21,000, or around 50% from current levels, it will be forced to pony up more cryptocurrency to back its $205 million Bitcoin-collateralized loan with Silvergate Bank that was used to buy Bitcoin in the first place. “We took out the loan at a 25% LTV; the margin call occurs at 50% LTV,” Le said. “So essentially, Bitcoin needs to cut in half, or around $21,000, before we’d have a margin call.” The CFO noted that MicroStrategy still holds “quite a bit” of uncollateralized Bitcoin that it could use to answer any potential margin call, however. “As you can see, we mentioned previously we have quite a bit of uncollateralized Bitcoin,” Le said. “So we have more that we could contribute in the case that we have a lot of downward volatility. But again, we're talking about $21,000 before we get to a point where there needs to be more margin or more collateral contributors. So I think we're in a pretty comfortable place where we are right now.” Still, taking out a loan collateralized by Bitcoin to buy more Bitcoin is a risky game. If the world’s leading cryptocurrency falls and a margin call goes through, MicroStrategy would be put in a tough spot. MicroStrategy did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.
