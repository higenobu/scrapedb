3/21/2022,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge ruled that a former county clerk from Kentucky knowingly violated the rights of same-sex couples by denying them marriage licenses in 2015, clearing the way for a jury trial seeking damages against her. The ruling from U.S. District Judge David Bunning on Friday also denied a request for immunity from former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis. Davis thrust herself into the center of the U.S. culture wars on the issue of LGBTQ rights by denying the licenses in 2015, citing her religious beliefs. She briefly went to jail for contempt of court over her refusal and a deputy clerk in the eastern Kentucky county issued the licenses. The two couples in the lawsuit had sought to marry in the immediate aftermath of the landmark 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges. They sued Davis in 2015, alleging she had violated their constitutional rights. In the Obergefell case, the highest court in the United States found that, under the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, states must grant same-sex marriages and recognize those of other states. But Davis repeatedly refused to issue marriage licenses, despite a letter from the governor instructing all county clerks to issue the licenses and a legal opinion from the Rowan County attorney, which she had sought, advising that she had a legal requirement to do so. ""It is readily apparent that Obergefell recognizes Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment right to marry. It is also readily apparent that Davis made a conscious decision to violate Plaintiffs' right,"" the judge ruled in a summary judgment. With the essential facts in the case now settled, the two couples, David Ermold and David Moore in one case and James Yates and Will Smith in another, can proceed to jury trial to seek damages against Davis as an individual. Davis had previously been granted sovereign immunity in her official capacity. Liberty Counsel, a Christian organization representing Davis, said it would continue to argue she is not liable for damages because she is entitled to a religious accommodation granted by the state legislature and former Governor Matt Bevin. The group's statement also noted that conservative justices on the U.S. Supreme Court could seek to revisit and overturn the Obergefell decision. ""This case raises serious First Amendment free exercise of religion claims and has a high potential of reaching the Supreme Court,"" Liberty Counsel founder and Chairman Mat Staver said in the statement.

3/21/2022,"(Adds more on cases being heard this week, recent Thomas speech) WASHINGTON, March 20 (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was admitted to a hospital in Washington on Friday after experiencing flu-like symptoms and was diagnosed with an infection, the high court said on Sunday. Thomas, 73, was being treated with intravenous antibiotics, his symptoms were abating, and he expected to be released from the Sibley Memorial Hospital in a day or two, the court said in a statement. The Supreme Court, which is set to be in session on Monday, said that Thomas will participate in the consideration of cases through briefs, transcripts, and audio of the oral arguments. The court is set to hear four cases this week. A court representative said earlier that all nine justices were fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and had received booster doses. A conservative and one of two Black men to have served on the Supreme Court, Thomas is the longest-serving of the current justices. The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority, including three justices appointed by President Joe Biden's Republican predecessor Donald Trump. Thomas was nominated by President George H.W. Bush in 1991 to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the retirement of liberal justice Thurgood Marshall, the first Black justice on the court. Separately on Monday, hearings will begin for federal appellate judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, Biden's nominee, to become the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court. Biden has tapped her to replace Stephen Breyer, 83, who is retiring and is the oldest justice on the current court. Thomas spoke on March 11 in Utah and raised concerns about calls to add additional members to the court, and discussed how the COVID-19 pandemic prompted the court to conduct arguments remotely. ""I didn’t like the free-for-all in oral arguments where we interacted and interrupted each other. It’s more productive now. The arguments are contributing to the process of deciding the case as opposed to what was happening, which was almost like a catfight,"" Thomas said, according to https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2022/03/12/justice-clarence-thomas the Salt Lake Tribune.

3/21/2022,"Ratings agency S&P Global has downgraded a slew of companies since the start of the war in Ukraine. This week, the agency cut Russia's sovereign rating deep into junk as sanctions have slammed its economy. The agency said there are already 30 corporates that have tumbled into junk territory as a direct result of the war. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has come with a heavy price for the government. Western sanctions have isolated it from the international financial system and choked off demand for many of its key exports. Sanctions have cut off Russia's access to much of its foreign reserves, threatening to plunge the country into default as it could struggle to meet its foreign debt payments. The ruble has plummeted to record lows and the country's stock market has been paralyzed for weeks. S&P Global this week cut Russia's credit rating to ""CC"", which it defines as ""default imminent with little prospect for recovery."" Four years ago, almost to the day, the agency awarded Russia an investment-grade ""BBB-"" rating. It's not just the government that will struggle to raise capital on the global market. Sanctions have thrown the future of many of its biggest companies into doubt. S&P Global said this week it had made 121 changes to the ratings of companies that cited the Russia-Ukraine war, rising energy prices, or both as reasons. Of that total, 77 were Russian. ""In terms of creditworthiness, the Russian-Ukraine conflict has had the largest impact on banks, with 28% of total related rating actions,"" the agency said. And investors are taking no chances. S&P Global Ratings noted the risk premium on European emerging-market corporate debt is now almost double its five-year average, compared to a roughly in-line reading at the start of the year. Formerly lucrative firms, such as banks, energy producers and mining companies, have been reduced to junk status. Commodity traders are deliberately shunning Russian shipments of key raw materials and countries are scrambling to wean themselves off Russian energy supplies. The agency said there are already 30 ""fallen angels"" as a direct result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The term refers to an issuer whose credit rating has been cut from investment grade to speculative grade, also known as junk. Shares in some of the country's biggest corporates no longer trade in New York or London, where stock in the likes of Sberbank, oil and gas producers Gazprom and Rosneft, and metal producers Norilsk and Rusal, plunged to almost $0 a couple of weeks ago. And it won't end there. S&P Global said there was huge uncertainty around the extent, the outcome and the consequences of Russia's war in Ukraine. ""Irrespective of the duration of military hostilities, sanctions and related political risks are likely to remain in place for some time,"" S&P said. ""Potential effects could include dislocated commodities markets--notably for oil and gas--supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, weaker growth, and capital market volatility."" S&P shared several charts that show the extent of the impact to the creditworthiness of Russian companies: Distribution of ratings action related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and energy prices Rating action breakdown by sector Rating action breakdown by rating category Breakdown of rating action by domicile Secondary market credit spreads Read the original article on Business Insider",World/Business Insider,S&P slashed Russia’s debt to junk and says there are already 30 corporate ‘fallen angels’ as a result of the war.

3/21/2022,"Though Fashion Nova founder Richard Saghian's $141-million offer for the mega-mansion known as ""The One"" was the high bid at a bankruptcy auction this month, it may not be enough to close the deal. The event was held within a week of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and creditors disappointed that the winning bid was less than half the home's $295-million list price are asking U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Deborah Saltzman for a do-over. ""It cannot be that the fear of this war and with the potential for World War III ... did not impact [the] bidding auction process,"" Hamid Rafatjoo, the attorney for The One's developer, Nile Niami, said at a Friday hearing. ""That war scared everyone."" Niami, who claims he is owed $44.4 million in loans made to the project, had hoped to assemble a last-minute $250-million offer for the home he considers the culmination of his development career, but that fell apart. Saltzman had been expected to make a decision Friday on whether to approve Saghian's $126-million bid, which totaled $141 million with auction fees. But like most everything else associated with the 105,000-square-foot Bel-Air estate — still unfinished after nearly a decade of construction — things went slower than anticipated. What participants thought would be a short hearing morphed to more than five hours of argument and testimony from attorneys, the home's brokers, Saghian and others. Saltzman, who cited case law that might allow her to set aside a bid if it were deemed ""grossly inadequate,"" said there was too much on the line for her to make a decision on the spot and instead scheduled closing arguments for Monday, when she promised a decision. ""There's been a lot of law discussed. There's been a lot of facts discussed. I do need some time to think,"" she said. The online auction opened Feb. 28, just four days after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, shocking the world while disrupting stock and currency markets. It closed March 3, as Russia's offensive raged on. On one side are Saghian, property owner Crestlloyd, a handful of creditors and others who would benefit from closing the deal — and who say the war is far from the only reason the mansion fetched such a low price. On the other are additional creditors, a couple of which could lose $10 million or more apiece and want a chance on a second auction. The home carries claimed debts that top $250 million. Attorneys for the creditors that oppose the sale have alleged irregularities in the bid procedures and made other legal arguments, but seemed to view the Russian invasion as their trump card, even if they conceded it was unlikely the conflict would end anytime soon. Kyra Andrassy, an attorney for Inferno Investment, which has lodged about $31 million in claims against the estate, compared the war to the coronavirus outbreak, arguing that although the world was stunned in the early days of the pandemic, people eventually learned to live with it. ""Things tend to normalize,"" she told Saltzman. ""I think people adjust."" The prevailing counter-argument was simple: that the situation in the Ukraine might continue or get even worse, meaning there's a chance a new auction would bring in an even lower price. ""It's all speculation what happens tomorrow, next week. World War III happens in two months and we're in this for God knows how long,"" argued Thomas Geher, attorney for Hankey Capital, the real estate lending arm of L.A. billionaire Don Hankey, which lent more than $100 million to Crestlloyd but is first among lenders to be at least partially repaid and supports the sale. There was talk of a new auction being held within the next few months given the cost that comes with keeping the home in bankruptcy, which involves expenses such as upkeep and paying attorneys and other professionals. Sale backers noted that no other bona fide offers had come forward in the weeks since the auction, even though Crestlloyd had said after the auction concluded March 3 that it would welcome further bids. But opponents said that despite a worldwide marketing effort — one broker testified he flew to London and Paris to meet prospective buyers — only five bidders participated in the auction, evidence they said that the war scared away bidders. However, that figure was roughly the number of bidders long expected by Concierge Auctions, the online luxury auction house that conducted the event, according to attorneys in support of Saghian. Those who want to kill the bid also pointed out that Crestlloyd had argued in court papers the 944 Airole Way property was worth $325 million. They also highlighted an appraisal conducted in 2019 while the house was under construction that valued the property at $228 million, evidence they said that the high bid was grossly inadequate. Supporters countered that the appraisal was bloated to boost the home's cachet. Rayni Williams, one of the home's brokers, who will share in commissions totaling about $2.5 million if the sale is approved, acknowledged she was disappointed in the final bid and said she had hoped it would set a record — apparently alluding to the $238 million a hedge fund mogul spent in 2019 for a penthouse overlooking New York's Central Park, a U.S. high-water mark. As it was, the sale didn't even break the California record set by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who purchased a Malibu estate for $177 million in October. Williams testified that she came to learn as she met with prospective buyers that the unfinished home's lack of a certificate of occupancy was an impediment to a sale, which she said probably reduced the number of buyers for a home that already had a tiny buyer pool. ""Buyers usually want — especially at this purchase price — to move right in,"" said Williams, who added that a second auction could be ""very harmful"" as it would ""optically ... look like a failure to the open market."" An obstacle to getting a certificate of occupancy is the stance of the Bel-Air Assn., a homeowners group that sent a letter to Crestlloyd and building officials vowing to investigate alleged construction defects at the mansion and possible zoning violations that came to light when the property was in state receivership last year. The group has already appealed permits given to two other Niami homes and supported residents who sued developer Mohamed Hadid over an illegally constructed Bel-Air mansion now being torn down. Fred Rosen, a board member of the homeowners group, attempted to speak at the hearing but was not allowed to do so after objections that he had no standing. However, Concierge Auctions President Chad Roffers seemed to bear out some of the group's concerns when he testified that the mansion was damaged by the record rainfalls in late December, forcing Crestlloyd to scramble to make fixes so it could be shown. He also said the lack of a certificate of occupancy and the association's involvement with getting the Hadid house torn down was a red flag to ""highly qualified buyers."" ""As they started to peel back the layer, you know, of the onion, and start to understand the complexity and uncertainty in terms of a path to a C of O, it became a greater and greater head wind,"" Roffers said. ""I was on the phone with a potential bidder the day of the auction in London who was interested, however, ultimately were totally freaked out by the lack of C of O and then the publicity around the Hadid property."" He also noted, however, that the $141-million bid was 48% of the list price, which he said was the exact same discount at which Niami's last three homes sold. ""In preparing for this I was doing my homework on recent transactions,"" he said. ""It's uncanny."" If the bid is not approved, Saghian's attorney, Sam Newman, warned that the fashion mogul may ""lose interest and move on to the next thing."" Saghian, recently deemed a billionaire by Forbes, already owns two area homes, one in the Hollywood Hills he bought for $17.5 million in 2018 and another on a Malibu beach that he purchased for $14.7 million last year. Newman said his client was recently made aware of a Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety notice potentially ordering The One's roof removed. The Times viewed a copy of the notice, which alleges the building and stair and elevator tower projections exceed height limits and need to be rectified. It also states the property owner can seek a permit to allow the structures. Saghian's attorney warned that his client was facing a more complex situation than he expected when he made the winning bid. ""No one knows how much more money will have to be poured into this property,"" Newman said. Even so, when Saghian was sworn in to testify, he seemed almost giddy about the prospect of owning the house. Saltzman asked him about a peculiarity of the auction that has caused some wonder: Why, after he placed a winning $120-million bid that no one had topped, did he bid again for $126 million? Roffers testified the move was not uncommon and was called a ""power bid"" meant to scare away any more competition. Saghian had another answer. ""I took a couple of seconds to think about it and I picked my lucky number,"" he said. ""It's 26. Sounds pretty crazy. But when I got the house I thought it was meant to be.""

3/21/2022,"Alaska lawmakers are assuring a Russian official who said the U.S. should return Alaska and other areas to Russia that it's just not happening. Russian parliament member Oleg Matveychev on a TV program addressed waves of sanctions against Russia in response to the country’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, saying leaders should “think about reparations.” “The harm these sanctions caused us cost money. Return of possessions, including possessions of the Russian Empire, Soviet Union and even parts of Russia that are now occupied by the United States,” Matveychev said on Sunday, according to the Anchorage Daily News. The host of the show asked Matveychev about the return of Alaska and Fort Ross, which was established by Russians in California, according to the California Department of Parks and Recreation. “This is my next point – recognizing Alaska, Fort Ross and Antarctica,” Matveychev responded, according to the Anchorage Daily News. “We actually discovered it, so it rightfully belongs to us.” The United States reached an agreement to purchase Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million in 1867. Alaska was admitted as a state in 1959. Republican Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski balked at the statement, tweeting coverage of the comments and a gif of Taylor Swift with the caption “That will never, ever, ever happen!” World: Doesn't Ukrainian President Zelenskyy 'own a suit?' Economist asks and gets slammed on Twitter Russian invasion: Zelenskyy asked U.S. Congress to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine. What does that mean? Alaska Gov.

We have hundreds of thousands of armed Alaskans and military members that will see it differently,” he added.

3/21/2022,"The Canary Islands are located off the south coast of Morocco. This Spanish territory, about four hours flight from the major population centers of northern Europe, fills up this time of year with tourists looking to escape the cold. Americans are virtually nonexistent, but over a two week stay I have met many French, German, and British travelers as well as Dutch, Swiss, Slovenes and others. With Russian forces brutally attacking democratic Ukraine, the mood is one of shock and some degree of bewilderment. Like many Americans, lulled by the idea that we have created a more perfect world, this return to 20th century style military aggression is hard for them to accept. There is talk of Vladimir Putin being Hitleresque but the main question seems to be, how can this be happening? Before going any further I invite you to reread a column I wrote in May of 2021 (""McCord: The threats we face""). Since then our national disunity has worsened. The disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan was taken as a statement by our enemies, who have also likely calculated that we are more concerned with limiting oil and gas production, renaming schools, relaxing penalties for criminal behavior and pursuing various other aspects of “wokeism” than in defending and strengthening a world order designed to promote democracy and the integrity of sovereign nations. Those few of us familiar with what happened in Europe from 1944 into the early 50s see echoes of the USSR that Putin seems so intent on reestablishing in some form. After Stalin so effectively conned the dying Roosevelt in Yalta with his web of lies, and the Red Army swept out of Russia toward Berlin, embedded elements of the NKVD (predecessor to the KGB) were left behind to eliminate democratic institutions and civil society and put in place the compliant Soviet puppet governments that controlled all of central Europe until 30+ years ago. The unrelenting will of our country played a significant role in undoing all that. That will is threatened by people willing to cancel anything that does not suit the “progressive” agenda. According to Newsweek magazine, no less a luminary than the President of France, Emanuel Macron, ""said American-imported 'woke culture' is 'racializing' France and creating more division among minorities.” The NY Times has quoted him citing “Certain social science theories entirely imported from the United States…,” and further blaming U S universities for “the ethnicization of the social question,” amounting to “breaking the republic in two.” Another element of the debate in France is, the racial and ethnic focus of “woke” culture is policing what people can and cannot say, extending even to which Halloween costumes are or are not politically acceptable, thereby stifling free speech and the free exchange of ideas. The result? Our national power and prestige are undermined. Francois Cusset, a French expert on American civilization sees “…the sign of a small, frightened republic, declining, provincializing….”  These are not right wing fringe ideas but are widely held at the highest levels of the French government, foreign policy establishment and leading media. Shouldn’t we be giving this close consideration? So the Russian armies roll into Ukraine. Putin has made thinly veiled threats of employing his nuclear forces. He has stated that the dissolution of the Soviet Union was “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the (20th) century.” It seems he thinks our self absorption and internecine conflict give him the opportunity to go back to the future. Meanwhile the Chinese connive with him, and with their newly acquired ability to project offensive military power, send their forces to intimidate and encroach on democratic Taiwan. We have taken much for granted in our effort to create a state of social perfection in our country. Our leadership seems to have little concern that the rush to the “progressive” agenda is actively undermining much of what has made us great. I do not blame the events in Ukraine on our government, but the words of Cusset ring true to me and our enemies around the world have been eager to exploit our inward focus and the decline in our national will.
