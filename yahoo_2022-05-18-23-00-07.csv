5/18/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) -Russia on Wednesday said it was using a new generation of powerful laser weapons in Ukraine to burn up drones, deploying some of Moscow's secret weapons to counter a flood of Western arms supplied to its former Soviet neighbour. President Vladimir Putin in 2018 unveiled an array of new weapons including a new intercontinental ballistic missile, underwater nuclear drones, a supersonic weapon and a new laser weapon. Little is known about the specifics of the new laser weapons. Putin mentioned one called Peresvet, named after a medieval Orthodox warrior monk Alexander Peresvet who perished in mortal combat. Yury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told a conference in Moscow that Peresvet was already being widely deployed and it could blind satellites up to 1,500 km above Earth. He said, though, that there were already more powerful Russian systems than Peresvet that could burn up drones and other equipment. Borisov cited a test on Tuesday which he said had burned up a drone 5 km away within five seconds. ""If Peresvet blinds, then the new generation of laser weapons lead to the physical destruction of the target - thermal destruction, they burn up,"" Borisov told Russian state television. Asked if such weapons were being used in Ukraine, Borisov said: ""Yes. The first prototypes are already being used there."" He said the weapon was called ""Zadira"". Almost nothing is publicly known about Zadira but in 2017 Russian media said Russia's state nuclear corporation, Rosatom, helped develop it as part of a programme to create weapons-based new physical principles, known by the Russian acronym ONFP. Putin's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has illustrated the limits of Russia's post-Soviet conventional armed forces, though he says the ""special military operation"" is going to plan and will achieve all of Moscow's aims. The United States has ruled out sending its own or NATO forces to Ukraine but Washington and its allies have supplied billions of dollars of weapons to Kyiv such as drones, Howitzer heavy artillery, anti-aircraft Stinger and anti-tank Javelin missiles. Putin casts such large arms shipments as part of a broader plan by the United States to destroy Russia - and has promised that it will never succeed. Borisov's remarks indicate that Russia has made significant progress with laser weapons, a trend of considerable interest to other nuclear powers such as the United States and China. Using lasers to blind satellites - or even burn them up - was once a fantasy from the realm of science fiction, but major powers such as the United States, China and Russia have been working on variants of such weapons for years. Besides the benefits in conventional warfare of burning up drones, blinding reconnaissance systems has a strategic impact too as satellites are used to monitor intercontinental ballistic missiles which carry nuclear weapons. Borisov said he had just returned from Sarov, a closed town in the Nizhny Novgorod region once known as Arzamas-16 because it was so secret, which is a centre of Russia's nuclear weapons research. He said a new generation of laser weapons using a wide electromagnetic band would ultimately replace conventional weapons. ""This is not some sort of exotic idea; it is the reality,"" Borisov said.

5/18/2022,"ROMAN PETRENKO Russia's Deputy Prime Minister, Yuri Borisov, has said that Russia cannot be the first to strike a nuclear strike. Source: Borisov, quoted by the Russian information group ""Interfax"" Details: Borisov referred to the military doctrine of a nuclear strike, which reportedly forbids Russia to be the first to launch a nuclear strike. Quote from Borisov: ""According to our doctrine, according to our strategy, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation would use a nuclear strike only in retaliation. According to the doctrine, we would not be the first to attack. Our president, the commander-in-chief, has two naval officers carrying a so-called nuclear suitcase nearby at all times. In the case of threats detected by air and space defence and missile attack warning systems, in the event of a launch, the fact of the attack, its trajectory, and the location of the crash would be determined - these are the criteria for retaliation."" For reference: But he is lying. According to Russia's military doctrine, the country reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in response to the use of nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies, as well as in the event of aggression against Russia with conventional weapons, ""if the very existence of the State is threatened"". Background : The pumping of weapons by NATO countries into Ukraine increases the possibility of transition to a full-fledged nuclear war, said the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev. According to the US National Intelligence Chief, Avril Haines, President Vladimir Putin is ready to use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine if the defeat of his troops in Ukraine cannot be hidden. According to the Financial Times, Western governments are already questioning Russia's readiness for nuclear escalation, and therefore have accelerated the supply of heavy weapons to Ukraine. The leadership of the North Atlantic Alliance has no information that Russia is preparing a nuclear strike on Ukraine. The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, William Burns, also said there was no clear evidence of a nuclear strike in Ukraine.",World/Ukrayinska Pravda,Putin is assured that he cannot be the first to launch a nuclear strike,https://news.yahoo.com/putin-assured-cannot-first-launch-091000953.html

And it's that situation that we need to get out of."" Vladimir Putin's position in Ukraine will ""frankly get worse"", a Russian defence expert has said on state TV, as he warned: ""The entire world is against us."" Putin ordered his troops to invade on 24 February, but while Western intelligence suggested he anticipated his takeover to take a matter of days, he is now in the third month of conflict. On Monday Ukrainian authorities claimed they'd taken pushed the Russians away from their second-largest city Kharkiv. UK intelligence services also said Russia may have lost a third of the invasion force it sent into Ukraine as its offensive continues to struggle in the face of stiff resistance. The attack has also prompted Finland and Sweden to look to join Nato, prompting the Kremlin’s deputy foreign minister Sergey Ryabkov to admit Russia's invasion is now “significantly behind schedule”. In its latest assessment, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the Russian campaign in the east of Ukraine had “lost momentum”.

""Let's look at the situation as a whole from the overall strategic position,"" he said. ""Don't engage in saber-rattling with missiles in Finland's direction. It actually looks very amusing. After all, the main deficiency of our military-political position is that, in a way, we are in full geopolitical isolation, and that, however much we would hate to admit this, virtually the entire world is against us. And it's that situation that we need to get out of,"" he said. On the information being given to the Russian people, Khodaryonok urged caution over what they were being shown by their own media. He said: ""First of all, I must say that we shouldn't take information tranquillisers because sometimes information is spread some moral and psychological breakdown in the Ukrainian armed forces which are allegedly on the verge of some kind of crisis in morale and so on. ""All of that, to put it mildly, is false. Of course, there are certain cases, prisoners of war, certain units but they're individual cases. ""But as we've just said we should always look at the matter as a whole."" Khodaryonok added that the Ukrainian defence forces are being armed from abroad, and ""the situation from the overall strategic position is that the Ukrainian armed forces are able to arm a million people. They're saying it themselves, that 'for us, there's no difficulty mobilising a million people'."" He added: ""And considering that there is the European aid will fully come into effect, so a million armed Ukrainian soldiers need to be viewed as a reality of the very near future. ""And we need to take that into account in our operational and strategic calculations, that the situation in this regard for us will frankly get worse."" Russia's prolonged invasion has caused a humanitarian crisis, with over 6 million people having fled into neighbouring countries to avoid Putin's bombs. Russian troops have been repeatedly accused of committing war crimes, with some experts claiming rape and sexual crimes are being used as a ""strategy"" in the war. Nato deputy secretary-general Mircea Geoana said the Ukrainians were now in a position to defeat the Russians and win the war. “The brutal invasion of Russia is losing momentum,” he told reporters. “With significant support from allies and partners in billions of dollars, in military support, in financial support, humanitarian support, we know that with the bravery of the Ukrainian people and army and with our help, Ukraine can win this war.”",World/Yahoo News UK,Russian defence expert admits on state TV: 'The entire world is against us',https://news.yahoo.com/russian-columnist-admits-tv-world-against-us-101932599.html
5/18/2022,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A 21-year-old Russian soldier facing the first war crimes trial since Moscow invaded Ukraine pleaded guilty Wednesday to killing an unarmed civilian. Sgt. Vadim Shishimarin could get life in prison for shooting a a 62-year-old Ukrainian man in the head through an open car window in the northeastern Sumy region on Feb. 28, four days into the invasion. Shishimarin, a captured member of a Russian tank unit, was prosecuted under a section of the Ukrainian criminal code that addresses the laws and customs of war. Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova previously said her office was readying war crimes cases against 41 Russian soldiers for offenses that included bombing civilian infrastructure, killing civilians, rape and looting. It was not immediately clear how many of the suspects are in Ukrainian hands and how many would be tried in absentia. Prosecutors plan to continue presenting evidence against Shishimarin following his guilty plea, although the trial is like to be shorter. As the inaugural war-crimes case in Ukraine, Shishimarin’s prosecution was being watched closely. Investigators have been collecting evidence of possible war crimes to bring before the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Venediktova’s office has said it was looking into more than 10,700 potential war crimes involving more than 600 suspects, including Russian soldiers and government officials. With help from foreign experts, prosecutors are investigating allegations that Russian troops violated Ukrainian and international law by killing, torturing and abusing possibly thousands of Ukrainian civilians. Shishimarin's trial opened Friday, when he made a brief court appearance while lawyers and judges discussed prosecedural matters. After his plea on Wednesday, the proceedings were continued until Thursday, when the trial is expecgted to resume in a large courtroom to accomodate more journalists. Ukrainian authorities posted a few details on social media last week from their investigation in his case. Shishimarin was among a group of Russian troops that fled Ukrainian forces on Feb. 28, according to Venediktova’s Facebook account. The Russians allegedly fired at a private car and seized the vehicle, then drove to Chupakhivka, a village about 200 miles east of Kyiv. On the way, the prosecutor-general alleged, the Russian soldiers saw a man walking on the sidewalk and talking on his phone. Shyshimarin was ordered to kill the man so he wouldn’t be able to report them to Ukrainian military authorities. Venediktova did not identify who gave the order. Shyshimarin fired his Kalashnikov rifle through the open window and hit the victim in the head, Venediktova wrote. “The man died on the spot just a few dozen meters from his house,” she said. The Security Service of Ukraine, known as the SBU, posted a short video on May 4 of Shyshimarin speaking in front of camera and briefly describing how he shot the man. The SBU described the video as “one of the first confessions of the enemy invaders.” “I was ordered to shoot,” Shyshimarin said. “I shot one (round) at him. He falls. And we kept on going.” Russia is believed to be preparing war crime trials for Ukrainian soldiers. ___ Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,Russian soldier pleads guilty at Ukraine war crimes trial,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-soldier-pleads-guilty-ukraine-125357699.html
