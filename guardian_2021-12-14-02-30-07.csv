12/14/2021,"Nearly a third of British companies that import goods from the EU are “not at all prepared” for full post-Brexit customs checks, according to a survey of business leaders, sparking fears of increased congestion at ports and worsening supply chain disruption. From 1 January 2022, companies that import goods will no longer be able to take advantage of a temporary six-month grace period allowing them to delay making customs declarations to HMRC and paying any tariffs due. Instead, they will have to do so immediately.  Three in 10 of the leaders of firms that import from the EU polled by the Institute of Directors (IoD) said they were not at all prepared for the change, with 37% of small businesses and nearly a quarter of large ones saying they were not ready. Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the IoD, said: “In just three weeks’ time, significant changes to our customs arrangements are going to be introduced, for which a large portion of businesses are either unprepared or simply unaware. “This will exacerbate existing supply chain problems, leading to further congestion at ports, as well as extra costs from accidental non-compliance for many businesses. “Government needs to ramp up an awareness and advertising campaign around these changes, simplifying the guidance, so that all importing businesses feel confident they know how to keep supplies flowing into the new year.” Amanda Barnes, chief executive of media and events business Faversham House, said the upcoming changes were already causing problems. “Our issue with import controls is more from the perspective of how it is affecting our overseas and UK exhibitors who are trying to bring pieces of equipment and machinery into the UK to exhibit at our shows,” she said. “There is loads of confusion out there and the costs of temporarily importing goods to show at exhibitions has become so prohibitive that some of our exhibitors are downsizing their stands or trying to cancel. “The paperwork too is putting them off. I think it will be a real barrier to trade in the short term at least.” The IoD surveyed 580 of its members and after removing those firms that said the EU import rule changes were “not applicable” to them, the results were based on the responses of the remaining 250 business leaders. Members were also asked what they would most like to see improved about the business environment they face. The UK’s new trading relationship with the EU was the number one issue, with 16% of votes, with skills shortages second at 15% and the UK’s economic situation third with 12%.

12/14/2021,"It is hard to disagree with John Harris’s devastating assessment of Boris Johnson (Boris Johnson’s crises boil down to one thing: contempt for the rest of us, 12 December). Except, perhaps, when he writes that Johnson is “so arrogant and thoughtless that he sometimes seems almost amoral”. Surely, his amorality is proven beyond all reasonable doubt? It was on display on Sunday night when, not for the first time, he contemptuously bypassed parliament with his pre-recorded, question-avoiding “national address” on television. It was Boris the wannabe president, not a primus inter pares prime minister.  Whether or not one regards his latest restrictions as too little, too much or just about right, it also reeked of diversion and distraction designed to try to diffuse his “partygate”, “curtaingate” and revolting Tory MPs crises. Not to mention his plunging personal poll ratings. The only reaction of those of us who wrote and broadcast that the Johnson we knew was unfit to be prime minister (well in advance of him achieving his obsessive ambition) is to say: “Quelle surprise.” But those senior Tory politicians who privately confided (for a book I co-authored just as Johnson became prime minister) that they only voted for him as party leader while holding their noses because of his “campaigning magic” but dreaded his integrity and ability in a major crisis, have serious questions to ask themselves. It involves accepting that the fabled Teflon flak jacket has worn dangerously thin and the time to finally pierce it beyond repair has come.Paul ConnewSt Albans, Hertfordshire  To the many charges laid against the prime minister (of incompetence, corruption, duplicity, misogyny, racism and now John Harris’s clinical dissection of his contempt for the rest of us), we can add a hypocrisy so fundamental and all-encompassing that it defies belief. He has chosen to bet everything on vaccination and yet more reliance on the NHS. This ignores a rational approach to a pandemic that would also have included prevention of disease and a comprehensive programme of testing and contact tracing. The first, a public health approach, has been effectively impeded by a decade of austerity and cuts to local services. The second has been transfigured into the shambles of bad management and outsourcing. Meanwhile, Johnson’s party has spent the last 10 years dismantling the NHS, leaving it short of 100,000 staff and 17,000 beds, and adding to the insult of clapping its heroic staff by denying it a pay rise. It has also, unbelievably, under Sajid Javid, blamed doctors for the very problems caused by the Tories. Johnson boasts that we were the first country in the world to counter Covid with a vaccination programme. He failed to add that his party has been the first to destroy our public health service, hamper a Covid prevention programme through cronyism, contract health supply to a former pub manager, and go on holiday instead of undertaking emergency planning. It won’t be good enough to get rid of him to solve the nation’s various crises; his party and ideology are rotten to the core. No amount of boosting will stifle the anger felt towards their contemptible wickedness.Kevin DonovanBirkenhead, Merseyside  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

12/14/2021,"Virgin Atlantic owners Sir Richard Branson and Delta have pumped another £400m into the struggling carrier, as the spread of the Omicron variant and growing travel restrictions spread gloom around airline investors. Red list travel restrictions have forced Virgin to scrap the reopening of key South African winter sun routes, as well as hitting its Lagos service, while the reintroduction of PCR testing for all travellers to the UK has hit the sector more broadly.  While Virgin had been recently boosted by the reopening of the transatlantic route, and insists it anticipates a return to profitability from 2023, Branson and Delta have had to dig deeper to bolster the airline and allow it to pay down debt. Shai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, said that both shareholders and creditors had “been a source of unwavering support” during the pandemic, with an earlier £1.2bn recapitalisation in September 2020 bringing the airline back from the brink. Delta’s chief executive, Ed Bastian, said that Virgin Atlantic’s business had now transformed, “allowing them to emerge from the pandemic a stronger airline”. Weiss joined other UK airline bosses in signing a joint letter to the prime minister objecting to the “disproportionate and haphazard” policies hitting customers and businesses. About £1bn combined was wiped off the market value of easyJet, Ryanair, and British Airways’ owner IAG on Monday. All saw share prices fall as investors digested news of cancelled holidays and the prospect of mounting travel restrictions hitting consumer confidence. The airlines called on Boris Johnson to scrap the emergency testing regime for international travellers, given the spread of the latest Covid variant in the UK, and provide bespoke economic support for the sector to help it through the crisis. The letter said: “As leaders of UK airlines, we are deeply concerned about the haphazard and disproportionate approach by government to travel restrictions following the emergence of the Omicron variant … Pre-departure and upon-arrival testing clearly add very little value to our Covid protection, but unnecessarily disrupt Christmas for families as well as businesses while severely damaging the UK travel industry.” The airline bosses urged the government to “prevent the permanent scarring of our industry” by removing the requirement for fully vaccinated passengers to test, when the policy is formally reviewed on 20 December, and to tackle the inflated prices and poor provision of private PCR tests. They added: “We and our customers feel sincerely let down, having believed a more pragmatic, evidence-led approach to travel, in line with the rest of the world, had been achieved and agreed by all concerned just a few months ago.”",News/Business,Owners pump £400m into Virgin Atlantic amid Omicron gloom,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/13/owners-pump-400m-into-virgin-atlantic-amid-omicron-gloom
12/14/2021,"The Golden Globes nomination list has been announced with a solemn introduction from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s president Helen Hoehne, to the effect that the Globes’ much-criticised controlling body was “trying to be better” and that its constituent membership was more diverse than at any other time in its history. Which is better, I suppose, than being less diverse than at any time in its history. At any rate, leading the pack are Belfast, Kenneth Branagh’s unashamed heartwarmer about the home town of his early childhood, with seven nominations and Jane Campion’s stark, twisty western-Gothic psychodrama The Power of the Dog, set in 1920s Montana with Benedict Cumberbatch as the troubled, angry cattleman who begins a toxic duel with his new sister-in-law played by Kirsten Dunst and her sensitive teenage son, played by Kodi Smit-McPhee.  Campion’s brilliant, haunting drama has the amplitude and seriousness which may well convince the Globe voters that this is a major movie – which I think it unquestionably is, as it takes the tropes and forms of the western and contorts them with novel ideas about sexuality and dysfunction. And it has what so few movies of any sort have – a really satisfying and unexpected ending. Branagh’s Belfast, which coolly declines to conform to the accepted expressions of anger and misery long considered essential in dramatising the Troubles, got itself some social media mockery from some. But its heartfelt generosity and tenderness won my heart and I am not at all surprised, and rather pleased, to see it in a commanding position. Coming up behind, the story is a little different. It is a bit heartsinking to see Adam McKay’s extremely moderate apocalyptic climate-crisis satire Don’t Look Up pick up four nominations, ahead of so many superior movies. It is the beneficiary of the Globes’ “musical or comedy” category which, though a good thing in and of itself, is probably very generous to a movie that thinks it’s funnier and more meaningful than it actually is. And I have to say I am a bit baffled by Aaron Sorkin’s strained Being the Ricardos getting three nominations), with its imagining of backstage office politics in the production of the 50s TV classic I Love Lucy with Nicole Kidman conscientiously but implausibly impersonating Lucille Ball. On the other hand Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story is such a wonderful movie, though hampered by some critical meh-ing and disappointing box office news. I’m hoping that some of its four nominations will be converted into wins, though in the best musical or comedy category it is up against one of my favourite films at the moment, one that I could imagine watching every day for the next six months: Paul Thomas Anderson’s miraculous 70s LA age-gap comedy romance Licorice Pizza. I wouldn’t bet against Will Smith getting the best actor Globe for his starring role in King Richard: a rich, smooth and effortlessly charming true-life drama about the formidable and driven Richard Williams, coach and dad to the legendary tennis sisters Venus and Serena Williams. Smith, however, is up against really tough opposition in the form of Mahershala Ali who gives a very thoughtful and absorbing performance in Benjamin Cleary’s Frankenheimian sci-fi mystery Swan Song, as well as Denzel Washington as Macbeth in Joel Coen’s stark monochrome reading of the Shakespeare play. Further down the list, I am disappointed to see David Lowery’s superb prog-rock Arthurian fantasy The Green Knight get zero nominations and there might also be some critical tearfall over a similar snub to Mike Mills’s C’mon C’mon– though I was less impressed than others by this self-consciously sensitive film. There might be some eyebrows raised (like mine) over Ruth Negga (justifiably) getting a nomination for her excellent performance in Rebecca Hall’s Passing, but not her co-star Tessa Thompson. On the best actress – drama list my betting is on the outrageous Lady Gaga in House of Gucci. Nobody brings the drama like LG, but this film should really have been in the musical or comedy category – though perhaps putting it with the serious films perpetuates the joke. Kristen Stewart is tipped for silverware by many for her role in the entertaining if fundamentally silly drama Spencer, imagining Princess Diana’s dire final Christmas with the royals. Olivia Colman is superb in The Lost Daughter, and this could be another triumph for her.So a very reasonable Globes list, with the oddest of odd couples, Campion and Branagh, poised to clean up.",Arts/Film,Golden Globes 2022 tries to do better as Lady Gaga brings the outrage,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/13/golden-globes-2022-tries-to-do-better-as-lady-gaga-brings-the-outrage
12/14/2021,"Earlier today I set you three questions from a Russian maths competition used to promote the International Congress of Mathematicians, which will be held in July next year in St Petersburg. 1. Pet swap  A cat is sitting on the table and a tortoise is crawling on the floor directly beneath it. The distance from the cat’s ears to the top of the tortoise’s shell is 170 cm. Alena switched her pets around. Now the distance from the cat’s ears to the top of the tortoise’s shell is 130 cm. What is the height of the table? Solution: 150 cm Put the table from the first picture on the table from the second picture so that the tortoises are aligned. Then the distance from the ears of the bottom cat to the ears of the top cat will be 130 + 170 = 300 cm. This distance is equal to twice the height of the table, hence the answer is 150 cm. 2. Circular thinking Volodya is running around a circular track at a constant speed. At two of the points on the track are two yellow marks. When he started his run, Volodya was closer to the first yellow mark for 2 minutes, then he was closer to the second yellow mark for 3 minutes, and then he was closer to the first yellow mark again. How long does it take Volodya to run one full circle? Solution 6 minutes. Denote the first and second yellow marks as A and B. Let points C and D mark a diameter such that every point on CD is equidistant from A and B. What you are doing is cutting the circle in half such that all points on one side are closer to A and all points on the other are closer to B. If he is closer to B for 3 minutes, this must mean that he runs the CBD arc in 3 minutes. Consequently, he runs the entire circle in 6 minutes. The fact that Volodya was closer to the first mark for the first two minutes is not necessary to determine the time in which he runs a full circle. 3. Path of glory Olga must walk through the 3x3 gird below left, moving either horizontally or vertically from cell to cell, and not entering any cell more than once. Below right shows one possible path. If Olga writes down the digits she passes in order during this path, she would get the number 84937561. What is the largest number possible it is possible for Olga to write down during a path through the grid? Solution 573618492. First, note that a nine-digit number will be larger than a number with fewer digits. So, we will look for the answer among the nine-digit numbers. Next, it is clear that the highest number is the one that starts with the highest digit. If the square is colored as a chessboard as shown left then the colour of the cells should alternate when walking on the chosen path. Since we have five white cells and four black cells, the walk must start with a white cell. The largest number in the white cells is 5. At each step you need to maximize the next digit position, that is, go to the cell with the largest possible digit. This principle determines the following numbers, 7 and 3. The maximum number among the neighbors of number 3 is 9. But if you go to cell 9, you will not be able to complete the path – the square will break into two unconnected areas. You can’t go from 3 to 8 for the same reason. So, you have to go to 6. The way forward is unambiguous: 573618492. Thanks to the ICM 2022 for letting me use the puzzles.

12/14/2021,"Headteachers are warning of “chaos” in England’s schools as Omicron sweeps across the country, with high levels of staff and pupil absences and reports that parents are planning to keep children home to avoid the virus before Christmas. School leaders and unions urged the government to introduce more protective measures, including masks in classrooms, better ventilation and tougher isolation rules to try to slow the spread of the virus before the holidays.  In areas with high infection rates, some year groups are being sent home to study remotely because not enough teachers or supply teachers are available, and a small number of schools have been forced to move online until the end of term. In some schools up to half the teaching workforce is unavailable for work due to Covid-related absence, according to the NASUWT union, which is calling for a staggered start to the new term and additional on-site testing facilities in January. Dr Patrick Roach, the NASUWT general secretary, wrote to the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, on Monday calling for immediate action. “We ask you to avoid a repeat of the confusion and chaos which last year impacted negatively on public and parental confidence and hampered the hard work of teachers and school and college leaders in their preparations at the start of 2021,” he said. “An immediate announcement from the government on additional measures for schools and colleges is, we believe, essential before the majority of schools and colleges close for the Christmas break.” Last year the government took legal action against Greenwich council in London to try to force schools to remain open in the run-up to Christmas. It was forced into a U-turn in January, closing schools in England to all but key worker and vulnerable children as the pandemic continued to take its toll. On Monday Zahawi called for high booster uptake to help protect education. He added: “There is no evidence to suggest we are going to need to close our schools and colleges.” Speaking on LBC, however, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, admitted the government could not guarantee schools would remain open. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of National Association of Head Teachers, welcomed “a bit of realism”. He said: “It is already chaos in some schools as the Omicron wave hits. Delaying action until vaccination can take hold may actually keep children away from school longer in the long-term. “The government must act now to deliver ventilation solutions, sensible and effective isolation protocols, and lift the unnecessary pressure of inspection and other bureaucratic burdens. That way we can concentrate on keeping children where they should be.” Pupils at two schools in Bury St Edmunds began home learning this week after two suspected cases of the Omicron variant were identified. Abbots Green academy and Sybil Andrews academy, both part of the Unity Schools Partnership, made the decision following consultation with Suffolk’s public health team and the UK Health Security Agency, the East Anglian Daily Times reported. Unions, meanwhile, have been told that some parents are planning to keep their children out of school to avoid infection ruining Christmas. “That’s by no means widespread, but it shows the level of concern out there,” a union representative said. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the omens were not good. “The situation varies wildly from school to school but high numbers of students absent from the classroom are being compounded by significant numbers of teachers who are also at home ill. “We know schools are trying their very best to minimise the impact but, in extreme cases, these two factors have resulted in whole year groups being sent home as there are simply not enough teachers to cover all classes.”",News/World news,"Heads warn of Omicron chaos in English schools, with staff and pupils absent",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/heads-warn-of-omicron-chaos-in-english-schools-with-staff-and-pupils-absent
12/14/2021,"When Tony Hunter first shakes your hand, he holds your gaze a long time, calmly sizing you up, perhaps looking for a common bond. His outback New South Wales drawl is slow, but his mind feels fully engaged. Tell him he looks a lot younger than his 69 years and he looks sceptical: “I lost 10 years to alcohol in there.” Twenty-seven years ago Hunter and his partner, Melinda Bonham, were sitting on the porch of their house in Shalvey, a suburb of Blacktown, when Hunter fell silent, lost in thought. It was 1994, and the local Aboriginal community had endured a long cycle of drug and alcohol addiction, trauma and premature death. After a while, Hunter spoke: “I’ve gotta do something to help my people.”  Marrin Weejali Aboriginal Corporation. Marrin Weejali Aboriginal Corporation was born out of that thought. As Hunter strolls around Marrin Weejali’s crowded two-storey building in Blackett, near Mount Druitt, he introduces Rob and Brian, drug and alcohol counsellors. Another man, Drew, simply walks up, shakes hands, and identifies himself as a recovering alcoholic: “I can’t say enough for what Marrin has done for me,” he says. An outsider cannot easily tell counsellors from clients, which is not surprising, since six of the centre’s 10 counsellors, along with Hunter, were once addicts themselves. In the back courtyard, Hunter introduces another worker, Steve. “I found him on the side of the road chasing a lizard,” Hunter says. The reference is mysterious to all but Steve, who laughs, and lingers to chat. No one is in a hurry; everyone seems to have time, and to have come through a great trial. Established by Hunter and Bonham in 1996, Marrin Weejali is Sydney’s only Aboriginal-run drug and alcohol service. In Wiradjuri, the most widely spoken Aboriginal language in NSW, marrin means body and spirit, weejali means essence. The goal is to unite these two in the one person. Marrin’s core philosophy grows out of the therapeutic community model and programs such as Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous, which are built on the belief that people sharing their common experience can solve their common problem. L-R Michael, Chris and Brian chatting with Marrin Weejali counsellor Brian Hunter Groups meet to discuss not only addiction but mental health, family planning, anger management, and domestic violence. While some are for Kooris only, others are open to all; Marrin Weejali takes anyone who walks through the door. While 80% to 90% of clients are Indigenous, others have white, Islander and South Sudanese backgrounds. “We can’t say no to these non-Aboriginal people, because they grew up with Aboriginal people,” Hunter says. “If you went to school with an Aboriginal fella and he comes in here, where are you going to go? You become part of the Aboriginal community.” In 1823, governor Macquarie established a native institution in the area in order to effect what he called “the civilisation of the Aborigines of NSW”. It was one of the first public policies “aimed at eliminating Aboriginal cultural traditions and enforcing assimilation with a European way of life,” according to the Blacktown Native Institution Project. In time, people called the place Blacktown. The local government area of Blacktown city contains nearly 400,000 people – 40% of them born overseas. Residents come from 188 countries and speak 182 languages, according to the Blacktown city council website. What makes Blacktown exceptionally diverse is that it also holds Australia’s largest urban Indigenous population: more than 10,000 people, and nearly 5% of the population in Mount Druitt, which is part of Blacktown local government area. For Aboriginal people, Blacktown marks a place of sorrow, of being severed from their ancient life. In these times of statue-toppling and cancel culture, of renaming places and recasting the past in light of present values, the name of Blacktown might have been considered a candidate for the chop. Far from it. Local high school children walking home in Shalvey. In 2015, Liberal Party members of Blacktown council campaigned to change the name of the municipality to western Sydney. Councillor Jess Diaz told Guardian Australia that Blacktown should be “a modern metropolis which people will embrace, aspirational people. The branding of Blacktown is a negative for many developers. I think we should try and give the city a positive name.” Leaders of the Darug people, on whose land Blacktown stands, fiercely objected. They liked the name and the link with their history, however tragic, and it turned out that the people of Blacktown agreed. In a council survey of more than 3,000 residents, 80% voted against changing the name. Blacktown’s Indigenous residents comprise the Darug and a larger group – made up of Wiradjuri people and others who moved from country NSW – and their descendants. It is one of Australia’s great migration stories, rarely told. In the 1960s, many Aboriginal people saw an opportunity to leave behind the oppression of the missions and small towns of outback NSW, and to start a new life in the city. Aboriginal leader Chicka Dixon called it a mass migration “from the riverbanks to Sydney”. These journeys were no less difficult, in many ways more so, than those made by newcomers from overseas, writes Western Sydney University sociologist George Morgan. Many of these migrants arrived in Mount Druitt just as the state government opened the area to public housing. A Housing for Aborigines program was established in 1969. The modernist planning principles of the time sought to clear what were seen as the cramped and unhygienic slums of the inner cities. In new outer suburbs, more spacious houses, quiet streets and big backyards with trees would lead to better lives. But as early as 1969, a local state MP warned that population was running way ahead of planning. “There are thousands of children in the area, no playing fields, no meeting places, nothing for teenagers to do, and inadequate transport facilities to take them anywhere.” These problems dog the area even today. Michael has been attending Merran Weejali for more than three months since realising he had an addiction and he needed to do something to change that. Many families did see their material conditions improve. But there was a catch, writes Morgan. “Prospective housing commission tenants from all social backgrounds – Anglo working class, migrant, Indigenous – had to demonstrate they were capable of living in a manner deemed respectable by those petty officials who assessed their applications.” These pressures fell especially heavily on Indigenous people, Morgan writes. Having been told for generations that their culture and ways of life were worthless, most “naturally felt exposed and inadequate when they moved into suburban housing”. Neighbours watched them closely; the commission discouraged visits by relatives; a woman was twice threatened with eviction because her lawn was not cut. Morgan writes of women, whose male partners were often absent, who succeeded beyond expectations. “They struggled assiduously to keep their houses cleaner than those around them. They dressed their children neatly and respectfully. They were strong and held families together.” One of the Aboriginal women who moved to Sydney and into Mount Druitt public housing was Connie Hunter, along with her son Tony, then 20, and his seven siblings. On a warm Wednesday in April, Hunter sits down to tell his story. He speaks very slowly, laughing sometimes, pausing often, occasionally closing his eyes and remembering. Hunter and his brothers and sisters grew up in a tin humpy on the banks of the Barwon River, in Brewarrina, or Bree, in far western NSW. In the 1930s, when Connie was just a girl, welfare officers removed her from her family on Angledool Station in the far north of NSW, and brought her to the Brewarrina mission. Tony Hunter in Plumpton Park, Plumpton. Two of Connie’s sisters had lost all their children to the welfare officers. Whenever the welfare cars came into view, the Hunter children would jump into the river and swim to the other side. Hunter took to Sydney life. He worked as a welfare office for an Aboriginal organisation, then as a foreman for a meat company in Chullora. But in the 1970s, marijuana and amphetamine use were adding to alcohol problems in Mount Druitt, Hunter says. “They caused a lot of division among the Aboriginal people, a lot of thieving. A lot of people were burying their children. The grieving was horrific. And there weren’t any programs for Aboriginal people to help them, counsel them.” Calmly, he lists the casualties in his family. “My old [step] dad, he went first, he died in 77. Then my sister in 84; she was hit by a truck while on the drink. He didn’t stop, and they never found him. Then a young brother died in his sleep with an enlarged heart, alcohol related. Then another brother, then another, all from the alcohol and the speed. These three brothers didn’t see 35 years of age.” In 1989, at the age of 54, Connie had a stroke. She died two years later – in part, Hunter believes, of grief. “By this time, after burying them all, I’m hittin’ the drink pretty heavy by now,” he says. “I was trying to sedate pain, but it was everywhere. I didn’t want to live, and I didn’t want to die.” Hunter can name the date when everything changed: 7 January, 1992. He had been caught drink driving. “My probation officer knew a bloke named Les Beckett. One of those tall Queensland Aboriginal fellas. Now Les Beckett, he had lived an hour and a half from Bree over the border. I’d known him since I was 11 or 12. He’d gotten sober about three years before. The probation officer said, ‘Take this paper over to Les, he’s going to take you to AA meetings, and you tick them off on this form’.” Hunter says he had already been drinking that morning when he took a cab to Beckett’s place in St Mary’s, just west of Blacktown. “Les came out of his house and put his arms around me. He cuddled me. And he said, ‘Tony. I knew God would bring you back to me.’ And I said to myself, ‘Oh no, don’t tell me. He must have done Bible studies. He must have turned a Christian.’” Inside his house, Beckett read the form Hunter had brought from the probation officer, then threw it in the bin. “He said, ‘Tony, there’s no ticking boxes here, mate. There’s a meeting on at St Mary’s at half past 12. Come with me. You might be able to get sober.’” They went to the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. People stood up and told their stories of fighting the grog. Hunter hated and scorned every minute of it. But at the end of the meeting, “they’re all coming up shaking my hand, all these whitefellas, saying: ‘Hello Tony, how are you mate?’” The men went back to Les’s place. “We sat around a big table, and they were just constantly talking to me. It was a windy, cloudy sort of day, and I was looking up at the sky thinking about all the people I’ve lost. I was grieving so much, looking at the clouds, and the tears were rolling out of my eyes. These guys didn’t pull any punches with me. They said, ‘Tony, there’s a way out, mate. You don’t have to drink to have a good life.’ I felt the spiritual part of it through these guys. They were living it. And they were interested in my future, my life. I’d never felt this before.” Hunter went to more meetings. He began to see a counsellor who had also been an alcoholic. “It was like I got this new awakening. I just rocketed out of the dead zone, the evil spirit, where I was pinned down by alcohol.” Melinda Bonham in Plumpton Park, Plumpton. Hunter and Bonham were a good fit for creating Marrin Weejali: his storytelling power, her gifts in organisation. They consulted addiction specialists, other rehabilitation centres; both did diplomas in drug and alcohol counselling. The organisation began with meetings in a church, then a cottage provided by the housing commission, before federal funding enabled Hunter and Bonham to open a much larger centre in Blackett. But it took eight years to build. The locals fought hard against having an Aboriginal drug and alcohol centre in their midst. Protestors tried to challenge the move in the state land and environment court. After the centre was opened, an old man would walk past and throw dog faeces over the fence. A woman who lived out the back would fire her hose over the fence and drench a group of men sitting in the backyard doing a 12-step program. Slowly, however, Marrin Weejali put down roots. Bonham says attitudes changed when the federal government asked them to be a drop-in centre for filling out the 2011 census. The goal was to address an undercount of Indigenous people in 2006, but any local was able to fill out the form at the centre. “White people would come in, hesitate – ‘What am I going to walk into?’. Our staff would say, ‘Hello, how are you, would you like a cup of tea?’. That really broke down a lot of barriers. Some of those people still drop in today.” Marrin Weejali’s open door policy has taken it beyond its original mission. Locals use its optometrist, and the centre distributes government vouchers to help low-income people pay their energy bills. Young people can volunteer at Marrin Weejali to pay off fines for misdemeanours such as travelling on a train without a ticket. A counsellor, Lesley Strickland, says Aboriginal people see the centre’s phone service as “like the Black Yellow Pages: have you got number for this doctor? Where can I get my cat desexed?” “Marrin Weejali has never been broken into,” Hunter says. “It tells me that the community has taken ownership of this centre.” He laughs: “Marrin is a sacred protected site.” The original Marrin Weejali centre. Bonham says she still sees racism towards young Aboriginal people by some local police. “Strip searching, out in the open, pull them over for no reason, harassment. It’s disgusting.” On the other hand, police use Marrin Weejali’s rooms for meetings, as do corrections officers and other public servants. The centre employs a Vietnamese psychologist and works with a Chinese doctor. “I think there’s still racism in this community but there is quite a bit of learning and blending,” Bonham says. Most important is the long connection Hunter and Bonham have to the Mount Druitt community. People think, “If Tony can beat his addiction, I can too,” Hunter says. The six Aboriginal counsellors at Marrin Weejali are all from Mount Druitt and “all defeated the drug ice”. Bonham says Aboriginal people make good counsellors. “With the sorrow and trauma you understand other people’s journey better. Non-Aboriginal people feel that walking in the door.” One of these counsellors is Brett Moran. In 2009 he was 26 and facing a long jail term. He had been getting high on marijuana and amphetamines – and in and out of custody – since he was 12 years old. When he was charged again, an Aboriginal Legal Service court support officer in Penrith got him referred to Marrin Weejali. “The moment I walked through those gates I felt welcome, I felt comfortable, I didn’t feel judged,” he says. Kicking his addiction was not immediate; it required time in a rehab residential centre, and many hours of sitting in a group with other men, talking about the struggles that had brought them to Marrin Weejali. But on 10 May 2010 – Moran knows the date by heart – he stopped using drugs and has been clean ever since. He now runs the same groups at Marrin Weejali he once joined as a client. “At the end of every day I lie on my pillow and feel grateful for the day I’ve just had,” Moran says. For that he thanks his wife, Kristy, his three young daughters, and Marrin Weejali. “Marrin is a sacred place for me. Thanks to Uncle Tony, Mel, everyone here, I have my family, my freedom, my life.” The steady federal funding Marrin Weejali receives – $2.4m a year at present – is both a measure of its effectiveness, and of the need. “The demand for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander substance misuse … services is appalling,” states a Marrin Weejali annual report. That demand has only grown over the past 10 years with the ravages of the state’s methamphetamines epidemic. Bonham and Hunter are seeking funding to open residential services for men and women who need a home while they try to recover from addiction. Hunter also wants to develop programs that take Aboriginal people back to the bush, “and have people meet them, and walk with them, and say, ‘This is where your family comes from – this is why they left’. To create that opportunity for reflection, to lift their spirit. Some of the stories are sadder than mine. They bring tears to my eyes.” There are heartening stories, too. Hunter tells of a girl from far north Queensland who was using ice. She tapped “Aboriginal” and “drug and alcohol” into Google, and found Marrin Weejali. Staff found her sitting in the foyer with a suitcase and a three-year old child. “She’s living in a nice unit now, she’s working, four or five years sober. She still comes to the NA meetings here on a Friday.” Brian Hunter has worked at the Marrin Weejali Aboriginal Corporation for two and a half years. The Aboriginal journey from the bush brought gains as well as losses. It led to the development of urban Indigenous organisations, what Morgan calls a “pan-Aboriginal culture and politics”. The work of the late Maria Lane, an Indigenous academic from South Australia, has shown how the postwar migration from the missions has been critical to the surge of Indigenous university students to 20,000 today, twice as many as 10 years before. Some of these students come from Blacktown. But the journey was not kind to Connie Hunter. “I think she regretted leaving her homeland,” her son says. “Down here, there were nice big hotels where she and her friends went to have lunch. I think she joined the Rooty Hill RSL Club, the hospitality she really enjoyed. But it was a different world.” It has become her son’s world. “I’ve been here for 50 years and survived,” Hunter says. Although he and Bonham have moved to “a lovely home” in Windsor, on Saturday mornings, he skips the local shops and drives for half an hour to have coffee at a Greek café in Mount Druitt. “Once you learn to sleep with one eye open, Mount Druitt is a great place. There’s a lot of people that have come here from the fringes of town, from the world of decency. Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people. The Tongan community – I talk to some of their elders. You look in their eyes when you talk to them – they’re beautiful people. People of understanding. Want to work together, live together.” Hunter sees us out through the Marrin Weejali courtyard, where two men are making coffee. “This is where people have a cigarette together, where a lot of yarns happen. “Healing can begin with a handshake,” he says. “It knocks down the barrier, reflects straight back into here.” He points at his chest: “The spirit is right here, between our rib cage. Let’s shine a little bit of light and hope in here.” This article is based on a narrative paper on Blacktown written for the Scanlon Foundation Research Institute.",News/Australia news,‘Healing can begin with a handshake’: inside Sydney’s only Aboriginal-run drug and alcohol counselling centre,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/14/healing-can-begin-with-a-handshake-inside-sydneys-only-aboriginal-run-drug-and-alcohol-counselling-centre
12/14/2021,"The late writer Nora Ephron (whom I have quoted in this series before and will quote again) famously declared, “I hate my purse” in an essay of the same title. She described being bad at purses, how hers would accumulate loose Tic-Tacs, lipsticks without tops and Kleenex that either had or had not been used. She said, for a period, she gave up on purses and wore an overcoat with large pockets to avoid having to carry one and went out at night with only a lipstick, a $20 bill and a credit card tucked into her bra. This week, we compiled some expert advice on how to take care of your handbag so you can avoid ending up with one as chaotic as Ephron’s.  According to Jenny Velakoulis, the owner of Evans Leather Repair in Melbourne’s Royal Arcade, the first thing you have to do is protect your bag by spraying it with a waterproofing spray, the inside and outside. Then after waiting for 24 hours, condition the leather with a nourishing cream like this mink oil. The creative director of Oroton, Sophie Holt, is also a “big believer in spraying your handbag with a protectant, to give the leather or canvas a protective layer against the elements”. She says a protectant “will also help prevent stains or scratches”. Velakoulis says she often sees bags that have been water damaged because “people put a water bottle back in their bag without sealing it properly and the water has leaked through the bag, leaving marks and changing the character of the leather”. She says it can be even more of a disaster if perfume, oil or something with alcohol in it (like hand sanitiser) leaks. These substances can discolour the leather so it’s important to act quickly and clean your bag thoroughly. If the spill was extensive, she suggests taking your bag to a professional straight away. If you feel confident you can handle the spill yourself, Holt recommends using a quality leather conditioner to clean the bag. She suggests doing this on a regular basis anyhow “to give your handbag a protective layer, remove stains, nourish the leather and add gloss”. Another thing that will increase the longevity of your handbag is proper storage. Holt says: “Store your bag in a dust bag … somewhere away from direct sunlight and humidity to prevent any discolouration.” Proper storage will help your bag keep its structure. “They usually give you tissue paper that’s stuffed inside when you buy it,” Velakoulis says. “Put this back in when you store it, it will help the bag to keep its shape.” She says it’s also important the bags have enough space and aren’t squashed up against other things. When you’re shopping for a bag there are a few things to look out for. Holt says: “I look for bags made from gorgeous soft buttery leathers that are designed with care and consideration … I always make sure the bag sits comfortably on my shoulder without sliding off or crossbody without feeling too bulky or heavy.” For Velakoulis, a bag with good structure and lots of compartments is a sign of a bag that will last a long time. “Look out for something that’s structured and can take that weight,” she says. “The use is really important. Make sure the bag has compartments to separate your things.” If you’re looking at vintage bags, she advises paying attention to how much the leather has dried with age. If dry leather gets caught in the rain, it will crack and deteriorate, so it’s even more important to nourish vintage bags. Although it’s often tempting to load up your bag with everything you might need for the day, Velakoulis warns to be careful because doing so “causes stresses on handles, and when the leather starts stretching, pretty soon it will break”. She says to be particularly aware of this happening with larger bags. “The bigger the bag, the worse it is, because we think this is a great bag for work, I can put whatever I want in it, like my computer.” Your bag will appreciate it if you are selective with what you carry.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Nourish it, store it and don’t carry your whole life: how to care for your handbag",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/14/nourish-it-store-it-and-dont-carry-your-whole-life-how-to-care-for-your-handbag
12/14/2021,"What a difference a week can make. Ten days ago Newcastle lost their season opener 3-1 to Sydney FC, a Cortnee Vine-led contest which served as both a reminder of the Sky Blues’ talent and the Jets’ inconsistencies. Four days later the club signed Emily van Egmond, and two days after that did a 5-1 number on Wellington. “It would have been great to have had her last week,” coach Ash Wilson said after Friday’s rout. “You can’t deny the influence she had just with her calmness on the ball and her ability to find things.”  Van Egmond’s short-term contract with the Jets is one which suits both player and club. The 28-year-old’s return to her hometown side ensures regular game time before she joins the Matildas at the Asian Cup in India in January. For the team, it could yet mean, at the very least, an improved season at most a return to the finals for the first time since 2017-18 – incidentally the last time van Egmond represented the Hunter region. The lack of Australian internationals left in A-League Women naturally render the performances of those who do remain more striking. But it was clear on Friday just how influential a single player can be. Van Egmond, returning from stints with West Ham in the Women’s Super League and Orlando Pride in the NWSL, was deployed more creatively by Wilson than she is for the national team. Her presence brought out Newcastle’s breadth of scorers as Kirsty Fenton, Norwegian Marie Dølvik Markussen and Sophie Harding all celebrated maiden league goals and club stalwart Tara Andrews added a brace. “That’s one of the big reasons we signed her,” Wilson said. “She’s here and she’s wanting to play and she’s a local girl, but she gives so much in terms of her experience and her quality. She worked really hard in attack to try and make forward runs, and defensively she was solid, and I think that had a really big impact on what other players were doing around her too. “Other players were stepping up, the midfield worked really hard, the wingers were looking to get in behind as much as possible knowing they had people on the ball who could find them. That’s definitely what she was able to bring, and what you could see in terms of our performance.” Newcastle, perhaps out of necessity given their stretched financial position, have drawn heavily from their youth ranks and emphasised junior development. The fruits of that approach are apparent through Fenton, who has been in the club set-up since under-13s started playing for the Jets at an under-13 level. The presence of an import for the first time since 2018-19, in Norwegian international Dølvik Markussen, has helped too. The long-term effect of this combination is yet to be seen but the signs are encouraging, and this Friday’s fixture against the ailing Western Sydney could provide a platform of further confidence ahead of tougher tests further down the road. Wilson has been careful to manage expectations, to keep her players optimistic but also in the present. Past seasons have proved little can be gained from doing otherwise, and it has been some time since the Jets have put together a full season. The 2020-21 campaign ended in eighth place from the nine-team competition with two wins from 12 rounds. This year’s introduction of the Phoenix and expansion to 14 regular-season rounds means teams have a little more room for early season error. However, with defending champions Melbourne Victory and runners-up Sydney already top with a perfect two from two, the fourth-placed Jets will slide quickly unless results keep coming. “The performance shows the potential that we have,” Wilson said. “I think we need to be more consistent, we need to have more performances like that before we can start to jump the gun, but if we can put together performances like that. “If we can be clinical, we’ll definitely be very competitive, and if we do make those finals we’ll hopefully be a handful. But it’s very early, there are a lot of good teams, and we need to make sure we’re putting those performances together week in, week out – that’s been a challenge for us in the past.”",Sport/Football,Emily van Egmond’s brief Newcastle Jets return suits both player and club | Emma Kemp,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/14/a-league-women-emily-van-egmonds-brief-newcastle-jets-return-suits-both-player-and-club
12/14/2021,"The election next year will be redolent with spin and obfuscation. Unfortunately, this will be most evident in relation to climate change policy. So let us prepare by outlining the reality of where we are at, and what the future holds. First the good news: 2021 is on target to be the coolest year since 2014. The latest Nasa figures to October has 2021 on track to be around 1.1C above the late 19th century average.  The bad news is this “cool” year is still warmer than any year on record before 2015, and it marks the seventh consecutive year of the planet being more than 1C warmer than the late 19th century average. The worse news is the year is so “cool” because the first half was in La Niña and had abnormally cool temperatures; but the second half of the year has been almost as warm as 2019 and 2020: If the graph does not display please click here So no, climate change has not stopped, and political parties still need a climate change policy. This brings us to the spin and obfuscation. The government, which is facing challenges from independents over a lack of action on emissions, is trying very hard to make it sound like it has actually done something. Their big boast – such as that by Tim Wilson – is that they are “so proud emissions are down by 20% off 2005 levels. Other countries talk big, we deliver! Now we need other countries to follow our leadership!” Firstly, leadership? Excuse me while I stop my eyes rolling so hard they dislodge from their sockets. At the recent Glasgow conference, the Morrison government was mainly leading in inaction and was named the “climate fossil” of the conference by the Climate Action Network. But secondly, the only reason Australia’s emissions are down from 2005 levels at all is due to two things – the end of massive land-clearing in Queensland, and the pandemic: If the graph does not display please click here The cut in emissions from land use is purely because in 2005 there was massive land-clearing in Queensland, and now there is not. Including land use makes Australia’s emissions reductions look good, which is why Australia has always fought to be able to count it: If the graph does not display please click here The pandemic also caused a massive drop in emissions – mostly through reduced transport. Prior to the pandemic, Australia’s emissions excluding land use were still above 2005 levels, and even now, they are a mere 2.9% below 2005: If the graph does not display please click here But this talk about the past is designed to make us not worry about the future, and what needs to be done. The government currently projects emissions (including land use) by 2030 to be 30% below 2005 levels. While the government’s 24%-26% target has not changed, I am content to use this projection as its current path. The problem, as I have noted in the past, is that the big issue with climate change policy is not 2030 targets or net zero, but how much we emit before getting to net zero. We can only emit a certain amount before temperature rises above 1.5C or 2C are inevitable. The Climate Targets Panel estimated earlier this year that Australia’s share of the global 1.5C carbon budget was 7,760m tonnes of CO2 from 2013-2050 and 10,400m tonnes of CO2 to stay under 2C. That means from 2020 onwards we can only emit 6,113Mt CO2 to keep within or 2C budget and 3,473m tonnes to stay within the 1.5C budget. The government’s path will use up our 1.5C carbon budget by 2028, and the 2C budget by 2034. The ALP’s plan to cut emissions by 43% below 2005 levels will also breach the 1.5C budget in 2028, and it breaches the 2C budget (assuming a path to net zero by 2050) by 2037: If the graph does not display please click here Given limiting temperatures to a 1.5C rise appears gone, the focus needs to be on the 2C budget. Under the government’s path, to stay within the 2C budget we would need to get to net zero by 2037 not 2050: If the graph does not display please click here Similarly, the ALP’s policy of a 43% cut by 2030 means we would need to get to net zero by 2041. In this coming election there will be a lot of spin about what has been done and what needs to be done to limit temperature rises. Upon hearing the 20% cut claim, journalists should note that it is due to land-clearing changes which had nothing to do with the federal government, and drops in emissions during the pandemic, which are now being reversed. And all focus should be on the carbon budget – journalists should be asking all parties what they are doing to keep cumulative emissions below the levels needed to limit warming to 2C, and what that means for cuts after 2030. Everything else is just spin.",News/Business,Don’t believe the Coalition’s ‘emissions are down’ spin.

12/14/2021,"Jam Land, the company part-owned by the energy minister Angus Taylor and his brother Richard, illegally poisoned critically endangered grasslands and should restore native habitat, a ministerial review of the original investigation has concluded. The decision, published late Friday, follows an 18-month review of the original determination which ordered Jam Land to restore 103 hectares of grasslands on a property in the New South Wales Monaro region.  It comes more than five years after the company poisoned the grasslands, known as the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands, on a property in Corrowong. Richard Taylor, one of Jam Land’s directors, said the company was considering whether it would appeal the decision in the federal court and accused the department of agriculture, water and environment of sitting on the outcome for the past nine months. “We’re obviously very disappointed but also annoyed that the department, having sat on this for nine months, have delivered it to us two weeks before Christmas and we’ve only got 28 days to lodge an appeal with the federal court,” he said. “We would like to do that but we’ve just got to make sure we can resource it. “For us, it’s a matter of principle.” In May last year, Jam Land sought a ministerial review of the federal environment department’s determination that the company illegally cleared about 30 hectares of the grasslands in late October 2016. The original determination ordered the company to undertake restoration work – including weed management, erecting stock-proof fences and avoiding broad-acre application of herbicides or fertilisers – on a separate area of the property to the cleared land. Angus Taylor is a shareholder in Jam Land, via his family company Gufee. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Jam Land investigation has been controversial because Angus Taylor sought meetings with senior environment officials about the grasslands while it was under way. The office of the then environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, subsequently sought advice about whether laws protecting the grasslands could be changed. A delegate to the environment minister, Sussan Ley, upheld the original decision in the case on Friday. The statement said the initial investigation found the poison had a significant impact on the critically endangered grasslands. Clearing without first seeking approval carries a maximum penalty of $11m for a body corporate. “In responding to the contravention of the Act, a delegate to the minister made a remediation determination, requiring Jam Land as the landholder to mitigate the damage by managing and enhancing the natural ecological values of 103 hectares of native grasslands on the property,” the statement says. It is the first time in the history of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act that a ministerial review of a remediation order has been sought. Richard Taylor said the company believed it had undertaken a best practice environmental assessment when it commissioned an ecologist to assess the property before the clearing in 2016. That assessment was done in accordance with the relevant state legislation, he said, and the broader community had been unaware the grasslands were also listed under federal laws.

In a briefing released to Guardian Australian under freedom of information laws in 2019, department officials wrote there had been public consultation at the time of the original listing in the 2000s and again when it was upgraded to critically endangered in 2016. The latter had exceeded the statutory requirements of the Act and included emails to councils, local land services and the National Farmers’ Federation and NSW Farmers Association. Taylor said as a result of the assessment of the property, Jam Land had fenced off a larger, separate area that was identified as having high conservation value and managed it for conservation “at our own expense and we’ve had no credit for that”. He said about 30 to 40% of his land holdings in the Monaro region were being managed for conservation and this was also typical of other farmers. “The way the department is behaving, that goodwill has just vaporised not only for us but throughout the district,” Taylor said. He said he was unhappy with the way the department had handled the investigation with multiple delays since it was referred to them five years ago. “They’ve strung this out I believe for political purposes. It’s been very politically charged,” he said. A department spokesperson said the matter was complex in nature and “the department considered the issues raised by Jam Land to enable the delegate to determine whether to affirm, vary or set aside the determination to ensure natural justice was provided.” The spokesperson said the department sought Jam Land’s engagement throughout the process and the decision to affirm the remediation order was made in accordance with compliance policy. A Guardian Australia investigation in 2019 revealed Angus Taylor met with senior environment officials and the office of the former environment minister Josh Frydenberg in March 2017 about the listing of the grasslands while the investigation was under way. Frydenberg’s office sought advice from his department about whether protection for the grasslands could be weakened in secret. Departmental emails also showed Frydenberg sought urgent information about the investigation after it was raised in parliament by an unnamed person. Angus Taylor has repeatedly stated that he sought the meeting with departmental officials on behalf of constituents in Hume who were concerned about the grasslands listing. He has previously said “I did not make any representations to federal or state authorities in relation to any compliance action being undertaken.” A spokesperson for the department of environment and energy said officials “did not discuss the compliance matter with Taylor”. Both Taylor and Frydenberg have said the meeting was focused on the “technical aspects” of the grasslands listing. Comment was sought from Angus Taylor.",News/Environment,"Company part-owned by Angus Taylor illegally poisoned grasslands, ministerial review finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/14/company-part-owned-by-angus-taylor-illegally-poisoned-grasslands-ministerial-review-finds
12/14/2021,"Australia’s eight planned nuclear submarines will cost $70bn at an “absolute minimum” and it’s “highly likely” to be more than that, defence analysts say. With inflation, the cost could be as high as $171bn, according to a new report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.   Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The thinktank’s report contained a series of estimates ranging from low to high and conceded that estimating the final cost of the project is necessarily an “extremely assumption-rich activity”. Under the low range, for a smaller submarine with a more efficient build, the “constant” cost (not including inflation) would be about $70bn. Including inflation (the “out-turned” cost), it would be $116bn. Under the high-range scenario, the constant cost would be $79bn and with inflation it could cost up to $171bn if the schedule stretches out, further compounding the effect of inflation. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said the planned nuclear-powered submarines, part of the Aukus deal with the United States and the United Kingdom, would likely cost more than the scrapped plan for conventional submarines, which would have cost $90bn. The Aspi report co-author Dr Marcus Hellyer said there was some confusion about the cost of the deal signed with France’s Naval Group. After initially announcing it would cost $50bn, defence officials said that was the out-turned cost, but eventually it was revealed that was the cost before inflation. Australia will partner with either the US or the UK to buy their boat designs, and a nuclear-powered submarine taskforce is working through the details. “We haven’t determined the specific vessel that we will be building, but that will be done through the rather significant and comprehensive program assessment that will be done with our partners over the next 12 to 18 months,” Morrison said in September. “Now, that will also inform the costs that relate to this, and they are yet to be determined.” The authors of the Aspi report, Implementing Australia’s Nuclear Submarine Program, wrote that while the Aukus deal has seemed to move fast, the enterprise would still be “a massive undertaking and probably the largest and most complex endeavour Australia has embarked upon”. “The challenges, costs and risks will be enormous. It’s likely to be at least two decades and tens of billions of dollars in sunk costs before Australia has a useful nuclear-powered military capability. “At an absolute minimum, an eight-boat [nuclear-powered] program will cost around $70bn … However, it’s highly likely that it will cost substantially more once the cost drivers are more clearly understood. To channel [former US defence secretary] Donald Rumsfeld, there are things we know we don’t know, and things we don’t know we don’t know; both will drive up the estimate.” The French were furious at the decision to end the contract for 12 Barracuda-class submarines in favour of the Aukus deal. The federal government said the decision was made because of the superior technology that the US and the UK would now share with Australia. Hellyer told Guardian Australia the government needed to work out its priorities and would need to balance capability needs, scheduling and the Australian industry content. He emphasised that picking which submarine to build was “secondary” to picking a strategic partner. The US is building submarines at a rate 10 times higher than the UK, he said. “Who has the capacity to ramp up to help us? If we want one every three years, the UK would have to double their production. The issue is which partner has the capacity to help us get there.” The report outlines a range of options for how the build could progress. The government has said boats will be built at Adelaide’s Osborne shipyard, but Hellyer said there is some wriggle room to start the build overseas while training Australian workers before transitioning the work here. Another option is a collaborative build, like the “Joint Strike Fighter on steroids”, he said, referring to the air combat program. Australian industry is part of the JSF supply chain, but the final assembly happens in the US. “That could make a huge difference to the schedule. It could aim for the early 2030s instead of the late 2030s or even early 40s,” Hellyer said. The report canvasses other issues that will need to be resolved. There are likely to be legislative changes needed to allow nuclear reactors in Australia. The government should consider appointing an internal nuclear regulator, an inspector general of nuclear safety, and how it will responsibly dispose of radioactive waste once the reactors that power the submarines reach the end of their useful lives. The report also warns of a capability gap as the existing six Collins-class submarines might have to retire before the new submarines are in the water. “We may have already reached the point at which it’s impossible to avoid a serious and potentially enduring decrease in submarine capability,” the authors wrote.",News/World news,Australia’s Aukus nuclear submarines estimated to cost at least $70bn,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/14/australias-aukus-nuclear-submarines-estimated-to-cost-at-least-70bn
12/14/2021,"Domestic border restrictions in Australia have eased as local cases of the Omicron variant rise. Overseas, the UK has raised its Covid alert level and reintroduced restrictions amid concerns that Omicron poses a “rapidly increasing risk to the public and healthcare services”. Here’s what we know so far about Omicron and how worried Australia should be about the new variant of concern.  Omicron was first identified on 24 November in South Africa. Two days later, the World Health Organization declared Omicron a “variant of concern” – the fifth such designation – reflecting a high number of mutations that could increase virus transmissibility and reduce the effectiveness of vaccines. Genomic testing of the Covid-19 variant in South Africa showed Omicron contains an unusually high number of mutations compared with the original strain, including 32 on the spike protein, which most vaccines target to prime the immune system against the virus. According to the World Health Organization, the variant has been detected in 63 countries on six continents as of 9 December. WHO said on Sunday that based on current evidence, Omicron appeared to be spreading faster than the Delta variant, both in South Africa, where the circulation of Delta is low, and in countries like the UK where Delta incidence is high. “Given the current available data, it is likely that Omicron will outpace the Delta variant where community transmission occurs,” it said. In the UK, cases of the Omicron variant appear to be doubling every two to three days, and some scientists predict it will become the dominant variant there by the end of the year. As of Monday, New South Wales had reported a total of 64 cases of the Omicron variant. A number of Covid cases linked to a Newcastle nightclub outbreak, which has resulted in 84 positive tests to date, are also likely to be the Omicron variant, NSW Health said on Monday. Cases of Omicron have also been confirmed in returning international travellers in Victoria, Queensland, and the Northern Territory. To date, one person in Australia has been admitted to hospital with the Omicron variant. “It’s too early to say whether or not Omicron causes a more mild form of illness compared to Delta,” said Dr Benjamin Veness at an Ozsage briefing on Monday. Prof Nancy Baxter, head of the University of Melbourne’s school of population and global health, said that in previous waves of Covid-19 there had been a large gap between the peak in infections and hospitalisations. “Given we have only now started to see large numbers of Omicron cases … it will be some time before we actually know how many hospitalisations result from that,” she said. “This is a story that’s playing out.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Overseas, hospitalisation data from South Africa between 14 November and 4 December showed ICU occupancy was 6.3% – a much lower rate than when Delta cases peaked there in July, according to WHO. The agency said hospitalisation data was limited, and “more time will be needed to understand the impact of Omicron on severity and death, particularly in the context of vaccination”. Even if only a very small proportion of Omicron cases require treatment in hospital, the potential for rapid spread was concerning, Veness said. “There’s a whole bunch of states now that are just opening up their borders and about to see a significantly greater number of Covid cases than they had previously,” he said. “Because the Australian healthcare system is already struggling with current levels of demand, and has a backlog – particularly things like elective surgery … we really don’t have much space for additional hospitalisations.” Baxter said that the Omicron variant “does lead to [an] increase in breakthrough infections”. “A number of outbreaks in multiple countries have been in fully vaccinated and even boosted individuals,” she said. “These seem to be affecting large numbers of people in single settings … ie super-spreading events.” A small South African study – which is not yet peer reviewed – has found a 41-fold reduction in neutralising antibodies triggered by the Pfizer vaccine against Omicron compared with the original strain of Covid-19. The vaccine’s overall effectiveness, however, also depends on other elements of the immune response, such as T cells. The study also found the Omicron variant of the virus was infecting cells by binding to a receptor called ACE2 – the same method other variants use to enter cells. “This was better than I expected of Omicron,” said the study’s corresponding author, Prof Alex Sigal, in a tweet, meaning the variant is “a tractable problem” that can be targeted with existing vaccines. Preliminary results released by Pfizer last week suggest administering a third dose of its vaccine increases protection against Omicron 25-fold compared with taking two doses. The firm said three doses of its Covid vaccine resulted in a similar level of neutralising antibodies for Omicron as two doses did for the original strain of Covid-19. In a bid to improve protection against Omicron, the gap between Covid booster vaccinations has been shortened in Australia from six to five months. “The anticipated benefits of bringing forward the booster dose include earlier protection, particularly against severe disease in those at risk, and improved protection against Covid-19 due to the Omicron variant,” the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation said in a statement on Sunday.",News/Australia news,Omicron variant: what do we know about the new Covid strain and why are scientists so concerned?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/14/omicron-variant-what-do-we-know-about-the-new-covid-strain-and-why-are-scientists-so-concerned
12/14/2021,"Religious Australians will be given greater freedom of speech than non-religious expressions of conscience under the Coalition’s bill, a leading academic has warned. Prof George Williams raised the issue in a submission to the human rights committee inquiry into the religious discrimination package.  The bill faces an uncertain future with two inquiries running over summer and some religious organisations threatening to withdraw their support over the Morrison government’s deal with four Liberal moderates to strengthen protections for gay students at religious schools at the same time. Williams submitted the bill should “not be enacted in its current form”, in part because those protections have not yet been included in the bill. Williams argued the bill was “inconsistent” with international human rights law which “does not separate out religious speech for protection”, while the Australian Lawyers Alliance has warned it could be unconstitutional because it curtails other rights. The bill states that “statements of belief” do not breach discrimination laws, including a statement of a religious belief or “a belief that the person genuinely considers to relate to the fact of not holding a religious belief”. Williams argued that this “only protects statements connected to religious belief” not “other beliefs, such as matters of conscience”, giving religious statements an “elevated status”. “The consequence of this is that a person may make a statement, perhaps about another group or expressing a belief such as pacifism, but the statement will only receive protection if it has a religious basis,” he said. “A person making exactly the same statement as a matter of conscience without a religious basis will receive no protection.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Williams said prioritising religious speech was “deeply problematic in a secular nation” and has “no basis” in the international law the bill purports to implement. Williams called for a “comprehensive law” to protect freedom of speech and religion and, failing that, prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of religion in the same way other attributes are protected. The ALA submitted that there was “significant doubt” about the constitutionality of key sections of the bill. Although freedom of religion, thought and conscience is protected in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the ALA submitted there is “no hierarchy of human rights” allowing religion to override other rights. The ALA submitted the “external affairs power” could not be used to give constitutional power for sections of the bill, because it interferes with other rights protected by the ICCPR. The ALA warned the bill overrides state discrimination laws, meaning those who make “statements of belief” are “immune from legal consequences under those laws”. “[The bill] is effectively legislating bigotry, by enabling religious statements of belief to be used as a cloak for sexism, racism, homophobia and other prejudices,” it said. The ALA also noted the clause allowing religious educational institutions to preference people in employment due to their religious belief would also override state laws, potentially allowing indirect discrimination against teachers because of their sexuality or gender identity. “The only circumstances in which a religious school should be able to discriminate in employment decisions is when a particular religious belief is an inherent requirement of the role,” it said. Earlier in December the Victorian government passed laws limiting schools’ ability to discriminate to instances where “religious belief is an inherent requirement of the job”. The Victorian attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, has accused the Morrison government of seeking to “entrench discrimination in federal laws”. Symes has said she is “disappointed” by the federal bill and would “very firmly oppose” any attempt to override Victoria’s anti-discrimination laws, including through a possible high court challenge. Labor has yet to decide its final position on the religious discrimination bill, but it has said it will be guided by principles including that prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of religion should not remove protections against discrimination on other attributes.",News/Australia news,"Voices of religious Australians prioritised in ‘deeply problematic’ discrimination bill, experts warn",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/14/voices-of-religious-australians-prioritised-in-deeply-problematic-discrimination-bill-experts-warn
12/14/2021,"Female candidates are overrepresented for marginal seats at the next federal election, while safe seats for both major parties remain dominated by males, an analysis by Guardian Australia shows. While the major parties are yet to finalise all candidates for the forthcoming federal election, an analysis of those preselected so far for parliament’s 35 marginal seats shows that about 60% of the candidates across both major parties are female.  But amid the ongoing push to increase the number of women in parliament, the federal election will also see at least six incumbent female MPs being challenged by male candidates in marginal seats. This includes Coalition candidates challenging sitting Labor MPs in Lilley, Cowan and most likely Gilmore, while Labor men are challenging sitting Liberal women in Bass, Robertson and Lindsay. Labor, which has preselected 34 of the 35 lower house seats with margins of 5% or below, has a total of 22 women running and 12 men – including incumbents. The Coalition, which is yet to finalise preselections in New South Wales and in some Queensland and Victorian seats, has preselected 15 women and 10 men. Excluding incumbent MPs, Labor has preselected 10 new female and seven male candidates, while the Coalition has preselected nine and five respectively. But while women outnumber men for marginal seat contests, the analysis shows that when safer seats have come up for grabs, men have been more likely to secure preselection. For the Coalition, male candidates have prevailed in the Queensland seats of Bowman, Flynn and Dawson – all held on margins of more than 8% – which have been left vacant by the departure of Liberal Andrew Laming, and Nationals Ken O’Dowd and George Christensen. Henry Pike, the new candidate for the seat of Bowman, was successful over four female candidates and was the sole man who nominated for the seat. In Victoria, the Liberal party has chosen Keith Wolohan to run for the safe Victorian seat of Menzies, which is held on a 7% margin and is being vacated by long-serving MP Kevin Andrews. The Coalition is yet to decide who will take over the seats of Flinders and Nicholls in Victoria, and Hughes and Bennelong in NSW, all of which are being vacated by male MPs. The NSW Liberal party has endorsed a target of 50% female candidates for the federal election, but despite the prime minister, Scott Morrison, saying he is “determined” to boost the number of women in his ranks, factional negotiations are still under way. While Labor has boosted the number of women preselected in marginal seats, it has preselected men for the safe seats of Spence in South Australia and the newly created seat of Hawke in Victoria. In both seats, which boast margins of more than 10%, women had sought preselection. In Spence, Alice Dawkins, the daughter of Keating minister John Dawkins, accused the party of undermining its own rules for female quotas in winnable seats, while in Hawke, former Labor state secretary Sam Rae was chosen despite a push from Labor women in the state for the prized seat to go to a woman. The attempt by both major parties to increase the number of women in parliament comes after sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, undertook a review into the culture of Parliament House that found gender inequality was a key driver of bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault within commonwealth parliamentary workplaces. Jenkins recommended that to address the problem, both major parties should adopt new targets to achieve gender balance among parliamentarians “as part of a 10-year strategy designed to advance gender equality, diversity and inclusion”. In the current parliament, there are 104 male MPs and 47 female MPs – representing just 31% of the House of Representatives. According to a parliamentary library paper published in November, just 24 of the Liberal party’s 90 federal MPs and senators are women, representing 26.7%. For Labor, 46 of its 94 federal parliamentarians are women, accounting for 48.9%. Just six out of 21 National party parliamentarians are female, as are six of the Greens 10 parliamentarians.",News/Australia news,"Women overrepresented in marginal contests, while more men preselected in safe seats for federal election",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/14/women-overrepresented-in-marginal-contests-while-more-men-preselected-in-safe-seats-for-federal-election
12/14/2021,"There’s a scene in Netflix’s series Maid when protagonist Alex (Margaret Qualley) enters the family court to fight her abusive ex-partner Sean (Nick Robinson) for custody of their three-year-old daughter. The camera switches between quick shots of the proceedings to lingering closeups of Alex’s face, her eyes wide in fear. She’s dressed awkwardly in clothes borrowed from another woman staying at the domestic violence shelter; her eyelashes are thick and dark. The perspective switches and we see through her eyes, as the words stop making sense to her: for many victims of domestic abuse, family court is their first experience of the legal system and they are blindsided by languages and processes they have no way of navigating.  “Your honour Ms Russell has failed to legal, legal, legal,” she hears Sean’s lawyer say, “and she’s legally legal, we ask the court to legal, legal, legal.” Alex, who didn’t have a lawyer, loses custody for a week. She stares blankly as her violent ex-partner carries their daughter through the security gates in a wonderfully underplayed moment of tragedy that contrasts with the satire. Back at the shelter, she lies rigid on the carpet beneath the “creepy” gaze of a herd of plastic toy ponies. It’s an exquisite merging of the two emotional tones that define the show: comedic and infuriatingly sad. Being so distraught you can’t get off the carpet isn’t funny. Domestic abuse and the patriarchal system that supports it isn’t funny. But Maid, a 10-part word-of-mouth hit which came out earlier this year, weaves bleak humour through harsh realities to invite the viewer to look closely at complexities they might otherwise turn away from: in particular, issues facing victims of domestic abuse in a system that doesn’t serve them. After Alex flees Sean, the catastrophes pile on; the series explores intergenerational violence, financial abuse, poverty, alcoholism, PTSD and society’s minimisation of coercive control as an abusive behaviour. When Alex tries to explain the isolation and financial abuse she has suffered, her mother Paula (played by Qualley’s real-life mother Andie Macdowell in an acclaimed performance) dismisses it: “Can I name 450 things men have done to me that are worse than balancing a chequebook? Yes, I can!” But it’s the financial abuse that has made Alex’s life so precarious. After fleeing, she sits at the social services office with her toddler on her lap. “I need a job to prove that I need daycare, in order to get a job? What kind of fuckery is that?” she asks the social worker, who nods like she’s heard it all before. When Alex finds a possible employer, she asks if she can take her daughter. “To a job interview?” the social worker replies with a quizzical look. The catch-22 is funny to me because I know it’s true. Domestic violence is a trap, but leaving it can feel like a trap too; I’ve done it myself. When Sean takes custody, Alex is told she likely won’t get it back if she can’t find a house and a job. She sits on the bus and fills out more inscrutable forms, whose text transforms on screen again to the message she believes she is being sent: Go fuck yourself, cry me a river, nobody cares, you’re gonna lose, you’re gonna lose. Moments of respite – like Sean agreeing to shared parenting – are short-lived as the story circles back again and again to the problems of post-separation abuse and inadequate support systems, the narrative arc mirroring the toxic cycle of an abusive relationship while keeping humour as a thread throughout. The show would be a tough ride without it. The ability to laugh wryly alongside Alex is vital not just for comic relief but to help the viewer see her as a fully rounded human being: strong, funny, flawed. After a patronising court-ordered parenting class where the teacher droningly lists fruits they can feed their children, Alex declares: “If it helps me get Maddy back I’m gonna be the fucking valedictorian of Bad Mom School.” Gallows humour is a way for victims to cope. I know I wouldn’t have survived without it. I made jokes to friends during my own experiences not because I didn’t take it seriously, but because I had to find a way through it. I appreciate the humour in Maid because I recognise it in myself. I hope that others will let the comedy introduce them to the “fuckery” that is domestic abuse and the flawed system that overcomplicates the lives of its survivors because this is something people need to stop turning away from. This is something people need to see.",Arts/Culture,Maid: the bleak humour of Netflix’s hit show rings true to victims – and that’s not all it gets right,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/dec/14/maid-the-bleak-humour-of-netflixs-hit-show-rings-true-to-victims-and-thats-not-all-it-gets-right
12/14/2021,"Fresh doubts have emerged over whether Australia can rely on boosting soil carbon to achieve its net zero emissions goals with a new New South Wales government report predicting the land sector will become a significant source of emissions in a warmer climate. The concerns are raised in a report on soil health trends in NSW forests, published recently without fanfare by the state’s Natural Resources Commission. It examined soil organic carbon (SOC) levels in eastern NSW forests and how they may be affected by projected rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns.  They found major losses could be expected, particularly for southern forests, suggesting “forest managers will have to implement appropriate soil carbon-enhancing strategies even to just maintain current SOC levels”. “This also has implications for identifying ongoing net carbon emissions from NSW lands, with respect to aiming for Net Zero Emissions and mitigating climate change,” it said. In a separate government report detailing the modelling – known as NARCliM – used, scientists found the problem of soils releasing more carbon as conditions became warmer and drier would be statewide and would accelerate with further heating. “From the average of the 12 models, in the upper depth interval (0 to 30cm of soil), there is a statewide average 2.5 tonnes of carbon per hectare decrease to the near-future change period [to 2040] and 5.1tC/ha to the far-future change period,” the second report said. The models ranged from as much as 1.6tC/ha additional carbon taken up on average to losses of as much as 12tC/ha. Scientists have long known the carbon content in soil can vary considerably based on temperatures, moisture content and soil type, among other factors. For instance, rising temperatures tend to boost microbial activity that results in more of the carbon humus in the soil digested, and extra carbon dioxide emitted. As the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering noted in a recent explainer, more carbon is stored in soil than in the atmosphere and all plant life combined so what happens to that carbon can make a big difference. However, measuring carbon isn’t cheap, costing about $30 a hectare a year. Even so, governments including Australia’s commonwealth and some states are increasingly looking to soil to do much of the work to meet their emissions reduction targets. The Morrison government’s recently released 2050 net zero plan, relies on as much as 17m tonnes of CO2 a year be sequestered in soil carbon projects for carbon neutrality to be achieved. “Until we have better scientific evidence, we need to be cautious about relying on soil carbon to be our saviour in our net zero plans,” said Beverley Henry, an adjunct associate professor at Queensland University of Technology. One priority should be making it cheaper to measure what carbon is contained in the soil, how it fluctuates with weather conditions, and how it can be expected to change in the future. Also, a better understanding of how human intervention can make a difference is needed since farmers can expect millions of dollars in payments for trapping more carbon. “We need to get better, less costly soil measuring techniques,” Henry said, adding many more surveys are needed to shore-up results generated in laboratories. “If you have more droughts, it is more difficult to consistently increase soil carbon,” she said. “The increased variability of the climate makes it harder to build soil carbon but more importantly to keep it there.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Australia’s climate is tending to dry out, particularly in the south, CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology have found. Rain-bearing storm tracks are shifting southwards, with more of the moisture missing the continent. The NSW government reports echo findings by scientists such as former CSIRO researcher Jeff Baldock. He identified a decade ago a positive feedback loop may exist if warming temperatures led to more carbon being released, in turn triggering more warming. Baldock said rainfall is typically the “principal dictator” of how much carbon is in the soil. Modelling, such as that cited by the Natural Resources Commission, would particularly be driven by rainfall predictions. In Australia, climate science still has only broad-based projections of future shifts. Farmers had an interest in improving the carbon content of their soils as it typically improves productivity, he said. Planting legumes, for instance, can bolster carbon levels but landholders would have to consider the trade-offs. “Can farming businesses still be viable when the system is trying to put carbon into the ground?” Baldock said. Guardian Australia approached Angus Taylor, the federal emissions reduction minister, and Matt Kean, the NSW treasurer and environment minister, for comment. Chris Bowen, Labor’s federal climate spokesman, said “transparency and accountability are not things generally associated with the Morrison government”. A Labor government would “commission a short and sharp review” of the Australian Carbon Credit Unit framework, including how they applied to farms, he said. His NSW Labor counterpart Jihad Dib said the Natural Resources Commission report underscored the need to “listen to the science” if the land sector is to play an important role in lowering emissions. “The only way to guarantee emissions reduction is to legislate the emissions reduction and have a clear and transparent plan to deliver it,” Dib said. Labor’s net zero emissions bill would create a Net Zero Commission to develop and monitor emissions cuts in NSW. “This bill has passed the upper house, the NSW government should support it in the parliament in the new year,” he said.",News/Australia news,Doubts over Coalition’s net zero target as report finds soil carbon emissions will increase as climate warms ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/14/doubts-over-coalitions-net-zero-target-as-report-finds-soil-carbon-emissions-will-increase-as-climate-warms
12/14/2021,"Australia may be manufacturing mRNA vaccines for Covid-19 and other diseases by 2024 under an in-principle agreement struck with pharmaceutical giant Moderna. Scott Morrison will announce on Tuesday that under the deal a new sovereign vaccine manufacturing facility will be built in Victoria to produce pandemic and non-pandemic respiratory vaccines, including potential flu vaccines.  The long-term “strategic partnership” between the federal government, Victorian government and Moderna will allow 100m mRNA vaccines to be produced in Australia each year in a pandemic, starting in 2024 “pending regulatory and planning approval”. The government did not release any commercial details of the agreement before Tuesday’s announcement. The move to establish a sovereign manufacturing capability comes almost a year after experts urged the Australian government to establish such a facility in Australia to reduce the country’s reliance on overseas producers, and follows sustained criticism of the Coalition’s vaccine procurement strategy that caused initial delays to the rollout. Australia became heavily reliant on overseas produced mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna after the government accepted advice from the Australian technical advisory group on immunisation (Atagi) in April that the Australian-produced AstraZeneca jab should be avoided for those under the age of 50. It did so because of the extremely low risk of a rare blood clotting complication. After the federal government engaged business consultants McKinsey to develop a business case on local mRNA manufacturing last year, the government sought expressions of interest from potential bidders for end-to-end production of mRNA vaccines in May this year. Ahead of Tuesday’s announcement, Morrison said mRNA technology would play an important and growing role in Australia’s preparedness for future pandemics. “This investment will continue to secure Australia’s future economic prosperity while protecting lives by providing access to world-leading mRNA vaccines made on Australian soil,” he said. “The new mRNA manufacturing facility in Victoria will produce respiratory vaccines for potential future pandemics and seasonal health issues such as the common flu, protecting lives and livelihoods.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The health minister, Greg Hunt, said the government was “looking forward to finalising the agreements with Moderna as soon as possible”. “Ensuring Moderna has a manufacturing presence here will deliver Australia priority access to products manufactured here in Australia, by Australians, for Australians, using the most cutting edge vaccination science available in the world today,” he said. The announcement comes after the government cut the time for Covid-19 vaccine booster shots from six months to five in a bid to keep people protected against the virus as the Omicron variant spreads, and approved Moderna as a booster shot. Moderna’s mRNA vaccine was first approved by the Australian government in August for all adults, with a total of 10m doses ordered for 2021, and a further 15m booster doses ordered for the first half of 2022. While details of the agreement with Moderna are not yet clear, the finance minister Simon Birmingham said the US-based company would become a vital part of Australia’s mRNA research and development landscape, “bringing investment and opportunities for the entire research sector”. “This investment will mean world-leading clinical trials, a strong local workforce and creating opportunities through supply chain activities, helping to drive Australia’s economy forward.” This year’s budget allocated an unspecified amount of funding to help create large-scale manufacturing of mRNA vaccines in Australia, with details kept secret because of commercial in-confidence negotiations. The total budget allocation for the distribution and administration of Covid-19 vaccines over the next five years is $1.9bn. In order to promote the development of an mRNA sector in Australia, the Australian government will also invest up to $25m from next year for what it has called an “mRNA Clinical Trials Enabling Infrastructure Grant Opportunity”.This funding will support Australian medical research and medical innovation projects that “leverage and enhance emerging technologies, platforms, equipment and infrastructure to conduct clinical trials of mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics”. Labor, which has long been arguing that Australia needs a sovereign mRNA manufacturing capability, announced in April that it would prioritise such a facility under its proposed National Reconstruction Fund if it formed government. Both the NSW and Victorian governments have also announced plans to progress mRNA vaccine development in their states, with the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, announcing last month the state would commit $96m to a pilot facility.

12/14/2021,"Royal Mail has said it is facing high levels of sickness that mean almost double the number of employees are absent than in 2018, before Covid-19 was identified. The postal service said deliveries were operating as normal across most of the country but that a small number of local offices may not be able to deliver six days a week at present. The Royal Mail online service update identified 21 offices out of 1,200 that were experiencing delays.  A spokesperson said the difficulties related “to local issues such as Covid-related self-isolation, high levels of sick absence, resourcing or other local factors”. They said “targeted support” was being offered to those offices affected in order to restore the service. Postal workers said a revision in working practices introduced in recent weeks had only added to difficulties caused by absences and claimed there were shortages of temporary staff to help with Christmas deliveries. One with close knowledge of Royal Mail’s operations told the BBC, which first reported the staff shortage issues, that the situation at the service was “horrific” owing to sickness and increased demand in the run-up to Christmas. The source claimed: “It’s much worse than a normal Christmas.” One postal worker wrote on the Facebook page of the Communication Workers Union (CWU): “Lots of let down customers and we will be delivering Christmas cards and presents in January again”. Terry Pullinger, the CWU’s deputy general secretary (postal), blamed “failings of systems, data [and] management capability” for some of the problems. In an open letter published by the union, Pullinger wrote: “Trying to maintain a great public service throughout the pandemic has been incredibly difficult for everybody, especially while deploying major changes and considering the great annual challenge of the Christmas period pressure.” He said the union was working with management to “respond locally and at pace, in order to tackle the current challenges”.",News/Business,Royal Mail’s sickness absence rate almost double 2018 level,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/13/royal-mails-sickness-absence-rate-almost-double-2018-level-postal-workers
