3/13/2022,"STORY: As fighting rages in Ukraine, western countries look set to ramp up action against Russia’s economy. The U.S. and EU, together with G7 countries, plan to strip Russia of its “most favored nation” status. That's according to multiple Reuters sources. The EU said last week that it was looking at what it could do within the context of the World Trade Organization. Though it sounds technical, stripping Russia of the status would open the way to stiff new tariffs and quotas on its exports. In 2020, the EU imported over $105 billion of goods from the country. That was mostly oil and gas, but also included large quantities of farm produce, raw materials, chemicals, iron and steel. In the U.S., removing Russia’s “Permanent Normal Trade Relations” status would require an act of Congress. However, officials say lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have already indicated their support for such a move. WTO rules normally require all countries to be treated equally. But it looks like Russia is about to lose that privilege.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Russia to lose 'most favored nation' trade status,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-lose-most-favored-nation-114334395.html
3/13/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin is feeling ""cornered like a rat"" as his Ukrainian invasion lingers into its third week, a former U.S. intelligence officer told Fox News Digital, and his personal history suggests he will continue to lash out in order to regain the upper hand. Rebekah Koffler, a former U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency agent and author of ""Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America"", told Fox News Digital on Saturday that an excerpt from Putin’s 2000 autobiography ""First Person"" detailing growing up in a dilapidated Leningrad apartment can be applied to his record as the Russian leader and his current invasion of Ukraine. NO-FLY ZONE IN UKRAINE WORTH THE RISKS; PUTIN MAY ATTACK WESTERN NATIONS ANYWAY, GOP REP SAYS Putin describes in his book having to traverse several rat infested floors to get to his childhood apartment and that one day he wrote that he grabbed a stick and chased a large rat into a corner. When the rat realized he was trapped, he attacked young Putin forcing him to run away in a moment that apparently impacted the future Russian president. Koffler said that the childhood story about the rat, and other stories Putin has approved to be told about his personal life, are a conscious effort to convey to the West that he will always strike back when trapped. ""He wants people to know that when cornered, he will be fighting,"" Koffler told Fox News. ""He will not be surrendering."" ZELENSKYY ISSUES DEFIANT MESSAGE TO RUSSIA: 'LET THEM COME' In another biography, ""Vladimir Putin: Life History"", Putin is quoted as saying that he learned through neighborhood fights as a child that ""you have to fight to the finish line in every fight"" and ""you need to assume that there is no retreat."" Putin’s predicament began when, according to Koffler, he ""miscalculated"" two major issues related to invading Ukraine by not factoring in the Ukrainian people’s will to fight and the role technology would play in bringing the images of destruction to households across the world. ""He definitely miscalculated and now he feels that he’s trapped because he has to execute this operation and reach his goal."" Koffler explained that Putin watched in horror as the U.S. toppled regimes in Libya and Iraq and fears he might meet the same fate, especially when he hears American leaders claim that he is a deranged madman and call for him to be assassinated by his inner circle. Part of the reason Putin is feeling the pressure regardless of any short term victories he may see on the battlefield is that the Russian leader views this fight with Ukraine as a fight for the survival of his country. Author Zbigniew Brzezinski writes in his book ""The Grand Chessboard"" that ""he who controls Eurasia controls the world"" and Koffler says that Putin very much believes in that notion while also believing that the United States feels the same way. ""They know it's not about who controls Ukraine at all,"" Koffler said. ""It’s about who controls Eurasia and who controls the world. This is why you see Putin fighting for his life, for survivability."" Another factor to consider when discussing the pressure Putin feels, Koffler says, is the current proximity of NATO forces to Russia’s large cities. Koffler explained that during the Cold War, the distance between St. Petersburg and NATO forces was roughly 1,000 miles. Today, that distance is roughly 100 miles. ""By Russian military calculations, they just can't afford this sort of thing because it's a military threat,"" Koffler said. All of those issues, Koffler says, suggest Putin feels trapped and will lash out in any way he can in order to get out of the proverbial corner which includes cyberattacks, satellite disruption, bombing civilian areas, and using his nuclear capabilities if ""push comes to shove."" ""He will run his troops into the ground,"" Koffler said, adding that he will ""level Kyiv"" if he feels that is ""what he needs to do.""",World/Fox News,Russia expert: Putin 'cornered like a rat' and will do whatever necessary to lash out,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-expert-putin-apos-cornered-001645710.html
3/13/2022,"By Ali Kucukgocmen ISTANBUL (Reuters) -A Turkish court on Friday sentenced journalist Sedef Kabas to more than two years in prison after ruling that she insulted the president, despite a ruling by Europe's top rights court that the relevant law should be amended to safeguard free expression. Thousands of people have been tried and convicted under the law covering insults to the president in Turkey, including pro-Kurdish politician Selahattin Demirtas, one of most prominent opposition figures. Turkey is one of the world's top jailer of journalists and mainstream media is controlled by those close to President Tayyip Erdogan's government, with coverage favouring his administration. Kabas, a 52-year-old television journalist who mainly covers Turkish politics, had been in pre-trial detention since late January. She was sentenced to two years and four months in prison on Friday but released pending an appeal against the verdict, her lawyer Bahar Unluer Ozturk told Reuters. Kabas was acquitted of additional charges of insulting Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu and Transportation Minister Adil Karaismailoglu, Ozturk added. The alleged insult was in the form of a proverb related to a palace that Kabas uttered both on an opposition television channel and on her Twitter account. Her comments at the time drew condemnation from government officials, who appeared to take them as referring to Erdogan and the presidential palace. While the Turkish government has not commented publicly on the law, members of Erdogan's AK Party at the time decried Kabas' comments, calling them ""unacceptable"" and ""immoral"". The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) stated in October that the legislation outlawing insults to the Turkish president should be changed, after ruling that freedom of expression was violated due to detentions imposed under the law. More than 160,000 investigations were launched on suspicion of insults to Erdogan since 2014, the year he became president, with more than 12,880 convictions. More than 31,000 investigations were launched in 2020. The ECHR said Turkey's law affords the head of state a privileged status regarding the expression of information and opinion about them. It said the law should be amended to ensure people have the freedom to hold opinions and impart ideas without interference by authorities.
