5/9/2022,"Polls opened in the Philippines on Monday as the country decides its next president in a polarising race between frontrunner Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son of the late dictator, and a human rights lawyer who has vowed to tackle old, rotten politics. Opinion surveys suggest Marcos Jr, known as Bongbong, is poised to win the election, despite his family’s notorious history of human rights abuses and corruption. The Marcoses plundered as much as $10bn from the state, while thousands of his opponents were arrested, tortured and killed. Analysts say the Marcoses and their supporters have harnessed the power of social media to rebrand the family name and spread disinformation that downplays or denies past atrocities. False claims have been spread widely online, portraying Marcos Sr’s rule as a golden age of prosperity and peace. Marcos Jr denies any coordinated online network. Marcos Jr has not apologised for his family’s political history, and instead praised his father as a “political genius”, and his mother, Imelda, as the dynasty’s “supreme politician” during a recent interview. Imelda Marcos, infamous for her collection of 3,000 pairs of shoes, is appealing against a 2018 criminal conviction on seven graft charges. Marcos Jr, whose slogan is “together we shall rise again”, has campaigned with a message of unity and rekindling a former greatness. He is running in tandem with the daughter of populist president Rodrigo Duterte, Sara, who is vying for the vice-presidency, an arrangement that has further boosted the Marcos camp. President Duterte remains popular as he nears the end of his six-year term limit, despite attracting condemnation from rights groups over his bloody so-called “war on drugs”. He has not endorsed a presidential candidate. Opinion surveys suggest Marcos is far ahead of his opponents. One recent poll found he was the preferred candidate of 56% of respondents. Marcos’ biggest threat is Leni Robredo, the current vice-president and a former pro bono human rights lawyer, who has promised good and competent governance. As vice-president – a position elected separately from the president – she has frequently clashed with president Rodrigo Duterte, and has condemned his “war on drugs”, which has killed as many as 30,000 people according to some estimates, and prompted an investigation by the international criminal court. Robredo’s campaign has gathered momentum in the run-up to the election, with large crowds attending her rallies and almost 2 million people, many of them young voters, volunteering to go door to door to win support for her campaign. About 67 million people are eligible to vote, with polling stations opening from 6am on Monday for a longer period of 13 hours to ensure social distancing. Vote counting will begin as soon as the ballots close, and in the past the winner has become apparent within hours. However, some analysts say Covid measures may slow down the process this year, and have speculated that the race could be tighter than polling suggests, pointing to the large turnouts at Robredo’s rallies. The Philippine police and military said on Sunday they were on high alert ahead of the vote, with the armed forces chief, Lt Gen Andres Centino, stating they were committed to ensuring “secure, accurate, free and fair elections”.The winner will take office on 30 June and lead for a single, six-year term.",News/World news,Philippines election 2022: voting begins to decide next president ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/philippines-presidential-election-2022-voting-begins-leni-robredo-ferdinand-bongbong-marcos-jr-polls-open-president
5/9/2022,"The government must introduce legislation to protect child social media influencers from exploitation, according to MPs. The rise of influencers has produced a new outlet for the UK’s creative industries and boosted the UK economy but it has also brought considerable risks, said the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee. Julian Knight, the Conservative chair of the committee, said the phenomenon had exposed influencers and their followers to harm. “The rise of influencer culture online has brought significant new opportunities for those working in the creative industries and a boost to the UK economy,” he said. “However, as is so often the case where social media is involved, if you dig below the shiny surface of what you see on screen you will discover an altogether murkier world where both the influencers and their followers are at risk of exploitation and harm online.” Influencers produce content on platforms such as YouTube, Instagram and TikTok for followers who often run into the millions. The biggest influencers in the UK include Zoe Sugg, a fashion and beauty “vlogger” whose YouTube channel has 4.9 million subscribers, Brooklyn Beckham and a procession of contestants on reality shows such as Love Island. However, the report raised specific concerns around children, influencer pay and the flouting of advertising guidelines that require creators to inform users when they have been paid to make a post. The MPs raised concerns about child influencers, or “kidfluencers”, who earn income through sponsorship and partnership with brands. The content is mostly aimed at other children and, because the minimum age for an Instagram account or setting up a YouTube channel is 13, many of these accounts are managed by parents. Children are also involved in content from family or parenting influencers. According to one estimate, there are at least 10,000 parent influencers in the UK and one witness told MPs that the UK was “notable” for its prevalence of child influencers. However, the committee said it had heard concerns from witnesses that some children are being used by parents to capitalise on the lucrative child and family influencing market. The report recommends that the government “urgently” addresses gaps in UK child labour and performance regulations that are leaving child influencers unprotected. New legislation should include provisions on working hours and conditions and protecting a child’s earnings. “We are deeply concerned that a lack of action in the booming influencer market will lead to even more children in the industry being exploited,” said the report. The report also addresses a key earner for influencers: being paid by brands to promote their products. This practice has drawn warnings from the UK advertising watchdog, which is concerned that some influencers are not admitting when they are being paid to promote certain content. The report recommends that the Advertising Standards Authority is given statutory power to enforce its codes, which ban putting up a paid-for post and not declaring that it is an advert. Currently, the organisation can “name and shame” transgressors, but not fine them. The report also recommends giving the competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority, greater powers to enforce consumer protection law. Although social media influencing is a booming business – with global marketing revenue expected to rise from $6bn in 2020 to $24bn by 2025 – the report warned that pay is inconsistent for the vast majority of British influencers. The committee urged the government to launch an investigation into influencer pay. “The government should investigate pay standards and practice in the influencer marketplace. This should encompass the various revenue streams available to influencers, including deals between influencers and third parties as well as revenue-sharing mechanisms from the major social media platforms.”",News/Media,"UK must protect child influencers from exploitation, MPs say",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/09/uk-must-protect-child-influencers-exploitation-social-media
5/9/2022,"Universities across England have come out against proposals for limiting student numbers and access to loans, describing the plans as likely to crush aspirations and entrench disadvantage. Responding to the government’s consultation, the three main university groups have lined up with the National Union of Students in opposing plans to limit undergraduates taking “low value” courses and stop students from receiving government-backed tuition fee and maintenance loans if they do not have minimum GCSE or A-level grades. Universities UK (UUK), which represents the leaders of mainstream universities in England, said it “strongly opposes” any introduction of number caps, saying it would most hurt those from disadvantaged backgrounds. “As well as limiting student choice, student number caps entrench disadvantage because students who are unable to move location to attend university have fewer opportunities to apply and be accepted to university, making them more likely to choose a path with poorer employment outcomes,” UUK said. Disadvantaged students are also among those likely to be most affected by minimum eligibility requirements for loans. UUK warned that the restrictions would have “significant financial implications” for universities, “limiting their ability to provide support for their disadvantaged students and invest locally”. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that restricting loans to students with GCSE passes in maths and English, as suggested in the government’s consultation, would have a disproportionate impact on ethnic minority students as well as students who had received free school meals. Larissa Kennedy, the NUS president said: “This government parrots the language of ‘levelling up’ but these proposals are classist, ableist and racist: they cruelly target those from marginalised communities and seek to gatekeep education.” The University Alliance (UA), representing the UK’s leading professional and technical universities such as Coventry and Teesside, said the proposals “will only serve to crush aspiration and exacerbate disadvantage”, jeopardising graduate numbers in key areas such as social work and computer science. The UA also attacked the proposal to cut funding for students taking foundation year courses, saying they would make the courses unviable and harming disadvantaged and mature students who used them to enter higher education. Vanessa Wilson, the UA’s chief executive, said: “The areas of focus for the proposed higher education reforms are way off the mark and, if implemented, the casualties … will be the poorest and most disadvantaged in society.” Rachel Hewitt, the chief executive of the MillionPlus group – which represents modern universities such as Bath Spa and the University of Cumbria – said the policies had “profound and far-reaching implications”. “MillionPlus remains fundamentally opposed to minimum entry requirements, which are against the core principles of inclusion, aspiration and the power of education,” Hewitt said. “Universities are best placed to make a determination as to the suitability of each candidate on their own merits. On a purely practical level, minimum requirements are likely to be unworkable, due to the number of exemptions that would need to be taken into account, for example for students with special educational needs.” In response, a Department for Education spokesperson said: “We have not proposed to bar anyone from going to university: rather, we are starting a conversation on minimum entry requirements and asking whether young people should be pushed straight into a full degree, without being prepared for that level of study. “We are proposing exemptions for mature students, those with a foundation year, or appropriate certificate or diploma and are supporting these alternative routes through consulting on reducing the cost of foundation years and through our new lifelong loan entitlement, which will provide many different routes to improve a person’s career and life opportunities. “These exemptions would mean 1% or fewer of total entrants would be affected by either of the minimum eligibility requirement proposals. “Similarly, the government is not proposing to cap the overall number of people going to university and recognises the transformational power of higher education. We are, however, consulting on how we might prevent low quality courses with poor outcomes from growing uncontrollably.” However, the DfE’s own equality impact assessment of the proposals found that restricting access to loans “would disproportionately affect students who are black and from ethnic minority groups”. Black students account for 27% of those enrolled with no GCSE pass grades in English and maths, compared with 8% of students who would be exempt.",News/Education,Universities oppose plan for student cap and loans in England,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/09/universities-oppose-plan-for-student-cap-and-loans-in-england
5/9/2022,"More than 2 million adults in the UK have gone without food for a whole day over the past month because they cannot afford to eat, according to a survey revealing the “catastrophic” impact of the cost of living crisis. The latest survey of the nation’s food intake shows a 57% jump in the proportion of households cutting back on food or skipping meals over the first three months of this year, with one in seven adults (7.3 million) estimated to be food-insecure, up from 4.7 million in January. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, described the findings as devastating, saying they exposed how families were being left in desperate hardship. “Boris Johnson is responsible for this crisis and has no solutions to fix it,” he said. The survey came as one of Britain’s biggest energy suppliers called for urgent government action to help households cope with an anticipated £1,000 rise in bills this winter. The London fire brigade, meanwhile, was forced to issue an urgent safety warning against improvising fires at home, after a man set fire to his house by burning timber in his living room to keep warm. The research by the Food Foundation thinktank found millions more people – including 2.6 million children – report they now have smaller meals than usual, regularly skip meals altogether or do not eat when they are hungry, as food insecurity returns to levels last seen at the start of the first national lockdown. However, while many reported missing out on meals or eating irregularly during the first months of the pandemic because of food scarcity caused by panic buying and supply problems, the latest increase is put down to rising costs and poverty. Food banks are reporting that energy costs are so prohibitive for some people they request that charity food parcels that contain no food that has to be cooked using a cooker or that needs to be stored in a fridge or freezer. The rapid deterioration in food security reflects soaring energy, food and petrol prices coupled with below-inflation benefit rises. The Food Foundation said it was so shocked by its initial findings that it reran the survey on a wider basis, only to get the same results. It predicted food insecurity figures were likely to get worse over the next few months as inflation continues to rise and the full impact of April’s national insurance rise hits family budgets along with the lifting of the energy price cap. Anna Taylor, the foundation’s executive director, said: “The extremely rapid rise in food insecurity since January points to a catastrophic situation for families. Food insecurity puts families under extreme mental stress and forces people to survive on the cheapest calories, which lead to health problems.” Prof Sir Michael Marmot, a public health expert at University College London, said: “If one household in seven is food insecure, society is failing in a fundamental way. These figures on food insecurity are all the more chilling because the problem is soluble, but far from being solved it is getting worse.” There is little expectation that ministers will raise benefits or expand free school meals anytime soon, despite rising public concern over the cost of living. Last week, George Eustice, the environment, food and rural affairs secretary, urged consumers to switch to value brands to save on grocery spending in response to rising food prices. “Bless him [Eustice], he’s actually aware there are cheaper brand foods in the world. The poor man, who has lived such a sheltered life he thought 10p off a tin of beans would solve the problem,” said Kathleen Kerridge, an office manager and food activist from Portsmouth. On the food poverty frontline, charities are warning that demand for food is rising as budgets get tighter. Ellen-Scarlett Ryan, of Bassetlaw food bank in Worksop, said it supplied 24 households with food parcels on the day after Easter last month, way ahead of its previous record of 16. Many of these clients had never before used food banks and were struggling with their newfound reliance on charity to feed their families, Ryan said. “We are finding people in floods of tears. They are so scared, they are at their wits’ end. It is such a difficult and emotional time.” Households were making the food go further, she said, putting smaller portions on the table and bulking out dishes with lentils and rice. A growing number were asking for food that did not require cooking with the gas on, as they could not afford to put cash in the meter. On Monday Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, said a fresh support package would be vital before a further dramatic increase in the cost of gas and electricity bills due in October. A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures on the cost of living and we are doing what we can to help, including spending £22bn across the next financial year to support people with energy bills and cut fuel duty. “For the hardest hit, we’re putting an average of £1,000 more per year into the pockets of working families on universal credit, have also boosted the minimum wage by more than £1,000 a year for full-time workers and our household support fund is there to help with the cost of everyday essentials.”",News/Society,"More than 2m adults in UK cannot afford to eat every day, survey finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/09/more-than-2m-adults-in-uk-cannot-afford-to-eat-every-day-survey-finds
5/9/2022,"People should not try to reduce their energy bills by improvising open fires at home, fire chiefs have warned, after a man in south-west London set fire to his property by burning timber in his living room to keep warm. The man was trying to avoid putting on the central heating in his home, fire investigators said. Fuel poverty campaigners said the incident – one of at least 100 involving open fires, log burners and heaters in the capital in the last few months – laid bare “the harsh and dangerous reality of the cost-of-living crisis”. Issuing an urgent safety warning, the London fire brigade (LFB) said the cause of the blaze on 26 April had been determined as “involving an open fire being used instead of gas central heating.” It is understood to have also been caused by combustible items too close to an open fire. The London ambulance service said it treated three people at the property in New Malden, with one man being taken to hospital as a priority. The LFB said there had been more than 100 fires involving open fires, log burners and heaters in the past few months. It fears the rise in energy bills could result in a surge of fires as people resort to alternative means to heat their homes throughout the colder spells of the year.Charlie Pugsley, assistant commissioner for fire safety, said: “We know this is a difficult time and people are thinking about ways to reduce their energy bills, but we’re really concerned that they may be putting lives at risk by doing so. “If you do have a log burner or an open fire, follow our advice carefully. Almost 30% of fires involving log burners, heaters and traditional open fires are caused by items being placed too close to a heat source. Always use a fire guard and keep anything that could catch alight well away, such as logs and kindling which could be ignited by radiating heat.” Adam Scorer, the chief executive of the fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, described the incident as a “harsh and dangerous reality of the cost-of-living crisis”. “One in four UK households are now in fuel poverty, which means millions are facing impossible choices because of their high energy bills,” he said. “Some are choosing between heating and eating, others are self disconnecting completely and some are even starting open fires. These aren’t coping strategies. It’s people who feel they have no safe choice to make.”A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we have set out a £22bn package of support, including rebates and energy bill reductions.” ",News/UK news,London fire chiefs warn against fires in homes to save on heating bills ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/09/london-fire-chiefs-warn-against-fires-in-homes-to-save-on-heating-bills
