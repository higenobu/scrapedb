1/28/2022,"Gina Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting has been announced as a sponsor for the Australian Olympic Team through to 2026. The Australian Olympic Committee announced the partnership on Friday morning, saying it will encompass the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, Paris 2024 Summer Olympics, and the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics in February 2026.  The mining giant will also “support” Australian Teams to Youth Olympic Games in Gangwon 2024 and in Dakar 2026, the Pacific Games in 2023. Rinehart, Hancock Prospecting’s executive chair, has previously been criticised for warning against climate change “propaganda” in education. In a speech last year she said she said had once helped to convince students climate change was not human-induced, by organising a talk at a school by climate skeptic Lord Christopher Monckton and told students to “do their own independent research” on “which comes first – global warming, or an increase in carbon?”. She’s also warned that a move towards reducing emissions would cost billions in taxpayer money. Rinehart is quoted in the statement as saying her company was “proud” to support the Australian teams, adding that she believed athlete’s “work, dedication, focus and self-discipline” were important to “succeed in life and business”. “We are delighted to take the next step in our long-term support of Australia’s best athletes and become an official Australian Olympic Committee partner, an organisation admirably independent of Government funding and aligned to our values at the Hancock Group,” she said. “We are so proud to help our great Olympians who are such inspirations, through their hard work, most do not really know how hard they work, dedication, focus and self-discipline, as they endeavour to represent our country to the best of their ability. “The traits these role models show in my view, are important for us all, if we wish to succeed in life and business.” Dual Olympian Rhydian Cowley accused the deal of undermining “the AOC’s sustainability action plan”. The term “sportswashing” has been used to refer to the use of sporting sponsorships by carbon-emitting industries to project a healthier image. Rinehart said she believed there was a need for greater scrutiny of how taxpayer money was allocated. “We believe government or sponsor funds should be used to ensure sport is at the service of the community and the athletes, and much tighter scrutiny of taxpayers and sponsors funds would assist,” she said Rinehart has declared herself one of Australia’s biggest Olympics fan, and has contributed $10m annually. AOC President, John Coates, “greatly welcomed” the partnership, saying it would deliver “significant benefits” to the Australian teams. “This is a major commitment to Australian sport. We welcome and thank Mrs Gina Rinehart and Hancock Prospecting for this investment. On the eve of farewelling our Team to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games, the timing is perfect. “There is no coincidence that the strong support of Mrs Gina Rinehart for many of our athletes in Tokyo yielded excellent results. There were so many golden moments and success in the pool, our rowers had a wonderful Games, as did our beach volleyballers.” Coates added: “The AOC is proudly independent of government. We neither receive nor seek federal funding for our day-to-day operations. We are grateful to have the support of Mrs Gina Rinehart, Hancock Prospecting and all our partners to ensure we retain that independence.” It comes only days after Rinehart, Australia’s richest person, was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia “for distinguished service to the mining sector, to the community through philanthropic initiatives, and to sport as a patron”.",News/Business,Gina Rinehart’s company announced as sponsor of Australian Olympic Team ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/28/gina-rinehart-company-announced-as-sponsor-of-australian-olympic-team
1/28/2022,"At the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, it seems, revenge is a dish best served cold. Three years after the former feminist columnist Clementine Ford walked away from her column and accused the Herald of losing its independence, an interview with the author was spiked after it had been written by an Age journalist, published online and printed in Saturday’s Spectrum.  On Thursday the interview Kerrie O’Brien conducted over lunch with Ford about her new book How We Love appeared online, complete with a photo of the $300 lunch tab. The hard copy of the article was ready to go too, as it is printed ahead of the news section. But soon the online story had disappeared and that particular page in Spectrum was torn up and re-printed. Tory Maguire, the executive editor of the Herald and the Age, confirmed the story had been pulled at the 11th hour. “Clementine Ford spent years making vile and personal attacks on the journalists and editors of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age after the mastheads stopped publishing her column,” Maguire told Weekly Beast. “I had knocked back a pitch for an interview with her but there was a breakdown in communication and it was commissioned and published in error. I have pulled it from Spectrum and taken it down out of respect for my team.” The animosity was sparked by Ford’s harsh criticism of the Herald on Twitter, and in an article for Schwarz Media’s the Saturday Paper. Ford was angered by getting an official warning from her editor for calling Scott Morrison a “fucking disgrace” on social media and said she quit because of the “cultural shift” at the newspapers, which are now owned by Nine Entertainment. She went on to write that “the change in political culture at Fairfax began long before the television network set its sights on establishing a newspaper presence”. “To my mind, the trajectory traces back to the appointment in March 2018 of James Chessell as Fairfax’s group executive editor of Australian Metro Publishing … he has also been an adviser to former Liberal treasurer Joe Hockey, as well as a known associate of many in business and finance,” she wrote. Chessell, since promoted to Nine’s managing director of publishing – with responsibility for the Australian Financial Review, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, Brisbane Times and WAToday – as you can imagine is no fan of Ford’s. Ford, who had no idea what had happened to the piece when we contacted her, was disappointed readers wouldn’t get to read about the “lovely chat” she had with O’Brien. She told Weekly Beast that “if something as gentle and inoffensive as a piece about love can be spiked as retaliation against valid journalistic critique” then “I do think readers should think carefully about what that means”. She maintained her criticism of the masthead had never been directed at its staff but mainly at Chessell and senior management. We are used to journalists quitting reporting to join the so-called dark side as advisers and lobbyists but when they go the other way it can ruffle feathers. Long-term Santos spinner Tom Baddeley has represented the oil and gas producer as the manager, government and community relations in Western Australia and the Northern Territory for 12 years. Before that he was WA’s director for the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, the peak national body representing the oil and gas industry. A former journalist who left the ABC in 2005, Baddeley starts on 7 February as ABC Radio Perth’s new Breakfast presenter, replacing Russell Woolf, who died suddenly last October. Govt affairs for Santos is not just any old corporate job https://t.co/JcSjwiBOST Some environmental campaigners are concerned about the appointment given Santos is a powerful player – it was the fossil fuel company which the government hosted at its pavilion at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow last year. Baddeley, who has appeared before the NT’s fracking inquiry, will now have to present an objective journalistic voice on all the issues he used to prosecute for Santos. We think the ABC may have sensed a problem as the press release announcing the appointment reached back 14 years on Baddeley’s CV to find a job that wasn’t related to fossil fuel lobbying. “He began his journalism career with The West Australian and after leaving the ABC in 2005, went on to work in media relations, government relations, policy advocacy and public affairs including as Communications Manager for WA’s then new Super Rugby team, the Western Force,” the ABC said. An ABC spokesperson said ABC Radio broadcasters have a diverse range of experiences and come to the organisation from many different backgrounds. “Tom Baddeley is an experienced journalist and former ABC reporter,” the spokesperson said. “When he takes to the Perth airwaves, next month he will be subject to the same editorial standards and ABC Editorial Policies that all of our employees must meet. He will be required to present independent and balanced content at all times, regardless of the topic or interview subject.” With Covid-19 in Australia deaths passing 3,000 we were quite startled by a headline in the Australian Financial Review that the pandemic had an upside. It was, according to Michael Stutchbury’s AFR, good for rich people. “COVID was a great wealth-creation event,” declared senior correspondent Aaron Patrick in an article that argued that for some homeowners “the pandemic was the greatest wealth-creation event of their lives”. Patrick is well known to Beast readers for his hit job on Samantha Maiden last year which backfired spectacularly. Apparently all this wealth was good news for the prime minister, who would be rewarded at the next election by happy, cashed-up voters. Watch out Albo. “The consequences of a more prosperous-feeling society will be seen in the election campaign,” Patrick wrote. “Labor leader Anthony Albanese will have to be more cautious; more wary of frightening a nation asking itself: what’s the compelling reason to replace the government under which we have become so much richer?” Still on Patrick, the National Press Club board will discuss a request to rescind an award he won for an article that the WA supreme court subsequently found “contained incorrect statements of fact”. Last month justice Rene Le Miere awarded $400,000 to Dr Jemma Green, who sued for defamation over two articles published in the Fin in December 2018 about her technology company Powerledger. Le Miere said the imputation in the articles by Patrick was defamatory and the defendants had been unable to establish that it was substantially true or that it was their honest opinion, adding that nominating himself for the award during legal proceedings was an “aggravating factor” in the defamation. The judge was also scathing about Patrick’s decision to criticise defamation law on the eve of the trial in September 2020 in an article that claimed Green’s action was “sucking up financial resources that could be used to fund investigative journalism”. Le Miere found that the September article constituted a publication by Patrick and the AFR of an act of intimidation or reprisal or ill will towards Green for suing them. The judgment found the articles had several inaccuracies, and conveyed serious defamatory imputations against Green. NPC’s chief executive Maurice Reilly told Weekly Beast he had referred the matter to legal counsel for an opinion. “The judgment it should be noted is against the AFR and Aaron and not the National Press Club,” he said. “We don’t have that opinion as yet and the board will consider when it meets in February.” The judgment said while the award judges would not have known about the legal action, the newspaper did. “In those circumstances it was improper for Mr Patrick to nominate himself for the award and state that the article was an objective look at blockchain technology,” Le Miere said. The AFR did not respond to a request for comment. 60 Minutes will launch its 2022 season on 6 February with an exclusive interview with the family of Cleo Smith, an interview which is reportedly part of a $2m multimedia deal Nine Entertainment made with Ellie Smith and stepfather Jake Glidden. The program released a promo to tease the upcoming show which they claim contains “startling revelations to reporter Tara Brown about what really happened to their precious daughter”. The Australian reported the deal includes plans for a drama, likely to be a six-part special for Nine’s streaming service Stan. And all this before the man accused of abducting her is sentenced. Terence Darrell Kelly, 36, on Monday admitted taking the four-year-old from a tent at the remote Blowholes campsite last year.",News/Media,It took three years but the SMH finally got its revenge on Clementine Ford – kind of | The Weekly Beast,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/28/it-took-three-years-but-the-smh-finally-got-its-revenge-on-clementine-ford-kind-of
1/28/2022,"Sarah Palin, the former Republican vice-presidential candidate, has continued to dine out at New York City restaurants despite testing positive for Covid-19.  The ex-Alaska governor, who is not vaccinated, was spotted on Wednesday eating outdoors at the upper east side restaurant Elio’s after testing positive for the illness, according to photos published by Mediaite. Palin had dined at the same restaurant on Saturday night, where she was seen eating indoors in violation of city rules requiring proof of vaccination for indoor dining. Palin was also seen eating outdoors Tuesday night at Campagnola, Gothamist reported. Under CDC guidance, people with Covid-19 should isolate for at least five days to avoid further spread. The manager of Elio’s restaurant told the New York Times it was investigating Palin’s Saturday visit and that the restaurant had made a “mistake”. The manager told the Times that Palin had “probably just walked in and strolled over” to a table where she joined a regular customer. Palin returned to the restaurant Wednesday evening. “Tonight Sarah Palin returned to the restaurant to apologize for the fracas around her previous visit,” Luca Guaitolini, Elio’s manager, said in a statement to Mediaite. “In accordance with the vaccine mandate and to protect our staff, we seated her outdoors. We are a restaurant open to the public and we treat all civilians the same.” Palin confirmed her positive Covid test on Monday, which has delayed the start of her defamation trial against the New York Times in relation to a 2017 editorial on comments she made about gun violence. City officials have encouraged New Yorkers who come into contact with Palin to test for Covid-19, and warned that she needs to “follow the rules just like everyone else”. “By repeatedly flouting CDC guidelines, Ms Palin has shown a complete disregard for the health and safety of small business workers and her fellow patrons,” Jonah Allon, a New York city hall spokesperson, said in a statement to the Washington Post. “We encourage Ms Palin to join the 98% of New Yorkers who report they have followed guidance on isolation and have helped New York City stop the spread.” Palin had previously tested positive for the illness in March 2021, but has been adamant about her opposition to receiving the vaccine. “It’ll be over my dead body that I’ll have to get a shot. I will not do that. I won’t do it, and they better not touch my kids either,” she said at a conservative event in December 2021. Vaccines offer crucial protection against serious illness and death from Covid-19, and are considered an important tool to prevent the development of new variants such as Omicron, which led to a rise in cases across the country. US cases, including in New York, have begun to fall after a surge around the holidays. More than 877,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US since the start of the pandemic.",News/US news,Sarah Palin dined at multiple New York restaurants despite positive Covid test,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/27/sarah-palin-dined-at-multiple-new-york-restaurants-despite-positive-covid-test
