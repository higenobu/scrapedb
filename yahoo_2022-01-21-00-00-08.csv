1/21/2022,"The Trump Org valued a golf course in Scotland based on a media quote, per a legal filing. The firm said the the course was worth $161 million, five years after Trump bought it for $12.6 million. Trump denies wrongdoing and claims the investigation is politically motivated. The Trump Organization based its $161 million valuation for one of Donald Trump's Scottish golf resorts on a quote a company executive gave to Forbes magazine, New York Attorney General Letitia James alleged. In legal documents released Tuesday, the office of the New York attorney general claimed that properties and other assets had been falsely valued by the Trump Org in financial statements as part of a possible fraud scheme. One of the businesses is the Trump International Golf Club Scotland, which is located near the city of Aberdeen. According to the filing, the property was bought by the Trump Organization, the umbrella company for Trump's businesses, in 2006 for $12.6 million. But in financial statements in 2011 it was valued at £75 million, or $161 million. ""This valuation appears to have been based on an email prepared to provide information to Forbes magazine for a quote and was not professionally determined,"" a statement from James's office said. The email containing the valuation was sent by former Trump Org executive George Sorial, according the documents. Sorial's told Forbes, as described in the legal documents, that ""although a formal appraisal has not been prepared at this point,"" the $161 million valuation was arrived at by ""speaking with specialists in the field and having closely watched this development transform itself over the last five years."" Insider has contacted the Trump Organization and Sorial for comment. —Ilya Marritz (@ilyamarritz) January 19, 2022 In a statement Wednesday, the Trump Organization claimed the investigation was a politically motivated bid to damage its owner. ""The only one misleading the public is Letitia James. She defrauded New Yorkers by basing her entire candidacy on a promise to get Trump at all costs without having seen a shred of evidence and in violation of every conceivable ethical rule,"" Trump said in the statement. James's office also alleged that misleading values had been given for other properties, including Trump's Park Avenue apartment complex and his Westchester golf club. The documents were released after Trump sought to quash a subpoena seeking testimony from him, his son Donald Trump Jr., and his daughter Ivanka Trump.

1/21/2022,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The Navy will let Wisconsin keep its beloved badger statue for 50 more years, scrapping plans to move the sculpture to an East Coast museum. The statue, sculpted from melted-down cannons seized from Cuba during the Spanish-American War, was affixed to the first USS Wisconsin before World War I. The U.S. Naval Academy Museum lent it to the state in 1988. It has sat outside the governor's office in the state Capitol since 1989, delighting thousands of tourists who rub its nose for good luck. The academy museum contacted state officials in March 2020 asking for the statue's return so it could be lent to the nonprofit Nauticus Museum in Norfolk, Virginia, where the second USS Wisconsin is berthed as an exhibit. State historians balked, and U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican and former Marine, joined the effort to keep the statue in Madison. The Navy last February agreed to extend the loan for two more years. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers sent Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro a letter in November asking that the Navy transfer ownership of the statue to the state permanently. “The Badger should remain in Wisconsin where it is seen by tens of thousands of visitors each year and is one of the most popular and beloved attractions in our beautiful state Capitol building,” Evers wrote. “The Badger is not only part of the USS Wisconsin ... history, but it is now a part of the history of the Wisconsin State Capitol and a piece of pride for the Badger State and of residents from every corner of Wisconsin.” Del Toro sent Evers a letter Tuesday saying the Navy is happy to extend the loan for the next 50 years. “I prize the strong affinity that the citizens of Wisconsin have developed toward the badger statue; it reflects the state's proud maritime heritage and deep ties to the U.S. Navy,"" Del Toro wrote. “The Navy feels those ties, too, and we thank the people of Wisconsin for their ongoing interest in and support of our Navy and our nation's maritime history.” Marinette Marine manufactures battleships for the Navy. In 2020 the company won a $5.5 billion contract in 2020 to build a guided missile frigate and was selected to develop a prototype for a new unmanned ship capable for attacking land and sea targets.

1/21/2022,"Wendy Poulsen wanted “a bit of peace of mind” when she installed a tracking device inside the trunk of her 18-year-old daughter’s car, but she never imagined it would ultimately help catch her daughter’s killer. Poulsen’s adopted daughter, Dani, was discovered dead in her car on Sept. 1, 2019 from a fentanyl overdose, according to The New York Post. While the tragic death devastated Poulsen, the data collected within the tracking device was able to lead Minnesota investigators to Dani’s drug dealer, Calvonzo Burnett — a man who was also eventually held responsible for selling a lethal amount of fentanyl to another teen, Jordan Knudson, who died in December 2019. Toxicology reports showed that at the time of Dani's death she had Xanax, cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl in her system, according to The Minneapolis Star Tribune. Although the local newspaper never mentions Dani by name, the details of her death match those provided to The Post by Poulsen. Investigators discovered phone records between Dani and Burnett that showed the pair had exchanged 79 calls between Aug. 26 and 31, including one message on Aug. 29 where she asked for cocaine and Xanax. “I got everything,” Burnett allegedly texted back. Burnett was arrested the following February and pleaded guilty in October 2020 on two counts of third-degree murder for both deaths. As part of a plea deal, her received a five-year sentence for each count of third-degree murder to be served concurrently. At his sentencing, Burnett apologized to Poulson, the Post reported. “[The apology] was the most healing thing in the entire process,” Poulsen said. “Dani made a choice and he didn’t do this alone, but having him take some responsibility for [her death] made a difference to me.” Data from the device is credited with helping secure a conviction in both cases. “The tracker couldn’t help me control Dani’s behavior and I knew it wasn’t going to stop her from doing something,” Poulsen told the news outlet. “But it showed the most value in the end game.” Poulsen had installed the 3-inch-by2-inch SafeTrack device less than three months before her daughter’s death, after having grown increasingly worried about her daughter’s behavior.  Poulsen and her now ex-husband Gerald Sommerfeld, 61, had adopted Dani from Kazakhstan when she was just six months old, but as the teen grew older, she began to have feelings of abandonment by her biological parents, The Post reports. The child who once got good grades and loved karate and snowboarding began to experiment with marijuana and soon delved into more dangerous substances.  “She had such huge hopes and dreams for the future,” Poulsen said. “At first, she wanted to be an architect and then she thought about being [an agent] in the FBI.”  But Dani’s school work began to deteriorate and she began to lose interest in the athletic pursuits she had once loved. When she was arrested for a DUI in 2017, her mother became even more concerned and tried installing location apps on her daughter’s phone, but Dani — whose new dream had been to become a tattoo artist — always removed them.  It prompted Poulsen to install the tracking device under the carpet of her daughter’s trunk in the summer of 2019, where it went undetected until Dani’s death. The weekend Dani died, Poulsen had been staying at a remote family cabin and Dani had promised to watch the family’s five dogs at their Minneapolis home — but Poulsen didn't hear from her daughter.  After using the tracking device to find her car in a suburb of the Twin Cities, Poulson asked her step-daughter’s husband to go check on the vehicle.  When he did, he found Dani dead in the passenger seat.  “She was my everything,” Poulsen told The New York Post of the death. “There are times when I can’t figure out how to keep living.” In a tragic twist, Dani's death wasn’t the only loss for Poulsen and her family. Poulsen's brother Scott had also mysteriously vanished in 1991, when he was just 25 years old. His partial remains were discovered two years later by moose hunters in a rural area of Canada but, by then, it was too late for investigators to figure out how Scott had died.
