2/19/2022,"Trump's lawyers kept interrupting the judge at a contentious court hearing this week. The interruptions were so frequent that a law clerk had to step in. ""When the judge speaks, you have to stop speaking,"" the clerk told Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba. A lawyer for former President Donald Trump repeatedly interrupted the judge at a contentious hearing on Thursday and grew so heated at times that the law clerk had to remind her several times not to speak over the judge. The focus of the hearing were a set of subpoenas that New York attorney general Letitia James' office sent to Trump and his two eldest children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka. They came as part of a wide-ranging investigation into whether the Trump Organization broke banking, tax, and insurance laws. Lawyers for the Trump family asked the judge to quash the subpoenas, arguing among other things that the investigation was politically motivated and that James was improperly conducting a civil and criminal probe. At one point, Trump's attorney, Alina Habba, argued that James' investigation is ""invalid"" and tainted by political bias because the attorney general publicly criticized Trump. ""Let me just, let's say this is obvious, but I'm not the attorney disciplinary committee,"" New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron said when Habba said the investigation should be shut down. ""So some of these ethical questions, they're not, they're not in front of me. And I tend to say they're not part of the case, but I haven't totally —"" Habba cut in, saying, ""Your honor, how could you say that? They are very much a part of this case. You can't speak to someone based on your hatred for them. You can't —"" Then the law clerk, Allison Greenfield, interrupted to chastise Habba. ""When the judge speaks, you need to stop speaking,"" she said. ""I'm sorry,"" Habba replied. ""I thought he was done. My apology."" At another point in the hearing, Habba insisted that Trump did not violate any laws and pointed to the slew of legal and congressional investigations from the past several years into his business and personal life. While the judge was speaking, Habba again interrupted him to note that ""no charges have been brought in all these years."" The interruption prompted another reminder from Greenfield. ""When the judge speaks, you have to stop speaking,"" she told Habba. Engoron took the interruption in stride, saying, ""I appreciate your vigor, shall I say."" Habba also directly addressed Kevin Wallace, an attorney from James' office during the hearing. It was a breach of legal protocol, since lawyers are not supposed to engage in crosstalk — directly speak to each other — during court hearings. Wallace ignored Habba's comments to him, telling Engoron that he was ""not going to engage in crosstalk, your honor."" Habba also veered away from the focus of the hearing to air out right-wing conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and what Trump has alleged was an illegal plot to spy on his campaign and administration. ""I want to know, Mr. Wallace, Ms. James, are you going to go after Hillary Clinton for what she's doing to my client?"" Habba said, referring to the attorney general of New York and Kevin Wallace, an attorney representing her in the hearing. ""That she spied at Trump Tower in your state? Are you going to look into her business dealings?"" But Engoron cut off Habba's discussion of Clinton, saying it was irrelevant. ""The Clintons are not before me,"" he said. Engoron ruled after the hearing that Trump and his two children must comply with the subpoenas. ""The target of a hybrid civil/criminal investigation cannot use the Fifth Amendment as both sword and a shield; a shield against questions and a sword against the investigation itself,"" he wrote. ""When they are deposed, the New Trump Respondents will have the right to refuse to answer any questions that they claim might incriminate them, and that refusal may not be commented on or used against them in a criminal prosecution.""

2/19/2022,"One of the most shocking claims to surface from the tragic incident that took the life of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust came from Alec Baldwin, one of the stars of the western. During a recent ABC News interview, the actor said he ""didn't pull the trigger"" of the gun that fatally wounded Hutchins, even though he was pointing what he thought to be a harmless prop in her direction when it fired during a rehearsal for the film. New details from the ongoing investigation suggest this assertion is not as implausible as one might think. Vanity Fair reporter Anthony Breznican conducted numerous interviews surrounding the incident, including with the investigators looking into it. Santa Fe County district attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said her team conducted an informal experiment to see if what Baldwin was saying was possible. It turns out, it is. Lou Rocco/ABC via Getty Images Alec Baldwin Baldwin said he pulled back the hammer on the gun without pulling the trigger. ""One of the investigators in my office happens to have a very old type revolver, and so he brought it, at my request, so that we could look at it and see if that was at all possible,"" Carmack-Altwies told Vanity Fair. After two investigators, including the one who supplied the gun, examined the weapon, Carmack-Altwies came to a conclusion. ""You can pull the hammer back without actually pulling the trigger and without actually locking it,"" she explained. ""So you pull it back partway, it doesn't lock, and then if you let it go, the firing pin can hit the primer of the bullet."" It is unclear at this point what Carmack-Altwies and the investigators will do with this information. ""Our life with our family is all I care about,"" Alec Baldwin wrote to his wife Hilaria Baldwin in an emotional Instagram note posted after his interview with George Stephanopoulos aired The shooting occurred at the Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe, N.M., on Oct. 21, 2021. Rust director Joel Souza was injured but survived, while Hutchins died after being airlifted to the University of New Mexico Hospital. Investigators are looking into multiple factors that could have contributed to the tragedy. Hutchins' family is currently suing Baldwin and other Rust crew members for wrongful death. ""Halyna deserved to live,"" reads the complaint, which was obtained by PEOPLE. ""The Defendants had the power to prevent her death if they only held sacrosanct their duty to protect the safety of every individual on a set where firearms were present instead of cutting corners on safety procedures where human lives were at stake, rushing to stay on schedule and ignoring numerous complaints of safety violations."" Baldwin's attorney, Aaron Dyer, told EW in a statement that ""any claim that Alec was reckless is entirely false.""

2/19/2022,"(Corrects journal name in item about red blood cells) By Nancy Lapid Feb 18 (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review. Antibodies improve for months after mRNA vaccine Antibodies induced by mRNA COVID-19 vaccines keep improving in quality for at least six months while the immune system continues to ""train"" its antibody-producing B cells, according to a new study. After vaccination, some B cells become short-lived antibody-producing cells, while others join ""germinal centers"" in lymph nodes - essentially, a training camp where they mature and perfect their skills. ""Cells that successfully graduate (from germinal centers) can become long-lived antibody-producing cells that live in our bone marrow or 'memory B cells' that are ready to engage if the person gets infected,"" explained Ali Ellebedy of Washington University in St. Louis. Animal studies have suggested that so-called germinal center reactions last only weeks. But analyses of blood, lymph node tissue and bone marrow from volunteers who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine showed germinal center reactions induced by the shots lasted at least six months, with antibodies becoming increasingly better at recognizing and attacking the spike protein of the original version of SARS-CoV-2, Ellebedy's team reported on Tuesday in Nature https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04527-1. They did not test the mature antibodies' ability to neutralize variants, but in theory, Ellebedy said, the antibodies should be better able to recognize parts of the spike common to the variants and the original strain. More research is needed to know whether this robust germinal center response is unique to mRNA vaccines or if it is also induced by more traditional vaccines. Red blood cells damaged by COVID cause blood-vessel problems Dysfunctional red blood cells contribute to the blood vessel injuries common in severe COVID-19, according to laboratory studies that also may suggest a way to treat the problem. Many patients hospitalized for COVID-19 are thought to have damage to the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels, which can lead to blood clots, organ impairment, and other complications. New findings from the blood of 17 moderately ill COVID-19 patients and 27 healthy volunteers confirm ""profound and persistent endothelial dysfunction"" as an effect of the coronavirus, researchers reported on Wednesday in JACC: Basic to Translational Science https://www.jacc.org/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jacbts.2021.12.003. Compared to the red blood cells in healthy people, those from COVID-19 patients release fewer beneficial nitric oxide molecules and more detrimental inflammation-causing molecules, said Dr. Ali Mahdi of Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm. In combination with elevated levels of a certain enzyme, the inflammatory molecules injure the blood-vessel lining, his team found. As a result, the vessel cannot relax properly. The dysfunction is reversed by drugs that restore normal enzyme levels and limit production of the harmful molecules, Mahdi said. Whether test-tube findings can be replicated in people is not yet clear. The experiment was performed on the original coronavirus, so it is also unclear whether red blood cells are similarly affected in infections caused by variants of SARS-CoV-2. Global project helps low-income countries reuse N95 masks An international group of physicists, engineers and physicians has designed a cheap, easy-to-construct cabinet with ultraviolet-C (UV-C) bulbs that has allowed health clinics in lower-income countries to decontaminate and reuse over 900,000 protective N95 masks. The prototype was constructed using a metal office storage cabinet lined with household aluminum foil, with UV-C bulbs at the front and back, consortium members reported on Wednesday in NEJM Catalyst https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.21.0439. ""You simply load the masks on a rack, put them in the cabinet, shut the doors and turn the device on to apply the right dose of UV-C to inactivate the COVID-19 virus,"" said Dr. Nicole Starr, a surgery trainee at the University of California, San Francisco who led the effort. The process takes about 10 minutes. Once the group had a workable design, they recruited members of local student chapters of the optics society Optica to build the cabinets, sometimes working with embassies to arrange for shipments of the necessary components. Engineering teams in nine countries and hospitals in 12 countries worked on the project. ""Overall, 21 cabinets were put into use in hospitals, and we estimate that 930,000 N95s were decontaminated for reuse from July 2020 to January 2022,"" Starr said. Decontamination equipment currently used in U.S. hospitals can cost $80,000 per unit, according to the report. The team estimated that their cabinet can be built for about $500 to $1,500 depending on location and can process nearly 5,000 masks per day at maximum capacity.
