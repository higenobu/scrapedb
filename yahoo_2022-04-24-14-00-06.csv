4/24/2022,"In August of 2020 as the world cried out for justice for George Floyd’s murder at the hands of police, the quiet town of Tiburon, California was mismanaging its own officer encounters with the public. Married couple Yema Khalif and Hawi Awash were approached by an officer late one night as they restocked their Main St. sportswear store. Yema, the menswear boutique that bears the same name as one its owners, was the town’s only Black owned business, which was apparently all that was needed to draw attention from racist cops. Officer Isaac Madfes came into the store after closing around 1am on the night of August 21st. Madfes proceeded to ask what they were doing in the shop so late, interrogating the owners as they remained calm. The full incident was captured on Madfes’ body cam. “Is there a problem?” Khalif said.

Toasted: Jerk Chicken Empanadas and Mango Chili Sauce “I don’t want to argue,” the officer said. “I just want you to tell me why you’re here.” Khalif asked to speak to a supervising officer, and when Sgt. Michael Blasi arrived on the scene, he asked Khalif to stick his key in the lock to prove his ownership of the building. Just as he was about to give in to the sergeant’s demand, a white male neighbor interjected by shouting, “That’s his store!” from his balcony. The officers left shortly thereafter. The story wasn’t over though as Khalif initially threatened a $2M lawsuit in federal court for what he and his partner endured. The couple later decided however, to settle the dispute in a different matter. The point of difference turned out to be a set of reforms achieved with the assistance of the business owners and town officials. This past Tuesday, the reforms were announced by the couple in front of their clothing store. “For this to happen was very unfortunate and still is unfortunate,” Khalif said during a news conference in front of Yema. “We hope (the Tiburon agreement) is going to be something that other cities, other counties can actually copy.” According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the reforms include the expectation for officers to begin “carrying business cards with information about how to raise concerns over interactions.” Officers will also undergo bias training every two years as opposed to every five. “Aug. 21, 2020, was extremely traumatic,” Awash said Tuesday. “I’m happy that Tiburon has taken accountability and has made real, substantial policy changes.” While Sgt. Blasi resigned along with the Police Chief, Michael Cronin, Madfes retained his officer badge in Tiburon. Jon Welner, the city’s mayor, says that despite the tainting incident, he’s happy to see it resolved outside of court. “The changes proposed by Yema and Hawi are very positive, and will help make the Town of Tiburon a leader in the areas of diversity, inclusion, and transparency,” he said in a news release. In addition to the reforms, the couple were also awarded $150,000, a portion of which they say will fund a scholarship program already in place.",U.S./The Root,Black Couple Takes Justice Into Their Own Hands After Being Forced To Prove Ownership Of Their Clothing Store,https://news.yahoo.com/black-couple-takes-justice-own-192800003.html
4/24/2022,"New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was welcomed to Japan this week at a kiwifruit event where two large kiwi mascots greeted her with a dance routine to somber music.

In a video posted to Twitter by New Zealand reporter Henry Cooke, the two large mascots, known as the “Kiwi Brothers,” are seen swaying to a somber violin song in a room full of suited men. The cute mascots, depicted as a golden and green kiwi with large cartoonish eyes, were a part of a marketing event by New Zealand’s Zespri, the world’s largest kiwi distributor.

Ardern, who has not been on an overseas trip in more than two years, began her visit to Japan by attending the Zespri event. According to the Associated Press, Ardern traveled to Japan in hopes of increasing business and tourism partnerships following border closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

While posing for a photo with the Kiwi Brothers, Ardern was reportedly heard saying, “I feel like I’m photo bombing.”

This was Ardern's second encounter with the Kiwi Brothers since she first met them in 2019 while in Tokyo, Japan. Ardern described the photo as bringing her “such joy and delight” and stated that she still keeps a photo of the three holding hands in her office.

""The kiwi brothers I particularly remember, while they thankfully didn't make me dance, they did hold my hand,” Ardern recalled to News Hub. “That image brought such joy and delight to my office in New Zealand that to this day, the photo of my hand holding with the kiwi brothers still hangs in my office.”

The Kiwi Brothers are often used in promotional ads for Zespri in Japan and have even built a fanbase around the adorable mascots.
