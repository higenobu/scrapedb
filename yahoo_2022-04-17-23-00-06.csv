4/17/2022,"The dawn deadline Russia gave determined Ukrainian soldiers to surrender and lay down their weapons in Mariupol passed without incident on Sunday morning, as Vladimir Putin’s increasingly sloppy troops closed in on the strategic port city. Russia’s defense ministry, still reeling from the loss of 8th Army Major General Vladimir Frolov in combat on Saturday, was just as determined, threatening to “eliminate” any Ukrainian and foreign troops trying to hold on to the battered city. Russia has made considerable gains on the city after spending weeks trying to wipe it off the map. Western intelligence officials said it could fall to Russia soon, providing a key land bridge between Crimea and the eastern separatist regions it so desperately wants to take. Putin’s Hunted Me Down All Over the World President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that his fighters had only a small part of the city under their control. “The situation is very difficult in Mariupol,” he said overnight Sunday, according to CNN. “Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis ... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.” Russia warned in a statement Sunday that there were “up to 400 foreign mercenaries who joined the Ukrainian forces” huddling inside a steel plant, including many Europeans and Canadians who had come to support Ukrainian troops. “In case of further resistance, all of them will be eliminated,” the statement said. Further north, heavy bombardment on Ukraine’s second city Kharkiv killed and injured dozens of emergency workers and civilians, according to CNN which cited Kharkiv Regional Military Administration head Oleg Sinegubov. “They are currently receiving treatment in the hospital.” Sineguboy wrote on Telegram. “Thirty-one people were injured in Russian shelling, including four children.” He also wrote that Russian forces were using aerial bombardment, after being pushed back on land. “The enemy cannot approach Kharkiv as our armed forces are holding strong positions and are even advancing in some directions,” he said. “Therefore, Russians resort to shameful shelling of residential neighborhoods.” Bolstered by the gains in Mariupol and undeterred by the losses, Russian troops renewed efforts on Kyiv early Sunday, striking Brovary to the east. On Saturday, attacks on strategic targets further west in largely untouched Lviv also signaled that the war is at a turning point. Citing the Institute for the Study of War, the Washington Post reported Sunday that Russian troops were likely “setting conditions for a larger-scale, better-coordinated offensive.” Simply put, the worst may be yet to come.

4/17/2022,"Scientists from the University of Haifa, Israel, have been studying the wreck of the Ma'agan Mikhael B ship. Bodies of dead rats aboard the ship have given researchers clues as to where the ship came from. Carvings on the ship also show who may have worked aboard over 1,400 years ago. Rat skeletons found on the ancient wreck of a cargo ship that sunk off the coast of Israel are providing valuable new historical insights, according to researchers from the University of Haifa. Skeletons of dead rats on the ship labeled the Ma'gan Mikhael B, dated to between 648 and 740 C.E., have helped the team learn more about the life of the vessel that once sailed the Mediterranean. Speaking to Insider, Sierra Harding, a zooarchaeologist on the project, said the remains are the oldest and only direct evidence of a ship rat infestation on an ancient shipwreck in the Mediterranean. She explained some of the remains are of black rats, a species that traveled with traders to the Middle East from South Asia and India more than 2,000 years ago. However, using dental morphology, they discovered that other rats were ""exotic to the area."" Preliminary findings show that they could have originated from Tunisia or Corsica in the central Mediterranean. ""If it's confirmed that some of these rats were actually from as far away as the central Mediterranean islands –what this really means is that there was a lot more communication, shipping, exchange, and trade happening during this period that is primarily depicted as just army and naval battles,"" she said. An impressive array of preserved artifacts discovered on the sunken ship has helped fill in the picture of life aboard the ancient trading vessel. A 2020 preliminary report from the University of Haifa team found ""the largest maritime cargo assemblage of Byzantine and Early Islamic ceramics discovered along the Israeli coast to date."" It revealed the 82-foot-long vessel had a cargo of walnuts from Turkey and sauce made from fish from the Sea of Galilee. The study also provides clues to the ship's diverse crew, with Christian crosses, Muslim blessings (for example, the word ""Bismillah,"" meaning in the name of God), and Greek and Arabic letters carved into the walls, Harding told Insider. No human remains have been found aboard the wreck, indicating the crew made it ashore when the ship ran aground a short distance from the coast. When the ship sunk off the coast of Israel, it was immediately covered with up to seven feet of sand, helping to preserve its secrets, said Harding. The study is being led by an international team of researchers, including Harding, Dr. Ardern Hulme-Beaman from the University of Liverpool, Dr. Nimrod Marom from the University of Haifa, and Professor Deborah Cvikel from the University of Haifa is the Principal Investigator on the study.

4/17/2022,"A restaurant manager said he received hateful messages after showing his support for Ukraine. He flew a Ukrainian flag outside the Steakhouse he managed and received a negative response. One customer said: Take that trash flag down! May Ukraine be leveled to the ground!"" per WaPo. A Kentucky restaurant manager has recalled the hateful treatment he received from customers after he flew a Ukrainian flag in solidarity with the country, amid the war. Ben Ashlock, who heads Colton's Steak House and Grill in Bardstown, Kentucky, told The Washington Post that he has a personal connection to Ukraine because he and his wife adopted their son from there three years ago. So when the war broke out, Ashlock said he wanted to show solidarity by flying a Ukrainian flag at the restaurant. ""You just let them know, even in little old Kentucky, we see you, and we're supporting you,"" he told The Post. Ashlock didn't think any problems would arise from the gesture. But shortly after he flew the flag atop the building, Ashlock said he began to receive strong messages of hate from customers via the restaurant's phone, Facebook page, and Google reviews. One customer said, ""My family eats at Colton's steakhouse, but will not eat there again until the Ukrainian flag is replaced with our national Flag,"" via a direct message on the restaurant's Facebook page. The Post also referenced reviews — some of which had been removed — shared by Ashlock via screenshots. One said: ""Take that trash flag down! May Ukraine be leveled to the ground!"" Ashlock even said he received a 1-star review of Colton's on Google because of the flag. ""Food tasted woke, management is a war monger,"" the review read. Addressing the situation, Ashlock recently wrote on the restaurant's Facebook page: ""I would love to tell you that we heard our last negative comment today or that we had our last employee reduced to tears over someone saying something mean to them about our situation. But that would be lying."" ""I wish we treated each other better behind keyboards,"" he added. Colton's Steak House & Grill did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment made outside of normal working hours. The hateful messages however have recently been balanced by a flood of supportive messages on Colton's Facebook page. One person wrote: ""Thank you for flying the Ukraine flag and showing support to our Ukrainian brothers and sisters … I can't believe anyone would send hate messages for that.. what the hell has happened to us?"" Many restaurant owners across the US have shown their support for Ukraine in the war of Russia's unprecedented invasion. Some, for instance, renamed Russian-linked cocktails on menus, including Moscow Mules to Kyiv Mules.
