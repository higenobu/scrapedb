3/16/2022,"A man was charged with attempted murder in what police have described as a ""brutal hate crime"" against an Asian woman in New York state last week, with video of the incident showing the woman being punched over 100 times. Tammel Esco, 42, was arrested and accused of calling a 67-year-old woman an ""Asian b----,"" following her into a building and severely beating her Friday in Yonkers, just north of New York City. Esco was detained shortly thereafter when officers saw him still outside the building. Yonkers police announced the arrest and released security video from the building’s vestibule area Monday. The video shows the woman was trying to open the second door into the lobby when she was hit on the head from behind and fell to the ground. Video shows she was punched 125 times, stomped on seven more times and spat on. ""This is one of the most appalling attacks I have ever seen; to beat a helpless woman is despicable and targeting her because of her race makes it more so,"" Yonkers Police Commissioner John J. Mueller said in a statement. The woman, who was not publicly identified, is stable and recovering in a hospital, police said. She suffered facial bone fractures and bleeding on the brain. Esco was charged with attempted murder as a hate crime and one count of assault as a hate crime. He was arraigned Saturday and remained in custody at the Westchester County Jail on Monday, according to inmate records. He is being represented by the Westchester Legal Aid Society, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano called hate crimes ""intolerable."" ""I expect the suspect to be charged to the fullest extent of the law for his heinous actions,"" Spano said. ""I continue to keep the victim and her family in our thoughts and prayers.”",U.S./NBC News,Asian woman punched 125 times in New York attack; suspect charged with attempted murder as hate crime,https://news.yahoo.com/asian-woman-punched-125-times-214344331.html
3/16/2022,"Chris Hemsworth does a dehydration routine before filming a shirtless scene, his trainer says. He ups his water intake during the lead-up to filming, then drinks no water a day and a half before call time. His trainer says he ""wouldn't recommend"" the process, but they have found it helps make his muscles look denser and harder. Every shirtless scene Chris Hemsworth shoots as Thor has a grueling dehydration process behind it, according to his longtime trainer Luke Zocchi. Hemsworth has appeared shirtless in four movies in his role as Marvel's Thor. A week before he shoots a topless scene, Hemsworth gradually increases his water intake, then stops drinking water a day and a half before call time, Zocchi told Insider while promoting the lifestyle app, Centr, which he and Hemsworth founded. ""We start with three liters and everyday increase by one liter, and then by the end, he drinks seven liters of water,"" Zocchi said. ""Then around lunchtime before the scene, we cut water completely. This is by no means a healthy thing to do, and I wouldn't recommend that anyone else do this."" Zocchi said Hemsworth will simultaneously carb-cycle to prepare for the scenes. He depletes his body of carbs in the week leading up to filming, but then eats 40 grams of carbs every two hours in the last two days before call time. Zocchi said this process replenishes Hemsworth's muscles with glycogen after draining them of all their fluids, which makes them look denser and harder than they would naturally. ""So at the start of the day (before the scene) I would give him a sweet potato and brown rice, then closer towards the day I would give him rice cakes. And then half an hour before he stepped out I gave him snickers and a handful of lollipops, and he doubled in size by the end of the day,"" Zocchi said. Hemsworth also spends the last two days before filming doing high-rep, low-weight lifting workouts to build a pump in his muscles, Zocchi said. ""You're basically trying to look as hard and as dense as you can with your muscles and take all the fluid out of your body, and take out as much fat as you can,"" Zocchi said. Zocchi said he learned about this process from studying competitive bodybuilders, but added that he's seen contestants faint before or after competitions due to dehydration. A competitive bodybuilder named Mohammed Benaziza died at the age of 33 in 1992 from heart failure due to dehydration, according to Men's Health. Zocchi said that Hemsworth has gotten a headache or felt less energetic after his dehydration and carb-cycling routine, which are common symptoms of dehydration. There are also potential aesthetic downsides to the routine as well, according to a doctor. Doing this type of dehydration process can cause muscles to appear smaller in the future, Dr. Rand McClain, chief medical officer of the sports medicine clinic LCR Health, told Insider. McClain says dehydration can disrupt the low salt to water ratio in the body, which would cause muscles to flatten and shrink in size, which is ""the opposite of what they are trying to do."" Also, dehydrating the body after drinking a lot of water can send a signal to the body's cells that not enough sugar is in the blood, which can make a person hungrier and lead to more calorie consumption which could be converted to fat, McClain said.

3/16/2022,"Jeanine Pirro went ballistic on her Fox News co-host Geraldo Rivera on Tuesday for suggesting that Russian President Vladimir Putin manipulated Donald Trump to further Russian objectives. During a debate on “The Five,” Pirro suggested Putin didn’t invade Ukraine under Trump’s leadership because he was afraid of Trump. She also called Biden a “wuss” and declared him “responsible for the decline of the West.” “How do you know that Putin wasn’t playing Trump?” Rivera asked his colleague, sending her into a tailspin. “Oh, stop!” Pirro shouted. “He didn’t invade when Trump was president. It’s not about loving Trump. It’s about the fact that Trump had everybody against the wall. “I don’t give a damn what Putin thinks. I only care what Putin did. And he was a wuss when Trump was president, and that’s the end of it!” Jeanine Pirro says that Biden is a ""wuss,"" ""is responsible for the decline of the west"" and that he's ""destroying the west.""

After Geraldo asks how she knows ""Putin wasn't playing Trump,"" she absolutely loses it.

""Trump had everybody against the wall... [Putin] was a wuss!"" pic.twitter.com/ddTLVy4AK0 — Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) March 15, 2022 Trump and many of his allies in conservative media have been pushing the idea that Putin would not have invaded Ukraine under Trump due to what they perceive as his “strength.” Right-wing commentators have repeatedly blamed President Joe Biden for Putin’s invasion of neighboring Ukraine and have cast him as weak as the U.S. treads carefully to avoid a NATO conflict with Russia that could ultimately trigger in a nuclear war. Earlier in the segment, co-host Jesse Watters recalled “when Trump threatened to nuke everybody,” praising him for keeping things “relatively stable on the world stage.” “Biden’s approach is so conventional,” Watters complained. During an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity last week, Trump said that if he were president, he would be boasting about U.S. nuclear capabilities and saying things like “we don’t want to wipe out Russia.” Eric Trump told Hannity on Monday that Putin didn’t invade Ukraine during his father’s administration because “Putin was in with the KGB, he can read people, and he could tell that Donald Trump was a very strong person.” The U.S. and its NATO allies have foisted unprecedented economic sanctions on Russia and provided hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons and military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. They have stopped short of any moves that could provoke direct conflict with Russia. Trump repeatedly failed to call out Russian aggression against Ukraine during his tenure and often praised Putin and other autocrats while alienating U.S. allies. During the same broadcast of “The Five,” Pirro also offered a heated defense of oil companies, telling Rivera to “leave ’em alone” after he accused them of profiteering as prices spike in part because of Biden’s ban on Russian oil imports.

LIUBLIN: ""I represent maybe a small or maybe not so small, population of Russian people how don't support Russian policy, who don't support Russian President, government and who basically want to kind of repay and bear responsibility for what Russia has done."" The couple arrived in Budapest, Hungary, after a five-day journey. Liublin’s Russian nationality added to the complicated situation. NIKOLAIEVA: ""At first when we met and I knew that he was Russian it was a bit weird but nothing serious however when the war started it was a different story because there was a lot of mistrust from Ukrainian people towards Russians and I was afraid for him that he would not be liked under these circumstances."" It’s still hard for them to relax in the safety of their new city. They shudder at sudden noises and police sirens. LIUBLIN: ""I hope we will be in a safe country where we can build a new life, settle down and wait until this whole craziness is over.""

3/16/2022,"GOTEMBA, Japan (AP) — Japanese and U.S. Marines had their first airborne landing and combat training together on Tuesday near Mt. Fuji as the two allies strengthen military cooperation amid growing maritime activity by China and Russia in the regional seas. Japan has been expanding its defense budget and capability for about a decade and is now revising its key national security strategy in the face of threats from China, North Korea and now Russia. On Tuesday, 400 troops from Japan's Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade and 600 U.S. Marines based on Japan’s southern island of Okinawa jointly practiced landing and combat operations in a scenario of an enemy invasion of a remote Japanese island, using tilt-rotor Ospreys, amphibious armored vehicles and artilleries such as M777. The exercise comes at a time when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has intensified worries about what could happen in East Asia, where China’s growing assertiveness has escalated tension around Taiwan. While Japan has shifted its security focus to the southwest, it also faces Russia’s growing naval activity and its increased cooperation with China. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said the Japanese navy spotted a fleet of six Russian warships Monday passing the Soya Strait between Hokkaido and Sakhalin as part of Russia's major naval exercises, days after another Russian fleet crossed the Tsugaru Strait between Aomori on the northern tip of Japan's main island and Hokkaido. He said Russia also conducted a land-to-air missile firing last week on the Russian-held Kuril islands, which Japan also claims. The dispute over the islands Moscow took at the end of World War II has prevented Japan and Russia from signing a peace treaty. “Russia's military has been escalating abnormal naval drills in areas including the Okhotsk in sync with their invasion of Ukraine,” Matsuno said. “We told Russia we are watching its intensifying military activity with grave concern."" Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has repeatedly pledged to fundamentally strengthen Japan’s defense power, including considering possessing a controversial preemptive strike capability. Japan has purchased American fighter jets, missile defense systems and other arsenals to increase interoperability as the two sides increasingly work together. Tuesday’s drill was part of a three-week joint exercise aimed at advancing interoperability between the allies to strengthen their deterrence and response capability, defense officials said. “We are committed to securing the peace and stability in the region through Japan-U.S. joint responses. Any potential adversary will see this as our actual capability, not just words,” said Col. Masashi Hiraki, commander of Japan's First Amphibious Rapid Deployment Regiment. “Japan, together with the U.S. Marines, have the will and ability to defend the region, and I expect this to provide deterrence."" ""We are operating across all domains to achieve the effects that are required to be successful on today’s battlefield"" seamlessly between the two allies, said Col. Michael Nakonieczny, Commanding Officer of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit based in Okinawa. The Japanese amphibious unit, part of the army and Japan's first marines since World War II, was launched in 2018 to bolster the country's defense in the East China Sea. Japan is particularly concerned about Chinese military activity there in waters surrounding the Japanese-controlled Senkaku islands, which Beijing also claims and calls Diaoyu. Japan has significantly expanded its joint drills with the United States as well as other partners including Australia, India, France, Britain and Germany that also share concern about China’s push for its territorial claims in the region, which has some of the world’s busiest sea lanes. ___ Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.",World/Associated Press,"Japan-US marine combat drills held amid China, Russia worry",https://news.yahoo.com/japan-us-marine-combat-drills-115056494.html
