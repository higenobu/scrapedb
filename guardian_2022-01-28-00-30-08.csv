1/28/2022,"Peers have called for Zac Goldsmith to explain why his office sent an email last August which said Boris Johnson had authorised a controversial airlift of animals from Kabul – when he had previously told the House of Lords this was not the case. Ray Collins, a Labour peer, asked Lord Goldsmith, who was not present, “to return as a matter of urgency to make a statement to the house” to clear up the apparent discrepancy.  A Foreign Office email released on Wednesday showed an official working for Goldsmith, who is a Foreign Office minister, had written to a colleague on 25 August to say “the PM has just authorised” the staff and animals of the Nowzad welfare charity to be cleared for evacuation. But, Collins said, Goldsmith had denied this was the case in the Lords on 7 December: Goldsmith said rebuttals made by Johnson that day were “from my own experience … entirely accurate”. “My lord, only one of these two statements can be true. Which is it?” Collins said on Thursday, arguing that Goldsmith had a duty to explain himself under the ministerial code. “Ministers must correct any inadvertent errors at the earliest opportunity or offer their resignation if they have knowingly misled,” he added. The government minister Nicholas True said Goldsmith had tweeted a statement on Wednesday, in which he said: “I did not authorise and do not support anything that would have put animals’ lives ahead of peoples’…. I never discussed the Nowzad charity or their efforts to evacuate animals with the PM.” Later, Lord True added: “Allegations do not constitute evidence.” Boris Johnson, Downing Street and other ministers have repeatedly denied the prime minister gave his personal permission for a privately funded rescue flight to land in Kabul at the end of August. However, an animal rights campaigner linked to Nowzad, Dominic Dyer, said he believed the prime minister did sanction the rescue. On Thursday, Johnson said “this whole thing is total rhubarb”, and that he was proud of the military’s role in rescuing thousands of people stranded in Kabul after the Taliban’s seizure of Afghanistan’s capital. A day earlier, Labour accused Johnson of lying, following the initial disclosure of the Foreign Office email from Goldsmith’s private office. A second email, sent later on 25 August 25 another Foreign Office official involved with the Kabul airlift, repeated the point. It said: “In light of the PM’s decision earlier today to evacuate the staff of the Nowzad animal charity….” Controversy about the rescue of the former royal marine Pen Farthing and his charity’s cats and dogs, and the involvement of the prime minister, has lingered for months after the previously hostile defence secretary, Ben Wallace, unexpectedly announced that he would allow their evacuation in a tweet sent at 1.33am. There was support from some quarters for allowing the animals to be evacuated, but others said that creating a landing slot for the plane when thousands of Afghans were still desparate to be evacuated amounted to a prioritisation of “pets over people”. Supporters of Nowzad engaged in an intense lobbying effort that Dyer said involved Goldsmith. Dyer also said he sent regular updates to the prime minister’s wife, Carrie Johnson, as the crisis unfolded. Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords, said: “If Lord Goldsmith has made a statement to this house that appears at the face of it to be at odds with the statement in an email from his private office that is now public, can he not come to the Lords to explain? I think that’s a very straightforward request.”",News/Politics,Lords call for Zac Goldsmith to explain Kabul animal airlift email,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/27/lords-call-for-zac-goldsmith-to-explain-kabul-animal-airlift-email
1/28/2022,"The rate at which institutional investors, such as private equity and pension funds, are buying up housing is accelerating in major European cities, driving up house prices, research suggests. The volume of purchases in Europe hit €64bn (£53bn) in 2020, with about €150bn worth of housing stock conservatively estimated to be in the hands of such large investors.  Berlin, with €40bn worth of housing assets in institutional portfolios, double the value found anywhere else in Europe, is at the top of the league table, followed by London, Amsterdam, Paris and Vienna, according to analysis of the Preqin private database of investors, funds and large transactions. The research carried out by Daniela Gabor, professor of economics and macrofinance at the University of the West of England, and Sebastian Kohl at Berlin’s Free University, suggests Europe’s housing has become an increasingly attractive “asset class” for investors in part due to near zero interest rates and an encouraging regulatory framework. European central bank data shows that real estate funds in the Eurozone reached €1tn in 2021, the size of Spain’s GDP, from about €350bn in 2010. Within that, residential assets are said to be an increasingly important part. Between 2012 and 2021, the number of major residential transactions involving institutional investors increased the most in Germany (from 16 to 92), Denmark (two to 13) and the Netherlands (two to 60). The private equity company Blackstone, the world’s largest institutional landlord, manages about $730bn in funds globally, of which $230bn was allocated to real estate in September 2021. Blackstone, which posted record profits in October 2021, owns 65,000 residential units across five European countries. A Blackstone spokesman said the firm believed it played a “positive role in addressing the chronic undersupply of housing across the continent” through “investing hundreds of millions to improve properties for tenants”. He said: “The significant undersupply of housing across the globe is the cause of rental rate increases. “Blackstone owns a tiny fraction of the tens of millions of rental properties in Europe. Given our ownership levels, we have no ability to impact broader rent trends and anyone suggesting that such a small player could influence rental rates is engaging in a wilful misunderstanding of how the market works. “We are proud to be responsible custodians of rental housing and we are committed to our residents, which is why we have implemented programs to help residents facing financial difficulties.” With countries across Europe facing the squeeze due to high rent, property prices and energy costs, the role of institutional landowners in the housing market is nevertheless increasingly becoming a target of public anger. The Irish government sought last year to discourage multiple house purchases by large investors by increasing stamp duty to 10% on the purchase of more than 10 houses. Spain’s leftwing government is seeking to ban the sale of social housing to investment funds and to impose rent controls. The residents of Berlin voted in a referendum last year in favour of a proposal that homes owned by private real estate companies with more than 3,000 housing units should be taken into public ownership. Kim van Sparrentak, a Green MEP, who commissioned the study, said: “This study shows how large investors are playing Monopoly with our homes, focusing only on returns, rather than providing a place to live. “The EU needs to recognise that the housing crisis is not just about building more housing and that it needs to play its role in ensuring affordable housing as a fundamental right. Instead of addressing this problem, EU rules are actually facilitating this trend. We need strict regulations to counter large investors from taking over our housing stock.” The failure of the EU and national governments to properly tax the wealthy is said to be facilitating the transfer of funds to pension funds and insurance companies, whose businesses have, in turn, been boosted by the withdrawal of the welfare state, it is claimed. Low interest rates have encouraged investors to search for yield outside “traditional” assets such as government bonds, and to move into new asset classes, including housing, the report argues. According to Preqin data, more than 4,000 institutional investors, directed about $3.6tn of their $136tn assets to European real estate in August 2021. Of these, 1,325 investors held residential assets in their portfolios. The value of real estate portfolios that include housing was said to be about $2tn.",News/World news,"Large investors drive up house prices in Europe’s cities, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/27/large-investors-drive-up-house-prices-in-europes-cities-study-finds
1/28/2022,"Within life’s never-ending quest for self-improvement, most of us understand there are aspects of ourselves that probably can’t be altered. Introvert or extrovert are tricky categories to switch. Ditto messy or tidy or, in my case, a cyclical combination of the two that entails lurching from one to the other on a reliable one-month swing. The hardest to change, most baked-in characteristic, however – one that depends for its flavour on anxiety, understanding of time, relationship with authority and pure strategic fervour – is whether you are a late or an early person. You can be a mixture of both, depending on context. In my late 20s I went through a phase of turning up to things on the wrong day, something I look back on as a symptom of a short-lived greater disturbance. Generally, I’m reliable – a roughly on-time person depending on whom I’m meeting. The better the friend, the later I’ll let myself be, but only within a five-minute margin. I’m not habitually late and look down on those who are. (I also look down on the habitually early, although I’m crashingly early for things I’m nervous about, and neurotic when it comes to the airport.) I’ve never slept through an alarm or missed a flight. Throughout my kids’ early childhood these parameters held firm, which entailed much screaming on my part before school. We were never, not once, late.One consequence of the early pandemic is supposed to have been an improved ability to differentiate between what matters and what doesn’t. This went deep, drilling down into habits and structures that prior to March 2020 seemed non-negotiable, and tended to be expressed as a wakeup call not to sweat the small stuff. Two years in, however, and it feels to me as if that lesson has been flipped. For a while, we spent a lot of time thinking if we went to a bar, we might die. Then we went to a bar and, if we were lucky, we didn’t die. In fact, nothing happened at all. The kids missed months and months of school, unthinkable in before times, and nothing much happened. I don’t mean there won’t be long-term educational or behavioural consequences, or that different age groups and demographics didn’t suffer differently. Only that in the day to day, for a lot of people there was a gap between the predicted horror of this outcome and the sense of a continuation of daily life, the banal slog of it all somehow surviving dire forecasts. Before the pandemic, a single week of missed school was considered very bad indeed. Now I have two kids in second grade who sat out seven months. They seem fine.Which brings us to lateness. In the New York public school system, if you arrive late, you trigger an automated call to your cell phone that night informing you, robotically, that “your child was late today,” and telling you to send in a note explaining yourself. Prior to the pandemic, we’d never triggered this message. In the last month, I’ve triggered it 17 times. The first day it happened I yelled at my kids all the way to school, forcing an unhappy pace on them and railing about how slow they are in the mornings. But then a strange thing happened: nothing. Nothing happened. The sky didn’t fall in. Nobody died. I started to think about how my kids probably won’t even be in this school system in five years’ time. As long as they aren’t so late as to cause a disruption, what’s the big deal? Very consciously, as if flipping a switch, I decided it didn’t matter.  A whole new world opened up. I encountered, outside the school every day, the Late People. It was like taking up smoking. Every day the same cast of characters, exchanging conspiratorial looks as they ran up the hill. These have never been my people and now suddenly they are, and I don’t understand how it’s possible. There’s an argument that during lockdown something happened to my concept of time; that it became more elastic. I have definitely hit an I-can’t-take-any-more moment, which I’ll have to deal with at some point. Is this Giving Up? Is it, as the popular Katherine May book might have it, “wintering”? At what point does wintering turn into giving up? It’s good to be without anxiety and we all benefit from less shouting, but on the other hand, where does it end? What if I can never drum up adrenaline again? I suspect it won’t last. This week alone we’ve been on time twice. If I’m minded to worry, the concern isn’t the lateness, it’s the not caring. What else, given this experience, might one learn not to care about? Is this a good or a bad thing? Late isn’t a good look, I still believe that. And yet here it is: a small, formerly tightly wound part of myself that in this new mode is quietly rejoicing.

1/28/2022,"Three recent killings in the Los Angeles area have put the spotlight on the disparate impact of American gun violence on Black women and the lack of attention their stories receive, as the country reckons with some of the most intense spates of gun violence in years.  Both killings took place on weekends, a mere two weeks apart. On 8 January, California officials found the body of Tioni Theus, a 16-year-old girl who was found shot at a busy onramp of the 110 freeway. On 23 January, sisters Breahna Stines and Marneysha Hamilton were among four people shot dead during a mass shooting at a birthday party in Inglewood. Neither incident received much coverage outside of local news, raising questions about which stories are elevated in the national spotlight and which mass shootings grasp the country’s attention. While discrepancies between the attention for white victims of violence and Black victims of violence is nothing new, community organizers and researchers worry about the message this phenomenon continues to send to young Black girls about their worth and potential. “This image of a young Black girl on the side of a highway with cars driving by speaks to the invisibility of Black life,” said Nikki Jones, a professor of African American studies at UC Berkeley. “Black girls are contending with the messages that their life is disposable, and that’s an extremely dangerous message.” Theus was born in LA’s Compton neighborhood. Family members described her as loving, caring and smart, and fond of playing golf. Her life was turned upside down when her mother was severely injured in a motorcycle accident and moved into an assisted living facility, they said. On the evening of 7 January, she reportedly told her father she was meeting someone at a party, according to the LA district attorney George Gascón. Hours later, her body was found. Officials said on Wednesday that California highway patrol is continuing its investigation with assistance from Los Angeles police. The Los Angeles district attorney’s office suspects Theus was a victim of sex trafficking, and said court documents identified her as a victim of child sex exploitation. But officials did not announce any suspects or a motive for the killing. Authorities did announce a $110,000 reward for tips that lead to an arrest in the case, a move Theus’s family and Black Los Angeles residents had been asking for for weeks. As attention for Theus’s killing has picked up in recent days, so have comparisons between the reaction to her death to the killing of Brianna Kupfer, a 24-year-old woman stabbed to death in the furniture store where she worked on 13 January. Days after that killing, which garnered nationwide media coverage, police announced a $250,000 reward for information. A suspect was arrested on 19 January. Like Theus’s killing, the mass shooting that claimed the lives of Stines and Hamilton initially received little attention outside of local news outlets and social media. Family members have identified to me the two women who died in the ambush. Breahna Stines (in pink) turned 20 years old today. It was her party. Her 25 year old sister, Marneysha Hamilton, was also killed. Sending love to all those dealing with this loss. @CBSLA @Inglewood_PD pic.twitter.com/3dBIfVjAxX Two sisters, Stines, 20, and Hamilton, 25, were celebrating Stines’s birthday on 23 January when multiple shooters opened fire, killing the pair as well as Teron Whittiker and Jayden Griffin, both 21. Inglewood’s mayor has said the shooting appeared to have been a targeted “ambush” that involved multiple weapons, including a rifle and a handgun. The mayor described the incident as the worst single shooting crime in Inglewood since the 1990s. The next day family members mourned at the scene with flowers and balloons. Yet the incident did not garner the national attention and condolences that other shootings with multiple victims have. Rather than it being a story about senseless gun violence upending lives, it has become a local crime story. “The framing of these stories gives us permission to respond in certain ways,” said Jones on the different ways mass shootings are covered. “There has been a historical investment in the presumed innocence of whiteness and the presumed criminality of Blackness.” Tina Sampay, a freelance journalist who goes by Slauson Girl, and who has been covering Theus’s case and calling for greater attention to her family’s search for justice said: “The differences speak to how we in the inner city are seen as disposable, and when these things happen they’re acceptable because of the environment that they live in. It all just reinforces the negative ideas about the value of their life.” Stines, Hamilton and Theus’s deaths come after more than 18 months of increased homicides across the US, most of them perpetrated with guns. Across the US, homicides increased by 30% between 2019 and 2020, the largest single-year jump in the 60 years the FBI has been tracking such data. In California, homicides increased by 30%, with 523 more homicides in 2020 than the year prior. Black residents, despite comprising 6% of California’s population, made up 31% of the state’s homicide victims. Official homicide data for 2021 is not available yet, but partial data suggests the trends appear to have continued. While most of gun violence victims were Black men, at least four Black women and girls were murdered per day in the US in 2020, according to the FBI data, a sharp increase compared with the year before. Homicides of Black women in California nearly doubled in 2020, with 99 being killed compared with 55 in 2019, according to FBI data analyzed for the Guardian. Los Angeles, where Stines, Hamilton and Theus died, led the state in Black women’s death with 50 of the killings happening in the county. Criminologists are still trying to understand how much of the increase in killings of Black women last year was related to domestic violence, and how much is a part of the rise in community violence since the start of the pandemic. But advocates and scholars say the increase should be followed by efforts to address the factors that have long made Black women face a three times higher homicide rate than white women. “Black women and girls are being murdered and I don’t think anyone is paying attention,” said Lawanda Hawkins, a Los Angeles-based victim rights advocate with Justice For Murdered Children, the organization she founded in 1996. “Tioni was a little girl, and they threw her body out like she was nothing. That cut up my heart,” said Hawkins, who has been a mainstay at vigils for Theus, Stines and Hamilton. Hawkins said she has long implored city officials and police to create a commission that looks specifically at killings and unresolved cases among this demographic. But so far, nothing has materialized. “We need to be sending a message that they’re fighting for these Black girls,” she added. “Right now, Black women and girls see that their lives don’t matter, and we need to let them know that your life as a Black girl matters. We want them to know they can reach for the stars.”",News/US news,LA shooting deaths of two women and girl highlight ‘invisibility of Black life’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/27/los-angeles-killings-black-women-violence
1/28/2022,"A police force is under investigation over its contact with two teenagers whose bodies were found at a beauty spot in Dorset. The male and female, both in their late teens, were discovered by a dog walker in a wooded area beside a reservoir near Bridport. Dorset police said there were no suspicious circumstances but have not said how they died. Their identities have not been revealed but their families have been informed.  A spokesperson said the force had referred itself to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), over the matter. “Dorset police has made a mandatory referral to the IOPC in line with procedures related to the death or serious injury of an individual,” the spokesperson said. One of the reasons a force should refer itself to the IOPC is “if someone had direct or indirect contact with the police when, or shortly before, they were seriously injured or died”, and where “the contact may have caused or contributed to the death or injury”. The incident happened in a secluded spot close to West Bay. Paul Williams, who lives nearby, said: “The whole road was taped off. A dog walker found them. A police community support officer came here yesterday looking for CCTV.” Another man, who wished not to be named, said: “It’s dreadful. Certainly not something you expect to happen on your doorstep.” Ian Bark, the mayor of Bridport, said: “My sympathies go out to the friends and families of these young people. It is very sad to hear that two people who are both so young have died.” The police spokesperson said: “At 10.11am on 25 January we received a report of two people, a girl and a man, both in their late teens, having been found dead at Bothenhampton Reservoir, Wych Hill. Officers attended. There are no suspicious circumstances.

1/28/2022,"Hello, and happy Thursday, On Tuesday afternoon, Jim Cooper, a moderate Democrat who has been in Congress for more than three decades, announced he was retiring. The timing was not a coincidence.  Less than 24 hours earlier, the Tennessee legislature had approved a map with new boundaries for the state’s eight congressional districts. Since 2003, Cooper has represented a district that includes all of Nashville, and it has been reliably Democratic (Joe Biden carried it by 24 points in 2020). But the legislature’s new plan erased his district. Republicans sliced up Nashville into three different districts, attaching a sliver of Democratic voters in each to rural and deeply Republican areas. Donald Trump would have easily won all three of the new districts in 2020. Cooper was blunt in his assessment of what had happened. Republicans, he said in a statement, had made it impossible for him to win re-election to Congress. Despite his best efforts, he said, he could not stop Republicans from “dismembering Nashville”. The map doesn’t just weaken the voice of Democrats, it also dilutes the influence of Black voters and other voters of color in Nashville. In Cooper’s current district, Black voters make up about a quarter of the voting-age population. They will comprise a much smaller share of the voting age population in the new districts, making it harder for them to make their voices heard. Andrew Witherspoon, my colleague on our visuals team, and I put together an interactive map that shows exactly how Republicans transformed Cooper’s district. It’s one of the clearest examples of how politicians can essentially rig elections in their favor just by moving district lines. It underscores how gerrymandering is a remarkably powerful and efficient method of voter suppression – the influence of certain people’s votes matter less before a single ballot is even cast. Tennessee isn’t the only place this is happening. In Kansas, Republican lawmakers are advancing a plan that would similarly crack Kansas City, making it more difficult for the Democrat Sharice Davids, the first Native American woman elected to Congress, to get re-elected. In North Carolina, Republicans cracked the city of Greensboro in order to dismantle the state’s sixth congressional district, currently represented by a Democrat. Democrats have also shown a willingness to engage in this kind of distortion where they have control of the redistricting process, in places such as Illinois, Maryland and probably New York. Democrats will have complete control over drawing 75 congressional districts, compared with 187 for Republicans. The day before he announced his retirement, I spoke with Cooper about why he thought this was happening and what he thought the consequences would be for Nashville voters. What’s happening now is just “raw politics”, Cooper said. “In two previous redistricting cycles, none of the politicians in the state knew that I existed as a candidate. That made it easier – they weren’t trying to get Jim Cooper. And then in cycles where they did know I existed, it was either too difficult to rearrange the counties, or they were gentler,” he told me. Politico reported recently that after Republicans weren’t as aggressive as they could have been in states such as Texas and Georgia, there is some pressure to be even more aggressive in places like Tennessee. The Nashville constituents who are being sliced up into each of the three districts are likely to have much less importance to their new, Republican representatives, Cooper said. Any input they have, “at most, it will be tokenism”. “This is not a majority-minority community, but it will limit the ability for them to be heard. Because they’ll become essentially a rounding error in much larger districts that are dominated by the surrounding towns,” he said. “The center of gravity will shift.” Also worth watching … A federal court told Alabama to redraw its congressional districts after finding Republican lawmakers had discriminated against Black voters. Alabama is appealing the ruling. Arizona Republicans are proposing a suite of new voting restrictions after a widely criticized review of the 2020 election results. Texas continues to face significant problems after implementing sweeping new voting restrictions ahead of its 1 March primary. Ohio Republicans are redrawing state legislative and congressional maps after the state supreme court struck down earlier efforts as unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders. There are still concerns the new state legislative maps are severely gerrymandered.",News/US news,Republicans just wiped out a Democratic district.

1/28/2022,"Asta Nielsen’s career started with a bang. The Danish diva’s first step on the path to becoming perhaps the greatest actress of the silent era, and one of the cinema’s first truly international film stars, was a hot romance and an overnight sensation. In her first film, The Abyss, 1910, she played a music teacher torn between two lovers: a sensible vicar’s son, and a circus performer who treats her terribly but has captivated her sexually. Nielsen delivers a compelling performance as a young woman riven by the conflicting demands of duty and desire, which culminates in the film’s most infamous scene, a lascivious dance. She circles her tyrannous lover, swaying her hips, before taking a rope from around her waist and tying it tightly around her man. As soon as audiences caught their breath, they clamoured for more. Nielsen soon realised that her future lay in the cinema. She was 29 when The Abyss was released, and had been working as a jobbing actor since leaving school, but despite glowing reviews couldn’t land the leading roles of her dreams. The cinema offered opportunities that the stage had failed to provide, and she elevated the new art form to something more sophisticated, more adult, with her radical new performance style. She and the writer-director of The Abyss, Urban Gad, moved to Germany where they made several more films together – and soon married.  Nielsen immediately set herself apart from her peers thanks to her acting technique, which she studied from the rushes: she summoned emotions, nuance by nuance, to her face and with the smallest movements could tell complex stories of passion and loss on camera. In her memoirs, she called it: “The absolute gift of thinking yourself into fragments organised beforehand in your mind, which requires authenticity of expression in front of the all-determining lens.” When she auditioned for drama school as a teenager, she offered a fully silent performance. She was told to return with a more traditional audition piece, but it is telling that her understanding of performance began with physicality, not reciting lines. The Hungarian film critic Béla Belász considered that Nielsen had invented an entirely new language for the screen: “Only when advances in cinematography enable us to assemble our first gesture lexicon will we be in a position to gauge the extent of Asta Nielsen’s thesaurus of gestures.”Nielsen liked to joke that her scripts gave her little material to work from, simply reading, for example: “Baby dies. Asta’s main scene.” That’s almost certainly a rank exaggeration of the facts, but it is true that she brought a lot more technique to her scenarios than many of her peers. For Nielsen, achieving these miniature effects was the essence of making great cinema. Born in 1881, Nielsen didn’t have an easy start, growing up in poverty in Copenhagen and Malmö, Sweden, and giving birth to a daughter out of wedlock when she was 19 and a student at the Royal Danish Theatre drama school. She refused to marry the child’s father, a law student, because marriage would have inhibited her theatrical ambitions. It was a fairly audacious decision for a working-class girl in 1901, but Nielsen was single-minded in matters of love and work. As were the often shockingly headstrong women she loved to play on screen. Her appearance was striking. With a slender, androgynous body and dark features set against pale skin, which she accentuated with her makeup and costumes, she was fascinating to look at. And those large eyes of hers contained pools of deep feeling that hypnotised audiences. She created such a distinct persona on film that it was as if she had been born for the camera. It seems that few people remember Nielsen’s astronomical stardom now, but the BFI Southbank in London is hosting a retrospective of her work in February and March, which will reintroduce this distinctive silent star to the big screen. As a “film-primadonna” (the title of one of her self-reflexive movies), Nielsen went on to make 72 films, continually striving to improve her technique and find material worthy of her efforts, before retiring from the screen in 1932, aged 51, after her first and only talkie. She was a hoot in rip-roaring comedies (such as 1916’s gender experiment The ABC of Love and 1918’s fish-out-of-water romp The Eskimo-Baby) but particularly excelled in heartbreaking tragic roles, in adult melodramas filled with the deep emotion and sexual passion that she conveyed so naturally to the camera. Try her early film Poor Jenny (1912) or her heartbreaking mature work, such as Der Absturz (The Decline, 1923), in which she plays a woman waiting for her lover’s return. Or Dora Brandes (1916), in which she plays a woman shattered by guilt, with shades of Dostoevsky’s novel Raskolnikov. Nielsen was every inch the diva, but her cool androgyny gave all her roles a certain edge of unpredictability, even when she wasn’t playing teenage tomboys in drag. In perhaps her most famous role, she played Hamlet in a feature-length adaptation of Shakespeare’s tragedy in 1921, directed by Svend Gade – but Nielsen’s Prince of Denmark was secretly a princess, disguised as a boy all her life to secure her claim to the throne. It’s a loose interpretation of the play, but Nielsen’s silent soliloquies are as eloquent as any spoken verse reading. As a result, this Hamlet, produced by Nielsen’s own company, has to be seen to be believed. The excitement about Nielsen’s films, and her indelible appearance on screen, made her a megastar, adored by fans from her native Denmark all the way around the world to Australia, and especially in Germany where she spent most of her career – and was hailed as “Die Asta” – The Asta. During the first world war, soldiers in the trenches on both sides pinned up her picture and sent her fan letters. She inspired poets and artists and thrilled the avant garde, while receiving the highest possible acclaim from critics and peers, who considered her mastery of screen acting to be as revolutionary in its own way as Charlie Chaplin’s comedy. Even in the US, where her films were screened less often due to their erotic content and cinema booking systems that didn’t favour imported films, critics marvelled. “She acts. That’s the thing,” enthused the New York Times critic in 1921. “She does not just pose before the camera, nor does she rant and tear around violently. She impersonates a character, she makes it live and have a meaning, a hundred meanings. Her mouth is not simply something to paint a cupid’s bow on. It is an organ to express the thoughts and feelings of the woman within.” Nielsen’s fame may have faded with the passing decades, but one of her younger co-stars gave a sense of her impact on cinema. Greta Garbo said Nielsen taught her everything she knew: “In terms of expression and versatility, I am nothing to her.”  In the Eyes of a Silent Star: The Films of Asta Nielsen is at BFI Southbank from 3 February to 15 March.",Arts/Film,"Asta Nielsen, the silent film star who taught Garbo everything",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/27/asta-nielsen-the-silent-film-star-who-taught-garbo-everything
1/28/2022,"The author of Fight Club has praised the “happy ending” afforded to David Fincher’s film of his book for a new Chinese cut of the movie. Chuck Palahniuk described the change, in which the police successfully foil an anarchist plot and the heroes are incarcerated, as “SUPER wonderful”.Palahniuk told TMZ: “The irony is that … they’ve aligned the ending almost exactly with the ending of the book, as opposed to Fincher’s ending, which was the more spectacular visual ending. So in a way, the Chinese brought the movie back to the book a little bit.”  The conclusion of the 1999 film in its original cut sees Ed Norton’s narrator realise that the character played by Brad Pitt is in fact a projection of his own mind. He then stands on top of a tower block and witnesses the plan overseen by his alter ego to destroy consumerism begin to take effect, as the skyscrapers around him explode. The Chinese version distributed by streaming service Tencent Video instead ends with a caption telling viewers that police uncovered the plot in time and arrested all criminals. The character played by Pitt was put on trial, according to the new edit, before being “sent to a lunatic asylum, receiving psychological treatment. He was discharged from the hospital in 2012.” Palahniuk initially responded to reports detailing the change by saying: “This is SUPER wonderful! Everyone gets a happy ending in China!” He consolidated his thoughts on Substack, calling the incarceration of Pitt’s character: “Amazing. I’d no idea! Justice always wins. Nothing ever exploded. Fini.” He added: “My guess is they also omit the flash of penis at the end. And that they pixelate the dildo in Marla’s room. Crime does not pay!” The news on Wednesday of the re-edit was met with outrage on social media, but Palahniuk said he was already used to his books being changed in some countries, and even banned in some parts of America. “The strange flip side is that in many foreign markets the publisher rewrote the novel so it would end like the film,” he wrote. “Without permission, I might add.” Palahniuk added to TMZ: “What I find really interesting is that my books are heavily banned throughout the US. The Texas prison system refuses to carry my books in their libraries. A lot of public schools and most private schools refuse to carry my books. But it’s only an issue once China changes the end of a movie? I’ve been putting up with book-banning for a long time.”",Arts/Film,Fight Club author praises Chinese cut of film: ‘Super wonderful!’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/27/fight-club-author-chuck-palahniuk-praises-chinese-cut-super-wonderful
1/28/2022,"AHero, a tense, mazy drama from the Iranian writer-director Asghar Farhadi, centers on a figure familiar to anyone who’s attuned to the ebbs and flows of internet celebrity: the social media Main Character, the subject of an internet backlash. Rahim (Amir Jadidi, endearing yet inscrutable), is a man imprisoned for debts in the desert city of Shiraz, who becomes a local hero for an act of charity of ambiguous motivation. His girlfriend Farkhondeh (Sahar Goldoust) found 17 gold coins who she says were left in a purse at a bus stop, but instead of paying toward his freedom, Rahim contacts a bank and arranges a return to their owner. Within days, on furlough from jail, he’s the feelgood story of the moment.  I’ve written before about how there are few films which successfully capture the internet and/or social media without tipping into flat moralism, obsolescence or laughable facsimiles. (Social media and the internet are of course not the same thing, though in today’s climate of platform consolidation, to refer to one is basically to refer to the other, especially in the context of film and television.) This is partly because text phrasing, online references and digital interfaces change so quickly – at a much faster pace than the production of a film, let alone its distribution – that including it in text messages or social media references can jarringly distract from the story at hand; timestamped phone and computer screen risk locking the story into a tight, hyper-specific timeline that can constrain narrative, filming location or cultural references. The few good internet films convey genuine human emotion through depictions of phone-lit characters consumed by the infinite scroll (Eighth Grade, Sweat, Ingrid Goes West) or confined to movement within a desktop (the so-called “screen-life” films produced by Timur Bekmambetov – Profile, Searching and Unfriended – and the 2020 movie Spree). A Hero, available to stream on Amazon, is a rare exception to both of these trends. The two-hour feature is one of the sharpest films about how the online influences our postures off it, evoking a real-time turn of the timeline’s tide, while barely engaging with the internet itself. Farhadi rarely shows a screen, but you can feel the churn of the internet behind Rahim’s rapid celebrity, recorded in heartwarming newspaper articles arranged by his prison, mentions of things seen on social media, and an award from a local charity that collects donations to pay off his debt. And as with anything popular online, there are quickly detractors and doubters. A fellow inmate praises Rahim’s ability to fool everyone with icy contempt. A hiring manager pokes holes in Rahim’s story that he struggles to plug up with evidence. Did he and Farkhondeh really just find gold coins? Who was the skittish woman who collected them, nowhere to be found? Rahim is handsome and ingratiating, a natural charmer, but how much do we trust his story as more reports of his unreliability surface? “I didn’t lie,” he tells his sister Malileh (Maryam Shahdaei), when the deluge of bad optics begins to erase his good fortune. “But you didn’t tell the truth,” she retorts. In Farhadi’s film, as it can be online, both are simultaneously correct and unmoored, swimming in conflicting takes, narratives and hidden motivations. Characters need only reference things seen on social media or “what people are saying” for audiences to fill in the virtual background. The kind of celebratory online attention that Rahim has received and then reaped tends to be corrosive; very, very few things on the internet age well, especially if it goes viral. Popularity engenders backlash, which platforms then amplify. Main characters are revealed to have complicated, maybe unsavory backstories. Pile-ons careen out of control, context or scope. (To cite two prominent examples from just the past two weeks on US social media: the furor over West Elm Caleb and the curdling of Wordle fandom.) Anyone interested in maintaining their two days of fame or parlaying it into something else must participate in an increasingly hollow and cringey game of self-promotion, one even influencers themselves – the ones who make actual money off of producing content on big platforms – appear exhausted with. One can imagine smaller versions of this happening simultaneous to the action in A Hero, which mostly sticks to Rahim’s confused, soured IRL perspective. It’s there in the way charity officials titter about returning their donations, caught in the difficult position of backing a controversy. It’s implied when the daughter of Rahim’s creditor, Nazanin (Sarina Farhadi), whose dowry was spent to cover Rahim’s loans, takes out a phone to film a physical altercation. It haunts scheming by Rahim, Malileh and brother-in-law Hossein (Alireza Jahandideh) to restore Rahim’s reputation. It frames concerns of “authenticity” in the filming of Rahim’s innocent, scared son Siavash (Saleh Karimai), who has a severe speech impediment, as a ploy for sympathy. Farhadi has traced dense thickets of ethics and motivations before, in his two Oscar-winning pictures A Separation and The Salesman, and A Hero applies the same scrupulous vision to characters besieged, directly or adjacently, by the whims of public discourse out of one’s control. When Rahim learns that an unflattering video of him, one that he fought to keep hidden, has been posted online, we do not see the comments, takes, explainers, hate messages. It’s all there on his face, which has the pall of a real death. It’s unclear what he mourns most – his reputation, his ego, any prospect of controlling the narrative, his dignity, possibly his freedom from debtor’s prison. A Hero is one of the best films on social media by playing on what we already know, refracting familiar, repetitive dynamics into a taut psychological drama that muddies the internet’s preferred lines of good and bad. You do not have to see the explosion or know its real cause to understand the fallout. Social media waves rise and fall, crest and repeat, forgotten in a day but leaving real wreckage behind. We know that but tend to forget it – behind all of these screens are fragile, complicated humans. A Hero puts that truth first, offering a model for future internet-adjacent films to come.",Arts/Film,How Oscar-tipped Iranian drama A Hero nails social media fallout,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/27/how-oscar-tipped-iranian-drama-a-hero-nails-social-media-fallout
1/28/2022,"You have to tread carefully when it comes to the Beach Boys’ late-70s albums: patchy is putting it mildly. But Baby Blue – a refugee from Dennis Wilson’s unfinished second solo album, Bamboo, parachuted on to the largely awful LA (Light Album) – is fantastic: fragile, ethereal, alternately romantic and pained.  An overlooked anomaly amid the Surfin’ USA album’s twangy instrumentals and paeans to catching a wave, The Lonely Sea is slow, shimmering and eerie. It makes the sea sound faintly sinister – a reminder of life’s transience – rather than a source of fun, its dreamy ache a sign of where Brian Wilson was headed. Bruce Johnston’s songwriting could tend to schmaltz: see the ghastly Deirdre, from Sunflower. But the gentle, descending melody on his contribution to Surf’s Up – an evocation of 50s America that couldn’t have been less fashionable in 1971, decorated with wah-wah guitar or not – is disarmingly charming. LSD didn’t make Brian Wilson relax and float downstream: it scared the shit out of him. You can hear the fear in Smile’s supine, compelling but distinctly creepy Wind Chimes. It’s creepier and more compelling still in the ragged re-recording on Smiley Smile, and nothing like anything else the Beach Boys recorded. Brian and brother Carl had a row in the studio over Brian’s insistence that Little Honda needed a distorted guitar. Brian won, and the result was as close as the Beach Boys came to garage-rock toughness: nothing to scare the Shadows of Knight, but its vague hint of pounding aggression is really thrilling. The Beach Boys seldom rocked out convincingly – it just wasn’t their forte – which makes It’s About Time, a collaborative effort involving Dennis and Carl Wilson and Al Jardine, a truly rare pleasure: Dennis’s vocal is raw and powerful, the guitar solo stings, the Santana-inspired Latin percussion rattles along. He’s an understandably controversial figure among Beach Boys fans, but Mike Love nevertheless makes Be True to Your School as exciting as it is: his lyrics are weirdly belligerent, and he sings them with a punkish snarl at odds with its perky cheerleader chants and ra-ra backing vocals, as if intent on provoking a punch-up rather than lauding his alma mater. Wendy was intended as a homage to the Beach Boys’ east coast competitors the Four Seasons: you can definitely hear the influence of their then-current hit single Ronnie, particularly in its intro. But the Four Seasons’ overcast Newark toughness is replaced by dreamy melancholy that feels sunlit even as it ponders a future that looks “awful dim”. The overlooked Carl and the Passions – So Tough feels distantly related to 1965’s Beach Boys Today! Both albums feature a second side consumed by ballads, but here they’re darker, wearier, the sound of a band horribly bruised by the excesses of the late 60s. The highpoint is the wonderful Cuddle Up: Dennis in gorgeous battered romantic mode. For a man supposedly hopelessly square – his LA hipster friends tended to snigger behind his back at his terrible taste – Brian was a serious risk-taker: Help Me, Rhonda’s original version spends its final minute inexplicably fading in and out. Even without that coda, the single version is great: the lyrical misery at odds with the melody. That’s Why God Made the Radio is deeply uneven, but the final track on what’s likely to be the final Beach Boys album is a perfect way of bidding farewell. Based around a keyboard figure that recalls the intro to California Girls, it repurposes Brian’s trademark melancholy. The tune is one of Brian’s more simplistic, and the lyrics are effectively someone wanging on about their car like a bore in the pub on a Sunday lunchtime – you get everything from the clutch to its registration documents. The end result is 1:44 of life-affirming joy, such were the Beach Boys’ mysterious alchemical powers in 1963. 20:20, released in 1969, variously featured old outtakes, covers, a recording of Dennis having sex and – uh-oh – the songwriting talents of Charles Manson. Among the former category lurked Time to Get Alone: a Brian song longing for escape, “safe from the people”, airily delightful, blessed with a heavenly sigh of a chorus. Dennis emerged as a major songwriting force with Sunflower’s Forever, but 4th of July is even better: an epic, deeply troubled meditation on Vietnam utterly at odds with the Beach Boys’ old image as America’s Band. “Band politics” got it elbowed from Surf’s Up – it remained unreleased until 1993. It says something about the company it kept that Dance, Dance, Dance feels undervalued among the Beach Boys’ run of classic singles. Carl’s riff is great, its 12-string guitar and frantic solo bear the influence of the Beatles’ A Hard Day’s Night, but the sudden key change midway through the third verse is pure Brian. Its writing apparently fuelled by the assassination of President John F Kennedy, The Warmth of the Sun is extraordinarily luscious and incredibly sad. It’s also a perfect example of the subtly increasing richness of Brian’s writing: no one else in pop in 1964 was writing chord sequences and melodies like this. The Beach Boys were in trouble by the time of Wild Honey’s December 1967 release: Brian’s mental health had collapsed, tastemakers were deriding them as unhip. You wouldn’t know from Darlin’, a heart-swelling triumph with a great Carl vocal: in its own way, its pared-back R&B-infused sound fitted the rootsy post-psychedelic mood. The most angelically voiced Beach Boy of all, Carl was a late developing, sporadic and patchy songwriter, but Feel Flows was a total delight, a hazily psychedelic take on laid-back 70s west coast rock with a fantastic, surprisingly stinging guitar solo. Its use in Almost Famous deservedly brought it to a wider audience. Legend has it that Brian wrote This Whole World while “stoned and confused”, which seems remarkable given the song’s plethora of changes and its mood of spiralling elation. Its a cappella coda – Carl’s falsetto soaring over a wall of backing vocals – is as spine-tingling as anything in the Beach Boys’ catalogue. Pet Sounds is so consistently fantastic that picking its highlights swiftly becomes about personal preference. Is I’m Waiting For the Day “better” than I Guess I Just Wasn’t Made For These Times or Here Today? Not really, but the point at 0:52 when the drums kick in might be the album’s most exciting, exuberant moment. A wonderful song and another signpost to Pet Sounds that stirs the influence of Burt Bacharach into a saga of heartbreak and optimism. The writing and arrangements are ever-more ornate, but the real genius of Brian might not be all the musical twists and turns but how effortless the finished product feels. The demo of Sail On Sailor features Brian pleading with co-writer Van Dyke Parks to “convince me that I’m not insane”. That such an optimistic, joy-bringing song came out of such turmoil seems almost beyond belief: the lyrics might feel like Parks’s message to his troubled partner, but Brian’s strident, punchy music matches it. Fun, Fun, Fun must have sounded like a description of another planet in early 60s Britain: a world of drive-in restaurants and unimaginable plenty, where a teenager could take possession of a Ford Thunderbird. No wonder it sounded so exuberant, from its Chuck Berry guitar intro to its final, life-affirming explosion of harmonies. Invariably overshadowed by its successor Surf’s Up, Sunflower is the real jewel in the Beach Boys’ 70s catalogue: more of a band effort than Pet Sounds, packed with amazing songs, not least All I Wanna Do, a blissful, reverb-drenched dream that some have claimed as a precursor to chillwave. A little bafflingly, Brian later called it “boring”. One of the fastest learners in pop, Brian described 1962’s Surfin’ Safari as merely “a rehearsal”. The qualitative leap on the Chuck Berry-indebted Surfin’ USA – released a mere five months later – feels mind-blowing. It’s tighter, smoother, shinier, more exciting: a song entirely of its moment, but so infectiously gleeful as to defy time. The projected follow-up to Good Vibrations pushed Brian’s fragmentary writing technique to its limit. Disjointed in a way its predecessor simply wasn’t, it’s still an incredible achievement, unlike anything else in pop then or now. What audiences in 1967 would have made of the five-minute version, belatedly released in 2011, is anyone’s guess. Hymning the early 60s before the 60s were over, Do It Again helped usher in a retrospective mood in US pop culture, harking back to a mythic prelapsarian era just as American Graffiti and Don McLean’s American Pie would subsequently do. It’s also a fantastic song: the lead vocal-free middle section is particularly thrilling. The greatest and most moving of the Beach Boys’ initial ventures into introspection. With its worries, fears and crying in the dark, In My Room seems astonishingly vulnerable for a male pop band in 1963: an early sign that all was not as it seemed behind the sunny California facade. Spare a thought for Love, the naysaying villain in the saga of Smile going unfinished: who wouldn’t be a little shocked by Cabinessence? But if you’re not a 60s pop star looking for a hit, it sounds glorious and ambitious: drawing on folk music, cowboy songs and Aaron Copland, alternately funny, touching and disturbing. A strong candidate for the title of the most beautiful song the Beach Boys ever recorded, Don’t Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)’s sumptuous, string-laden yearning stands out even on Pet Sounds. Analyse its harmonic complexities, diminished chords and passing tones if you want: however Brian did it, it’s impossible not to succumb to. Side two of Beach Boys Today! offered a succession of dazzling, plush ballads that bore testament to Brian’s increasing fondness for marijuana and acted as a dry run for Pet Sounds. Every one of them is amazing, but the subtly arranged, swooning beauty of Please Let Me Wonder is something else. Perhaps the finest expression of swaggering youthful arrogance in pop history – “we’ve never missed yet with the girls we meet” – I Get Around manages to be impossibly pleased with itself and totally irresistible: the astonishing harmonies, Brian’s vaulting falsetto, the key change midway through, the fabulous pizzicato guitar on the verses. In recent years, God Only Knows seems to have become the definitive Beach Boys song: you’re far more likely to hear it on the radio than I Get Around. Its resulting over-familiarity notwithstanding, its plaintive loveliness – amplified by Carl’s vocal – can still take your breath away in an unguarded moment. The contrasting personalities at the Beach Boys’ centre in one stunning pop package. Love’s lyrics pay swaggering tribute to the sun-kissed ladies of the band’s home state, equal parts lechery and we’re-the-best cheerleading. Brian’s astonishing instrumental introduction, however, seems beamed from a very different world: reflective, autumnal, suffused with sadness. Pet Sounds’ clarion call features Brian throwing everything at the wall – tempo shifts, risky key changes (the first arrives six seconds in), instruments rendered unrecognisable by his studio techniques, harmonies so beautiful and tricky they reduced Carl to tears in the studio – and finding it all sticks: an incredible song. One of the greatest B-sides ever released, Don’t Worry Baby has it all: an exquisite melody made more exquisite still by Brian’s tender vocal, a lush backdrop of harmonies, a moving lyric about teen romance and an ill-considered drag race that seems to reflect Brian’s own troubles and insecurities. A stunning piece of songwriting – check out the extended alternative mix on 1998’s Endless Harmony – ’Til I Die is the most emotionally desolate song in the Beach Boys’ catalogue: a howl of resigned despair from a man in terrible distress. Its hopelessness is chilling, its sonic richness cosseting: an incredibly potent, unsettling combination. Almost anything from Pet Sounds could hold this position in the chart, but for sheer emotional power, it’s hard to beat Caroline, No’s meditation on innocence lost, which could just as easily be about a child as an old flame. The music is sumptuously sad; the final, agonised note of Brian’s vocal heartbreaking. The first time the public heard Surf’s Up, four years before it appeared on the eponymous album, it was being lavished with praise: “Too complex to get all of first time around … poetic, beautiful,” gushed the 1967 documentary Inside Pop, superlatives that horrified Brian. But it deserves them: elliptical, deeply haunting and elegiac, it seems to anticipate the waning of the 60s even at their height. In the new documentary Long Promised Road, Don Was attempts to explain Brian’s production techniques by playing his old multi-tracks. It doesn’t work: “I don’t know how he did that,” shrugs Was, baffled. Good Vibrations is testament to those inexplicable powers. An act of unprecedented audacity, it was spliced together from fragments recorded in four different studios. But it doesn’t sound like an avant-garde experiment: it sounds like a breathtaking pop single, its endless shifts and changes coalescing into a perfectly formed, unbelievably thrilling whole. The greatest single ever? Maybe. The pinnacle of 60s pop’s invention and daring? Probably. The Beach Boys’ crowning achievement? Absolutely.  Long Promised Road is in cinemas now.",Arts/Music,The Beach Boys’ 40 greatest songs – ranked!,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/27/the-beach-boys-40-greatest-songs-ranked
1/28/2022,"As the hollering frontman of Pixies, Black Francis has long been one of the best and most instantly recognisable voices in rock – and as the band release an expansive new live album, he will answer your questions about his life and career. Also known by his other stage name Frank Black, Charles Thompson IV was raised by an itinerant and religious family, insulated from the wildness of punk and other 1970s innovations – his musical diet mostly consisted of Christian music and pop oldies.  But after meeting guitarist Joey Santiago at university in Massachusetts, his purview opened up, and in 1986 the pair formed what would be one of the truly great alt-rock bands. With Kim Deal on bass, David Lovering on drums and university degree discarded, Pixies debuted with the Come on Pilgrim mini-album the following year – and Francis’s voice, sweetly cooing and angrily howling often in the space of a single verse, set them apart. Melody was there from the start – listen to the jolly Santiago line on The Holiday Song – but the poppy quality of the songs, almost all of them written solely by Francis, kept ratcheting up. Here Comes Your Man, Debaser, Velouria, Dig for Fire, Monkey Gone to Heaven, Wave of Mutilation – these all had the sweetest of tunes even if the subject matter was phantasmagoric, and all became indie-disco classics. Francis and Deal had an infamously irritable bandmate relationship, which prompted a hiatus after major label breakthrough Doolittle, and was a factor in the eventual breakup of the band in 1993. Francis released a more than a dozen acclaimed solo albums, including with new backing band the Catholics, before Pixies reformed in 2004 – that return is the subject of a new box set, documenting four Brixton Academy concerts across 16 sides of vinyl. Their fanbase had stayed with them, and new ones had been added – Where Is My Mind? helped to earn them a new audience after it iconically soundtracked the bleak ending of Fight Club – allowing them to consistently tour ever since. Deal left at the outset of sessions for their recorded comeback, 2014 album Indie Cindy, but Pixies have endured – they will start touring again post-pandemic, including with a headline slot at this year’s End of the Road festival. It’s a bumpy but consistently creative journey for Black Francis, who will answer questions right across it. Post them in the comments below before the end of 31 January, and his answers will be published in the 4 February edition of the Guardian’s Film & Music section, as well as online.",Arts/Music,Post your questions for Pixies frontman Black Francis,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/27/post-your-questions-for-pixies-frontman-black-francis
1/28/2022,"Boris Johnson has decided that one of his key routes to survival is to persuade his backbenchers that Labour want him gone. But if Labour MPs had a vote in the secret ballot in the vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson, there are some who might pause with their pencil. The overwhelming emotion among them is relief – mainly not to be the ones in the spotlight whose party is riven with internal division. Had things taken a different course since September, it is not difficult to imagine Labour being the ones considering Keir Starmer’s future.  But there is disagreement as Labour MPs chew over the possible worlds that could emerge in the coming weeks. Labour has raced ahead in the polls as partygate dominates the headlines and MPs’ inboxes fill with angry complaints from voters. Much of that is directly at the feet of Johnson, and his possible successors – Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Sajid Javid – are not yet tainted. Many pondering the data in Labour HQ say it is too early to fully understand the public mood. Starmer’s own ratings have been rising, as well as metrics that party chiefs watch closely, including how Labour is trusted on the economy. But there is also a sense that the Conservatives’ own lead was vastly inflated by a vaccine bounce and that the polls are likely to even out within the next few months and settle into a more predictable pattern that might be expected at this point for a government mid-term. Some of those advising Starmer quietly say there might be some electoral merit to a wounded prime minister limping on, especially one who narrowly wins a no confidence vote. Preoccupied by restive and rebellious backbenchers, neutered by his chancellor in terms of domestic policies and with no political capital to make major changes, Johnson could quickly become a lame duck prime minister in the eyes of the public. Plus, they argue, the longer Johnson goes on, the further the Conservative brand is tarnished, his MPs making laughable statements of support about cake ambushes. Starmer, they argue, is the perfect counterweight to Johnson – with a serious, slightly boring demeanour, with a lifetime of public service. One shadow minister, mulling over what timing would suit them, said a departure after the local elections might be the most beneficial to the party. “Not only do they lose seats, but then the Tories look even more self-serving, they only ditched him not for moral reasons but for poor results. And then there is the wider good that the country gets rid of him too.” Starmer himself would never suggest it was better for Johnson to continue. His team decided it was inconceivable they could not call for Johnson’s resignation two weeks ago at PMQs. Any more calls for inquiries, explanations, apologies would obviously not wash. “There’s always an argument that once you’ve gone that far, there’s nowhere to go, it’s sixth gear. But the email [from Martin Reynolds inviting staff to a party] meant we took that choice. Anything less would look pathetic.” But ask any of the party’s northern MPs with experience of fighting battles in the red wall and many will say Labour’s chances are enhanced with Johnson gone. It is the message Johnson is drilling into his backbenchers. “Of course he wants me out of the way,” he told PMQs. “He does, and – I will not deny it – for all sorts of reasons, many people may want me out of the way, but the reason he wants me out of the way is that he knows that this government can be trusted to deliver, and we did.” Some will privately agree with that, having observed Johnson take selfies on the streets in a way few others could. “I think in the long run we don’t want to take the chance he can recover,” one said. Another said Sunak or Truss would be far less likely to keep lots of the seats that Johnson had taken – or may yet win. “I don’t know if that’s what the polls say or not, but my instinct is he still has some personal appeal and my voters just don’t know who Liz Truss is.”",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson must resign now, says Starmer – but does he mean it?",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/27/boris-johnson-must-resign-now-says-starmer-but-does-he-mean-it-labour
1/28/2022,"That sound you hear is Democrats in Washington and across the country letting out a sigh of profound relief: Associate Justice Stephen Breyer is retiring in June, at the end of the US supreme court’s current term. News of the 83-year-old’s choice to step down broke on Wednesday – evidently a little earlier than the man himself would have liked – giving President Biden his first opportunity to fill a vacancy on the nation’s highest court. The decision from Breyer ends months of speculation and a determined pressure campaign to convince the ageing liberal justice to retire while Democrats still held both the White House and the Senate, that rare and precarious circumstance that is now required for any Democratic president to see his federal court nominees confirmed. Breyer’s decision to step down this summer gives the Democrats a narrow window to appoint his replacement before they are expected to lose control of the Senate in the November midterms.  Breyer’s retirement, after nearly 30 years as a justice, will not change the balance of power on the supreme court, which has heaved dramatically rightward since Justice Anthony Kennedy chose to retire under Donald Trump in 2018. Nor will his exit mitigate what are likely to be ruinous outcomes in this term’s major rulings, which include the hateful Dobbs v Jackson, the case that is almost certain to overturn Roe v Wade. The benefits of his timely exit aren’t so much ameliorative as preventive: because he has retired under a Democratic trifecta, he has ensured that the supreme court’s conservative 6-3 supermajority will at least stay 6-3, and not become and insurmountable 7-2. But the extremist makeup of an increasingly maximalist rightwing court will continue. What his retirement does bring to an end is a long legal and political career of the kind that has since become unfeasible. Breyer’s early career was marked by the industrious bipartisanship of the latter 20th century, and he helped shape that era’s neoliberal consensus. When he was young, Breyer was a legal academic at Harvard – read any biography of a federal courts judge and the words “legal academic at Harvard” are likely to appear –and he wrote inventively about the prerogatives of executive agencies, a field known as administrative law. He favored deregulation, and took several leaves of absence from teaching throughout the 1970s to work as a special counsel to Democrats in the US Senate; among his accomplishments there was shepherding the deregulation of the airline industry. He gained a reputation for friendliness and a willingness to negotiate, and as this was in keeping with the social norms of Washington at the time, he was close with a number of Republicans. His children played with the children of the segregationist Republican senator Strom Thurmond. This closeness with men on the other side of the aisle paid off: when President Clinton nominated Breyer to the supreme court in 1994, he was confirmed 87 to 9. On the court itself, Breyer exerted his influence primarily in conference, attempting to extract compromises from his conservative colleagues and to cultivate their more moderate impulses. His colleagues on the left, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and later Sonia Sotomayor, took up the role first crafted by Thurgood Marshall, and wrote passionate dissents to conservative rulings that were meant to sway the public as much as the legal community. This was not Breyer’s style; he was nearly always speaking to other lawyers, not to lay people. We don’t know how much this worked – the justice’s conferences are confidential – but it is entirely possible that as the court shifted right over the course of his tenure, it was Breyer whose private arguments helped slow its lurch. But as the court and the nation became more polarized, Breyer had come to seem out of place. His commitment to persuasion was no match for a 6-3 court packed with conservative ideologues; his passionate belief in legislative power did not fit with the realities of a deadlocked and dysfunctional Congress that increasingly delegated policymaking power to the judiciary. His questions – always famous for their long-windedness and convoluted structure – devolved into meandering soliloquies, and on the audio broadcasts of the court’s oral arguments, his liberal colleagues Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor could often be heard trying to nudge him towards conclusion or clarify his point. It was obvious that he was from another time, and that time has now ended. The best thing he could have done for the country was go, and it is to his credit that he did. What comes next? On the campaign trail, candidate Biden promised to appoint a Black woman to the court, and the likeliest candidate is Ketanji Brown Jackson, a former Breyer clerk who has the justice’s blessing and whose promotion to the DC circuit court of appeals last June was seen as a stepping stone to succeed her former boss. She is 51, and could serve on the court for decades. But, if she is appointed, the institution that awaits Judge Brown Jackson is less collegial and less dignified than the one that welcomed Breyer. Despite the increasingly laughable protestations of its conservative wing, the supreme court has become an all but nakedly political body, frequently warping the law in bizarre and inventive ways to ensure outcomes that align with Republican priorities. They are going to dispose of abortion rights this year. Affirmative action is set to be dismantled. Voting rights have already been shockingly eroded, and the conservatives seem intent on interpreting religious freedom rights for Christians in whichever way can secure the maximum injury and indignity for everybody else. Increasingly, the impression left by the justices themselves is one of vain and petty figures, fixated on their own PR, attempting to maintain the solemn mystique of an institution that has long since lost it. Who would want to join such a workplace? Perhaps Judge Brown Jackson, if she does indeed become the nominee, deserves not only our congratulations, but also our condolences.
