1/16/2022,"The publication of the Sue Gray report into “partygate” is expected to be followed by a clearout of some key officials from Downing Street, a plan reportedly referred to by the prime minister as “Operation Save Big Dog”. Oliver Dowden, the Conservative party co-chair, in effect confirmed this on Sunday when he said that there was a need for a “change of culture” in the building. Many Tory MPs believe that Boris Johnson himself is the person who most needs to go, but he hopes that if others take the blame, he might be able to draw a line under the affair. Here are some of the officials most at risk.  As Johnson’s principal private secretary (PPS), Reynolds is the civil servant with most influence over the prime minister’s day-to-day decision-making. (It’s the Bernard role from Yes Minister.) A career Foreign Office official, Reynolds did the same job for Johnson when he was foreign secretary before becoming ambassador to Libya. He is in the line of fire particularly for sending the email inviting staff to the “BYOB” party in the No 10 garden on 20 May 2020. A former Treasury official who serves as deputy PPS, Glassborow is also in line to leave alongside Reynolds, according to some reports, as part of a planned overhaul of the private office. A former PPS at the Treasury, who worked for Alistair Darling and George Osborne, Rosenfield left the civil service for investment banking but was lured back to Downing Street in late 2020 to be chief of staff, filling the gap left by the departure of Dominic Cummings and Eddie Lister. Since then he has been the subject of negative briefing from colleagues who find his manner imperious, and he has failed to curb Johnson’s chaotic tendencies. He is blamed for approving the claim that no parties were held at No 10. A former Daily Mail journalist, Doyle started working for Johnson in Downing Street in 2020 and he took over as director of communications last year, following the departure of Lee Cain and then James Slack. Many of the reports about the drinking culture at No 10 have centred on the press office, where a wine cooler was reportedly installed to facilitate “wine-time Fridays”, and last month it was claimed Doyle had offered to resign after ITV revealed he had given a speech at a lockdown-busting Christmas party on 18 December 2020. At the time No 10 said the prime minister still had full confidence in Doyle.",News/Politics,‘Operation Save Big Dog’: who is in the line of fire at No 10?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/16/operation-save-big-dog-who-is-in-line-of-fire-no-10-boris-johnson-partygate
1/16/2022,"It’s a question being asked with increasing urgency by intelligence services, multinational companies and most citizens of Kazakhstan: where is Nursultan Nazarbayev? Kazakhstan’s leader from 1991 until 2019, Nazarbayev has long been the arbiter of all business and political decisions in the central Asian nation, and the purveyor of an all-encompassing personality cult. In 2019, he handpicked a successor, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, while retaining power behind the scenes. The capital city, along with its airport and main university were all renamed after him.  But since the worst unrest since independence broke out earlier this month, Nazarbayev has been silent and absent from public view. Official figures say 225 people died in the unrest and subsequent crackdown. Meanwhile, the man who personified Kazakhstan for so long has simply disappeared. Some said he was hiding out on the shores of Lake Geneva. Others suspected he had fled to Dubai. A few whispered conspiratorially that he may be dead. In fact, according to a number of sources, he remains in Kazakhstan, probably in the capital Nur-Sultan, the city that bears his name. “My best information as of today is that Nazarbayev is alive, and furious negotiations are underway with Tokayev about the redistribution of assets, spoils and rents,” said a former western government official, who is well connected in Kazakhstan. Tokayev, once a loyalist, has used the crackdown to strip power from his former benefactor and members of Nazarbayev’s family, some of whom are accused of using the protest mood in the country to unseat Tokayev and seize power. “The power struggle continues. There is no guarantee things will end smoothly,” the former western official said. Yermukhamet Yertysbayev, a former minister and Nazarbayev adviser, also said he believed his former boss was in the country. “Negotiations are ongoing, but it is clear the Nazarbayev era is over,” said Yertysbayev, adding that he blamed the recent violence on “reactionary and conservative forces from the Nazarbayev clan”. While Tokayev has not criticised the former leader by name, there are signs that the personality cult is over. A statue toppled during the riots has not been repaired; street signs for Nazarbayev Avenue that were pulled down in Almaty, the country’s largest city, have not been reaffixed. Authorities have arrested the former head of the security services, Nazarbayev loyalist Karim Masimov, on charges of attempting to seize power. On Saturday, it was announced that two of Nazarbayev’s son-in-laws had been fired from their positions in key state companies. Other relatives are known to have fled the country. Many in the elite are now rushing to declare their loyalty to Tokayev, said one well-connected business source, adding that any purge would hopefully be limited to those in Nazarbayev’s family and inner circle. “Tokayev is a sensible guy and he knows how important the image of the country is. He will act smoothly and carefully. He will not spray bullets with a machine gun, he will pick people off accurately with a sniper rifle.” After the 2019 transition, it seemed that Nazarbayev’s official status as “Leader of the Nation”, and his role as head of the powerful security council, would ensure his safety and revered status were guaranteed. Instead, the image that took 30 years to build has crumbled in the space of a few days. “Many people are moving from the Nazarbayev camp to the side of President Tokayev,” said Yertysbayev, who appeared to be engaged in exactly that manoeuvre himself, airing thoughts that would have been suicidal to utter publicly just a few weeks ago. “I think Nazarbayev didn’t watch the great film of Francis Ford Coppola The Godfather attentively enough,” said Yertysbayev. “There is no doubt that he is the father and founder of the Kazakh independent state, but he’s a living person and he has his minuses. And the biggest is his sentimental love for his family and clan. I think it’s unacceptable for a head of state.” The pervasion of Nazarbayev family members and their associates through state companies and various money-making enterprises was something that others in the elite found grating, and is one reason why supposedly loyal figures have been willing to change their tune so quickly. The spectacle is likely to prove instructive for other autocrats in the region, notably the Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, both of whom were rumoured to be considering the “Nazarbayev option” as a transition scenario. Putin, whose current term expires in 2024, recently signed a law that would enable him to remain president until 2036, but analysts had also touted a Nazarbayev-like “father of the nation” role, that would allow him a safe and prosperous retirement from frontline politics while retaining ultimate control. Suddenly, that looks a less secure option. Putin has thrown his weight behind Tokayev, offering him the military support of a Russia-led alliance to help regain control. It is likely that he made this support contingent on a safety guarantee for Nazarbayev. However, Putin will also have noted the speed at which Nazarbayev’s supposed devoted supporters deserted the former leader. “It will be used as an argument that no transition is possible, other than a transition from the current president to himself,” said Ekaterina Schulmann, a Moscow-based political scientist. In Kazakhstan, people are waiting to see whether Nazarbayev will ever appear publicly again, and whether Tokayev will fully disown his predecessor, resurrect the personality cult or simply remain silent. “We’ve had lots of small signals, but we are still waiting for the big one,” said Vyacheslav Abramov, the editor in chief of the vlast.kz news website.",News/World news,Where is Kazakhstan’s former longtime leader Nursultan Nazarbayev?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/16/where-is-kazakhstans-former-longtime-leader-nursultan-nazarbayev
1/16/2022,"In the days when I took small children on resort holidays, I’d make a point of reading at least one of the novels on the bookshelves. Some of them were terrible: frowsty clogs-and-shawls sagas, saucy doctors and nurses fantasies and oh so many dogeared Dan Browns. But that’s how I got to know about Danielle Steele, Marian Keyes and Julia Quinn, to name just three. And guess what? They’re still there, hugging the top of the sales charts, and helping to drive a 20% increase in fiction sales over the pandemic year. By far the biggest rise was in “romantic fiction and sagas”, sales of which leapt by 49% to nearly 6m. Even though that’s only a third of the number of “crime, thriller and adventure” novels devoured over the year, it adds up to a lot of fluttering hearts. And, given that in literary rather than sales terms, “romance and sagas” is another way of saying women’s fiction, while crime, thrillers and adventure are three genres with universal appeal, rather than just finding their readers from one half of the population, those figures seem all the more astonishing. So what is going on?  The sales blurb for the latest from Marian Keyes points succinctly to one answer: “Fed up of being a grownup? Get away from it all …” However, the Irish author has long been promoted out of the generic ghetto of genre fiction as a National Treasure, and her novels have never been simple exercises in escapism. The best known of them, Rachel’s Holiday, threw serious drug addiction in the way of its happy ending. I discovered it in Corfu in the early 2000s and secretly enjoyed it rather more than the novel I’d brought with me – Yann Martel’s Life of Pi, which would go on to win the Booker. I’ll definitely be reading Keyes’s sequel, which is due out next month. On the other hand, I’d completely forgotten about the American romance author Julia Quinn until the series based on her books, Bridgerton, popped up on the TV. But yes, I was seduced by the dazzling Regency confection of The Duke and I – one in the series – during an unseasonably wet break, also in the early 2000s when one or other of us kept having to take to bed. The forgettability of romantic fiction is part of the point: it’s like a holiday romance with no strings attached, or the fleeting treat of newspaper-wrapped fish and chips on the pier with the sunlight on your back. And sometimes that’s just what every reader needs. Interestingly, the only two fiction categories that declined in value to publishers during the year were “short stories and anthologies” and “horror and ghost stories”. It may be that the previous year’s sales were bolstered by a handful of high-sellers, but my unscientific take is that the former are too much like work, while – frankly, in this of all years – who needs more horror? We have, though, needed books to read in bed. Though I’ve never been a fan of Mills & Boon (a publisher that has become a genre all of its own), I can see the appeal of its fanciful capers of bounty hunters and fugitive billionaires when lockdown has driven you back under your duvet and your fantasies are constrained by living in a household of bored and depressed others. Mills & Boon efficiently parcels its romance into six categories: modern, medical, historical, heroes, true love and desire. And even before the pandemic, a Mills & Boon novel was said to be sold every 10 seconds somewhere in the world. Undoubtedly, more prosaic issues have also contributed to this boom, not least that the bestsellers are sold through supermarkets, which remained open, while all else was forced to close. With fewer things to distract them, and fewer ways to spend their money, perhaps the British buying public turned to what was literally on the shelf in front of them. But there’s a serious point here about the place of books in popular culture. A wise colleague of mine once said, if the book was invented today it would be hailed as a piece of technological genius. It’s cheap, fits in a bag, doesn’t run out of battery and can easily be passed from hand to hand. It’s also surprisingly indestructible. Fun fact: there are still as many as 2m individual medieval manuscripts in existence – although I don’t know whether the mass-produced pulp airport novel would endure so long. Time will tell.

1/16/2022,"The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has said he was not breaching the rules in a photograph of him drinking a beer with staff in a constituency office last year, and that there was “no comparison” with the prime minister’s recent conduct. The image, captured through the window of a building in Durham in the run up to last year’s Hartlepool byelection, shows Starmer drinking a bottle of beer and standing close to two people, while another two people can be seen in the background.  It was first published last spring, when indoor mixing between different households was not allowed except for work, but the picture has been republished by some media in the wake of a slew of revelations about rule-breaking parties at No 10. Appearing on the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme, Starmer said: “I was in a constituency office just days before the election. We were very busy. We were working in the office. “We stopped for something to eat and then we carried on working. No party, no breach of the rules and absolutely no comparison with the prime minister.” He added: “It was perfectly lawful to meet for work, which is what we were doing. The party that was put to the prime minister on Wednesday happened because an invitation was sent to 100 people saying ‘let’s have some socially distant drinks in the garden and bring your own booze’. There is simply no comparison.” Starmer reiterated hat Johnson must resign in the public interest, saying he had “lost all authority”. He also told the prime minister that he should follow the science when it came to lifting plan B Covid measures and that he should not do it because he was “in a real mess and he’s desperately trying to get out of it”. Starmer said he hoped the restrictions could be lifted as soon as possible but Labour would vote to lift them only if it was the right thing to do. “We’ll be led by the science as we always have been, not by the politics of propping up a broken prime minister,” he said. In the Mail on Sunday, the Conservative MPs Andrew Bridgen and Iain Duncan Smith accused Labour of hypocrisy over the picture of Starmer. Duncan Smith said the Labour leader should apologise while Bridgen said he should refer himself and his colleagues in the photograph for investigation.",News/Politics,Keir Starmer denies drinking beer with staff was breach of rules,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/16/keir-starmer-denies-drinking-beer-with-staff-was-breach-of-rules
1/16/2022,"The physical isolation of chefs working in Michelin-starred kitchens can lead to violent misbehaviour and a feeling that “the rules don’t apply”, a study based on interviews with dozens of top chefs has found. Working long hours away from the bill-paying public in often windowless and cramped kitchens creates a parallel moral universe in which abuse and violence is the norm, the study of 47 chefs at restaurants in Europe, Asia, Australia and north America by academics at Cardiff University found.  It follows a spate of allegations of misconduct in some kitchens in the UK, including at a restaurant in Edinburgh run by the Michelin-starred chef Tom Kitchin, which resulted in the suspension of two staff. His company launched an independent investigation after historical claims of bullying and physical assault last July. A spokesperson for Kitchin said it had since fully implemented recommendations from the investigation with “a group-wide external training programme, enhancing and reinforcing our ethos, policies and procedures to ensure best practice”. Other chefs from different restaurants also posted anonymous complaints on social media about abusive behaviour, in what was known as the hospitality industry’s #MeToo moment. It coincides with the release of Boiling Point, a film starring Stephen Graham about the high stress, aggression and threat of violence of working in a top-ranked kitchen. “People think what they see on TV is exaggerated but what happens is often more severe and has major implications for the mental health and wellbeing of these young, talented people,” said Dr Rebecca Scott, one of the study’s authors. Previous attempts to explain the misbehaviour of chefs have focused on militaristic kitchen cultures, hyper-masculine values and the brutality of physical, stressful, fast-paced work. But this one – in collaboration with a professor of sociology, David Courpasson, in the French culinary hub of Lyon – concludes anyone wanting to stop bullying, violence and intimidation should consider swapping confined kitchens that generate “the perceived ability to act in a generally disinhibited way” for open-plan working environments. Some chefs told researchers they would not misbehave or endure abuse directed at them outside the kitchen but found it “acceptable and normal” once through the swing doors. One chef, Anton, who worked in a restaurant with both an open and closed kitchen described “shouting”, “punching” and “throwing things” in the downstairs closed kitchen but upstairs “they put on a show … they cannot throw stuff”. Another chef told the researchers that being isolated in the kitchen meant “there is an element of kind of getting away with stuff … physical abuse, you know … Being out of sight definitely allows abuse to happen and you do get away without any real consequences.” Dr Robin Burrow, ​​lecturer in organisational behaviour and management at Cardiff University, said isolation could “be experienced as a kind of freedom from scrutiny to do things that would not normally be possible”. Using a phrase from criminology, the study describes kitchen layouts as creating a “geography of deviance”. The majority of the chefs interviewed worked in “backstage” environments, in the least desirable parts of the building. Many had little or no natural light and would work between 12 and 20 hours a day. One chef said: “The isolation creates a backdrop, a stage where one can play up. So, there’s a really strong correlation between bad behaviour and isolation.” Another admitted he followed a junior chef into a room away from the main kitchen and “beat the crap out of him”’ for persistent lateness. “It’s like the army,” he said. “I mean what goes on behind those doors, behind those gates is what goes on.”",Lifestyle/Food,"Chefs’ isolation in kitchens can trigger violence and abuse, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/16/chefs-isolation-in-kitchens-can-trigger-violence-and-abuse-study-finds

1/16/2022,"The tennis world reacted with a mixture of silence and disappointment to the news that Novak Djokovic would be deported from Australia after an extraordinary 12 days concluded with the federal court’s decision to uphold the cancellation of his visa. Andy Murray was conducting his pre-tournament media rounds in Melbourne, a day after his run to the final of the Sydney International, at the exact moment that the outcome of Djokovic’s court proceedings was announced. “Novak is someone I have known since we were 12 years old, he is someone who I respect and have competed against. I don’t like that he is in this situation and I don’t like that he has been in detention,” said Murray to the BBC, speaking minutes after the decision.  “The situation has not been good all round for anyone. It feels everything here happened extremely last-minute and that’s why it became such a mess. Hopefully that won’t be the case at other events so there is no other situation like this. I wouldn’t want that for Novak, don’t want that for tennis and hopefully it is done now.” Djokovic’s visa had been cancelled on Friday by Alex Hawke, the immigration minister, on “health and good order” grounds. The Serb had immediately registered an application to the federal court in order to have his visa cancellation overturned, but Djokovic’s application was finally dismissed on Sunday. During Saturday’s media day, many of the most prominent players said they were dissatisfied by how Djokovic’s visa status had consumed all attention just days before the grand slam. “Honestly, I’m little bit tired of the situation because I just believe that it’s important to talk about our sport, about tennis,” said Rafael Nadal. Emma Raducanu, meanwhile, pointed out that events such as Murray’s run to the final of the Sydney International were being overshadowed. “I feel it has taken away a little bit from the great tennis that’s been happening over this summer in Australia,” she said on Saturday. Most players chose not to address Djokovic’s deportation on social media after his verdict. Those who spoke publicly on Sunday tended to be more sympathetic towards Djokovic, offering their support as he left the country. Alize Cornet, the French women’s No 1, noted the lack of reaction from her fellow players: “I know too little to judge the situation. What I know is that Novak is always the first one to stand for the players. But none of us stood for him. Be strong,” she wrote on twitter. Despite having been a frequent critic of Djokovic over the years, Nick Kyrgios has been one of the world No 1’s most vocal supporters among his peers over the past week. The Australian responded to the verdict with a “facepalm” emoji. Support also came from more predictable sources. Vasek Pospisil, the co-founder alongside Djokovic of the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) and a close friend, immediately spoke for the Serb, stating that Djokovic was “ready to stay home” if he had not received a medical exemption. “Novak would never have gone to Australia if he had not been given an exemption to enter the country by the government (which he did receive; hence Judge Kelly’s initial ruling),” he wrote on Twitter. “He would have skipped the Australian Open and been home with his family and no one would be talking about this mess. There was a political agenda at play here with the elections coming up which couldn’t be more obvious. This is not his fault.” Pospisil misrepresented the verdict of Judge Kelly during Djokovic’s first hearing. The judge had ruled for Djokovic on a procedural basis due to border officials failing to give Djokovic sufficient time to contact his representatives upon his arrival at the airport. His fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanovic, who was supposed to be Djokovic’s opponent in the first round on Sunday, posted a statement on social media in which he pledged to represent Djokovic on the court: “I can’t even imagine how Novak feels, what he has been through for the last 10 days. I was very happy to have the honour of opening this year’s tournament with the first player in the world on Rod Laver Arena. Unfortunately, what I have been thinking about for the last seven days from the moment the draw was made now makes no sense.” In a statement, the ATP referred to the past 12 days as “a deeply regrettable series of events,” while lamenting the absence of Djokovic in the Australian Open draw. “We know how turbulent the recent days have been for Novak and how much he wanted to defend his title in Melbourne. We wish him well and look forward to seeing him back on court soon. ATP continues to strongly recommend vaccination to all players.” The final day before the start of the Australian Open brought one final reflection of Djokovic’s outsized impact over the event. The tournament normally releases its order of play for the first day of competition on Saturday in order to give players as much time as possible to prepare for their matches, but this year the draw was pushed back until after 4pm on Sunday. Djokovic was initially included in Monday’s order of play as the last night match on Rod Laver Arena against Kecmanovic. But by the end of the day, his name had been scrubbed from all lists. As Salvatore Caruso, a lucky loser, prepared to take Djokovic’s spot in the draw, the world No 1 boarded the 10:30pm flight to Dubai and started on his way back home.",Sport/Sport,‘Such a mess’: Andy Murray and tennis world reacts to Djokovic’s deportation,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/16/such-a-mess-andy-murray-tennis-world-react-novak-djokovic-deportation-australia
1/16/2022,"The title of The 4th Country presumably refers to the perceived hierarchy of the constituent nations of the UK: Ulster loyalists and nationalists find rare agreement in believing that Westminster governments prefer the English, Scots, and Welsh. Problematically, though, writer Kate Reid might have used the subtitle: Three Plays. In 80 minutes, she crams “Soldier F”, the only British army member to be charged with killing civil rights marchers during Derry’s Bloody Sunday in 1972; the outlawing of abortion in Northern Ireland for 51 years after it was legal in Great Britain; and the suspension of the devolved assembly at Stormont from 2017-20.  Through a web of connections between lovers, siblings, and officials, the play forces all these issues into one story. But there is an editorial problem with the apparent equivalence given to the legacy of the Troubles and the lack of fertility rights. While the former is a consequence of British colonialism, Westminster long attempted liberalising interventions on abortion that were resisted by Northern Irish politicians. It may have suited all parties to have the 2019 law change effectively imposed from London, as even pro-choicers in Sinn Féin were nervous of resistance from their Catholic demographic. In those complexities of British rule, there might have been a bigger and more coherent play. The triple narrative also ambitiously switches between sharp naturalistic dialogue and Brechtian disruptions in which actors turn against each other and the script, ultimately questioning if drama is adequate to the material or the bald facts are stronger. This manoeuvre is increasingly common in political shows but feels like a cleric stopping mid-sermon to say that a brisk walk might do the congregation more good than church. A third star is earned by perky, versatile performances from Reid, Rachael Rooney, Aiofe Kennan and Cormac Elliott. Each switches roles, with Kennan fluently moving between Derry dialect and two precise gradations of English posh, encouraging the audience to reflect on the conclusions we draw from vocal identities, but the play’s own tone is too diffuse and confused.

1/16/2022,"Joe Root has declared himself ready to lead England’s Test team into a new and potentially more successful era after their latest miserable collapse saw them lose all 10 wickets for 56 runs under the Hobart floodlights to surrender the fifth Test and conclude a one-sided Ashes series with a final act that skirted the border between tragedy and farce.  “I’d love the opportunity to take this team forward and turn things round,” said Root, who has now won 27 of 61 matches as captain over four and a half years. “At the minute we’re going through a real tough period. Performances haven’t been good. But I believe I’m the right man to take this team forward. If that decision is taken out of my hands then so be it, but I’d love the opportunity to take this team forward, and yes I do have the appetite to carry on and turn things around.” Root admitted that, while his commitment to the England captaincy has never wavered, there have been moments when he considered whether “the team needs a slightly different direction and a new voice”. But he has concluded that he can lead them beyond the review that will inevitably follow this tour, and insisted that “good can come out of this series, definitely, if we use it in the right way”. England’s ever-crowded schedule sees their next Test series start against the West Indies in Antigua in just over seven weeks, and though Root admitted that “we can’t keep playing our cricket the way we are – it’s clear as day some of the areas we have to improve on”, he insisted some immediate amelioration “will come from individuals taking a lot from this tour and becoming better players for this experience”. But the 31-year-old also said that long-term success will come only once the current situation, when “anyone that’s coming into the Test team is doing it in spite of county cricket, not because of it”, comes to an end. “Clearly there are some short-term things that need to change, but I think there’s a lot of things long-term that could lead to us having a successful team for a sustained period of time,” Root said. “When do young batters have the opportunity to go out with 450, 500 on the board and deal with scoreboard pressure? You don’t practice it in county cricket, the only time you’re exposed to it is in this environment. When have they had to go out to save a match against a turning ball in spinning conditions? They’ve never been exposed to it, and yet we’re expected to go to the subcontinent and win games against the best spinners in the world. We’re expected to come here and deal with pace and bounce when we might face one guy who bowls over 90mph a season.” Root listed a variety of changes to county cricket, from the schedule and the scoring to the ball itself, that would better prepare young players for Test cricket. “It’s very difficult when you get beaten as heavily as we have done on this tour to convince people I’m the right man,” he said of England’s next chapter. “But I can tell you one thing for sure – as long as I have the opportunity to captain this team, I will throw everything into it and give everything - for everyone supporting us, for the guys around me, for the players – to try and provide an environment that allows us to be successful.”",Sport/Sport,Joe Root wants to lead England into new era despite final Ashes humiliation,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/16/joe-root-wants-to-lead-england-into-new-era-despite-dismal-ashes-australia
1/16/2022,"Italian police have arrested a nurse in Palermo for allegedly pretending to give Covid vaccines to anti-vaxxer activists so they could benefit from official health certificates to travel and access bars, restaurants and public transport in the country. Investigators used a hidden camera to film the nurse, a 58-year-old woman working at a major inoculation centre in the Sicilian capital. The clip, released on Saturday on Twitter, shows the health worker apparently loading up a dose of Covid-19 vaccine and then emptying the syringe into a tissue before injecting it into the arms of anti-vaxxers.  #Digos Palermo ha arrestato un’infermiera impiegata presso il reparto malattie infettive, autrice di fittizie vaccinazioni contro il #Covid_19È indagata per falso ideologico e peculato. Anche lei avrebbe beneficiato di una falsa vaccinazione relativa alla dose booster #15gennaio pic.twitter.com/rQnZi5Q69t Police said the woman’s own booster dose was fake and arrested her on charges of forgery and embezzlement. It is not the first time a nurse has been arrested in Italy for pretending to inject Covid vaccines. Dozens of health workers, including at least three doctors, have been charged or investigated on suspicion of administering fake jabs to people in recent months, with some paying up to €400 (£330) each for the service. Last Wednesday, an Italian nurse in Ancona in the Marche region was arrested for allegedly giving fake Covid vaccines to at least 45 people. The health worker allegedly emptied vaccines into a medical waste bin. According to investigators, anti-vaccine protesters were willing to pay up to €300 for the service in order to receive the so-called “super green pass”, introduced by the Italian government last December and required to access cinemas, gyms, nightclubs and stadiums, as well as to be served indoors at bars and restaurants. The nurse arrested on Friday in Palermo is the second health worker from the same hospital in the city to end up in prison. On 21 December, Sicilian investigators uncovered another alleged scam with dozens of anti-vaccination holdouts, including a police officer, paying a nurse up to €400 to give them fake jabs. The woman, who faces charges of corruption and forgery, recently pleaded guilty and began to collaborate with authorities by revealing the details of the scam and the names of her accomplices. The woman told investigators she injected fake vaccines because she needed money to support her son at university. The nurse also confessed to providing anti-vaxxers with fake certificates with negative Covid swab results. “We have uncovered the dark and fraudulent plots of these diehard, no-vax people who do not hesitate to break the law,” the Palermo police commissioner Leopoldo Laricchia said in a statement. “This investigation also shows how, unfortunately, there are still unvaccinated health workers who work in hospitals in close contact with patients.” As countries in Europe scramble to impose stricter rules to halt the outbreak of the Omicron variant, increasing numbers of anti-vaxxers are attempting to skirt the law to obtain vaccine passports. Early in December in Biella, a town close to Turin in the northern Piedmont region, a man turned up for his Covid-19 vaccine wearing a fake arm made of silicone. After completing the bureaucratic formalities, including signing a consent form in front of a doctor, the man, a 50-year-old dentist, sat down and lifted up the sleeve of his shirt as he prepared for a health worker to administer the jab.
