5/15/2022,"The FBI is investigating Saturday’s mass killing that left 10 people dead and three injured in Buffalo, New York, as a hate crime, the agency said. FBI officials said it is “aggressively investigating” the attack as “an instance of racially motivated violent extremism.” Authorities say Payton Gendron, a heavily armed white 18-year-old man, entered the Tops Friendly Markets store in a predominately Black neighborhood around 2:30 p.m. and unloaded a fusillade of bullets. He identifies himself as a white supremacist. Witnesses said Gendron wore camouflage and looked like he was “in the army.” Reports show he was clad in body armor. The shooter broadcast the onslaught on Twitch, a live-streaming platform. Eleven of the victims were Black, and two were white. “It was straight-up, racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community, outside of the city of good neighbors, as the mayor said, coming into our community and trying to inflict that evil upon us,” Erie County Sheriff John Garcia said in a press briefing. Gendron pleaded not guilty to first-degree felony charges Saturday night. Erie County District Attorney John J. Flynn said it is the highest murder charge in the state. Flynn said he pushed for the suspect to be arraigned Saturday night.

So I assure everyone in this community, justice is being done right now, and justice will be done,” Flynn said during a briefing. Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said Gendron drove hours away from his home in Broome County, New York — more than 200 miles from Buffalo — to commit the crime. He killed three people in the store’s parking lot before exchanging gunfire with a security guard inside, killing the retired police officer. Six of the people Gendron killed were customers, and four were employees. The assailant later surrendered to police after he “put the gun to his own neck,” according to reports. “It’s like walking onto a horror movie, but everything is real. It is Armageddon-like,” a police official at the scene told Buffalo News. “It is so overwhelming.” Katherine Crofton told reporters she saw the suspect shoot a woman going into the store and another putting away groceries. A dairy worker, Will G., told the Buffalo News he heard shots while restocking milk. He and others hid in the cooler. However, some who hid near cash registers did not escape the killer’s deadly ammo, reports show. Others jetted outside and around the store to search for their loved ones and co-workers in the chaos. “I just heard shots. Shots and shots and shots,” Will G. said. “It sounded like things were falling over.” Witnesses said the suspect initially ignored officers’ commands “like he wanted them to shoot him” before they took him down. Gendron faces life without parole for the state felony murder charge. The judge Saturday ordered a forensic examination, and the suspect must return to court in five days for a felony hearing. Media allowed to record, but no live stream.

Investigators are reportedly combing through a 106-page manifesto connected to the shooting that shows admiration for South Carolina church shooter Dylann Roof and the New Zealand mosque shooter Brenton Tarrant, ABC News reports. According to reports, Gendron’s online manifesto shows he developed racist views in recent years, which grew more radical over the past three. Gendron had been “passively preparing” for the massacre for several years, The New York Times reports. He stocked up ammunition and protective gear and occasionally held target practice. In May 2020, Gendron started following anonymous chatter on “white replacement theory.” “If there’s one thing I want you to get from these writings, it’s that White birth rates must change. Everyday the White population becomes fewer in number,” the manifesto reportedly says. “To maintain a population the people must achieve a birth rate that reaches replacement fertility levels, in the western world that is about 2.06 births per woman.” Gendron also created a timeline for the attack, including a layout of the store. The self-proclaimed white supremacist mapped out his parking space, selected his meal beforehand and picked the spot where he would start the live stream. He wrote down his plan to kill the security guard and shoot Black shoppers twice in the chest if he could, reports show. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul slammed Twitch and social medial companies for not taking action against hate speech on their platforms, demanding they be held accountable for allowing “this hate to be spewed and others who are like-minded to be radicalized.” “A community was shattered by an individual, a white supremacist, who has engaged in an act of terrorism and will be prosecuted as such in a cold-hearted, calculated way, a military-style execution targeting people who simply want to buy groceries in a neighborhood store,” Hochul said during a briefing. Representatives for Twitch said the video was removed within two minutes.",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,‘A Military-Style Execution’: 18-Year-Old Accused White Supremacist Kills 10 People In Buffalo Grocery Store In Orchestrated Terror Attack,https://news.yahoo.com/military-style-execution-18-old-030100391.html
5/15/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) -Turkey's foreign minister said on Sunday that Sweden and Finland must stop supporting terrorist groups in their countries, provide clear security guarantees and lift export bans on Turkey as they seek membership in NATO. Speaking after a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Berlin, Mevlut Cavusoglu said he met his Swedish and Finnish counterparts and all were seeking to address Turkey's concerns. He added that Turkey was not threatening anybody or seeking leverage but speaking out especially about Sweden's support for the PKK Kurdish militant group, deemed a terrorist group by Turkey, the European Union and the United States. Finland confirmed on Sunday that it would apply for NATO membership and Sweden is expected to follow suit, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However Turkey's concerns may pose an obstacle, as any decision on NATO enlargement requires unanimous approval by all 30 member states. ""There absolutely needs to be security guarantees here. They need to stop supporting terrorist organizations,"" Cavusoglu told Turkish reporters in Berlin. He added that Swedish and Finnish bans on exporting of some of their defence sector goods to Turkey must end. ""Our stance is perfectly open and clear. This is not a threat, this is not a negotiation where we're trying to leverage our interests,"" he said. ""This is not populism either. This is clearly about two potential member states' support for terrorism, and our solid observations about it, this is what we shared."" Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan surprised NATO allies and the Nordic countries on Friday when he said Turkey could not support the enlargement plans given they were ""home to many terrorist organisations"", but his spokesperson told Reuters on Saturday that Turkey had not shut the door. Cavusoglu repeated that Turkey, which joined NATO 70 years ago, does not oppose its open door policy. He said the talks with Swedish and Finnish counterparts were good and that they made suggestions to alleviate Ankara's legitimate concerns, which Turkey would consider. He said he provided them proof of terrorists living in their states. Cavusoglu again singled out Sweden as disrespecting Turkey's position and said PKK terrorist meetings took place in Stockholm over the weekend.

5/15/2022,"A Lake Norman woman’s $12,000 diamond engagement ring remains missing weeks before her wedding. “It’s heartbreaking,” Kristy Schiano told The Charlotte Observer on Saturday. The ring disappeared after a UPS driver showed up at her Cornelius home in early April with a package containing the ring, she said. The driver returned to his truck with the package after walking up to her front door and around the side of her home, as if looking for someone to sign for the delivery, she said. The package was insured and required a signature, Schiano said. Her Brinks Home Security surveillance footage shows the driver shaking the package as if trying to determine its contents, she said. Schiano is a 49-year-old director of a technology company who has spent the past month trying to track what happened to the custom ring she and her fiancé designed. Two “twist” designs return to the center of the ring. “The twists represent the twists of life,” she said. The return of the twists to the center of the ring symbolizes unity, “just as my fiancé and I are a partnership, are partners,” she said. Her saga began out West on a business trip, she said. She was headed back to the Phoenix airport at about 4:15 one morning when she realized she left the ring in her hotel room in nearby Scottsdale, Arizona, she said. Management quickly found the ring and used a third-party company, I Left My Stuff.com, to mail the ring to her and track its journey to her home, she said. The UPS app, which she also used to track the shipment, informed her of the attempted April 5 package delivery, she said. In separate messages, the UPS app advised her to check for the package at a UPS store near her home and the UPS package transfer station in Charlotte. She did so immediately, and workers at the locations said they had no such package, she said. On April 12, UPS informed her an investigation had begun into the missing package. She heard nothing more until after she contacted WBTV, which interviewed her at her home and posted a story late Wednesday, May 11. On Thursday, she said, she received a call from UPS Security investigator Victor Patrocino, who told her he was looking for her ring. Patrocino didn’t return a message from the Observer left on his work cell phone Saturday night. Replying to a message from the Observer earlier Saturday, the national UPS media office requested the tracking number of the package, Schiano’s name and address and other information, which the newspaper provided. The office had not replied again by Sunday morning. Schiano’s fiancé proposed with the ring in August. At least they have their custom wedding bands for the June 1 ceremony, Schiano said. Unless another twist of fate occurs, the ceremony will be ringless, she said.",U.S./Charlotte Observer,"Her $12,000 diamond engagement ring went missing.

5/15/2022,"Donald Trump criticized Fox News on Saturday, saying it wouldn't air a movie on voter fraud. ""They won't even show or discuss the greatest & most impactful documentary of our time, '2000 Mules,'"" Trump said. ""Fox News is no longer Fox News,"" he added. Former President Donald Trump on Saturday railed against Fox News, saying the network refuses to acknowledge ""2000 Mules,"" a film alleging widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. ""Fox News is no longer Fox News,"" Trump said on Gab.com. ""They won't even show or discuss the greatest & most impactful documentary of our time, '2000 Mules.' The Radical Left Democrats are thrilled - They don't want the TRUTH to get out."" He said it's ""depressing,"" and called for CNN to take the place of Fox News as the most-watched cable news network in the country. ""CNN should go Conservative and take over the greatest, strongest, and most powerful BASE in U.S. history,"" he said. ""Nobody is watching CNN's Fake News now so, as I say, what the hell have they got to lose? Sadly, they're to [sic] stupid to make the change!"" The documentary was created by conservative pundit Dinesh D'Souza, who has also complained recently of it receiving what he perceives to be insufficient airtime. Newsmax ""is also blocking coverage of '2000 Mules,'"" D'Souza wrote on Twitter. ""I was booked on Grant Stinchfield's Newsmax show and then the network cancelled on me. Criticize the move if you like, but why isn't this a legitimate news story? How can so-called news networks pretend it doesn't exist?"" Trump heralded ""2000 Mules"" and said it exposed ""great election fraud,"" a claim that has been repeatedly debunked since he lost the 2020 presidential election. After the results of the 2020 presidential election, the Trump campaign has filed dozens of lawsuits alleging voter fraud, most of which have so far been denied, dismissed, or withdrawn. Independent election watchdog groups have repeatedly said there was no widespread voter fraud. After the results came out, for example, The New York Times contacted election officials in every state, each of which said there is no evidence that fraud influenced the presidential election. But even since leaving office, Trump has continued to insist that the election was rigged. Republican lawmakers and Trump supporters have also echoed his unsubstantiated claims.
