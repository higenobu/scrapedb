Central bank officials are expected to double the pace of tapering the Fed’s bond-buying -- to $30 billion a month, wrapping up in March -- while forecasting two interest-rate hikes next year, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Tough Landing Summers, who has been warning of the dangers of elevated inflation for months, said it would be very hard for the Fed to rein in excessive price gains without also damaging the economy. “The Fed will have a very difficult time organizing a soft landing,” he said, noting the long and variable lags between monetary-policy actions and their impact on the economy. “All the efforts at disinflation that we have had historically, where it was clearly established that inflation was too high and the Fed acted, have ended in recession.” He called on the the Fed to immediately stop buying mortgage-backed securities and wind up its purchases of Treasury debt “probably by the end of February.” “I would be establishing a presumption that the Fed will do whatever is necessary to bring inflation under control, and that quite possibly that could involve four rate increases during the next year and more after that,” he said.
