3/24/2022,"A former top prosecutor from the Manhattan DA's office said in his resignation letter that Trump is guilty of ""numerous"" felonies, NYT reported. Mark Pomerantz and Carey Dunne, who were leading the DA's Trump probe, abruptly resigned last month. Dunne and Pomerantz planned to charge Trump with falsifying business records, per NYT. One of the two top prosecutors who suddenly left the Manhattan district attorney's office last month said in his resignation letter that he believes former President Donald Trump is guilty of ""numerous"" felonies, The New York Times reported. ""The team that has been investigating Mr. Trump harbors no doubt about whether he committed crimes — he did,"" the prosecutor, Mark Pomerantz, said in his resignation latter, according to The Times. Pomerantz and Carey Dunne, the other senior prosecutor who was leading the DA's criminal investigation into the Trump Organization's business dealings, resigned in February after the new district attorney, Alvin Bragg, expressed doubts about moving forward with a case against the former president. Pomerantz said in his resignation letter, dated February 23, that Trump was in fact ""guilty of numerous felony violations"" and that it would be a ""grave failure of justice"" to not hold him accountable for his actions, according to The Times. The report said that Pomerantz and Dunne had planned to charge Trump with falsifying business records, which is a felony in the state of New York. But Bragg's reluctance to pursue a criminal case against Trump, and Pomerantz and Dunne's subsequent resignations, has thrown the fate of the longrunning criminal investigation into disarray. A spokesperson for the DA's office previously told Insider that ""the investigation is ongoing"" and ""we can't comment further."" The DA's office has fought to keep the resignation letters of Pomerantz and Dunne from becoming public. The letters ""reflect internal deliberations and opinions about an on-going investigation,"" a records official told Insider in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.""Further, the documents reference matters attending a grand jury proceeding, which is exempt from disclosure."" The DA's office previously indicted the Trump Organization and its longtime chief bookkeeper, Allen Weisselberg, on 15 felony counts. Trump has not been charged with a crime. The first round of charges stemming from the inquiry, brought against the Trump Organization and Weisselberg, zeroed in on alleged tax-evasion schemes. But the investigation later shifted to focus on whether the Trump Organization, and Trump himself, artificially inflated or deflated the value of assets for loan and tax purposes, respectively. The DA's investigation had recently homed in on whether Trump exaggerated his financial net worth when applying for loans. His longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA, cut ties with him earlier in February after determining, based on revelations from a separate civil investigation by the New York attorney general's office, that ten years of his financial statements ""should no longer be relied upon.""

3/24/2022,"By Phil Stewart WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia's combat power in Ukraine has declined below 90 percent of its pre-invasion levels for the first time since its attack began, a senior U.S. defense official said on Tuesday, suggesting heavy losses of weaponry and growing casualties. The United States has estimated Russia assembled more than 150,000 troops around Ukraine before the Feb. 24 invasion, along with enough aircraft, artillery, tanks and other firepower for its full-scale attack. ""For the first time they may be just a little bit below 90 percent,"" the U.S. defense official told reporters on condition of anonymity. The official did not provide evidence. Nearly a month into the war, Russian troops have failed to capture a single major city and their advance has been halted on nearly all fronts by Ukrainian forces. Moscow has instead turned to bombarding cities with artillery, missiles and bombs. Russia denies targeting civilians. Much of that bombardment has been focused on the southeastern city of Mariupol. The senior U.S. official said Russian naval forces have likely been firing into Mariupol from the Sea of Azov over the past 24 hours. ""That wasn't the case yesterday,"" the official said. Russia has not officially updated its casualty figures since stating on March 2 that 498 servicemen had been killed and 1,597 wounded. But since then its offensive has run into further heavy resistance from Ukraine's army and volunteer defense forces. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan estimated on Tuesday the number of Russian casualties was in the thousands but declined to offer a precise figure. As the conflict takes its toll, the United States has warned that Russia might seek assistance from China. Still, the White House said on Tuesday it had not seen any evidence of China providing military equipment to Russia. The U.S. official suggested that there were no indications Russia was yet pulling additional supplies into Ukraine. ""But we do continue to see indications that they are having these discussions, and that they are making those kinds of plans both in terms of resupply, and also reinforcement,"" the official said. Putin's incursion into Ukraine has forced more than 3.5 million to flee, brought the unprecedented isolation of Russia's economy as Western nations imposed sanctions, and raised fears of wider conflict in the West unthought-of for decades. Putin calls the conflict a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize Ukraine and replace its pro-Western leadership, and says it's going to plan.
