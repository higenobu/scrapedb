3/26/2022,"Simon Case, the head of the civil service, has emerged as one of those to have been sent a questionnaire about the No 10 lockdown parties, amid continuing speculation that senior government figures will be interviewed by police. It is understood Case was sent a quiz by the Metropolitan police in the same round of questionnaires as other senior government figures, including the prime minister and chancellor. The Met said earlier this week that it intended to start questioning witnesses, prompting speculation that Johnson himself could be spoken to by officers. No 10 last confirmed on Tuesday that Boris Johnson had not been interviewed at that point. A No 10 spokesperson said on Friday: “We don’t have anything further to add.” However, it is understood his allies believe he will not be questioned because the police said they wanted to speak to witnesses, rather than those under investigation. Asked whether Case had been interviewed by police, a Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “It would not be appropriate to comment on speculation. The cabinet secretary and the prime minister are fully focused on the vital work this government is doing on the illegal invasion of Ukraine.” The police statement – issued two months after inquiries began – suggested officers have not yet found breaches that meet the evidentiary threshold for fixed-penalty notices to be issued without further interviews. No FPNs have been issued so far, the force said. The update suggested the investigation may be some way off being concluded. The Met said it “involves a significant amount of investigative material; the serving of over 100 questionnaires and the need to individually assess every response”. It added: “The offences under consideration comprise a number of elements and the legislation itself changed between the event dates. We are progressing the investigation as quickly as possible. “As yet, we have not made any referrals to the Acro criminal records office for the issuing of fixed-penalty notices. However, every questionnaire response is being assessed alongside all available evidence, and should this reach the evidential threshold, then referrals will be made.” Ministers are publicly expressing confidence that Johnson will not be issued with a penalty by police. Oliver Dowden, the Tory co-chair, told LBC: “The prime minister is actually absolutely resolutely clear that he is not going to be subject to a fixed-penalty notice because he is confident that he has not broken the law.” The announcement that the Met were now seeking interviews with those involved prompted incredulity from senior Whitehall sources. “The police have had all the evidence they need that rules were broken for months,” one said. It comes two months after police began examining material from the Whitehall inquiry by the senior civil servant Sue Gray, meaning it is now unlikely a verdict on Johnson will be reached before the May local elections. Scotland Yard obtained more than 300 photographs and 500 pages of documents showing what Gray’s inquiry believes to be potential rule-breaking. Images include photos taken at parties and those taken from security-system cameras showing when people entered and exited buildings.",News/Politics,No 10 lockdown parties: police questions sent to civil service head ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/25/no-10-lockdown-parties-simon-case-police-questionnaire
3/26/2022,"The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix is at risk of being cancelled after Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a missile attack on an oil facility less than 10 miles from the circuit. The seriousness of the situation was made clear when drivers and team principals were called to see F1’s chief executive, Stefano Domenicali, so they could be updated on the situation and how it is being handled, delaying second practice on Friday. It is understood Domenicali has informed the teams that the weekend will proceed as planned and that the Saudi authorities have prioritised security for the meeting. However he is going to hold another meeting with principals and drivers later on Friday evening. After the attack, huge plumes of black smoke rising high into the sky were clearly visible from the circuit. The Houthi rebels, who have been embroiled in war with a Saudi-led coalition for seven years, claimed to have carried it out, with Saudi state media saying the coalition had foiled a string of Houthi drone and rocket attacks. Last Sunday the Houthis attacked another oil facility in Jeddah as part of another wave of strikes. F1 were sufficiently concerned then that they stated they were monitoring the situation but there will be huge concern now at the proximity, timing and fears of another attack. Key in making any decision will rest on whether teams and personnel feel safe. Should they lose confidence in their security, even that of a single team, then F1 and the FIA would have little choice but to abandon the grand prix. At the start of the Covid pandemic in 2020 it was the withdrawal of McLaren in Australia after one of their personnel contracted the virus that swiftly led to others following suit and the race was cancelled soon afterwards. There has yet to be any further official statement from F1 or the Saudi authorities. Before the attack, Lewis Hamilton was unequivocal in demanding F1 does more to instigate reform in Saudi Arabia if the sport continues to race there. With the state accused of sportswashing and having recently executed 81 people in one day, the seven-times champion admitted he was shocked when he received a letter from a teenager sentenced to death for a crime he was alleged to have committed when he was 14. Saudi Arabia’s human rights record has attracted enormous criticism – including allegations of indiscriminate bombing of civilians in Yemen – and placed F1 once more under the spotlight for assisting in legitimising the activities of the regime. Hamilton placed the pressure firmly on F1 to make a difference since the drivers have no say on the countries his sport visits. “Ultimately, it is the responsibility of those who are in power to really make the changes and we are not really seeing enough, we need to see more,” he said. “We don’t decide where we go to race in Formula One, but while it is not necessarily our responsibility, we are duty-bound to try and do what we can.” Hamilton’s unease at racing in Saudi Arabia had not changed from last year’s race when he said he was “not comfortable” with F1 competing in the country. As revealed by the Guardian on Thursday Hamilton was written to earlier this week by the family of Abdullah al-Howaiti, who was sentenced to death for a crime they maintain he did not commit and was a minor when he was alleged to have done so. Hamilton acknowledged he was aware of the letter and that its subject matter left him reeling. “It’s mind-blowing to hear the stories,” he said. “I’ve heard there is a letter sent to me from a 14-year-old on death row. When you’re 14 you don’t know what the hell you’re doing in life.” Hamilton has attempted to ensure he is aware of human rights issues and met with representatives from some of the countries involved in an attempt to effect change. The British driver remained committed to doing so but questioned why the authorities in Saudi Arabia and F1 itself were apparently oblivious to the need for reform. “It is important we try to educate ourselves and with a little bit of difference, we can try to make sure we are doing something,” he said. “I am always open to having a discussion, to learning more and trying to understand exactly why things are happening and why they are not changing. It is 2022 and it is easy to make changes.” With his Mercedes off the pace of the leaders he is searching for change too on track if the race takes place but is unlikely to enjoy any great steps forward this weekend. With his car suffering from the bouncing due to a downforce stall on straights, Mercedes are still working on an aerodynamic solution. Hamilton was sixth-tenths off Charles Leclerc’s pole position last week in Bahrain and the team have no quick fix. Mercedes’s chief technical director, Andrew Shovlin, has said it could take two or three more races to solve their problems. Ferrari and Red Bull were in a class of their own at Bahrain last week with the Scuderia’s Leclerc taking a one-two with Carlos Sainz. Mercedes were flattered by third and fourth, positions inherited after the Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and Sergio Pérez retired with a fuel system problem the team said it has now successfully resolved. The battle between Ferrari and Red Bull is set to be fascinating. They are closely matched on pace, with Ferrari’s new engine proving to be hugely competitive. However Jeddah is a different circuit to Bahrain, where there is a preponderance of slow corners. Jeddah is quick, indeed some drivers have suggested dangerously so, with a combination of close walls and blind corners. Ferrari were strong in Bahrain through and in acceleration out of the slower corners while Red Bull enjoyed the superior straight-line pace. How they perform in Jeddah will be another indicator of relative strengths and weaknesses.",Sport/Sport,Saudi Arabian Grand Prix at risk of cancellation after Houthi missile attack,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/25/saudi-arabian-grand-prix-at-risk-of-cancellation-after-houthi-missile-attack
3/26/2022,"When I first met Ryan “The Brickman” McNaught a decade ago, I had my two bug-eyed sons (7 and 5, respectively) in tow. He was – and remains – the only Lego-certified professional in the southern hemisphere, and they were Lego-crazy back then. It was their first glimpse of what was at the time McNaught’s most complex commission: an intricate cross-sectioned model of the Roman Colosseum, rendered in more than 200,000 Lego blocks and installed in the University of Sydney’s Nicholson Museum. A year later, we met again, this time in his immaculately organised garage in Pascoe Vale South in Melbourne, not far from Essendon Football Club’s Windy Hill. He was deep into the making of an even bigger archaeology inspired model: Lego Pompeii, now on display in the University of Sydney’s Chau Chak Wing Museum. My boys – no less bug-eyed than before – contributed two mini-figures of themselves eating a pre-eruption ice-cream in the town stadium. “Yeah, the old place,” McNaught reminisces, when we speak for a third time this week. “Just me in the garage, right? Like all good businesses, that’s where it starts. Now I have 25 staff and a whole workshop. A lot has changed.” It sure has. McNaught has risen from cultish obscurity to co-star of the top-rating TV show, Lego Masters. His latest project – Jurassic World by Brickman – is on show at the Australian Museum: a movie series-inspired exhibition built by his team with more than 6m bricks, featuring a 400kg, 4.8-metre-long model of a Baryonyx, a baby dinosaur enclosure, models of movie props and vehicles and a building area where visitors can make models of their own from a pile of 2.5m pieces. It’s here where he’s also giving a series of three Lego masterclasses. When Guardian Australia attends the first, he’s on the mic, working the crowd of mostly middle-aged men who identify as Afols, or Adult Fans of Lego. “Put your hands in the air if you think Lego Masters is better than MAFS!” he offers, before prompting: “Yes it is!” Bouncing around in Nike sneakers in Lego-like colours – bright green, yellow, red –and a short-sleeved shirt in a block-like pattern, McNaught, 49, talks quickly and emphatically as he guides guests through the exhibit. Lots of energy. Heaps of enthusiasm. Lots of “nerding out” with facts and figures: “The T-rex has 400,000 Lego bricks. How do we measure that? We know what we started with and then count what’s left over.” The Lego dinosaurs are internally braced with steel and the bricks cemented together for safety, he tells us. “We don’t want it to collapse if a small child hugs the dinosaur.” The solvent is also used in the manufacture of methamphetamine, he adds. “So don’t lick the dinosaurs.” This is one of many dad jokes. “I love to laugh,” he tells Guardian Australia. “But I’m also a thinker. I love to solve problems.” My boys – now 17 and 15 – don’t play with Lego any more. It’s all in a pile of plastic tubs in the garage collecting dust and spiders. “Don’t get rid of it!” McNaught says. “All kids around 14 stop playing Lego. They want to let go of their toys. Even I did. I pretty much packed it away for cricket, footy and BMX bikes.” McNaught, who grew up in regional Victoria, didn’t get back into Lego until just before he had kids of my own. “My mum said, you’d better have all your junk back – she never threw anything out – and with all that came a couple of milk crates of Lego.” That reunion with his childhood passion sparked a slow career change: from solidly established travel industry IT manager with a wife, mortgage and twin boys to being headhunted by Lego execs after McNaught designed a software package that allowed Lego Mindstorms engineering to be controlled via an iPad. You can sense it wasn’t a seamless transition. “I got to a stage where I was working eight hours a day in IT, building Lego for eight hours when I got home, and raising a family for the other eight hours. Something’s gotta give, right?” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning When I met McNaught in his garage in 2012, his wife, Melinda, brought tea and biscuits. He now lives in Essendon with his new partner, Tracy Britten. “We run marathons,” he says. “We’ve done 12 now and we try to do them in unusual places. We did the Moscow Marathon in 2018 – won’t be doing that again – and we did one in North Korea. We did the Falkland Islands, a Disney marathon in America … I ran with Mickey Mouse!” I wouldn’t have picked him for a long-distance runner back in 2012. “Well, when you’re a middle-aged man you have to look after yourself a bit better,” he says. When your doctor says, ‘mate, take a look at your cholesterol’, you have to take it seriously.” In 2019, McNaught signed on as judge and resident expert on Nine’s Lego Masters. A sizeable ratings hit, the show is now into its third season. Even now, he still doesn’t feel like a media figure. “Most of the time I don’t get recognised unless it’s in context at some kind of Lego event,” he says. “Hamish [Blake, his Lego Masters co-star] can take all that stuff to be honest. “Apart from the TV stuff, I still do pretty much the same thing – make interesting stuff out of Lego. What has changed is the popularity of it. Lego was never what you’d call niche but it was relatively obscure compared to what it’s become today.” He says more than two years and 10,000 build hours went into the Jurassic World project. “It got us through that Covid period when all the exhibition work dried up. I woke up every day thinking about what the kids’ experience will be when they first see it. It made me think about what I would have wanted to see if I was a kid. “When I was young, I wanted to open the batting for Australia,” says McNaught, a handy cricketer who played for South Yarra in the 1990s. “But there’s a point where you realise that some things aren’t achievable. But with Lego, you don’t have that barrier. It’s a thing everyone can achieve something in. It’s relatable, as dreams go. Now I feel I have a position to be a role model in that way, for other kids with dreams.” Jurassic World is open at the Australian Museum, Sydney",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Don’t get rid of your old Lego!’: Ryan ‘The Brickman’ McNaught’s unlikely rise to fame,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/26/dont-get-rid-of-your-old-lego-ryan-the-brickman-mcnaughts-unlikely-rise-to-fame
3/26/2022,"In early February the federal Coalition government announced it would end its three-year freeze on the indexation of funding for the ABC. Having reduced ABC funding by a total of $84m since 2019, the decision was a barely disguised effort to neutralise the public broadcaster as an issue ahead of the imminent election. Given its record of overt hostility towards the national broadcaster over the past nine years, it is important to ask what does the Morrison government really want for the ABC if it is re-elected? One thing we know the government does not want from the ABC is for its comedians to call people “cunts”. It doesn’t want the ABC to use the phrase “Invasion Day”. We know the government didn’t want the date of Triple J’s Hottest 100 changed, and so it would probably prefer it go back to where it came from, so to speak – 26 January. It wants the ABC to do more “public-interest journalism”, but not if it concerns allegations Australian troops killed unarmed men in Afghanistan, not if it concerns private lives in the Canberra bubble, and not if it concerns conspiracy-peddling individuals in the prime minister’s orbit. What does the government want for the ABC? First, to be content with what it gets. “Everyone has to live within their means, including the ABC,” Scott Morrison said in 2018. It does not want the ABC to respond to funding cuts by cutting programs: “That would be cowardly,” declared Malcolm Turnbull. Nor by closing bureaus: “A deliberate act of political vandalism,” Christopher Pyne said. It certainly does not want public campaigns about cuts, which senator James Paterson has dubbed clumsy “political blackmail”. In 2018, Morrison scoffed at the idea of more ABC funding, and suggested with a hint of menace that those in the ABC pressing for more should be ashamed: “They’ve been getting a free ride.” According to the prime minister, the safest place for journalists to work is the ABC, precisely because it is government-funded. Therefore, setting aside that ABC journalists are berated in a way and with an intensity that those at other news organisations are not, the government seems to have neither the time nor the inclination for questions about the manner in which it provides for the ABC. It would rather employees of the national broadcaster assumed a position of gratitude, said thank you and went on their way. A good chunk of MPs in government, if given their own way, would like to see the ABC privatised. Others would prefer it downsized, made into a market-failure broadcaster only, with a charter that keeps it on a tight leash. A select few would prefer its ambit remain much as it is, though with a dramatically recalibrated understanding of “objectivity”, perhaps in line with Tony Abbott’s suggestion that included “basic affection for the home team”. To Malcolm Turnbull, a new objectivity would include “genuinely accurate and impartial” coverage, in which the ABC would rise above the fray. The more ABC-friendly in government think it should be more positive. Nationals MP Darren Chester told us that the ABC had a “negative view of Australian culture and society”, that it “talks the country down a bit”. It should reconsider, he said. For a story on disadvantage in Indigenous communities, why not a “more constructive” story about the solutions? The ABC, in this thinking, should be much like its old nickname, Aunty: cheery, benign, inoffensive. The more transactional think the money government provides means the ABC should take direction from government. They have little time for niceties like editorial independence. “We have to pay for you,” Barnaby Joyce said when an ABC journalist pushed back on his suggestion it should cover a particular story. “And, you know, that’s a substantive part of the budget.” Similarly, some in government think the ABC needs to be more responsive to complaints, and to reach out more: to find the mythical “rightwing Philip Adams” and put them on air, preferably in prime time and on a prominent station. After all, one conservative commentator told Jonathan Holmes, audiences on the right did not think anything on the ABC resonated with them, and were angered by this. “They just don’t see why they should go on paying for it,” remarked Holmes. From the energising effect of this anger, and the government’s self-interest in fanning it in order to unite supporters in opposition to a common foe, it seems fair to surmise that the government, at the root of all its talk about bias and standards and funding security, would really like for Aunty to be Aunt Sally: a target for sticks and stones that never dodges or fights back but stands, fixed in place, smiling and silent. Leaders of the major media organisations in Australia doubtless have their own desires. Some would prefer the ABC continue to develop talent and content that they can poach. Others, aggrieved by a belief that they are shouldering unprofitable obligations, would prefer the ABC were given sole carriage of areas that they no longer have an interest in, like children’s programming or rural and regional content. More, contending with a difficult and turbulent business environment, would prefer that the ABC were overhauled and constrained by legislation from doing anything that might duplicate what the commercial media does already. A particular ideological strand also infects these desires. When the Australian’s Paul Kelly argued that “politics defines the market position of a media organisation”, he was referring to the supposed hoax of an impartial public broadcaster in the modern era. But Kelly could also have been writing about the organisation for which he has worked the better part of his journalistic career. To adopt his view of a politically defined media market is to see that News Corp Australia’s newspapers and television broadcasts are positioned to cater to that rightwing audience to which Holmes referred, to attract subscription dollars and advertising revenue. There is a rampant ideological and commercial self-interest, then, in having the ABC to beat up – even on the most spurious of grounds. Where this leaves the ABC is at a buffeted intersection of criticism that is political, ideological and commercial in nature: in effect, as one front in a broader culture war that ranges from the universities to the arts to the social welfare sector. It is an invidious place to be. The point of a culture war is never to vanquish the target of criticism. Culture wars, like those on terror or drugs or poverty, are never won, never declared over. They only exist to create and foster new lines of division. Or, as the satirical online site the Onion once put it: “Drugs win drugs war”. The ABC should not be a player in that culture war. While the case for the continuation of a thriving public broadcaster in Australia is clear, there are areas for improvement. These include an adherence to proper process for appointments to the ABC’s board, ceasing the use of tied funding and indexation freezes, extending the three-year funding period to five years, and a respectful, constructive relationship between government and the ABC in which politicians recognise they are custodians of office only, and bear the responsibility to pass to their successors a country and government better off than they inherited. These solutions are, at one level, technocratic. But to leave them to be implemented by technocrats and our elected representatives would be a mistake. The ABC’s future is reliant less on the Liberal-National Coalition and the Labor party than it is on us. The ABC is a national institution that belongs to each of us, and its future should be of concern to all of us. In 2007, when the ABC turned 75, the Sydney Morning Herald asked what Australia would look like without the ABC: “You can imagine an Australia but not this Australia.” Let’s ask another question: imagine the ABC if its funding had not been cut, if its governance had not been so politicised, if its journalism had not been so subject to self-interested attack, if it had not been sucked into the culture wars. Imagine if its role had been celebrated and championed instead of dismissed and damned. What would that look like? It is possible to envision an ABC that is vibrant, relevant and confident, producing and broadcasting programs of world-class quality, in a variety of forms, appealing to all comers; that is engaged with Australian life and culture; that explores with a liberal, adventurous spirit what might be possible. It is possible, too, to envision a world where both government and the ABC acknowledge the inherent tension in their relationship but act with respect for the institutions they each embody. It is possible, in short, to envision a national broadcaster of which we all are proud, and which continues to make an invaluable contribution to the life of this country. Thus, as the ABC nears its 90th birthday and moves toward its centenary in 2032, we offer this answer to the titular question of our book, Who Needs the ABC? We all do. This is an edited extract from Who Needs the ABC? Why taking it for granted is no longer an option, by Matthew Ricketson and Patrick Mullins.

3/26/2022,"The first woman to head Australia’s competition and consumer watchdog is set to break away from the path set by her predecessor. After a 25-year career dominated by defending the big end of town from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, lawyer Gina Cass-Gottlieb is now its chair. She has one of the biggest jobs in the country. The ACCC oversees everything from trying to send members of price-fixing cartels to jail to curbing the instincts of business towards monopoly by merging into ever larger companies as well as safety issues such as button batteries that children can swallow or quad bikes that are prone to flipping over. There is a lot to cover, and the spotlight is relentless: the ACCC’s three previous chairs – Allan Fels, Graeme Samuel and, most recently, its longest-serving, Rod Sims – have been canny in their exploitation of the media, appearing everywhere from breakfast TV to serious broadsheets to drive their messages home. That’s something Cass-Gottlieb says she will continue – she’ll “come out promptly and urgently” when circumstances demand, she tells Guardian Australia. And she is also keen to continue pursuing another of Sims’ agendas, the battle against big tech companies such as Google, Facebook and Apple. But, after a week in the job, she seems a lot less keen on another of Sims’ big ideas: making it harder for big companies to merge in order to bring more competition to a country where oligopolies – four big banks, two big miners, two big airlines – prevail. In August last year, Sims, who in 11 years atop the ACCC never won a single court case where the regulator challenged a merger, launched detailed proposals to strengthen the regulator’s powers and make it easier to prevail before judges who have historically been happy to let even Australia’s biggest companies walk down the aisle. Cass-Gottlieb says it’s “an important debate” but won’t give a definitive answer when pressed on whether she agrees with Sims’ proposals. “I embrace the debate,” she says, pointing out that other countries including the UK and US are also reviewing their merger rules. She also points out that when we speak on Thursday she’s been chair of the ACCC for a grand total of four days. “I want to take some time – which doesn’t mean a lot of time – but I want to take some time together with the commissioners,” she says. “Rod kicked off the points, expressed the need, but was very clear that it’s the kicking off of a debate, not detailed proposals, and we now need to do the work. “It’s an important debate, I’m going to be an active member of the debate.” It’s not a position Cass-Gottlieb can be shifted from, even when Guardian Australia points out that as one of Australia’s most experienced competition lawyers she must have some view on how the system should operate. Her reticence is understandable. She doesn’t say so, but it would be difficult to push on with law reform proposals that were slapped down by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, almost the moment they came out of Sims’ mouth. On the other hand, if Labor takes power in an election due in May, as polls predict, the door to reform is not completely closed. If four days is too soon for Cass-Gottlieb to make up her mind about mergers, it is plenty of time to decide whether to keep going with the ACCC’s campaign to rein in big tech companies such as Google, Facebook and Apple – a campaign that has been good for media companies, including Guardian Australia, tipping an estimated $200m a year into the coffers of Australia’s news providers. While Sims’ proposals for tougher merger laws had him in the Frydenberg freezer, the attack on tech multinationals was warmly embraced by the treasurer. After tackling social media platforms on their treatment of news providers, Google and others on the opaque way they sell ads and even reverse engineering the Trivago algorithm to sting the travel booking site for misleading consumers over hotel rates, the ACCC is now tackling big tech over the way it treats small business. “That is going to be a key piece of work, considering what are the areas that need new regulation and the effective modes of new regulation, given the position and market position of digital platforms,” Cass-Gottlieb says. She has also committed to continuing to bring criminal cartel cases, despite the collapse in February of a landmark prosecution of bankers over a capital raising by bank ANZ. The case never reached a jury, with the commonwealth director of public Prosecutions withdrawing the charges following a series of legal setbacks that included the judge in the case describing the CDPP’s case as a “complete shemozzle”. Like every regulator who is speaking on the record, Cass-Gottlieb won’t criticise the CDPP over its poor record in prosecuting complex white-collar crime, which, when regulators are speaking off the record, is an eternal source of frustration. Laying blame would not be “helpful or appropriate”, she says. “The ACCC has commenced a consideration of the matter, from the beginning of the investigation through, and we are going to learn the lessons from that.” She points out the ACCC and the CDPP need to put up criminal cases that “both survive legal challenges before a federal court judge” and “satisfy 12 ordinary people sitting in a jury who need to then look through all that legal complexity of a cartel contravention”. Asked what her agenda is, she says she is “absolutely committed” to the priorities the ACCC has already put forward for the year. “Covid-impacted supply chains, the question of the truthfulness of environmental claims and environmental sustainability, claims of greenwashing, the problem of protection of small business, the global supply chain issues,” she says. “There are immediate as at this point in time issues and then the enduring priorities that we’ve seen in cartel enforcement, consumer law enforcement.” None of this stuff is new territory for Cass-Gottlieb. For decades, she’s been among Australia’s preeminent competition lawyers, most recently as a partner at big firm Gilbert + Tobin. But while a star in her field, she’s more or less unknown to the general public – something that’s about to change very quickly. Especially during the pandemic, it seemed like Sims was on TV or radio or in a newspaper almost every day, either allowing cooperation to keep things like supermarket supply chains going or warning Qantas against feasting on smaller rival airline Virgin, which was on the verge of collapse. Cass-Gottlieb says that in her early days she may not do as much press as her predecessors, but she will be visible – she’s already been getting media training from her handlers at the ACCC. “I’m going to pop up regularly and I’m going to do that because it’s a key part of the job of being the chair, and it’s key because the community must have trust that the ACCC is active, a champion for consumers in every respect, and going to maintain competitiveness of markets across the economy,” she says. She’s conscious that the exposure is beyond her comfort zone. “But one of the points I have been conscious of is I’m a strong believer in increasing diversity and that if I, as a senior woman, did not say I’m prepared to push outside my comfort zone, there won’t be change,” she says. She comes from a family with a history of public service in medicine: her father, Cecil Cass, was one of Australia’s most distinguished orthopedic surgeons, her mother, Bettina, a pioneering sociologist and women’s rights activist and her uncle, Moss Cass, who died this month, was also a doctor, although he was better known as the first ever minister for the environment in the Whitlam government, as well as the minister for media. Given Moss Cass’s criticism of the Murdoch media empire as “paranoid”, it seems odd that his niece ended up as a trustee of the media family’s trust – a role that attracted criticism when Cass-Gottlieb was announced as new ACCC head. She says she quit the role last year, before being appointed to the ACCC. “It was a regulatory compliance role, which I was asked to take up after the prior partner of another law firm who was in the role retired,” she says. “It was not a role where I was advising on the transactions or operations of the business, either locally or globally.” If the ANZ cartel case went ahead, Cass-Gottlieb would have had to excuse herself from discussing it because she represented one of the banks involved in the case, JP Morgan. But despite a storied career during which she’s represented everyone from media group Nine Entertainment to French train maker Alstom, she says she has “less than 20” outstanding conflicts of interest registered with the ACCC where she will have to stand out of discussions because she has confidential information. “There are actually fewer than one would expect, which is because the commission has such a huge slate of matters before it, and I was only one of many advisers,” she says. “I have left behind every prior client relationship, they are all terminated. I have taken this role, clearly and consciously, to contribute to the benefit of the public, and I’m deeply conscious of those obligations and inspired by them.”",News/Australia news,The power of one: Gina Cass-Gottlieb on becoming the first woman to lead the ACCC,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/26/the-power-of-one-gina-cass-gottlieb-on-becoming-the-first-woman-to-lead-the-accc
3/26/2022,"Major staffing shortages have forced schools in New South Wales and Victoria back into remote learning as the new Omicron sub-variant BA.2 sees Covid cases rise. NSW recorded 23,702 new Covid cases on Friday and seven deaths, with rates of infections in the state highest among those aged 10-19 years old. Victoria recorded 9,244 new cases and nine deaths. The Victorian and NSW governments have resisted the reintroduction of mandatory Covid restrictions, instead placing individual responsibility on schools and parents before an anticipated increase in cases this winter. A teacher at a western Sydney public school, who wished to remain anonymous, said “at least” 20 children had been absent from school every day in the past week due to testing positive or being required to isolate. “In my class alone, we had seven students away today,” she said, adding that outbreaks among teachers were placing a huge strain on staff. “It’s been extremely difficult to find casual teachers which has resulted in classes being split quite regularly,” she said. “We suspect it’s because of fears around contracting Covid at school.” She said the situation was harder because there was “no real way to manage outbreaks” at schools since restrictions lifted. On 23 March, in response to “increasing Covid-19 cases in the community”, NSW Health allowed schools to introduce temporary measures like mask-wearing in the instance of a Covid outbreak. Since term one, children have been able to continue to attend school in NSW if there’s a positive case in their class, as long as they do not have symptoms. All positive cases must be registered with Service NSW and eligible children are required to be vaccinated. Husband’s school in Melbourne is closing tomorrow & moving online due to spike in covid numbers. So many teachers away they can’t staff in person learning properly. In Victoria, twice-weekly rapid antigen testing is “strongly recommended” for students but there is no requirement to report results and children don’t need a negative test to attend school. Free RATs have been made available for staff and students throughout term one, which may end early if recommended by health advice. One parent based in Melbourne told Guardian Australia they had received notification that a positive Covid case had been detected in six classrooms across their child’s primary school in a single day this week. They said usually one or two classes had been affected. Carinya school in the Sydney suburb of Mortdale was forced to close to face-to-face learning for a week due to a large Covid outbreak. On 14 March, the NSW Department of Education sent a letter to parents and carers advising “recent impacts from Covid-19” had meant a number of staff, support officers and students had tested positive. “We know the best place for our students to learn is in the classroom but the safety and wellbeing of our students and staff is the department’s number one priority,” the letter said. It came four days after the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, warned Covid cases were expected to double in the state within six weeks as BA.2 spread. While the school returned to face-to-face learning on 18 March, a further positive case was detected less than a week later. Castle Hill high in Sydney also had to temporarily revert some students to studying from home due to staff shortages in the region. The same situation occurred at Notre Dame college in the regional Victorian city of Shepparton, where the deputy principal, Jennifer Frisardi, said staff shortages had been looming for some time but was “brought … to a head” by the pandemic. “There have been teachers who have chosen to retire earlier than they might have otherwise, sometimes as a result of the high rates of change and a sense of personal vulnerability which may not have arisen if not for Covid,” she said. “We are also finding it increasingly challenging to entice casual relief teachers to our schools.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Earlier this month, a Covid outbreak at Queanbeyan high school forced students to return to some days of remote learning. Staff at the school walked out on Thursday in protest over what they said was a lack of support from the NSW Department of Education in staffing the school. “It’s not just because of Covid, however, Covid is just making it worse,” one said. A teacher at nearby Karabar high, who wished to remain anonymous, told Guardian Australia their school had sent a letter to parents advising them of staffing shortages, and three Queanbeyan primary schools had also been forced to send cohorts home due to outbreaks. A NSW Department of Education spokesperson said a “high number of staff” had been absent from a number of schools due to local case spikes, and that schools were remaining as “flexible as possible” by adopting a hybrid model of delivering classes. Guidelines for backfilling staff released by the NSW health department recommend the use of casual teachers to manage Covid disruptions, including teachers from nearby schools and department-accredited staff in non-teaching roles. As of 14 March, more than 350 non-teaching corporate staff had been deployed into schools and 1,799 final year teaching students were granted interim teaching approval for casual and temporary roles. The department has also begun contacting retired teaches to consider casual or temporary work in response to the shortages.",News/Australia news,Rising Covid cases force some schools in NSW and Victoria to return to remote learning,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/25/rising-covid-cases-force-some-schools-in-nsw-and-victoria-to-return-to-remote-learning
3/26/2022,"Kyiose Han did not know where to go when his brother kicked him out of home two years ago. Aged 17 at the time, Han, an orphan, had only recently arrived in Australia from Myanmar. He had no job, no money and knew very little English. “I was lost, I didn’t know where to go,” he said. “I didn’t know what to do, I just felt terrible, it was a real struggle.” He reached out to a case worker at an intensive English centre who scrambled to find him crisis accomodation. “I was very scared, what if I couldn’t find anything? I was newly arrived, I didn’t have any other relatives here, I didn’t know anyone, I was only 17. “And at the time, I didn’t feel supported at all, I wasn’t receiving Centrelink or anything. If there was no crisis accomodation, I would’ve been on the street.” Han was able to eventually find accomodation for six weeks, before landing a job at an aged care facility. While he has stable accommodation in Sydney now, his experience is not a unique one. A survey of 100 asylum seekers conducted by Jesuit Refugee Services (JRS) Australia and Western Sydney University’s Translational Health Research Institute found they were at considerable risk of homelessness. Over half of the respondents had experienced some form of homelessness since arriving in Australia, with just under 10% of saying they had slept rough, in a car, or in another improvised dwelling. A youth worker from a major charity in Sydney, who asked to be anonymous, told Guardian Australia they had recently made a compassionate exemption for a recently arrived migrant who was living on the street to stay at a crisis accomodation facility. “He’s extremely vulnerable, he’s got some significant mental health issues, he has a serious lack of any support – financial, emotional or social,” the youth worker said. “And because he’s a migrant, there are even more disadvantages he’s experiencing, with English as a second language and an unfamiliarity with the system. “If we hadn’t intervened, he would have likely ended up significantly harming himself or being significantly harmed by someone else.” According to the youth worker, without knowledge of the services that exist and familiarity of the processes, refugees, asylum seekers and recently arrived migrants could easily fall through the cracks. Visa restrictions also limit migrants’ and asylum seekers’ capacity to work or to claim government financial support. “So what is happening is they just make enough just to rent within an overcrowded shared living space,” said the youth worker. “There are a lot of barriers in terms of trying to support clients or a demographic like this out of homelessness, because of the systemic barriers to employment, services, and government benefits.” The JRS survey highlighted the extent of the challenges facing asylum seekers, with just under half of the respondents saying they had run out of food in the previous three months and couldn’t afford more. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It also reflected the many ways the pandemic exacerbated these challenges, with just under a third reporting they had been evicted in 2020 despite the state government’s moratorium on evictions. 17% of respondents said they had experienced homelessness over multiple years, and one in four said the conditions of their housing made them feel “miserable, anxious or depressed”. Nishadh Rego, the policy, advocacy, and communications manager at the Jesuit Refugee Service, said the report highlighted the precariousness of housing for asylum seekers. “Despite the fact that these individuals are still going through the Refugee Status Determination process and may remain in Australia for years, many are issued bridging visas without work rights and/or study rights, leaving them in precarious situations, and in some cases, pushing people to return to situations of danger,” he said. “People seeking asylum, including those who are demonstrably unable to work for mental or even physical health reasons or to find work, are also not eligible for any form of Centrelink benefit. “Without such a safety net, people are inevitably vulnerable to chronic housing insecurity or homelessness.” Rego said pandemic restrictions, particularly the tough restrictions imposed on some of the most diverse suburbs in Sydney, had particularly affected asylum seekers. “Excluded from jobseeker and jobkeeper support payments, people seeking asylum were often the first to lose their jobs or have hours reduced as the economic downturn struck. “The economic downturn associated with prolonged lockdown measures has meant many more of those who were working in hospitality, security, food production/delivery, and retail lost their jobs, and may not have regained them.” Rego said that as long as the federal government continues to withhold economic and social support, “the underlying root causes will remain”.",News/Australia news,‘I was lost’: Kyiose faced homelessness after arriving in Australia from Myanmar – and he’s not alone ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/26/i-was-lost-kyiose-faced-homelessness-after-arriving-in-australia-from-myanmar-and-hes-not-alone
3/26/2022,"It was purely coincidence that on Friday morning two ministers in the New South Wales government appeared at the opening of a new $341m hospital in Concord alongside the Drummoyne MP John Sidoti. But the timing was fascinating. Sidoti is currently under investigation by the state’s Independent Commission Against Corruption. A former minister in Gladys Berejiklian’s government, he moved to the crossbench when the watchdog revealed the terms of its investigation in March last year. In a normal parliamentary term, it would have been a death knell. Sidoti maintains his innocence, of course, but as a host of former MPs will tell you (often while privately advocating for the watchdog to be brought to heel) an Icac investigation rarely bodes well for the target’s career prospects. But into the fourth year of the third term of this Coalition government, Sidoti’s star is rising once again. Why? Because this week another of Berejiklian’s former ministers, Gareth Ward, was charged by NSW police over allegations of sexual abuse against a man and a 17-year-old boy dating back several years. Ward moved to the crossbench in May after he revealed he was the subject of a police investigation. He has denied the allegations and indicated he will be fighting the charges. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But after the charges were laid on Tuesday he was quickly given an ultimatum by premier Dominic Perrottet: resign or face a motion that would “remove him from the parliament”. What exactly he meant by “remove” became the subject of some dispute. By the next day the government was making a half-hearted attempt to claim the premier had not been suggesting Ward would be expelled from the parliament. That isn’t true. Legal advice sought on Tuesday night makes clear the government had been considering expelling the MP, but was warned doing so posed a “significant risk” to the criminal case against him. It’s also understood significant angst was emanating from the Coalition backbench over the precedent that an expulsion motion would be set in circumstances where an MP had not been convicted of a crime. So, Ward was suspended, meaning he can no longer attend the parliamentary precinct or visit schools. The government argues the suspension means Ward effectively stops acting as an MP for his electorate of Kiama. He disagrees, and issued a statement shortly after the motion passed saying he would “continue to represent and lobby for my local community”. In any case, he can no longer attend parliament to vote on bills, which matters for the premier as he attempts to guide his minority government to an election in 12 months. Although the premier has a supply deal with three independent MPs, the government has often relied on both Ward and Sidoti to pass its legislation. The former voted with the government 23 times in divisions after he stood aside in May, and the government had been cautious about alienating him before the charges were laid this week. Their unofficial buffer became more crucial after the government lost the seat of Bega in February’s byelection. In February, the health minister, Brad Hazzard, responding to a question from Ward in parliament, called him “an incredible advocate for his local community”. As a former minister Ward had been an “extraordinary contributor to this place, the broader state and his local community”, he said. “Let that be clearly on the record.” While Ward had friends and enemies on both sides of the aisle, the eagerness to keep him on side could come back to bite the government. This week the NSW upper house passed a motion seeking all ministerial communication with the MP in the 10 months since he moved to the crossbench. It could make for uncomfortable reading. But back to Sidoti, whose vote has also been crucial, but less certain. In December, Labor tried to block a bill which wound back pandemic-era workers’ compensation laws. After negotiating with the Drummoyne MP, the opposition was hopeful, only for him to eventually take the government’s side. It’s widely understood that was after an agreement for funding in his electorate. The bill passed by one vote. But Ward’s removal makes the numbers even tighter. This week Labor, with the support of the crossbench, managed to pass a procedural motion allowing it to suspend standing and sessional orders and disrupt government business. This is inside baseball – but the fact they were able to get it up is an early sign of the new challenges facing the Coalition. Which makes the timing of Friday’s hospital visit so interesting. Sidoti is the local MP and has a good relationship with Hazzard, so would have received an invite regardless of this week’s events. But it’s certainly the first time in recent months that the government has advertised a public appearance with him. And Sidoti is not shy about the way he views parliament after being cast away from the Liberal party. In the lead up to the December vote, the number of MPs popping in to visit for the first time since the Icac drama broke was not lost on Sidoti. After spending so long in the wilderness, if the government wants his support, it will need to win it by stumping up for his electorate. There is another element to this precarious numbers game. For months the NSW Liberal party has been in conflict over federal preselections. The dispute may come to a head soon, with the possibility of a broad federal intervention still live. Caught up in that long-running dispute is the MP for Holsworthy, Melanie Gibbons, who has indicated she may quit politics if she is unsuccessful in gaining preselection for the federal seat of Hughes. Either option is terrible for Perrottet – and much work is being done behind the scenes to stop it from happening – because this government needs another byelection like it needs a hole in the head. There are also rumours swirling that another senior NSW MP has indicated an interest in running in the federal seat of Parramatta.",Global,"With numbers falling, the NSW government needs all the support it can get",https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/mar/26/with-numbers-falling-the-nsw-government-needs-all-the-support-it-can-get
3/26/2022,"When Bill Shorten parachuted Kimberley Kitching into parliament in 2016, she was no darling of conservatives. Kitching’s selection was derided by the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, as a “captain’s call”. The Liberal senator Eric Abetz labelled her “unfit for public office” over adverse findings made by the Fair Work Commission and trade union royal commission. But over her six-year Senate career, Kitching won respect from conservatives for her advocacy on human rights, hawkish stance on China and a successful push for Australia to adopt Magnitsky-style sanctions laws. Kitching’s sudden death of a suspected heart attack aged 52 prompted an outpouring of grief but also political backbiting, fuelled by Shorten’s observation that “the stress of politics and the machinations in the back rooms had its toll” on her. Now the recriminations for alleged bullying and lack of action to prevent it are being weaponised by the Morrison government ahead of the May election and within Labor. Shorten’s insinuation – that a back-room push to replace Kitching may have played a part in her death – was amplified by long-time ally and Health Workers Union secretary, Diana Asmar, who noted in the News Corp tabloids last weekend that three right-faction figures had failed to back her in a meeting the day before her death. On one view, these are just the genuine expressions of grief from those closest to “Kimba”. Others claim they are being used to bolster support for a discredited faction whose branch stacking triggered the national executive to take over the Victorian branch. Attributing ill-health to particular events is absurd given the stresses of politics in general, some say. “They all play hard – all of them,” one Labor operative said. “They’re all vicious to each other. Factional politics destroys your career and puts you in the grave early. I’ve seen many people’s health take a massive nose dive as soon as they enter parliament.” Kitching was born in Brisbane and became a friend of Shorten’s wife, Chloe, in childhood. She studied law and was admitted as a solicitor before moving to the private sector and serving on Melbourne city council. Kitching was married to Andrew Landeryou, who fled overseas in 2004 just days before he was due in court to explain his role in the collapse of the University of Melbourne Student Union. Landeryou insisted he did nothing wrong and answered questions from liquidators after he was arrested on his return. Kitching was later declared bankrupt after Solomon Lew pursued a debt for $3m arising from Landeryou’s dealings with him. The bankruptcy was later annulled. Landeryou was also notorious in Melbourne for running the blog Vexnews – a mix of news and scandal-sheet targeting enemies of the Victorian right – and for shenanigans including vandalising Green and Liberal polling material in Melbourne Ports in a bid to help re-elect the Labor MP Michael Danby. Within Victorian Labor, people’s view of Kitching in large part depended on whether they held her responsible for Landeryou’s blog. On one view, she was complicit: the “good cop” to Landeryou’s “bad”, but every bit as much the factional animal. On the other, she couldn’t be blamed for the carry-on and invective. When the Health Services Union (No 1 branch, now the HWU) needed to be cleaned up after the fraud and mismanagement of Kathy Jackson, Asmar, as secretary, and Kitching, as general manager, took over the branch in 2012. The Fair Work Commission found that in the course of filling roles at the union, Kitching unlawfully completed right-of-entry tests on behalf of others. Kitching denied the allegation. Her denial was rejected by both the commission and the trade union royal commission, which recommended she be charged for false statements about the incident, although charges were never laid. For many years the Victorian right operated under a stability pact between Bill Shorten’s faction and that of the former senator Stephen Conroy and the deputy leader, Richard Marles. In late 2017 and early 2018, that was upended by a new alignment spearheaded by Adem Somyurek, a former minister in the Daniel Andrews state government, Kitching and Landeryou, but opposed by Marles. Somyurek was increasingly dominant in the Victorian branch before an explosive investigation by the Age and 60 Minutes in mid-2020 into allegations of branch-stacking triggered a federal takeover and an Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission probe. Some downplay the extent of Kitching’s factional activities, noting although she was on the Victorian Labor party’s admin committee for 10 years, she didn’t control delegates in her own right. On this view, her political career was a result of her close personal friendship with Shorten, who added Australian Workers Union numbers to the shoppies, the industrial left and Somyurek’s numbers to bring her to Canberra despite two earlier unsuccessful preselection attempts. On one account Shorten blindsided colleagues by insisting Kitching was not a candidate until the last day for nominations, using that emerging grouping and Somyurek’s growing influence to strong-arm the rest of the party to accept her as the replacement for Conroy’s Senate vacancy in 2016. A spokesman for Shorten said he “doesn’t agree with that characterisation” and the sudden decision was more a function of Conroy’s abrupt departure. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, reportedly resisted the appointment by threatening to resign. The then frontbench MP Anthony Albanese delicately criticised Shorten’s call, one of the few instances he publicly differentiated himself from the then Labor leader. Dreyfus changed his tune, later defending the appointment. He responded to a question about Landeryou’s factional influence behind the scenes by saying it would be unreasonable to criticise Kitching as “a female politician because of the actions of her husband”, suggesting there were “echoes of Trump in that”. In November 2021, Somyurek testified to the Victorian Ibac that he suggested a factional ally access the electoral roll via Kitching’s office, as this could gain access to the entire Victorian roll. Somyurek said this was “common practice” to access a “generic database” in a senator’s office, and it never crossed his mind that this defeated a safeguard that MPs only had access to the roll in their area. After the national executive took over the Victorian branch to purge it of branch-stacked members, Asmar headed to the Victorian supreme court and the court of appeal to challenge the intervention on the basis it infringed members’ right to preselect candidates. After losing in those forums in October last year and February 2022, Asmar and a group of Victorian unions this week sought to take the case to the high court, which will require leave to appeal. Kitching cultivated a wide network of foreign policy and defence sources as she pursued goals including the Magnitsky laws – unsuccessfully pushed by Danby in the previous parliament – and tougher lines against China and in favour of Israel within Labor. Danby, the former member for Melbourne Ports and a mentor of Kitching, told Guardian Australia she represented the “Hawke-Beazley foreign policy tradition”. Kitching had “political instincts for the mainstream” which were more in tune with the majority of Australians, he said. “There were real differences in policy over China,” he told Sky News. “She was a fighter for those views.” The claim that Kitching was bullied focuses on incidents including the Labor Senate leader, Penny Wong, telling her “if you had children, you might understand why there is a climate emergency” and Kitching being dropped from the tactics committee after allegedly tipping off Linda Reynolds about Labor’s plan to weaponise Brittany Higgins’s complaint against the government. Kitching wrote a seven-page letter to Labor’s deputy Senate leader, Kristina Keneally, denying having forewarned Reynolds and claiming she had no prior knowledge of the Higgins complaint. Danby claims this means the allegation had been “debunked” but Reynolds stands by the claim. In his eulogy for Kitching, Landeryou told mourners on Monday that “the unpleasantness” Kitching experienced from a “cantankerous cabal” inside the parliamentary party and outside it “did baffle and hurt her”. Landeryou said he did not blame “any one person, or any one meeting, or any campaign of unpleasantness” for her death and was angry he “didn’t meddle enough in her health”. “I’m angry I failed and failed again to persuade her to slow down, I’m angry I couldn’t and didn’t protect her from menace – and I fear I attracted some,” he said. Wong, Keneally and the shadow finance minister, Katy Gallagher, have denied bullying Kitching. Wong apologised to Kitching for the comment, which she explained on Saturday wasn’t meant “to personally attack her” but rather “to express the distress that many children feel about climate change”. Kitching spoke to Marles asking for the decision to drop her from the tactics committee to be reversed. But Albanese said she didn’t make a formal complaint of bullying to him or the party’s independent process. “From time to time, people are removed or replaced or stood aside from tactics committees and they go back on,” the Labor leader told ABC TV this week, rejecting suggestions this amounted to bullying. Kitching remained a shadow assistant minister – responsible for the NDIS and government services – until her death, despite losing the role of shadow assistant for government accountability. The widespread outpouring of grief confirmed Kitching’s wide network of influence in the media and across the political divide. Many journalists mourned her loss as a friend and conservatives from the defence minister, Peter Dutton, to Liberal vice-president Teena McQueen claimed to have personal insight into her struggles in Labor. Others appeared to out her as a source for stories suggesting Labor could be weak on China. Danby said claims Kitching undermined Labor’s position on China “doesn’t justify the whole package of cruel treatment and it doesn’t justify her complaints not being passed on”. Shorten used Kitching’s funeral on Monday to urge the party to “channel their grief” into winning the upcoming federal election. “She understood – in the marrow of her bones – that the people who count on Labor count, above all, on Labor government,” Shorten said. On Friday, he stressed that “at no point” had he advocated for an inquiry into the bullying claims and he “accepted the decision of the Labor leadership on this”. Earlier in the week, Danby said Kitching was “no weakling” but she was “owed justice” – suggesting an inquiry couple help answer questions like “whether Richard Marles passed Kimberley’s complaints on as he should have”. “There were terrible things done to Kimberley beyond political faction heavying by the Lilliputians … here in Victoria,” he told Sky, in reference to efforts by the Labor right to purge the branch of the influence of Somyurek’s faction. Danby said that nobody blamed factional operatives in Victoria nor “the power group in Canberra” for her death but “it certainly increased her stress”. Danby told Guardian Australia the party could win the election and establish an independent inquiry into her treatment. On the eve of the official campaign, Scott Morrison seized on Kitching and her allies’ allegations as a means to paint Albanese as soft on “bullies” in his party and the region – meaning China. Labor’s national executive met on Wednesday to open nominations to fill Kitching’s Senate vacancy with a ballot to be contested on Tuesday. Current contenders include the Victorian corrections minister, Natalie Hutchins, the former Kooyong candidate and public servant Jana Stewart, and the barrister and former Higgins candidate Fiona McLeod. Kitching’s allies are backing Hutchins, and while few would dispute the Victorian minister’s talent, some are upset at the way Kitching’s death has been used to leverage factional influence to choose her replacement. Danby rejects this claim, arguing it would be “sordid”. “You always have to be careful that there is no winner take all in politics – otherwise the divisions in the right will outlast many of our lifetimes,” said one operative.",News/Australia news,‘They all play hard’: what happened when Kimberley Kitching came to Canberra?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/26/they-all-play-hard-what-happened-when-kimberley-kitching-came-to-canberra
3/26/2022,"At the Darwin Community Legal Centre, the staff are concerned about what’s to come for some of the most vulnerable people in the Territory. Jessica Brugmans, the senior advocate at the centre’s Seniors and Disability Rights Service, says that over the past 12 months there has been a “general trend of substantial cuts to funding” in National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) plans. Often, those cuts have come in “ways that aren’t easily linked to an event or change in available evidence”. It has forced people to move out of their accomodation and seen them become increasingly isolated due to reduced staff to participant ratios. In Alice Springs, the chief executive of the Disability Advocacy Service, Adrian Scholtes, says the service is also receiving increased reports of reductions to plans. “This started for DAS around October and … continues at this stage,” he says. NDIS participants have their funding packages reviewed from time to time and, as the agency that runs the scheme often says, funding can go up or down. But across the country, participants are increasingly complaining that their packages are going down, not up. As Guardian Australia has reported, the number of legal appeals has skyrocketed, so much so that advocacy organisations are unable to take new clients. The problem has been labelled a “crisis” by NT-based legal groups in a recent letter to the federal government pleading for more funding. Indeed, it is in the Northern Territory where the national disability insurance agency’s apparent shift in approach is having a disproportionate effect. New data provided to a parliamentary committee shows that in the NT, half (51%) of all NDIS participants who had their plan reviewed in the last six months of 2021 had their plan cut by more than 5%. The same measure in other jurisdictions comes in at about a third. The figures showed that of the other reviews in the NT, 17% saw the funding stay within 5% of the original plan, and 32% of the time it increased by 5% or more. While the NDIA data only measures the proportion of plans cut by more than 5%, Brugman says some of the centre’s clients are facing funding reductions of 20%, 50% or 60%. One NDIS provider in the territory, meanwhile, says 95% of its participants had seen cuts to their plans in the past 12 months. Another provider working in remote communities reports cuts to transport budgets, meals and support work services. In some cases, those cuts are coming as a shock. Brugmans claims sometimes participants are not getting to have a full discussion with an NDIA representative about their needs. Instead, there is a “quick phone call”, and then the new plan comes back reduced. When advocates like Brugmans follow up, she says the agency gives reasons like that the supports requested are not “value for money” – citing section 34(1)(c) of the NDIS Act – or that they’re a “parental responsibility under the NDIS Act”. “The NDIA has also cited the financial sustainability of the Scheme in outcome letters,” Brugmans says. The government insists there is no edict to reduce funding packages. An NDIA spokesperson says that the 51% of reduced plans in the Northern Territory related to 1,232 plan reviews, compared to some 72,000 in NSW over the same period. It was “therefore based [on] a proportionally low count of plan reviews, and overall participants, when compared to other jurisdictions”. There are 4,587 NDIS participants in the Northern Territory, a fraction of the 500,000 across the country. The demographics are very different: 41% live in a remote area (Alice Springs and Katherine are considered remote); 50% are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. The cost of providing services in the NT is higher than other areas, meaning NDIS participants in the territory generally have larger budgets than the national average. At the same, participants in some parts of the NT are far less likely to use their funding, due to an issue known as “thin markets”, which is essentially a lack of available services. “People are not spending what’s in their package, so when the review comes around [it’s cut],” says June Riemer, the deputy executive officer at First Peoples Disability Network. “This is how the system works… ‘You obviously don’t need $10,000 in transport because you’ve only spent $2,000’. But no one is looking at the systemic issues.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning What this means, in effect, says Riemer, is that the government is saving money from participants who are not able to access the services they need in their communities. The NDIA, however, denies that plan decisions are based “on utilisation in previous plans”. Robyne Burridge, the NT’s Senior Australian of the Year for her work as a disability advocate, says incentives are needed to attract people to work in remote areas. “It’s so difficult to get services out there,” says Burridge. Where the services are available, participants and their families may face a language barrier, adds Brugmans. Lawson Broad is the chief executive of Somerville Community Services, which provides supported independent living (Sil) services in Darwin, Katherine and Alice Springs. Sil packages are generally the most expensive in the NDIS because they provide significant help throughout the day, seven days a week, including overnight support. Many, though not all, Sil participants have an intellectual disability. Broad says 95% of his 65 Sil participants have seen their funding cut in the past 12 months. About 80% of those participants are First Nations people from remote communities who have moved to larger population centres to get those services. “The average cuts are over 10% but we are seeing cuts over 25% for some participants,” Broad says. “This means that less disability support workers are being funded to assist someone to live as independently as possible.” Participants are seeing staff to participant ratios cut, while overnight support is being changed to “sleepover shifts”, he says. Mick Fallon, the NT manager at provider peak body National Disability Services, notes there can “good reasons” why a plan is reduced. “They may have received really good support which means support needs reduce over time,” he says. “But there are plenty of people for whom disability becomes a greater concern as they age.” At the pointy end, Brugmans says the impact of cuts to Sil packages can be dramatic. “A person may have to move out of their current Sil accommodation because new supports may not reflect the support ratios of that house,” she says. In other cases, people can become “increasingly isolated as the new, insufficient levels of support do not allow for community participation”. “A person may have to consider hospital admission to ensure their safety, as the NDIS plan does not provide appropriate, safe, levels of care.” The NDIA spokesperson says average annualised plan budgets for NT Sil participants had increased by “58% for those participants who were on their third plan and 29% for those on their fourth plan”. That was from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2021, covering the period before many services had started to report cuts to packages.",News/Australia news,Half of all NDIS plans reviewed in the NT had funding slashed over last six months,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/26/half-of-all-ndis-plans-reviewed-in-the-nt-had-funding-slashed-over-last-six-months
3/26/2022,"The government must end the “moral and financial black hole” on Nauru by ceasing its contract with Canstruct and returning those on Nauru to Australia in the wake of the New Zealand refugee resettlement deal, human rights groups say. Asked on Friday whether it would end the Canstruct contract for “garrison and welfare services”, the government declined to answer. The vast majority of those on Nauru – there are little over 100 people currently on the island – are now on a pathway to a third country. The Guardian also understands the New Zealand deal to resettle 150 refugees each year, for three years, will prioritise those on Nauru. Canstruct’s contract is due to expire in June, but the Department of Home Affairs will not say whether the contract will be extended – at a likely cost of hundreds of millions of dollars – until all resettlements are complete. The contract has so far cost taxpayers more than $1.8bn after repeated extensions. The last extension, which funded Canstruct’s work from January to June, cost taxpayers $218m. Amnesty International’s refugee coordinator, Graham Thom, said there was now little sense in continuing to extend the contract, given almost all of those still on Nauru would be resettled in third countries. He said they should instead be returned to Australia while the resettlement process continued. “Given that these people, the vast majority now, are on a pathway to a third country, we don’t know why they need to be kept on Nauru,” Thom told the Guardian. “It seems rather pointless to increase the suffering for those people who voluntarily put up their hands to go somewhere else … why do you need to keep them on Nauru at great expense, when the plan is to ultimately mothball the centre anyway?” Government figures suggest it is costing the Australian taxpayer more than $4m each year to hold a single refugee or asylum seeker on Nauru, or nearly $12,000 a day. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Canstruct was awarded the Nauru contract initially via a “letter of intent” worth $8m, and was then given contracts via limited tender. The contract has repeatedly been amended to extend the company’s work on Nauru. Government figures show eight further non-competitive amendments to the contract, raising the total cost to $1.82bn. Last month, the Guardian revealed that Canstruct, via its holding company, had made a $101m profit in 2020-21 – more than $500,000 for each of the fewer than 200 people held on the island. Despite the New Zealand deal, the Australian government has signalled it sees a deterrent value in maintaining an “enduring regional processing capability” on Nauru, signing an opaque memorandum of understanding with the Nauru government late last year.

The home affairs department said its deal with New Zealand “does not signal a change in government’s border protection policies”. “The Australian government remains committed to regional processing as a key element of its response to maritime people smuggling through Operation Sovereign,” a spokesperson said. The spokesman said the new arrangement with Nauru will require “regional processing contracts in Nauru” to remain in place. “On 10 December 2021, the Department released a Limited Tender on AusTender titled, Facilities, Garrison, Transferee Arrivals and Reception Services in the Republic of Nauru.” “The Department is undertaking a Limited Tender to multiple entities for enduring regional processing capability.” Senator Jacqui Lambie revealed this week that she had struck a deal with the government to accept the New Zealand resettlement offer when negotiating her support to repeal the medevac legislation in 2019. The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre advocacy director, Jana Favero, said it was “outrageous” that the contract kept being extended, despite the government knowing refugees on Nauru would be resettled to New Zealand. Echoing Amnesty’s calls, Favero urged the government to bring those on Nauru to Australia while they were being resettled, allowing it to cancel the Canstruct contract. “The cost, the harm, the lack of services has been well-documented, so in the face of the New Zealand deal, it shows us it was even more ridiculous,” she said. “It begs the question why doesn’t the government, knowing the New Zealand deal will go ahead, knowing that most people will be transferred to New Zealand, why they’re not just being brought to Australia before that happens. “It’s a moral and financial black hole.” Canstruct declined to comment, citing contractual obligations.

3/26/2022,"Maddie Jones lives in Sydney’s inner west and each day she updates a spreadsheet of Covid cases in her area. The 51-year-old avoids certain places – or going out altogether – when numbers are high. Hiti de Kretser, 41, lives in Prahran in Melbourne’s inner south-east. This week she missed her uncle’s funeral, deeming the risk of catching Covid too great. At-risk Australians across the country are increasingly worried due to growing case numbers of the BA.2 subvariant of Omicron and the incoming approach of winter with very few health restrictions remaining. Cancer patients, transplant recipients, people on immunosuppressive drugs and other vulnerable members of the public are stuck in a perpetual lockdown as the rest of the country tries to forget it is still in the thick of a pandemic. There are roughly 500,000 “severely immunocompromised” Australians across the country, according to the federal health department. Either disease or medication has weakened their immune system and they are more vulnerable to getting severely sick or dying if they catch Covid. The vaccines offer less protection, and some of them are being encouraged to have their fourth dose now before winter begins. The Department of Health would not provide the exact numbers of how many people have had their fourth dose. “Immunocompromised individuals who have received three primary doses of a Covid-19 vaccine are also recommended to have a booster dose in line with the timing for the general population,” it said. Maddie Jones has had her fourth shot. She said her spreadsheet “is a bit silly” but she needs to track the virus. She has rheumatoid arthritis and takes drugs that suppress her immune system. The last time she got a common cold it went for six weeks and while she doesn’t think Covid will kill her, it could take her months to recover. “If a cold can put me out for six weeks, what the fuck is Covid going to do to me?” Jones lives alone, only goes to the shops once a week, and always wears an N95 mask. If she is seeing a friend, they will meet outside. “From my perspective, it’s work where it becomes an issue,” she said. Her employee has asked her to come in two days a week. She said it’s “not a big ask” but is nervous about what that might mean for her exposure. “I just don’t need to get it. It’s not going to be fun or in any way OK. It’s a bad deal for me and people like me.” Millions more Australians are in high-risk categories – they have asthma, high blood pressure, or are simply over 70. For some, the worry of catching Covid does not impinge on enjoying freedoms they haven’t had consistently for two years – while others are forced to live careful lives, waiting out the pandemic. Prof Mike Toole, the deputy director of the Burnet Institute, said there are about 200 conditions that could render someone at high risk – and that the best protection is the vaccine. “Fourth doses have been shown to be quite effective,” Toole said. “In normal people, with a normal immune system, a fourth dose doesn’t add much protection, it just brings it back to the same level of the third, but in immunocompromised people it brings it up quite dramatically.” Even with a fourth dose though, those at high risk should take precautions, he said. “Always wear high-quality respirator mask indoors and avoid crowded settings. Doing all the things we know work to prevent Covid,” Toole said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “That’s tough. A lot of people interpret that as staying at home. “I would encourage people to spend a lot of time outdoors, you don’t have to be locked up inside. Eat at an outdoor table, and make sure you have a mask on all the time except [when] eating and drinking.” Another woman, who lives in Melbourne but did not want to be named because there had been tension in the family over Covid-safe behaviour, said she had celebrated her birthday with one friend, in the back yard, with a fan blowing air away from her. “It pervades everything,” she said. She described how if she went out to the park or to meet someone at a cafe it had to be close to home, so she did not have to use the toilet. There’s a new baby in her family and she has not been able to hold it. “Not being able to give a two-year-old a hug. It makes me so sad,” she said. Last week, Covid Live data showed cases had jumped 37% because of the more transmissible variant. While a lot of people have stopped checking the daily numbers, many immunocompromised Australians still count cases. De Kretser lives with her husband and daughter. They’re missing big family events, including her uncle’s funeral and her sister’s birthday party, and for her own 40th, she stayed at home. She has been to a restaurant twice in the last 12 months. “It was at 5pm in the afternoon and sitting outside,” she said. “It feels like a double blow – if you were feeling OK, and up for doing something, then you can’t because of the possibility of what can happen. “It’s permanent lockdown.” It affects her daughter’s life, too. Her cousins aren’t vaccinated so they have shorter play dates where it used to be sleepovers. She can go to parties, but only when the kids have had their shots. De Kretser says the rhetoric around opening up, living with the virus feels isolating. “I feel forgotten,” she said. For some, though, it’s not a story of isolation, but of connectedness. Claire Kearns, 42, has an invisible disability that makes leaving the house difficult. While Covid poses a threat to her health, it has also supercharged her social life. In 2018, she started her master’s degree. She was put on an access plan which meant she was meant to be zoomed in to lectures. “They decided they didn’t know how to Zoom, so instead they were going to call me. I ended up on a loudspeaker on a lecturer’s phone,” she said. The lecturers would forget to call her, leaving Kearns at home with no way of accessing her class. “Then the pandemic broke and my world changed,” she said. “ I could see and talk to other people. It was the happiest I’ve been.” Now the world is opening up, Kearns wants the positive things about the pandemic – the way it has allowed us to easily work, learn and play online – to stay in place as an option for people like her. “I see two people in my day. That’s it. That’s what I’ve gone back to. During the pandemic I was in seminars with 20 people, I was in group projects. “Everyone needs a social life and some of us find it harder to get one,” she said. “I would like to see people remember.”",News/Australia news,Australians with the most to fear from Omicron living in ‘permanent lockdown’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/26/australians-with-the-most-to-fear-from-omicron-living-in-permanent-lockdown
3/26/2022,"A week ago, the Victorian opposition was quietly confident. After struggling to gain any political momentum amid the pandemic, the opposition leader, Matthew Guy’s consistent and disciplined messaging on the triple-zero call response crisis appeared to be cutting through. Coalition MPs had hit the road to win over voters with promises of road upgrades, new sports and community facilities, and plans to rebuild piers. Former opposition leader, Michael O’Brien, returned to the frontbench, bringing much-needed experience to the shadow attorney general position. According to internal polling, the party was in the most competitive position it had been in for some time, Guardian Australia was told. Some MPs even saw the result of the South Australia election – a Labor landslide – as a positive sign ahead of the Victorian poll in November. Labor leader, Peter Malinauskas, campaigned relentlessly on health: Guy planned to do the same. But where this sitting week was meant to be spent hammering the government on triple-zero delays, ambulance ramping and the state’s lengthy elective surgery waitlist, Guy was instead defending his own party. The opposition’s whole week was a spectacular own-goal. On Monday, the opposition backflipped on its plans to scrap the government’s mental health and wellbeing levy, which targets businesses that pay more than $10m in wages and is forecast to raise $843m each year to fund services. Bizarrely, the shadow treasurer, David Davis, and opposition mental health spokesperson, Emma Kealy, denied the Coalition had ever said it would dump the levy if elected. Guy was forced to hold an evening press conference, during which he conceded the party’s position had indeed changed, blaming the state’s battered budget. On Tuesday, Guy left parliament before question time to get a Covid PCR test. A day earlier he had told reporters he had been feeling unwell since Saturday. But it didn’t stop him from attending Victorian senator Kimberley Kitching’s funeral and several other events at the weekend, including a multicultural gala with 1500 people on Saturday night. Also at the gala was Davis, who was forced to apologise after The Age on Wednesday revealed he was so intoxicated he had to be escorted out by his fellow MPs. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a subsequent report, the newspaper alleged Davis swore at staff at a regional brewery after it had run out of the squid dish he ordered and he was told a glass of wine he wanted could only be ordered by the bottle. Safe to say a wine-tasting fundraising event he was due to be co-hosting on Sunday was promptly cancelled. Then, to cap off the sitting week, Liberal MP Wendy Lovell told the upper house there is “no point” in having social housing in wealthy areas “where the children cannot mix with others”. “There is no point putting a very low income, probably welfare-dependent family in the best street in Brighton where the children cannot mix with others or go to the school with other children, or where they do not have the same ability to have the latest in sneakers and iPhones,” she said. Labor seized on Lovell’s comments, describing them as “postcode snobbery”. The premier used the opportunity to spruik a social housing project planned for the bayside suburb. As they say, a week is a long time in politics. This is one the opposition will quickly try to forget.",News/Australia news,A week of own-goals leaves Victoria’s opposition bruised,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/26/a-week-of-own-goals-leaves-victorias-opposition-bruised
3/26/2022,"If you happen to find yourself driving around Tasmania right at the moment, you’ll encounter an interesting sight. From Hobart in the south to Stanley in the far north-west of the state, there are large signs introducing a political candidate to the voters. This candidate’s name is Eric Abetz and, according to his signage, he “puts Tasmania first”. People who follow federal politics closely might scratch their heads at this, because engaged voters will already know this fellow. Abetz is a Liberal senator for Tasmania. He’s been in the chamber since 1994. He’s spanned the Keating, Howard, Rudd, Gillard, Rudd, Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments. He’s been a cabinet minister and leader of the government in the Senate. But the Abetz of the roadside signs has no visible party affiliation. Perhaps the navy blue text provides a suggestion. A glancing hint. But on the signs I’ve seen over the past week, there’s zero Liberal party branding. If you are a disengaged, low information voter, it’s possible you could conclude that Abetz is another fledgling political independent rather than a stalwart of the Liberal party who has kicked around major party politics since his youth, when he was a national president of the Australian Liberal Students Federation. I’m not from Tasmania, so forgive me if there’s an inflection or a nuance here that I’m missing, but locals tell me there’s a distinct north-south identity in the state – which is a microcosm of the north-south identity of the mainland. Northern Tasmanians say the veteran Liberal senator isn’t as well known in their communities as he is in Hobart. It’s also pretty clear, if you talk to people, that a lot of voters in the north feel very removed from all the shenanigans in Canberra. There is also palpable disaffection with the major parties from Launceston right through to the remote north-west. Being branded a Liberal isn’t necessarily a plus. Having mapped the what, let’s move to the why – why is Abetz grinning at passing motorists in what appears to be a guerrilla political campaign a couple of weeks out from the official federal election contest? The backstory is simple. The conservative stalwart was expected to take the prized No 1 spot on the Liberal Senate ticket for the coming election even though he’s no longer on the frontbench. It was widely speculated that Abetz and “Jonno” Duniam (currently a junior minister in the Morrison government) would take the top two positions on the ticket, with Wendy Askew in third. But there was an upset. Abetz was relegated to the third spot after Duniam and Askew. It’s not impossible to win from that position, but it is hard. People who know Abetz say he has no intention of bowing out quietly. So he’s running a below-the-line campaign to maximise his chances of remaining in the Senate. I’ve heard this week he is is telling people this political offensive is very much a community-driven thing – his supporters are rallying to his cause. But if Ericmentum is organic, it has clear institutional tendencies. Abetz signage is currently dotted at regular intervals in prominent locations on people’s properties right along Tasmania’s main roads. Readers on the mainland may not be aware that Tasmanians like to vote below the line. Some have a tendency to get behind grassroots insurrections rather than accede to the will of the faceless men and women who preselect major party candidates. Most recently, when Liberal Richard Colbeck was demoted to fifth on the Liberal ticket, and the Labor senator Lisa Singh was demoted to sixth on her party’s ticket, both ran below-the-line campaigns. Singh triumphed in the double-dissolution election of 2016, becoming the first candidate to be elected on below-the-line votes since the above and below the line system was introduced in 1984. Colbeck also picked up a significant chunk of the vote, but lost in 2016. He returned to the Senate in 2017 after his colleague Stephen Parry exited during the section 44 fracas. The ABC’s election analyst, Antony Green, says 27% of Tasmanians voted below the line at the last federal election – that’s about four times the rate as the rest of the country. “They’ve had 110 years of experience with Hare Clark, where you can pick and choose the candidates,” Green says, adding with a chuckle, “that’s why parties are always very cautious about demoting candidates in Tasmania”. I’m not sure whether a capital E establishment figure like Abetz has the necessary qualities to appeal to that outlaw spirit, but in any case, there will be fierce competition for the final Senate spot in Tasmania this time around. Jacqui Lambie – who has a high profile and name recognition in the north of the state, isn’t up for re-election in 2020. But the Jacqui Lambie Network is throwing most of its resources at the looming Senate contest. Lambie wants Tammy Tyrrell – a woman who has worked behind the scenes with her for years – to join her in the chamber in Canberra. Political strategists tell me Clive Palmer has now grabbed every available billboard in Tasmania, but Lambie has managed to nab the biggest one in the state – a whopper near a Bunnings store in Glenorchy on one of the main roads into Hobart. From their Hobart perch, Lambie and Tyrrell grin down at passing motorists as traffic flows into the city. Their faces also adorn trailers that can be moved around to catch passing commuters. The implicit message is these two women are two peas in a pod: if you like Jacqui (who you know) you’ll like Tammy, even though you don’t know her. Tyrrell thinks she’s in with a shot. “I don’t want to be cocky, but I think I’m doing OK,” she told me this week in Devonport. “I think we’ve done enough to show people there’s an alternative and Jacqui is not the only loud girl in town.” This Abetz versus Tyrrell vignette from Australia’s most southern state is just one of the really interesting Senate battles that will play out around the country between now and the middle of May. I should be clear that it’s not just Abetz and Tyrrell slugging it out in Tasmania. Leanne Minshull is running for the Local party. Some strategists also think the One Nation Senate candidate Steve Mav could be in the mix for the final spot because he has reasonable name recognition. Despite Tasmania’s high vaccination rates, there is some controversy in the community about mandates, and anti-vaxxers are looking for somewhere to park their votes. One person who knows the Tasmanian political scene well told me this week it was possible everybody was underestimating the United Australia party vote in the state because of that residual anger. We encountered one visual marker of this while driving past Oatlands. There’s a famous roadside bushranger sculpture in that part of the world. In the display, the bushranger is confronted by law enforcement. The enforcer at the moment is carrying a mocked-up syringe rather than a weapon.

It’s hard to say whether or not some of her base will punish her for that stance. It’s likely to be swings and roundabouts. Anti-vaxxers may park their votes elsewhere but it’s possible the network picks up votes from disaffected major party voters who affirm that position. Looking elsewhere, Palmer is making a run for the Senate in Queensland. Given the enormous resources the mining magnate has at his disposal, you’d have to consider him a chance. Nick Xenophon is also returning to the fray in South Australia after a bruising state election tilt in 2018 where his political operation crashed and burned. It’s entirely possible Xenophon is now yesterday’s man, but he has high name recognition with South Australian voters, and I suspect his attempted comeback will be welcome news to Lambie and Tyrrell in the event their Senate tilt succeeds. Political reporters have a tendency during elections to focus obsessively on various pathways to victory through marginal House of Representative seats because governments are formed in the lower house. But micro parties in the Senate all want the opportunity to be kingmakers because this maximises rates of the return to their constituents. In this context, the Senate battle is always interesting. Viewing the contest through that micro-party lens, several scenarios are possible. Perhaps One Nation emerges with a critical bloc, with Palmer hovering in the background. Perhaps there’s a Lambie bloc with a returned Xenophon hovering in the background. Given we are now only weeks away from the faux campaign transitioning to the real one, given the 2022 contest is already well under way on the ground right around the country, it pays to remember that the makeup of the next Senate matters. The House contest determines who governs. But the Senate always shapes what happens next.",News/Australia news,"From Lambie’s ‘loud girl’ to Ericmentum, Tasmania’s fierce Senate race is a taste of what’s to come | Katharine Murphy",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2022/mar/26/from-lambies-loud-girl-to-ericmentum-tasmanias-fierce-senate-race-is-a-taste-of-whats-to-come
3/26/2022,"The idea of building a massive dam in Queensland’s Burdekin rangelands has been revived and then scrapped, over and over again, for more than 80 years. The site known as Hells Gates was first surveyed for a dam by the engineer Jack Bradfield in 1938. Bradfield, who built the Sydney Harbour Bridge, thought he could irrigate the Queensland interior and change the arid climate of central Australia (an idea that has been largely debunked by scientists) by diverting northern floodwaters to the west of the Great Dividing Range. About two decades later, folks in the Whitsunday region, a few hundred kilometres south, started talking about the idea of damming Urannah Creek, on the slopes of the Eungella Range. Over the years, plans for the Urannah Dam have been formally studied and discarded at least 18 separate times. “There’s a reason people haven’t built these dams before,” says Maryanne Slattery, a water researcher and former member of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. “They don’t stack up. They’ve never stacked up.” But still the politicians come back, decade after decade, with promises of money and new feasibility studies. This week and last, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, announced a combined $5.9bn in federal funding to build the Hells Gates and Urannah dams. The dam proposals have not been scrutinised by the government’s own National Water Grid advisory board; the Hells Gates plan does not have an environmental impact study (no study is even in development); nor does it have a detailed business case, which is due for completion after the federal election. The dam funding is contingent on the business case stacking up, Morrison said in his announcement. So it seems fair to ask why announce the funding now? Decades of past failures on these projects have only served to embolden Morrison and Joyce’s pitch to be viewed as nation-building pioneers; sure of success where premiers and prime ministers have repeatedly failed for decades, and where questions about viability remain in dispute. “Governments seem to operate on this understanding or assumption that Queenslanders respond to big, shiny things,” says Chris Salisbury, a political historian from the University of Queensland. “That these projects so often are seen to be targeted at north Queensland isn’t an accident; that mentality or perception that regional parts of Queensland still needs to be pandered to. “It’s no accident these are happening in seats that both parties are targeting.” Salisbury says “pie-in-the-sky, pioneer thinking” should be treated with scepticism. “There’s still this undercurrent of nation-building, breaking the frontier, transforming it into something that it’s not, and not meant to be,” he says. “This long-cherished dream.” The Hells Gates and Urannah dam announcements are pitched at constituents in a string of bellwether Queensland electorates – the same seats that shifted decisively to Morrison’s government in 2019, as debate about the Adani Carmichael coalmine raged in the region. Labor’s review of its federal election loss in 2019 found that the party’s “ambiguous language on Adani, combined with some anti-coal rhetoric, devastated its support in the coalmining communities of regional Queensland”. In the months before the election, Adani had launched an advertising campaign criticising the Queensland Labor government for stalling on the mine’s approvals. On Wednesday, as he announced Hells Gates, Morrison name-checked Adani as his language seamlessly shifted from nation-builder to exponent of wedge politics. “The sooner we can get the state government to approve building this dam, then we can get under way. And so that is the next key step. So when they tell us it’s approved, we can get moving,” Morrison said. “It took a long time to get Adani under way and that was a strong case and that is transforming north Queensland. “Now, the only thing that will stop it, I think, is if the Greens get in the ear of either the federal Labor party, which we’ve seen them do that before. Or they get in the ear of the state Labor government. But as far as the LNP is concerned, here in Queensland, we’re all for building this dam and many more.” Labor’s response to Morrison’s attempt to turn dams into Adani 2.0 has been to dismiss the announcement as electioneering without substance. So the Morrison Joyce govt didn’t get advice from their own chosen experts, let alone a business case, before announcing this multi-billion dollar commitment.It’s just another Morrison photo-op.#auspol https://t.co/MLnd5v8NxH The Queensland water minister, Glenn Butcher, says: “To put $5.4 billion on the table for a project that doesn’t even have a detailed business case together yet is a little bit embarrassing for the government.” The proponents of the Hells Gates and Urannah dams sing the praises of the projects. Hells Gate will, says Townsville Enterprise, potentially irrigate 50,000ha of the rangelands, allowing for the expansion of agriculture. Bowen River Utilities says the Urannah Dam stacks up financially, and has overwhelming support from the Greater Whitsunday region. “Urannah Dam will transform the region with water security and reliable energy and is strongly supported by both major political parties and all three levels of government,” says James Benjamin, the chief executive of Bowen River Utilities. Documents submitted by the Urannah proponents to the federal government for environmental assessment show it has consulted major coalmine operators in the Bowen Basin about buying water from the scheme. Despite this rosy sales pitch, concerns remain that the projects are uneconomic and would be environmentally damaging. An analysis of the preliminary business case for the Urannah Dam, for instance, found the project could return as little as 26c for every dollar invested. Hydrologists have long expressed doubts about the viability of damming Australia’s northern rivers, which they say have “limited natural storage capacity”. A 2008 study said there was “relatively little opportunity in many northern rivers to actively harvest water for on-farm storage”. Willem Vervoort, the leading hydrologist at the University of Sydney, told Guardian Australia that northern Australian waterways were too variable to be effectively dammed. “Climate change is going to make this dam case even worse, it’s going to make the climate more variable,” he says. “You’ll have bigger floods and longer dry periods. “I don’t have any problem with society making a decision that irrigated agriculture is of importance and that it’s something to invest in, but as long as we realise there’s a trade off. If we do that, there will be an impact where we take the water from. “We can’t magic water. If we take it from some place it’s not going to be somewhere else. That trade off must be considered.” Environmental groups and experts have raised significant concerns about “disastrous environmental consequences” from Hells Gates, primarily the impact of expanded agriculture – and increased sediment and nutrient pollution – going into the Burdekin catchment, which runs out onto the Great Barrier Reef. The Burdekin mayor, Lyn McLaughlin, has called for catchment-wide planning to assess impacts on water flows. If the federal government’s dam funding blitz is designed to create an Adani-style wedge issue in north Queensland, the Coalition appears to be unexpectedly now dealing with the thin edge. The political story to take hold this week has not been the government’s attempts to pressure Labor into backing its dam plans; instead, reporting has focused on two blokes in Akubras, arguing about the details. Bob Katter has wanted to build the Hells Gates dam since he was first elected to the Queensland parliament, aged 29, in 1974. The federal member for Kennedy in north Queensland says he could have “basked in the glory” of a lifelong political ambition, after Wednesday’s government announcement. “But then I’d be a hypocritical liar,” Katter says. He says the government’s plan is a “betrayal” of Bradfield’s vision because the dam won’t be built high enough to send the water to the west; that the $5.4bn investment would instead amount to creating only 70 new farms. Maxine Newlands, a political scientist from James Cook University in Townsville, says Morrison’s announcement tapped into messages that Katter’s party uses effectively at state level, where it holds three seats in north Queensland. Things like the need to “cut green tape”, and that environmental regulation stops progress. “You can tell there’s an election in the air,” Newlands says. “Some of it [appears to be] to designed get Bob’s support and to get his legacy.” But on Thursday, Katter spoke at length to the Guardian about the original Bradfield vision. He read aloud from a letter, sent by former deputy prime minister Michael McCormack last year, that said the dam wall would be 395m high. Joyce has previously said the water should go west. “It was a day of heartbreak for me after nearly 50 years of work on this,” Katter says. “The people of Australia have waited nearly 100 years to get this scheme and they’ve destroyed it.”",News/Australia news,‘Pie in the sky’: Coalition’s $6bn dams pitch puts politics before process,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/25/pie-in-the-sky-coalitions-6bn-dams-pitch-puts-politics-before-process
3/26/2022,"Western officials have said they believe a Russian commander was run over and killed by mutinous forces during the fighting in Ukraine, in a sign of what they described as the “morale challenges” faced by the invading forces. They highlighted – and repeated – reports from earlier this week from a Ukrainian journalist that a colonel of the 37th separate guards motor rifle brigade was run over by a tank and subsequently died of his injuries. One official said they believed that the brigade commander was “killed by his own troops” as “a consequence of the scale of losses that had been taken by his brigade” in the bitter fighting. However, while there was some evidence to corroborate the claim that the commander had been run over, it was less clear whether, as the western officials claimed, the colonel had died. The original report of the mutiny was made on Wednesday on Facebook by a Ukrainian journalist, Roman Tsymbaliuk, who said that it occurred after the unit, which had been fighting in Makariv, west of Kyiv, had lost “about 50% of their personnel”. “After choosing a convenient moment, during the fight, he ran over the commander standing next to him, injuring both his legs,” the journalist wrote. The colonel was then moved to a hospital in Belarus. A separate film released by the Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, a close ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, showed the commander, Yuri Medvedev, being transported by medical troops, in which he is clearly alive. In it, a Chechen fighter speaks to a soldier on a stretcher who clearly has leg injuries, saying: “Hold on … How are you? OK? Talk to us …” The stricken soldier replies: “I’m OK. Where are you from?” Corroborating evidence for the claim made by western officials that the colonel had died was limited to the headline of a report on the MailOnline website, which said: “Russian commander who was deliberately run over with a tank driven by his own disgruntled soldiers in protest at the huge death toll in his unit has DIED.” Britain and other western countries believe that Russian forces are suffering from increasingly poor morale as they incur heavy losses in the fighting. The US has estimated that 7,000 Russians have been killed, out of an invasion force of about 150,000. Western officials believe that about one-sixth or maybe one-fifth of Russia’s original invasion force, which comprised an estimated 20 battalion tactical groups, is “no longer combat-effective” – a high degree of losses, reflecting the botched invasion and fierce Ukrainian fightback. Seven Russian generals have been killed in the fighting, which has also led to several thousand Ukrainian military fatalities and civilian casualties. The latest official UN figure for civilian deaths is 1,081 but that is almost certainly an underestimate.",News/World news,"Mutinous Russian troops ran over their own commander, say western officials",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/russian-troops-mutiny-commander-ukraine-report-western-officials
3/26/2022,"The British Museum has become the latest cultural organisation to remove the Sackler family name from galleries and rooms they have supported. George Osborne, the museum’s chair, announced the move on Twitter, saying: “We’re moving into a new era, presenting our great collection in different ways for new audiences.” For decades the Sackler name had been associated with generous philanthropic donations to galleries and museums in the UK, Europe and the US. However, in recent years it has become toxic, with the family accused of making a profit from the US opioids crisis. The Mortimer and Raymond branches of the Sackler family owned Purdue Pharma, the maker of the opioid painkiller OxyContin, which played a central role in what has been described as “the worst drug crisis in American history”. Osborne said the museum had reached an agreement with the Raymond & Beverly Sackler Foundation to remove the Sackler name from all the galleries, rooms and endowments they had supported. That includes the Raymond & Beverly Sackler Galleries of the Ancient Levant, which opened in 1998 and contain treasures from a region which corresponds with modern-day Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan and western Syria. It also had “Sackler rooms” available for commercial hire. The campaign to disavow Sackler money has been spearheaded by the American art photographer and activist Nan Goldin, founder of the campaign group Pain (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now). It has had a number of notable successes. Tate announced in 2019 that it would no longer take donations from the Sackler family. Last month it was reported that a plaque marking “the Sackler escalator” had been removed and a sign by the “Sackler lifts” had been taken down. The Serpentine Sackler Gallery in Kensington Gardens, London, which opened in 2013, was rebranded as the Serpentine North Gallery last year. The Metropolitan Museum in New York and the Louvre in Paris are among a number of galleries that have moved to distance themselves from the Sackler name. In a statement the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Foundation said it had long admired the work of the British Museum. It read: “As the museum develops a new masterplan to transform for the future, we feel this decision comes at a unique moment in the museum’s evolution.” Osborne said: “The British Museum is grateful for the foundation’s past support, and the trustees appreciate their cooperation in coming to this agreement as we now move the museum into a new era and present our incredible collections in different ways for new audiences.” The museum said it had received Sackler money from the late 1990s to 2013. There were no plans, it added, to remove other names or review relations with other donors.",Arts/Culture,British Museum removes Sackler family name from galleries,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/25/british-museum-removes-sackler-family-name-from-galleries
3/26/2022,"Aheatwave in the Arctic and the collapse of the Conger ice shelf in East Antarctica bring warnings that climate breakdown could be accelerating. There are signs of melting at weather stations near the north pole, with temperatures 30C above normal. In Antarctica, temperatures are 40C up. While the Conger ice shelf is too small to cause significant sea-level rises, its collapse points to growing instability. These weather events do more than offer proof of the dangers of global heating. They also risk triggering changes that could accelerate the disruption. When policymakers and the public are focused on war in Ukraine and the rising cost of living, it is hard to be reminded of the existential threat posed by rising temperatures. But the extent to which climate has faded from consciousness in the months since the UN conference in Glasgow is frightening. If we are to avoid the worst effects of global heating, with around half the world’s population said by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to be highly vulnerable, it is imperative to make drastic changes to our global energy system. Of course, extreme weather at the poles doesn’t affect people in the same way as in densely populated areas. But the truth is that even when large populations are harmed, dangerous weather events in poorer countries do not reliably catch and keep international attention. Generally it takes a crisis in a rich, developed nation for western audiences to take notice of what runaway warming could mean: the record-smashing heat dome in the northern US and Canada last summer, for example, or fires and heatwaves in California and Europe. Even then, we are learning all the time how quickly memories fade, and how hard it is to keep climate at the top of the agenda. The world’s political and economic systems were not built to conserve the Earth’s atmosphere. Whether our human focus on short-term goals is learned or hardwired, and whether we regard governments, corporations or civilisation itself as responsible for the failure to dismantle our fossil-fuel-powered global system, one fact is known. As long as emissions keep rising, we are failing to prioritise our collective long-term survival. It’s not only at the poles that we see climate disaster unfolding. In the Horn of Africa, conditions are the driest since 1981 and scientists believe the failure of three consecutive rainy seasons has been exacerbated by global heating. Somalia faces the risk of famine, with a million malnourished children. In November, Madagascar’s environment minister used the global stage of Cop26 to link high-carbon western lifestyles with the desperate hardship endured by people in her country due to climate-induced droughts – and the failure of western governments to deliver the climate finance that would pay for a pipeline. Animals, as well as people, are doing their best to adapt to changing conditions. This week, US scientists revealed research showing that many species of birds are building nests and laying eggs around a month earlier than a century ago. Such adjustments are a vital part of the climate message. Without the hope they offer, that we can find ways to live in changed conditions, the danger is that the prospect becomes too scary, prompting reactions of either avoidance or despair. This was the message of the recent film Don’t Look Up, with it satirical portrait of a world hellbent on denial as scientists try to warn about an approaching comet. It’s essential to stress that the climate crisis is not a comet that will instantly wipe out civilisation. In April, the IPCC will update its recommendations to governments on how to limit emissions. The shift to green power remains achievable. But time is running out.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on record-breaking Arctic temperatures: do look up | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/25/the-guardian-view-on-record-breaking-arctic-temperatures-do-look-up
