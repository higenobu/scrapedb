2/17/2022,"Wildlife Works-Mount Pleasant An animal rehabilitation center in western Pennsylvania has released the findings of a DNA test for a rescued critter brought in to the center last month. ""The results are in!"" the agency wrote on its Facebook page on Monday. ""Our 'mystery animal' DNA sample came back, 100% coyote!"" The Youngwood-based organization began treating the then-unidentified creature on Jan. 17, after a woman in Fairfield Township found paw prints outside her home that led her to an emaciated, freezing animal. At first, the woman kept the animal in her basement until TJ's Rescue Hideaway, a local foster-based rescue, could transport it to Wildlife Works.

No one at Wildlife Works, a wildlife rehab, could identify the animal species with certainty because of the creature's poor health and physical appearance. The staff then took samples from the animal for DNA testing to determine what species is under their care, the results of which were revealed this week.

""What do you think I am, dog or coyote?"" Wildlife Works wrote with a photo of the animal on Facebook in January. ""This pup was admitted to us last night. Suspect it has mange and we will be treating it accordingly. We also will be doing testing to confirm what it is!"" Morgan Barron of Wildlife Works told WPXI at the time that the animal was ""very timid, very scared and not aggressive"" and that this behavior led her to believe the creature was a dog. ""I honestly can't definitively say what it is, but to err on the side of caution, since they can carry rabies and since it might be a coyote ... [we will] get genetic testing done and go from there,"" Barron added. RELATED: Emaciated Dog Left Caged Outside in Freezing Weather Called a 'Christmas Miracle' After Recovery In another update since finding the animal, the rehab center shared the animal's progress while awaiting test results. ""We are overwhelmed and thankful for all the love and support this guy is getting! Thank you to everyone that has donated and shared his story,"" the facility wrote on Jan. 24. ""We did not expect his story to get as big as it did, but we are thankful for the awareness it has given to wildlife rehabilitation. With that being said, we are still waiting for the results of the DNA sample to come in,"" Wildlife Works added. ""He is doing much better now and is much more alert than when he came to us last week. He is still not showing extreme signs of aggression but is more on the defensive side."" However, before the center got the DNA results back to identify the coyote, it escaped.

2/17/2022,"On Tuesday, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani called the January 6 committee ""illegal."" Giuliani said the committee ""can't subpoena anybody,"" despite having been issued a subpoena in January. The New York Times earlier reported that Giuliani intended to be ""less confrontational"" towards the committee. Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani condemned the January 6 committee as ""illegal"" and said it doesn't have the power to issue subpoenas — despite having been subpoenaed by the panel last month. ""How can you have any confidence in this committee, which by the way is illegal,"" Giuliani said on Tuesday evening while appearing on Newsmax. ""I mean, it doesn't have a minority membership. It really can't subpoena anybody."" The House's rules for subpoenas require consultation between a committee's majority and minority members, and Giuliani's claim about lacking minority membership appears to discount GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger's and Rep. Liz Cheney's participation in the January 6 panel. —Acyn (@Acyn) February 16, 2022 Giuliani's remarks come days after The New York Times reported he had signaled, through his lawyer, his intention to be ""less confrontational"" towards the House committee's requests for information. In January, Giuliani was issued a subpoena which claimed the former mayor had ""actively promoted claims of election fraud"" for Trump and ""sought to convince state legislators to take steps to overturn the election results."" Kinzinger said on Sunday that he expected Giuliani, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, to cooperate with the subpoena. ""That's the law. That's the requirement. Same if somebody is subpoenaed to court. There may be some changes in dates and moments here as lawyers do their back and forth, but we fully expect that in accordance with the law, we'll hear from Rudy,"" the Illinois rep. said on CBS' ""Face The Nation."" Robert Costello, Giuliani's lawyer, did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

2/17/2022,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A long-haul Emirates flight heading to Washington in December failed to properly climb and flew incredibly low and fast over the city-state before later gaining altitude over the sea, investigators acknowledged Thursday. No one was injured in the Dec. 19 flight, but such low altitudes and high speeds can cause damage to an aircraft and increases the risk of striking a tall building. Tracking data suggests Flight No. EK231 was just 200 feet off the ground at points as it flew over Dubai's Deira neighborhood before reaching the Persian Gulf. The initial report by the General Civil Aviation Authority said the female pilot flying the Boeing 777 for the nighttime departure had put the plane's altitude selector to 4,000 feet, which is standard. The pilot also said she followed the instructions of the plane's onboard computer, the report said. However, the plane flew low and fast. Investigators say they recovered data from the plane, but the cockpit voice recorder had been “overwritten,” without elaborating. Investigators say their final report will focus on “the root cause of the shallow climb of the aircraft and the crew performance.” Emirates, a state-owned airline in Dubai, declined to comment Thursday. The Air Current, a website focused on the aviation industry, first reported on the incident.",U.S./Associated Press,Investigators say Emirates flight to Washington flew too low,https://news.yahoo.com/investigators-emirates-flight-washington-flew-055953619.html
