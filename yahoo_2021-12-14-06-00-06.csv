12/14/2021,"J.K. Rowling is being slammed by transgender activists — again — after criticizing the Scottish police for saying they'd allow rape suspects to self-identify as female should Scotland's proposed pro-trans policies take effect next year.  The Harry Potter author, who’s past transphobic comments have created a major rift among her fans, took to Twitter on Sunday by sharing an article from The Times of London that examined the issue. “War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength,” Rowling wrote, referencing George Orwell’s dystopian novel, 1984, before adding, “The Penised Individual Who Raped You Is a Woman.” The debate comes in the midst of plans to reform the Gender Recognition Act, which would make it easier for trans people in Scotland to be legally recognized by their true gender identity. In part, the new policies would remove medical checks for those seeking a gender recognition certificate and shorten the time frame people must live as their gender identity before it’s legally recognized. While plans to add these new policies to the Gender Recognition Act were shelved by the Scottish government last term over concerns about women’s rights, the government aims to complete the process by mid-2022, according to several reports.  Gary Ritchie, assistant chief constable, confirmed with the Scottish Sun that should the new laws take effect, even rape suspects would indeed be “recorded as a woman” if they were biologically born male but self-identify as women, even if they don’t “have a full gender recognition certificate.” Detective Superintendent Fil Capaldi also confirmed this was the case, citing that doing so would not just be in line with the law, but also with their own values.  “The sex/gender identification of individuals who come into contact with the police will be based on how they present or how they self-declare, which is consistent with the values of the organization,” he told the paper. “Police Scotland requires no evidence or certification as proof of biological sex or gender identity other than a person’s self-declaration, unless it is pertinent to any investigation with which they are linked.” It should be noted that the rapes highlighted in these debates are theoretical and only represent arguments in line with Scotland’s proposed transgender laws, as mentioned above. Meanwhile, Harry Potter fans and trans activists alike are speaking out about Rowling’s fixation on trans issues, criticizing the author for linking trans identity with rape and for not using her platform to highlight the number of sexual assaults committed by cisgender men. ""As a survivor of sexual assault, I’m outraged that J.K. Rowling has once again used her enormous platform to cause harm and to conflate transgender identity with rape,” trans journalist and activist Dawn Ennis tells Yahoo Life. “As a writer, I’m gobsmacked that Rowling would categorize rape as something that only involves a penis, and that she’d steal so blatantly from Orwell without so much as a tip of the hat.” YouTuber and trans activist Kate Blaque chimed in, writing on Twitter: ""As a survivor and a trans woman, it will always upset me how seemingly desperate people are to establish transgender women as inherently sexually predatory in a world that views us as un-rapeable.""  I'm barely engaging with JK Rowling discourse these days, but as a survivor and a trans woman, it will always upset me how seemingly desperate people are to establish transgender women as inherently sexually predatory in a world that views us as un-rapeable. — I'm a Pirate (yeah yeah) (@kat_blaque) December 13, 2021 ""Anyone is capable of rape, trans women included, but I have a very hard time seeing the over emphasis on trans women as justified,"" she continued. ""Especially when contrasted with just how many trans women are raped because they are trans.""  Blaque, who's been vocal about Rowling's transphobic remarks in the past, tells Yahoo Life that while she tries to ""mostly ignore"" Rowling's anti-trans posts, she acknowledges the author is ""very much making publicly maligning trans women and defining them as rapists very normalized.""   Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, executive director for the National Center for Transgender Equality, tells Yahoo Life that Rowling's tweet adds to the ""dangerous"" narrative that trans women are predators, which can be terribly traumatic for trans youth. “She has an incredible platform, and she is using it to hurt transgender people,"" Heng-Lehtinen says. ""Imagine what it must mean to a young transgender person falling in love with her novels only to learn that the author uses her tremendous power to attack your humanity. We are seeing a record-breaking number of murders of transgender people, especially Black transgender women, and political leaders around the world are trying to keep trans youth from playing sports or receiving appropriate health care. Rowling’s tweet adds to the dangerous, false narrative that transgender women are predators. The stakes are incredibly high for trans lives, and Rowling’s continuing attacks make it worse."" ""The biggest threats of violence against women has [sic] always been cisgender men,"" Queer Eye's Jonathan Van Ness wrote on Twitter. ""Not trans women, unless JK’s constant transphobic cherry picked vitriol convinces you otherwise. But as trans women are assaulted, deprived of work, killed, and raped, JK is safe in her mansion.""  The biggest threats of violence against women has always been cis gender men. Not trans women, unless Jk’s constant transphobic cherry picked vitriol convinces you otherwise. But as trans women are assaulted, deprived of work, killed, and raped JK is safe in her mansion. https://t.co/4OJXX96gOC — Jonathan Van Ness (@jvn) December 13, 2021 On the flip side, some leaders in Scotland say the proposed policy changes would do more to harm women than protect the transgender community.  “As a lawyer for 20 years and justice secretary for almost eight, I’ve seen some legal absurdities. But this tops it all and is dangerous,"" Kenny MacAskill, the former Scottish justice secretary and current member of the Scottish nationalist Alba Party, told the Scottish Sun. ""It's physically impossible and is about dogma overriding common sense. Women prisoners are being harmed by this and vital crime statistics rendered useless.” And Lisa Mackenzie, a member of the Edinburgh-based policy research group MurrayBlackburnMackenzie, which lobbies for ""sex as a protected characteristic,"" wants Scottish police to log the theoretical rapist's gender by their sex at birth, she tells the Sun, arguing that ""it’ll only take a few mis-c­lassified cases to skew statistics.” Other Rowling supporters have given their two cents on Twitter, with one commenter writing, ""Thank you for calling out the insanity,"" with another adding, ""Thank you. You have no idea how important your voice is, or how much it means to women and girls.""  Thank you. You have no idea how important your voice is, or how much it means to women and girls 💕 — Susan Dalgety (@DalgetySusan) December 12, 2021 Still, trans activists are standing their ground, many of them criticizing Rowling and others like her for routinely spewing misinformation about the trans experience — and praising the Scottish police for their stance on the issue.  ""As a woman of transgender experience, I am going to ignore this increasingly irrelevant attention-whore and enjoy my self-identified life as the woman I am: safe in the knowledge that at least the police in Scotland respect human rights, even for the most ghastly of criminals,"" Ennis tells Yahoo Life. ""What Rowling does in her comfortable castle is her choice. But how sad, that this is how an author who has given the world such imaginative tales wastes her remaining days.""  Other commenters have shared their own reactions:  This is so awful and hurtful. You have such power, yet you choose to wield it to attack people like my daughter, who is one of the loveliest people I know on this planet. Shame on you, and I hope someday you realize the pain you’re causing and deeply feel regret for your words. — R.B. Shifman (@rshifman) December 13, 2021 I know it shouldn’t by now, but it never ceases to disappoint me to see what you’ve become. You’ll argue you’re just speaking common sense or defending women, but what you’re actually doing is using those ideas as excuses to hate on and attack a marginalized community. It’s sad. — Mx. Amanda Jetté Knox (@MavenOfMayhem) December 13, 2021 as a trans person who used to love the harry potter series, this is so disheartening, and i should expect it from you by now, but for some reason i always hope that there’s enough evidence that most trans people arent a threat for you to change, but it never happens — alexander 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️ he/they (@lemonademoss) December 13, 2021 As a former fan of yours, someone who has been long inspired to pursue writing as a result of your work, I cannot put into words how disappointing it is that you've chosen to make hatred your main goal in life now. Congrats, Ms. Rowling - you've become Umbridge. — Gyt Kaliba (@GytKaliba) December 13, 2021 Sunday's tweet is the latest in a series of battles between Rowling and the trans community.  Last month, the tension reached a new level when activists shared the author's home address on Twitter, prompting Rowling to address them by noting that ""best way to prove your movement isn’t a threat to women, is to stop stalking, harassing and threatening us."" It all began, though, in December 2019, when the author gave her public support to Maya Forstater — a U.K. woman who was fired for noting, among other beliefs, that it is ""impossible to change sex"" — after a judge ruled that her views were not protected under Britain’s anti-discrimination laws. (She later won an appeal and posted a video thanking Rowling for her support.) Then, in May 2020, Rowling accidentally tweeted a message with an expletive that misgendered a trans woman named Tara Wolf, who was convicted in 2017 of assaulting a woman she referred to as a TERF (“trans-exclusionary radical feminist”), a term used to describe anti-trans feminists or women who exclude trans women in conversations about women’s rights. Rowling apologized for the tweet and later deleted it. If sex isn’t real, there’s no same-sex attraction. If sex isn’t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives. It isn’t hate to speak the truth. — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) June 6, 2020 The author went viral again in June 2020 when she criticized an article using the inclusive phrase “people who menstruate,” which recognized that not every person who experiences a period identifies as female.  “I’m sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?” she wrote at the time, responding with a series of tweets — as well as a lengthy personal essay defending her position.  'Harry Potter' author JK Rowling has claimed three people shared her address online, but insists she was not ""intimidated"" because she has received so many death threats she could ""paper the house with them"".",World/Yahoo Life,J.K.

12/14/2021,"Consider the two faces of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). First, the Rand Paul of Dec. 11, writing to President Biden after a string of tornadoes devastated his home state, killing at least 64 and leveling whole communities: ""The Governor of the Commonwealth has requested federal assistance this morning, and certainly further requests will be coming as the situation is assessed. I fully support those requests and ask that you move expeditiously to approve the appropriate resources for our state."" People here will say they have great compassion and they want to help the people of Puerto Rico, the people of Texas, the people of Florida, but notice they have great compassion with someone else's money. Sen. Rand Paul, 2017 Second, the Rand Paul of Oct. 24, 2017, on the Senate floor opposing a $36.5-billion disaster aid bill to help residents of Texas, Louisiana, Florida and Puerto Rico after hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria as well as victims of wildfires in California: ""People here will say they have great compassion and they want to help the people of Puerto Rico, the people of Texas, the people of Florida, but notice they have great compassion with someone else's money. Ask them what they're doing to help their fellow man."" One almost feels guilty pointing out the hypocrisy of people like Paul, because it's just so easy. A cursory glance at his record indicates that he has consistently opposed federal disaster relief measures. The received wisdom is that he has voted against every one for the last 10 years; it's hard to confirm that precisely, but examples of his speaking against most of them are easy to find. The Governor of the Commonwealth has requested federal assistance this morning... I fully support those requests and ask that you move expeditiously to approve the appropriate resources for our state. Sen. Rand Paul, 2021 (to President Biden) Paul also has opposed coronavirus relief measures, such as the first pandemic response act, passed in March 2020 with a 96-1 senate vote, Rand standing against it alone. He also opposed a 2020 bill to aid first responders still suffering from the effects of 9/11. On disaster aid, Paul voted against a 2013 bill to aid victims of Hurricane Sandy, and earlier this year blocked accelerated passage of the Gulf Coast Hurricane Aid Act, a measure to aid victims of the storms in Louisiana. It's still pending. In all those cases, Paul has couched his opposition as protests against the funding for those bills, specifically the borrowing to pay for them. He's argued that they should all be funded by taking money from other causes, specifically from foreign aid, about which he's strongly critical. One would like to admire Paul for consistency, at least, except that he's been selective about his anti-spending positions. He voted in favor of the 2017 tax cuts, one of the largest budget-busting measures in recent history (and one that chiefly benefits rich people), for instance. The tax cuts passed the Senate without a single Republican in opposition or a single Democrat in favor. That points to a fundamental difference between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to disaster aid. Republicans are cheeseparing about public aid until and unless it's for their constituents specifically; Democrats tend to see the issue broadly, favoring these programs regardless of geography. Republican posturing against disaster aid ""for thee, but not for me"" is a hardy perennial on Capitol Hill. In 2019, noted the Center for American Progress, 43 of the 58 GOP House members who voted against a $19-billion disaster relief bill had earlier ""demanded or endorsed emergency aid funding for their own states."" The measure, which had already been approved by the Senate, passed the House 354-58, with all the ""no"" votes coming from Republicans. In 2013, a $50.5-billion relief package for Hurricane Sandy, which had devastated the Northeast, was opposed by 36 Republican senators. Of those votes, 31 came from Republicans who had previously sought disaster aid for their own states. Among the opponents were Paul and Senators Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who had both sought relief aid for their own states from Hurricane Sandy. On occasion, savvy politicians can use disasters elsewhere to secure money for their own purposes. The best example of this dates from the 1920s, when the Imperial Valley's congressman, Phil Swing, needed to quell opposition to the Boulder Canyon Act, which would fund the project that became Hoover Dam. A 1927 flood on the Mississippi killed 246 people, sweeping away bridges and breaching the levees over a thousand-mile stretch of the river. A member of the House Flood Control Committee, Swing convened hearings on a levee construction program costing an unprecedented $300 million and invited New Orleans business and political leaders to attend. “I took on the New Orleans men one after another,"" Swing would recount, ""putting to them again and again whether they could see any difference between the Mississippi’s flood threat to their people and the Colorado River flood threat to the people of the Imperial Valley…. The Editor of the New Orleans Picayune came up to give me warm assurances that they would all work for my bill."" The bill passed, and the dam project was launched four years later. Raising spending issues to denigrate projects you think are irrelevant to your own constituents has been known to devolve into farce. Remember the GOP response to President Obama's first State of the Union message in 2009? Then-Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, the designated responder being puffed up at the time as a potential presidential candidate, mined Obama's recession recovery bill for provisions he could ridicule. The measure included ""$140 million for something called volcano monitoring,” Jindal mocked. “Instead of monitoring volcanoes, what Congress should be monitoring is the eruption of spending in Washington, D.C."" Less than one month later, Alaska's Mt. Redoubt erupted, threatening Anchorage with an ash storm and forcing the delay or cancellation of commercial flights that passed over the area. Leaving aside that active volcanoes around the U.S. potentially threaten thousands of Americans with mudslides, poisonous gas emissions and lava flows, the $140 million Jindal cited covered not only volcano monitoring, but economic recovery funds for his own state. Republicans aren't alone in exploiting budget fears to hobble government assistance. Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), has set a new standard for the practice by opposing relief measures that would help his own state more than most others. ""Few states are as reliant as West Virginia on federal money, or get back more than residents pay in taxes,"" my colleague Jackie Calmes observed in reviewing Manchin's opposition to elements of President Biden's Build Back Better plan. ""Manchin’s constituents relied on federal aid for 33.3% of all personal income last year,"" compared with 20% in California. Among the provisions of the spending bill Manchin says he opposes are paid family and medical leave, home healthcare services and an extension of the child tax credit, all of which would flow to struggling West Virginians. Congressional critics of government spending aren't above taking credit for it when it serves their constituents. That's been the case with coronavirus aid and the $1.2-trillion infrastructure spending bill passed by Congress in November despite the opposition of 200 GOP members of the House and 30 of the 50 Republican senators (including Paul). Among those who have bragged about money reaching their districts or states from these bills after having voted against them are House members Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina and Gary Palmer of Alabama and Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi. The lesson that conservatives are constantly confronted with but never learn is that we're all in this world together. Disasters, whether climatological, meteorological or biological, know nothing of geographic boundaries, much less political or ideological ones. Conservatives oppose government spending on infrastructure and social programs only rhetorically because they do know a few things. They know the spending will help their constituents. They also know that the best way to establish their conservative cred is to oppose it, especially when they know it will pass anyway. Most of all, they know that more responsible political leaders will ensure that assistance gets to those in need, regardless of how their political representatives vote. Those elected representatives are happy to see the money, they just won't lift a finger to bring it home. There's a word for this sort of behavior: It's ""freeloading.""

The couple was spotted on Sunday going for a stroll in New York City, where they relocated last month following their low-key wedding ceremony. Because the law in Japan requires a princess to ""leave the imperial family upon marriage to a commoner,"" Princess Mako gave up her royal titles to marry Komuro. She also turned down a $1.3 million payout from the Japanese government that is traditionally paid to royal women who lose their royal status when they marry. Mako and Komuro coordinated in green and grey ensembles for the outing, with both wearing face masks.

Kennedy International Airport in New York City on November 15, just weeks after their wedding. They are renting an apartment in N.Y.C., according to the BBC, where Komuro works at a law firm after graduating from Fordham University's law school. According to reports earlier this month, Komuro failed the bar exam but plans to retake the test. The couple met while attending a study-abroad event at a restaurant in Shibuya, a district in Tokyo. They were both students at the International Christian University in Tokyo at the time. ""First I was attracted by his bright smile,"" Mako previously said, according to The Telegraph. Komuro proposed over dinner in December 2013, and their long-distance relationship quietly continued while Mako studied for her master's degree overseas, graduating in Art Museum and Gallery Studies in January 2016 from England's Leicester University. The couple first announced their plans to wed in September 2017, but the event was ultimately pushed off following a dispute over money between Komuro's mother and her former fiancé concerning his having financed Komuro's education. PHILIP FONG/AFP via Getty Images  Former Princess Mako and Kei Komuro They tied the knot on October 26 without the fanfare that usually accompanies a royal wedding. The Imperial Household Agency (IHA) explained that Mako and her now-husband did not want to have a big wedding ""because their marriage is not celebrated by many people."" At a press event in the afternoon, the couple appeared in front of journalists. Princess Mako wore a pastel blue dress with a matching jacket and a pearl necklace, while Komuro wore a striped suit.
