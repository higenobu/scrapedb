3/5/2022,"Former National Security Advisor John Bolton said Putin was ""waiting"" for Trump to withdraw the US from NATO. He previously warned that Trump would have withdrawn from the alliance if he'd won a 2nd term. Bolton also said Trump's ""main interest"" in Ukraine was trying to ""find Hillary Clinton's computer server."" Former National Security Advisor John Bolton said on Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin was waiting for former President Donald Trump to withdraw the United States from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization if he had won a second term. Bolton made the remarks during a virtual event with the Washington Post on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where Bolton mostly offered critiques of current President Joe Biden's foreign policy in the region. At the end of the event, he was asked by the Post's Michael Duffy about how close Trump came to withdrawing the country from NATO, a translantic security alliance that includes the United States, Canada, and most of Europe. ""I thought he put his foot over it, but at least he didn't withdraw then,"" said Bolton, who wrote in his memoir about Trump's consideration of withdrawing from NATO in 2018. ""In a second Trump term, I think he may well have withdrawn from NATO. And I think Putin was waiting for that."" Trump viewed NATO as a liability during his presidency, believing that European countries were not paying enough of their fair share of the burden of providing defense to the alliance. Bolton, a State Department official during the George W. Bush administration, was brought on to be Trump's national security advisor in 2018 only to be ousted a year and a half later. Bolton's latest comments come just days after he told Newsmax that Trump ""barely knew where Ukraine was,"" pushing back on a host who said the former president had been ""tough on Russia."" Asked whether he was satisfied by how the Trump administration handled Ukraine, Bolton criticized his former boss. ""I think it went very badly,"" said Bolton. ""It was hard to have discussions on geostrategic issues when the president's main interest was getting... Rudy Giuliani in to see [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky so they could go find Hillary Clinton's computer server. He added that Ukraine's position in the ""maelstrom of American presidential politics"" in the last few years made it difficult for Zelensky to establish a proper relationship with the United States, which Bolton said was Ukraine's ""potentially most important supporter."" Trump was impeached for the first time over his withholding of $400 million in military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure Zelensky to launch an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter over allegations of corruption. Bolton said on Friday that former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Defense Secretary Mark Esper were concerned by Trump's behavior at the time. ""All of us felt that we needed to bolster Ukraine security, and were appalled at what Trump was doing,"" he said.

3/5/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Vice President Mike Pence will urge Republicans to move on from the 2020 election, declaring “there is no room in this party for apologists for Putin” as he further cements his break from former President Donald Trump. Pence, in a speech Friday evening to the party's top donors in New Orleans, will take on those in his party who have failed to forcefully condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin for his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. “Where would Russian tanks be today if NATO had not expanded the borders of freedom? There is no room in this party for apologists for Putin,” Pence will say, according to excerpts from the speech. “There is only room for champions of freedom.” Pence does not directly reference the former president in excerpts shared ahead of his remarks. But Trump has repeatedly used language that has been criticized as deferential to Putin, including calling the Russian leader “smart” while insisting the attack never would have happened on his watch. Pence will also continue to push back on Trump's lies about the 2020 election as he lays the groundwork for a possible 2024 presidential run. Trump, who has been teasing his own comeback bid that could potentially put the two in direct competition, has continued to falsely insist that Pence had the power to overturn the 2020 election, which he did not. “Elections are about the future,"" Pence will say. ""My fellow Republicans, we can only win if we are united around an optimistic vision for the future based on our highest values. We cannot win by fighting yesterday’s battles, or by relitigating the past.” Pence has been increasingly willing to challenge Trump — a dramatic departure from his deferential posture as vice president. Pence has said the two men will likely never see “eye to eye” on the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the building in an effort to stop certification of Joe Biden's election victory And last month, he directly rebutted Trump’s false claims that he, as vice president, could have overturned the results, telling a gathering of lawyers in Florida that Trump was “wrong.” Still, he will join the oft-stated view of Trump and others in the Republican Party Friday evening in blaming President Biden for Putin's actions, accusing the current president of having “squandered the deterrence that our administration put in place to keep Putin and Russia from even trying to redraw international boundaries by force.” “It’s no coincidence that Russia waited until 2022 to invade Ukraine,” Pence will say, according to excerpts. “Weakness arouses evil, and the magnitude of evil sweeping across Ukraine speaks volumes about this president.” While Pence allies believe that he can forge a coalition that brings together movement conservatives, white Evangelical Christians and more establishment-minded Republicans, Trump’s attacks on Pence have made him deeply unpopular with large swaths of Trump’s loyal base, potentially complicating his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. Pence on Jan. 6 had to be whisked to safety with his family as a mob of Trump supporters breached the Capitol building, some chanting “Hang Mike Pence!”",Politics/Associated Press,Pence hits Trump: No room in GOP 'for apologists for Putin',https://news.yahoo.com/pence-hits-trump-no-room-211045739.html
3/5/2022,"The parents of Katie Meyer, the 22-year-old Stanford University soccer star found lifeless in her dorm room Tuesday, said their daughter’s sudden death came amid potential disciplinary measures from the school. “She died by suicide,” Gina Meyer confirmed to NBC’s “Today” show in an interview that aired Friday, adding that there were no “red flags” indicating anything was wrong with her daughter, who was months from graduation. She compared the days since her daughter’s death to a “nightmare” that doesn’t end. “It’s just horrific,” Gina Meyer said. The victim’s parents added that after their daughter’s death, they learned that Katie had received an email from Stanford officials warning of potential disciplinary measures against her in relation to a situation in which she acted in defense of one of her teammates. Her father Steven Meyer said that sticking up for a teammate is consistent with “Katie being Katie.” Gina said she and her husband can’t imagine what else could have contributed to their daughter’s death. “She had been getting letters for a couple months,” she said. “This letter was kind of the final letter that there was going to be a trial or some kind of something.” Gina and Steven Meyer said they have not seen the email that may have had their daughter concerned. The victim’s mom said the drive to be a good student and competitive athlete comes with anxiety. Stanford University told “Today” in a statement that the school could not comment on disciplinary matters involving students, but that the entire community was devastated by the California native’s death. “We as a university community continue to grieve with Katie’s family and cherish our memories of her,” the university said.",U.S./NY Daily News,Katie Meyer’s parents suspect Stanford soccer star’s ‘horrific’ death by suicide came amid disciplinary fears,https://news.yahoo.com/katie-meyer-parents-suspect-stanford-182000635.html
3/5/2022,"Russia aired video of the wrecked AN-225, the world's largest plane and a symbol of Ukrainian pride. The plane was destroyed in a pitched battle for Hostomel airport, a key target near Kyiv. Russia state TV sought to blame Ukraine for its destruction, despite evidence to the contrary. Video broadcast by Russian state TV showed the mangled wreckage of the world's largest cargo plane, the Antonov AN-225, which was destroyed near Kyiv in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Footage of the ruined Ukrainian jet was shown Friday on Russia's state-run Channel 1 and from there shared on Western social-media channels. It was not clear whether it was live or pre-recorded. The plane, also named Mriya, meaning ""Dream,"" is a point of Ukrainian pride. Channel 1's correspondent, Irina Kuksenkova, reported from Hostomel airport, a fiercely contested airstrip around 15 miles from the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. The airfield was targeted on the first day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and was captured but quickly retaken by Ukrainian forces, as described in detail by The Wall Street Journal. The plane was badly damaged that day, The Journal reported. According to Ukraine's state-owned defense conglomerate Ukroboronprom, it was at the airport for repairs. Since then it has not been clear who has controlled the airport and when. According to the Channel 1 broadcast, Russian troops were in control at the time of the recording. Ukroboronprom said on February 27 that the plane had been destroyed, blaming Russia. ""Russia has hit the Mriya as a symbol of Ukraine's aviation capabilities,"" its statement read, calling the AN-225 plane the ""flagship of Ukrainian aviation."" However in the Russian broadcast on Friday, Kuksenkova said it was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery strikes. Neither Kuksenkova nor Ukroboronprom cited sources or gave evidence for their competing claims. The Channel 1 images are consistent with an unsourced video, said to be from February 25 or 26, that circulated online in recent days. —IgorGirkin (@GirkinGirkin) March 3, 2022 The plane was built and operated by Ukroboronprom subsidiary Antonov. The company has yet to respond to the Channel 1 footage of its plane, but did react to the earlier video, writing ""NO NO NO NO"" in a tweet. Antonov said it had no direct knowledge of the plane's condition, and urged people to wait for its announcements on whether it can be restored. —ANTONOV Company 🇺🇦 (@AntonovCompany) March 3, 2022 Ukroboronprom, in its announcement, estimated the cost of restoration at $3 billion, and said Russia should pay for it.
