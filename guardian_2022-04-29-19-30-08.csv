4/29/2022,"A collective sigh of relief on Monday as news is confirmed that Emmanuel Macron has been re-elected as president of France, seeing off a threat of from the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, and, shortly afterwards, tomato-throwing crowds in a suburb of Paris. Macron, who captured 58.6% of the vote, took his first walkabout post-election and was met with a barrage of squishy missiles, causing his security detail to unleash an Inspector Gadget-style device, after squealing the heads-up: “Projectile!” (It might not have been a squeal.) The whole thing could’ve been a scene from James Bond, remarked commentators, although deployment of the death brolly has more of a Mr Bean ring to it. The gadget, named the ParaPactum and manufactured in France by Le Parapluie de Cherbourg, was invented in 2011 and is intended, in the words of its makers, for the “protection des hautes personnalités”, including the president of the republic. It weighs more than twice a regular umbrella, is made of Kevlar, costs €10,000 (£8,400), and when brandished can ward off knife, dog, acid and fruit attacks. It’s also waterproof. Outside of France, the ParaPactum has been seen in the hands of protection officers walking alongside Vladimir Putin, and lest an umbrella should seem an insufficiently rugged piece of kit, comes in a special case that looks like it was made for a sniper. Pure jingoism, this, but given the long, almost spiritual relationship between the British people and their umbrellas, one imagines no modern technology is necessary for the average British protection officer to weaponise a standard-issue model with a wooden handle – cracked over-the-head, Grandma Giles-style. Girls don’t like physics because it entails “hard maths” is a statement I find simultaneously appalling and also identify with. I don’t like hard maths, or any maths, but that is not, obviously, because I’m a girl. Mid-week, the government’s social mobility commissioner chose to frame the low numbers of girls relative to boys taking physics A-Level in terms available only to those who’ve given the matter exactly seven minutes thought. Appearing before the Commons science and technology committee, Katharine Birbalsingh pulled words from her brain to the effect that, “physics isn’t something that girls tend to fancy. They don’t want to do it, they don’t like it.” Birbalsingh is headteacher at a school in Wembley where girls take physics A-Level at an even lower rate than the national average. Pressed to expand on her point, she took up a bigger shovel and resumed digging, continuing: “I just think they don’t like it. There’s a lot of hard maths in there that I think they would rather not do. The research generally … just says that’s a natural thing.” Per Birbalsingh’s example, a facility for evolutionary biology is not a girl’s best friend, either. On the other hand, Brownies are learning to code, which is great, although it won’t rescue me from the chill of my Brownie pack memories. The acquisition of badges left me so defeated I graduated from Wendover Second pack with a single badge (the hostess badge). Even then, I never met the target of learning to make a cup of tea – my mother, scandalously, signing the form to say she’d witnessed the event when she’d done no such thing. I hated Brownies, the uniform, the singing, the “mission”, whatever that was; the feral pack from Milton Keynes with whom we were made to go on camp. And although I rose to the heady height of Seconder in Gnomes, it never gave me any joy. You’d think it would be impossible to fail a Brownie badge, but I did, over-reaching one Thursday night in the direction of the Collectors Badge. Other Brownies brought in shells, and dolls, and rocks. I brought in my collection of lolly sticks, washed and dried, and the look on the face of Tawny Owl has never fully left me. Twist me and turn me and show me the elf ... Two touching stories of the ultra-elderly this week, one about the French nun Sister Andrew, who became, at 118, the oldest person in the world after the death earlier in the week of 119-year-old Kane Tanaka from Japan. Sister Andrew lived through the Spanish flu of 1918 and in January last year became the oldest known survivor of Covid-19. She told reporters this week she drinks a glass of wine every day, while Tanaka, shortly before her death, cheerfully told visitors she ascribed her great longevity to “being myself”, and her love of eating chocolate and drinking Coke. Given the mould these stories tend to take, it’s amazing neither of them smoked 40 a day or lived exclusively on a diet of bacon. Fascination inspired by the extremely old may lessen as their numbers increase. Japan has the oldest population in the world, with an average life span of 87.7 for women and 81.6 for men, and with 86,000 people currently over the age of 100. The thought of carrying on for 110-plus years, even in the apparently sprightly guise of Sister Andrew and the late Japanese record-holder, fills one with existential dread, particularly in the US where the logistics of funding a thirty-plus-year retirement are truly terrifying. If 50 is the new 40, and 70 the new 60, one awaits, with weary resignation, the advent of 90-plus as a marketing demographic, with all the attendant expectations of jauntiness. In the old days, it was BMW drivers who were reliably the worst on the road. Times change. We have a rental car this week and it’s noticeable that every time someone cuts in front, carves us up, or glides up the hard shoulder to jump the line, it’s more often than not the same car. Mercedes drivers are arrogant but rule-abiding. The gentle sorts in a Subaru always give way. A Honda Accord might drift over its lane-markings, but won’t give you any serious trouble. It’s Tesla drivers – on the road, on the internet, in real and in notional form – who are the absolute horror show, a brand affiliation that, no one needs reminding this week, goes all the way to the top.",News/UK news,Digested week: Teslas strip BMW drivers of proud title of worst on road | Emma Brockes,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/29/digested-week-bmw-drivers-lose-proud-title-worst-on-road-tesla
4/29/2022,"Startling and audacious in its conception, Tim Foley’s play collides religion and technology, ritual and algorithms, tradition and innovation. A Bruntwood prize for playwriting winner in 2017, and only just receiving its premiere now, it is a brilliant example of what the competition should be all about. As the play opens, St Grace’s Convent is in trouble. The mother superior has died, the coffers are almost empty and morale is low. In desperation, Elizabeth, the new acting mother, brings in Mary – a council-funded robot who divides opinion among the sisters. But could she be the miracle they all need? Like its narrative, Foley’s play is a crucible of old and new. At its heart is a relatively traditional, character-driven comedy drama about an isolated group of women confronted with a newcomer. As played by an excellent cast, the petty squabbles and power struggles of a community facing obsolescence are all deeply believable and often very funny. But this reality is unsettled by eruptions of the strange and otherworldly, whether in the form of robotics or spirituality. In the best sci-fi tradition, Foley limits the outlines of his near-future world to tantalising hints about altered seasons, automated workers and restless Luddites. The action stays confined to the convent, with turmoil shimmering on the horizon. The play is less concerned with the specificities of this world and more interested in what artificial intelligence means for the essential business of being human. Director Jaz Woodcock-Stewart amplifies the wonder and intrigue of this story, maximising its ambiguities and moments of awe while drawing on the inherent theatricality of Catholicism. The robot at the drama’s centre, meanwhile, is played with uncanny precision by Breffni Holahan, who conveys Mary’s not-quite-humanness with subtle tilts of the head and eerie vocal inflections. The great unravelling of the play’s second act, with its revelations both heavenly and human, occasionally feels overdone. There’s a lot crammed in here, between the visions seen, the secrets revealed and the outside world that starts knocking at the convent door. But it’s thrilling to see a new play of such ambition and ingenuity.

4/29/2022,"Good morning. Russia hit Kyiv with cruise missile strikes hours after Joe Biden announced the US would double its military and economic aid to Ukraine. The attacks took place while the UN secretary general was visiting the city, leading Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to call for a “strong response”, saying the strikes “say a lot about Russia’s true attitude to global institutions”. At least 10 people were injured, Ukrainian state emergency officials said. Zelenskiy said the attacks on Kyiv and other cities “prove that we cannot let our guard down”. Thursday’s strikes came hours after Biden asked Congress to grant immediate approval for spending that would include more than $33bn in military aid, $8.5bn in economic aid to Kyiv and $3bn in humanitarian relief. The UK is sending 8,000 troops to take part in exercises across eastern Europe – one of the largest deployments since the cold war. Zelenskiy said Russian forces came close to capturing or assassinating him within hours of the invasion. The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack is expected to issue letters asking key Republican figures, including House minority leader Kevin McCarthy and around a dozen others, to appear before the panel voluntarily, sources close to the matter said. The list has not yet been finalized, but two sources said that Scott Perry, Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Mo Brooks, Lauren Boebert, Andy Biggs, as well as some Republican senators, are being considered. The panel is understood to be particularly interested in McCarthy after it emerged this week he had told the Republican leadership that days after the Capitol attack Donald Trump admitted at least partial responsibility to him. When will the letters be sent? Either this week or next week, according to the sources. The list is expected to be authorized as soon as this week. Have they been asked to testify before? It would be the second time McCarthy, Jordan and Perry are requested to appear. What if the figures don’t cooperate? The panel will then consider ways to compel them to: subpoenas are no longer off the table. The premier of the British Virgin Islands, Andrew Fahie, has been arrested in Miami on charges of conspiring to import cocaine into the US and money laundering during a sting operation. The BVI governor, John Rankin, confirmed Fahie had been arrested on Thursday morning and called for calm. Fahie was involved in conspiracy to import at least 5kg of cocaine and money laundering from 16 October last year, court papers filed in Florida alleged. Were others arrested? Oleanvine Maynard, the manager director of the BVI’s port authority, and her son Kadeem were also detained. How were they caught? Fahie and Maynard were arrested at a Miami airport after being invited by undercover agents to see the $700,000 that BVI officials expected to receive. Dozens of people in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi reported seeing a remarkably bright meteor on Wednesday after hearing loud booms. It was first sighted 54 miles (87km) above the Mississippi River, near Alcorn, Mississippi, Nasa said. Elon Musk has sold nearly $4bn-worth (£3.2bn) of Tesla shares since reaching his $44bn Twitter deal. The sales, on Tuesday and Wednesday, came as Tesla’s share price nosedived amid investor fears Musk would sell to finance the deal. An American family flying back from Israel caused a bomb scare after they showed security an unexploded bombshell they were planning to bring back as a souvenir. Panicked passengers fled the area, with one man hospitalized for his injuries. The number of Algerians reaching Spain in small boats in 2021 rose by a fifth. Residents such as 65-year-old Nouara are considering this dangerous route if the legal option is closed to them: “If plan A doesn’t work, illegal migration will be my last refuge.” Almost 5bn medications are prescribed annually in the US, and Americans on average have about 12 prescriptions a year. This may be having an impact on marine populations: when Dr Jennifer Rehage, a fish ecologist and associate professor at Florida International University, set out to learn why bonefish numbers are dropping, her team found all 93 fish they sampled tested positive for at least one drug. The seemingly endless expansion of highways in Texas has provoked anger from residents, who last week protested against plans for roads that will displace residents as well as as churches, schools and businesses. While highways are expanded, the state is obstructing local initiatives encouraging cycling and walking, and residents say public transport options are limited. Could the state’s “car-centric status quo” be beginning to shake? Former leaders of Pacific nations have warned that the climate crisis, not rising military tensions, pose the biggest threat to their region. Pacific nations are often seen as acting as a bellwether for the climate emergency, which is already causing migration away from some island groups. During the strange early days of lockdown, many got into baking, along with other hobbies that fell by the wayside within months (if not weeks).

4/29/2022,"Sticky, juicy mangoes are a summer fruit favourite and, as early as May, the much-coveted alphonso variety comes into season. Once ripe, sliced mango can be served simply by itself or with just a squeeze of lime – and, as the writer Nikesh Shukla puts it, “a delicious mango can make you forget, for the time it takes to eat it, that the world is a depressing place right now”. But the mango’s smooth flesh and honeyed flavour lend themselves to a variety of sweet and savoury dishes and drinks. With this in mind, 10 top chefs and drinks experts tell us how they like to use this delectable fruit. Juliette Larrouy, head of bars at Two Schmucks, Barcelona Pick fresh, ripe mangoes, put the flesh in the blender then strain the pulp. Mix with a simple sugar syrup, one part mango to one part syrup. Heat coconut milk with basmati rice – you don’t want to cook the rice, just infuse the milk with a rice flavour. It’s best to do this in bulk: for 1 litre of coconut milk, use 100g of rice. Add 50ml infused coconut milk to 40ml of the mango syrup and shake with a pinch of salt, 10ml lemon juice, 45ml your choice of spirit – I like cognac but you can also use rum – and plenty of ice. Then strain and serve. Gina Hopkins, head chef at The Spread Eagle, London When mangos have gone soft and they’re just dripping juice, I like to make them into a hot sauce. Blitz the flesh of one big mango with 2tbsp white vinegar, ½tsp salt, and chillies – the chilli you use, and how much, will affect the kind of sauce you have. You can go for habaneros, which have a fruity heat that’s great with mango, or jalapeños, which are less spicy but bring a nice herbaceousness. If you want a smoky sauce, go for the chipotle chilli. It’s really customisable and good on eggs at breakfast, or tacos or rice dishes – it’s a great all-rounder! Paul Ainsworth, chef-patron at Paul Ainsworth at No 6, Padstow The best mango I’ve ever had was an alphonso mango. It was a deep orange colour and tasted phenomenal. When you’ve got produce like that, you can just serve it as is, with some vanilla madeleines and whipped cream. When mangoes are in season, I also make a lovely mango pavlova. I make individual meringues – not too sweet and packed full of vanilla – with alphonso mango and clotted cream. The cream brings a comforting dairy taste without sugar. I serve it with a passionfruit sauce, almost like a vinaigrette dressing, and some chopped fresh mint. Romuald Pokrywka, executive chef at Planet Organic, London This is a sweet, tangy, refreshing dish for a hot day – a mix of savoury and sweet. Make a dressing of 1 crushed garlic clove, 2tbsp grated ginger, 3tbsp tamari sauce, 1tbsp brown rice syrup, 1tbsp sesame oil and 1 tbsp brown rice vinegar. To make the salsa, dice the flesh of 1 mango and mix with a quarter of a chopped red onion, a handful of chopped coriander, 1 sliced red chilli, and mix with the juice of half a lime. Then build the bowls: 2 cups cooked quinoa for the base, topped with 200g marinated tofu, ½ cup edamame beans, 1 cup shredded red cabbage, four radishes and half an avocado. Add the salsa, then drizzle with the dressing. Serves two. Ronnie Bonetti, culinary director at Yoku, Cheltenham To make these “tacos”, cut a nori (dried edible seaweed) sheet into large rectangles and coat one side with a light, tempura-style batter (you can make this with cornflour and sparkling water). Shallow fry so it goes nice and crispy to form the taco base. Once cooled, dice up a quarter of a mango, 100g of fresh raw salmon, and divide both across three of the nori tacos. Brush with ponzu sauce (shop-bought, or make your own using orange juice, lemon juice, ginger, gluten-free soy sauce and a splash of mirin). Top with sliced spring onions and fresh coriander. Absolutely delicious. Liam Davy, head of bars at Hawksmoor, London, Manchester and Edinburgh Mango and tequila are a great combination. To make this version of a paloma, take 50ml good quality white tequila, 100ml mango kombucha (found in health food stores) and 100ml mango soda (like Rubicon). Mix in a tall glass with a squeeze of lime (about 10ml) and a good pinch of sea salt. Garnish with a slice of dried mango and a lime wedge on a cocktail stick. Mango can be a super-sweet flavour, but using kombucha in this drink makes it taste a little bit drier and a little bit more grown up. Mirella Pau, head chef at Tutto, Brighton (opens June) I first had this dish on holiday in Sicily – it’s so nice and fresh in the hot weather. Fruit with fish can seem odd, but this tastes fantastic. Take a 200g fillet of great amberjack fish and freeze for at least nine hours (to kill any bacteria). Before serving, defrost and slice very thinly, along with the flesh of half a mango. Combine one part aged balsamic vinegar with four parts extra virgin olive oil to make a dressing. On the plate, drizzle the fish and fruit slices with the dressing, then season with powdered coriander seeds, pink pepper and Maldon salt flakes. Top with two grated almonds and a little chopped dill. Surender Mohan, executive chef at Jamavar, London This lassi recipe makes the most of alphonso mangoes during their fleeting season and allows the fruit to really sing. Blend 300g alphonso mango pulp with 700g natural yoghurt and 30g sugar. Pour into two glasses and garnish with chopped alphonso mango and a sprig of mint. I enjoy drinking these on warm, spring days – they make the perfect sweet and cooling accompaniment to spicy dishes, such as laal maas (slow-cooked lamb shank with Rajasthani chilli). Sergio Cardeñosa, executive chef at Finca La Plaza and Mikasa, Ibiza This is a refreshing, colourful, vegan dish which is easy to prepare, too. The recipe is perfect for a party because it serves 10 people – and actually, making it in bulk like this is the best way to lock in the aromas. Simply mix together 170g chopped fresh coriander, 400g fresh lemon juice, 70g chopped green peppers, 70g cumin seeds, 90g yuzu, 250g fresh grated ginger, 2kg diced alphonso mango (with skins removed), 80g chopped jalapeños and 700g coconut yoghurt. Leave to marinade for 12 hours, then stir through 50g chopped fresh mint before serving with corn tortillas. Avinash Shashidhara, head chef at Pahli Hill, London For me, summer is all about mango. In India, where I grew up, there are more than 250 varieties – I remember going to the market with my grandfather and buying big bags of them. For this easy mango cheesecake, mix 175-200g crushed digestive biscuits with 100g melted butter, and press on to the base of a cake tin. Then, whisk together 450g cream cheese, 180g double cream and 175g caster sugar, before folding in 300g chopped alphonso mango. Soak two gelatine leaves in water until jelly-like, then place in a pan and gently melt. Once cooled, fold into the cheesecake mix before pouring on to the biscuit base. Set in the fridge for two to three hours, then decorate with sliced alphonso mangoes. The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

4/29/2022,"Communities across the US are using federal stimulus money to bring grocery stores and healthy food to food deserts, as the pandemic and rising costs put nutrition further out of reach for many. The regions using American Rescue Plan funds include Montana’s Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, a 1,000-sq-mile expanse shared by the Assiniboine and Gros Ventre tribes. Most of the reservation is considered a food desert by the US Department of Agriculture, meaning most residents have little access to healthy food. An Indigenous-owned company on the reservation plans to renovate and expand the Little River Trading Post, formerly part of the Kwik Stop chain, in the town of Fort Belknap Agency. The combination gas station and convenience store closed briefly after it was bought and then reopened in December selling apples, bananas, potatoes, onions and berries. “Our berries fly off the shelves,” said Eddie Moore, a business development officer who runs the store for the Island Mountain Development Group, which bought the business last year. It plans to use federal stimulus funds to expand its fresh produce offering this year. At least five other communities have proposed using money from the American Rescue Plan – the $1.9tn package approved by Congress in 2021 to help the country recover from the pandemic’s effects – to open or revive grocery stores, according to the US Treasury Department. A slew of other areas are looking at ways the funds could ease food insecurity. In Toledo, Ohio, local activists have urged the city to use $1m of the federal infrastructure funds to help attract a grocery store to a low-income neighborhood. Healthier food would help alleviate high obesity, cholesterol and blood pressure problems among Toledo’s Black population, said the Rev Donald Perryman, president of the Toledo advocacy group United Pastors for Social Empowerment. “When you have been an oppressed resident of our country in some of these disadvantaged neighborhoods, you develop some habits related to survival,” he said. “Sometimes those habits become embedded.” Black and Latinos are more likely to live in areas without grocery stores than white people, as are low-income people. The grocery model is broken and the federal funding offers new ways to fix it, said Beverley Wheeler, director of DC Hunger Solutions, which runs nutrition programs in the nation’s capital. “Our large grocery stores have a business model that’s built on education and income,” said Wheeler, who noted Washington DC plans to use American Rescue Plan funds to add smaller grocery stores to underserved neighborhoods this year. “They don’t build them in the neighborhoods where we need them.” It can be hard for a grocery store to make a profit even in affluent communities, so getting companies to stick around low-income neighborhoods is a challenge, said Connie Max, executive vice-president for lending with the Local Initiatives Support Corp, a non-profit that helps fund community projects. More communities are asking for help attracting or retaining grocers, Max said, with local governments and community non-profits gathering funds rather than waiting for companies to open stores on their own. “The margins are pretty thin on grocery stores,” she said. “Whenever we can, we try to help them to purchase the facility to really root them in the community.” But giving residents access to healthy food may not be as simple as opening a new grocery store. Toledo officials are trying to figure out what would help the most, especially in neighborhoods that have lost population. Less than half the population gets its groceries from grocery stores, said Sandy Spang, the city’s deputy economic development director, down from 90% in 1988. The city is surveying residents to see whether new grocery stores would be more useful than, say, food trucks or other prepared food options. “I think we need to recognize the distribution of food is changing,” Spang said. “I don’t think we can look at the solutions of 40 years ago. If you’ve lost density in neighborhoods, you’re not necessarily going to have feasibility for traditional grocery stores.” In Birmingham, Alabama, which is also researching ways to use ARP funds for healthier food options, the city paid to renovate an abandoned grocery store but realized it would need to divide the building in half to attract a new grocer because companies tend to prefer smaller stores. Residents surrounded by convenience and dollar stores have sorely missed having access to fresh foods such as produce, baked goods and seafood, said Carol Clarke, the city councilor who represents the neighborhood. “It is most assuredly a food desert,” she said. Other communities are also using ARP funds to ease food insecurity: The Cherokee Nation hopes to open a grocery store in Marble City, Oklahoma. “It’s important to ensure our Cherokee communities inside the reservation have access to healthy foods, especially in our rural areas where there are limited resources including grocery stores,” said Chuck Hoskin Jr, Cherokee Nation principal chief. Austin, Texas, where 12 of the city’s zip codes lack grocery stores, plans to open at least one pilot store in underserved eastern Austin. Macon-Bibb county, Georgia, is spending $1m on a grocery store in a low-income neighborhood. Memphis, Tennessee, and Washington DC, also plan to open ARP-funded stores, and Charleston, West Virginia, has proposed Miss Ruby’s Corner Market, which would take over the site of a former soda fountain near a senior housing complex where residents have trouble getting to grocery stores further away. The non-profit store will carry local produce and offer nutrition education, said Spencer Moss, executive director of the West Virginia Food & Farm Coalition, which is helping to open the business. “We don’t need to make a profit,” she said. “We just need to break even.”",News/Environment,Food desert regions use federal funds to bring healthy food to communities ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/29/us-food-deserts-federal-stimulus-funds
4/29/2022,"Sewing and textiles have always been a part of the artist Aram Han Sifuentes’ life. Her South Korean immigrant parents operated a dry cleaning business, and she mended her own clothing from a young age. But it wasn’t until she began learning more about immigrant justice and social justice, while making art on the side, that she saw the connection between textiles and her passion for political action. She went on to turn it into a career, using textile tools and materials, along with communal workshops, to put that intersection in the spotlight. The radical power of sewing is the subject of a new exhibition in Los Angeles, on view through 4 September. The show, titled Talking Back to Power: Projects by Aram Han Sifuentes, will include works by the artist such as a sculpture comprised of safety pins; quilts made from clothing scraps that she gathered during interviews with immigrant garment workers; and conversation-sparking protest banners made of fabric. The exhibition comes as the fashion world grapples with issues from worker exploitation to environmental harms. Sewing is often dismissed as a feminine and domestic act, but the reality is that garment workers – often immigrant women, people of color or those who are incarcerated – power a billion-dollar global industry. Sifuentes said she sees a clear “​​absence of an acknowledgment about who’s doing the sewing and the garment work right now in this country”, and hopes her work can shift that. For example, her US Citizenship Test Sampler Project, a project first established in 2015, turns the classic embroidery sampler, a traditional tool for teaching needlework, into a method of empowerment and critique. Non-citizen participants created samplers during workshops and some of these pieces are in the exhibition, with information on who created them and in what year. The samplers sell for $725, the price of a US citizenship application fee, and the proceeds go to the person who created the piece. Talking Back to Power also includes works that build on Sifuentes’s themes by exploring the historical experiences of immigrant garment workers. In one gallery, Skirball curator Laura Mart said, a 1990s Hamish Amish Immigration Quilt by the Hamish Amish Quilters references “immigration stories of Jewish Americans as made by their descendants”. Many Jewish immigrants who came to the US in the late 19th and early 20th century worked in the garment industry, Mart said, and the quilt’s placement across Sifuentes’ work makes a clear connection to her work. In addition, “Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrants, and women activists, were really important in advocating for unionized workplaces in the garment industry,” Mart said, referencing the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire and subsequent formation of the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union (ILGWU). Sifuentes’ work ultimately connects the political with the personal: Safety Pins, a piece that took years to produce, is made up of found items and scraps from her parents’ dry cleaning business, stitched into a mandala (a reference to the artist’s Buddhist culture). “Of course I’m going to use this medium because at the very core, for me, and my personal lived experience, this is about my identity as an immigrant of color,” she said of using her upbringing to inform her work. Sifuentes is known for making her political art interactive and the Skirball show includes an ongoing project titled Protest Banner Lending Library, which invites people to come together to design fabric banners adorned with political slogans. Under Sifuentes’ guidance, participants learn new techniques with tools such as sewing machines and irons on hand. They can keep their banners or donate them to the library for someone else to use. Visitors to the Skirball exhibition can check out a banner, returning it when they’re done using it at a protest or demonstration. Monthly workshops will also take place. During a recent member preview, one museum-goer checked out a banner protesting against the war in Ukraine. He wrapped it around himself, like a cloak, and walked around the space with it for the rest of his visit. “With Aram’s work, what is so interesting is that the artwork itself is really more than the object,” said Mart. “It’s the experience. It’s the participation aspect of it. It’s the activism aspect of it. And it’s the community aspect of it.” In past versions of the lending library, Sifuentes said that people exchanged information on future protests and shared what their chosen slogan meant to them. The banners take on a life of their own once they leave the space, encouraging participants to consider marginalised groups and re-imagine the act of sewing as a tool for speaking out. “We can come together, have our voices heard, and have these banners available for people to check out and sort of be allies or co-conspirators,” said Sifuentes. “[They can] carry the voices of the vulnerable communities and people who don’t necessarily feel safe attending a protest.”",Arts/Art and design,The radical power of sewing: the artist turning textiles into activism,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/29/aram-han-sifuentes-artist-exhibit-talking-back-to-power
4/29/2022,"As a very small child, I returned from a weekend in Cromer with not only a collection of sea shells and a new bucket and spade, but an exceptionally broad Norfolk accent. At first, everyone found this highly amusing, but it was less funny when I was still talking that way several weeks later. My mother tells me a similar thing happened when they took me to Wales. And North Yorkshire. Because, like a sponge, I soaked up whichever accent I was exposed to. It wasn’t just accents, either. As a five-year-old, during a particularly boisterous garden game with a friend, I ran into the kitchen sobbing hysterically and clutching my hand. ‘“Whatever have you done to yourself?” my mother said. “It’s not me!” I frantically rubbed my wrist. “It’s Susan! She’s fallen over!” Because Susan’s pain was my pain and I felt it just as keenly as if I’d done the damage to myself. Back then, we didn’t have a name for this subconscious appropriation of other people’s emotions (and accents), but now it’s fashionably referred to as being an empath. Or in some cases, a hyper-empath. Relating to someone else’s pain is a natural human response; we’re all empaths to a degree. But hyper-empaths are different. Do you sob when people win a large amount of money on a quizshow? Do you start to feel queasy if someone says they feel sick? Hyper-empaths take everything on (noise, colour, conversation), so often find crowds overwhelming. Of course, there are many reasons why we might be flooded with emotion, but hyper-empaths are so tuned in to other people’s feelings that the sensation of taking on someone else’s experience is unmistakable. We do it quietly, though, not to draw in sympathy, or make “everything about ourselves”. Often we disguise it so cleverly that our own struggles may go unnoticed. Labelling yourself isn’t always helpful (once you’ve stuck one on, it can be difficult to remove) but understanding the idea of hyper-empathy might explain why life sometimes leave you emotionally exhausted. At first glance, a tendency to relate to others so keenly is wholly positive. “You’re so compassionate,” people say whenever I complain. The problem is that, along with your own issues, you end up dragging everyone else’s pain and anguish around as well, which can actually be quite draining. I’ve also been accused of thinking I’m special because I claim to feel everything very deeply. But hyper-empathy is so much more than caring and feeling, and the navigation of extreme emotional reactions is tiring. Compassion and empathy are positive qualities, but there is a tipping point. Kerry Daynes, consultant psychologist and best-selling author, says empathy (like many sweet things) is fantastic in moderation but debilitating in excess: “As a forensic psychologist, often working on cases involving horrendous acts, I often find myself flooded with empathy. If I allowed it to, it would lead at best to some bad practice and decisions on my part, and at worst complete incapacitation.” It’s a tricky balance, one I battled with constantly when I was a junior doctor. I eventually specialised in psychiatry for six years, where the balance was easier, and though now I’m a full-time writer, the memory of those days is still vivid. I remember watching my consultant deliver devastating news to a patient, and the many crash calls I rushed to proving futile. I could no longer run sobbing to my mum, so, on a regular basis, I would lock myself in a toilet cubicle at the Staffordshire teaching hospital, and very quietly cry. I found working with elderly patients especially distressing, because they were often alone, and I found nothing more upsetting than an empty plastic chair at a bedside during visiting hours. Hyper-empaths relate heavily to other people, and perhaps the isolation I so often saw in older patients was something I could also see in myself. Medicine was an unexpectedly lonely job. I envied people who could leave it all behind at the hospital gates at the end of a shift, because I took everything home with me. There were no doctors in my family, and although my mum and partner were supportive, it’s difficult to explain to someone else how it feels to walk the wards. My concentration was shot to pieces and the things that usually brought me comfort – watching a film or reading – became impossible. Instead, I would sit and ruminate, turning over the day’s events in my mind, even ringing the wards on my day off to see how a patient was doing. My hyper-empathy was at it outside work, too. In a supermarket queue, I once overheard a complete stranger discussing a lost dog. I was so upset for this woman, I spent five hours at home trawling internet rescue centres trying to locate it. (The dog came home, by the way – which I’m telling you because I know there will be fellow hyper-empaths reading who will be worried about it.) It seems counterintuitive that people with hyper-empathy would work in a job where they’re exposed to extraordinary amounts of suffering, but the caring professions are knee-deep in empaths. Perhaps the ability to understand someone else’s pain means we’re especially driven to try to help them, to fix things. But it didn’t take me long to realise there are many things we are unable to fix. It’s a difficult lesson for an empath. The desire to help someone is overwhelming and, on a slightly less altruistic level, if you can make someone else feel better, you will – by default – start to feel much better yourself. This was never more apparent than with one palliative care patient I met. Even thinking of her now makes me catch my breath. We were exactly the same age and we’d grown up in the same part of the world. We knew the same lyrics to the same songs, and we’d spent our teenage years with the same posters on our bedroom walls. If ever there was a patient to bring out my excess of empathy, it was her. The difference between us was that she had metastatic breast cancer and I did not. I was involved in her care for a long time, and I had the great privilege of sitting with her as she died. It was a moment I will never forget, and it made me realise I had to do something about my hyper-empathy or I would go under. Daynes says it’s more useful to think of it as “rational compassion”, a concept which originated with author and psychologist Paul Bloom. She says it’s important to separate “feeling for” (the logical quality of caring for others and being concerned about their wellbeing) from “feeling with” (which epitomises empathy, and can be the component that trips us up). If we can let go of the feeling with, but retain the feeling for, we’ve pretty much cracked it. The trick is identifying an incoming emotion, making a decision as to whether it’s useful, and adjusting our reaction accordingly. If you’re angry about animal cruelty, volunteer as a dog walker at your local animal shelter (there is always a need); if the report of a serious road accident upsets you, write to your local council about speed cameras. “It’s bloody hard, though,” Daynes admits. It really is. I had no coping strategies as a doctor, and this was why I started to write. I sat in my car in my lunch break and began to write a story about two little girls in the summer of 1976 that eventually became The Trouble with Goats and Sheep. At the time, it was just an escape and I didn’t ever imagine being published, but gradually, the same empathy that left me sobbing in a public toilet helped me become a better writer. I channelled my emotions into something positive, and feeling them so strongly I found I could walk in the shoes of my characters. With a little concentration, I could almost think myself into being someone else. The story I wrote as therapy won a competition, which led to a publishing contract, and being an empath became very useful when I started to earn a living making up stories. I still volunteered on the wards, though. I could never let go of a job I loved so much. Being a hyper-empath isn’t all pain and misery. We can make great listeners, and great friends, because we understand others. We’re probably the first person you’ll ring when you’re having a bad day. We also have superb intuition: that gut feeling we get about something … most of the time it’s right. People often describe me as oversensitive, but I’ve always thought that was a strange phrase. Like saying a tree is over-green. I still have a thing with accents, though. A few weeks ago, our Australian neighbour knocked on the door, asking for a favour. As she thanked me and walked back down the drive, I shouted “No worries, mate!” at the top of my voice, like I was auditioning for a part in Neighbours. I wasn’t taking the mickey, honestly. I’m just … quite absorbent. Step back from the situationWhether that’s walking away from a conversation, taking a break or simply turning off the news. If you have time, allow yourself a rant or a cry. “If you don’t/can’t, bookmark it for later,” says Daynes. “No good ever comes from bottling things up.” Try rationalising how you’re feelingThe simplest way to do this is to identify a feeling, then ask yourself if that emotion is actually useful. Work out if there’s something practical you can doIf you’re upset about something, try channelling your feeling into action: sharing a petition, making a donation or even doing voluntary work. Allow yourself to do something enjoyable without feeling guiltFor all of us (empaths or not), the landscape of the world can feel almost unbearable – but self-care and finding joy are still important. “We’re no good to anyone if we’re an emotional heap,” says Daynes, “and if we take care of ourselves, we can still affect the world in a positive way.” Walk the dog, read a book, watch the sunset. Remember that not everyone is a hyper-empathSo if you’re excessively worried about someone or something, or feel too keenly about another person’s situation, chances are they’re more OK than you probably realise.

4/29/2022,"New York’s highest court on Wednesday dealt national Democrats a major setback in their quest to keep control of the US House, when it struck down the state’s 26 congressional districts because they were illegally distorted in favor of Democrats. New York is critical for Democrats in the decennial process of redrawing congressional districts. The state’s 26 seats offer the party one of the richest opportunities to use mapmaking power to their advantage. Democrats currently have a 19-8 advantage in the congressional delegation, but drew a map that gives them three additional seats, increasing their advantage to 22-4 (New York is losing a congressional seat because of population loss). It would give the party 85% of the congressional seats in a state Joe Biden won with about 61% of the vote. Democrats saw that advantage as a necessary effort to counter aggressive Republican efforts to distort district lines to add Republican-friendly seats in places like Florida, Texas, Tennessee and Georgia. “For Democrats, a maximal gerrymander in New York was almost a prerequisite to any chances of holding the House,” said Dave Wasserman, a redistricting expert at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Over the past few months, observers have noted that the redistricting process appeared to be going unexpectedly well for Democrats, who were buoyed by a mix of court rulings striking down Republican gerrymandered districts and anti-gerrymandering reforms. Some predicted that redistricting would end in a “partisan wash” or potentially even a balanced US House. Now, that looks increasingly unlikely. “A couple of months ago redistricting looked like a silver lining in an otherwise bleak election cycle for Democrats. Today, it looks like just another Republican bonus,” he said. “Democrats can’t catch a break.” Overall, Republicans are poised to pick up between four and five in the House this year, according to FiveThirtyEight. Republicans need to flip five Democratic-held seats to take control of the House. The ruling in New York, which could cost Democrats three seats, comes just after Florida governor Ron DeSantis successfully pushed an aggressively gerrymandered map that adds four additional GOP seats. The Florida map is already being challenged in state court – voting and civic action groups say the Florida plan obviously violates language in the state constitution prohibiting partisan gerrymandering. But Florida Republicans have firm control of the state supreme court, making any legal challenge an uphill battle. Meanwhile, the New York ruling is one of several redistricting decisions this year that underscore the increasingly important role state courts are playing in policing partisan gerrymandering. Last month, a court in Maryland struck down the state’s congressional map, also as being too gerrymandered in favor of Democrats. State courts in North Carolina, Kansas and Ohio have all struck down congressional districts as too distorted in favor of the GOP (the Ohio court let a revised map stand for 2022 even though voting rights groups said they were still too biased). Overall, Republicans have been able to get away with gerrymandering far more districts than Democrats have. Shorter 2022 redistricting: it's permissible to brazenly gerrymander in some states (mostly red), but not others (mostly blue). As long as that's true, you're not going to end up with a ""fair"" or ""equitable"" national House map. States on track for GOP gerrymanders: AL, AR, FL, GA, IN, KY, LA, OH, OK, SC, TN, TX, UT (152 districts)States on track for Dem gerrymanders: IL, MD, MA, NV, NM, OR, RI (49 districts) “The fact that Maryland and New York were struck down and Florida, Ron DeSantis went into attack mode totally wipes away what Democrats had hoped.” There still is a little bit of uncertainty about what the partisan breakdown of New York’s congressional delegation will ultimately look like. The court of appeals appointed a special master to draw the districts by mid May and moved the state’s primary from June until August. Democrats may also appeal the ruling to the US supreme court, which has suggested in recent cases that courts cannot make changes to maps when an election is near. Even though Republicans have gerrymandered districts much more aggressively in recent years, the New York ruling also offered an embarrassing rebuke for Democrats, who have led national efforts to rein in severe partisan gerrymandering. The four justice majority said state Democrats had ignored a 2014 constitutional amendment, approved by voters, that adopted anti-gerrymandering language and put a bipartisan commission in charge of the process. Democrats drew the districts after the bipartisan commission failed to produce a plan. Chief Judge Janet DiFiore, who wrote the majority opinion for the court of appeals, rejected the idea that lawmakers could essentially come up with their own plan if the commission failed. Doing so, she wrote, would make the commission “nothing more than ‘window dressing’ masquerading as meaningful reform”.",News/US news,‘Democrats can’t catch a break’: election maps setback spells midterms trouble,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/29/democrats-midterms-new-york-election-maps-court
4/29/2022,"Why will I love it?A rose in succulent form, echeveria “fabiola” is found in mountainous terrain in Mexico. Its rosette shape and pastel tones make it a pretty delight for any home, with the bonus of becoming even more attractive when it blooms. Light or shade?Bright light. Where should I put it?On a sunny, south-facing windowsill. How do I keep it alive?Full sunlight will ensure the beautiful leaf colour and overall healthy appearance of echeveria, so avoid shade. Without enough light, they can become “leggy” (stretched from trying to reach light), form a long stem and eventually topple over. However, at temperatures above 30C or in very intense sunlight it will need shade and extra ventilation; otherwise, the leaves will scorch or dry out. Plant in free-draining soil. Water weekly in the summer and reduce in the winter months, making sure it always dries out between watering. It can be easier to water these plants underneath, as stagnant water pooling on the leaves can damage them.

4/29/2022,"Shortly before Christmas, when Foals were discussing potential places to shoot a new video, Ukraine topped the list. Frontman Yannis Philippakis had gone travelling there alone when he was 18 and still has a “kind of map of what it was like then permanently in my head”. In more recent years, when Foals had played some shows there, Kyiv had been just as he remembered it: a beautiful, peace-loving city that loved a party. The band were keen to work with Tanu Muiño, an acclaimed Ukranian-Cuban director who has worked with Lil Nas X, Cardi B, the Weeknd and Harry Styles – she turned out to be a Foals fan, and so an old industrial courtyard workspace was scouted for the shoot. At that point, Russian tanks had just started gathering on the border but, as Philippakis remembers, “the idea of it turning into a full-scale war seemed pretty remote”. They shot the joyously choreographed video for 2am in January, after which they watched some ice skating, visited bars, hung out with the crew and talked politics. A perfect day ended with hugs and group photos. “The optimism that day was captured in the video,” says the singer, wistfully. “It’s strange to think how quickly that’s been brutalised.” Since the Russian invasion – after which Foals cancelled upcoming shows in Moscow and St Petersburg – the band have found it difficult to contact the Ukrainians they spent time with. “There are people in our video who are now having to shelter for their lives or pick up rifles to defend their city,” Philippakis says. “The choreographer left a message saying that she and her husband were having to hide from shelling.” I meet Foals in March at their small rented studio, rehearsal room and writing space in Peckham, London, cradling coffees. “It certainly feels weird to be doing promo,” admits guitarist Jimmy Smith, his newly dyed blond hair reflecting his current status as an Englishman who lives in Los Angeles. Nor is it lost on them that the album we’re here to talk about – the seventh and best of their career – is a euphoric party record, worthy of a band whose last album reached No 1 and are billed high in this summer’s Glastonbury and Latitude lineups, warming up with four sold-out nights in London’s Olympia this weekend. Life Is Yours – full of sunny, motorik disco/house-influenced dancefloor fillers such as Wake Me Up and the sublime upcoming single 2001 – is being compared to Talking Heads, LCD Soundsystem and 80s Duran Duran. With more keyboards and fewer guitars, its ecstatic, air-punching vibe couldn’t be further from the horrors of Ukraine, the pandemic, climate change or economic crisis. Philippakis expains that when they made 2019’s brace of socially conscious albums, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost (Parts 1 and 2), “the climate crisis suddenly seemed upon us and there were books coming out about the sixth mass extinction. It felt right to engage with the threat on the horizon.” However, while Life Is Yours is also a response to the post-Covid world in which there’s what he describes as “an everyday jeopardy or darkness now that’s impossible to ignore”, this time the mood is uplifting. “It was written in the midst of lockdowns,” the quietly wellspoken singer explains, sporting a DH Lawrence beard and wearing the same sort of loosely fitting shirt he wears on stage. “Winter, grey, no life on the streets. So we’d come here and shelter from all that by writing music that felt escapist and joyful, but also hopeful for the future to come back.” When the pandemic struck, Foals managed to do one date of an Asian tour in February 2020 before concerts suddenly started being cancelled. “We didn’t know what the fuck was going on,” says Philippakis. “You think: ‘Oh, this will soon blow over’, but it didn’t.” After making it back to the UK it was nice to spend unexpected time at home – the band had kept them from seeing partners – but the singer remembers the “surreal strangeness” of the first lockdown. “We’ve all grown up on apocalypse movies like Contagion, World War Z or whatever. So there was that aspect of engaging with something we’ve all been worried about.” Jack Bevan, the band’s well-groomed, amiable, gently self-effacing drummer, was one of the very first in the UK with Covid. On returning from Asia, he came down with “basically the worst flu I ever had. After about 10 days I started to feel a bit better, but then had pneumonia symptoms for a week and then this sort of extreme fatigue for about a month. This was well before lockdown, when Covid was a mystery to people here. I was just watching the news, with all these horrifying statistics and cases from abroad. So there was no reassurance of how this thing would go.” Smith, meanwhile, escaped to LA to see his girlfriend, got stuck there during lockdown (hence his now full-time US residence) and contracted Covid too. “It was in my lungs for a month,” he says. “It was certainly enough of a shock to make me quit smoking.” When the band eventually regrouped in Peckham, playing for hours every day became a way of blocking out what was going on outside. Foals made Life Is Yours as a trio. In 2018, co-founding bassist Walter Gervers, the band’s most stable “father figure” and counsel in times of strife, left suddenly to start a family. Last year’s exit of another founder, keyboard player Edwin Congreave, was less unexpected but equally significant. He had been doing an Open University degree with a view to studying at Cambridge and, as Philippakis explains, was finding it hard to reconcile the boozing and adrenaline of a touring lifestyle with academia. “Poor Edwin,” Smith says, chuckling. “We’d come tumbling on to the bus at 3am and he’d be in the back lounge with his papers, trying to study for a 9am exam.” The remaining members insist the departures have strengthened their own bonds, but such lineup changes can play havoc with a group’s dynamic, especially losing people they’ve played with for 15 years. “It can be destabilising,” Philippakis admits as we’re on a second round of coffees. “And you miss them as a social presence. Getting to spend your life with your friends is a beautiful way to spend your time, so when anyone goes you think: we’re never going to spend that much time with that person again.” This partly explains why Life Is Yours occasionally has a more wistful undercurrent. All Foals albums are different – whether the “career gamble” of 2010’s ambitious Total Life Forever or the heavier terrain of 2015’s What Went Down. In a way, Life Is Yours recalls the giddy energy of their 2008 debut Antidotes, but viewed through a rear-view mirror. “We were thinking back to when we started,” Philippakis, who is now 35, reflects, referring to their days (after originally meeting in Oxford) as a math-rock band living in a Peckham squat dubbed Squallyoaks, sharing takeaways and playing “feral parties” in the squat scene. “There was optimism that isn’t really around any more. It was a golden era of nightlife: great clubs, house music, pre-social media and smartphones, all the cross-pollinations in music, art, dance. I think on songs such as [Life Is Yours track] Looking High there is a wistfulness, now that clubs are closing down. When we were making the album we were gagging to experience life, so you find yourself thinking about old parties and times when you could lose yourself in a moment.” Foals re-emerge into a very different climate from the one that they started out in in 2004, one of the print NME, CD singles and a thriving circuit of live bands and smaller venues. “There’s loads of positives to social media and the internet,” says Philippakis, idly strumming a Spanish guitar, “but one thing that has been destructive has been the ravaging of the geographical architecture around music: local venues, record stores, affordable rehearsal spaces and studios. It’s affected the way people make music communally, or the idea of making friends and making music together. Everything has migrated online, but if you walk around our cities, there’s no record shop, nowhere to make a racket. It’s all a bit bereft. When I was still at school I’d go to [club night] Trash in London every week and the Horrors or Arctic Monkeys or the Klaxons would be there, and it felt like everyone was part of something.” The idea of music as a communal experience is central to Foals and, ironically, partly why Congreave left. Having started touring in an old Royal Mail van, the keen environmentalist had become uncomfortable with the band’s carbon footprint. Foals do offset their carbon, but Smith argues that if a band wants to sustain a life and income – even one who unfurled a banner reading No Music on a Dead Planet at the 2019 Mercury prize – it’s impossible to avoid some environmental impact. “It’s not just income, though,” Philippakis says. “For me, the very core of being a musician isn’t sitting around in a studio. It’s performing and connecting with people.” He remembers a particular discussion with Congreave on the tour bus prior to their cancelled Asia tour. “He was saying: ‘We shouldn’t do these shows’ – not because of Covid, but because of the impact of a band flying thousands of miles. “We had a very frank and reasonable discussion, but in the end we said: ‘We want to be musicians.’ I’m more than happy to offset, but I wouldn’t want to be in this band if we weren’t playing shows.” The singer has become one of modern pop’s great livewire frontpersons – known to leap from high balconies into crowds or battle with security men trying to prevent him. “I actually stopped drumming at one gig because of what Yannis was up to,” Bevan chuckles. “You’d see him hanging off a balcony with security holding him by his belt buckle and think: ‘What’s he doing now?’” For the singer, who grew up on “provocative, high-wire” hardcore bands such as the Jesus Lizard, performing is a way of escaping his “everyday self. It’s really charged, and on stage the energy from the crowd and the physical volume and the booze becomes like a cyclone.” Foals read a recent Guardian article about how “hard-partying” bands have become outliers, but for them alcohol remains a part of touring. Philippakis has never done a show sober – Smith did, once – but has certainly seen peers fall by the wayside owing to the lifestyle. However, he points out that people who find making music cathartic or therapeutic might also have “certain psychological issues that make them more attracted to getting fucked up”. Bevan explains that the industry’s “high-pressure environment” can cause social drinking to become a “coping mechanism. If you were hungover at home, you’d spend the whole day under a duvet, but on tour you might have to play to 40,000 people. You have to power on and maybe have a few drinks to get through.” The drummer always performed sober until a panic attack on stage at the Faversham in Leeds in 2006 led him to reconsider, so now he allows himself “a couple of beers before a show”. Philippakis is upfront about enjoying drinking, but explains that it’s also a creative tool, especially with lyrics. “I tend to become quite unhealthy in the later stage of writing,” he admits, “and that usually continues until the end of tour. I couldn’t do a show without drinking.” Foals’s ideal is to keep the party going without risking the band. In 17 years, none of them has had a drug problem, and while they certainly enjoy a tipple, or several, Smith counsels: “It’s fundamentally a bad idea to drink your band into ruin.” So much has changed around them. When Antidotes came out, the UK had a Labour government and was in the EU. Philippakis – who has a Jewish South African mother and a Greek father – explains that Greece sees the EU as “an oppressor, something that was very punitive to the Greek people, but I understand that Brexit has been disastrous for the UK”. He despairs of the “rampant corruption” in parliament and argues that people are “waking up to the fact that we have a rightwing government” and expects a “bigger fury”. On Life Is Yours, Foals perhaps represent a generation – or several generations – who remember the good times, are bewildered and angered by the world today, and just want to be able to look forward with optimism once again. The idea was that Life Is Yours would coincide with the beginnings of a post-pandemic, brighter world, which – with war raging and prices soaring – seems further away than ever. “The spirit of an emerging new future isn’t here yet,” admits the singer, “which does add a weird extra poignancy to the album. But if it just never arrives, then hopefully we’ve made a great record that people can hide in and take solace in.”  Life Is Yours is released on 17 June on Warners.

4/29/2022,"Iunderstand, entirely, if you are a bit done with murderers – serial, one-offs, opportunistic, take your pick from the array forever before us on our screens. Or simple terrorisers of women. But I would urge, even if that is your current position, to give Shining Girls (Apple TV+) a try, though the premise may be unalluring. The premise, taken from the 2013 novel of nearly the same name by Lauren Beukes, is that six years ago, Kirby Mazrachi (Elisabeth Moss) survived a near-fatal attack by an unknown assailant who was never caught. Since then she has been experiencing shifting realities. Sometimes the alterations are small and a pet cat is now a pet dog, or she returns to a different desk at work; sometimes they are large and she finds her hot mess of a mother reborn in a more literal sense than usual as an evangelical Christian, or that Kirby herself is now married to a man called Marcus instead of still isolated and single. One constant is that she is always a newspaper archivist with the Sun Times (her story, which is more central than in the book, is set in early 90s Chicago), the closest she could manage to her ambition of becoming a reporter in the wake of the life-changing assault. When the body of a young woman with seemingly identical but this time fatal wounds to Kirby’s is discovered in the city’s sewers, she joins forces with reporter Dan (Wagner Moura) to investigate and track down what seems to be, despite impossible timelines crisscrossing decades, a serial killer. The viewer is far ahead of them here – possibly too far, making the pair seem slightly dim rather than dogged – because we have seen the mysterious man at work. The man is Harper (played very unsettlingly and very brilliantly by Jamie Bell) and he seems unstoppable as he chooses his next victim, astronomer Jin-Sook (Phillipa Soo), whose job hints at the physics and metaphysics that will play a part in unravelling the knotty plot. Moss is, as ever, ferociously intense and attentive to the minutest shift in her character’s mood or suffering. She is unflinching and unsentimental in every role she takes, and you couldn’t hope for a better anchor for a project that could easily otherwise become hokey. Time travel is frequently less of a high concept than a deep trap, which is why Russian Doll – also grounded by a powerhouse performance by a female lead – remains such a marvel. When you add Moss’s remarkable, nuanced performance to the slightly slow pacing and the audience being arguably too far ahead of the protagonists, Shining Girls works better as a character study than a thriller (though it’s certainly worth watching as the latter). Kirby’s constant renegotiation of a world that changes without notice or permission around her is as fine an evocation of the profound and lingering results of trauma as you’ll see. To live a life suddenly full of unknowns, with the familiar made unfamiliar, the trustworthy now tainted by terrible knowledge, is something anyone who has been assaulted will recognise. One reality is replaced by another and another and another as you take two steps forwards and one back towards a new normality. Even as the female victim count adds up, Shining Girls keeps its integrity and never backs away from this underlying truth.",Arts/Television & radio,Shining Girls review – Elisabeth Moss is perfect for this time-hopping thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/29/shining-girls-review-elizabeth-moss-apple-tv
