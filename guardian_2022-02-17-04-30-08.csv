2/17/2022,"San Francisco’s district attorney has dropped charges against a woman whose DNA collected from a rape kit was used to link her to a property crime, citing a violation of her constitutional rights. District attorney Chesa Boudin said his office learned that the city’s police were using DNA samples collected from sexual assault victims to identify possible suspects last week, and is calling for legislation to ban the practice.  “This practice treats victims like evidence, not human beings,” Boudin said Monday. ‘This is legally and ethically wrong.” Officials said the practice violated the defendants’ fourth amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government, and runs afoul of California’s Victims’ Bill of Rights. The woman’s DNA, which was collected in a rape exam as part of a domestic violence and sexual abuse case several years ago, was used to link her to a felony property crime in the city. Police identified her in the crime based on evidence from the rape exam, Boudin said. It was unclear whether any other sexual assault victims have been arrested for later crimes based on evidence submitted in a rape exam, Boudin said Monday. His office believes that one of the police’s DNA databases could include DNA profiles from rape victims collected over several years, and that this database is regularly used to search for matches to DNA found at crime scenes, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. San Francisco police chief Bill Scott said he asked the assistant chief for operations and the investigations bureau “to thoroughly review the matter and report back to me and to our DA’s office partners” as to the extent of the practice. Boudin also expressed concerns the practice would deter victims of sexual assault, which is widely underreported in the US, from coming forward. “If survivors believe their DNA may end up being used against them in the future, they’ll have one more reason not to participate in the rape kit process,” said California state senator Scott Wiener, who said he is working with Boudin’s office to pass legislation to prevent the practice if needed. It is unclear how many police departments use DNA databases of sexual assault victims to identify suspects. Boudin, who facing a recall effort, was elected to his position in 2019 alongside a national wave of progressive prosecutors seeking to reform the criminal justice system.

2/17/2022,"Prince Andrew is to remain a counsellor of state, able to step in temporarily for the Queen, along with retaining his title Duke of York and military rank of vice admiral after settling his US sexual abuse civil lawsuit, it is understood. There are no immediate plans to remove the titles, sources indicated, as calls for transparency over how the duke will fund the financial settlement with accuser Virginia Giuffre intensified along with those for him to relinquish his dukedom.  Andrew, 61, announced a “settlement in principle” with Giuffre, 38, on Tuesday in a joint statement which made no admission of liability over the allegations which he has always denied. The agreement left him facing widespread opprobium, with international lawyers speculating that he had had to settle the case because of the weakness of his legal position. Andrew was stripped of his royal patronages, honorary military titles and official use of his HRH style by the Queen last month in an attempt to distance the institution from the legal case. The Guardian understands Andrew’s decision to settle out-of-court for an undisclosed sum, reportedly as high as £12m, has not altered the situation in relation to the titles he still holds. Under legislation, he remains one of four counsellors of state who are required to step in should the sovereign be incapacitated through illness or absence abroad. The other three are Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry. Royal commentator Joe Little, of Majesty magazine, said: “This is a situation that needs resolving quickly. Recently, with William in Dubai, and Harry in the US, there was a distinct lack of counsellors of state. It needs to be resolved and ought to have been tackled before now.” It is also understood there are no plans to remove his Duke of York title, bestowed on him by the Queen when he got married, but which York Central Labour MP, Rachael Maskell, has claimed had been “a source of deep hurt and embarrassment to many people across the city”. He retains the title vice admiral because of his service in the Royal Navy. Plans to upgrade him to admiral on his 60th were delayed, and now appear shelved. Defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said “the decision on titles rests with the Palace”. Buckingham Palace has declined to comment on reports the Queen will be contributing to the financial settlement from her private income, derived from the Duchy of Lancaster estate. Shadow secretary of state for Scotland, Ian Murray, told the BBC that transparency was needed about how the settlement will be funded if public money will be involved. Royal finances expert David McClure said he felt strongly there was a “public right to know” about the “rough” size of the settlement, adding: “I don’t think this should be a state secret.” He believed £5m was a more likely figure. He expected Andrew would “more than likely probably have to turn to the Queen” for assistance in paying. In the joint statement on Tuesday, Andrew agreed to pay an undisclosed sum, as well as make a “substantial donation” to Giuffre’s charity for victims’ rights, and pledged to “demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein” by supporting the “fight against the evils of sex trafficking and by supporting its victims”. Labour MP Jess Phillips, shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, said it would be very difficult for Andrew to play a constructive role in fighting sex trafficking in future. “Those who work in sexual violence [and] human trafficking are certainly not going to have open arms to his allyship – even if it was just finances,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour. Andrew’s legal representative declined to comment on a Times report, that Giuffre will be able to speak publicly about her claim after the celebrations for the platinum jubilee are over. Gloria Allred, a US attorney who has represented a number of Epstein’s victims, said the joint statement confirming the settlement was “vague” and would have been “carefully negotiated”. She said Giuffre could testify in future court cases. “No settlement such as this one can ever require that an accuser remain silent in the criminal justice system. A prosecutor could decide to file criminal charges, in which case, Virginia could testify if called on”, she told BBC Breakfast.

2/17/2022,"Ukraine accused Russia on Wednesday of being behind a cyber-attack that targeted two banks and its defence ministry, which the country’s deputy prime minister said was the largest of its type ever seen. The Kremlin denied it was behind the denial of service attacks – attempts to overwhelm a website by flooding it with millions of requests – but the disruption reignited wider concerns of ongoing cyber-conflict.  Ilya Vityuk, cybersecurity chief of Ukraine’s SBU intelligence, said it was too early to definitively identify specific perpetrators, as is typically the case with cyber-attacks, where perpetrators make efforts to cover their tracks. But the official added: “The only country that is interested in such … attacks on our state, especially against the backdrop of massive panic about a possible military invasion, the only country that is interested is the Russian Federation.” Denying responsibility, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “We do not know anything. As expected, Ukraine continues blaming Russia for everything”. He added that Russia had had “nothing to do with” the denial of service attacks. Russia has been accused of being behind a string of cyber attacks against Ukraine since the 2014 war between the two countries, and some experts believe that if the Kremlin does de-escalate militarily, similar deniable attacks could follow. Danny Lopez, a former diplomat who runs cybersecurity firm Glasswall, said: “While we trying to find out if de-escalation is real, it’s in Russia’s interest to keep everybody guessing. Cyber attacks could now play an important role, to keep the pot warm on the stove but not spilling over into actual conflict”. Some of the incidents in the years following the war alarmed the west. Two brief regional power outages in December 2015 and 2016 were blamed on Russian hackers from the GRU military intelligence, according to a US indictment. The first affected 225,000 customers in the west of Ukraine. The second, affecting northern Kyiv, lasted about an hour, but amounted to the loss of about one-fifth of the capital’s power consumption. The same group, members of Unit 74455, according to the US Department of Justice, was also accused of being behind the NotPetya malware attack of June 2017. That initially targeted Ukraine’s financial, energy and government sectors but spread indiscriminately, causing billions in financial damage to Western and even Russian companies. Ciaran Martin, the former chief of the UK’s NCSC cyber agency, warned: “If Russia escalates against Ukraine, there’s the risk of another NotPetya style accident. After all, NotPetya, perhaps the most economically damaging cyber attack of all time, was the accidental fallout against the West of the Russians hacking Ukraine.” Such attacks may suggest what is possible in an all out conflict but Ukraine’s defences have been improving. Mindful of the risks, Kyiv signed a cybersecurity pact with the US in November. Help followed Tuesday’s attack, which disrupted banking services and, less seriously, knocked out the Ministry of Defence website. Other analysts, however, also believe that the attacks likely emanating from Russia have become more carefully calibrated to avoid international condemnation. Jamie McColl, a research fellow at the Rusi thinktank said: “Since NotPetya, the more disruptive ops have been more limited”. A recent example, of a more limited attack according to McColl, is the WhisperGate malware, which Microsoft detected in Ukraine in the middle of January. It was designed to look like ransomware, a virus that encrypts an organisation’s data, but without the unlock for payment mechanism that is a feature of such attacks. The political cost of such attacks is relatively low. Periodically Western intelligence agencies will accuse the Russian actors as being such hacking, but the Kremlin is resistant to embarrassment. The US also seeks to indict individuals but as Russia will not extradite them, there is no danger of any trials going ahead. Yet the goal of any cyber attacks need not be a dramatic effort to knock out a utility or banking system, it could simply be to wear out the morale of a country like Ukraine. Esther Naylor, a research analyst at Chatham House, said: “Attacks don’t have to do anything more destructive than a denial of service. Their goal is to cause panic, and to make people think what might come next”.",News/World news,Ukraine accuses Russia of cyber-attack on two banks and its defence ministry,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-cyber-attack-on-two-banks-and-its-defence-ministry
2/17/2022,"The US and the UK have sought to fend off a feared Russian invasion of Ukraine in part by going public with an unusual amount of intelligence, hoping to rob Vladimir Putin of the element of surprise. There have been regular briefings in Washington and London – sometimes from national security officials who do not often talk to the press – going into detail about potential Russian military tactics, regime change plots, and “false flag” operations Moscow is allegedly planning to provide a pretext for invasion.  Derek Chollet, the state department counselor, said on Wednesday that the US and its allies wanted to warn of Russia possibly carrying out such operations in Ukraine “in order to hinder their ability to do so”. “We are trying to be as forthcoming as possible, to say that’s their play and what could be coming,” Chollet said. In doing so, the US and UK are trying to beat Russia at what has largely been Moscow’s game in recent years – or at least to provide better opposition. “I think it’s the west getting a little more savvy on using intelligence in an actionable way,” John Sipher, a veteran of the CIA’s clandestine service, said. “It’s what we used to call – when the Russians did it – information warfare, and it’s something we’ve never got very good at. “What’s interesting is this information isn’t meant for Americans or British citizens. It’s meant for one consumer: Vladimir Putin,” Sipher said. “He’s the one who knows whether it’s true or not. So if we put out intelligence that the Russians thought was secret, and Putin knows it’s true, he’s got to decide how it has consequences for what he was trying to do, and how it’s affecting his strategy.” US and British officials have repeatedly said the ultimate decision to attack or not will be Putin’s alone, and even he may be leaving it to the last moment to make up his mind. If the decision is indeed on a knife-edge, the thinking goes, any small factor, such as taking away the surprise element and the satisfaction of catching the west off guard, could make a difference. “We’re in an information war with the Russians and we have been for some time,” Angela Stent, director of Georgetown University’s center for Eurasian, Russian and east European studies, said. “I think the Russians have been taken by surprise. I think they didn’t realise how much the US and Britain knew about this, but also that they would put it out there publicly. So I think it’s possible that this has had the impact of making Putin maybe rethink some things he might do.” Fiona Hill, a former senior director for European and Russian affairs in the national security council, and co-author of a Putin biography, contrasted this approach to the western response to past Russian operations, such as the attacks in Britain on the defectors Alexander Litvinenko and Sergei Skripal. “We never really kind of revealed what we knew about what they were up to, and then they were able as a result to take advantage of all the grey zones and the uncertainty and spin their own narratives,” Hill said. Going public also serves a domestic political purpose, especially for a US administration that has been widely criticised for failing to predict the collapse of the Afghan government and Taliban takeover last year. If there is a Russian attack, no one will be able to say the Biden White House was taken unawares. The flip side of that is if Putin does not attack, US and British intelligence will be accused of crying wolf and getting it wrong once more, especially as neither has shown evidence for their assertions. The Kremlin is already taunting the western media for reporting US and allied claims of imminent war. Another downside is that the deliberate alarmism is publicly alienating the government in Kyiv, which argues it is seeding panic among Ukrainian citizens and would-be foreign investors, insurers or trade partners. “This hysteria is now costing the country two to three billion dollars every month. We can’t borrow in foreign markets because the rates there are crazy. Many exporters refuse,” David Arakhamia, the head of the Ukrainian president’s Servant of the People party, told a local talk show, accusing western media of being more damaging than Russian propagandists. If Putin’s aim was not to carry out an invasion, with all the costs that would inflict on Russia, but to create an air of long-term crisis, then US and British amplification of the threat risks serving his purpose, argued Oksana Antonenko, a director of the global political risk team at the UK-based Control Risk consultancy. “The tactic only works if it’s a short term crisis,” Antonenko said. “But if we assume that what we’re facing at the moment is Putin’s long term strategy of applying pressure on Ukraine and managing confrontation with the west, then it is something which has a very high cost.”",News/World news, US and UK trying to fend off Russian invasion by making intelligence public,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/us-uk-russia-invasion-ingelligence-public-briefings
2/17/2022,"The veteran activist Sarah White, who has died aged 80, was for more than half a century a stalwart of initiatives dedicated to anti-colonialism, anti-racism and multiculturalism. Co-founder with John La Rose in 1966 of New Beacon Books, the UK’s first black bookshop and publishing company, where she worked until recent years, she was also a founder member of the International Book Fair of Radical Black and Third World Books in the early 1980s, and a trustee and secretary, from 1991 onwards, of the George Padmore Institute, a home for documents relating to the black presence in Britain. Born in Welwyn, Hertfordshire, Sarah grew up in a family steeped in politics and the arts. Her mother, Dorothy (known as Dodo, nee Swinburne), was politically active with the Liberal party in Hampstead, north London, where Sarah was raised, while her father, Eric Walter White, was the Arts Council’s first literature director, as well as being a translator, editor, poet and author.  Sarah attended Badminton school for girls in Bristol as a boarder in the 1950s, and went on to study the history of science and Russian at the University of Leeds (1959-62). Her political activism began as an undergraduate when she joined the Communist party of Great Britain, and she spent a year in Moscow (1963-64) on a course for teachers of Russian as a foreign language. Returning to London, she undertook a PhD at Imperial College London on the reception of Darwinism in Russia. During that time Sarah became involved with an anti-colonial exhibition and began doing voluntary work with the African National Congress, which had an office in Earl’s Court in London. Not far away was the West Indian Students’ Centre, where Sarah met John in the mid-60s. Together they built a partnership that, on a professional and personal level, lasted for more than four decades until John’s death in 2006. Sarah developed a close relationship with Michael and Keith, John’s sons from his marriage to Irma (nee Hilaire), and in 1966 Sarah and John started New Beacon Books in their flat in Hornsey Lane, near Crouch Hill in north London. The fledgling book service and shop took shape in the front rooms of premises where the couple variously lived, and Sarah would often use her moped to deliver items for sale at meetings and events. When she and John moved to their final residence, a whole room was completely shelved with books and made accessible to the public, at Albert Road in Finsbury Park. This was in 1968, shortly before the birth of their son, Wole, named after John’s friend, the Nigerian author and activist Wole Soyinka. In 1973 the bookshop found its current, dedicated home at 76 Stroud Green Road in Finsbury Park, close enough for Sarah to walk from home trundling a trolley-full of work. At the new headquarters, which also operated as an informal community hub, Sarah’s skills in production and proofreading were deployed to develop New Beacon’s publishing list, featuring titles by writers that included Wilson Harris, CLR James, Erna Brodber, Mervyn Morris and Ngugi wa Thiong’o. Using her training as a science historian, she also worked for many years on a part-time basis as the Soviet science consultant to New Scientist magazine, but by the mid-90s was focused almost entirely on the day-to-day running of the shop, with help from her fellow director Janice Durham and various volunteers. Sarah’s direct involvement continued until 2016, and although the shop was recently faced with closure, a successful crowdfunding venture appears to have guaranteed its future. Aside from New Beacon Books, Sarah was involved in a number of other related projects, including, in the late 60s, the Caribbean Artists Movement, set up by John with the poets Edward Kamau Brathwaite and Andrew Salkey to provide a platform for artists, intellectuals, writers and musicians to meet through events and conferences. In addition she lent her support to the Black Parents Movement, founded in 1975 to challenge police misbehaviour towards black youths. For the International Book Fair of Radical Black and Third World Books, collaboratively created by New Beacon, Bogle-L’Ouverture Publications and Race Today Publications in 1982, Sarah played a pivotal role behind the scenes – and particularly on its organising committee – until it was discontinued in 1995, being replaced by other associated ventures. With the 1991 establishment on the floors above the New Beacon bookshop of the George Padmore Institute – chaired by John, with input from others such as the academic Gus John, the poet Linton Kwesi Johnson and the psychiatrist Aggrey Burke – Sarah was closely connected with the development of archive collections held there to document the struggle of people of African, Caribbean and Asian descent in Britain. She served as trustee/secretary of the Institute until she fell ill in 2021. Down the years Sarah also co-edited several publications for the Institute and for New Beacon, including, with Roxy Harris and Sharmilla Beezmohun, A Meeting of the Continents (2005), documenting the history of the book fairs. Never one to foreground herself but valued for her selflessly committed contribution to racial equality, educational and social justice campaigns, Sarah had a sharp memory and intellect. Her cheery disposition was allied to great energy and a ready, distinctive laugh. She is survived by Wole.

2/17/2022,"South Africa have told the southern hemisphere’s governing body they are exploring their option of joining the Six Nations after 2025 as plans for a major overhaul of the global calendar gather pace. With powerbrokers of the global game due to meet next month to finalise plans for a ground-breaking biennial world competition, it has emerged that South Africa put Sanzaar on notice towards the end of last year.  The Springboks have been increasingly aligning themselves with the northern hemisphere in recent years with the Bulls, Sharks, Stormers and Lions all joining the United Rugby Championship. On Wednesday Sanzaar revealed how the South Africa union had committed to the Rugby Championship until 2025 – in line with broadcast arrangements. That signals a significant sea change, however, because less than 18 months ago, a similar commitment was made until 2030. Last month the Six Nations chief executive, Ben Morel, said he was “extremely cautious” about expansion but the financial benefits are obvious for all parties and South Africa are said to be in talks with the private equity firm CVC, which has acquired stakes in the Six Nations, the Premiership and the URC. “They [South Africa] did put us on notice they were exploring their options – that was well before Christmas,” said the Sanzaar chief executive, Brendan Morris. “We’ve got a number of international and local broadcast deals that are extended to 2025. There was never any cause for alarm that we were never going to meet those obligations. “We’re coming out of the worst three years in living memory of financial impact. Everybody has to do their due diligence in exploring what competitions to be involved in, and what provides the best opportunity for the best commercial outcome.” The Six Nations insisted its focus remains revamping the July and November Test windows with key talks to take place next month. Those discussions could result in a new-look world competition to be held every two years from 2024. The Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney, will be central to those discussions and though previous attempts to launch a World Nations Championship were consigned to failure in 2019 there is collective optimism that the biennial tournament – with a grand final in the November window – can get off the ground. The premise is largely similar to the World Nations Championship though it is being driven by the Six Nations unions and their Sanzaar counterparts. World Rugby is working closely with the unions and facilitating discussions but it is not taking the lead as was the case three years ago. According to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald, the competition would take place in non-World Cup and British & Irish Lions years and see the Six Nations and four Sanzaar teams joined by another two – potentially Japan and Fiji. All nations would accrue points throughout the Six Nations, Rugby Championship as well as the summer tours and November Tests. Rather than teams such as England touring one southern-hemisphere side in the summer, as Eddie Jones’s side do in Australia in July, however, they would tour multiple countries, as the Rugby Championship sides do in November. “If we can work together for an outcome that produces a global champion every two years, engages our fan bases more than we do now and throughout the year, and provides a pathway for rugby’s emerging nations to improve and progress, then we can be in a much better position to grow our game and take it to the next level,” the Sanzaar’s Morris told the Sydney Morning Herald. Some of the same stumbling blocks remain. The World Nations Championship effectively failed due to fears over introducing promotion and relegation to the Six Nations and again there is a push for the new competition to have two tiers and potential movement between them. Player welfare would also be an issue but the RFU is optimistic that there would be less resistance from the Premiership clubs than in the past given a more collaborative approach with PRL. The Premiership, meanwhile, is to drop asymptomatic Covid testing with immediate effect in line with the rest of the elite game in England. The current testing protocols for Jones’s England squad will remain in place, however, to stay aligned with the rest of the teams in the Six Nations.",Sport/Sport,South Africa open to joining Six Nations after 2025 amid calendar overhaul,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/16/south-africa-open-to-joining-six-nations-after-2025-amid-calendar-overhaul
2/17/2022,"France is expected to formally announce within days a phased withdrawal of its military forces in Mali after almost a decade, after months of diplomatic crisis between the two countries. The departure will mark an end to a fraught nine-year mission in Mali that French governments have argued is integral to regional security as well as prevent jihadist threats in Europe.  Yet over the course of the mission, popular support in the Sahel for the withdrawal of France’s Barkhane military force, alongside smaller deployments from other countries, has gradually grown and the planned scaling down of France’s 5,000 troop presence in the regions, about half of which is in Mali, had already been announced last year. Relations between France and Mali’s military leadersaiming for a reset in ties with the former colonial ruler have also suffered a bitter breakdown. France’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, on Monday signalled that a total withdrawal of troops from Mali was forthcoming. “If the conditions are no longer in place for us to be able to act in Mali, which is clearly the case, we will continue to fight terrorism side-by-side with Sahel countries who want it,” he said. The formal announcement is expected at a two-day EU and African Union summit in Brussels beginning on Thursday. A French withdrawal could trigger the further withdrawal of European military forces which make up the “Takuba taskforce”, according to documents seen by Reuters – suggesting France would “commence the coordinated withdrawal of their military resources from Malian territory.” A European diplomat also told the news agency it was “no longer a question of if they leave, but what happens with the troops, what happens to the UN peacekeeping force and what happens to the European Union missions.” Successive coups in Mali, first in 2020 when President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta was deposed, and again last year when the interim government was taken over, have upended historically close ties between successive Malian governments and France. The military regime of Colonel Assimi Goïta, who led both coups, has been subject to sanctions by regional west African leaders and the EU, drawing widespread criticisms for failing to agree a quick transition to democratic rule. The military rulers have said they plans to return power to a civilian government by 2026. The growing presence of Russian mercenary forces belonging to the Wagner Group have also fuelled tensions with France. In Mali, as well as Burkina Faso and Niger, popular resistance to the presence of French forces have led to significant anti-French protests, drawing several thousand in the Malian capital, Bamako. While France’s military has played a significant role in the counter-terrorism effort in the region, including training and supporting Malian forces, alleged abuses by French troops have sparked anger. An airstrike on Bounti Village by French forces killed 19 people and three armed men at a wedding, according to the UN and local community groups. Yet France have disputed the findings, insisting that it targeted terrorists. According to Nathaniel Powell, an analyst at Oxford Analytica, France’s military mission in the Sahel has had mixed results and its wider defence goals have suffered. “France’s overall security policy in the Sahel has been a massive failure and Barkhane is one the reasons for that. There have been tactical successes but [an] overall failure of foreign policy,” he said. Support for unpopular governments in Mali and the west African region, some of which have suffered military coups in recent years, have further undermined efforts to improve security and stability, he added, while French opposition to any negotiations between governments and the jihadist groups, has also fuelled popular upset at France. “Even if the negotiations don’t have a significant chance of success, it sent the message that France was an obstacle to resolving this and the sense that France is restricting governments from doing what they want to do.” Last year, President Emmanuel Macron reiterated that negotiations with terror groups, to end the crisis, would not be countenanced by France. “We cannot carry out joint operations with powers that decide to discuss with groups that, at the same time, shoot at our children. No dialogue and no compromise,” he said last June. Yet support for negotiations among some regional governments has persisted. A condition for negotiation by JNIM, a network of terrorist groups in the region has been the removal of foreign forces. The possible exit of French forces may provide a greater opportunity for negotiations to take place. Yet according to a diplomat in the region, France is not likely to immediately withdraw its forces from Mali, giving time for diplomatic tensions between the two countries to ease. “You might see a situation in a few months time, when things may have calmed down, that France feels it can slow down this withdrawal if things get better.”",News/World news,France poised to announce withdrawal of military forces from Mali ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/france-poised-to-announce-withdrawal-of-military-forces-from-mali
2/17/2022,"Scientists have modelled thousands of possible futures, and found that different social attitudes could make the difference between a temperature increase of just 1.8C or 3.6C by the end of the 21st century. Researchers dived into how the complex interactions between social factors, such as public opinion or adherence to the status quo, will affect the global heating trajectory by 2100 and found that there are five main possible outcomes. None of them meet the 1.5C Paris agreement target, but almost all achieve 0.5C less heating than the standard models, which don’t account for changes in social factors.  “This paper looks across a lot of different disciplines in order to try and document some of these relevant feedback processes,” said Frances Moore, assistant professor in environmental science at UC Davis, and lead author of this paper. “Because these social factors are not independent of each other. If they are connected together, that’s going to lead to different behaviour rather than if you just look at any one piece of the system independently.” These findings suggest scientists should start making projections which also account for climate policy and social change in their calculations, says Moore. But it is sometimes complicated for scientists to factor elements such as social and political response into their projections. Often each aspect is examined in disciplinary silos, and not as a complex web of interactions which can quickly stymie a change of directions. “You have a little bit of a change and then there are connections in the system, and they either amplify or dampen that change,” said Moore. “These can drive some complicated dynamics where you can get fairly sudden changes, like these kind of tipping-point-type changes, when it suddenly changes in ways that were not necessarily simple extrapolations of what you’ve seen before.” That’s why standard energy models often miss the mark and underpredict the rate at which renewable energy will grow in the future, for example. Moore and her team modelled 100,000 possible future global heating scenarios: in some models the researchers set institutions to have higher bias towards the status quo, or more responsiveness from the public, or decreasing costs of policy after policies are implemented, and so forth. Approximately 48% of the model runs paint a picture of what would happen if we continued on the path we’re on: global emissions would peak in the early 2030s, declining to zero by 2080, and temperatures in 2100 would have risen by 2.3C in comparison to pre-industrialisation temperatures between 1880 and 1910. Then, just over 5% of model runs represent “too little too late” or “delayed recognition” case scenarios, in which public opinion is too hard to change, political institutions are unresponsive, global emissions peak in 2050 and policies are delayed till after that – temperatures in 2100 are up to 3.6C higher than pre-industrialisation. In contrast, the “aggressive action” case scenarios, about 28% of model runs, results in a deep support for climate policy and plenty of emission-reduction technologies by the end of the 2020s, leading to zero global emissions by 2060. In 2100, Earth would be just 1.8C warmer than pre-industrialisation. Although there’s a lot of social science theory to back up these models, there’s still a very wide degree of freedom in the system. “Part of the problem is that there’s been very little attempt to actually put probabilities over these outcomes, because what typically happens in climate science is you kind of define an emissions trajectory, and you don’t really say how likely is that emissions trajectory over others,” said Moore. So although even the most aggressive action scenario fails to meet the Paris Agreement target to limit heating to 1.5C, there is a substantial probability of meeting the 2C Paris Agreement target. None of these models take into account the growing use of carbon-fixing technologies though, so projecting how those will grow into the future, and adding that to the models, might also help meet some more ambitious targets, Moore said. “It’s an important scientific question, to understand how society is embedded in this climate system and what these couple feedbacks between society and climate are,” Moore said. “But it’s also important for adaptation planning.”",News/Science,"How hot will the planet get?

2/17/2022,"Accusations of greenwashing against major oil companies that claim to be in transition to clean energy are well-founded, according to the most comprehensive study to date. The research, published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, examined the records of ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP, which together are responsible for more than 10% of global carbon emissions since 1965. The researchers analysed data over the 12 years up to 2020 and concluded the company claims do not align with their actions, which include increasing rather than decreasing exploration.  The study found a sharp rise in mentions of “climate”, “low-carbon” and “transition” in annual reports in recent years, especially for Shell and BP, and increasing pledges of action in strategies. But concrete actions were rare and the researchers said: “Financial analysis reveals a continuing business model dependence on fossil fuels along with insignificant and opaque spending on clean energy.” Numerous previous studies have shown there are already more reserves of oil and gas and more planned production than could be burned while keeping below the internationally agreed temperature target of 1.5C. In May 2021, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said there can be no new fossil fuel developments if the world is to reach net zero by 2050. Oil companies are under increasing pressure from investors to align their businesses with climate targets. But their plans have faced scepticism, prompting the researchers to conduct the new research, which they said was objective and comprehensive. “Until there is very concrete progress, we have every reason to be very sceptical about claims to be moving in a green direction,” said Prof Gregory Trencher, at Kyoto University in Japan, who worked with Mei Li and Jusen Asuka at Tohoku University. “If they were moving away from fossil fuels we would expect to see, for example, declines in exploration activity, fossil fuel production, and sales and profit from fossil fuels,” he said. “But if anything, we find evidence of the reverse happening.” “Recent pledges look very nice and they’re getting a lot of people excited, but we have to put these in the context of company history of actions,” Trencher said. “It’s like a very naughty schoolboy telling the teacher ‘I promise to do all my homework next week’, but the student has never worked hard.” The new study, published in the journal PLOS One, found mentions of climate-related keywords in annual reports rose sharply from 2009 to 2020. For example, BP’s use of “climate change” went from 22 to 326 mentions. But in terms of strategy and actions, the researchers found “the companies are pledging a transition to clean energy and setting targets more than they are making concrete actions”. Chevron and ExxonMobil were “laggards” compared to Shell and BP, the researchers said, but even the European majors’ actions appeared to contradict their pledges. For example, BP and Shell pledged to reduce investments in fossil fuel extraction projects, but both increased their acreage for new exploration in recent years, the researchers said. Furthermore, the analysis found Shell, BP, and Chevron increased fossil fuel production volumes over the study period. None of the companies directly releases data on their investments in clean energy, but information they provided to the Carbon Disclosure Project indicates low average levels ranging from 0.2% by ExxonMobil to 2.3% by BP of annual capital expenditure (capex). Separate analysis by the IEA indicates that investment in clean energy by oil and gas companies was about 1% of capex in 2020. “Until actions and investment behaviour are brought into alignment with discourse, accusations of greenwashing appear well-founded,” the researchers said. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said: “The move to a lower emission future requires multiple solutions that can be implemented at scale. We plan to play a leading role in the energy transition, while retaining investment flexibility across a portfolio of evolving opportunities, including for example carbon capture, hydrogen and biofuels, to maximise shareholder returns.” A Chevron spokesperson said: “We are focused on lowering the carbon intensity in our operations and seeking to grow lower carbon businesses along with our traditional business lines. We are planning $10bn in lower carbon investments by 2028.” Shell’s spokesperson said: “Shell’s target is to become a net zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. Our short, medium and long term intensity and absolute targets are consistent with the more ambitious 1.5C goal of the Paris Agreement. We were also the first energy company to submit its energy transition strategy to shareholders for a vote, securing strong endorsement.” A spokesperson for BP said: “In 2020 BP set out our new net zero ambition, aims and strategy, and in 2021 completed the largest transformation of the company in our history to deliver these. Because this paper looks back historically over the period 2009-2020, we don’t believe it will take these developments and our progress fully into account.” Trencher rejected the charge that the analysis was out of date: “We included the documents that were published during 2021, so the so-called data gap is only about six months and we don’t find any evidence of any new actions that would change any of our findings.” “Unfortunately, the way the energy markets are structured around the world, fossil fuels still enjoy many [regulatory and tax] advantages and renewables are still disadvantaged,” he said.",News/Environment,"Oil firms’ climate claims are greenwashing, study concludes",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/16/oil-firms-climate-claims-are-greenwashing-study-concludes
2/17/2022,"My friend and colleague Roy Collins, who has died aged 73, was one of the most gifted, and probably the most underrated, of the happy band of Fleet Street sports journalists who travelled the world in the last decades of the 20th century. Roy was chief sports writer of the start-up mid-market tabloid Today throughout its near-decade of existence (1986 to 1995). Today was a pioneer of new production methods but struggled for profile in a crowded market, so too few people appreciated his sharp eye, fluent and witty style and wide sporting knowledge.  Among his peers, though, Roy was considered very special: even in a profession full of characters he stood out as an instinctive contrarian and glorious madcap. In looks, build and character he had more than a touch of Basil Fawlty and his bar-room anecdotes of the latest outrage he had suffered tended to be detailed but always riveting. He was born in London, son of Charles, a typesetter, and Lilian, who died when he was 14. Roy’s schooldays were short but he gravitated into journalism and proved a natural. He trained on the Southend Evening Echo and left for a job that never materialised. Since Roy’s old post had been filled, the editor contacted a mate on the People, a Sunday paper with a massive sale in 1975, and recommended him. Starting with a downpage report on “a dreadful game” between Fulham and Blackpool, he moved rapidly up the pecking order before landing the starring role on Today. And though football was always his No 1 sport, he was a good judge of them all. Matthew Engel, as the Guardian man, sat next to Roy at the Mike Tyson-Buster Douglas fight in Tokyo in 1990, boxing’s biggest shock. Matthew recalled: “It was about round two and Roy said, ‘I reckon Douglas is winning.’ He picked that up much quicker than me and I suspect quicker than almost anyone.” When Today folded he went back to freelancing, which included seven years as the Guardian’s football feature writer. He brought with him the best skills of popular journalism including a well-filled contacts book (he ghosted George Best’s autobiography) and an unwillingness to take no for an answer. But he fitted perfectly into this paper’s more detached and stylish approach and might have made a fine successor to David Lacey as the No 1 correspondent. Instead he left in 2003 just as PR men became ubiquitous, making candid interviews with footballers near-impossible. Roy married Sheila Love in 1987 and she survives him, along with their daughter Lucy and granddaughter Eva. In 2010 Roy and Sheila moved to Spain. By then he had been diagnosed with leukaemia, which bedevilled his last years, but he remained on good form and still very much himself: surrounded by expats who were overwhelmingly Remainers, Roy voted Leave.

2/17/2022,"In the end there was nowhere left to hide, and there were no good options remaining. Since 2015, Prince Andrew has sought to discredit allegations of sexual abuse made against him by Virginia Giuffre, who claims that as a teenager she was repeatedly forced to sleep with him by the sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The prince has repeatedly denied this and, in a car-crash interview with BBC Newsnight, said he had no recollection of ever meeting her. As the screws tightened and Ms Giuffre filed a civil damages claim last year, his lawyers accused her of seeking a “payday”, questioned her mental health and tried to have the lawsuit thrown out on technical grounds. All in vain. But it was only when the Duke of York’s back was against the wall, and cross-examination under oath before a jury loomed, that he threw in the towel on Tuesday and settled. The amount to be paid by the prince remains undisclosed, but Ms Giuffre’s lawyers have previously suggested that it would need to be large enough to represent “a vindication” of her claim. The accompanying statement by both parties contains no admission of wrongdoing on Prince Andrew’s part, but the formerly dismissive prince recognises his accuser’s bravery in standing up for herself and her status as a victim of sexual abuse. He states that he never intended to malign her character. This was anything but a legal score-draw. The settlement represents a major victory for an abused young woman from a modest background. Ms Giuffre’s determination to hold the wealthy, powerful and connected to account for their actions has been spectacularly validated.  For Prince Andrew, on the other hand, it seems unlikely that this deal will deliver the kind of closure he must crave. Ms Giuffre’s lawsuit will not now cast a shadow over the Queen’s forthcoming platinum jubilee celebrations – a consideration which appears to have been a significant factor in the decision to settle. Future criminal charges are also rendered extremely unlikely. But the reputational damage to the monarch’s favourite son has been done. The damning verdict already delivered in the court of public opinion will only have been confirmed by Prince Andrew’s decision not to fight in an actual one. From the sustained nature of the friendship with Epstein – which continued even after a warrant was issued for his arrest over trafficking allegations – to the initial haughty indifference to Ms Giuffre’s claims, the prince’s behaviour has been that of a man who believed himself too powerful and too protected to be brought down. In that he was mistaken, and this misplaced, tin-eared hauteur contributed to his fall. The royal family has, in effect, cut him loose; the military titles and royal patronages have already gone and will not be restored. A campaign is under way to remove the title of Duke of York. Rightly, there is no comeback to public life in prospect. Prince Andrew’s future thus looks likely to play itself out in a purgatorial twilight, haunted by the grave allegations he chose not to refute in court. The terms of the settlement submitted to the New York judge, Lewis Kaplan, state that he will show his regret for his friendship with Epstein by supporting the fight against sex trafficking. But while the prince’s substantial donation to the charity set up by Ms Giuffre to support victims’ rights will be welcome, a more personal route to atonement is complicated by the fact that he has not admitted to any wrongdoing. The existential price of this settlement – more costly than the millions to be paid out to shut the case down – is a permanently stained reputation and a blocked path to public rehabilitation. It is a fate that Prince Andrew has brought upon himself.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Prince Andrew: closure with no prospect of redemption | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/16/the-guardian-view-on-prince-andrew-closure-with-no-prospect-of-redemption
2/17/2022,"“Stonehenge: built by immigrants,” reads a sign designed by the artist Jeremy Deller – a pithy reminder of an archaeological truth: that populations have been more mobile than is often convenient to believe in our modern age of borders and the nation state. Stonehenge was indeed built by “immigrants” – by the descendants of those who had crossed to Britain from continental Europe, bringing farming techniques with them, around 6,000 years ago. And from the medieval period, when mythographer Geoffrey of Monmouth claimed that it had been built by the wizard Merlin, to our own era of the druids, new age travellers and tourists who have worshipped, revelled and marvelled there, it has continued to accrue fresh new meanings and associations as each generation projects its own desires on to it. But one of the most intriguing points made by the curators of the new British Museum exhibition The World of Stonehenge is that the monument had a long and dynamic history of development and change before it began the second phase of its life as a ruin. The Wiltshire downlands around Stonehenge were, it seems, already special to the Mesolithic people who drove wooden stakes into the ground there before Doggerland, a territory that connected Britain to the continent, was subsumed into the North Sea around 8,500 years ago. Later, 5,000 years ago, the origins of Stonehenge itself were established when a mighty circular ditch and bank were built, with wooden posts or stones set just inside it. Not long afterwards, these were removed, and huge bluestones quarried in the Preseli Hills in Pembrokeshire were, remarkably, transported all the way to Wiltshire and set up there. Later still, around 4,500 years ago, came the erection of the giant sarsen stones.  These prehistoric time periods are hard to wrestle with; archaeology can show us only a flickering, evanescent glimpse of the lives of the peoples of the distant past. The British Museum’s exhibition covers a span of 12,000 to 3,000 years ago. To give some context to those dizzying aeons, it is worth remembering that earliest surviving texts about these islands come from only around 2,000 years ago, when classical writers such as Diodorus Siculus and Tacitus described Britain’s misty climate and the terrifying behaviour of its chilly, gelatinous, grey seas. What can we know about the people who built and used Stonehenge? Their stone circles often align with solstice sunsets or sunrises, so it is possible to infer that the sun was an important part of their cosmology. They valued beautiful things, and devoted time and skill to creating highly polished, elegantly shaped mace heads and axe heads – and, later, golden ornaments. Some of them travelled surprising distances – the “Amesbury archer”, who was buried nearby in around 2,300BC, had probably grown up in the Alps. But what of their desires, their passions, their beliefs? Mostly, they are irrecoverable. The generations of humans, as Homer wrote, are like leaves – they die away, forgotten, and are replaced. To consider the deep past is an exercise in wonder. It should also, perhaps, be one of humility.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Stonehenge: a dynamic monument | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/16/the-guardian-view-on-stonehenge-a-dynamic-monument
2/17/2022,"Police in Ottawa have warned they will begin breaking up blockades that have gridlocked traffic, angered residents and plunged Canada’s capital into a crisis that has rippled throughout the country.  For 20 days, protesters and large semi-trucks have blockaded sections of downtown Ottawa, including Parliament Hill, the seat of the country’s government. The protests, which began as a demonstration against public health measures including vaccine mandates, have morphed into a broader anti-government movement as more fringe elements, including far-right and nationalist groups, became a growing presence. On Wednesday, officers began handing out leaflets warning protesters to leave the area immediately or face the possible loss of their vehicle licenses. “You must leave the area now,” the leaflet read. “Anyone blocking streets, or assisting others in the blocking streets, are committing a criminal offence and you may be arrested.” The warnings by police were largely met with disdain: protesters tore up the leaflets or tossed them on the ground. On Monday, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, invoked legislation giving his government sweeping powers to end the “Freedom Convoy” protests. Ottawa’s deputy police chief, Steve Bell, said he believes the police now have the necessary reinforcements to bring the blockade to an end. But the police’s failure to prevent the protests in the beginning, and then to rid the city of the trucks over a three-week period, has baffled and angered residents of Ottawa and onlookers across Canada. Ottawa’s police chief, Peter Sloly, resigned on Tuesday as the force admitted they have little to show for the C$14m (US$11m)spent since the protests began. “I’ve watched in disbelief as this carnival of chaos has been allowed to continue,” said Diane Deans, chair of the Ottawa police services board, during a meeting on Tuesday. Despite local bylaws prohibiting the transport of fuel, protesters brazenly wheeled wagons and modified sleds full of diesel and propane past police – a day after the federal government invoked the Emergencies Act. The perceived apathy or impotence of the police when dealing with the convoy activists has also underscored what activists and academics say is a double standard in how officers respond towards Indigenous or Black-led protests. On Tuesday, video of Royal Canadian Mounted police embracing protesters at a dismantled blockade in southern Alberta laid bare the stark contrast. Only months before, the RCMP faced criticism for beating anti-logging protesters, ripping off their masks and using pepper spray on them. And in September, Toronto police violently disbanded protests supporting people living in a homeless encampment. Akwasi Owusu-Bempah, a sociology professor at the University of Toronto who specializes in policing and social inequality, said recent events show police are capable of using restraint during protests. “I know that that same level of restraint is not exercised at other times and with other populations,” he said. “There are some very clear differences between how a largely – although not wholly – white protest group is being policed here, and how, for example, Black and Indigenous people are policed when they’re exercising their right to peaceful protest,” he said. But while class and race may play a role in the recent lack of enforcement in Ottawa, Owusu-Bempah suspects that broader national security concerns could be playing a role in decision making. Officials have said they suspect that some Ottawa protesters have access to weapons, prompting a cautious approach over fears of escalation and violence. Earlier this week, police in Alberta seized a significant cache of weapons – including 13 long guns, handguns, body armour, a machete, a “large quantity” of ammunition, and high-capacity magazines – from a blockade near the border town of Coutts, Alberta, the same location where the video of the police embracing protesters was filmed. Four people were charged with the attempted murder of police officers. But Hayden King, head of an Indigenous-led policy thinktank, points out that Indigenous protests are rarely treated with a similar level of deference. “When it comes to Indigenous demonstrations, there does seem to be a disproportionate amount of force used. It’s not uncommon to see reconnaissance, and snipers on rooftops,” said King, executive director of the Yellowhead Institute and a member of Beausoleil First Nation. The protesters in Ottawa, as well as Coutts and those who blockaded the Ambassador Bridge last week, are overwhelmingly white. In instances where police believe Indigenous protesters could be armed, King says the response is often “overwhelmingly disproportionate” and includes the presence of assault rifles and dogs. He points to the 1995 Ipperwash Crisis, where police fatally shot Dudley George during a violent confrontation with Indigenous protesters. While Ottawa’s erstwhile chief had taken the job with hopes of reforming police and emphasizing the importance of de-escalation, King worries that the opposite outcome is more likely once the protests are inevitably broken up. “I imagine that police will use … this example as the justification for more funding, more militarization. And once that happens, after the tractor convoy leaves Ottawa or Toronto or wherever it is, police will be left with these resources. And they’ll use them against Indigenous people and against homeless encampments and Black activists,” he said. “The consequence of all this will be increased militarization of police, which will translate to even more disproportionate uses of force against Indigenous people.”",News/World news,‘Carnival of chaos’: Ottawa police face growing flak for failure to end protests,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/ottawa-protests-police-face-pressure-over-response
2/17/2022,"“No man is truly great who is great only in his lifetime. The test of greatness is the page of history” – William Hazlitt. For Pep Guardiola the question is: does he need to overcome a so-far fatal flaw of overthinking selection and win the Champions League for Manchester City in order to be ranked in the all-time managerial pantheon? Or does a CV that already includes two Champions League titles with Barcelona and three Premier League titles and a domestic treble for City make a nonsense of the debate?  This is the fascination as his team roll through another Champions League campaign which, if it ends in triumph, will surely finally silence his naysayers. City’s 5-0 obliteration of Sporting on Tuesday was the latest evidence of the ruthless winning machine Guardiola has built. He is assured of a place in the Premier League managers’ hall of fame, but the doubters put an asterisk next to the Barcelona Champions League wins because he was able to select Lionel Messi. The thinking is that if you take away arguably the best footballer of all time then Guardiola is a manager with a self-defeating inability to stop tinkering when it truly counts, a flaw that proved costly in May’s Champions League final defeat by Chelsea. Then, Guardiola’s XI became a collector’s item for not including his first-choice holding midfielder, Rodri, or Fernandinho. The exclusion of João Cancelo, his playmaking full-back, was a puzzle too. Another selection oddity came when he dropped his kingpin creative force Kevin De Bruyne for the Champions League quarter-final first leg at Tottenham in 2019. End result: no away goal – the method by which City were eliminated after a 4-4 aggregate draw. Has he learned from these selection faux pas? That is the question now that Guardiola’s team are a virtual shoo-in for a quarter-final berth after their rampant night in Lisbon. Afterwards at Estádio José Alvalade, Guardiola emphasised, as he likes to, that there can be no guarantees. But his squad are the Champions League favourites for a reason and no opponent will wish to be drawn against them. Just as clear is the bigger-picture stuff he points to when the question of him not having claimed the Champions League with City is put to him: that the fact his side are always “there” as contenders for the big prizes should be the true measure of his achievements for the club and (by inference) of his race as a manager. One way of assessing what Guardiola constructs at City is the length of his tenure. In the summer it will be six years since he replaced Manuel Pellegrini. A half-decade and more at any elite club in today’s boom-and-bust managerial merry-go-round is a relative aeon and casts Guardiola as a throwback to the all-powerful manager who serially accumulates silverware. The last of these was Arsène Wenger, who four years ago ended a 22-year tenure at Arsenal, his exit written up as the final sighting the phenomenon of the manager who sticks around long enough at a club to create his own, gilded era. Another example, of course, was Alex Ferguson, who started at Manchester United in 1986 and exited in 2013 after 13 titles and two Champions League victories. Guardiola insists he will not remain at City as long as Ferguson did across town. He may not need to because he seems intent on piling up trophies at dizzying speed. Whereas Ferguson needed seven years to claim his first league title at United, Guardiola took two. Guardiola, like Ferguson, successfully defended that first crown and his three titles have come in fewer seasons than United’s first under Ferguson. The latter, though, walked into a club in serious disarray and required time to bring it under his control, and he remains the manager par excellence: a one-off genius. Although Guardiola took over a team that had been champions only two years before, his relentless pursuit of excellence is certainly Fergusonian. The kind of performance they put in against Sporting, champions of Portugal, has become par for the course. But the bar set by Guardiola for his side should not be taken for granted. Under him City are occupying rarefied air but the stratosphere is yet to be reached. A team featuring the glittering talents of De Bruyne, Rodri, Cancelo, Phil Foden, Bernardo Silva, Kyle Walker, Rúben Dias and Ederson have to become champions of Europe to seal immortality. Lead them there and Guardiola will join them.

2/17/2022,"British authorities are worried that the current threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine may attract far-right extremists from the UK, who could travel to the country seeking weapons training and military experience. Counter-terrorism police were positioned at the departure gates of at least one main British airport this week, where they quizzed travellers flying to Ukraine about their identity and reasons for travel.  The checks came after at least half a dozen known neo-Nazis travelled to Ukraine from the US and a European country this week, security sources said. Last autumn, Kyiv deported two American men with links to neo-Nazi groups in their homeland, BuzzFeed reported. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said at the time that the men “tried to join one of the Ukrainian military units in order to gain combat experience, which the representatives of the group planned to use in illegal activities”. Western leaders have warned that Russia may be planning an invasion of Ukraine, after Moscow massed more than 130,000 troops – at least 60% of the country’s ground forces – along its borders. Western intelligence officials floated this week as a possible time to launch the attack, even as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged calm. In Kyiv and other cities, civilians have been buying weapons – legal with a permit in Ukraine – and taking first aid courses in preparation for violence potentially surging to their doorstep. But potential recruits to the far right would probably be looking to join paramilitary groups fighting on the frontline in the country’s eastern Donbas region. Russia has armed and funded an insurgency there since 2014, and though the conflict is largely frozen, exchanges of fire continue. US officials have warned that Russia could be preparing a “false flag” incident in the region which could be used as a pretext for a military intervention. In 2014, when Russian proxies attacked in the east, the Ukrainian government took all the help it could get, including from far-right extremists. Over time, these battalions were integrated with the country’s army and national guard. The most notorious far-right grouping is the Azov Battalion, a paramilitary force which uses Nazi-linked symbols and has had many members who have professed far-right extremist views. It was accused three years ago of actively seeking British recruits by Hope Not Hate, a leading anti-fascist watchdog. In recent years political and media concern about foreign recruitment of violent extremists has focused predominantly on Islamist radicals seeking to join groups such as Islamic State. However, far-right radicals also pose a serious threat to their home societies if they return with combat experience. The US is seeking the extradition of former US soldier Craig Lang from Ukraine to stand trial over the 2018 murder of a Florida couple, after he returned from time spent with far-right groups in eastern Ukraine. FBI director, Christopher Wray , warned in 2019 about increasing numbers of white supremacists seeking military experience abroad. “We are starting to see racially motivated violent extremists connecting with like-minded individuals online certainly, and in some instances, we have seen people travel overseas to train,” he told Congress. Canadian journalist Michael Colborne, who in January published a book on the far right in Ukraine, said if war did break out, battles could serve as both propaganda and training opportunity for the far right. “In the worst-case scenario Azov will get even more opportunities to present themselves as the ‘true defenders of the homeland and the avant garde of the revolution’. If it comes to capturing Ukrainian cities, I’m afraid we will see far-right guerrilla fighters in the streets,” he said in a recent interview with Marker, a website created by the Far-right Violence Monitoring Group. Asked about the counter-terrorism checks at airports, the Home Office said it did not comment on policing operations.",News/World news,Checks at UK airport over fears far-right extremists may travel to Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/checks-at-uk-airport-over-fears-far-right-extremists-may-travel-to-ukraine
