1/27/2022,"A Fox News panel reacted strongly to news of Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer's plans to retire. The focus quickly settled on President Biden's promise to nominate a Black woman. Host Harris Faulkner said ""what you're talking about is discrimination."" Minutes after news broke that Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer will be retiring, Harris Faulkner's show ""Outnumbered"" on Fox News quickly turned to outrage over President Joe Biden's campaign pledge to appoint a Black woman to the nation's highest court. Jonathan Turley, a Fox News contributor and constitutional law professor at George Washington University, compared Biden's pledge to college admissions and tried to argue picking a Black woman would be unconstitutional under any other circumstances. ""And the irony is the Supreme Court just accepted two cases on the use of race preferences in college admissions,"" Turley, who was a pro-Trump impeachment witness, said over the phone. ""And so this is obviously going to come up where the president's going to have to decide if he intends to fulfill a pledge that the court would never allow if he was actually admitting someone into a college."" Faulkner replied, ""Jonathan Turley, what you're talking about is discrimination."" ""And what we're about to see now is if the President of the United States would engage in that against a court who would say no to it otherwise, and that's an important thing,"" he continued. ""Race is at the heart of just about everything we see from the left right now. It is so much in the nomenclature of politics that are most divisive in America right now, not bringing us together. Would this further divide?"" Earlier in the show, Fox Nation streaming host Tomi Lahren said she hopes Biden has ""a better choice in mind"" than a Black woman. —Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) January 26, 2022 ""We saw how well that worked out with Kamala Harris, but here's to hoping he has a better choice in mind for this position,"" Lahren said. After asking if adding a Black woman to the bench — which would be a first in US history, with the only other woman of color to serve on the Supreme Court being Justice Sonya Sotomayor — could ""further divide"" the nation, Faulkner pivoted to speculation that Biden would nominate Vice President Kamala Harris. —Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) January 26, 2022 Fox News did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

1/27/2022,"BEIJING (AP) — China on Wednesday expressed “serious concerns and dissatisfaction” with the United States over reports of an internal State Department request to allow the departure of diplomats and their families from China amid tightening anti-pandemic measures. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said China’s anti-virus regulations were in line with international treaties governing the treatment of diplomatic personnel and that the nation was “undoubtedly the safest country in the world at the moment.” China has pursued a strict “zero tolerance” policy toward outbreaks, including lockdowns of millions of people, travel bans, compulsory masking, mass testing and health surveillance by smartphone apps. Classes, including those at international schools, have been moved online and travel links between Beijing and much of the rest of the country are suspended. The latest requirements call for testing of anyone purchasing cough, fever or cold medications. The measures are credited with preventing major outbreaks, although they have taken a significant toll on local economies and quality of life. “To leave such a safe place would only significantly increase the risk of infection for U.S. staff,” Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing. “We find the U.S. decision perplexing and unjustifiable.” It wasn’t clear if any embassy staff or their families had departed China in recent days, while Beijing enforced lockdowns on parts of the city ahead of the Feb. 4 opening of the Winter Olympics in the city and its outskirts. In an emailed statement, an unidentified State Department spokesperson said the “operating status at our mission in the PRC has not changed,” using the initials for the People’s Republic of China. “Any change in operating status of this nature would be predicated solely on the health, safety, and security of our colleagues and their family members,” the statement said. A drawdown of embassy personnel is something the U.S. would likely want to avoid ahead of or during the Winter Olympics. Staffing at the mission is being augmented to support American athletes, coaches and officials who are participating in the Games. However, COVID-19-related drawdowns have been common at U.S. embassies over the past two years as the pandemic has spread, and the State Department takes pains to stress that the health, security and well-being of its personnel and their families based overseas is of paramount concern. The ruling Communist Party newspaper Global Times portrayed the reported request to withdraw staff and dependents as a deliberate snub ahead of the Olympics. “Exclusive: Dirty trick again! U.S. plots to authorize departure of staff from embassies in China over epidemic ahead of Beijing Olympics,"" ran the paper's headline on its online edition. Human rights groups have called for a boycott of the Games over China's treatment of Uyghur Muslims and other minorities and the U.S. and key allies have announced they won't be sending dignitaries to attend in protest. China has brushed off the diplomatic boycott, and Zhao said China viewed the departure request as being politically motivated. “China has expressed serious concerns and dissatisfaction to the U.S. side in this regard, and we hope the U.S. will abide by and cooperate with our COVID rules, take China’s position and concerns seriously, and prudently consider the so-called authorized departure issue of its diplomatic and consular staff,"" Zhao said. Athletes and others participating in the Games are being completely isolated from the general public to try to avoid cross-infection. Thirteen people who have come for the Games tested positive on Tuesday, bringing the total to 106 among the 3,695 who have arrived. Two of the positive cases are either athletes or team officials. Those who test positive are taken to a hospital if they have symptoms and to a quarantine hotel if they do not. Beijing officials said Wednesday that eight people had tested positive in the 24-hour period ending at 4 p.m., bringing the total in the city’s delta variant outbreak to 69. Of those, 54 have symptoms and 15 do not. ___ AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee in Washington, D.C. contributed to this report.",World/Associated Press,China blasts US over reports of withdrawing diplomatic staff,https://news.yahoo.com/china-blasts-us-over-reports-134022960.html
1/27/2022,"Alexandra Daddario, 35, just had a major abs moment on Instagram. The former Baywatch star took to the social media platform to post two smokin' snaps that featured her incredible washboard abs and super sculpted core. And damn, she's looking hella fit! So how does she stay as strong as she is? Well, Alexandra is a hot yoga devotee. And she makes sure to slay it at the gym too. Former Baywatch star Alexandra Daddario is known for bringing it in the fitness department (have you seen her YouTube workout videos? OMG). But she just casually dropped a few pics in her Instagram Stories that show she’s still going hard at the gym. The photos are totally casual—they feature Alexandra showing off her tight abs and toned booty from the side, followed by a shot of the actress in comfy-looking sweats, lifting up her shirt slightly so you can see her abs. But there’s nothing casual about the way the 35-year-old approaches her workouts. Alexandra previously told Health that when she trained for her role as a lifeguard in Baywatch, she “was doing more aerobic activity and way more weight training, which is something I’ve [since] incorporated into my daily routine.” But, she said, the level she was going at was “not sustainable” unless you’re being paid to do it. These days, she spends a lot of time doing hot yoga. ""They teach mindfulness while getting a great workout,"" she says of her go-to studio, Modo Yoga. But she makes sure to get in gym time, too. Alexandra shared an intense-looking workout on YouTube with her trainer Patrick Murphy, that focused on doing as many reps as possible (a.k.a an AMRAP workout). And yeah, this is no joke. Alexandra focused on exercises that worked her upper body, legs, glutes, and abs, including lateral raises, reverse lunges, jump squats, push-ups, and stability ball crunches. She did 1o reps of each and worked through the circuit until 20 minutes had passed—whew! Alexandra did another YouTube fitness video alongside her Baywatch co-star Zac Efron and even beat him in a sit-up competition. So, yeah, Alexandra comes to play. Of course, Alexandra eats well, too. She told Health that her favorite meal is a mix of quinoa, avocado, and chicken breast. “When I’m hungry, I want food, like, now, or else I get very cranky,” she said, noting that it’s really easy to throw this meal together. Other go-tos, she told Delish, including having Sriracha bowls or salmon with broccoli and quinoa. But Alexandra also makes room in her eating plan for less healthy options. “As long as you’ve taken care of yourself in other ways, I think that it’s important to have balance,” she said.

1/27/2022,"WASHINGTON — The top public health authorities in the Biden administration denounced misinformation about the coronavirus vaccines following an anti-vaccine rally in Washington, D.C., over the weekend and a falsehood-laden segment on Fox News on Tuesday night that has been widely shared on social media. “You can’t walk away from the facts. And the facts are stunningly obvious,” Dr. Anthony Fauci said at a White House pandemic response team briefing in answer to a question about the Fox News segment, which had aired during Tucker Carlson’s nightly program the evening before and which the Washington Post promptly labeled as the anchor’s “most dishonest and dangerous pandemic segment yet.” Carlson is the most-watched news anchor in the nation, and he has used his program to discredit vaccines, masks and other measures related to the pandemic. That message appears to resonate with the conservatives who constitute his audience; Americans with right-leaning political views are less likely to take the pandemic seriously than are liberals. They are also less likely to be vaccinated. On Tuesday evening, Carlson’s guest was Alex Berenson, a former New York Times journalist who has become a crusader against vaccination. Berenson has been banned from Twitter for spreading untruths and has been branded “The Pandemic’s Wrongest Man” by the Atlantic magazine. Fox News, though, remains a safe space for his opinions, despite the fact that the network has a vaccine mandate in place for its employees. During his appearance, Berenson challenged the efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines, so called because they use a “messenger” molecule. The vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna both use mRNA biotechnology; they constitute the majority of doses administered in the United States, followed by the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which confers immunity through a different method. Other than being linked to a rare heart condition that afflicts younger men, the mRNA vaccines have been shown to be safe. But the novelty of those vaccines, along with partisan divisions around the pandemic and the rise of social media, has made it easy for Berenson and others to find a receptive audience for false vaccination claims. Speaking to Carlson, Berenson denounced the mRNA vaccines as a “dangerous and ineffective product,” arguing that they “don’t really work at all against Omicron.” Breakthrough infections against the Omicron variant have led to new questions about the efficacy of vaccines against new strains of the coronavirus. But most of those infections have come with either relatively mild symptoms or no symptoms at all if a person is vaccinated — and especially if they have had a booster shot. In short, vaccines protect their recipients from the most serious COVID-19 symptoms, saving many lives in the process. During the Fox News segment, Berenson added that the mRNA vaccines “need to be withdrawn from the market now. No one should get them. No one should get boosted.” Yahoo News reached out to Berenson, asking him to explain how he had arrived at those dramatic conclusions, which are not supported by most public health officials. It appeared that Fox News executives may have been skittish about Berenson’s appearance too. The following morning’s “Fox & Friends” saw an appearance by Dr. Marc Siegel, a frequent guest on the network’s programs. “Actually, the vaccines do work,” Siegel said. He also countered Berenson’s argument that high infection rates in Israel and other high-vaccination countries were evidence of the vaccines’ ineffectiveness. Public health officials have little recourse but to play whack-a-mole with the misinformation that routinely sweeps across the internet. Earlier this month, an improperly edited clip appeared to have Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, admitting that most people who died from COVID-19 had other serious conditions. She was, in fact, making an entirely different point, one about the efficacy of the vaccines, but by the time the correction was made by ABC, conservative social media sites had spent days touting the original clip as evidence that the coronavirus is not deadly unless one is already seriously sick with a chronic affliction like diabetes. As it stands, the unvaccinated are bearing the brunt of the Omicron surge, making the anti-vaccine messages they continue to absorb especially harmful. “Our hospitals are full of people who have not been vaccinated,” Walensky noted during Wednesday’s briefing, pointing out that a person who has received a booster shot is 68 times less likely to die from COVID-19 than is a person who has not been vaccinated at all. Still, millions had viewed Berenson’s appearance by Wednesday morning. It follows a Sunday rally in Washington, D.C., where vaccine skeptic and conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. compared the plight of the unvaccinated to that of Jews hounded by the Nazis during World War II. Kennedy’s book attacking Fauci and the biomedical establishment is among the top sellers on Amazon, suggesting just how deep the antipathy to vaccines has become.",U.S./Yahoo News,Fauci challenges Fox News vaccine falsehoods: 'The facts are stunningly obvious',https://news.yahoo.com/fauci-challenges-fox-news-vaccine-falsehoods-the-facts-are-stunningly-obvious-184653202.html
1/27/2022,"Norway's prime minister, whose country borders Russia and is a founding member of NATO, said Wednesday it's ""a sign of weakness"" that President Vladimir Putin has to express Moscow's political views by an ""extraordinary"" military buildup.

1/27/2022,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Norway’s prime minister, whose country borders Russia and is a founding member of NATO, said Wednesday he believes it’s “a sign of weakness” that President Vladimir Putin has to express Moscow’s political views by an “extraordinary” military buildup. Jonas Gahr Støre said in an interview with The Associated Press that he calls it a sign of weakness because it’s at the negotiating table where issues that matter to people should be discussed, not by “that kind of military demonstration,” and by pursuing Russia’s interests where “the weapons will speak.” He said he thinks Putin’s demand now for guarantees — including that NATO will never admit neighboring Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations as members — is a result of the loss of post-Cold War communications channels and dialogue that led to differences being settled through negotiations following after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014. “So there have been more kind of animosity and destructive relations among countries that need to engage,” Støre said. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied it is planning to invade neighboring Ukraine, but the U.S. and its NATO allies are worried about Russia deploying an estimated 100,000 troops near Ukraine and launching a series of sweeping military maneuvers. The Norwegian prime minister said his country sees this buildup with part of Russia’s Northern Fleet “sailing along our coast.” “Politically, for me, it is a sign of weakness in a way that you have to express your views and your interest by that kind of military demonstration, because it is at the table when you deal with the issues that matter to people,” Støre said. Russia warned Wednesday it would quickly take “retaliatory measures” if the U.S. and its allies reject its security demands, which also include that NATO will roll back troop deployments in other former Soviet bloc nations. Some demands, like pledging never to admit Ukraine, are nonstarters for NATO, creating a seemingly intractable stalemate that many fear can only end in a war. Asked what he thinks Putin’s “game plan” is, Støre replied, “he wants to leave us guessing.” The Norwegian prime minister stressed that Europe in the 21st century doesn’t solve political issues by a single nation, and the Russian guessing game indicates that “we should be firm, predictable and clear on principles.” While Ukraine is not a NATO member and therefore does not come under its collective defense umbrella, Støre said, “Europe and the West should be very clear that if there is infringement on the border of a modern state in Europe these days there will be reactions.” Europe and the West should be and are pursuing negotiations, he said, pointing to the U.S. and NATO dialogues with Russia . And there are “ample opportunities” to pursue confidence-building and disarmament measures and other procedures to provide security for countries living next to each other “without going down that terrible path of war,” Støre said. His country holds the U.N. Security Council presidency this month and he presided at its meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. While Norway is “a very loyal and active partner in NATO,” the prime minister said it has been at peace with neighboring Russia for 1,000 years and has a relationship with Moscow to maintain this peaceful relationship, which is a key priority of Norwegian foreign policy. There have been reports that Norway’s Nordic neighbors, Sweden and Finland, which are not NATO members, may be interested in joining the alliance. “Let that be their free choice,” Støre said. “Nobody else can come from outside and dictate their choice.” “I don’t see today that enlargement of NATO is on the agenda of NATO,” the Norwegian minister said, but it should treat the rising aspirations of democratic states “in a decent fashion.”",World/Associated Press,Norway's PM says Russia build-up is `a sign of weakness',https://news.yahoo.com/norways-pm-says-russia-build-182438728.html
1/27/2022,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday held interest rates at near zero, but reiterated its commitment to withdrawing its pandemic-era easy money policies in the face of rapid price increases. “With inflation well above 2% and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate,” the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in its updated statement. In its first policy-setting meeting of 2022, the Fed reiterated that U.S. economic activity continues to strengthen despite the emergence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. But a surge in prices since last year is weighing on the FOMC, where policymakers are coming around to the view that higher interest rates will be needed to prevent runaway inflation. Higher rates could address inflation by raising borrowing costs and dampening demand — particularly for goods. The Fed did not opt to raise interest rates Wednesday because policymakers have messaged that they want to end the central bank’s pandemic-era policy of asset purchases first. The FOMC reaffirmed Wednesday that it will wrap up that process in early March, meaning the first pandemic-era rate hike could be coming in six weeks. Looking ahead, the FOMC released a document detailing “principles” for how it may — down the line — actively shrink its asset holdings, noting that such a process would “commence after the process of increasing the target range for the federal funds rate has begun.” The statement suggests the Fed would allow maturing assets to roll off of its balance sheet, with a bias toward holding “primarily Treasury securities” (as opposed to the agency mortgage-backed securities it has also accumulated since the pandemic began). “The Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments,” the Fed statement reads. The decision to hold rates at near zero in Wednesday’s meeting was unanimously agreed upon by the FOMC’s voting members. The Fed has a dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment. On stable prices, the FOMC acknowledged that inflation remains elevated. The Consumer Price Index showed prices in the United States growing by 7.0% between December 2020 and December 2021, the fastest year-over-year pace of inflation seen since June 1982. Fed officials have been warning that elevated inflation readings could persist through the beginning of this year, increasing the pressure to tighten policy. In the last meeting in December, all 18 of the FOMC’s members saw the case for at least one rate increase (of 25 basis points) this year. Supporting the case for withdrawing its pandemic-era easy money policies: a labor market recovery that appears to be chugging along. In December, the unemployment rate tilted down to 3.9% — inching closer to the pre-pandemic rate of 3.5%. None of the FOMC members had expected the headline figure to be so low. “Job gains have been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially,” the FOMC statement reads. The Fed’s next policy-setting meeting is scheduled for March 15 and 16. Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance. You can follow him on Twitter @bcheungz.
