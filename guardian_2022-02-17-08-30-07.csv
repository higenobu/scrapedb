2/17/2022,"Jürgen Klopp insists Liverpool still have work to do in the second leg of their Champions League tie with Internazionale despite taking a significant step towards the quarter‑finals with victory at San Siro. They face a nervous wait, however, to discover the extent of an ankle injury sustained by Diogo Jota. The forward was withdrawn at half-time and replaced by Roberto Firmino, who went on to score the opener in Milan before Mohamed Salah added a second goal seven minutes from time to give Liverpool breathing space before the return leg at Anfield next month.  But Klopp said any talk of Liverpool facing a straightforward task to finish the job against Inter in the second leg is premature. “It’s still dangerous,” he said. “It’s half-time, nothing else. That’s how it is in the knockout stages. We don’t feel like we’re halfway through, it will be tricky and we have to be ready. It’s 2-0 at half-time. I wouldn’t tell the boys it was job done if it was 2-0 at half-time in any other game here, so I won’t think any different here.” Firmino’s and Salah’s second-half strikes gave Klopp’s side the advantage after a defensively resilient performance kept Simone Inzaghi’s side at bay. However, the one downside on the night was Jota’s injury, with Klopp confirming the Portuguese forward will be assessed in the coming days after being withdrawn at the break with an ankle problem. “I don’t know,” Klopp said when asked about the extent of the injury. “It was swollen which isn’t a good sign, but we have to see. We’ll check it as early as possible tomorrow but we’ll need further assessment.” Klopp also praised the impact of his substitutes, including Firmino and Jordan Henderson, as Liverpool seized control of the tie inside a raucous San Siro. “The boys who came on had a proper impact. Bobby scored and from there we controlled the game and scored a really nice second one. It was perfect how the boys reacted. It’s another performance I’m really happy with.”",Sport/Football,"‘It’s half-time, nothing else,’ Klopp says as Liverpool hold edge over Inter",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/16/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-internazionale-champions-league
2/17/2022,"The owner of Australia’s largest coal-fired power plant, the Eraring station on the shore of Lake Macquarie in New South Wales, has signalled it will close in 2025, seven years earlier than previously planned. Origin Energy has given the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) notice that will allow it to shut the 2,880MW black coal generator from August 2025. The company said its decision reflected “the rapidly changing conditions in the national electricity market, which are increasingly not well suited to traditional baseload power stations”.  It is the latest in a series of early coal plant closure announcements prompted by the rapid rise of cheaper renewable energy, which reached more than 30% of grid generation last year and is forecast to hit at least 69% by 2030. AGL last week announced it would bring forward the closure of the Bayswater generator in NSW from 2035 to no later than 2033, and its brown coal-fired Loy Yang A plant in Victoria from 2048 to 2045. EnergyAustralia’s Yallourn power plant, also in the Latrobe Valley, will shut in 2028 rather than 2032. Origin’s chief executive, Frank Calabria, said the energy market was now “very different” from when Eraring began fully operating in 1984. The plant provides about a fifth of NSW’s electricity generation. “The reality is the economics of coal-fired power stations are being put under increasing, unsustainable pressure by cleaner and lower cost generation, including solar, wind and batteries,” he said in a statement. “To enable Origin to support the market’s continued transition to renewables, we intend to utilise the Eraring site beyond any retirement of the coal-fired power station, with plans to install a large-scale battery.” Calabria said the company had consulted extensively with the NSW government to identify options, and believed “mechanisms are now in place” to guide future investment in supply to “more than compensate” for the Eraring’s closure. It would participate in NSW’s renewable electricity roadmap process – promised to support 12GW of clean energy and 2GW of storage – as it looked to install a battery with a capacity of up to 700MW at the site, he said. “We will continue to assess the market over time, and this will help inform any final decisions on the timing for closure of all four units [at Eraring],” he said. “We acknowledge this news will be challenging for many of our colleagues, suppliers and the local community. This is only the start of the process, and we commit to consulting with our people, and supporting them, through any potential closure.” Aemo last year released a draft “optimal development path” for the grid that suggested the country’s coal-fired power plants were likely to shut at almost triple the pace that was then expected. It expected a ninefold increase in large-scale wind and solar capacity and a trebling of the “firm” energy capacity that can be dispatched whenever required. Calabria said Origin had reserved $240m for the restoration and rehabilitation of the Eraring site, based on an expected closure date of 2032. That would continue to be reviewed, with the timing in part dependent on investment in a potential battery and an ash dam at the site.

2/17/2022,"Would a moratorium on new coal and gas projects – even one with almost no chance of actually happening – really cost Queensland $85bn and “shaft” New South Wales to the tune of $19bn? These were the eye-watering claims made in two stories in News Corp Australia mastheads in Brisbane and Sydney on the same day last week.  Those claims were amplified by the energy minister, Angus Taylor, and resources minister, Keith Pitt, in interviews and social media posts. Based on a wafer-thin premise that Labor would agree to a moratorium in a post-election power-sharing deal with the Greens (which the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has repeatedly rubbished), the stories also claimed more than 13,300 jobs were on the line in NSW while Queensland risked 53,000 jobs. The News Corp stories claimed exclusive access to Morrison government “analysis” to generate the headlines “Our $85bn black hole” and “A Green light to shaft us for $19bn”. So what’s going on here? The source for the “analysis” was the office of the resources minister, Keith Pitt, which told this column the numbers it provided to News Corp came from a December report on major resource and energy projects from the Office of the Chief Economist. That report comes with a spreadsheet that lists projects and the stage they’re at, and includes jobs and investment numbers provided by the companies behind the projects. Pitt’s office simply added up all the jobs and estimated capital costs for coal and gas projects for Queensland and NSW. And voilà. The news reports raised eyebrows among the energy experts at the Grattan Institute. They found that for the quoted jobs numbers in Queensland, even a ban on all new coal and gas projects would only have one-tenth of the impact on jobs being claimed by the minister and repeated by News Corp. The reason for this, the institute’s Alison Reeve told Temperature Check, was that just because a project was listed on paper as being possible, “it doesn’t mean it’s probable or likely”. “When you’re talking about jobs or investment that you’re forgoing, most of these jobs would never have happened anyway,” she said. The chief economist’s office assigns a development status to each project, from those that have only been announced publicly (but with no feasibility study carried out) to projects where the companies have made a decision to invest. Among the 69 coal projects listed in Queensland and NSW, 23 are at the very earliest stage. Only eight of the projects have been the subject of a final investment decision. When Reeve and colleagues looked at the projects in Queensland that were still uncommitted, they found 29 of 45 projects had been appearing on the same government list for at least five years without progressing. When they looked at the survival rate for projects listed in previous years, they found only half the gas projects mentioned in 2017 were either now committed or operating. For coal projects, just 6% had progressed. “If this trend is repeated over the next five years, just one in two Queensland gas projects and one in 16 Queensland coal projects would proceed,” Reeve and colleagues wrote. The Federal Government claims banning new coal and gas projects in Queensland would risk 53,000 jobs. Here’s why that’s a big exaggeration. @alison_reeve @tony_r_wood https://t.co/HDNk2Prtw8 The spreadsheet also lists the cost estimates for each project based on what the companies have said publicly. Some projects didn’t quote a single figure but instead a range – and this range in some cases stretched over $2.5bn. Pitt’s office said its “analysis” had picked the mid-range. So the same issue that renders the jobs figures unreliable applies to the billions in investment the News Corp stories, and Pitt and Taylor, claimed were at risk. Reeve said the longer-term issues of falling global demand for coal would present a problem for many communities, and “it doesn’t help them by telling them this is really scary and by putting out inflated numbers”. She added: “What’s going to have a much larger impact on Queensland coal jobs will be falling demand rather than jobs associated with projects that are not yet being built. Those are jobs that people actually have now that will disappear.” During a Senate hearing this week, the Greens senator Larissa Waters asked the executives at government-owned Snowy Hydro how much CO2 its planned Kurri Kurri gas plant will release for each unit of electricity it produces. Gordon Wymer, Snowy Hydro’s chief commercial officer, stepped up to the plate with a remarkable claim about the NSW project that’s being built with $600m of taxpayer money. People should not be fixated on the reported emissions intensity of the plant which, Wymer said, was 52kg of CO2-equivalent for every kilowatt hour (Wymer misspoke – the figure his company quotes equates to 520g for every kwh). “But that completely misses the big picture which is, if you’ll bear with me, that the plant will put out minus 3.9 [million tonnes] of CO2 per annum. There has been no focus on this and that’s a real shame,” Wymer said. Yet according to Snowy Hydro’s environmental report for the plant, Kurri Kurri will emit 500,000 tonnes of CO2 a year when it’s operating – emissions that will remain in the atmosphere for a century or more. Wymer attempted to argue the plant’s negative emissions qualities were because it would allow more wind and solar to be built, displacing coal. In short: gas plant pushes out dirtier coal and brings in renewables. But this is not how carbon accounting works. Dr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems expert at the University of Melbourne, said the argument was “obscure” and the 3.9m tonne figure was “impossible to work out” because it was based on assumptions and caveats. But he said: “Negative emissions implies a drawdown of carbon. This is absolutely not that.” We found out earlier this week the government’s Making Positive Energy marketing campaign – launched last September – will have cost taxpayers at least $31m by the time it’s scheduled to end in mid-April. This column has looked at some of the central claims made by the campaign, which spruiks the government’s record on emissions and promotes its technology-led plan to “reach net zero”. Since the campaign was launched, the government has released extracts of modelling that show how it thinks this plan will work. The government’s own modelling report showed that by 2050, the technology plan falls 226m tonnes of CO2-equivalent short of zero. Most of the shortfall is made up by buying international offsets, hoping future technologies will fill the gap and then relying on a controversial and unproven negative-emissions technology that’s not even featured in the government’s roadmap. And so, once more for those at the back, when the government says it has a plan to reach net zero, it doesn’t – whatever the $31m marketing campaign says.",News/Environment,How much would a coal and gas project moratorium really cost NSW and Queensland?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/17/how-much-would-a-coal-and-gas-project-moratorium-really-cost-nsw-and-queensland
2/17/2022,"Canada’s public safety minister has warned of ties between protesters occupying the country’s capital and a group of far-right extremists who were charged earlier this week in the border town of Coutts, Alberta, over an alleged plot to kill police officers. “Several of the individuals at Coutts have strong ties to a far-right extreme organization with leaders who are in Ottawa,” the minister, Marco Medicino, told reporters on Wednesday.  The arrests on Monday came as police cleared a blockade at the border – one of a string of such protests mounted in support of the so-called freedom convoy occupation of Ottawa. Police seized more than a dozen handguns and rifles, a cache of ammunition and body armour. Four of the arrested men are now accused of plotting to kill a number of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers and civilians. Medicino’s comments are likely to further stoke fears that extremist elements are present in a nationwide spate of unrest which began as a protest against Covid-19 health mandates but has embraced a broad range of anti-government grievances. The minister did not name the extremist group linked to the Coutts arrest, saying only “we are talking about a group that is organized, agile, knowledgeable and driven by an extremist ideology where might makes right.” But pictures after the arrests in Coutts show that some of the tactical equipment bore a flag with a white strip running diagonally across a black background. BREAKING: Gear seized by police at #Coutts includes a plate carrier with Diagolon patches. Diagolon is an accelerationist movement with members and chapters across Canada. Its de factor leader is Jeremy MacKenzie.1/pic.twitter.com/SPTrbXkOjh pic.twitter.com/z7J9ZdCjUk Extremist researchers Anti-Hate Canada said the symbol is the flag of a satirical country of Diagolon – and the emblem of a “neo-fascist” and militia movement of the same name. The group has not been linked to any violence, but the researchers say that a string of meetings where members have posed with firearms indicate that it is becoming “a militia network”. On the organization’s channel on the secure messaging app Telegram, members have in recent days cheered on the Coutts and Ottawa protests and shared images of prime minister Justin Trudeau’s head on a pyke. Anti-extremist researchers say that the group’s leader is a prominent far-right activist named Jeremy MacKenzie, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan who served in a Canadian Armed Forces infantry unit. Last April, he told viewers on a livestream: “Let’s just go to Parliament Hill and burn it down.” MacKenzie was arrested in late January on weapons charges in his home province in Nova Scotia and released awaiting trial. He lamented on his livestream that “all of my legally acquired and possessed firearms are now in the possession of the state.” Not long after his release in late January, MacKenzie headed to Ottawa, where scores of trucks and other vehicles have blockaded the centre of the city for weeks. There is no suggestion that Mackenzie is connected to the arrests in Coutts. After the Trudeau government invoked emergency powers in an effort to end the protest, MacKenzie hosted a livestream on Monday where he insisted: “Nobody’s going anywhere. You’re not scaring anybody. You want to fucking dance? Let’s dance.” “I was ready to die in Afghanistan for cause I didn’t even fucking believe in or care about. I care very much about this one,” he said. Peter Smith, a researcher with Anti-Hate Canada, said the introduction of new federal emergency powers has heightened the paranoia among the entire occupation. “What separates these extremist elements from others within the larger protest movement writ large is the emphasis on the inevitability or necessity of violence as a solution,” he said. Protesters and protest organizers in Ottawa have repeatedly disavowed violence and insisted that their protest is about peaceful civil disobedience. But police and emergency response sources in Ottawa say the authorities are concerned that some protestors in the city may possess firearms, and some elements of the movement appear to see the occupation as the possible trigger for broader unrest. “What we’re beginning to see emerge now are the hallmarks of a sophisticated and capable organization of a small number of individuals, but with a steel resolve, driven by an extreme ideology that would seek to create to overthrow the existing government,” Medicino said. The anti-vaccine group Hold Fast, which is present in Ottawa, posted to Facebook: “I smell civil war coming to Canada.” On Zello, the semi-official digital radio app of the occupiers, one prolific user commented: “I think we’ve got to lynch more than Trudeau. I think the peaceful protest is going to have to start changing.” The leader of Canada First, a far-right and antisemitic group that has been visible at the occupation, recently warned that “Trudeau cannot stop what is inevitable.”",News/World news,"Ottawa protests: ‘strong ties’ between some occupiers and far-right extremists, minister says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/ottawa-blockade-strong-ties-extremists
