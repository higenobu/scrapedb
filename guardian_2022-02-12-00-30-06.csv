2/12/2022,"Spain has announced it will loosen its border requirements, with children over 12 from non-EU countries no longer needing to be fully vaccinated. The Spanish government announced that it is relaxing its travel rules from Monday, which will be a boost for British holidaymakers planning to head abroad in February half-term.  Children aged 12 to 17 will now be able to visit by showing a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival in Spain, as an alternative to presenting a Covid certificate with proof of having been fully vaccinated. Reyes Maroto, Spain’s minister for trade, industry and tourism, said: “As one of the world’s favourite tourism destinations, we are committed to making travel to Spain a safe and easy experience for our visitors, especially for families travelling with children.” All other UK travellers, excluding children under 12, will still need to present a Covid certificate showing proof of being fully vaccinated at least 14 days prior to arrival in Spain. If more than 270 days have passed since the last dose was administered, proof of a booster jab is also required. Prior to travelling to Spain, all passengers must also present a QR code which is obtained from filling in the Health Control Form (FCS in Spanish) available via Spain Travel Health (SpTH). Tourism bodies welcomed the move, with a spokesperson for ABTA, the British Travel Association, saying the changes to the rules will mean more families will be able to enjoy a break in one of the UK’s most popular overseas holiday destinations. “This, along with the UK also relaxing its travel requirements, means it is getting easier for people to set off on their long-awaited holidays abroad. “With two-thirds of families saying their holidays are more important to them now than before the pandemic, the latest changes should give more people confidence to book their much-missed foreign holiday,” the spokesperson added.",Lifestyle/Travel,Spain to drop Covid vaccine requirement for UK teenagers,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/feb/11/spain-to-drop-covid-vaccine-requirement-for-uk-teenagers
2/12/2022,"Cressida Dick absolutely despised Line of Duty. The endlessly promoted Metropolitan police chief really crossed the road to tip on the BBC smash hit – so tellingly incensed by a show about sidelined cops doing the painful and unpopular work of rooting out bad apples. As Dame Cressida finally resigns from the spoilt barrel of the Met, I couldn’t help but recall a 2019 Radio Times interview in which she expanded on her issues. “I was absolutely outraged by the level of casual and extreme corruption that was being portrayed as the way the police is,” Dick told the magazine. “It’s so far from that. The standards and professionalism are so high.” Mmm. It was left to the show’s creator, Jed Mercurio, to offer a little background. “My inspiration for creating Line of Duty was @metpoliceuk shooting an innocent man and their dishonesty in the aftermath,” he explained icily, “so thanks to Cressida Dick for reminding me of our connection.” Dick, of course, ran the bungled counterterrorism operation that resulted in Met officers fatally shooting Jean Charles de Menezes, an entirely innocent 27-year-old electrician.  But oddly – indeed, bizarrely – that wasn’t the only Mercurio creation the Met chief had issues with. Both in the Radio Times interview and in an earlier outing on GMB, she added that she’d had to switch off the BBC’s Bodyguard – at the time, the most watched drama since current records began – because she couldn’t handle the mere idea of the two protagonists beginning a sexual relationship. As she put it: “The moment when the home secretary made a pass at the protection officer was just beyond me, I’m afraid.” And yet, beyond her how? Beyond her why? In recent memory, a police protection officer had been dismissed for allegedly having an affair with the wife of the then home secretary, Alan Johnson. At the time, the special operations directorate to which he reported was being run by one Cressida Dick. Forgive me for beginning by focusing on Dick’s outrage about entirely fictional events, when she appeared to experience only mild displeasure at so many hideously real situations involving her officers. But Dame Cressida’s telly critiques unwittingly revealed her most deadly flaws: a total failure of imagination, even in the face of overwhelming evidence, and a total loyalty to officers that superseded all else. The public came a very distant second, and increasingly knew it. As for the historic moment in which we currently find ourselves, you can be sure some future screenwriter will one day consider it more than ripe for dramatisation. Consider where we lay our scene. The under-fire Met police are – reluctantly and belatedly – investigating multiple alleged criminal breaches of the law by the denizens of Number 10 Downing Street, the very people who made those laws. That should be mindblowing enough, and certainly is for the majority of ordinary British people, who have spent many weeks now feeling deeply furious and unforgivably mugged off by their overlords, while they were living under the most draconian restrictions imposed in peacetime. But there is more. There really are Conservative MPs who have spent a lot of those past few weeks explaining, on the record, that members of the government breaking their own laws isn’t that big a deal. Mindblowing again – and yet there is even more. Off the record, some Conservatives are now saying that should the prime minister be found to have breached the law and be served with fines or multiple fines … well, that isn’t too big a deal either, and he could certainly carry on being prime minister afterwards. Still want more? You’re in luck! This morning, a senior ally of Boris Johnson warned that the Met would have to be “very certain” before it dared issue a fine to the PM for breaking lockdown law. “Do you want the Metropolitan police deciding who the prime minister is?” was the way this individual chose to characterise the mere idea of the Met doing their job without fear or favour. “They have to be very certain [before issuing a fine]. If he does get one, it would be odd if the discretionary action of the police determines the future of the country.” Would it? Would it not be more “odd” that the actual prime minister had allegedly repeatedly breached his own laws? Indeed, you might think it rather more “odd” that this was how very senior figures now characterised one of the most basic principles – applying the rule of law. Meanwhile, you’ll be aware there is even more. Also this morning, the home secretary, Priti Patel, denounced the mayor of London’s decision to effectively force Cressida Dick’s resignation as “rude and unprofessional”. Rude and unprofessional – both those words feel like high praise from someone who was found by a formal investigation to have repeatedly bullied her own officials, but who refused to do the honourable thing and resign. The only person to resign in despair was the prime minister’s adviser on standards. Patel herself was protected by the same prime minister currently under investigation himself, in his case by the police. There’s more – always more – but the above is a fairly stark summary of the state we’re in. If the BBC did ever commission a drama about the symbiosis between a fictional corrupt police force and a fictional corrupt government, it would probably be another huge hit. The national broadcaster makes pretty great television that is admired around the world – not that you’d know it from anything ever said by the government, which is itself not admired around the world. Yes, rest assured someone like Nadine Dorries would be straight out of the traps to dump on the corporation for disloyalty or bias or creating something more popular than her. And no doubt Nadine would be ably assisted by whoever Priti Patel appoints to replace Cressida Dick. It’s called sticking together, isn’t it? In the end, low calibre and underperforming politicians seem to like low calibre and underperforming public officials. Everyone gets something out of it, with the sole exception of the entire British public. Yet there is something not just deeply depressing but increasingly dangerous about ordinary people thinking: “If I behaved like the prime minister or those police officers, I’d be sacked.” Trust is the very hardest thing to get back, and trust in the police and in politicians is demonstrably nosediving. Both have only themselves to blame. If there’s some great moral difference between police officers making rape and domestic violence jokes, and politicians claiming it doesn’t matter at all if the prime minister breaks the law, then I’d love to hear it. But there isn’t. However much some Conservatives and some Met officers may strain against it, this shameful moment in both their histories should be an inflection point.

2/12/2022,"Windsor and Maidenhead council has ditched a plan to abolish arts funding following an outcry from residents and objections from the former prime minister Theresa May, the local MP. Instead of cutting funds to an arts centre and theatre to zero – a move that both organisations said would threaten their existence – the council has agreed a 17% increase in the next financial year.  The comedians Russell Brand, Mark Watson, Rachel Parris, Stephen K Amos and Alfie Moore also supported the campaign against the funding cut. May said: “It is extremely welcome that the [council has] listened to the strength of local feeling … The arts play such an important role nationwide, helping to enrich our communities and expand our intellectual horizons.” The Norden Farm Centre for the Arts in Maidenhead and the Old Court theatre in Windsor are now set to receive £140,000 in the next financial year. A consultation launched by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead (RBWM) on its budget proposals resulted in 1,800 submissions from residents, community groups and businesses. “Investing in arts and culture was identified clearly as one of people’s key budget priorities,” a council statement said. Andrew Johnson, the council leader, said: “Taking on board the community’s strength of feeling around arts funding … we amended the proposed budget.” Spending by English councils on cultural services has fallen from £118.93 per person in 2009-10 to £59.90 in 2020-21 – a cut of 50%. Councils are in the process of setting budgets for 2022-23 amid concern about the impact of further cuts in a sector that was badly hit by the Covid pandemic. Councils in England help fund a range of local cultural organisations, including 3,000 libraries, 350 museums, 116 theatres plus castles, amusement parks, monuments, historic buildings and heritage sites. ​​Jack Gamble, the director of the Public Campaign for the Arts, which organised opposition to the proposed cuts in Windsor and Maidenhead, said: “This remarkable turnaround is the result of people joining together to champion the value of art and culture in our lives and communities.” Norden Farm, which has a 220-seat theatre and organises a range of community activities, said continued council funding was essential to keep the centre open. It had already taken steps to reduce costs and increase income. Jane Corry, the centre’s artistic director and chief executive, said: “We could not be more delighted about the decision last night from RBWM … We are so very grateful to our amazing supporters for showing such love and determination to get sustained arts funding returned, and to the council for showing how much they value the arts.”",Arts/Culture,Theresa May’s local council drops plan to abolish arts funding,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/11/theresa-may-council-drops-plan-abolish-arts-funding-windsor-maidenhead
2/12/2022,"This time Ayumu Hirano would not be denied. Not by the judges. Not even by the greatest snowboarder in history. Instead, amid the most intense pressure and anger, the 23-year-old from Japan found the halfpipe equivalent of the holy grail. And as Hirano stood on the podium with his gold medal there was a sense of something else too. That a torch was being passed from one generation to the next, as if by osmosis, from Shaun White to Hirano: from the goat to the new breed of bucks pushing at the boundaries like the American once did.  Without White, the Olympics might not have Hirano, or Chloe Kim, or Eileen Gu. The now 35-year-old finished his competitive career here, without a medal but with his legacy sitting above him in the medal table. The one-time teenage phenom known as the Flying Tomato who brought the cool of the X Games to the Olympic arena and dragged the rest with him, finished fourth in his fifth Olympics. White, the defending champion who won three Olympic titles going back to 2006 among those five appearances, called it the run of Hirano’s young life. It was that and more. The triple cork 1440 is so fiendishly difficult that, until Friday morning here in Beijing, no one had ever attempted and gone on to finish their run. White had tried in training, in 2013, and it hospitalised him. Yet from the moment Hirano slid down the pipe and soared 5.5 metres in the air it was on. Over the next second or so, the Japanese rider then became a human gyroscope, spinning four full rotations while simultaneously inverting three times. More tricks followed and long before the judges conferred, and awarded him a score of 96.00, victory was his. “It hasn’t sunk in yet but finally one of my childhood dreams has come true,” he said. “It wasn’t nervousness, but I had a different feeling from usual. I was ready to take the plunge and give it my all, and it was great to finish it off cleanly.” It was some effort because at that point Hirano was in a controversial second place behind Scotty James. Wearing the red boxing gloves that have become his trademark, the Australian unleashed two double cork 1440s on his second run to score 92.50 and move into the lead. It was James who had promised it would take something epic to win an Olympic gold medal. And Hirano immediately responded with exactly that: a huge run that looked to raise the bar but was only given 91.75 by the judges. The hashtag #robbed was soon trending on Twitter, but while Hirano admitted he was angry he was able to channel it to win gold. As for White, he can be proud of his performance despite missing out on a medal. His best run, his second, included a front-side double cork 1440 and his signature double McTwist 1260. But he knew he needed more, and so he upped the ante in his final attempt by attempting the double cork 1440 combo that won him gold in Pyeongchang. Yet his body couldn’t quite deliver and he was unable to stick a landing. “I wish I could have landed my last run, but I was having some difficulty in my back leg for some reason,” he explained. “It was giving out on every run, I don’t know why. “Maybe it was the pressure, maybe it was just exhaustion. It was really challenging, but that’s OK, that’s it, I’m done.” Then, as it all began to sink in, White began to cry. “Sorry you’re going to get me ugly crying here, but I’m not upset about the result,” he said. “I would have loved to put it down. I made it happen for two runs and I couldn’t hold on for the last. It’s hard for me not to get hung up on that last run, I wanted it so badly. But you can’t always get what you want, you get what you need.” If there was any comfort from leaving empty handed in the final competition of his career, it came from the hugs and acknowledgements from his fellow competitors, who attempted to put into words White’s influence over the past two decades. “Like everyone else who was riding today, I look up to him as a huge idol,” said James. “When I was 15, he was just so much better than everyone else, and I feel he was probably the most dominant snowboard character in competition ever. He looks back on 20 years of riding at the highest level, and it was a huge pleasure to have him today in this competition.” As White heard the tributes he smiled. A new career awaits, and while he is not sure what he will do next, he won’t be short of offers either. “It’s been a journey, I’m just so happy, and thank you all from the bottom of my heart,” he said. “A lot of emotions are hitting me right now, the cheering from the crowd, some kind words from my fellow competitors at the bottom, I’m so happy.” “Snowboarding, thank you. It’s been the love of my life.”",Sport/Sport,Farewell to the Flying Tomato: how Shaun White left an Olympic legacy,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/11/farewell-to-the-flying-tomato-how-snowboarder-shaun-white-left-an-olympic-legacy
2/12/2022,"If you’ve considered paring back your social media use, you are not alone. A 2020 survey found that nearly half of adults in the UK were thinking of quitting Facebook. But to truly disappear online is harder. I asked Alicia Mendonça-Richards, a solicitor with expertise in online reputation management, if we can ever delete ourselves completely. I told my mum I wanted to delete my accounts and she said, “What have you done?” It’s not true that only the crooked may need to disappear, right?Right – you could just be somebody who doesn’t want all their personal information online. But there are also examples where there’s false or very private information online, such as with revenge porn.  And that is on the up. I worry that, if police are overwhelmed and it’s too expensive to hire lawyers, revenge porn will become the new normal.I wouldn’t say you always need a lawyer. Many porn sites have a simple process to take down non-consensual content. And there’s a national revenge porn helpline. But would it be possible to disappear completely?It would be difficult unless you’ve been extremely careful – no social media, no use of online public records such as the electoral register. What about cookies and advertising data? They used that to track someone down in the Netflix drama Clickbait.That’s different. Many apps sell personal data but, in the UK, it’s usually anonymised. It may be hard to delete yourself completely, but if there is private, false or out-of-date information about you out there, there’ll be a legal avenue for removal. Note to self: Netflix is not real life. You’re talking about the right to be forgotten: legislation that gives people the right to ask search engines to remove content about them. I often see “some links have been removed” at the end of Google results and wonder who had what removed.Actually, that’s just something Google puts at the bottom of all search results. I see! Can you give me an example of when Google might say no?There was a case in 2018 where two people sued Google for failing to remove information about their spent criminal convictions. Google argued people had a right to know. The judge disagreed for one of the claimants, because their conviction was no longer relevant to their life. Different from Axl Rose’s 2016 case to stop Google listing a fat picture of him. Maybe that’s why high-profile people aren’t doing it more?The US doesn’t have an equivalent law. There was a case where it was decided that Google did not have to block global search results, so something removed from Google UK could be found on Google.com. Ultimately, the best thing to do is be careful online. If you are not sure what’s out there, there are companies that can map your entire online presence for you. I just had a full-body cringe imagining all my terrible old haircuts …Well, you could probably argue that the information is outdated, and attempt to get it removed under the right to be forgotten. They should be forgotten! I have served my sentence for crimes against fashion. One last thing – if someone did ask Google to forget them, it’s a human being dealing with it, right?

2/12/2022,"Ralf Rangnick is clear a lack of goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Manchester United’s other forwards in recent games has cost the team victory. United have managed a single strike in each of their past three matches, drawing two – 1-1 against Middlesbrough, who beat them on penalties, and Burnley – and winning one, 1-0 against West Ham. There have been 14 United goals in Rangnick’s 11 matches as interim manager.  Ronaldo, the top scorer with 14, has not registered for five games. Rangnick was asked whether he knew how to best use the Portuguese for the benefit of the team. “It’s not only about Cristiano Ronaldo,” he said. “That we should score more goals, it’s obvious. We created enough chances in the last couple of games but we just didn’t score enough goals. This is not only an issue with Cristiano – it’s an issue with other players, especially with the offensive players: we don’t score enough goals. “If you bear in mind how many chances we create, it needs to get better in the coming weeks. In the first half against Burnley, we were very close to the gameplan we spoke about before the game. Now it’s about rewarding ourselves with the results we deserve.” Rangnick is also concerned regarding how his side react when the opposition score. “We conceded against Middlesbrough after [about] 60 minutes and Burnley 50; then, we should stick to the gameplan, not lose shape, composure – this was the most harmful part. “We didn’t have the same positioning on the pitch and this is what we spoke about when we analysed the Burnley game. If the other team scores a goal we have to be aware of why we were so dominant and not lose structure, lose shape. This was obviously what occurred fo 15, 20 minutes versus Burnley. It got better at the end but in those minutes we lost that shape.” Rangnick defended Harry Maguire, who has been criticised for recent displays. “I think he had an outstanding game against West Ham – like all the rest of our backline,” he said. “Against Middlesbrough, we didn’t give that many chances away and against Burnley we could have defended that transitional moment better [for their goal] but it was a negative chain reaction like most teams concede – we shouldn’t have allowed him [the goalscorer Jay Rodriguez] to go through.”",Sport/Football,Rangnick tells Ronaldo and Manchester United’s other forwards to score more,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/11/ralf-rangnick-tells-cristiano-ronaldo-manchester-united-forwards-to-score-more
2/12/2022,"Earlier this week the Winter Olympic skating finals dished up one the most heartbreaking things you’ll ever see in sport. Zhu Yi is a 19-year-old Chinese figure skater. She was born and raised in California, and called Beverley Zu until she switched allegiance to her parents’ homeland four years ago. The day before Zhu had skated in the women’s short programme team event. It was a disaster.  She’d fallen on her first jump, crashed into a wall, and finished 10th in a field of 10. True to a discipline that is always poised on the edge of some horribly poignant collapse, she’d done all of this to the sounds of Mick Jagger singing about flowers, girls dressed in their summer clothes and a cloud of toxic black despair consuming all human hope. Zhu had been inconsolable afterwards. She was duly scorned and ridiculed overnight on Chinese mainstream and social media (“Zhu Yi has Fallen” was trending on Weibo), with some casting her selection ahead of an “authentic” Chinese skater as an affront. And Zhu looked horribly bruised and fragile at the start of Monday’s free skate, as she paused, took a breath, tiny in all that cold hard space, and immediately fell over again. Then she fell over again, landing splayed on her knee. At which point, with the day melting around her, she just had to carry on, this slight, tearful human in hopeful red weeds weeping along to her own routine as Sunset Boulevard soared and trilled. There were levels to this horribly tender theatre of pain. Towards the end something else began to happen. Zhu began to express her sorrow through her movements, horror seeping in to that perky choreography, because for all its craft this is a discipline the athletes feel. There were melancholic turns and heartbreaking shimmies. She ended with a series of sweeps, all stricken grace, then just kind of collapsed, gloved hands raised to her face. It felt as though three kinds of cruelty had collided here: the basic cruelty of elite sport; the cruelty of our shared digital world; and above all that hard, deathly quality that lurks behind these industrialised propaganda circuses. And yet in the middle of all this there was still that unplanned element of beauty, the spectacle of Zhu Yi painting it black. This was supposed to be the most heartbreaking story of the week in figure skating. It remained that way until Thursday morning. At which point another competitor, Kamila Valieva, found herself on the wrong end of the machine in a way that could provide its own deeply troubling tagline to these Olympics. It has now been confirmed that the delay to Tuesday’s team event medal ceremony was due to a failed drug test; and that the athlete concerned was Valieva, part of the Russian Olympic Committee’s brilliant gold medal-winning team. Valieva is 15 years old. She may already be, according to those who know this sport intimately, the greatest figure skater of all time. The initial finding is she tested positive before the Games for a banned drug used to treat coronary artery disease. The court of arbitration for sport will convene at Wada’s request after Russia’s anti-doping committee lifted a provisional ban. No medical reason for the finding, nor any medical exemption have yet been offered. There is no shortage of precedent for sweepings-under-the-carpet in such cases, some a lot closer to home. But should the positive test be confirmed (as a doping violation) the gold will go to the US, so no hard feelings there. And it is a mind-boggling story on so many levels, Ben Johnson on ice with a helping of neo-Cold War politics. A confirmed drug scandal of this scale would put a fist right through China’s Games, and do so at a time when the spectacle has basically become the Xi-Putin show, a summit on the sidelines to a soundtrack of shifting tectonic plates and pistols drawn at the border posts. What stands out for now is the basic cruelty here. This process automatically casts the athlete as the villain. Valieva will be banned, Valieva asterisked in the annals. But Valieva is also a child. If she was given a performance-enhancing drug then what we’re talking about here is abuse, an offence committed against Valieva not by her. The more urgent questions should be addressed to her coach Eteri Tutberidze of the high-functioning Sambo-70 school in Sochi, where very young children are taught to push their bodies to the limits, to live off “powdered nutrients”, to burn briefly as child-puppet athletes in pursuit of that sweet, sweet, physically ruinous power-to-weight ratio. Valieva can do these extraordinary things. She is currently the holder of eight world record scores and an almost unbroken run of competitive golds. Mainly, though, it’s all about the performance. She came out last in the free skate, half an hour after Zhu, and danced to Boléro wearing leg-warmers. It was visceral stuff. She reeled off a triple axel and it didn’t feel like a planned technical element, more that weird thing these athletic superstars do where they seem to pause the moment, bending space and time to their will, reaching out into the higher human registers of balance and grace. There was so much content in the routine, so much surplus brilliance, Valieva could even fall over and spring up without it seeming to matter much. At the end she was utterly spent, although that state of extreme exhaustion suddenly feels a little uncomfortable. And right now Zhu and Valieva, first and last in the same field, both look like victims, collateral human damage in the game of sport as geopolitics, sport as toxic global circus. The after-drama is yet to play itself out. But there is a kind of zugzwang here. There is no happy way for Valieva’s situation to resolve itself; and no outcome that doesn’t leave the Olympic Games looking just a little bit more rotten.",Sport/Sport,Kamila Valieva and Zhu Yi are victims in Winter Olympics’ puppet theatre of pain | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/11/kamila-valieva-zhu-yi-victims-winter-olympics-puppet-theatre-pain-beijing-2022
2/12/2022,"My uncle, Michael Alms, who has died aged 99, was an orthopaedic surgeon born in Japan who spent his childhood and youth in Britain. Told his racial background precluded him from becoming a consultant in the UK, he went to live in Canada. There he invented a device called the Alms retractor, for use in hand surgery. At his birth in Kyoto, he was named Tadashi Kubo. His mother, Naka Kubo (known as Kimi), was from a samurai family; his father, George Alms, was a captain and translations officer for the British Army engineering battalion stationed in the city. The marriage was felt by Kimi’s family to bring shame and disgrace, and they rejected the young couple. George returned to Britain, but Kimi remained to care for her dying mother, and Tadashi went to live with Kimi’s aunt and uncle. Their daughter, Masu, six years older than Tadashi, became Tadashi’s playmate. When Kimi and Tadashi left Japan in 1924 to join George in Britain, the family tried to erase all memory of them.  Arriving in Taunton to join George, Tadashi became Michael Alms. He was told little about his family history – his mother never wanted to talk about it. A sister and brother were born. Michael was educated at Bembridge school on the Isle of Wight. He studied medicine at Bristol University, graduating with its gold medal in 1945. In 1946 he married Beryl Norris (known as Goo), a nurse. He trained in general surgery (specialising in orthopaedics) at the United Bristol hospitals and, after further orthopaedics training at Liverpool University, and obtaining his MCh Orth in 1955, he became a senior registrar in orthopaedic surgery at the United Bristol hospitals. Despite his ample qualifications, he was told that because of his racial origins, he would never be appointed as a consultant surgeon. As a result, Michael, Goo and their four children emigrated to Canada in 1960. He worked as an orthopaedic surgeon at University hospital and St Paul’s hospital, Saskatoon. Later, he went into private practice. To aid with surgery of the hand, Michael invented an adjustable and self-retaining surgical retractor, designed to hold back the skin and soft tissues to maintain a clear surgical field. It is still widely used and is known as the Alms retractor. After Kimi’s death in 1990, Michael managed to trace some of his family in Japan from an old photograph. Seventy years after leaving Japan, he returned to meet the daughters of his cousin Masu. They had been told that her friend, a little boy called Tadashi, had disappeared and no one would tell her where he went. He introduced himself to them with the words, in Japanese, “I am Tadashi Kubo”. He remained in touch with them, visited Japan several times, and created links between the Japanese and British sides of the family. After finishing his private practice, he volunteered for Care International, first in the Dominican Republic, and later in Peru, before retiring properly in 2000 and settling in Vancouver. Michael was a keen sailor, golfer, photographer and potter. He was a founding member of the Saskatoon sailing club and sailing school and a member of West Point golf club in Vancouver. Goo died in 2000. Michael is survived by their children, Harriet, Richard and Georgie, and by five grandchildren and a great-grandchild. Another daughter, Charlotte, died in 2004.",News/Education,Michael Alms obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/11/michael-alms-obituary
2/12/2022,"It is the kind of news that calls for a stiff drink: the cost of a home-poured G&T is bubbling up due to a jump in tonic prices at the supermarket. Shop price data from the research firm Assosia suggests that the price of mixers made by major tonic brands such as Schweppes and Fever-Tree has risen sharply this month.  In Morrisons, the UK’s fourth largest supermarket chain, a number of Schweppes mixers, including bestsellers such as Indian tonic water, have increased by 10p to £1.75 for a litre. The cost of some Schweppes drinks sold in Sainsbury’s and Tesco has also increased. The data also reveals widespread price increases for Fever-Tree’s upmarket tonics. Since the start of 2022 Assosia has tracked 15 price increases for the brand in Morrisons, 16 in Tesco and Asda, and 21 in Sainsbury’s. A 500ml bottle of its Indian tonic water now costs £1.95 in Morrisons, a 15p increase. It costs the same higher price in Tesco and Sainsbury’s. With inflation running at a near 30-year high, tonic is just one of many products going up in price on supermarket shelves as supply chain bottlenecks and soaring energy costs put upward pressure on prices. This week, Lord Bilimoria, the founder of Cobra Beer, relayed bad news for beer drinkers, warning that soaring costs would push up the cost of a pint, too. “Our input costs in every way – bottling, energy – are up,” he said. The cost pressures bearing down on businesses were also highlighted by Unilever, the consumer goods giant behind Hellman’s mayonnaise and Marmite, which said further price rises were on the cards for shoppers as its own input costs were expected to jump by as much as £3bn this year. As well as rising ingredient, transport and energy costs, soft drinks makers have also had to contend with the rising cost of carbon dioxide amid supply issues linked to soaring wholesale gas prices. A spokesperson for the Schweppes owner Coca-Cola Europacific Partners said it had faced significantly increased costs in haulage, packaging, ingredients and utilities. With those pressures set to continue, it had “been necessary for us to increase some of the prices at which we supply our products to our customers”. In a recent trading update, Fever-Tree told investors that it too was facing significant cost headwinds However, it isn’t all bad news for gin drinkers, according to the supermarket industry bible the Grocer: the pricier component of the drink – the gin – does not appear to have been subject to any major rises.",News/Business,Not quite the tonic … sharp jump in mixer prices fuels G&T inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/11/sharp-rise-in-mixer-prices-fuels-gin-and-tonic-schweppes-fever-tree-inflation
2/12/2022,"Toy Story has become one of those Hollywood franchises that will never die, like Star Wars, Batman or James Bond. Some of us wondered if stretching out the much-cherished adventures of Buzz, Woody and the gang to a fourth instalment in 2019 was pushing it too far, only to be proved completely wrong by the geniuses at Pixar all over again. But now there’s Lightyear, the latest trailer for which dropped this week. And we find ourselves peering at it like the crew of the Nostromo inspecting Alien eggs. What is this strange concoction that appears to be a Toy Story movie of sorts, but one stretched out of all natural proportions, as if the movie screen has been dumped in a hall of mirrors?  Where are Tom Hanks’s Woody, Slinky Dog and Mr Potato Head? Why does Buzz sound like Captain America instead of Tim Allen? And who are all these space ranger types he seems to be hanging around with? Sunnyside Daycare this is not, even if Lightyear’s nemesis Zurg looks reasonably familiar at times. As has now been firmly prefaced by Pixar, the Buzz Lightyear of Lightyear is a very different figure to the one essayed by Allen, even if his costume and general air of heroism are somewhat recognisable. This Buzz is the real-life space ranger that inspired the toy bought by young Andy to be his latest plaything way back in 1995. He is therefore not the lovably hubristic figure of fun we meet in the first Toy Story movie, nor the still pretty silly but at least vaguely self-aware character from subsequent episodes, but a real-life, bona fide space hero, or at least a fictional one. Still with me? No? Well that’s hardly surprising, because for the best part of three decades, in fact since the very birth of CGI animated feature films, Buzz Lightyear has been defined by his very toy-ness. To expect us to reimagine him entirely after 26 years is a stretch indeed. There are certainly going to be a lot of kids with furrowed brows in multiplexes come June (if Disney, as we must hope it will, allows cinemas to show the movie). But perhaps I’m being a bit mealy mouthed here. This is, after all, Pixar. The last time they took us beyond Earth’s borders in a big way we were treated to the nostalgic cosmic joy of Wall-E, a paean to 1970s and 80s space and sci-fi movies with an environmentally conscious message 100 times purer and more vivid than the likes of Avatar. If anyone can work out how to completely reinvent one of the defining figures of an entire animated genre, it is Pete Docter (the film’s writer and Pixar’s chief creative officer). Moreover, Pixar is only doing the opposite thing to the makers of The Lego Movie. And if Buzz can be brought back as a real, live human (or at least an animated, fictional take on one – stay with me!) there ought to be scope for endless further meta-reimaginations. Perhaps Quentin Tarantino can be persuaded to make a bloodthirsty, B-moviesque prequel based on the rip-roaring adventures of the Roundup Gang, or someone else can develop a Disney+ show based on the animated, fictional porker that inspired Hamm the talking piggy bank. Maybe the whole thing can work in reverse (again) and a toy version of Luke Skywalker could maybe turn up in Toy Story 5! The only question here is how many Russian doll Buzzes we have to open before we find the real one … At what level of the Toy Story metaverse do we find the genuine article, and not just another copy of a copy of a copy? Think I’m making this stuff up? There are two versions of Zarg in the new trailer alone, for chrissakes, a robot one and an apparently real one. Do they play with the toy version when done conquering planets for the day? It’s all so bewildering, and it seems highly unlikely that the release of Lightyear this summer will do anything much to clear up the mess. Grownups, prepare for confused but happy questions as the credits roll. But be aware at the same time that all these heady, self reflexive twists and turns won’t stop junior asking for a Buzz Lightyear next Christmas. There’s just one question: do you buy the toy based on the toy, or the toy based on the guy who inspired the toy?",Arts/Film,To infinity and bewilderment: what on earth has happened to Buzz Lightyear?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/11/to-infinity-and-bewilderment-buzz-lightyear-toy-story-what-happened
2/12/2022,"At London St Pancras, a ghost station for much of the past two years, the sun was shining through the glass roof and Elton John’s piano, sealed up for Covid, was ringing out again. Happily for Eurostar, the start of the half-term getaway brought the return of queues of passengers snaking up along the shopfronts, heading to Paris and Amsterdam. “I’m so excited, I’m like a child!” said one woman lining up with her boyfriend for the 10.22am departure, a 22nd birthday present of a trip to Paris.  She was not the only one feeling that way. On the day many schools in England broke up and Covid travel restrictions lifted, tour operators and airlines have seen the first mini-boom of 2022. With families heading abroad on ski holidays and city breaks – and summer bookings flooding in – the battered travel industry expressed cautious optimism that this year normality is returning. Business has taken off since the announcement in late January that England’s Covid test requirements for the vaccinated would be removed, saving costs and hassle, and giving customers confidence to book after the uncertainty of the traffic light regime that changed permitted destinations weekly. The need for post-arrival or day two tests officially lifted just hours earlier at 4am Friday, and Eurostar, whose survival has been in question, was buzzing again. The cross-Channel service’s station staff were busy urging passengers to move along, prepare their negative Covid tests – still a requirement for France – and wear their masks. “Avancez, c’est bon, juste-là – it’s great to see that it’s so busy, but …” said one happily stressed Eurostar employee, herding people into the right queue. This is the first day, she says, in a long while that trains have been so packed, with 700 or so people on each. Several of the nine departures to Paris were sold out entirely. In the depths of the pandemic, the solitary daily train was barely occupied. Now there were couples off to Paris – “it’s Valentine’s, our first,” one said – as well as groups heading to the ski slopes, and families taking their first holiday since Covid. Kelsey Burden, from Chelmsford, clutching paperwork and a pram, was heading with her partner and two children to Disneyland. “It’s our first trip in two years. We booked a long time ago.” Not having to test on return was a happy bonus: “We’ll save a lot on the day two tests.” Pete Hovden, from south London, who works in IT, was taking his son Charlie to see Paris St Germain play football. The rule change hadn’t been a factor, he said: he had recently managed to go on a skiing trip that was rescheduled three times, and travelled round Europe during the pandemic. “I don’t think people worry so much after two years of this – they book and accept they might have to cancel,” he said. Travel agents say that the uncertainty has left many looking to experts to arrange their holiday. Hays Travel, which took over the collapsed Thomas Cook high street agencies in 2019, took a third more bookings the week after the change was announced, up to the level just before coronavirus first hit. Dame Irene Hays, the firm’s chair, said it was “remarkable to see”. Greece, Spain and Turkey were booking as ever but there was “phenomenal interest in destinations further afield”, from Mexico and the Caribbean to Bali and Dubai. Customers were spending an extra £500 for an average family holiday, she said, for better accommodation and a longer stay. EasyJet said ski, city and beach holidays had sold well, with Geneva, Amsterdam, Tenerife and Málaga the top destinations for a busy half-term. Spain, Portugal, Greece, Switzerland and Germany had all recently lifted travel test requirements for vaccinated UK travellers, giving “completely test free holidays options”, the airline said. MAG, owners of Manchester and Stansted airports, expects 1.5 million passengers over the next 16 days (with schools in some regions breaking up next Friday) – more than 20 times the number a year ago. “There’s a real sense of excitement for travel as we head into the summer season,” said chief executive Charlie Cornish. Gatwick was set for its busiest day of 2022 with about 50,000 passengers on Friday – and also announced it would reopen its South Terminal on 27 March, when British Airways will restart short-haul flights from the airport. Gatwick mothballed one of its two terminals in June 2020 when numbers had fallen by 95%, but now anticipates a busy summer, welcoming 5,000 more people back to work at the airport. Its chief executive, Stewart Wingate, said: “Things are shaping up quite nicely – this is remarkably different. Airlines want to fly and passengers want to travel. In a little over six weeks we’ll be starting to grow again.” BA will operate more flights to cities such as Barcelona and Lisbon this half-term after seeing a “boost to bookings” from the Covid test changes. At both Gatwick and Heathrow, unnamed volunteer employees were donning Peggy the Pegasus and Leo the Lion outfits ready for family check-in. Tenerife, Madeira and Lanzarote were the most searched for destinations, BA said, with holidaymakers flocking to the Canaries. One Canary Island exodus may not make a summer, some warned. Heathrow airport said it had seen an “Omicron hangover” affecting demand. And Abta, the travel association, said that half-term was promising but not a key moment for most tour operators. A spokesperson said: “Quite a few things still need to change and remain stable for us to get back to pre-pandemic levels – but it’s definitely improving. “There’s very much a feeling this year that people are going to jump on every opportunity to travel. A lot of people have decided, great, we’re finally going to go away – and [they] are off.”",News/Business, ‘I’m so excited!’: English enjoy lifting of overseas travel restrictions,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/11/covid-travel-industry-england-restricitons-lifted
2/12/2022,"Pressure is mounting on Italy’s Catholic church to face a reckoning on child sexual abuse amid unofficial estimates that the country could have the highest number of victims of paedophile priests in the world. Damning investigations into the scale of sexual abuse and cover-up allegations have dealt a severe blow to the reputation of the Catholic church in the US, Ireland, Chile, France and, more recently, Germany. But in Italy the issue has been mostly buried.  A group of religious and lay associations have now come together to push for an independent inquiry as well as to urge the Italian state to enact tougher laws to bring paedophile priests to justice and come up with a plan to protect children from sexual abuse by clergy. The group has launched the hashtag #ItalyChurchToo and will outline its objectives during an online event on 15 February. “The problem in Italy is enormous but it has been hidden,” said Cristina Balestrini, who leads a group for abuse victims and their families. “For example, two of the priests who celebrated my marriage turned out to be paedophiles. Then there was the priest who … raped my son. So that makes three paedophile priests, just in my small world.” Their appeal has been given impetus by the publication of independent reports in France and Germany, where the former pope Benedict was criticised for allegedly failing to take action against four priests accused of child sexual abuse when he was archbishop of Munich between 1977 and 1982. Benedict this week apologised for “grievous faults” in his handling of those sexual abuse cases, but his legal team denied any personal wrongdoing, provoking fury from victims. Hans Zollner, a German priest on Pope Francis’s commission to protect minors, has on several occasions in recent months called for the spotlight to be turned to Italy. “We need these investigations to be done and published in an objective way,” he told La Stampa. “And we need it in Italy too, that way we can look reality in the face and not continue to deny something that gets continuously denied.” Although the issue is being discussed by the Italian church, bishops are divided over whether the investigation should be independently commissioned. Gualtiero Bassetti, who steps down as president of the Italian Episcopal Conference in May, has spoken in favour of an investigation, as have two of his potential successors, albeit an internal one. “The reason they’re now saying ‘oh, we’re thinking about doing something’ is because they want to control the narrative,” said Robert Mickens, the Rome-based editor of the English-language edition of Catholic daily newspaper La Croix. “The initiative by the associations is scaring them to death, and they’re thinking ‘let’s do something that we can contain’, because they know that if they open it up to the outside world, they’re screwed.” There are no official figures on the number of clerical abuse victims in Italy, but the main victims’ association, Rete L’Abuso, has recorded 360 cases of priests accused or convicted over the last 15 years. A treaty between the Italian government and the Vatican means that the majority of child abuse investigations in Italy are carried out behind a wall of secrecy within the Holy See’s jurisdiction. If found guilty by a Vatican court, most priests end up being transferred to a new diocese rather than being defrocked or jailed. And if found guilty by an Italian court, few are actually imprisoned. France’s inquiry found that 216,000 children had been abused by clergy over seven decades. By comparing the number of priests in France, about 21,000, with Italy’s 52,000, Francesco Zanardi, who set up Rete L’Abuso, said the number of victims in Italy could be three times that of France. “It’s obvious that Italy is the country where the scandal could be worse, because it’s one of the countries with the highest number of priests in the world,” said Zanardi, who says he was abused by a parish priest from the age of 11 to 15. “There are also many foreign priests accused of paedophilia who have been given shelter in Italy. We need an independent inquiry; if the church does an internal one, it won’t be credible.” Meanwhile, the Italian government is yet to deliver on a request by a UN commission, which in 2019 accused it of being complicit in protecting paedophile priests from criminal charges, to devise a national plan preventing the sexual abuse of children. Campaigners are asking the government to enact a law, similar to one in France, that obliges citizens to report knowledge of clergy abuse. Although the number of churchgoers in Italy has been in steadily declining, the Catholic church still wields a considerable influence in society. The topic of clerical sexual abuse, at least when it comes to Italy, is rarely covered in the press. An Italian TV talk show was criticised for failing to question Pope Francis about the issue during the pontiff’s first interview on Italian TV last week. “I think Italians might be able to accept an inquiry, but the media would have more difficulty as there’s this kind of reverential fear, especially in state TV, in terms of the Vatican and in general the pontificate,” said Emiliano Fittipaldi, a journalist whose 2017 book, Lussuria, accused Pope Francis of doing “close to nothing” to stop clerical sexual abuse in Italy. “The only way for an inquiry to happen would be if Francis orders it.” The Vatican has been contacted for comment.",News/World news,Pressure on Italian Catholic church to face child sexual abuse reckoning,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/pressure-on-italy-catholic-church-face-child-sexual-abuse-reckoning
2/12/2022,"So much for the NBA’s most recent incarnation of The Big Three. On Thursday afternoon’s trade deadline, the Brooklyn Nets shipped James Harden to the Philadelphia 76ers for Ben Simmons, Seth Curry, Andre Drummond and two draft picks. The Nets had hoped that adding Harden to a mix of players that included another former MVP, Kevin Durant, and seven-time All-Star Kyrie Irving would make them title contenders. Instead, the group flamed out in little over a year. That the mix didn’t work, frankly, was not shocking. Acquiring Harden, who arguably deserved to win more than one MVP award during his time with the Houston Rockets, was always a barely calculated risk. Harden is one of the great scorers in NBA history, but he came to Brooklyn having worn out his welcome in Houston. Irving, meanwhile, forced a trade from the Cleveland Cavaliers and had spent his time with the Boston Celtics secretly plotting a move to Brooklyn alongside Durant.  The Nets had hoped that the talent on the floor would win out over any potential personality clashes. It wasn’t an utterly ridiculous notion, but the mix only occasionally worked. Harden’s arrival paid instant dividends for the Nets but he was limited by hamstring issues during last year’s playoffs, where the team lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in the second round. Any hope that the team would come together this season was dashed when Irving’s refusal to get vaccinated for Covid-19 ensured that he wouldn’t be able to play any home games. According to The Athletic’s Joe Vardon, Harden’s second-straight forced trade was at least partly because he and Irving – literally for much of the time – couldn’t play together. In the piece, Vardon quoted anonymous sources that there was tension between the two, partly because Irving’s vaccine status was effectively harming the team. With Durant out with a sprained MCL, the Nets have now lost their last 10 games and are eighth in the Eastern Conference. As a result, the Nets were forced to bite the bullet and do what no other team has been willing to do all season long: trade for Simmons. Simmons, an exceptionally gifted defender with an inexplicable disdain for shooting the ball, has sat out the entire season so far after a disastrous performance in last year’s playoffs ended any chances of him staying in Philadelphia. He is still just 25, a three-time All-Star with plenty of upside, but the Nets may have merely traded one headache for another. This is what the Nets do, however. They gamble. It was a high-risk, high-reward strategy to bring Harden into the mix in the first place, but they did what they think NBA teams need to do to win a championship. That’s what you do in the league: you try to land multiple superstars by all means necessary, surround them with affordable talent and then hope everybody’s healthy come playoff time. The Big Three concept was born in Boston in the 1980s when Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish led the Celtics to three championships. For our purposes, the modern-day conception dates back to a later Celtics team, the 2008 champions that included Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen. They provided a blueprint for the LeBron James-Dwyane Wade-Chris Bosh Miami Heat teams, who went to four straight NBA finals between 2011-14, winning twice. James replicated that success with the Cleveland Cavaliers, where he teamed up with Irving and Kevin Love. The Golden State Warriors then went above and beyond, adding Durant to a roster that already included a homegrown Big Three in Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. Barring the San Antonio Spurs’ win over the Heat in 2014, the three franchises accounted for every championship from 2012 to 2018. Winning championships by loading up on star players isn’t an NBA-centric concept. It’s been around in US sports at least since the New York Yankees were treating other MLB franchises as their own personal farm teams – and further afield Real Madrid’s Galácticos are perhaps the most famous example in soccer. It even happens in the NFL, as the Los Angeles Rams have proven by making this Sunday’s Super Bowl in part through a series of win-now trades. Still, the 2010s arms race in the NBA seems to have cemented the Big Three Concept as the only workable model in the league, even though that’s no longer the case. The Toronto Raptors, after all, ended the Warriors Dynasty in 2019 on the back of Kawhi Leonard. Last season, as great as Khris Middleton was for the Bucks, the reigning champions were highly dependent on Giannis Antetokounmpo’s NBA finals performance for the ages. Given the constraints of the NBA salary cap, it may actually be preferable to surround a single superstar with the right supporting cast rather than throw big names together and see what happens. The Harden-era Nets aren’t the first time a basketball team has flunked a chemistry test and it won’t be the last. There’s even a case to be made that the success of the Big Three model was an illusion. The Miami Heat weren’t just dominant because they had three superstars, it helped that one of them was James, who is at worst the second-best player in league history. James carried even more of the load with the Cavaliers team that won in 2016. The Warriors built their juggernaut around Curry’s league-altering three-point shooting. Even in the Original Big Three, Bird was clearly on top of that pecking order. For this reason, the Nets, who signed Durant to an extension last offseason, have reason to believe that the Harden trade isn’t the end of their long-term title hopes, even if this season seems a wash. With a healthy Durant, the Nets know that they can still compete for a championship if they surround him with the right pieces. Who knows, if Irving and Simmons actually manage to regularly appear in basketball games, it could even end up being them.",Sport/Sport,Could the James Harden trade mark the end of the NBA’s Big Three model?,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/11/james-harden-trade-nets-76ers-nba-big-three-model-basketball

Though the Taliban have detained and beaten Afghan journalists, the arrests earlier this week are the first time Afghanistan’s new rulers are known to have held foreign reporters since they took power last summer.  “Two journalists on assignment with UNHCR and Afghan nationals working with them have been detained in Kabul,” the UN said, without clarifying how many Afghan staff had been held. “We are doing our utmost to resolve the situation, in coordination with others.” One of those detained is the former BBC journalist Andrew North, who has long experience working in Afghanistan, including for the website Tortoise. He had recently recorded a From Our Own Correspondent piece for the BBC as a freelancer. His wife, Natalia Antelava, appealed for help to secure his freedom. “Andrew was in Kabul working for the UNHCR trying to help the people of Afghanistan.

2/12/2022,"On Wednesday Boris Johnson announced plans to end all Covid regulations in England, including the requirement to self-isolate if you are infected with the virus. Five people who work in public-facing jobs share their reaction to the news and what ending of all Covid restrictions will mean to them.  My particular concern is the suggestion that people will no longer have to isolate if testing positive for Covid, for which I haven’t seen any clear arguments or evidence given. Having recently had Covid despite being triple vaccinated, it’s not a very pleasant experience. My main concerns are for the medically vulnerable – of which there are many – and the unvaccinated. We have quite a few patients who we have been unable to persuade to be vaccinated and they remain at risk. I appreciate that we cannot expect people to isolate indefinitely with Covid, but think we should wait until the infection rates and warmer weather indicate that this would not be such a risky strategy. It should also, in my opinion, be accompanied by advice to people to not circulate freely if Covid positive, and unwell, but to be considerate to others in the community – the same should apply if people have flu or significant respiratory infections. Marta, GP, London I am deeply concerned about the prime minister’s decision. Most people of course are not touched too badly by Covid these days, if they have been boostered. But some still get very ill, or attract long Covid, and the long-term implications just do not seem to count, at all, nor vulnerable people and how to protect them well. I have to teach groups of students in poorly ventilated rooms, and it looks as if beginning the week after next I will just have to accept that there might be students in the classroom who know that they have Covid and yet have chosen to come to class, and cannot even be forced to wear a mask. I might be able to protect myself to some extent by wearing a mask, and of course everybody is free to wear one should they so desire. I’ve been lucky enough to have students this term and last term who have accepted that I prefer them to wear masks, so all my students have done so in class. But I know for some colleagues this hasn’t necessarily been the case throughout. And messaging from government impacts how people behave, and so if the message is “it’s all over and fine”, I think that will have an impact. Jane*, university professor, south-west England Regardless of the motivations for lifting restrictions, I think it’s good news for the live music industry. Those of us who work in industries that have been decimated by the restrictions of the last two years are eager to get back to our careers, passions and social lives. Money is often quite tight in the music industry, and there’s a limited capacity to reschedule. One positive lateral flow test can derail a project and cost a lot of money. Restrictions have been a huge necessity throughout the pandemic, and I’d never downplay Covid’s severity, especially in the UK. But if these industries are throttled any more, things like such as music events and tours are going to become unviable for anyone without a huge production budget. I don’t think society can be put indefinitely on hold. Just because I want society to resume, doesn’t mean I don’t care about vulnerable people. I have an optimistic view that most people will continue to be reasonable without the legal guidelines, and stay home if they’re unwell. The kind of person who goes to a concert with symptoms is already ignoring the rules. But I think most people aren’t like that, and will do the responsible thing. Harry, music producer, east London I have lots of high-risk colleagues who are understandably worried about the risk of coronavirus legitimately entering the workplace once restrictions are lifted, and we don’t have the luxury of being in a job where we can work from home. Isolating also felt very legitimised when the government said it was illegal to leave your house when you had Covid. Whereas now, particularly for education, if the government has not mandated something, it will not happen. So I worry that staff will feel obliged to come in with coronavirus, even if they are sick. Since December we’ve always had about 20% of our teaching staff off with Covid. We’re down to the bare bones. We can’t get supply teachers in either, so at the moment we’ll have two teaching assistants teaching a class, because there’s no teachers and no supply teachers. Ending restrictions will mean we will have more staff available, but we’ll also have to manage poorly children who shouldn’t be at school, but are because it is no longer essential to isolate. Sarah*, primary school teaching assistant, the Midlands I work supporting children aged six to 17 who are the main carer for someone with a physical or mental health difficulty, a disabled person or someone who misuses drugs and alcohol. Many of these caring roles are with clinically vulnerable or immunocompromised people. Many of these young people have already been forced to isolate longer than others to keep their cared for ones safe. We’ve continued to follow our own protocols around wearing masks, testing, group sizes to mitigate risks even as restrictions have lifted. We felt the route the government was taking just wasn’t safe for our young people. The alternative for them is they cannot come out. The respite breaks [we offer] are really important in terms of their wellbeing and mental health and creating a social network. I don’t quite know what we’re going to do going forward because we normally take them out to do things such as bowling or laser zone, but once the restrictions are lifted, they’re potentially mixing with people who have Covid and we can no longer reassure their families that we’re mitigating risks. The onus on disabled and sick people to have to avoid society just underpins some already concerning attitudes towards disabled people.

2/12/2022,"As dank, sticky and heady as the weed that has famously fuelled them, there’s a particular quality to a Cypress Hill track – one that has endured in a career of more than 30 years. To mark the release of 10th album Back in Black, the trio’s MC B-Real will be joining us to answer your questions. He joined the coalescing group in south-central Los Angeles in 1988, and their 1991 self-titled debut album was an instant hit. B-Real is of Mexican and Cuban heritage and mic partner Sen Dog also has Cuban roots, and the pair, backed by producer DJ Muggs, brought Hispanic lyricism and slang into their songs of gunplay and peacocking; their flow was simultaneously laid back and propulsive, and B-Real’s nasal, needling timbre was particularly novel.  The breakthrough teed up second album Black Sunday, which went straight to No 1 in the US, powered in part by signature track Insane in the Brain. Other tracks, such as I Ain’t Goin Out Like That, with its eerie guitar feedback, showed how DJ Muggs was drawn to rock textures, and the group further marked themselves out with collaborations with Pearl Jam and Sonic Youth, and a tour with Rage Against the Machine. In 2000, they gave this impulse full rein on Skull & Bones, a double album that featured an entire side of rock tracks. Its single Superstar – recorded in rock and rap versions with Eminem and Deftones’ Chino Moreno among the guests – became their biggest UK chart hit, reaching No 13. This summer, they’ll further underline their rock affinity by touring with Slipknot in the US. Cypress Hill stretched their genre boundaries further with the reggae-influenced Till Death Do Us Part in 2004, and later stepped into dance music with collaborators Rusko and Deadmau5. DJ Muggs has come and gone over the years – Back in Black is produced instead by Black Milk – and B-Real spent time in supergroup Prophets of Rage with members of Public Enemy and Rage Against the Machine, but Cypress Hill have never gone on hiatus, and that mic-swapping between B-Real and Sen Dog is just as gleeful as it’s ever been. Post your questions about their long career in the comments below by 6pm GMT on Monday 14 February, and B-Real will answer as many as possible. His answers will be published in the 18 February edition of the Guardian’s Film & Music section, and online.",Arts/Music,Post your questions for Cypress Hill,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/11/post-your-questions-for-cypress-hill
