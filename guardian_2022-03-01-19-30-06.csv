The aloo gobi looks after itself in the oven while you get on with making the lamb keema, so there’s only 30 minutes or so hands-on cooking time – the oven does the rest of the work for you. Perfect to serve for a weekend lunch with some lightly wilted greens alongside.

Tip all the aloo gobi ingredients into a roasting tin, mix well, then transfer to the oven to roast for 40 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oil or ghee in a large casserole dish, and add the cumin seeds. Let them sizzle for 30 seconds then add the onions and cook on a medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until golden brown. While the onions are frying, heat a second large frying pan on medium, add half the mince, break it up well and brown on a medium to high heat until dark brown and crisp. Drain the fat in a sieve set over a bowl (reserving the fat) and then repeat with the remaining mince. Once the onions in the casserole dish are golden brown, add the grated ginger, ground cumin, coriander, black pepper, chilli flakes, cinnamon and turmeric. Stir-fry on a low heat for one minute until aromatic, and then add the tomato paste and cook for a further minute. The mince should be all browned by now, so add it to the pan, stir, then add the stock. Bring to the boil, then bubble down for 5-10 minutes until the liquid has reduced, and is just clinging to the mince. You can add more stock if it gets dry. Stir through the frozen peas, cook for one minute, then turn off the heat and stir through the 100ml yoghurt. Taste and adjust the salt as needed. Once the aloo gobi is cooked (which should be around the same time you’re done with the lamb keema filling) very roughly mash it, taste for salt, and stir through a few tablespoons of the reserved lamb fat if you wish. Top the mince in the casserole dish with tablespoons of the aloo gobi mash, scatter with sea salt and a drizzle of oil, then transfer to the oven to bake for 45 minutes until golden brown and crisp. Serve hot, scattered with the freshly chopped coriander.

3/1/2022,"As fighting continues in Ukraine after Russia’s invasion, people have been fleeing to neighbouring countries. The Guardian spoke to people living in countries near Ukraine about the situation, how they feel about their own safety and what it might mean for them. When the invasion happened on Thursday morning I burst into tears, then I contacted my family in Lithuania. It felt like it was 13 January, all over again, when the Soviet Union attacked us on in 1991, when Lithuania was trying for independence. I was a teenager then and It was like a nightmare, horror, the sound of guns – but it also brought Lithuanians closer together. My father is Ukrainian. He is part of the older generation, who thought that the west was making up stories about the Russian invasion. My mum says he stopped watching the Russian news after the invasion. We have family in Ukraine and are ready to welcome them to Lithuania or Brussels, where I am now living. After not hearing from my cousin, for a day, we got a message telling us that the Russian army was not far away and they were ready to fight till the end against the invasion. His son is in the Ukrainian army. I am afraid for their lives. My heart breaks. I am afraid that Russia will invade Lithuania as well. And nobody will move a finger for us as we are so small. I pray it will not spread, because being independent matters. Kotryna, 45, from Lithuania and working in Brussels The mood in Poland I think is generally good – no one is scared because I don’t think anyone really believes that Russia will try to attack a Nato member state. I am angry and frustrated about what is happening. There is a lot of solidarity with Ukraine and a lot of us know someone from there. I took part in a protest on Thursday showing my support, and we’ve been trying to arrange donations. We don’t think Putin will attack our country but we are anxious he might cut off the gas and oil supply. It’s the economic effect that is worrying people which is why some have started trying to stock up. Igor Dudkiewicz, 23, law student, Poznań, Poland I felt very anxious when I heard about the invasion. I felt this rush of adrenaline and I just don’t know whatwould happen next. I felt like the people responsible for the invasion are completely insane. I couldn’t think of any proper justification for it. Ukraine is a country that has a similar culture to Slovakia and you begin to worry that what’s going on over there is going to come here. Is your country going to be the next target? What worries me is that in Slovakia there are a lot of people who would like to step out of Nato. Recently we had a survey and about 40% of Slovaks felt that the US and Nato were responsible for the rising tensions in Ukraine. I worry that there are a lot of people who may feel that this conflict is legitimate and caused by Nato and not by Russia, which of course is the utmost lie, but I don’t know how to counteract that. Michaela, 23, student, from Slovakia and living in London We’re all quite stressed. I skipped school today because the situation is quite hard to deal with. I’ll be back on Monday but on Thursday it was too much hearing talk about Russia possibly attacking us. Before, we were scared to speak our minds because we were worried about being attacked, but we’ve realised that the Russian regime is not as powerful as it seemed. Latvia is a Nato member state and it would protect us if anything happened. Both of my parents are in the military and I’m quite scared of losing them. I text my father constantly to ask how he’s doing and we watch the news all the time. Our government has said there is nothing to worry about but it doesn’t stop the panic. We haven’t packed any emergency bags yet but we’ve made plans about where we will go in Latvia – a place where there is food and water reserves, and is not near any military bases. Since 2008 when Russia invaded Georgia, we’ve understood that as long as Putin is in power in Russia there will always be a threat to us. At the time my dad packed his bags and was ready for army mobilisation. That was when we decided to make plans in case anything happens in Latvia. Elza , 18, student, Ogre, Latvia Most people in the Baltics have been very depressed for the last two days. There’s a deep sense of pain as we have been afraid this could happen and now it has. Most people want to stay optimistic and don’t want to plan for a war, however we have started discussing as a family where we would go if we needed to leave. It’s created a lot of uncertainty and some people are considering stocking up on food, at the same time many are level-headed and not massively panicking. I feel like the west’s answer has been too weak for Russians and it’s time for the rest of Europe to get uncomfortable. The leaders in the west are being too slow in understanding the full horror of what is happening. There is nothing really connecting us to Russia apart from our border. People in the Baltics have moved on from the Soviet era. We are hopeful and happy in Estonia that we have Nato membership, but at the same time we’re still uncertain as to whether they will really help us if anything happens. Tiiu-Ann, 37, production designer, Tallinn, Estonia I think we’re all a bit nervous. I’m not panicking but I don’t feel safe and I sometimes think about how me and my husband can prepare for war here in Poland. On Thursday, there were queues at the cash machines in my home town. There’s been something in the air for a while so over time we have collected some food, like rice and beans, water, money and petrol and I’m considering different scenarios just in case. I think if something happens our plan is to stay here as this is where my family lives, and where we have food and shelter. If we were to leave we would have nothing and have to depend on others to help us. When I think about the future I’m not sure about anything now. All I do know is that I wouldn’t believe anything Putin says. Some of my friends are a bit disappointed that Poland hasn’t done more to help Ukraine. But maybe we see it in a different way because of our history, when Germany invaded Poland in 1939 and we were left on our own with no help. Urszula Drabińska, 36, editor and proofreader, Wołomin, Poland I’m part Ukrainian, my grandfather was from there. I was brought up in Romania but I feel a lot of sympathy for the Ukrainians. What Putin is doing is unforgivable, but the EU’s response to his actions is pretty surprising. Why does no one help Ukraine? Why just sanctions? I feel like Putin will get what he wants and go even further, because no one is stopping him. I worry that he will not stop at Ukraine’s borders. With the humanitarian situation, I am proud that we are willing to take in refugees from Ukraine. I think we’re prepared to take about 500,000 of them. I felt really angry when I heard about the invasion and I’m prepared to enrol in the army if my country needs me.

3/1/2022,"The labyrinthine world of insects is in deep trouble. Scientists have uncovered startling declines in their populations , with the United Nations estimating that half a million species could be lost by the midpoint of this century. In writing about this silent unfolding disaster for my new book, The Insect Crisis: The Fall of the Tiny Empires that Run the World, I explored how the loss of insects imperils our food security, potentially deprives us of new medicines and degrades the ecosystems we all rely upon to sustain life. Through habitat loss, pesticide use and climate change, we are creating a version of hell for our greatest allies on this planet. But there is another reason to care about the insect crisis – their astonishing characteristics and abilities. Some seem otherworldly – such as the butterfly that has an eye on the tip of its penis. “Each insect is like an alien life form with a detailed life history that often is so bizarre, you couldn’t create it as fiction if you wanted to,” as Michelle Trautwein, an entomologist at the California Academy of Sciences, told me. Here are 10 of the most interesting things I found out about them. Most of us are aware of the crucial pollination role that bees play in ensuring a steady supply of fresh fruit and vegetables. But researchers have uncovered an array of abilities in bees that may cause some surprise. Honeybees understand the concept of zero, can add and subtract numbers and can even be trained to detect land mines more effectively than sniffer dogs. Their pollination services have become so valuable in the US that there is a growing criminal operation among “bee rustlers” to steal beehives in California’s farming heartland. Some bumblebees, meanwhile, are able to fly at an altitude of 5,500 meters (18,000 feet) above sea level (a height just shy of Mount Kilimanjaro’s summit), can be taught to play soccer and remember good and bad experiences, suggesting they have a form of consciousness. All of this is energy-intensive work. If a human male devoured a Mars bar, he’d burn the energy off in around an hour; a bumblebee of an equivalent size would use the same energy in just 30 seconds. The world is awash with not rats, sheep or even humans, but beetles – around 350,000 species and counting. Some have adapted to humanity’s altering of the world, such as the weevils that feast on our grain. Others are noteworthy in their own right. A horned dung beetle is so strong that if it were a human, it would be able to hold aloft six double-decker buses. Another type of beetle, a water beetle called Regimbartia attenuata, can even survive being eaten by a frog by swimming through the amphibian’s stomach and crawling out of its bottom. Mosquitoes are usually viewed as either an annoyance or a deadly menace. Indeed, there are fears that the threat of malaria and dengue will spread as we continue to heat up the world to mosquitoes’ liking. But some entomologists have warm feelings towards mosquitoes, pointing to their pollination of certain flowers and their little-known environmental work, where they help cycle nutrients through soils and plants and provide food for animals higher up in the food chain, such as frogs and birds. Wiping out all mosquitoes would cause a cascade of detrimental impacts. The only insects that rival mosquitoes in our displeasure are cockroaches. There are thousands of species of cockroach found in forests but we tend to focus on the two – American and German – that have adapted themselves to our homes. Objectively, these creatures are marvels. Slow-motion video footage reveals that the cockroach can crash into walls at high speed with no loss of momentum before scaling vertically. These great survivors can fit into cracks as thin as a small coin, bite with a force 50 times their body weight, and survive for two weeks after being beheaded. Insects may not be celebrated like horses, tigers or dolphins, but they have played interesting cameo roles in our own history. The common marsh mosquito was called the “founding mother” of the United States by one historian due to the malaria that ravaged the British army and helped force its surrender during the American Revolution. A century later, the emergence of modern beehive boxes unlocked the productivity of farmland and revolutionized agriculture. What would you think the first animal in space was? A monkey? A dog or cat, perhaps? It was, in fact, a fruit fly that was propelled beyond the atmosphere in a US military rocket in 1947 to ascertain the potential impact of cosmic radiation on astronauts. Moths are often slandered as powdery vandals that enjoy chomping their way through the clothes in our wardrobes. This is largely unfair - it’s the moth larvae, not adults, that feed on clothes, and even then only a couple out of the thousands of moth species do this. Behold, instead, the Hercules moth of northern Australia. The world’s largest moth, the species has a wingspan as wide as a dinner plate but no mouth - it lives off the food reserves gobbled up while a bulky caterpillar - and two false eyes in its rear to confuse would-be predators. Wasps aren’t just the pillagers of bucolic picnics. They are also important pollinators of plants and predators of the pests that chew through our most valued flowers and crops. Research has additionally found that paper wasps can grasp transitive inference, a logical arrangement whereby if A is greater than B, and B is greater than C, then A must be greater than C. These wasps can also recognize other individual wasps by looking at their faces. Enjoy chocolate? Be thankful, then, for the tiny midge that pollinates the cacao plant. Want a world with ice cream in it? Then you’ll want the pollinators that ensure dairy-producing cows have enough alfalfa to eat. Insects have been on the menu for societies across Asia, Africa and South America for generations but are still viewed with unease by many western diners. That may change as the ruinous environmental impact of meat eating prompts some to switch to insects such as crickets, which can be farmed in huge numbers with little resulting pollution. Crickets can be seasoned with chili; ants can be dipped in lemon. These are high protein snacks that could alter our relationship and appreciation of insects in general. Winston Churchill’s butterfly collection helped ease his depression. Walter Rothschild, scion of the banking family, enjoyed dressing fleas in costumes. People across North America plant milkweed to aid monarch butterflies. Giant burrowing cockroaches are doted on as pets in Australia. It’s lazy to dismiss insects as pests or irrelevances. Many of us see how precious they are to our world. That feeling will need to be multiplied, and harnessed, if we are to stem the greatest crisis they’ve ever faced.

3/1/2022,"In 2017, Alexander Ovechkin, inarguably the best Russian hockey player alive or dead and the country’s most famous male athlete, started something called PutinTeam. “I have never hidden my attitude towards our president, always supporting him,” the Muscovite and captain of the NHL’s Washington Capitals wrote, three years after Russia annexed Crimea. “I am confident that there are many of us, supporting Vladimir Putin. So let’s unite and show everyone a united and strong Russia!” Ovechkin encouraged other Russian hockey stars such as Evgeni Malkin, Pavel Bure and Ilya Kovalchuk to sign up to his social media campaign, and changed his Instagram avatar to a photo of him alongside Putin. It’s easy to imagine the smirk the Russian leader allowed himself at the sight of his new gladiatorial champion playing in front of adoring fans in DC of all places – the next year Ovechkin even hoisted the Stanley Cup for the Capitals. But it’s just as easy to picture Putin’s fury over Ovechkin’s comments following Russia’s full invasion of Ukraine last week. “Well, he is my president,” the 36-year-old Ovechkin told a press conference a few days ago. “But how I said, I am not in politics. I am an athlete and you know, how I said, I hope everything is going to be done soon. It’s a hard situation right now for both side and everything. Everything, I hope, is going to end. I’m not in control of the situation. “Please, no more war.” Mealy-mouthed as it was (“What!? Not only an alibist, a chicken shit, but also a liar!” spat Czech goaltending legend Dominik Hasek on Twitter, before calling on the NHL to suspend all Russian contracts), Ovechkin even tentatively distancing himself from Putin was a remarkable sign of something deeper. His words weren’t the strongest criticism of Putin from a Russian hockey player – that honour goes to Rangers left winger Artemi Panarin, who has also thrown his support behind opposition figure Alexei Navalny – but calling the Ukraine invasion a “war” at all is now a journalistic crime in Russia. Of course, the dissent of other Russian athletes across the spectrum, such as rising tennis star Andrey Rublev writing “NO WAR PLEASE” on the camera lens after a victory last week, is brave considering what Putin does to dissidents, even those who live abroad. (Panarin is on leave after reports emerged in Russia that he supposedly beat up a teenage girl, allegations that the team calls a case of vengeful “intimidation” for his politics.) But Ovechkin is no rising star. He is the pole star, “the Great Eight”, the charming and ebullient golden boy of the Great Russian Sport, perhaps hockey’s purest-ever scorer, now closing in on the previously inviolable goal record of Wayne Gretzky and doing so in the most glass-bangingly charismatic way possible. What’s more, hockey isn’t just Russia’s sport. It’s Putin’s. The Russian leader likes to lace up, and has got populist mileage out of skating in farcical games where he “scores” improbable numbers of goals against professional players (and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko) who are clearly terrified of him. He once tripped over a red carpet on the ice; most of the players pretended not to see. Just like the other action-figure poses that once made him something of an amusing meme, Rock’Em’Sock’Em Putin sends a specific message. Hockey has always been political for Russia and North America. The rink was where the cold war could get hot. Putin’s subsequent shame at the fall of the Soviet Union, too, is mirrored in what happened to Russian hockey. In the dying days of the empire, prominent Soviet players led by Alexander Mogilny began to defect to the west, and when the USSR collapsed then so too did the once-unstoppable Red Army teams that had dominated international competition for decades. In the early 1990s an American investor from the Pittsburgh Penguins flew to Moscow to find the Red Army team playing to empty stands, their trophies in a dusty cabinet and a strip club in the basement. The investor rebranded the team as the Red Penguins and whipped up sellout crowds with pumping music, cheerleaders and American-style capitalist razzle-dazzle. Putin would have hated it. Slowly, however, organized crime muscled its way in to cream off the new profits, just as Putin himself rose to lead a kleptocratic Russia that he was determined would be macho on the world stage again. Under his watch the KHL, Russia’s version of the NHL, even began to poach NHL players in return. So hockey is sensitive for Putin, and Ovechkin is sensitive for him, too. “As Putin’s favourite athlete, it’s significant that Ovechkin did not come out and endorse Putin’s war,” says Jack Todd, hockey writer for the Montreal Gazette. “It’s the first sign of any distance between Putin and one of his more enthusiastic supporters.” Todd argues that Ovechkin needs to do more, because he’s uniquely positioned to be heard: “Given Ovechkin’s position as a hero of the Russian people, it would be hard for Putin to retaliate against him, especially now when everything is crumbling.” Should Ovechkin and Panarin persuade the NHL’s Russian players to sign a joint letter asking Putin to withdraw from Ukraine, he notes, it could collectively insulate them from repercussions. For now, Ovechkin is playing the “I’m just an athlete” card so any such joint action looks unlikely in the short term. On Monday, the NHL condemned the invasion of Ukraine and urged “a peaceful resolution as quickly as possible”. The league added that it is cutting ties with its business partners in Russia, while acknowledging its players “and their families are being placed in an extremely difficult position”. A stronger stance from Ovechkin and his compatriots in the NHL could hurt Putin’s support among the kind of Russians who do not read dissident media but take pride in their country’s international hockey pedigree. They may even start to question the “special military operation” in Ukraine. After all, even the captain of PutinTeam now calls it a war.",Sport/Sport,Russia’s NHL hero Alex Ovechkin has a rare chance to hit Putin where it hurts,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/01/alex-ovechkin-vladimir-putin-ukraine-war-nhl-hockey-russia
3/1/2022,"The most astonishing thing about Bruce Willis’s debut album isn’t that it spawned a couple of hits – passable remakes of Under the Boardwalk and Respect Yourself. It isn’t even that top-flight soul artists, including the Pointer Sisters and the Temptations helped him out during the recording. Willis was then riding high as the star of TV series Moonlighting, bankable enough to shift records and attract big names. The most astonishing thing is that it came out on Motown, the most revered soul label of all time. In fact, Bruce Willis might be the last artist Motown’s founder Berry Gordy signed – he sold his interest in the label months later. What a way to go. You could argue that Donald Glover is technically a musician who became an actor – he started releasing mixtapes before he began writing for, and occasionally appearing in – 30 Rock in the late 00s. But his career as a rapper took off following his role in Community. The more successful he became as a writer and actor, the more adventurous his music became: on Awaken, My Love!, he abandoned hip-hop entirely in favour of a homage to 70s psychedelic funk, audibly under the influence of Sly and the Family Stone and Funkadelic, but strange and idiosyncratic enough to count as more than mere pastiche. Not just an album but one of the great WTF? moments in pop history. As Captain Kirk hammily bellows his way through recitations of everything from Hamlet’s soliloquy to Bob Dylan’s Mr Tambourine Man, it’s impossible to work out whether he’s deadly serious, sending himself up, or in the throes of some kind of terrifying public breakdown. Later albums where Shatner is clearly in on the joke, made with Transformed Man cultists including Ben Folds and Henry Rollins, are nowhere near as intriguing. Just as pop artists seldom get taken seriously as actors, so actors seldom get taken seriously as pop artists. Occasionally, that seems unfair, as in the case of Scarlett Johansson’s collection of Tom Waits covers, made with help from acclaimed art-rockers TV On The Radio and David Bowie. It relocates Waits’ work into foggy, dreamy soundscapes – clearly someone involved was a fan of the swooning atmospherics of the Cocteau Twins and This Mortal Coil – which is an interesting idea, while Johansson sounds a bit like Nico. The end result showed a lot more promise than some of the more dismissive reviews suggested. The standard route for latterday actors who choose to dabble in music seems to involve arty American alt-rock: they make albums designed with glowing reviews from Pitchfork in mind, with varying degrees of success. Ryan Gosling’s work as one half of the duo, Dead Man’s Bones, fits that criteria perfectly. But their solitary release, a kind of concept album about ghosts that makes surprisingly good use of a children’s choir, is a superior example of the type: eerie, atmospheric and appealingly dark in tone. Another album for which the supporting cast can take a lot of the credit. The star of Barbarella and Blow-Up – and later Gladiator and Gangs of New York – was a “fairly good” folk singer on the side, and, at the height of his 60s fame, a US record label teamed him up with producer Jim Dickson, who also happened to be the manager of the Byrds. He brought band members Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman to the sessions and gave Hemmings an unreleased song written by former Byrd Gene Clark, conferring cult status on Hemmings’ Dylan-esque vocals and semi-improvised raga-rock explorations. Foxx can really sing – and has the platinum albums to prove it – but your enjoyment of Unpredictable may rest on your tolerance for old-fashioned, incredibly slow, lubricious loverman R&B of the R Kelly school. If you’re in the market for songs that compare his partner’s profusion of cervical fluid during lovemaking to a rainstorm, or indeed a song about Jamie Foxx’s love of porn DVDs (“$39.99 for the new releases! I ain’t proud of it!”), then fill your boots. If nothing else, it’s that rarest of things: an R&B album with sleevenotes that list Dame Helen Mirren among its author’s “Ride Or Die Homies” According to sources as varied as Vogue and Rolling Stone, “twee” is having a TikTok-fuelled moment in 2022, which perhaps means the musical oeuvre of the noughties’ premier pixie dream girl Zooey Deschanel might be reconsidered. Her second album with singer-songwriter M Ward sounds exactly like you would expect of something made by a woman whose lifestyle website was called Hello Giggles – cutesy American indie-pop with a retro girl-group twist. But if you’re not sugar-intolerant, the songwriting is really good, and Deschanel’s voice is pretty appealing. An award-winning 2006 article by Australian journalist Jack Marx demonstrates how seriously Russell Crowe takes his music. Briefly employed by the actor as an unofficial PR, Marx was expected to convince the world to take Crowe’s music seriously too. “The most charitable thing I could feel about it,” Marx said of his latest CD, “was that it wasn’t complete crap.” If you were in a pub, where a band struck up with this passable rootsy pop-rock, you wouldn’t necessarily leave, but nor would you stop talking to whoever you were with. Grabbing attention from the start, thanks to her impressively committed approach to live performance – big on stage diving etc – self-styled “public servant of rock’n’roll” Lewis may well now be almost as well-known as a singer as she is as an actor. Her solo work has continued along the lines she started with her band the Licks: thrashy, visceral garage-rock with an electronic undercurrent, songs called things like I Know Trouble and Mean Machine. You’re never struck by the sense of someone dabbling, which is always the curse of the actor-turned-musician. There is a compelling argument that Richard Harris’s venture into music is the standard by which all similar subsequent endeavours must be judged. By no stretch of the imagination a great singer, Harris nevertheless had the good fortune to hook up with Jimmy Webb, one of the best songwriters of the 60s, who lavished on Harris a succession of incredible rococo songs and ornate arrangements: MacArthur Park is the most famous, but almost everything else is at the same level. The follow-up, The Yard Went on Forever, is fantastic too. If it’s tough for an actor to break into music, it’s probably tougher still for a comic actor to do so: the natural assumption is that whatever you release is intended as a joke. In Matt Berry’s case, it’s compounded by the fact that his musical inspirations are frequently far outside the usual canon of “classic” rock influences – he’s a huge Mike Oldfield fan and a lover of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Jesus Christ Superstar. But the music he makes is clearly serious (you don’t release nine albums in 10 years just for a laugh) and really impressive, as evidenced by The Blue Elephant’s spooky prog-rock-inspired song cycle.",Arts/Film,"Rock’n’role: a dizzying number of actors want to be pop stars, but which ones are worth listening to?",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/01/rocknrole-a-dizzying-number-of-actors-want-to-be-pop-stars-but-which-ones-are-worth-listening-to
3/1/2022,"Amid an upswing in anti-Asian hate crimes in America, a new exhibition at New York’s prestigious Fashion Institute of Technology will celebrate Asian American designers’ contribution to the fashion world. Asian American in New York Fashion: Design, Labour and Innovation will run until 27 March and features the work of Anna Sui, Shail Upadhya, Vivienne Tam and Zang Toi, among others. “With everything going on recently, we really didn’t want this exhibition to be a space where people were thinking about negatives,” co-curator Zoe Taylor told Women’s Wear Daily. “We wanted this to be a space for celebration, a space where people from the Asian American fashion community can come and see the actual faces of people who had been influential in the fashion industry. People who look like them and have made an impact.” In December a Chinese-American man died, after sustaining injuries following a brutal attack in April. The hate crime is part of an increase in attacks on Asian-Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in China. There have been other high profile attacks, including on the New York subway. A report earlier this month from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism revealed that anti-Asian hate crime in the US increased by 339 percent in 2021 from a year ago. Large cities like New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles all experienced jumps from 2020 levels. Designer Philip Lim said that he believed the Donald Trump administration had stoked this anti-Asian sentiment during the coronavirus pandemic with racist statements about its origins. “The past administration deliberately channeled the cause of the virus towards the Asian community using despicable phrases like ‘kung-flu’ and the ‘China virus’. This caused so much damage that is lasting and it has clearly led to an increase in violence in our community,” he said. Fashion designer Prabal Gurung added: “It is frustrating to watch the leaders of this country blatantly gaslight the American public with this type of xenophobic rhetoric.” The new FIT exhibition will be divided into two sections: the first explores the use of materials in the design process from the 80s to the 2010s, and the second looks at the variety of designs from the 50s until now. “The whole reason why we wanted to do this exhibition was as a celebration of the Asian American community and the impact that they have made on New York City’s fashion industry,” Taylor explained. Taylor added: “Although in the past maybe these designers haven’t been recognized as much for their contributions, it’s really exciting to know that we can display their accomplishments and achievements now, and show that these Asian American designers are not a monolith or one identity. They don’t create the same thing.

The Independent reported it with the headline “Tory chair gave ‘anti-woke’ speech at think-tank funded by tobacco and oil companies”. HuffPost gave its reporting the headline “Tory party chair Oliver Dowden likens ‘woke ideology’ to Maoism in bizarre speech”. Some commentators tried to cast his speech as part of the so-called “culture wars”; they seemed to only care about his use of the word “woke”, ignoring lines in his speech such as “we allow ourselves to be obsessed by what divides us rather than what unites us”. What I saw in his address was a defence of free speech, the promotion of small government and support for our long-held values. Defending great British figures like Winston Churchill should never be controversial. Dowden highlighted the point that is often lost on those commentators and Twitter warriors who spend much of their time talking down Britain: a lot of the world longs to be like us. They long to have our values and our way of life. While some of the language in his speech is harsher than I would use, this is in line with a radically moderate society: a society where we are radical in our care for one another and how we listen, but moderate in what we say and do. The societal debate around equality has become too polarising. We shouldn’t be picking sides; we should be showing compassion. It isn’t radically moderate to ruin someone’s life because they said something ignorant. It isn’t radically moderate to shut down debate and discussion. It isn’t radically moderate to disregard the experiences of individuals due to the characteristics they were born with. But it also isn’t radically moderate to boo individuals taking the knee – or taking other actions – to protest the abuse they have suffered. We all need to shout less and listen more. We must realise that giving no quarter is not the same as embracing ideas we disagree with. It is radically moderate to show care, to be kind and to be respectful. It is radically moderate to recognise that ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ and other communities still face social barriers. I represent a very diverse constituency. I’ve listened to my constituents, especially my British Caribbean constituents, who cannot escape that their heritage was blighted by slavery. I am currently in a fortunate position, but I came from a white working-class background. There are many minority-ethnic people who will not be able to place themselves in the same position that I grew up in, in the same way I cannot experience how their heritage affects them today. Just because we haven’t all been in the same position doesn’t mean we cannot listen to one another, hear, acknowledge, understand and act. The stories many of us tell are our everyday experiences. These stories are what we constantly feel. To show one another care and concern, and to try to change society so that certain hurtful experiences become less common isn’t giving in to ideas we disagree with: it is being human. This article is a call for us all to choose, in a radically moderate way, to be respectful of opposing opinions, to show compassion when we do not feel we should, and to listen sympathetically to those we disagree with. Only then will division end and we can come together to tackle the problems all sides face in a spirit of genuine tolerance and equality.

3/1/2022,"Millions of artworks and monuments are at risk from Russia’s military onslaught in Ukraine, with one museum already burned to the ground, the global arts organisation Getty has said. Ukrainian scholars are warning of an “unfolding cultural catastrophe”, Getty said in a statement from James Cuno, the president and chief executive officer of the J Paul Getty Trust. Fedir Androshchuk, the director of the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in Kyiv, said he was attempting to safeguard the museum from attack or looting alongside two colleagues and two armed police. “The museum is located in the middle of a rich cultural heritage area near three fine churches, but also close to some possible targets (the Ukrainian security service and border forces),” he wrote in an email to a Swedish academic. Getty said Russian forces had begun destroying Ukraine’s cultural heritage, including the Ivankiv museum, about 50 miles north of Kyiv, which housed “precious Ukrainian folk art”. Monuments at risk represent “centuries of history from the Byzantine to the baroque periods” and Unesco world heritage sites. Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs tweeted on Monday that 25 works by the folk artist Maria Prymachenko held by the museum had been lost. “She created world-famous masterpieces. Her special gift and talent captivated Pablo Picasso,” said the ministry. In recognition of her contribution to the field of folk art, Unesco, the UN’s cultural and heritage body, declared 2009 the year of Prymachenko. There are seven world heritage sites in Ukraine, including St Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, which contains unique mosaics and frescoes from the early 16th century, and Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, an Orthodox monastery founded in 1051. The entire ancient quarter of Lviv, dating from the 13th century, is also a world heritage site. Getty said: “The material cultural heritage of the world is our common heritage, the identity and inspiration for all humanity. Cultural heritage has the power to unite us and is critical for achieving peace. “It is also too often the target of war, another way to destroy and overtake a society by erasing its memory.” Much of the world’s ancient heritage had already suffered from “wanton destruction, looting, neglect, reckless overdevelopment, and climate change. To have even more lost to senseless war is unconscionable.” Getty said he condemned “the cultural atrocities being committed now in Ukraine, together with the unfathomable human and environmental losses. We stand in solidarity with our Ukrainian colleagues. Protecting and preserving our cultural heritage is a core value of civilised societies. What is taking place in Ukraine is a tragedy of monumental proportions.” In his email, Androshchuk said four museums – in Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Sumy and Chernihiv – had “managed to take down and protect their main exhibitions. In Vinnytsia, the museum building is now partly used for internally displaced people. So far I have not heard that any of the aforementioned museums has been subject to looting or attack.” But he added: “There is no guarantee that the Ukrainian cultural heritage will not be plundered and transferred to Russian museums, especially given that Kyiv has a special place in Putin’s interpretation of Russian history and its roots. “Many finds made in Ukraine during the 1800s and early 1900s are already in the two finest Russian museums. And there is also evidence that objects from archaeological excavations in Crimea have been sent to the Hermitage in St Petersburg.” There were “established instructions, dating to Soviet times, on what museums should do in case of armed conflict – to take down and hide objects in a certain order of priority and documentation. The problem is how to do all this with a lack of time and resources. “You cannot force employees to come in and work under such circumstances. Many are fleeing with their families. But I am very proud of my colleagues. Many of them came to the museum and helped to dismantle the permanent exhibition, pack objects, and store them in the basement. After this effort, two archaeologists and two young historians, my young colleagues, headed straight to the front. “At present, I see my mission as the following – to stay at the museum until the defence works.”",News/World news,‘Cultural catastrophe’: Ukrainians fear for art and monuments amid onslaught,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/cultural-catastrophe-ukrainians-fear-for-art-and-monuments-amid-onslaught
