DeBose won the prize for her role in the Steven Spielberg-directed West Side Story remake, in which she plays the key role of Anita, the girlfriend of Sharks gang leader Bernardo, and sings the famous number America. In the original film Anita was played by Rita Moreno, who also won the best supporting actress Oscar for the role in 1962. It makes DeBose only the second Latina actor to win an Oscar, after Moreno, and the first queer woman of colour. DeBose has already won a string of awards for her role in the film, including best supporting actress at the Baftas, Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild awards.",Arts/Film,Ariana DeBose wins best supporting actress Oscar for West Side Story,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/ariana-debose-wins-best-supporting-actress-oscar-for-west-side-story
3/28/2022,"US president Joe Biden has denied he is calling for regime change in Russia, after he said during a visit to Poland that Putin “cannot remain in power”. When asked by a reporter if he wanted to see Russian president Vladimir Putin removed from office he said “no”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, had already distanced himself from Biden’s comments, while the UK cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi distanced the UK government from his remarks. Representatives from Russia and Ukraine will meet this week for a new round of talks aimed at ending the war. Ukraine said the two sides would meet in Turkey on Monday. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy used a video interview with independent Russian media outlets to signal his willingness to discuss having Ukraine adopt a “neutral status”, and also make compromises about the status of the eastern Donbas region, in order to secure a peace agreement with Russia. But he said he was not willing to discuss Ukrainian demilitarisation, and that Ukrainians would need to vote in a referendum to approve their country adopting a neutral status. The UK Ministry of Defence said Russia is “effectively isolating Ukraine from international maritime trade”, in an update late Sunday. It also said Russian naval forces were continuing to conduct sporadic missile strikes against targets across Ukraine. Russia’s communications and internet regulator said in a public statement it would investigate the outlets that interviewed Zelenskiy, and has told them not to distribute the interview. In a separate late-night video, Zelenskiy promised to work this week for new sanctions against Russia and spoke of the impending new round negotiations, saying “we are looking for peace without delay.” Putin is seeking to split Ukraine into two, emulating the postwar division between North and South Korea, Ukraine’s military intelligence chief has said. In comments that raise the prospect of a long and bitter frozen conflict, General Kyrylo Budanov, warned of bloody guerrilla warfare. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram that online schooling would restart in the capital this week. The French foreign minister said on Sunday there would be “collective guilt” if nothing was done to help civilians in Mariupol, the Ukrainian city besieged by Russian forces. The UK government’s top legal adviser has appointed a war crimes lawyer to advise Ukraine on the Russian invasion. The attorney general, Suella Braverman, announced on Sunday that Sir Howard Morrison QC would act as an independent adviser to the Ukrainian prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, Press Association reported. Despite reports that Zelenskiy had been pushing to speak on video during the Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles tonight, and some statements of support from celebrities in his favour, it was not clear if the Academy had agreed, or if it would opt instead for watered-down references to the conflict and vague statements of support. There were signs of support for Ukraine on the Oscars red carpet, with stars such as Jamie Lee Curtis wearing blue and yellow ribbons.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 33 of the Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-33-of-the-russian-invasion
3/28/2022,"The cost of living crisis undermines the preferred election year narrative of a solid recovery from the pandemic. Politicians, irrespective of ideology, now find themselves trapped by rapidly moving events mostly outside their control. First, despite central bank messaging about transitory, low and gradual inflation, Australian consumer prices are rising at 3.5% annually with increases expected to accelerate. But the true figure is probably higher. One estimate puts actual US inflation at roughly double the official 7.9%. The Reserve Bank of Australia’s preferred trimmed mean inflation figure ignores 15% of the highest and lowest price rises. In the 1980s, a Latin American finance minister defended excluding items whose price had gone up sharply on the grounds that no one could afford them. Second, current inflationary pressures reflect an unusual combination of demand and supply factors, many of which are likely to persist. Demand has been underpinned by pent-up post-lockdown spending, low interest rates and central bank liquidity. Financed by central bank bond buying, government spending (sometimes poorly targeted) has substantially exceeded declines in income during the lockdowns. Simultaneously, short and long-term supply issues, now exacerbated by the Ukraine conflict, have created shortages of commodities, goods and services. Oil prices have risen five-fold since the artificial lows of 2020 due to energy politics and a poorly planned and executed energy transition to renewables. Higher food prices reflect extreme weather, especially droughts and floods. Supply chains have still not fully recovered from isolation requirements, mobility restrictions and border closures which disrupted production and transport links. As long as China’s zero Covid-19 policy continues, periodic interruptions of factories and ports are possible. Geopolitical tensions between the west and China and, now, Russia and associated trade restrictions and sanctions have affected trade, technology transfers and investment flows. All these factors result in higher prices, delays and increasingly unreliable availability. Third, policymakers lack the tools to bring inflation under control, at least quickly. Standard operating procedure is to suppress demand to match production. But winding back government spending, increasing rates and reversing loose monetary policies may jeopardise a fragile recovery in an economy addicted to stimulus and facing other hazards. Actions, such as a one-off payment to the worst affected or reducing taxes on fuel, will have limited and short-term impact. If not offset by adjustments elsewhere, they will add to – not reduce – demand, increasing price pressures and may worsen public finances. Increasing interest rates is problematic. With inflation high, to be effective, central banks would have to rise sharply – by at least 4 to 5% – to normalise real interest rates. In the “everything bubble”, such increases could trigger lower real estate and share prices, far beyond the relatively modest corrections experienced since late 2021. It would also increase interest expense on the high level of government, business and household debt, especially mortgages. Financial distress for over-stretched borrowers risks a new financial crisis. This means any rate rises will have to be carefully calibrated to avoid side effects, limiting their efficacy. Policy options on the supply side are limited. Financial finagling cannot control the pandemic, eliminate extreme weather, increase production of goods and services, or bridge geo-political divides. Governments can help expand essential infrastructure and correct workforce shortcomings but it will take years. The only other option – mandatory government price controls – has proved ineffective in the past. Where the market price is capped artificially, hoarding increases, black markets spring up and resources are diverted to seek better returns elsewhere. Finally, while paying lip service to price stability, government and central banks may have a higher tolerance for inflation for several reasons. Authorities have spent nearly 15 years trying to increase inflation to avoid deflation which could damage a debt-laden economy. Higher prices boost economic activity by encouraging consumption as buyers accelerate purchases fearing rising costs. Inflation is also helpful in dealing with the high levels of borrowing. It increases tax and business revenues to help meet debt repayments. It also reduces purchasing power, lowering real debt levels. It allows a stealth lowering of living standards and devalues the currency thereby increasing Australian international competitiveness. With wages unlikely to keep pace with this increase in prices (Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey controversially asked Britons not to request a raise this year despite the threat of runaway inflation), the cost of living crisis is unlikely to abate soon, hurting ordinary households and exacerbating inequality, irrespective of who voters put in charge.

3/28/2022,"Riz Ahmed, the British actor and musician, has won his first Oscar for Aneil Karia’s live-action short film The Long Goodbye, which Ahmed co-wrote and starred in. In his acceptance speech Ahmed, 39, said: “In such divided times, we believe that the role of story is to remind us there is no ‘us’ and ‘them’. There’s just ‘us’. “This is for everyone who feels like they don’t belong. Anyone who feels like they’re stuck in no man’s land. You’re not alone. We’ll meet you there. That’s where the future is. Peace.” Ahmed was nominated for an Oscar last year for his role as a hearing-impaired drummer in Sound of Metal, losing out to Anthony Hopkins. The Long Goodbye incorporates music from Ahmed’s album of the same name, which was released in 2021 and reflects on his identity as a British Pakistani artist. The film shows a south Asian family in suburban London whose preparations for celebration are interrupted by news reports of an all-white militia, who soon afterwards knock on their door. The win marks the first time someone of Asian descent has triumphed in the live-action short category. Ahmed’s nomination last year alongside Steven Yuen in the same category, was the first time two Asian men had been both nominated for best actor.",Arts/Film,Riz Ahmed wins Oscar for The Long Goodbye,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/27/riz-ahmed-wins-oscar-the-long-goodbye
