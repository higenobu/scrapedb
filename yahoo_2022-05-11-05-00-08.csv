5/11/2022,"A mother was convicted by a Texas jury after allowing her 13-year-old daughter to be sexually abused by the girl’s 47-year-old “husband,” officials say. The mother said the “marriage” between her daughter and the man “was a normal part of her religious beliefs” and that she consented to it, the Fort Bend County District Attorney’s Office. But by Texas law, the girl was too young to be a part of a legal marriage. The false marriage between the child and man went on for nearly a year before authorities learned of it in 2017, after the child revealed information about it during a doctor’s appointment. The 13-year-old said during the 2017 appointment that she was “sexually active with her husband,” according to prosecutors. Her mother was present during the appointment. The 47-year-old man was not the only person to sexually abuse the young girl, prosecutors said during court proceedings. Fort Bend prosecutors said the girl’s mother had also sexually abused the girl years earlier “under the guise of a different religion.” On April 29, a jury convicted the mother of continuous sexual abuse of a young child, and she was sentenced to 30 years in prison. “I take solace in this jury’s verdict, because it says that there’s a consequence awaiting mothers who fail to protect as profoundly as (the defendant) did,” lead prosecutor Charann Thompson said. Caseworkers from Child Protective Services helped support the child during the investigation and trial, prosecutor Jessica Ramos said. The child has been adopted by a new mother. “I applaud this child for her strength and resilience as she continues to recover from the crimes committed against her,” Fort Bend County District Attorney Brian Middleton said. “I pray that she is successful in all of her future endeavors.” House fire that killed 10-year-old uncovers harrowing child abuse claims, GA cops say Woman accused of killing dad says he abused her, AZ cops say. ‘Here to take his life’",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,"Mom let 47-year-old ‘marry’ her 13-year-old, TX officials say.

5/11/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - Asked if Russia would rule out a preemptive tactical nuclear strike on Ukraine, Russia's deputy foreign minister said on Tuesday that a decision on the possible use of nuclear weapons was clearly set out in Russia's military doctrine, RIA reported. ""We have a military doctrine - everything is written there,"" Alexander Grushko was quoted by state news agency RIA as saying. Russia's official military deployment principles allow for the use of nuclear weapons if they - or other types of weapons of mass destruction - are used against it, or if the Russian state faces an existential threat from conventional weapons. The decision to use Russia's vast nuclear arsenal, the biggest in the world, rests with the Russian president, currently Vladimir Putin. Russia's invasion has killed thousands of people, displaced nearly 10 million, and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States - by far the world's biggest nuclear powers. U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns said on Saturday that Putin believes he cannot afford to lose in Ukraine and cautioned that the West could not ignore the risk of the use of tactical nuclear weapons by Moscow. ""We don't see, as an intelligence community, practical evidence at this point of Russian planning for a deployment or even use of tactical nuclear weapons,"" Burns said. He cautioned, though, that ""the stakes are very high for Putin's Russia."" NUCLEAR STRIKE? A decree signed by Putin on June 2, 2020, said Russia views its nuclear weapons as ""exclusively a means of deterrence"". It repeats the phraseology of the military doctrine but adds details about four circumstances under which a nuclear strike would be ordered. These include reliable information of a ballistic missile attack on Russia and an enemy's attack ""on critical state or military installations of the Russian Federation, the incapacitation of which would lead to the disruption of a response by nuclear forces."" Putin, who has repeatedly expressed resentment over the way the West treated Russia after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, says Ukraine has been used by the United States to threaten Russia. He justified his Feb. 24 order for a special military operation by saying Ukraine had persecuted Russian speakers and the United States was keen to enlarge the NATO military alliance in a way that would endanger Russia. U.S. President Joe Biden casts Putin's invasion of Ukraine as a fight in a much broader global battle between democracy and autocracy. He has also called Putin a war criminal and has said the former KGB spy cannot remain in power. Ukraine dismisses Russian claims that it persecuted Russian speakers and says it is fighting for its survival. Russia denies Ukrainian and Western accusations that its forces committed war crimes.
