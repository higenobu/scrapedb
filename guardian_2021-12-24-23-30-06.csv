12/24/2021,"The most widespread symptoms of the Omicron variant now match those of common colds, with calls for the government to update its public health messaging to include a wider number of likely Covid symptoms. The most common symptoms reported among users of the Zoe Covid app have been a running nose, headaches, fatigue, sneezing and sore throats, according to the study’s most recent analysis of confirmed cases in London.  Half of those reporting cold-like symptoms also tested positive for Covid, with no clear difference in the symptoms reported for Delta or Omicron infections. But only about half of infected users also reported the “classic three symptoms of fever, cough, or loss of sense of smell or taste”, according to the Zoe analysis. The Zoe analysis was supported by the Sage committee of scientific advisers at a meeting held on Thursday. The committee said there was “preliminary evidence” of changes in symptoms accompanying Omicron infections, as loss of taste or smell “seem to be reported less frequently”. Prof Tim Spector, lead scientist on the Zoe Covid study, said public messaging needed to acknowledge that Covid symptoms will appear more like a common cold to many of those infected. Spector said he was shocked by what he called “misinformation” in the government’s latest stay-at-home guidance about the symptoms of Covid. “Zoe data clearly shows that the most important symptoms are no longer a new continuous cough, a high temperature or loss of taste or smell. “For most people, an Omicron positive case will feel much more like the common cold, starting with a sore throat, runny nose and a headache. You only need to ask a friend who has recently tested positive to find this out,” Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London, told the PA news agency. “We need to change public messaging urgently to save lives as half of people with cold-like symptoms now have Covid.” The NHS website currently lists the “main symptoms of coronavirus” as a high temperature; a new, continuous cough including coughing a lot for more than an hour; a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. It advises people with any of the three symptoms to get a PCR test as soon as possible and self-isolate. Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London speaking in a personal capacity, said there was evidence that the virus was changing the way it behaved, in terms of cells that it infected, leading to changing symptoms. Recent data, including a study from Hong Kong, found that Omicron was less able to infect deep lung tissue but more able to infect higher bronchial tissue. “It appears to be shifting towards a virus that infects higher up in the respiratory tract and is therefore adapting to be more transmissable partly because it is changing the cell types it infects,” Openshaw said. “That would go along with it producing more common-cold-like symptoms. Those laboratory studies support what the Zoe app is telling us.” Openshaw said it would be “sensible” to update the list of Covid symptoms: “The semi-lockdown has been terrible for colds, they are struggling to survive. So if you have a cold at the moment, there’s about a 50% chance that it is actually Covid.”",News/World news,Omicron’s cold-like symptoms mean UK guidance ‘needs urgent update’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/24/omicron-covid-symptoms-uk-guidance-zoe-study
12/24/2021,"Known as the masterplanner of the successful 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, the architect Oriol Bohigas, who has died aged 95, was a fierce defender of urban planning as a political and social act. He played a critical role in the cultural and political life of his city, influencing generations of urban theorists and practitioners. As leader of Barcelona’s urban planning department in the mid-1980s, Bohigas conceptualised and implemented the “Barcelona model” that formed the urban backbone to the city’s Olympics. This event and its lasting legacy put the grey, debilitated but fiercely independent city, punished by decades of Francoism, firmly on the international map. Twenty years later, the Barcelona model informed London’s approach of using the Olympic Games as an opportunity to create an integrated piece of city with housing and amenities for the capital’s more deprived neighbourhoods.  With the death of Franco in 1975, Barcelona had grasped the opportunity to democratise and modernise. Working closely with the first socialist mayors of the post-Franco era, Narcís Serra and Pasqual Maragall, Bohigas created the intellectual and spatial armature for its transformation. He was committed to innovation through continuity rather than aggressive rupture and restructuring, and recognised that the public spaces of the city – the pavements, streets, squares, parks, beaches and waterways – should be at the heart of a democratic vision of the contemporary city. Bohigas built on the canonical work of the father of modern urbanism, Idelfonso Cerda, who in the mid-19th century had created a plan for the growing city with an elegant and functional diagonal grid known as the Eixample. With its tree-lined avenues and pedestrian friendly ramblas, generous public spaces and community parks, Cerda’s Grid served the city well. Bohigas re-interpreted this model for the 20th century, upgrading the public realm, intensifying its local neighbourhoods and reuniting the city with its seafront on the Mediterranean. “Monumentalise the periphery; functionalise the centre” was Bohigas’ linguistically obtuse slogan for re-energising Barcelona. This translated into a focused programme of interventions that gave dignity to deprived neighbourhoods – such as the working-class district of Poble Nou – and made the dense inner-city districts more liveable, with pocket parks, markets, play areas and local amenities. In the space of two decades much was achieved. In recognition of this collective effort, the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) broke with tradition in 1999 and awarded the City of Barcelona – and not an individual or group of architects – the royal gold medal. Bohigas was one of five individuals singled out in the citation. Equally sharp in manner of speech and dress – he spoke in short, staccato sentences delivered with rasping gravitas and wore immacutely ironed shirts, linen jackets and colourful socks – Bohigas had the air of a fin-de-siècle aesthete but the mind of a pragmatist. He was outspoken, often pugnacious, but always with a glint in his eye. He was keen to get things done, and resigned as elected councillor in charge of culture in 1991 when he felt Maragall was too slow in implementing one of his pet projects for neighbourhood libraries. Born in Barcelona, Orilo was the son of middle-class Catalan intellectuals, María Guardiola and Pere Bohigas, a professor of linguistics. His high school friend Josep Martorell convinced him to enrol in 1943 at Barcelona’s school of architecture, ETSAB, which he would go on to lead as director from 1977 to 1980. In his 30s, he formed the militantly pro-modern R Group and had the temerity to write to the architect Mies van der Rohe to propose the reconstruction of his elegantly minimalist Barcelona Pavilion, which had been designed for the 1929 International Exposition and torn down the following year. Happily, this plan was realised in 1986 and the reconstructed modern masterpiece stands in Montjuïc Park. With Martorell and David Mackay, Bohigas formed MBM Arquitectes, one of Spain’s most successful design practices, with a significant portfolio of public and private buildings that adhered to the principles of low-key, contextual modernism. Their buildings prioritised the relationship to the city rather than gymnastic self-promotion. For example, their design for the 1992 Olympic Village is memorable for the way in which the layout of the urban blocks opens out towards the sea, reconnecting the old city with its waterfont. Bohigas provided the critical intellectual and theoretical underpinning to the practice. He was a founding member of the publisher Edicions 62, an editor of the journal Arquitecturas Bis (1974-85) and chair of the Fundació Joan Miró museum (1981-88). He published more than 15 books, including Barcelona Entre el Pla Cerdà i el Barraquisme (1963, Barcelona Between the Cerdà Plan and Shanty-towns ). He argued strongly for the social responsibility of the architect. In a letter addressed to a member of the urban planning commission of Barcelona city council in 1964, he made his view explicit: “To be an urban planner is to begin to be a socialist now.” Together with the director of urban projects of Barcelona city council, Josep Acebillo, Bohigas was responsible for selecting some of the most talented final-year students - the so-called “golden pencils” – from the ETSAB architecture school and giving them responsibility for coming up with ideas for individual city districts. He also played an important role in attracting international figures, from Arata Isozaki to Frank Gehry, to build in Barcelona and giving opportunities to locally trained, younger architects to make their mark on its urban landscape. Bohigas believed that the cumulative effect of small, “punctual” projects – often referred to as urban “acupuncture” – could be more effective than large-scale, complex initiatives that took years to implement and required budgets that did not exist in Spain’s fragile early democracy. This approach can be seen as a precursor to the current vogue for “tactical urbanism”, whereby small-scale improvements – pavement widening, outdoor seating, street closures, tree-planting – are implemented quickly and on a temporary basis in close cooperation with local communities. In the 1960s and 70s, Bohigas was associated with Gauche Divine, a group of left-leaning intellectual bourgeois artists, film-makers, philosophers and artists who met regularly at the Boccaccio discotheque in Barcelona. Their spirit shaped not only his professional but also his social life. In the late 1970s, Bohigas and his partner, the landscape architect Beth Galí, turned their apartment in Plaza Reial – in what was then a run-down area of the old city – into a salon of international cultural exchange and heated debates on city politics. Bohigas, often accompanied by whiskey and a cigar, would argue deep into the night with professionals and politicians of different generations and persuasions in one of the most beautiful squares at the very heart of his beloved city. He is survived by Beth; by his wife, Isabel Arnau, from whom he was separated, and their five children, Josep, Gloria, María, Eulalia and Pere, nine grandchildren and a great-granddaughter.

12/24/2021,"Passengers travelling home for Christmas have been hit with disruption worldwide after airline companies cancelled more than 2,000 flights on Friday, according to a flight tracking website. The surge of Christmas Eve cancellations came as the rapidly spreading Omicron coronavirus variant meant carriers were unable to staff their flights.  The bulk of the cancellations came from five firms, with China Eastern cancelling 474 journeys, while Air China scrapped 188. United cancelled 180 flights, Air India 160 and Delta called off 127. At time of writing, the flight tracking firm FlightAware said 2,031 Christmas Eve flights had been cancelled globally, including 448 in the US. “The nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation. As a result, we’ve unfortunately had to cancel some flights and are notifying impacted customers in advance of them coming to the airport,” United said on Thursday. Meanwhile, Delta said it had “exhausted all options and resources – including rerouting and substitutions of aircraft and crews to cover scheduled flying – before cancelling around 90 flights for Friday”. The airline blamed the impact of the Omicron variant and weather conditions for the cancellations. In response to the pre-holiday chaos, airlines have called for the relaxation of quarantine rules for vaccinated staff. Delta’s chief executive, Ed Bastian, has asked the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to reduce the self-isolation period for vaccinated people experiencing breakthrough infections from 10 to five days. Airlines for America and JetBlue seconded the request. Airlines’ social media feeds have been filled with frustrated passengers asking for assistance after a spate of cancellations on Christmas Eve due to the rapidly spreading Omicron variant. “@Delta really?! You cancel my Christmas Eve flight at 12:30am?? I got up at 2am to get to the airport with my baby and husband and don’t see the cancellation till I’m at the airport to get my bags checked,” one passenger tweeted at the airline on Friday – one of several similar messages directed at carriers that have had to call off flights.",News/Business,"Christmas Eve travel chaos as airlines cancel more than 2,000 flights",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/24/christmas-eve-travel-chaos-as-airlines-cancel-more-than-2000-flights
12/24/2021,"Six of the nine runners for the King George VI Chase on Boxing Day have at least one Grade One win to their name already and five are expected to start single-figure odds, so the 2021 running of Kempton Park’s showpiece event has fair claims to be not only the strongest renewal this century but also the most competitive. Two serious contenders from Ireland - including Minella Indo, last season’s Gold Cup winner – add to the depth in a race that has not crossed the water since Kicking King’s second win in 2005, and Rachael Blackmore’s mount is priced up alongside Clan Des Obeaux, the King George winner in 2018 and 2019, at around 3-1 as the market struggles to find an outright favourite.  Frodon and Bryony Frost, who led all the way last year to win at 20-1, will go off at around 6-1 this time around, as will Chantry House, a dual Grade One winner as a novice last season. Asterion Forlonge, Saint Calvados and the mercurial Lostintranslation also arrive at Kempton with a chance on the pick of their form, so the only guarantee this year is that finding the winner on Sunday afternoon will be well worth the effort. Anyone who simply wants to back the best horse need look no further than Minella Indo, who is 3lb in front of Clan Des Obeaux on the official numbers and 5lb ahead according to the much-respected Timeform organisation. Finding the best bet in the race, however, is a different puzzle entirely, as Minella Indo’s best form has come at Cheltenham and he needed every yard of the extended three-and-a-quarter miles to get the better of A Plus Tard in the Gold Cup. Sunday’s race is a very different test, and while Blackmore has a rare talent for adapting her tactics to suit the situation at hand, Minella Indo was only fourth in the Irish Gold Cup over three miles in February and was a beaten favourite too – behind Frodon - on his seasonal debut at Down Royal in October. Henry de Bromhead’s chaser was fully entitled to need that run after a 225-day break but he still makes more appeal at 5-1 for the Gold Cup in March than he does for Sunday’s race at 3-1. Clan Des Obeaux is the opposite, a horse who is ideally suited to Sunday’s track and trip and highly unlikely even to get an entry in the Gold Cup. He is now almost 10, however, was below his best behind Frodon 12 months ago and has not seen a racecourse since Punchestown in April. Paul Nicholls has saddled a dozen King George winners and has no equals when it comes to getting a horse fit first time up, but a nine-year-old Clan Des Obeaux’s best may no longer be quite enough. Frodon and Frost were worthy winners last season and will again be very difficult to overhaul in the straight if they can settle into their usual rhythm. But they are unlikely to be allowed such an easy time of it in front and this also looks like a stronger race. The juice has been squeezed out of Chantry’s House’s odds in recent days and he has too much to find with the principals to be of any interest at around 5-1. As a result, the price that leaps out at the likely odds is the 7-1 about Asterion Forlonge (3.05). Willie Mullins’s seven-year-old made a slow start over fences, falling in two of his first three chase starts, but his 14-length win off 152 in a handicap at Punchestown in April was backed up by an excellent time and he looked a very likely winner when he unseated Bryan Cooper three out in a strong renewal of the John Durkan at the same track earlier this month. The grey’s jumping had been sound to that point, as it was when he won in the spring, and he also seems well suited to a right-handed track. He looks overpriced to give Mullins his second King George winner, 20 years on from his first win with Florida Pearl. Kempton Park 1.20 Jacamar is still winless after three starts over fences but has shown something to work on in all three. He was clear of two previous winners at Wincanton last time, has cheekpieces applied to help his concentration and looks too big as the outsider of the field at around 14-1. Kempton Park 1.55 A fascinating head-to-head in prospect between Ahoy Senor and Bravemansgame, the best staying novices of the season so far. At the likely odds, marginal preference is for Lucinda Russell’s six-year-old, who stormed 31 length clear of the runner-up at Newbury last time.

12/24/2021,"America’s longest running oil spill dispute is close to a resolution after a Louisiana-based energy firm has agreed to a proposed multi-million dollar settlement. Taylor Energy agreed to pay more than $43m in clean-up costs, civil penalties and natural resource damage, and transfer a $432m clean-up trust fund to the Department of Interior, according to a proposed settlement announced by the Department of Justice.  The proposed agreement stems from more than a dozen Taylor Energy-owned wells in the Mississippi Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico that began leaking after a production platform was damaged by Hurricane Ivan in 2004. The pipeline has lost hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil, and continues to leak. “Offshore operators cannot allow oil to spill into our nation’s waters,” said Todd Kim, assistant attorney general for the DoJ’senvironment and natural resources division, adding: “If an oil spill occurs, the responsible party must cooperate with the government to timely address the problem and pay for the cleanup.” As part of the settlement, Taylor Energy will withdraw three existing lawsuits it filed against the government and will not be required to admit “any liability to the United States or the State arising out of the MC-20 Incident.” The agreement will now put before a court’s review and approval. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s national ocean service, said in a statement that the “settlement represents an important down payment” to the costs of the environmental clean-up. “Millions of Americans along the Gulf Coast depend on healthy coastal ecosystems. Noaa and our co-trustees look forward to working in partnership with the National Pollution Funds Center to ensure the region and the ecosystem can recover from this ongoing tragedy,” said Nicole LeBoeuf, national ocean service director The spill began 17 years ago when a cluster of pipes connecting sixteen wells off the Louisiana coast were damaged by a subsea mudslide caused by the toppling of a Taylor production platform by hurricane winds. The company plugged nine wells but has said it cannot plug the rest. The Coast Guard said a system had captured and removed more than 800,000 gallons of oil since April 2019. Taylor Energy sold its oil and gas assets in 2008, according to its website. The trust fund will be created to plug the wells, as well as to permanently decommission the platform and clean contaminated soil. The agreement, if approved, will also settle a series of legal disputes over the costs of the clean-up. “Despite being a catalyst for beneficial environmental technological innovation, the damage to our ecosystem caused by this 17-year-old oil spill is unacceptable,” said Duane Evans, US attorney for the eastern district of Louisiana.",News/US news,Louisiana energy firm to pay millions following oil spill that began 17 years ago,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/24/louisiana-taylor-energy-to-pay-millions-oil-spill
12/24/2021,"The actor and director James Franco has been accused of being “completely insensitive” and of causing “immense pain and suffering” after an interview made public on Wednesday in which he admitted sleeping with students at his acting school and claiming that he suffered from sex addiction. A statement from lawyers representing two women who brought a civil suit against Franco in 2019 said that Franco, who made comments on SiriusXM’s The Jess Cagle Podcast, was “completely insensitive to, and still apparently does not care about, the immense pain and suffering he put his victims through”.  The statement added: “[Franco] continues to downplay the survivors’ experiences and ignore their pain, despite acknowledging he had no business starting such a school in the first place … It was, and is, despicable conduct.” In June 2021, Franco settled a class action suit for $2.2m (£1.64m) after the two women, Sarah Tither-Kaplan and Toni Gaal, filed a complaint against the actor, accusing him of fraud, after Tither-Kaplan and several other women aired claims of sexual exploitation in a 2018 article in the Los Angeles Times. Both women received substantial sums in the settlement, alongside other students of Franco’s Studio 4 film school, which was set up in 2014 and closed in 2017.

12/24/2021,"The UK’s benchmark stock market index hit a 22-month high on Friday, coming within touching distance of the levels seen in February 2020 just before stock markets around the world were sent into a tailspin by the first European lockdown. The FTSE 100 hit an intra-day high of 7,403.65 points – surpassing the previous post-lockdown high that it hit last month – before slipping back one point to close at a Christmas Eve loss.  Traders on the London Stock Exchange downed tools at 12:30pm on Friday to mark Christmas Eve, while exchanges across much of Europe were closed. Markets have been boosted in recent days by data suggesting that the latest variant of concern, Omicron, is not as severe as previously thought. British Airways owner International Airlines Group was among the biggest gainers, up 1.9%, while hotels group Intercontinental also edged up by 1.2% – both are particularly sensitive to pandemic restrictions. The cautious optimism around Omicron has helped the FTSE 100 to gain 4.4% so far during December. That would be its best month since November 2020, when news of Pfizer’s first successful vaccine prompted a global rally. The morning rally left the FTSE just shy of its closing point on Friday 21 February 2020 of 7,403.92 – the day Italy imposed a lockdown in the regions of Lombardy and Padua, sending markets around the world plummeting when they reopened the next Monday. The value of the FTSE 100 companies dropped by £62bn that day. Investors look out for a “Santa rally” on markets at the end of the year, as the low volumes combine with other factors that may include end-of-year portfolio adjustments. The S&P 500, Wall Street’s benchmark, appeared to catch that mood with a fresh record high on Thursday, although the positive sentiment faded on the FTSE 100 on Friday. Fawad Razaqzada, an analyst at ThinkMarkets, an investment website, said markets had rallied in the last week thanks to optimism over Omicron. People with the variant are estimated to be between 31% and 45% less likely to attend A&E compared with the Delta variant, and 50% to 70% less likely to be require admission to hospital, the UK Health Security Agency reported on Thursday. Razaqzada said: “Judging by the stock market rally this week, it appears as though investors are still confident that the ongoing recovery from the pandemic recession can survive the Omicron wave.” Chris Beauchamp, an analyst at IG, a trading platform, said: “The FTSE 100 has not had as stellar a year as some, but the recovery to 7,400 today puts it in good stead for the year ahead, and means a run at the pre-pandemic highs could still be possible if Omicron concerns can be kept under control and earnings continue to recover in the fashion they have throughout 2021.”",News/Business,‘Santa rally’ sees FTSE 100 hit 22-month high on Omicron optimism,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/24/ftse-100-index-omicron-variant-optimism
