3/25/2022,"A judge has said he is considering a life behind bars for a woman who laughed while waiting to be sentenced for raping a young girl. Vicki Bevan, 37, admitted raping and carrying out sex acts on her victim with Paul Rafferty, 62. She also molested the victim with a second man, 42-year-old Tony Hutton. The abuse was filmed and photographed, which ultimately led to the arrest of the trio from St Helens, Merseyside. The ""depraved"" paedophiles were due to be sentenced on Friday, but Judge Andrew Menary QC, adjourned the proceedings, telling Bevan: “Just when you think you have heard the worst, another one comes along”. Standing in the dock, Bevan laughed and smiled with the prison officers in the dock before wiping away tears with a white tissue when the judge came into court. Judge Menary said he is considering an “indefinite” or life sentence for Bevan.
