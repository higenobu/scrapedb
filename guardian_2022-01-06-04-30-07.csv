1/6/2022,"And here, as they used to say on TV game shows – as that tumble dryer, that golden fondue set, drifts off down the conveyor belt – is the Test cricket you might have had. Four distinct but interconnected things happened overnight as England and Australia played out the opening rain-addled day of the fourth Ashes Test in Sydney. First, England and Australia played out the opening rain-addled day at the SCG, where Joe Root’s team produced their most sustained performance of the southern summer.  This should come as no surprise. An Ashes series usually starts on the back of three forgettable warm-up games against motivated, high-calibre opponents. Well, we’ve had those now. History will remember them as the live elements of the 2021-21 Ashes series. In Sydney England finally got to work without the extra handicap – beyond cunning-plan selections and a seriously poor batting lineup – of culture shock and rustiness. It felt like something resembling a contest. Meanwhile, in the same timeline, the second thing was happening. The comically self-serving words of Ashley Giles, the England and Wales Cricket Board’s managing director (no, me neither) of cricket, will continue to echo around the place once this tour is done. Giles has largely been a mute figure through England’s collapse on his watch as a Test team. He broke his silence on Tuesday to make a startling pronouncement. There is, according to Ashley Giles, no point in sacking Ashley Giles – because you’ll only end up with someone like Ashley Giles. It is almost tempting to leap up and applaud this fantastical piece of non-think, to assume Giles intended this statement as a devastating satire on the spin and blame-avoidance of the ECB. But it seems Giles, who has had three years of constant oversight as England’s MD, really does seem to believe he’s just another vicim of this pesky system. This is the same pesky system that led to the disintegration of the England men’s pathway (overseer: Ashley Giles), too much power in the hands of an outgunned head coach (decided by: Ashley Giles), and the consequent disastrously planned and executed Ashes tour. This, according to Ashley Giles, believer in fate, wyrd, destiny, was all simply preordained. And yet before we become too depressed by the sound of lifeboat hunting, things three and four were also happening. At Mount Maunganui, overnight, Bangladesh produced one of the great moments in modern cricket history. Led by the wonderful Ebadot Hossain, a bolter from the wider sporting superstructure, and glued together by a fine captain and coach, Bangladesh beat the world Test champions New Zealand on their home turf, dishing up an exhilarating spectacle of team chemistry and expert planning. It seems nobody told Ebadot, or the millions cheered through lockdown in Bangladesh, about the death of red-ball cricket, systemic decline and all the rest. Maybe someone from the ECB could have a word. Meanwhile at the Wanderers, South Africa continued to sustain a gripping, well-matched Test series against India. This is the same South Africa that continue to struggle with culture-scale issues that make English cricket’s whinging about short attention spans and so on look a little deranged. And the same India that is, in English cricket’s playbook, Test cricket’s nemesis, the IPL vandals, but who continue to produce the standard of on-field excellence, and to commit to the format in its year-round scheduling. The message from Sydney and related points is clear enough. The product is, even now, resilient. This thing has always stunk of death, has always been the object of dire predictions (it’s called the Ashes for a reason). But it is possible with competence and good intentions to preserve Test cricket. Even – imagine that – to promote it. England’s players also did their bit on day one. They bowled well, which they have throughout the series, and caught well, which they haven’t. Much attention will focus on Stuart Broad taking the wicket of David Warner, but the idea Broad’s misuse in this series is some kind of overlooked silver bullet is also misguided. England lost the Ashes because of their batting. To date, only two players have passed 50. Broad himself has already played in a 5-0 and a 4-0 defeat and has 13 wickets at 39 over the past year. He should have played in Brisbane and Melbourne. But this is one small strand in a wider bodge. In Sydney it was Anderson who provided the illumination on a blue-green day. He came back late on, pitched the ball up and got Marcus Harris to edge to slip. Aged 39, Anderson is taking his wickets at 15 and going at 1.6 runs per over in the series. He remains a sporting marvel, but also a one-man reminder that so much in Test cricket turns on small virtues of craft and planning. Cricketing lore states that you should never judge a pitch until England have had a chance to collapse in a heap on it. But the next few days in Sydney could yet provide a belated show of resistance to that sense of managed decline.",Sport/Sport,Welcome back to Test cricket – there’s much life in the grand old game | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/05/welcome-back-to-test-cricket-theres-much-life-in-the-grand-old-game
1/6/2022,"The threat to American democracy may be greater today than when the insurrectionist mob swept into the US Capitol one year ago, attempting to prevent the peaceful transfer of power following a free and fair election. Joe Biden is ensconced in the White House and with the passage of time, the shock of their lethal assault has faded. But if the danger appears less immediate, addressing it is no less urgent. We know more than we did a year ago about the full violence and menace of the riot, and about what preceded it – including the PowerPoint presentation turned over by Donald Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows, detailing ways to stage a coup. Rioters have been jailed, but so far no case has been brought against those who encouraged and incited them. Mr Trump himself has resurged, with a cult-like grip upon his party. He and his allies have longer to plan for this year’s midterms and 2024. State legislatures are constructing an election-stealing machine. In short: 6 January was not an end, but a beginning.  Listen to the warnings from America’s political scientists. One says that the US is “closer to civil war than any of us would like to believe”. Another warns that the insurrectionists of 6 January are not part of a fringe: he sees a new mass political movement with violence at its core. Others foresee a slide to Hungarian-style competitive authoritarianism in which the trappings of elections remain, but so rigged that Democrats cannot win. Faced with an electorate that has rejected them, the Republicans have already entrenched their advantage in the electoral college, Senate and supreme court. Yet it is Republicans who claim that the system is cheating them. A vast swathe of the population is now detached from both political reality and political ideals – believing the 2020 election stolen, and believing that force is an acceptable response. “Alternative facts” have become mainstream belief: according to a recent poll, 68% of Americans think there is no evidence of widespread electoral fraud in 2020 – but 62% of Republicans disagree. While 60% of Americans think Mr Trump bears either a “great deal” or a “good amount” of responsibility for the storming of the Capitol, 72% of Republicans say he bears “just some” or “none at all”. Another survey found that 9% of Americans believed that “use of force is justified to restore Donald J Trump to the presidency”. It is hard to know where one might begin to tackle the sprawling rightwing disinformation ecosystem. The aspiration to a policy response to the political chasm – the Build Back Better Act – has been killed by Republican opposition, with the aid of conservative Democrat Joe Manchin. He and fellow Democratic senator Kyrsten Sinema will also tank the fresh push on voting rights if they remain opposed to amending the filibuster. Meanwhile, Republicans who attempted to rein Mr Trump in on 6 January, or publicly criticised him afterwards, have long since fallen back into line. In 12 short months they have rewritten history. Their hostility to the select committee investigation, rushing to report before November’s midterms lest it be closed down afterwards, is another attempt to silence the truth. Last year’s tidal wave of voting restrictions at state level continues, and election sabotage is gaining ground, with Republicans giving legislatures control over vote counts and replacing nonpartisan officials with Trumpists. Against these are ranged the steady, committed efforts of activists, politicians and ordinary voters to defend their rights and protect their democratic institutions. More political violence is likely in future, not least because the GOP elite have helped to legitimise it. Senior Republicans have not merely made their peace with Mr Trump and his tactics, but embraced them. Next time, such efforts might gain support from within the services. Yet the deeper threat may be that force will not be required. The dismantling of American democracy could be bloodless: quieter, more sophisticated, more cynical – and nonetheless devastating for it.",Opinion/Opinion,"The Guardian view on Trump’s mob, a year on: threats to democracy grow",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/05/the-guardian-view-on-trumps-mob-a-year-on-threats-to-democracy-grow
1/6/2022,"The story of how Elizabeth Holmes came to defraud some of the richest and most powerful investors in the US, only to end up this week facing decades in prison, is so epic and outlandish that it is no wonder it has already flowered into a prize-winning book and a popular podcast, and is reportedly on its way to becoming a Hollywood film, with Ms Holmes to be played by Jennifer Lawrence, no less. But it is more than superb entertainment; it is a parable about how our financial system is badly broken. At only 19, Ms Holmes decided to reinvent a fundamental part of healthcare: blood testing. No more painful pinpricks, nor anxious waits for results. She dropped out of Stanford to start Theranos in 2003, and in short order pulled in some of the biggest investors in Silicon Valley, garnered adoring magazine profiles and turned her startup into a firm employing 800 staff and valued at £6.6bn.  There was just one problem: the miracle technology was junk. It did not do what it said on the tin. The deception was first exposed in 2015, the company dissolved in 2018 and last August its founder began a four-month long trial. A jury found her guilty this week of four counts of fraud, each carrying a maximum term of 20 years. Ms Holmes is still only 37. When the going was good, she could count among her backers and board members powerbrokers such as Henry Kissinger and George Shultz. The trial revealed how far networking of contacts served to beguile the supposed smart money, who asked few questions but were satisfied instead with a great backstory and the lustre of the names. Investors gave Ms Holmes their millions and sent notes thanking her for taking them. Not far behind were the profile writers. Far from a few suckers getting duped, this was a political-financial-media elite disastrously short on self-doubt. As with Jeffrey Epstein, it required dogged journalism to do the serious investigation and expose the truth. Yet when the Wall Street Journal’s John Carreyrou did ask the necessary questions, Ms Holmes admitted in court that she retaliated by going straight to the newspaper’s owner, Rupert Murdoch – who just happened to be a serious investor in Theranos. The WSJ ran the stories anyway, but another organ under different ownership might not have done. Finally, America and other rich countries have spent years running record-low interest rates and quantitative easing programmes, which have pushed the cost of capital close to zero. This has not sparked a wave of innovation in socially vital technologies, but pumped more air into asset bubbles. And in the case of Theranos, all it has done is provide the kindling for a bonfire of wealth – money that could have been spent more wisely, invested more usefully and done some actual good.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Elizabeth Holmes: fake it to make it until you break it | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/05/the-guardian-view-on-elizabeth-holmes-fake-it-to-make-it-until-you-break-it
1/6/2022,"Border Force officials could strike over Priti Patel’s “morally reprehensible” plans to turn back dinghies in the Channel, a union has said. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), which represents the vast majority of Border Force staff who would implement the “pushbacks”, has joined forces with the refugee charity Care4Calais to seek a judicial review of the policy, a tactic campaigners warn could put lives at risk.  Channel crossings have become one of the most politicised issues in British politics, with the home secretary, Priti Patel, staking her reputation on making the route “unviable”. A total of 28,300 people crossed the Dover Strait aboard small boats in 2021, triple the number for 2020, according to figures compiled by the PA news agency. Patel’s controversial borders bill intends to reduce such numbers and contained, until recently, proposals that appeared to criminalise organisations such as the RNLI for rescuing asylum seekers in the Channel. The PCS and Care4Calais intend to challenge the lawfulness of redirecting boats out of UK waters and back to France. The union said the policy “contravenes international law and is morally reprehensible”, and could expose Border Force officials to risk of prosecution.Even if the court application is unsuccessful, the union has not ruled out industrial action and officials refusing to carry out the pushbacks. The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: “The legality of the pushbacks policy is in serious question, and it is right that the court decides whether it is unlawful to turn back Channel boats. “We cannot have a situation where our members could be open to potential civil and criminal action for implementing a policy that they do not agree with and know is not safe. “Although we are hoping for a positive outcome from the legal proceedings, people should be in no doubt PCS strongly opposes this policy, on moral and humanitarian grounds, and we will not rule out industrial action to prevent it being carried out.” Clare Moseley, founder of the refugee charity Care4Calais, said: “The proposed policy deprioritises the UK’s duty under domestic and international law to save lives at sea. It is for good reason that this duty is a cornerstone of International maritime law. If eroded, I fear it will enable the UK to devalue lives at sea. “It risks opening the gates to the horrific scenes we are seeing in the Mediterranean,” she added. A Home Office spokesperson said: “As part of our ongoing operational response and to prevent further loss of life at sea, we continue to test a range of safe and legal options to stop small boats making this dangerous and unnecessary journey. “These all comply and are delivered in accordance with both domestic and international law. Our New Plan for Immigration will also overhaul the broken asylum system and reduce many of the historic pull factors.” Despite the home secretary’s pledge to make crossings an “infrequent phenomenon” by spring 2020, more than 36,000 people have succeeded in reaching the UK in the last two years. The government continues to consider various options to tackle the issue and has invited businesses to a non-disclosure, agreement-bound meeting in the hope of hearing “innovative ideas”.",News/UK news,UK Border Force could strike over Channel pushback plan,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/05/uk-border-force-could-strike-over-channel-pushback-plan
1/6/2022,"It’s choose-your-poison time for a government that must know that allowing low-income households to suffer the full blast of the scheduled rise in energy bills in April is a political non-starter. After six months of high gas prices in the wholesale market, the regulator Ofgem’s price-setting formula is likely to spit out a figure close to £2,000 on average for an annual dual-fuel bill, or a year-on-year increase of roughly £700. That is simply unaffordable for many. And the implied £20bn-ish hit to discretionary consumer spending will do little to encourage a whoosh of post-Omicron activity the Treasury is relying upon in other areas of the economy. Some form of subsidy or smoothing mechanism for bills must be found.  From where the chancellor sits, though, you can see why he may not fancy cutting VAT. It’s charged at 5% on energy bills, so even a temporary removal would only reduce a £2,000 bill by £100. Nor would it be targeted: all bill-payers would benefit. On that score, Boris Johnson is correct to describe it as “a blunt instrument”. Rishi Sunak’s real worry, though, may be whether an intended temporary measure could become semi-permanent. The Treasury, remember, is trusting that VAT receipts from electricity will rise over time as fuel duties from petrol and diesel decline when we plug in our electric cars. It needs VAT to be seen as fixed. A windfall tax on North Sea gas producers? That will be tempting, but the design would be key. Some of the producers who are enjoying current conditions are also hooked into government-backed carbon capture projects, so a windfall tax risks complaints about jeopardising long-term incentives and investment. Should nuclear generators, or energy trading firms, also be included since they are also beneficiaries of high wholesale prices? Determining who should pay, and defining a “windfall” profit while wholesale prices are still volatile, can quickly become a messy business. Back in 1997, the beauty of then-chancellor Gordon Brown’s windfall tax on privatised utilities was its simplicity: it was levied on the grounds that the companies had been sold off too cheaply, which was almost unarguable. Definitions were clear and boardroom grumbling could be ignored. Boosting the size and availability of the warm homes discount available to vulnerable households is a far simpler idea. There is at least an established mechanism for payments and the benefits, unlike with a VAT removal, would be targeted. How much would it cost to make a meaningful difference? A case can be made for any number as high as £10bn, which would upset the Treasury’s spending arithmetic for next financial year. And, again, Sunak may fret about an exit given that analysts expect next autumn’s price cap to be set even higher than April’s. Thus you can see the political temptation to grant a £20bn multi-year loan to energy supply companies to make them manage the headache. The government would avoid the appearance of setting energy bills and consumers would pay over time. It’s hardly a pain-free or risk-free option, however. It means telling consumers their bills won’t fall even when wholesale prices do. And underwriting loans to a sector where two dozen companies have gone bust in the last three months would be a brave move. The government has already nationalised Bulb and probably doesn’t want to add to its collection of failed suppliers. It’s hard to predict where ministers will land among this range of unattractive choices, but a massively expanded warm homes scheme gets the vote here. It would be targeted, which is an essential requirement, and would confront the problem head-on instead of putting the bill on the never-never. The hardest part would be expanding the definition of “vulnerable” consumers: the whole point about a £700 hike to the default tariff is that newly vulnerable households will be created, which is the penny that is dropping only belatedly among ministers. Meetings with supply companies, as on Wednesday, don’t change the basic fact that a political choice has to be made about how much money to throw at easing the price shock. Doing nothing is not plausible. Ofgem sets the price cap in early February and any support scheme for low-income households needs to be announced simultaneously. Ministers need to hurry up.",News/Business,Protecting vulnerable from £700 hike in energy bills means hard choices now | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/05/protecting-vulnerable-from-700-hike-in-energy-bills-means-hard-choices-now
1/6/2022,"Prosecutors in Ghislaine Maxwell’s sex-trafficking trial on Wednesday asked the judge for an “inquiry” into a juror who said in recent post-trial media interviews that he was a victim of sexual abuse. Maxwell was found guilty on 29 December of five counts for facilitating the late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of girls, some as young as 14.  “While the court instructed jurors that they were free to discuss their jury service with anyone of their choosing, some of the statements, as related in the media, merit attention by the court. In particular, the juror has described being a victim of sexual abuse,” prosecutors wrote. “Assuming the accuracy of the reporting, the juror asserted that he ‘flew through’ the prospective juror questionnaire and does not recall being asked whether he had been a victim of sexual abuse, but stated that ‘he would have answered honestly’. “Based on the foregoing, the government believes the court should conduct an inquiry,” they wrote. The juror’s claim that he did not recall being asked about sexual abuse has spurred questions, given that prospective jurors were given a questionnaire which directly asked them this topic. One inquiry on the questionnaire stated: “Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” Another asked: “Witnesses in this case may testify claiming sexual abuse or sexual assault. Would you have any difficulty assessing the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like you would any other witness?” Maxwell’s attorneys did not to respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment on the juror’s interviews.

1/6/2022,"BMW has unveiled a chameleon car that changes colour, in the latest attempt by automotive firms to combine their vehicles with cutting-edge technology. The German car firm said it was “bringing the car body to life” with the specially developed body wrap for its all-electric iX SUV model, which uses the same technology as Amazon’s Kindle e-reader.  At the touch of a button, a driver can change the shade of the car’s exterior, allowing the colour to shift between black and white or even light and dark stripes by activating electronic ink in the wraparound shell. “You decide what you want to wear, what your social media status is – and you can decide what your car looks like,” said Stella Clarke, BMW’s project lead on the vehicle. Clarke added that the technology could be used to locate the car by making it flash when the driver is looking for it, or to display the vehicle’s battery capacity externally. According to BMW, the effect is created by applying an electrical charge to microcapsules – which contain particles of white and black pigments – suspended within a liquid encased in the wrap. The colour alternates depending on whether a negative or positive charge is applied, causing either the white or the black pigments to collect at the surface of the microcapsule. The concept car, which is not available for public sale, was unveiled at the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, where automotive firms increasingly advertise their products alongside mobile phone, gadget and TV screen makers. The agricultural machinery firm John Deere has unveiled a smartphone-controlled autonomous tractor at CES this week, while Sony revealed plans to start an electric car company and Mercedes-Benz revealed a concept electric car with a range of 1,000km – almost double the distance of a Tesla Model S. Apple, which does not exhibit at CES, has been working on a self-driving electric car that, according to a recent report, could be launched in 2025. New products shown by consumer electronics firms at CES this week include a portable Smart TV projector by Samsung, an autonomous home on wheels from LG and the official name for Sony’s new virtual reality headset, which will be called PlayStationVR2. Many of the product announcements have been made virtually after regular attenders such as Google, Microsoft, Intel and the Facebook owner Meta pulled out of physical appearances due to Covid-19 fears.",News/Business,BMW unveils car that changes colour at touch of a button,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/05/bmw-unveils-car-that-changes-colour-at-the-touch-of-a-button
1/6/2022,"New Hampshire police officers were engaged in a low-speed dog-chase on a highway along the state’s border with Vermont when they discovered that a real-life Lassie was leading them to rescue two men thrown from a truck and suffering from hypothermia. The driver, Cam Laundry, 31, and his passenger, Justin Connors, 40, were found injured but alive on Monday thanks to Tinsley, Laundry’s canine companion. Another dog, Connors’ bulldog, was hit by a car and found dead on the side of the road after the accident.  Captain Tim Cohen of the Lebanon police department said Laundry’s truck appeared to have fallen from the embankment into the woods “in such a way that it would not normally have been seen by a passing motorist”. “It’s pretty incredible that we were able to help these men, not even knowing that they were there to begin with. It was a good stroke of luck,” Cohen said. “The dog definitely played a large part in this because it drew our attention to that area.” The two friends were heading back home from dinner before the car accident. Laundry was not wearing a seatbelt and was charged with driving under the influence. He called the incident “a wake-up call”. “I couldn’t believe the amount of intelligence she had to know that we were in distress and kind of do a Lassie-thing and go get help,” Laundry told the Guardian. “I’m still trying to recollect everything that happened. She’s a little guardian angel.” It was onlookers from the road that first alerted police to the loose German shepherd on a bridge. “Of course we care about the dog. We don’t want to see it get injured, but it can also pose traffic hazards to motorists or pedestrians,” Cohen said. “We wanted to make sure the dog didn’t cause an accident, especially on the interstate.” “[Tinsley] wouldn’t really get near anybody,” Cohen said. After chasing the dog for five to 10 minutes back and forth between New Hampshire and Vermont on the Veterans Memorial bridge, police followed Tinsley to a gap in the road’s guardrail near the intersection of interstate of 89 and 91, later revealed to be the scene of Laundry’s crash. Emergency services were immediately called. The Lebanon police chief, Phillip Roberts, said he had seen this behavior from police-trained dogs before, but never from a household pet. Laundry is back home now and Connors is recovering from leg and neck surgeries in hospital. “I want my friend Justin to get better as soon as possible. Things could’ve been a lot worse than they were,” Laundry said. “We’re very fortunate to be here today because of my dog, Tinsley.”",News/US news,Dog saves day as ‘real-life Lassie’ leads rescuers to injured men after accident,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/real-life-lassie-dog-rescue-new-hampshire
1/6/2022,"Two entrepreneurs with no apparent background in healthcare have made £20m – and could make tens of millions more – after landing roles as middlemen between the UK government and a US firm that won £3.7bn of contracts to supply lateral flow tests. Charles Palmer, whose background is in property, and Kim Thonger, a former shoe retailer, are the co-owners of Disruptive Nanotechnology, a business that had just £85 in the bank and debts of £3,592 at the end of 2019.  Accounts filed at Companies House last month show that the firm’s net assets soared to £20.5m during the year to 31 December 2020, including the first nine months of the coronavirus pandemic. Disruptive Nanotechnology, trading as Tried&Tested, describes itself as the exclusive UK and EU distributor for rapid antigen and antibody tests made by California-based Innova Medical Group. Palmer’s wife, Dr Rachel Limbrey, is the chief medical adviser at Tried&Tested, as well as working as a respiratory consultant at University Hospital Southampton. Innova has won nine contracts worth a combined £3.7bn to provide tests, thanks in part to Operation Moonshot, the plan by Boris Johnson’s former adviser Dominic Cummings to roll out mass daily testing to reduce the need for strict Covid restrictions. Innova’s chief executive, Daniel Elliott, has said that Disruptive Nanotechnology co-owner Thonger, who founded the company in 2016, “worked tirelessly” to help Innova win the first of its contracts. Elliott said UK officials were “very surprised” by the quantities Innova could supply during discussions that took place in August 2020. “I think that was the ‘A-ha!’ moment for them because they were tasked with what felt like an impossible task,” he said. “We had multiple calls within a 24-hour period. And they kept asking: can you really do this?” A leak of confidential documents in September 2020 revealed the existence of Operation Moonshot, which a briefing paper described as the “only hope” of avoiding a second national lockdown. Launching Moonshot shortly afterwards, Johnson described the plan as giving people the “freedom to mingle” and return to normal. Within weeks, Innova had its first contract, for five shipments between September and early October worth £103.6m. As that one ended, a second, much bigger contract was signed for £496m. They did not go out to tender because of the “extreme urgency” and global demand, according to the contract notice. On 18 December, a third UK contract was published with Innova for £226m. Disruptive Nanotechnology, based in Harrow, north-west London, reportedly receives “a few pennies” for each test supplied by Innova, an arrangement thought to be the reason for the £20m increase in its net assets, first reported by the Daily Mail. But this year could prove even more lucrative. The combined value of Innova’s contracts for 2020, the year in which Disruptive Nanotechnology enjoyed its increase in assets, is £978.5m. Innova has won more than £2.7bn of new testing contracts since then, while the company says it has also provided tests to the public sector, indicating it could be in line for an increase in assets of tens of millions of pounds this year, amid high demand due to the Omicron variant. While the UK government has embraced Innova’s lateral flow tests, regulators in the company’s domestic market, the US, have not. The US Food and Drug Administration recalled Innova’s tests last year, citing concerns about their reliability. Innova has said that the tests are effective. Neither Thonger nor Palmer, who appear to have been instrumental in securing the supply of Innova’s tests, has a background in health or medicine. Thonger worked in marketing and branding for a series of shoe companies, including Dr Martens and Dune, for more than 20 years. Palmer was a chartered surveyor who started his own property company. Thonger founded the business in 2016 but it has never published full accounts due to its tiny size. It previously marketed a technology called LightCleanse that it claimed could be used to clean bacteria and viruses in the air and on surfaces, using nanoparticles of titanium dioxide. It is unclear whether LightCleanse is still functioning but a mobile number listed on the website is no longer active. Palmer became a director of Disruptive Nanotechnology in June 2020, shortly before it began talks with the government, and took a 50% stake in the company at some point during that year. A spokesperson from Disruptive Nanotechnology said: “Disruptive Nanotechnology provides goods and services to hundreds of clients, across many sectors, including vital national infrastructure, oil and energy, education, finance, healthcare, manufacturing, events, sport, retail and media. “Our terms of business with those clients are generally commercially sensitive, therefore we do not comment, except to say it is certain that the Guardian staff and readers benefit at some point during their day from those clients being open and active. “Partly due to our efforts, LFTs [lateral flow tests] have been widely available in the UK since September 2020. We know, and are proud, that lives and livelihoods have been saved as a result.” The Guardian has approached Thonger and Palmer for comment.",News/Business,UK firm goes from debt to £20m thanks to lucrative Covid test deals,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/05/uk-firm-goes-from-debt-to-205m-thanks-to-lucrative-covid-test-deals
