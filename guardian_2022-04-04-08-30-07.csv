4/4/2022,"Britain’s top union leader has written to the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, to warn the government that dropping plans to legislate for tougher employment rights after mass sackings at P&O Ferries would “side with bad bosses”. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the UK needed urgent “proper legislation” through an employment bill promised by ministers more than two years ago but repeatedly delayed. It emerged over the weekend that the government would leave the long-awaited reforms out of the Queen’s speech in May, when the government lays out its plans for the coming parliamentary session. It first promised an employment bill in December 2019 after Boris Johnson’s general election victory, claimed as a way to improve UK workers’ rights after Brexit. O’Grady said a failure to bring forward the plan would give a “green light to rogue employers to treat staff like disposable labour”, particularly after critics said P&O Ferries had exposed the government’s weak position to tackle abuses. The Dubai-owned ferry operator provoked outrage across the political spectrum last month by sacking nearly 800 workers without the consultations required by law, and then admitting that it had done so deliberately. The firm is facing criminal and civil investigations. “There is no excuse for delay,” said O’Grady. “If the government breaks its promise to enhance workers’ rights, working people will have been conned and betrayed. “Without new laws to protect people at work there is nothing stopping P&O-type scandals from happening again in the future.” Officials in the Cabinet Office have stopped working on the bill, meaning it is unlikely to make the speech, the Financial Times reported last week, citing three unnamed officials. A government source said the contents of the Queen’s speech had not yet been agreed upon. The bill would have introduced protections against pregnancy discrimination, and the creation of a single enforcement body for employment rights to ensure that abuses do not fall in the gaps between different regulators, as well making the right to flexible working patterns the default option unless employers have a good reason not to. A government spokesman said: “We are committed to building a high-skilled, high-productivity, high-wage economy that delivers on our ambition to make the UK the best place in the world to work. “This includes ensuring workers’ rights are robustly protected while also fostering a dynamic and flexible labour market.”",News/Politics,"Delaying new law ‘gives green light to rogue employers’, says TUC",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/04/delaying-new-law-gives-green-light-to-rogue-employers-says-tuc
4/4/2022,"More than one in four bus services in England have been cut in the last decade, with the pandemic accelerating the decline, a transport charity has found. Almost 5,000 routes have been axed since 2012, with the north-west and east of England the two regions worst affected. Research by the Campaign for Better Transport showed that 27% of bus services, measured by mileage, have disappeared in a decade, while the number of services on official registers in England dropped from almost 17,000 in March 2012 to just over 12,000 last March. The sharpest drop in bus miles came during the pandemic, falling 18%, compared with a 10% decline in the years to 2019. The charity called for a national, government-led campaign to encourage people back on board routes across the country, while urging ministers to prioritise investment in buses and cutting fares instead of cuts to fuel duty for motorists. Paul Tuohy, the chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: “Buses are relied upon by millions of people and should play a central role in a green transport future, but they have been struggling for some time, and the pandemic has made things much worse.” “Last week’s spring statement included a tax break for car drivers with a 5p cut in fuel duty, but nothing for public transport users, despite fares having risen at a far higher rate than fuel.” The charity highlighted moves in other countries to incentivise public transport use after Covid lockdowns had ended. Germany and New Zealand have both cut fares, while Wales last week launched a campaign including fare deals to get passengers back on board. Fares in England for buses – like trains – have risen far above the growth in average pay for workers over the last decade, as well as outstripping the price rises in fuel, even after the recent surge at the pumps. According to the RAC Foundation, bus and coach fares rose 58% in the last decade, while petrol went up 19%. Plans from the government to reverse the decline in buses have faltered during the pandemic. Shortly before the first lockdown, the government announced its intention to publish a national strategy with £3bn of additional funding. The strategy, Bus Back Better, was published in 2021 but much of the money has gone in emergency funding for operators after passengers were told to avoid unnecessary travel. Fears that the networks could be slashed further when Covid emergency funding ended in April were averted temporarily, with the announcement of a further £150m support from the Department for Transport last month. However, ministers have made clear the funding will expire in October 2022, encouraging services to then be adapted to meet demand, which is about 80% of pre-pandemic levels. The Urban Transport Group, which represents regional cities with major bus networks, called on the government to “use the next six months to put in place a long-term, enhanced and devolved approach to funding bus services” of the kind outlined in its strategy. It also urged the government to campaign for people to return to buses, after warning them to stay off public transport due to Covid.",News/Politics,Quarter of bus routes axed in England in last decade,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/04/quarter-of-bus-routes-axed-in-england-in-last-decade
4/4/2022,"More than 3,000 workers at 60 companies across Britain will trial a four-day working week, in what is thought to be the biggest pilot scheme to take place anywhere in the world. Employees from a wide range of businesses and charities are expected to take part in the scheme, which will run initially from June to December, including the Royal Society of Biology, the London-based brewing company Pressure Drop, a Manchester-based medical devices firm, and a fish and chip shop in Norfolk. It comes as the push for companies to adopt a shorter working week – crucially with no loss of pay while aiming for higher productivity – gains momentum as a way of improving working conditions. The pilot is being run by academics at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, as well as Boston College in the US, in partnership with the campaign group 4 Day Week Global, the 4 Day Week UK Campaign and the Autonomy thinktank. Launching the trial to examine how such employment patterns might work at a broad range of companies across the economy, the participation of 3,000 workers means it is larger than a previous pilot in Iceland by Reykjavík city council and the national government that included more than 2,500 workers. The research comes after the Covid pandemic led many people and companies to re-examine their working patterns, with a marked rise in hybrid and flexible practices that eschew the standard nine-to-five, five-day work week. Joe O’Connor, the chief executive of 4 Day Week Global, said there was no way to “turn the clock back” to the pre-pandemic world. “Increasingly, managers and executives are embracing a new model of work which focuses on quality of outputs, not quantity of hours,” he said. “Workers have emerged from the pandemic with different expectations around what constitutes a healthy life-work balance.” Other companies to have tried the four-day week who are not part of the latest trial include the FTSE 100 consumer goods firm Unilever, the Japanese electronics firm Panasonic, and London’s app-based Atom Bank. Mark Downs, the chief executive of the Royal Society of Biology, said the decision to trial the four-day week was partly a response to an “incredibly competitive” labour market. “It’s about trying to do more to be a good, innovative employer to attract and retain our current staff,” he said. “These sorts of possibilities make a massive difference. It’s great for everybody.” The society’s 35 staff mostly work in King’s Cross, London, but some have moved to remote working during the pandemic. Employees were told about the trial last week and responses so far have been universally positive, Downs said. The society will remain open five days a week, but with workers generally split between Monday-to-Thursday and Tuesday-to-Friday shifts.",News/Business,Thousands of UK workers to take part in four-day week trial ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/04/thousands-of-uk-workers-to-take-part-in-four-day-week-trial
