2/22/2022,"By Marc Jones LONDON (Reuters) - Investors were bracing for a torrid day for Russian, Ukrainian and wider global markets when they reopen on Tuesday, after Vladimir Putin upped the ante in a crisis the West fears could unleash a major war. In a lengthy televised address, the Russian president recognised two breakaway regions Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine as independent entities and described Ukraine as an integral part of Russia's history. Tensions have already rattled global markets this year and wiped tens of billions of dollars off the value of Russian and Ukraine assets, but Monday's escalation is expected to cause much worse. ""It is probably an understatement to say that it will be an ugly day (on the markets) tomorrow,"" said Viktor Szabo, an emerging market portfolio manager at abrdn in London. ""I was hoping we weren't going to get here, but this is a significant step."" Russian markets were still open when Putin announced his decision live on television following phone calls to the leaders of Germany and France. The rouble losses reached 3.3%, while Moscow's stock markets plunged to their lowest level in over a year as the dollar-denominated RTS index finished the day 13.2% lower and the rouble-based MOEX Russian index lost 10.5%. Analysts at Commonwealth Bank of Australia warned traders ahead of the start of Tuesday's Asian open that Putin's decision to recognise the separatist-held areas of Ukraine would clearly exacerbate already high tensions ""Financial market participants now wait for a response from the United States and Europe,"" they added. That response is expected to come in the shape of tough new sanctions. Although other steps might come first, some of the most severe measures would be to cut Russia's banks off from the SWIFT banking system and order a complete ban on EU, UK and U.S. investment funds holding Russian government bonds. At the end of last year foreigners held just over $43 billion of OFZs, as Russia's rouble-denominated bonds are known. ""We agreed (Britain) and (the EU) will coordinate to deliver swift sanctions against Putin’s regime, and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine,"" British Foreign Minister Liz Truss said on Twitter following a call with European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. GRAPHIC: Russia Ukraine CDS - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klvykmxlqvg/Pasted%20image%201645485094587.png FUTURES SLUMP Yields on Russia's 10-year OFZs were expected to surge further having hit a high of 10.6% on Monday. Russia has one of the biggest stockpiles of international FX reserves in the world at $630 billion, but the cost of insuring its sovereign debt against default has also soared to its highest since early 2016. Analysts were also warning of the wider impact on global market confidence, which along with the pressures of fast-rising global borrowing costs this year, has already been hit by the tensions. Futures markets were pointing to a 1.8% fall on the S&P 500 on Wall Street later, a 2.2% drop on Japan's Nikkei, a 2.5% drop on the Nasdaq and 3.7% slump on Germany's DAX in Europe. Demand for traditional safe assets also saw U.S. Treasuries rally. ""This step clearly increases uncertainty and thus creates further downside risk for global risk assets,"" said Manik Narain, head of emerging market strategy at UBS. ""We are going to see a negative reaction,"" added Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors in Florida. ""We are going to test the Jan. 24 lows which was 4,220 on the S&P 500"".

The benchmark MOEX Russia Index slumped as much as 14pc, while the dollar-denominated RTS Index slid 17pc, notching up the biggest decline since 2008. Russian stocks tumbled across the board, though state-owned energy giant Gazprom and financial services group Sberbank were among the biggest fallers. It came as Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was considering an appeal for official recognition from separatists in east Ukraine in a move that would further escalate the crisis. The negative sentiment hit stocks across the globe, with the FTSE 100 sliding into the red after a strong start to the day. Wall Street was closed for a public holiday, further adding to volatility. We are now closing the blog, we shall see you tomorrow morning at the same time, same place. Meanwhile, have a look at some of the latest business stories: Germany slumps into second recession, says Bundesbank Drivers face fuel shortages as workers at UK's largest refinery vote on strike action British regulator wades into Sir Nick Clegg’s battle with Google New taxes rake in £50bn for HMRC ahead of National Insurance rise Billionaire investor launches battle against McDonald's treatment of pigs More than 80pc has been wiped off the value of Southampton University spin-out company Synairgen, after trial data showed its Covid-19 treatment failed to cure people quicker. Hannah Boland writes: The company's share price plunged to its lowest level in almost two years, as it released late-stage findings from trials showing that those who had received the treatment were no more likely to be discharged from hospital than those who received a placebo, and were no more likely to recover quicker. It marks a major setback for Synairgen, which last April had been buoyed by earlier trial data which suggested Covid patients treated with the inhalable treatment were twice as likely to recover from a severe case which hit their lungs. The results had sent shares up by more than 1,300pc. UK trade unions have challenged Boris Johnson’s move to end Covid regulations in England, saying the prime minister should put public health first. The Trades Union Congress, an umbrella group for British unions representing more than 5.5m people, said the government should first commit to improving sick pay and supporting people with weakened immune systems and long Covid. The group warned that introducing charges for Covid tests at a time of rising consumer prices would be “an act of madness.” “We are all looking forward to getting on with our lives,” TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said. “But the prime minister must put the country and public health first.” Has the government learnt nothing from this pandemic?Scrapping day one access to sick pay, and ending free tests, is taking a sledgehammer to public health.Low-income and frontline workers will be hit hardest. It’s just plain wrong! — Frances O'Grady (@FrancesOGrady) February 21, 2022 The FTSE 100 has shed its early gains as tensions in Ukraine are keeping global markets on edge despite attempts to defuse the crisis. London's leading index fell 0.4pc to 7,484. ""European markets have continued to be susceptible to headline risk today and are likely to remain so for some time to come,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. ""Today’s price action is a perfect example of how a single headline can turn sentiment on its head."" Boris Johnson has confirmed coronavirus rules will end in England, the first major Western economy to scrap government restrictions relating to the pandemic. From Thursday, people who have the virus will no longer be legally required to self-isolate, though they will still be advised to stay at home. From April 1, the universal and free availability of coronavirus testing will end. Johnson’s announcement of the government’s “Living with Covid” plan comes against a backdrop of declining daily infections, hospitalisations and deaths relating to the disease, though critics say he is moving too fast. Britain’s leader is also still fighting for his political future amid an ongoing police investigation into alleged rule-breaking parties in Downing Street, and easing the virus rules has been a key demand of the backbenchers upon whom his premiership depends. 🔴 Prime Minister Boris Johnson @10DowningStreet is making a statement on Covid-19.Watch live ⬇️ https://t.co/0jm1xc6uvb — UK House of Commons (@HouseofCommons) February 21, 2022 Ofgem has appointed Yu Energy to take over customers from two energy suppliers that collapsed last week.

""We understand that this news may be unsettling for customers, however they do not need to worry.

Yu Energy will contact customers in the coming days to let them know what happens next. Customers can shop around for a better deal after they are switched over. Sterling has given up some gains but has remained in positive territory against a slightly weakening dollar on Monday while optimism about a diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukraine standoff faded, dampening risk appetite. The Kremlin said there were no concrete plans for a summit over Ukraine between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Joe Biden, after the French president said the two leaders had agreed on a meeting in principle. The pound has added 0.15pc against the dollar at $1.3608, not far off its highest level since Jan. 20 at $1.3643. “Because the markets are already very nervous due to high inflation, rising interest rates and upcoming rate hikes, the Ukraine-Russia conflict is temporarily acting as an amplifier of market movements,” said Moritz Paysen, a foreign exchange and rates analyst at Berenberg. That's all from me for today – thanks for following along! Giulia Bottaro is in charge for the rest of the day. Virgin Hyperloop is said to have made almost half its staff redundant as the company shifts its focus from passenger travel to freight. The company confirmed to the Financial Times that 111 people had been laid off on Friday in a move it said would allow it to focus on a cargo version of its concept. The hyperloop – a variant of the vacuum train – propels pods through low pressure tubes at speeds of up to 670mph. Virgin told the FT the company was ""changing direction"" due to supply chain issues and the impact of Covid. Britain has waded into a battle between Google and Facebook over privacy changes that threaten to cost the social network tens of billions of dollars and figure high on the agenda of its lobbying chief Sir Nick Clegg. James Titcomb has the details: The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it would “closely monitor” Google’s plans to block advert-tracking technology on more than 3bn Android phones. Google, which owns the Android operating system, dealt a blow to advertisers last week when it said it would restrict how they can track smartphone owners’ activity across various apps. The changes follow similar restrictions Apple has introduced on iPhones and are touted as a boost to privacy. However, Google’s plans, known as the “Android Privacy Sandbox” are likely to be closely watched because of the company's own advertising empire. Facebook, Google's biggest rival for online advertising spending, is expected to suffer a $10bn (£7.4bn) blow to sales from Apple’s changes this year. Wall Street fears over the impact were partly responsible for a record-breaking 26pc drop in the share price of Facebook’s parent company Meta in a single session this month. The CMA’s intervention is expected to lead to intense lobbying from Meta over Google's similar plans. The main political grouping in the European Parliament has called for a review of Switzerland's banking practices and its potential inclusion on the EU's dirty-money blacklist following leaks of Credit Suisse documents. Media organisations published findings from a leak of accounts belonging to 30,000 of the bank’s clients, totalling £80bn, that detailed funds controlled by corrupt businessmen and politicians. The European People's Party, the conservative grouping that holds the largest number of seats in the European Parliament, called on the EU Commission to ""re-evaluate Switzerland as high-risk money-laundering country"". The EU list currently comprises 21 countries who are deemed to have shortfalls in their rules and practices against money laundering. Among them are Iran, Myanmar, Syria and North Korea. No European country is on the list. Credit Suisse said it strongly rejects the allegations about its business practices, arguing that some accounts referenced by the leaks dated back to the 1940s. The UK is providing a $100m (£73m) credit facility to First Bank of Nigeria to help support women-owned businesses and small companies in the country. CDC Group, the UK's development-finance organisation, said the funding will ""address the challenge of limited access to capital faced by under-banked and underserved groups in the country"". A minimum of $30m will be allocated in the form of credit lines to women entrepreneurs. The facility will use First Bank's 700 branches and 150,000 banking agents in Africa's largest economy to improve credit access. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline is among the targets in a package of sanctions being prepared by the EU in case Russia invades Ukraine, Austria has confirmed. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said the sanctions would include blocking approval of the controversial energy link, which would supply from Russia to Germany. He told reporters: ""Certification [of the pipeline] would then be stopped [if Russia invaded]. There is no question about that. That therefore means that Nord Stream 2 is part of the sanctions."" Nord Stream 2 has been built but is still awaiting German and EU regulatory approval. It's faced opposition from the US and some EU member states amid concerns it will heighten reliance on Russia. Moscow has argued that the pipeline will strengthen Europe's energy security. Donald Trump's new social media app, Truth Social, is already struggling with teething problems after users complained they were unable to log in just hours after it went live. Hannah Boland reports: Truth Social, which is backed by Trump Media & Technology Group, launched on Apple's App Store late on Sunday night. However, new users reported being placed on waitlists, with the app citing ""massive demand"", and others said they were struggling to register for an account. The launch of the app is expected to see the former president make a return to social media, following the furore around the Capitol Hill riots last year which led to Mr Trump being banned from websites including Twitter and Facebook. He was accused of inciting violence which led to rioters storming the White House. The app has been in a testing phase in recent weeks, and Mr Trump's son Donald Trump Jr last week posted a screenshot of his father's first message on Truth Social, in which he wrote: ""Get Ready! Your favorite President will see you soon!"" Read Hannah's full story here The FTSE 100 has gone into reverse this afternoon, and it's Russian miners that are taking the brunt of it. The blue-chip index, which pushed higher this morning, is now down 0.7pc. Hopes of diplomacy are starting to fade amid clashes on the border with Ukraine, while Boris Johnson's spokesman warned an invasion was imminent. Anglo-Russian miner Polymetal International was the biggest FTSE 100 faller, tumbling 8.7pc as tensions rose. Evraz, which is controlled by billionaire Roman Abramovich, fell 5.6pc. The FTSE 250 suffered even more, slumping 1.4pc to an 11-month low. Petropavlovsk dropped 11pc to the bottom of the index. Water bosses whose companies dump sewage in UK rivers should have their bonuses reined in. That's according to David Black, head of regulator Ofwat, who told firms they had to ensure chief executives were not handed bonuses that ""reward poor performance"". In a letter Mr Black wrote: ""Companies' performance in some areas, most notably on the environment, risks eroding trust and confidence in the sector. ""We therefore expect companies to ensure that these outcomes are reflected in performance-related pay for executive directors, including recognition of poor performance and any non-compliance with regulatory and statutory obligations."" Last month a report from MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee found that only 14pc of rivers in England met food ecological status. It placed blame on the Government, regulators and water companies for allowing ""a Victorian sewerage system to buckle under increasing pressure"". Fuel supplies to airports and filling stations could be hit in the spring amid threats of a strike at the UK's largest oil refinery. A ballot of 100 workers at the Fawley refinery – owned by oil giant Exxon – gets underway today, with strikes set to begin in April. Members of the Unite union are threatening the action over an ""insulting"" offer of 2.5pc increases in pay over the next two years. Inflation has hit a 30-year high of 5.5pc and is set to peak above 7pc in the spring. Sharon Graham, Unite general secretary, said: The employers need to take back this insulting pay offer, which is actually a cut, and think again. Our members have mounting bills to pay like everyone else, and with runaway inflation there is no way we will accept a derisory 2.5pc for this workforce. British sports car maker Lotus is exploring options for a stock market listing as it seeks to fund a major expansion in China and its shift to electric vehicles. Geely, the Chinese company behind Lotus, last year split the firm into two parts, a Norfolk-based sports car manufacturer and a “lifestyle” brand based in China focused on making electric sports utility vehicles. It is now gearing up for a stock market listing of the lifestyle division, which could take place in the UK, US or China. The China-based unit, Lotus Tech, forms a key part of the company’s efforts to grow sales from 1,710 cars in 2021 to as many as 150,000 each year. An initial public offering for Lotus would mark the latest move into public markets for one of Geely’s investments. It is a major shareholder in Volvo, which was valued at more than $15bn in a Stockholm listing last year. Polestar, the electric car specialist spun out of Volvo, plans to list this year in a blank-cheque deal that could value it at $20bn. It's set to be a quiet afternoon of trading, with US markets closed for Presidents' Day. Closer to home, the FTSE 100 has erased its earlier gains to swing 0.2pc into the red. The blue-chip index had started the day on the front foot amid hopes of a summit between Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin, but it seems the optimism is running out of steam. AstraZeneca is one of the winners, rising 2.5pc following positive trial data for its breast cancer drug. But oil majors BP and Shell, as well mining stocks, are all dragging down shares as commodity prices swing amid geopolitical tensions. The domestically-focused FTSE 250 slumped 1.3pc. Miner Petropavlovsk, which has operations in Russia, slumped more than 10pc. Retail investor platform PrimaryBid has raised $190m (£140m) in a funding round led by Softbank's Vision Fund 2. The latest cash injection values the UK fintech, which is backed by the London Stock Exchange Group, at around $715m, Bloomberg reports. It plans to use the funding to scale up its business in continental Europe and the US. PrimaryBid has cashed in on a growing trend of opening up share sales to the public. Deliveroo, PensionBee and Soho House all offered shares to retail investors through PrimaryBid during their stock market floats. It comes after the company raised $50m in October 2020 from backers including LSEG, Molten Ventures, Fidelity, ABN Amro and Hambo Perks. New levies imposed on businesses over the last decade have raked in more than £50bn for the Treasury, as the UK’s tax burden rises to its highest level since the 1950s. Tim Wallace has more: The bank levy, apprenticeship levy, soft drinks tax and a range of other charges have all contributed to the public purse, according to analysis by Thomson Reuters. It comes as National Insurance is set to rise in April, adding 1.25 percentage points to the tax levied on employers and on their workers’ pay packets. Jas Sandhu Dade at Thomson Reuters said it is a tough time to add to the burden on taxpayers. She said: “Adding new taxes and placing a heavy burden on businesses comes at a difficult time for those still recovering from the economic impact of the pandemic. “These new taxes have proven themselves to be a successful way to bring in billions of pounds in a relatively short space of time. The new National Insurance surcharge is sure to be a success from a public purse perspective, but will add considerable financial and compliance stresses to both businesses and individuals.” Read Tim's full story here Germany may have fallen into its second recession since the outbreak of Covid as the omicron variant dragged down activity. That's according to the Bundesbank, which warned output in Europe's largest economy may decline ""noticeably"" in the first quarter, having already shrunk by 0.7pc in the final three months of the year. In its monthly report, the central bank said: “In contrast to previous waves of the pandemic, it’s not just the services sector that’s hit by restrictions and adapted behavior.” It warned pandemic-related worker absences would “markedly” hit activity in other areas too. There is some cause for optimism, though. The report, which followed upbeat PMI data for the eurozone, predicted a strong rebound in the German economy in the spring thanks to ""very good"" demand. Oil slumped and then recovered in volatile trading this morning after France said the US and Russian presidents had agreed in principle to a meeting over Ukraine. West Texas Intermediate initially fell as much as 2.7pc before recovering most of its slump, while Brent crude is now marginally higher at $93.67 a barrel. US officials said Joe Biden had agreed to meet with his Russian counterpart this week, provided the country did not attack Ukraine. The Kremlin issued a cautious response saying there were ""no concrete plans"" in place for the talks. Investors also have an eye on negotiations to rekindle Iran’s 2015 nuclear agreement. Iran this morning said there had been some progress in the talks, but warned the two sides had yet to resolve the toughest issues. Adam Hoyes, assistant economist at Capital Economics, says ""punchy"" PMI numbers give even more evidence that the economy has rebounded strongly from omicron. Perhaps unsurprisingly after suffering the most as a result of omicron, the rise in the composite measure was driven primarily by the services PMI, which rose from 54.1 in January to 60.8 in February as lower Covid-19 cases meant people returned to leisure venues. Meanwhile, the manufacturing PMI held steady at 57.3 as weaker employment growth offset a rise in the output balance. More importantly, the prices balance showed some further signs that inflationary pressures from supply disruptions are easing. The suppliers’ delivery times balance of the manufacturing PMI suggests that delivery times lengthened at their slowest pace since November 2020. That probably helped both the input and output manufacturing price balances tick down. Although admittedly the rise in the services input price balance suggests wage pressures are continuing to build. In sum, the PMIs suggest the economy shrugged off the hit from omicron. And the tentative signs of easing supply disruptions and price pressures are encouraging too. But with CPI inflation far above the Bank of England’s 2pc target and rising, we still expect Bank Rate to reach 1.25pc by the end of this year and 2pc by the end of next year. The food group behind Marry Berry cakes reported record sales in the second half of last year but warned customers would face higher prices. Finsbury Food, which also makes Weight Watchers branded cakes, posted 9pc growth in revenue to £166.5m. However, pre-tax profits dipped from £7.4m to £5.7m as costs spiralled. The London-listed company said it would be able to mitigate the impact in the coming months by passing higher costs onto consumers. Finsbury held its forecasts for the full year steady, but shares fell 2pc. Much like in the UK, economic growth in the eurozone was handed a major boost this month as virus restrictions were eased. Growth accelerated to a five-month high, according to the latest IHS Markit survey, but it also noted that persistent supply constraints and soaring energy prices also pushed inflation to a record level. Its purchase managers' index (PMI) surged 3.5 points to 55.8, higher than the 52.3 recorded in January. A figure above 50 indicates growth. The rise was attributed to the eurozone exiting two months of tough restrictions designed to slow the spread of the omicron variant. The Eurozone #PMI recovered to a 5-month high in February (55.8; Jan: 52.3), but persistent cost pressures from rising wages and energy bills led to the strongest markup of goods and services charges on record.

US President Joe Biden and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have agreed to a summit in principle, fuelling risk sentiment and shifting focus away from safe havens such as the dollar. Meanwhile, the latest PMI data showed a strong rebound in private sector activity in February as omicron jitters faded, reinforcing expectations that the Bank of England will move to raise interest rates. The pound rose 0.4pc against the dollar to $1.3636. Against the euro it fell 0.1pc to 83.39p. Simon Harvey at Monex Europe says there's something for the interest rate hawks and doves in today's PMI numbers. Today’s PMI data is unlikely to dissuade the more hawkish traders within money markets as services activity exceeded expectations by a considerable margin and manufacturing activity held up despite expectations of a minor slowdown. Despite the strong indicators sent from the services sector, the manufacturing PMI data did show some areas of weakness. Supply chain disruptions and staffing issues due to omicron persisted in February and weighed on production growth. Despite this, backlogs of work decreased at the fastest rate since June 2020 as new order growth in the manufacturing sector stalled and rising inventories helped alleviate capacity pressures. Meanwhile, cost inflation continued to moderate within the manufacturing sector, signalling a decline in core goods inflation is likely in the coming six months. The divergence in the two sectors means today’s PMI report provided something for both the more conservative and more hawkish side of the monetary policy argument and is therefore unlikely to move the pricing of a 50bps hike by the BoE in March. Private sector growth has rebounded to its strongest level in eight months as the easing of omicron fears drove consumer spending on travel, leisure and entertainment. The IHS Markit Flash Composite index stood at 60.2 in February – up from 54.2 in January and the highest since June 2021. Output growth in the service economy sharply outpaced that of the manufacturing sector, as restrictions eased and more people got back to the office. However, input cost inflation accelerated again in February and came close to breaching the survey-record high seen last November. Faster rises in operating expenses at service sector firms once again offset a slowdown in cost inflation at manufacturing companies. Looser pandemic restrictions prompted a stronger expansion in the UK with the #PMI at a 8-month high of 60.2. Output growth in the service economy exceeded that seen in the manufacturing sector, while supply chain issues showed signs of easing.

The White House has accepted French proposals for a summit on the condition that Russia doesn't invade Ukraine. The Kremlin said there were ""no concrete plans"" for talks yet. The prospect of a meeting fuelled hopes that war could be avoided. A conflict threatens to disrupt energy supplies to Europe and wreak further havoc in the market. Benchmark European prices fell as much as 6.5pc, while the UK equivalent was down 3.7pc. Grant Shapps has given Sadiq Khan another week of funding for Tube, bus and rail services across London. My colleague Oliver Gill reports: Mr Khan, chairman of Transport for London, is locked in talks with the Government to agree a fresh bailout. The latest Westminster funding originally ran out on Feb 4. It was extended for two weeks until midnight on Friday. A further extension has been granted by Mr Shapps, the Transport Secretary, on Feb 25, TfL announced this morning. TfL is facing a £1.5bn funding black hole over the next two years. This, however, is for operating expenditure rather than the money required to prevent the London Underground and other public transport falling into disrepair. The key sticking point in negotiations are a series of conditions attached to the latest bailout. Mr Khan is desperate to receive a ""long-term"" deal and has resisted calls to introduce driverless Tubes. Ministers, meanwhile, are refusing to give Mr Khan the money unless he commits to a series of reforms, including closing the Underground's final salary pension scheme. German factory inflation has surged to its fastest pace in the post-war era, fuelling expectations that producers will pass higher costs onto consumers. Producer prices jumped 25pc in January compared to last year – the sharpest growth since 1949 – according to the latest official figures. Higher energy bills were the main driver of higher prices, with energy costs up by two thirds compared to January 2021. Supply troubles have also driven up costs.

But it's good news for energy markets. Wind now accounts for 37pc of all electricity generation – a sharp increase on the average of 19.3pc over the last year. Dudley, Eunice and Franklin mean wind power has been elevated for a week now, with demand peaking at 45pc over the last 24 hours. The FTSE 100 has gained ground in early trading on hopes of a de-escalation in the crisis between Russia and Ukraine. US President Joe Biden and Russian leader Vladimir Putin have agreed in principle to a summit over Ukraine, raising hopes an invasion could be avoided. The blue-chip index gained 0.6pc, driven by miners including Evraz, Rio Tinto and Anglo American, tracking higher copper prices amid a weaker dollar as easing geopolitical tensions. Dechra Pharmaceuticals rose 1pc after beating expectations for revenue and profit in the first half of the year, while AstraZeneca was boosted by positive trials of its breast cancer drug. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson is set to outline plans to lift the remaining Covid restrictions, helping to boost sentiment and driving up travel and leisure stocks. The FTSE 250 inched marginally higher. AstraZeneca has reported positive data from a late-stage trial that shows its drug helps patients with breast cancer live longer. The pharmaceutical firm said Enhertu boosted survival rates in patients with HER2-low unresectable and metastatic breast cancer. Susan Galbraith, Astra's executive vice president of oncology research and development, said the results ""could reshape how breast cancer is classified and treated"". Shares rose as much as 2.2pc in early trading. It's a busy morning for M&A, but Clipper Logistics appears to be one of the biggest winners. The Leeds-based company surged 13pc in early trading after revealing it's agreed a takeover by US rival GXO that values it at around £943m. GXO's offer is valued at 920p per share, with 690p in cash and the rest in new GXO shares. Clipper said its board would unanimously recommend the offer to shareholders. A merger would combine two huge global supply chain management groups. Clipper handles logistics for a string of major European retailers including Asda and Argos, while GXO operates hundreds of warehouses globally. Hammerson is lining up the sale of two of its shopping centres in Leeds in what could be a £120m deal. The real estate group confirmed it's in talks with Swiss firm Redical Holding over a sale of its Victoria Gate and Victoria Quarter sites. Hammerson, which owns Birmingham's Bullring and Brent Cross, said there's no certainty a deal will be agreed. The chief executive of Made.com is stepping down for family reasons. Philippe Chainieux, who took over the top role in 2017, said he was pausing his professional activities to take care of his family. Nicola Thompson, currently chief operating officer, will join the board and assume the position of interim chief executive with immediate effect. Susanne Given, chair of Made.com, said: On behalf of the board, I would like to thank Philippe for his dedication and hard work over the last nine years, during which he and the Made team have built this exciting, unique and successful digital consumer business. In 2021 we delivered record revenues and finished the year in a strong financial position. It is with sadness and understanding that the board accepts Philippe's resignation and we wish him and his family well for the future.

Jeremy Leaf, former RICS chairman, says the housing market is continuing where it left off last year. Although Rightmove‘s figures are based on asking, rather than selling, prices, there still seems to be scope for further increases. Demand hasn’t been blown off course so far by the weather, rising interest rates or inflation as we have recorded a significant proportion of buyers who missed out in some of last year's competitive bidding returning for another try. Listings are increasing but not fast enough to satisfy appetite for houses in particular which is inevitably reducing the number of transactions. Looking forward, stretched affordability will mean prices cannot keep rising at the same pace but certainly there's no sign of any significant softening yet. Tim Bannister, director of property data at Rightmove, says many house hunters are still determined to move despite a squeeze on finances. The rising cost of living is undoubtedly affecting many people's finances, especially those trying to save up enough for a deposit to get on the ladder or to trade up. However, despite rising costs and rising interest rates, the data right now shows demand rising across the whole of Great Britain, with many people determined to move as we head into the spring home-moving season. Good morning.  After the pandemic turning the housing market on its head, we've got the first sign that things are returning to normal. Buyer enquiries for properties in London surged 24pc this month from a year earlier – the sharpest growth of any region. Asking prices also rose to a record £667,001. It's a turnaround for the capital, which had underperformed the rest of the country during the pandemic, and suggests buyers are looking for homes in commuter areas again as they get back to the office.

2/22/2022,"Along with being expected to start a rate hike cycle in March, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to stop purchasing assets to add to its $9 trillion balance sheet. And while multiple rate hikes seems to be largely factored into the stock market, winding down the balance sheet — i.e., start selling assets into the market as opposed to buying — is a less understood variable. “When... the most reliable buyer with its own printing press and an incredible willingness to buy – when they step out of the market, that is a fundamental change to the marketplace,” Mohamed El-Erian, president of Queen’s College at Cambridge University and Chief Economic Advisor at Allianz, told Yahoo Finance Live this week (video above). ""So it shouldn't come as a surprise that [stock prices] are lower, because $120 billion a month of asset purchases are disappearing."" El-Erian stressed that unwinding the balance sheet ""need not be disorderly. If you can establish and you still have strong fundamentals, people will come in and take the leg up based on something much more lasting than a liquidity regime. The concern we have is by being late, the Fed also puts economic growth in play. And that means earnings become more uncertain. So that's why this is a very delicate period. There is still a window to get this right. But unfortunately, that window is closing."" The anticipation of increased Fed hawkishness is one of the reasons behind the uptick in volatility this year, with the CBOE Volatility Index averaging more than 23 thus far in 2022 after average of just under 20 in 2021. The MOVE Index, which measures Treasury market volatility, has also seen a more dramatic surge with a 19 percentage point rise so far this year. According to Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, investors have to try to factor in the shrinking of the balance sheet – what she called “a tightening cycle that is unlike any we have seen in the past” – even if it’s uniquely challenging to do so. “Unlike in past periods, they’re not giving us a playbook,” Sonders told Yahoo Finance Live. The Fed isn’t “telling us in advance: Here’s what we’re thinking in terms of balance-sheet shrink, the amount per month. Here’s what we’re thinking in terms of rate hikes. Data dependency is what they’re emphasizing, which means we’re all living day to day in terms of what the data looks like and ultimately how the Fed has to behave."" In terms of relevant data, there are two more important inflation reads before the Fed’s next meeting on March 15 and 16: the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (commonly known as the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation) on Feb. 25; and the Consumer Price Index, due on March 10. In any case, El-Erian noted that the stakes are very high — not only in terms of market volatility and a drop in speculative asset prices (which has already been occurring), but also because of potential economic risk. ""In a perfect world, you want people to say this inflation is truly transitory,"" he explained. ""I don't need to change my behavior. But because inflation has stayed high for so long, people are changing their behavior. They're asking for compensation, higher wages, companies are raising prices."" The danger, he stressed, is when companies expect costs to continue to rise and consequently preemptively raise prices for consumers. ""The really dangerous phase is anticipatory — when you feel that to protect your purchasing power, to protect your profit margins, you need to protect against future inflation,"" El-Erian said. ""And that's what the Fed can help avoid is that inflationary expectations become a main driver of inflation."" ""We’re not there yet,"" El-Erian added, ""but if the Fed is not careful, we’ll get there.” Julie Hyman is the co-anchor of Yahoo Finance Live, weekdays 9am-11am ET.

2/22/2022,"By Alexander Marrow MOSCOW (Reuters) -The rouble tanked on Monday, slipping past 80 against the dollar, while stocks plunged to their lowest in over a year as Russian President Vladimir Putin called for the immediate recognition of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. Putin signed a decree recognising the breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent entities, upping the ante in a regional crisis the West fears could erupt into war. The rouble fell to as low as 80.0650 against the dollar during Putin's lengthy televised address to the Russian nation but pared some losses as Putin announced his decision, which he said would find support among Russian people. The sharp drop in the rouble from levels around 70 to the greenback seen just four months ago is expected to fuel already high inflation, one of the main concerns among Russians, which would dent the country's already falling living standards. By 1956 GMT, the rouble fell 2.7% to 79.37 against the dollar. It had been as strong as 76.1450 earlier in the session. Against the euro, the rouble had lost 2.6% to 89.79 after hitting 90.7850, a level last seen in April 2021. No Russian assets were left unscathed, with stocks cascading to their lowest since early November 2020 and bond yields, which move inversely to prices, soaring to their highest since January 2016. The dollar-denominated RTS index finished the day 13.2% lower at 1,207.5 points and the rouble-based MOEX Russian index lost 10.5% to 3,036.9 points. Yields on Russia's 10-year benchmark OFZ bonds hit a high of 10.64%. The cost of insuring Russia sovereign debt against default also surged to its highest since early 2016 and both Moscow and Kyiv's sovereign dollar bonds tumbled. Goldman Sachs analysts said it now seemed plausible that geopolitical risks in the Ukraine-Russia standoff were starting to have a meaningful impact on global assets. Comparing the rouble with its high-yielding emerging market peers was a good measure of the amount of risk premium still priced into the rouble, they said. ""On that basis, our latest estimates would put the risk premium from recent escalation at 9% based on Friday’s closing prices,"" Goldman Sachs said. DIPLOMACY VS. SANCTIONS The prospect of a possible summit between Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden, as well as upcoming talks between the United States and Russia's top diplomats on Feb. 24, had given investors a glimmer of hope earlier in the session. Despite Moscow's repeated denials of Western statements saying that it plans to invade neighbouring Ukraine, Russian assets have been hammered by fears of a military conflict that would almost certainly trigger sweeping new Western sanctions against Moscow. Washington has prepared an initial package of sanctions against Russia that includes barring U.S. financial institutions from processing transactions for major Russian banks, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Shares of Russia's top banks Sberbank and VTB fell 20% and 17% respectively, underperforming the wider market. Oil major Rosneft's shares also dropped 13.3%.

2/22/2022,"Volatility, and descending trends, that’s the path the markets are taking these days. While the usual headwinds are all in play, the chief worry now is coming from Eastern Europe. Will Russia invade, or won’t it? A shooting conflict, involving a superpower, taking place in one of Europe’s most agriculturally productive and mineral-rich countries, has huge potential for political and economic fallout, enough to keep pundits and market watchers awake at night. But an in-depth analysis of geopolitical events over the past several decades, by Truist Advisory, would suggest that investors may not need to worry quite so much. The firm looked at 12 major events, including the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, the Iran hostage crisis of 1979, and the Iraq War of 2003, and followed market fluctuations for a year after each event. On average, the S&P 500 gained 8.6% in the ‘post-event’ period; the index posted a one-year gain in 9 of the 12 periods examined. Truist’s co-chief investment officer, Keith Lerner, sums up this findings, saying, “When you look at the history of geopolitical events, they tend to have a short-term impact on the markets, and as long as they don’t drive you into recession, then the markets tend to rebound... The conclusion is that we don’t think investors should overreact to this situation by itself.” With all of this in mind, let’s take a look at two stocks that have shown sharp losses recently – and are still showing substantial upside, suggesting they may jump when the geopolitical situation calms down. According to the latest TipRanks data, both are Strong Buy stocks, and both show potential for triple-digit percentage gains in the coming months. Porch Group (PRCH) The first stock we're looking at is Porch Group, an online service company offering software and platforms that connect homeowners with the services they need to maintain and improve their properties. These include home improvement and warranty, contracting, moving, and home inspection. Taken together, Porch can connect customers with service providers in every segment of the $500 billion annual home improvement market. The company went public, in December of 2020, through a SPAC transaction, and the shares saw a volatile 2021 before falling sharply from their November peak into the beginning of this year. The stock is down 68% from that peak. It’s important to note, however, that even as Porch’s share price has declined the company has continued to execute on its expansionary strategy. It announced in December the addition of the newest module in its software offerings for home inspection services, the Inspection Support Network. The new module allows homebuyers and agents to pay for inspections at the home closing. In another expansion move, in January, the company’s property and casualty insurance subsidiary Homeowners of America (HOA) announced that it is introducing services in New Mexico and Montana. HOA now operates in 14 states. Porch’s expansion continues, and the company is looking forward to its 4Q21 earnings release, set for March 1. In the last release, for 3Q21, the company increased its full-year 2021 revenue guidance from $187.5 million to $195 million. Achieving the new guidance will put the company on track for 170% year-over-year revenue growth. Looking at Porch for Berenberg Bank, analyst Nate Crosset gives an upbeat take on the broad picture. “PRCH’s differentiated business model essentially gives home service providers early access to high-intent customers (i.e., new homebuyers), delivering solid growth. The company has a substantial TAM with low penetration, which we believe leaves room for growth, while continued M&A execution could increase the TAM. Lastly, we believe the Street is underappreciating PRCH’s differentiated business model and solid growth; we think PRCH deserves a higher multiple,” Crosset opined. Crosset thinks the stock has some way to go, and by some way, we mean 157% of upside. Those are the returns investors are looking at, should the stock make it all the way to Crosset's $21 price target. No need to add, the analyst’s rating is a Buy. (To watch Crossett’s track record, click here) Overall, even though this stock’s price is down, the analysts remain bullish; PRCH has 4 positive reviews for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are selling for $8.15 and their $21.63 average price target suggests a strong upside of 165% for the year ahead. (See PRCH stock forecast at TipRanks) Renewable Energy Group (REGI) From homes, we’ll turn to energy. Renewable Energy Group, REGI, is in the biofuel business, producing renewable fuels for a variety of markets. The company has facilities to produce, distribute, and retail a wide range of fuels, including biodiesel and other transportation fuels, oils for blended heating fuels, and bio-based glycerine and methyl esters for industrial and agricultural uses. The company has 12 biorefineries -- ten located in the United States and two in Germany. Eleven of its biorefineries produce biodiesel, while its Geismar, LA biorefinery produces renewable diesel. These assets have allowed REGI to post two consecutive quarters (2Q21 and 3Q21) of rising revenues. The 3Q21 result, the last reported, of $1.01 billion was up 22% from Q2, and an impressive 73% year-over-year. The company attributed the gains to ‘higher average selling prices’ in the past six months. Earnings per share also rose, although not as much as revenues. The 83 cent EPS reports in Q3 was up from 60 cents (a gain of 38%), but was only half the Q2 value of $1.62. The divergence reflects the volatile nature of the fuel industry. In recent weeks, REGI has been expanding its operations. In January, the company acquired Amber resources, a California-based distributor of gasoline, diesel, lubricating oils, and other transportation fuel components. The move adds more than 60 million gallons per year of sales to REGI’s portfolio. In February, the company made two important announcement. First, that it will be investing in a pretreatment facility in Germany, in a project in Emden. The project will improve REGI’s ability to refine low-carbon-intensity, hard-to-convert waste fats and oils for biodiesel production in the European markets. And in the US markets, REGI has entered into a partnership with Bunker Holding Group, the world’s largest marine fuel supplier. The move will expand REGI’s footprint in the US and EU markets for marine biodiesel fuels. Despite the company’s rising revenues and continued profitability, REGI has seen its share price drop 65% over the past 12 months. In coverage for Cowen, analyst Jason Gabelman explains why he sees this drop as an opportunity for investors. ""We estimate REGI is getting 0 value for its biodiesel business (ex volumes sold with RD), and see current price levels as an attractive entry point, especially for those willing to wait until Geismar value is more reflected in equity. The stock could also benefit as investors embed value for Cali's cap-and-trade,"" Gabelman noted. ""The stock has been impacted by concerns around Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) and declining LCFS prices. Proposed RVOs should accommodate new biomass-based diesel coming online in '22, reducing competitive risk to REGI's biodiesel business,"" the analyst added. To this end, Gabelman sets an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on REGI, and his $75 price target indicates its potential for ~125% upside by the end of 2022. (To watch Gabelman’s track record, click here) Overall, REGI has managed to pick up a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating from Wall Street, based on 7 positive reviews. The stock is selling for $33.40 and the $79.71 average price target implies ~139% upside from that level.
