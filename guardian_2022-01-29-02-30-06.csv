1/29/2022,"It’s beginning to look a lot like a cover-up. Is that too cynical? Maybe we should just congratulate Boris Johnson on a wonderful piece of luck, a convenient turn of events just in the nick of time. Having seen nothing to investigate in the partygate affair until this week, the Metropolitan police swooped down at the very moment Sue Gray was ready to press print on her long-awaited report – one that threatened to terminate Johnson’s premiership – and stayed her hand. The Met told Gray she can say what she likes about parties in Downing Street, so long as she says nothing about parties in Downing Street. Or as it put it: “For the events the Met is investigating, we asked for minimal reference to be made in the Cabinet Office report.” It stresses that it “did not ask for any limitations on other events in the report”, which is a bit like saying: “On all the stuff that no one cares about, go ahead: knock yourself out.” Indeed, with this move, the Met have all but ensured that whatever remains of Gray’s report will, if ever published, be waved away by Johnson and his defenders: if Gray was allowed to publish it, they’ll say, it can’t be that serious.  That is not where the bar should be set. The issue is not only whether Johnson was guilty of criminal violations of Covid regulations, but whether he broke a lockdown that he imposed on everyone else and whether he misled parliament. Those judgments cannot be outsourced to a police force, especially one led by a commissioner who has good reason to feel she only remains in her post thanks to the mercy of the prime minister. Those are decisions that should be made by politicians and voters, with access to all the facts. That prospect is receding. Gray now faces a choice: either publish a gutted version of her report, which Downing Street will falsely spin as having cleared the prime minister, or delay it until the police have completed their work. It’s all too plausible to imagine a Met statement, weeks or months from now, announcing that, having conducted its investigation, it has concluded that no further action need be taken. Team Johnson will spin that too as exoneration. And whatever facts Gray discovered will remain in the drafts folder of her laptop. What would be the effect of that? I don’t mean in narrow political terms, though it would clearly boost Johnson’s prospects of retaining his job. I mean the consequences for our public and collective life. What does it do to a country to be led by a documented liar? That’s a question we can ask with or without the Gray report. We can put aside the entire partygate affair and the question still stands. Even Johnson’s admirers concede his proven record of mendacity. They know that he was sacked twice for lying, once by the Times, once by Michael Howard, then his party leader. They remember the fictional £350m on the side of the bus. They have seen more evidence of his dishonesty this week, when documents emerged saying Johnson intervened personally to help Pen Farthing get his animals out of Kabul – ahead of desperate Afghans whose help for Britain had put a Taliban target on their backs – despite the prime minister’s insistence that he had done no such thing. The pattern is so clear, it cannot be denied. What is that doing to us? We can see the effect in two countries that are or were led by practised liars. Vladimir Putin is what the moral philosopher Quassim Cassam calls “a strategic liar”: his lies are part of a worked-out strategy, aimed less at convincing the Russian public than confusing it, making it dependent on the strongman in the Kremlin who can present himself as the only source of clarity in a fog of doubt. Donald Trump’s lies, meanwhile, fall into the “pathological” category, a function of a sociopathic personality. The effect in the US is obvious enough: Trump, in office and out of it, has entrenched a situation in which a large chunk of the American population inhabits a realm heedless of truth, evidence and science. The strongest predictor of whether or not an American has taken the Covid vaccine is whether or not they voted for Donald Trump. Johnson is his own case. The £350m was a strategic lie, advanced to great effect, but many of his lies are casual and opportunistic, the kind of lie someone offers to get themselves out of a tight spot, “the kind of lie”, says Cassam, “that people who have affairs have to tell”. It is a habit Johnson cannot break. He could, for example, have defended his role in the Kabul pet airlift. Instead he denied it. It was his first reflex. Even casual lies have their effect. The first could be a shift in democratic norms, which change more than you might think. It was once taboo for a chancellor to reveal any of his budget until he had delivered it: in 1947, Hugh Dalton had to resign for breaking that unwritten rule. Now it’s routine for chancellors to give the papers multiple sneak previews of their budgets. The old norm faded. We may well be witnessing another, much more significant shift right now, upending the convention that a minister proven to have misled parliament must resign. If Johnson stays, that norm will come to look as archaic as the one that felled Dalton. Will the Johnson effect spread beyond Westminster, so that even among regular people the taboo on lying erodes? It’s tempting to laugh that off, to insist that few Britons base their day-to-day behaviour on the conduct of politicians. Besides, the insistence on truth is one norm that society cannot afford to let slip. As Cassam notes: “Human beings are social beings, who need to be able to rely on each other. That requires trust, and trust requires truth-telling.” But there is a third zone, between parliament and day-to-day life: namely, our public institutions. It’s naive to think that they are not affected, or contaminated, by the actions of the man at the top. If Johnson’s lies go unpunished, that will surely alter the norms that currently govern, say, senior civil servants. Which prompts a much sharper worry. If the public decides it can no longer trust those in authority, then when the chief medical officer stands up to warn of a new threat to public health, there is no guarantee that anybody will listen. In the US, they’re halfway there. The death threats against Dr Anthony Fauci are so frequent and severe, he now has 24-hour armed security. As trust has declined, it’s been replaced by “raw anger and hatred, conspiracy theories to explain the world, the belief that facts and evidence do not matter”, says Peter Pomerantsev, a keen student of politicians’ lies and author of This Is Not Propaganda. That’s what can happen when a liar runs the country. In November 2020, Americans got rid of theirs. Ours clings on – and now, it seems, his friends in the Met have helped him live to fight another day.

1/29/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has talked down the threat of an imminent Russian invasion and said the UK and US were wrong to pull out non-essential diplomatic staff from Kyiv, adding: “We don’t have a Titanic here”. Zelenskiy said on Friday he was acutely aware of the dangers posed by the 100,000 Russian troops gathered on Ukraine’s border. But he appeared to disagree with the Biden administration’s bleak assessment that a Russian attack was “distinctly possible” next month.  In a briefing to foreign media organisations, including the Guardian, Zelenskiy shrugged off claims his government was in denial, with an attitude that commentators on social media had compared to the Netflix drama: “Don’t look up”. “We are looking up. We do understand what is happening. But we have been in the situation for eight years. We should not only be looking up but also at the ground,’” he said. “The threat is constant.” He added: “We can’t say the war will happen tomorrow or by the end of February. Yes, it may happen, unfortunately. But you have to feel the pulse on a day-to-day basis.” Asked if Boris Johnson’s government had made a mistake in withdrawing some diplomats, Zelenskiy said: “Yes. In these circumstances everyone is essential.” He noted that the Greeks had kept open their consulate in the city of Mariupol, next to the frontline with Russian-backed separatists. “You can hear canons firing. The Greeks didn’t pull anyone out. The captains should not leave the ship. I don’t think we have a Titanic here.” Zelenskiy added that the recent buildup of Kremlin forces was “no more intense” than in spring 2021. “If you look at the satellite you will see the increase of troops. You can’t assess if it’s a threat, an attack or simple rotation,” he said, adding that some of the tents used by Russian soldiers appeared to be empty. Moscow moved in additional troops before major diplomatic negotiations, he said. “It’s psychological. They want to make believe they are there. They are trying to build up psychological pressure.” Zelenskiy denied differences with the US administration, after a phone call on Thursday night with Biden. “We don’t have any misunderstandings with President Biden. I just deeply understand what’s happening in my country, just as he does with the US,” he said. “Do we have tanks on the streets? No,” he said. Hyped media reports were causing panic in the financial sector, damaging the “purse” of Ukrainians, and depleting Ukraine’s gold reserves and currency, he said. Zelenskiy was speaking at his official residence in Kyiv, the Mariinski palace, a neo-classical building overlooking the River Dnipro and next to the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s lower house of parliament. The US believes the threat of a Russian invasion next month of Ukraine remains real. The US ambassador in Moscow, John Sullivan, has said a Kremlin operation could be imminent, citing the extraordinary buildup of Russian troops at the border. The deployment, which includes joint military exercises with Belarus, is destabilising and threatening to Ukraine, Sullivan said. On Thursday the US national security council spokesperson, Emily Horne, quoted Biden as saying a February invasion was “distinctly possible”. Zelenskiy, however, has pushed back against the idea that a Russian attack was inevitable. Instead, his government has told Ukrainians to keep calm, saying they should carry on as normal and “take it easy”, in the words of one minister. The US and UK this week withdrew non-essential embassy staff from Kyiv. Zelenskiy, asked if this was a mistake, said: “Yes. For us it’s mistake. In these circumstances everyone is essential.” He said that Greece had kept its consulate in the city of Mariupol open, right next to the frontline with Russian-backed separatists. “You can hear canons firing. The Greeks didn’t pull anyone out. The captains should not leave the ship. I don’t think we have a Titanic here.” Zelenskiy has previously pointed out that Ukraine has been at war for nearly eight years, since Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea in 2014 and started a separatist conflict in the Donbas region in the east. Despite these apparent differences, Zelenskiy has been keen to emphasise unity with the US, his country’s key international partner. He has disavowed an apparent briefing made to CNN, which suggested Kyiv wanted Washington to dial down talk of imminent conflict. During a phone call on Thursday, Biden told Zelenskiy the White House was considering economic support to Ukraine after $650m (£484m) in military assistance over the past year. Biden “reaffirmed the readiness of the United States along with its allies and partners to respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine”, a White House statement said. Zelenskiy said he had discussed with Biden international attempts to find a peaceful way out of the crisis. “Discussed recent diplomatic efforts on de-escalation and agreed on joint actions for the future,” Zelenskiy said on Twitter on Thursday evening. He thanked Biden for the ongoing military assistance in the form of weapons. Russia has denied it will invade but it has said the US’s written response, delivered on Wednesday, did not meet its security demands. On Friday Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow did not want war, but was prepared to take its own tough measures if necessary. Had a long phone conversation with @POTUS. Discussed recent diplomatic efforts on de-escalation and agreed on joint actions for the future. Thanked President @JoeBiden for the ongoing military assistance. Possibilities for financial support to Ukraine were also discussed. pic.twitter.com/pAsQLYAuig Russia wants the US to veto Ukraine’s future membership of Nato, and for Nato to remove its troops from eastern Europe, including from Romania and Bulgaria. The US has rejected the demand, which in effect seeks to reestablish a cold war-style zone of Russian influence in former Warsaw Pact countries. Western experts and Ukrainian analysts believe the Kremlin has not yet assembled a sufficient force needed for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. They believe a more likely scenario is a “hybrid” attack, featuring cyber an infrastructure shutdowns, with an intensification of military activity across the “line of contact” between the Ukrainian military and Russian-armed separatists. Speaking on Friday, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, said 112,000 Russian servicemen were on the border, with the number increasing to about 130,000, including navy and aviation personnel. Reznikov said the deployment was no bigger than last April, when Russia dispatched 126,000 troops. The reaction from the international community was “disproportionate”, he told the Rada.",News/World news,‘We don’t have a Titanic here’: Ukraine plays down threat of Russian invasion ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/ukraine-plays-down-threat-of-russian-invasion-volodymyr-zelenskiy
1/29/2022,"China’s ambassador to the US has said the two countries could face a “military conflict” over the future of Taiwan, in an unusually explicit reference to the prospect of war. “The Taiwan issue is the biggest tinderbox between China and the United States,” Qin Gang told the US public broadcaster National Public Radio (NPR), on Friday. “If the Taiwanese authorities, emboldened by the United States, keep going down the road for independence, it most likely will involve China and the United States, the two big countries, in the military conflict.”  Tensions over the island’s place in the world continue to grow. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a breakaway province of China. In November the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, told Joe Biden that any support for Taiwanese independence from the US would be “like playing with fire” and that “those who play with fire will get burned”. Beijing has been ratcheting up its pressure on the democratically ruled island in recent years. In October Xi vowed to realise “reunification” with Taiwan by peaceful means. But on Sunday China’s air force flew 39 warplanes into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone – the largest daily number since October. The US and some of its allies have in the past few months advocated for Taiwan’s “meaningful participation in the UN system”, a move that angered China. The UK parliament’s foreign affairs committee reportedly plans to visit Taiwan next month. Qin blamed the current state of affairs on the Taiwanese administration. He accused it of “seek[ing] its independence agenda by borrowing the support and the encouragement of the United States”. He added: “And the United States is playing the Taiwan card to contain China.” Analysts say that although Qin’s warning to Washington is unusual, he also pointed out in the NPR interview that the bilateral ties constituted China’s “most important relationship”. “Such a confrontation would risk a permanent rupture in the bilateral relationship,” said Ali Wyne, a senior analyst on US-China relations at Eurasia Group in Washington. “While China often avows that its ‘great rejuvenation’ is predicated upon Taiwan’s reunification with the mainland, there are probably few other steps Beijing could take that would undermine its long-term strategic prospects as greatly as attacking Taipei.”",News/World news,China’s ambassador to US warns of possible military conflict over Taiwan,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/china-ambassador-us-warns-possible-military-conflict-taiwan
1/29/2022,"My father, Tony Heath, who has died aged 96, was a journalist, local politician and campaigner for justice. Over more than 30 years he wrote for newspapers and journals including the Guardian, Independent, Observer, New Statesman, New Society and Private Eye. Writing for Tribune magazine in August 1973 as its education correspondent, he was the first person to use the term “Thatcherism”, signposting its shortcomings as a political philosophy. He wrote: “It will be argued that teachers are members of a profession which must not be influenced by political considerations. With the blight of Thatcherism spreading across the land that is a luxury that only the complacent can afford.”  One of two sons of Jimmy Heath, a pit foreman at the Tredegar colliery, and Kathleen (nee Harding), Tony was born in Tredegar, south Wales, and went to the local school. He was called up for second world war service, and took part in the D-day landings. On 25 April 1945, he was serving with the 13th/18th Royal Hussars Armoured Corps on the outskirts of Bremen when the Sherman tank he was in took a direct hit from a German tank. Tony managed to bail out but saw his best mate, Eddie Moulding, trapped and burned to death. Tony’s hearing was permanently damaged and for the rest of his life he suffered nightmares about what he had witnessed. After the war Tony took part in the clearing-up process, including escorting trains from one sector in Berlin to another to exchange supplies. On his return to Britain he worked for PR companies in London. His last PR job was for the American-owned advertising agency Foote, Cone and Belding in Baker Street. His departure followed his decision to take a day’s leave and hand out leaflets at the FCB entrance calling for the withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam. In London he met Dorothea Smither (nee Hill), a widow with two sons, who was then working as a fashion model. They married in 1954 and settled in Reigate, Surrey. In the 1960s Tony was elected a member of Surrey county council for the Labour party. He gave vociferous support to staff from the Guildford School of Art who in 1968 were sacked by the council for having supported a student sit-in. In 1974 my parents upped sticks to Blaenau Ffestiniog, north Wales, where Tony resumed his career as a journalist. In the 1980s, reporting for the Guardian on the second homes bombing campaign and the Sons of Glendower nationalist movement, he was tipped off that a cache of arms from Ireland would be landed at Black Rock sands in Gwynedd in the small hours. As he hid in the dunes and waited for the boat, his watch was interrupted by armed Security Service personnel who wanted to know what he was doing there. Possibly alerted by their bright lights, the boat never arrived. My father never formally retired and his byline continued to appear in various publications when he was into his 80s. Dorothea died in 2012, and Tony spent the last nine years of his life in a residential home in Hay-on-Wye. Tony’s brother, Peter, predeceased him. He is survived by me.",News/Media,Tony Heath obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/28/tony-heath-obituary
1/29/2022,"The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is to travel to Russia in the next two weeks for talks with her Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, the Russian embassy in London has announced. The Foreign Office did not confirm the visit but it is likely to go ahead and will be the first of its kind for five years. Russia claims the visit was requested by the UK.  Truss was already due to visit Kyiv next week where she will meet the Ukrainian prime minister, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Britain has been among the Nato countries advocating tough measures to deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine, and has provided 2,000 anti-tank weapons to Kyiv. Last June the Royal Navy’s HMS Defender sailed close to Crimea to underline the UK government’s view that the peninsula remains Ukrainian territory. The UK has also provided £1.8bn in loans to help Ukraine strengthen its navy, actions that British diplomats say have led to the closest relations ever between the two countries. Ukraine is eager to expand that alliance into a trilateral alliance by including Poland, bringing together the three powers most hostile to Russia in Europe. Over the weekend Truss, the formal political head of the intelligence services, accused Russia of being behind a plot to topple the Ukrainian president and replace him with a Russian puppet leader. She has repeatedly claimed Russia will be making a massive strategic mistake if it invades Ukraine and will face severe consequences. Russia, believing the UK is in decline post-Brexit, accused her of reading too many spy novels. The last British foreign secretary to travel to Moscow was Boris Johnson in December 2017. Theresa May met Vladimir Putin on the margins of the G20 in 2019 – the first time the two sides had met at that level since the poisoning of a UK double agent by Russia led to a full-scale diplomatic collapse. One purpose of the Truss meeting will be to try to spell out to Russia that any economic sanctions imposed in the event of an invasion of Ukraine will affect not just the Russian economy but the personal wealth of some of Putin’s closest personal allies. Much of that money is invested in the London property market. There has been pressure from the Biden administration to force the UK to take a tougher stance about Russian oligarchs. A report on the UK’s Russia strategy published by Chatham House on Friday echoed the US state department’s concerns that the UK has not done enough to show it will rein in some of the Russian oligarchs that invest in UK property. The Chatham House report says: “The City of London’s role as a global financial services hub gives the UK more leverage than many of Russia’s other commercial partners – if the government is prepared to tolerate the hit to specific (and politically well connected) sectors of the UK economy that would result from more stringent sanctions.” UK officials continue to insist they have strong anti-corruption legislation, but there is a head of steam developing in the US at what is regard as the Conservative party’s reluctance to challenge some of its prominent donors. The Foreign Office said Truss would continue to travel by chartered planes. She landed herself in hot water recently when it was revealed the taxpayer had been left with a £500,000 bill after she charted a private jet to fly to Australia for a three-day visit. The Foreign Office said it was a plane hired by the UK government, and if she travelled commercially she would in effect be out of action for 24 hours in each direction since she had to access top-secret information every day, which would not be possible on a normal commercial flight.",News/Politics,"Truss will meet Lavrov in Moscow within next two weeks, says Russia ",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/28/uk-russian-foreign-ministers-liz-truss-sergei-lavrov-to-meet-in-next-fortnight
1/29/2022,"Channel 4 will have to explain why it failed to provide subtitles to viewers for several weeks last year, after key parts of its output were knocked off air in September following a fire alarm that inadvertently destroyed its computer equipment. The media regulator Ofcom has launched an investigation into the incident at the London offices of the media company Red Bee, which provides many leading broadcasters with the equipment that gets television broadcasts on air.  The activation of a fire suppression system inadvertently destroyed many of the hard drives in the servers housed in the building and required two months of round-the-clock work to rebuild Channel 4’s systems. Although other broadcasters also use Red Bee’s services, Channel 4 was particularly badly affected because its back-up broadcast system also failed. In addition to breaking the subtitling system, the incident knocked out many audio description and signing services, took some of Channel 4’s channels off air completely, and – in a move that infuriated fans of the programme – led to Channel 4 accidentally replacing the finale of Married at First Sight Australia with an old episode. Although Channel 4 still met its statutory requirement to have 90% of programming on all services with subtitles, Ofcom said it would investigate why the broadcaster was unable to provide service used “by millions, including deaf, hard-of-hearing, blind and partially sighted people, to watch and listen to television”. Subtitles are increasingly popular among viewers, not just for the hard of hearing but also for general audiences who find it easier to follow programmes with them on screen. Ofcom will also undertake a review of the transmission arrangements and backup facilities that all of the affected broadcasters had in place at the time of the outage.",News/Media,Ofcom to investigate Channel 4 over weeks-long subtitles outage ,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/28/ofcom-to-investigate-channel-4-over-weeks-long-subtitles-outage

1/29/2022,"My friend Joan Capp, who has died aged 89, was a passionate advocate of peace and justice for the poor, who raised and personally delivered thousands of pounds’ worth of humanitarian aid to more than a dozen countries, from Bosnia and Romania to Pakistan and Uganda. I first spoke to her in 1996 when, having seen a TV report of mine about a devastated care home in the war-torn Chechen capital, Grozny, she contacted me to find out how she could help. Despite my advice that travelling there was highly dangerous, she filled a 40-tonne truck with blankets, bedding, food, heaters and other equipment, and set off in the passenger seat, with two drivers, to deliver it.  After a hair-raising journey across Europe, sleeping at night in the cab, she made sure that she personally handed over the goods to the Chechen woman who was in charge of the home. It took my breath away to imagine this frail-looking, white-haired pensioner wagging her finger at Kalashnikov-wielding thugs at checkpoints, refusing to take no for an answer. I called her the Angel of Grozny. Joan was born in Prestwich in Greater Manchester, to Rosetta (nee Band) and her husband, Walter Bolton, a mechanical engineer. Joan’s schooling was limited, as she had to care for her ailing parents from the age of 12, after which she became a nurse at 17, first at Salford Royal hospital, then later as a district and surgery nurse in the village of Bootle in Cumbria. She worked there until she retired in 1987 and then immediately became involved in local charity work. But it was the televised wars of the 1990s, in former Yugoslavia and Chechnya, that sparked what became the defining mission of her later life. “I couldn’t bear to see people being evacuated from their homes,” she said. “I had to do something.” Untrusting of established charities, which she suspected of being inefficient and bureaucratic, she set herself up in effect as a one-woman humanitarian aid agency. With a friend she founded Bootle Refugee Aid Cumbria UK and made her first aid trips to Croatia in 1992. Her mission to help the needy became an obsession. Even in her later years, when she was blind and debilitated by illness, she would call me to tell me about her plans. In the darkness of her final months she wrote songs about peace, dedicated to the children of Mostar, Bosnia, whom she had met and helped 30 years before. Joan was appointed MBE in 2012. Her husband, Alan Capp, a Ministry of Defence employee, whom she married in 1952, died in 2005.

The students’ attention is waning in the hot midday sun – they are tired from an early morning start, a hike around the rocks of Auckland’s Whangaparaoa peninsula, and hours spent diving in the open ocean for kina (sea urchin). Some look at their phones, others chomp on pizza. But as he starts telling a story, their ears prick up.  “I thought I could swim to Australia when I was young. I thought I was fit, strong,” he starts. “But when I got caught in big waves and they were dumping on me, and my goggles were getting ripped off and I was getting sucked out into the big ones, into an impact zone, I was not prepared for that.” Wikaira now has a captive audience. “There were stories going round in the community: ‘Who are these crazy fullers going out in these rugged conditions?’ That was me and my mate,” he says. “We thought there was nothing wrong with it because we had never had an experience of drowning. That lesson saved my life. After that, I had so much respect for the ocean, the elements and what could happen.” It is a story Wikaira, an aquatic educator at Drowning Prevention Auckland, has told to the thousands of students he trains every year. As a Māori man – a demographic that features highly in New Zealand’s drowning toll – it is also a story he tells to save his own people. Since 1 December, there have been 39 deaths from drowning in New Zealand, making it the worst summer in six years, with still a month to go. There were 15 drownings during the official holiday period (24 December to 5 January) – a 180% increase on the five-year average, according to Water Safety New Zealand data. There were 74 drownings, including 15 people aged under 24, last year – on par with 2020 – despite longer periods spent in Covid-19-related lockdowns. An alarming number of those perishing are Māori men. In 2021, 31% were Māori (23 deaths) and 96% of those were men, despite Māori comprising just 16.5% of the total population. Māori have a strong ancestral relationship to the sea, including expert ocean navigation, and hunting and fishing for kaimoana (seafood). But that can come at a cost, says Wikaira. “We have this feeling that water is us and we are part of water and we can handle it, but I’m sure our ancestors also had protocols in place.” There is also pressure to provide for the family, often through free-diving for kaimoana, or fishing. “Sometimes your mana [prestige] is on the line to provide for your whānau [family], and that is a demonstration of your aroha [love] to people. I’ve felt that, even if it was rough weather, I was going to go and get a feed, and it nearly cost me my own life. I’m trying to help people think of the bigger picture – we don’t want to lose anyone to drowning.” Wikaira is acutely aware of the relationship between Māori and the moana (ocean), and uses tikanga (Māori customs) in his training, regardless of whether the student is Māori or not. The session teaches respect for the ocean and its power, while retaining love for all that it provides: after instructing his students on how to minimise fatigue using buoys, he then plucks a kina from the sea floor, and shows how to break it open to scoop out the buttery, briny flesh inside. “The delicacy of the sea,” he tells them, before happily swallowing it down. “Education is still the key, but like anything, it still comes down to who is going be the one flying the flag for whānau, or being a leader within their own home, and within the community,” he says. That includes regional councils educating people about their local waterways and taking clues from Māori place names, says Rob Hewitt, the Māori spokesperson for Water Safety New Zealand. “Waikino means bad water; Waiparu, dirty water. As Māori we know those are not good places to swim.” The Waikato River, meaning flowing water, where there were four drownings in 2021, comes with a saying, Hewitt says. “He piko he taniwha, he piko he taniwha’ – there is a taniwha (a water spirit or monster) around every corner.” Drowning remains the leading cause of recreational death and the third-highest cause of accidental death in New Zealand. “It’s a national tragedy,” says Daniel Gerrard, Water Safe New Zealand’s chief executive. “Every preventable death is devastating to a whānau and the community. “This is a horrific loss of lives and is unprecedented. It cuts through every age range, water activity and ethnicity. A common theme in these drownings was people underestimating the conditions and overestimating their ability.” Not all drownings are related to gathering food. Water Safety New Zealand says there are a number of factors, including a lack of water skills education for children, people not staying up to date with weather and ocean conditions, population growth and new arrivals to the country being unfamiliar with New Zealand’s turbulent waters. An ageing population with income and leisure time and a growth in aquatic sports such as kayaking and boating, as well as risk-taking extreme sports, could also be contributing to the rise. But another reason could be hotter days, and the allure of a dip in the sea or a river to get respite from the heat, says Hewitt. New Zealand experienced its hottest year on record in 2021, with December becoming the fourth warmest on record, the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research confirmed this month. There were four drownings in the Manawatū River over summer. In the days following the deaths of two Karen refugees from Myanmar, a rāhui (customary restriction) was placed on the area, but people were still turning up to swim there, says Hewitt, who was involved in the rescue response. “Two days after I recovered an 11-year-old, there were 20 people on the riverside. They were told that there was a rāhui, and all of them said ‘it doesn’t affect me’ and ‘it’s way too hot’. The heat is pushing them to the water,” Hewitt says. “It’s only going to get hotter. Now is the time that we really have to push, to make sure making sure that people are safe in, and around, the water.”",News/World news,‘A national tragedy’: Māori drowning rate causes alarm in New Zealand ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/29/a-national-tragedy-maori-drowning-rate-causes-alarm-in-new-zealand
1/29/2022,"Netflix will face a $5m defamation lawsuit by a Georgian chess master who alleges she was defamed in the hit series The Queen’s Gambit, after a judge refused to toss the suit on Thursday. Nona Gaprindashvili, the first woman to be named a chess grandmaster, sued the streaming company in federal court in September. Gaprindashvili alleges that a line from The Queen’s Gambit, where a character incorrectly states that she had “never faced men”, is “grossly sexist and belittling”. Gaprindashvili had played against 59 male competitors by 1968, the year the show is set.  Damages are sought for what the suit claims is a “devastating falsehood, undermining and degrading her accomplishments before an audience of many millions”. Netflix had previously asked for the defamation suit to be dismissed, arguing that the series is a piece of fiction and that show’s creators should have artistic license protected under the first amendment. Netflix further argued that the show used two chess experts to certify details in the series, noting that the reference to Gaprindashvili was meant to “recognize her, not disparage her”, according to the streamer’s lawyers. But on Thursday’s ruling in California, first reported by Variety, US District Judge Virginia A Phillips found that Gaprindashvili’s argument was reasonable, noting that works of fiction were not immune from defamation if real people were slandered. “Netflix does not cite, and the Court is not aware, of any cases precluding defamation claims for the portrayal of real persons in otherwise fictional works,” wrote Phillips. “The fact that the Series was a fictional work does not insulate Netflix from liability for defamation if all the elements of defamation are otherwise present.” The Queen’s Gambit, which won 11 Emmy awards in 2021, is based on the 1983 novel by Walter Tevis. The fictional limited series follows the character of Beth Harmon, an American played by Anya Taylor-Joy, as she rises through the ranks of competitive chess in the 1960s. Gaprindashvili is now 80 and lives in Tbilisi, Georgia. “They were trying to do this fictional character who was blazing the trail for other women, when in reality I had already blazed the trail and inspired generations,” Gaprindashvili said in an interview with the New York Times. “That’s the irony.” The suit also noted that the film portrayed her as Russian, although she is Georgian.",Sport/Sport,First female chess grandmaster sues Netflix over false claim in Queen’s Gambit,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/28/first-female-chess-grandmaster-sues-netflix-queens-gambit
1/29/2022,"Downing Street has insisted Boris Johnson is “fully committed” to introducing a national insurance rise in the spring, despite reports he is “wobbling” on the issue. The manifesto-breaking rise of 1.25% in national insurance contributions (NICs) was presented by Johnson as a way of tackling the NHS backlog and reforming social care.  Rightwing Conservatives who are opposed to rising taxes are seeking to exploit the prime minister’s current weakness by urging him to scrap it or delay its introduction. A government source told the Times that Johnson was “wobbling” over the rise, adding that he “would do anything to survive” his current difficulties over Downing Street parties. And sources told the Guardian that the Treasury was becoming increasingly alarmed that Johnson might be preparing to scrap the rise, scuppering public finances. But, pressed on those reports on Friday, a No 10 spokesperson said: “The prime minister and chancellor are fully committed to introducing the health and social care levy in April. We’ve spoken before about why we are doing that – in order to give the NHS the funds it needs to tackle the backlog that has built up, as well as tackling the long-term issue of social care.” Speculation about the planned NICs rise was fuelled this week when Johnson’s refused to offer a cast-iron guarantee that it would go ahead amid growing concerns about cost-of-living pressures. The defence minister James Heappey told the BBC’s Question Time on Thursday that the government was “in listening mode” when it came to assessing the policy. On Friday, however, both No 10 and the technology minister, Chris Philp, offered a stern defence of the tax rise, insisting it would be enacted as planned. Philp denied any delay was being considered, telling LBC the “plan is to proceed as intended”. He said the rise, and subsequent introduction of the health and social care levy from 2023, would provide £36bn over three years to fund the NHS and social care. Opposition to the change has come from all sides of the Commons, as MPs fear the impact that increasing financial demands could have on stretched household budgets at a time of high inflation and soaring energy costs. The former minister Robert Halfon said the government should look at different ways to support struggling families, including further possible cuts to overseas aid, rather than ploughing ahead with the NICs rise. Labour is also opposed to the rise. Speaking to reporters on a visit to Glasgow, its leader, Keir Starmer, said: “The prime minister needs to act on this. We’ve got a very serious issue here, with everybody facing prices going up, whether that’s fuel, energy bills at home, inflation going up to something like 6%, the worst it’s been since the John Major years. “And at that very moment, Boris Johnson and his government want to impose a tax hike on people in April.” The proposed 1.25% rise for workers and employers is due to begin in April after it was agreed by cabinet and voted on by MPs, with only five Tory MPs voting against, and 37 not voting. From 2023, the contribution is due to drop back to its current rate, with a 1.25% health and social care levy then applied to raise funds for improvements to care services. In the 2019 Tory election manifesto the party had ruled out increasing national insurance if returned to power.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson ‘fully committed’ to national insurance rise,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/28/boris-johnson-fully-committed-to-national-insurance-rise
1/29/2022,"Scientists have developed a highly sensitive Covid test that relies only on low-tech kit and a smartphone, which could be used as a quicker, cheaper alternative to PCR testing. The team behind the 25-minute saliva test say it provides a highly reliable platform for testing in the workplace or at home. It requires a basic lab kit that includes a cardboard box, a small hot plate and LED light that can be produced for less than £75. The cost of running a test, including the reagents, is about a 10th of a PCR test and is also cheaper than a lateral flow test. The team’s findings are published in the journal JAMA Network Open.  “As new Covid variants emerge globally, testing and detection remain essential to pandemic control efforts,” said Dr Michael Mahan, of the University of California, Santa Barbara and lead author. “Nearly half the world’s population has a smartphone, and we believe that this holds exciting potential to provide fair and equal access to precision diagnostic medicine.” The test uses a process called Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (Lamp) to amplify viral RNA in the saliva and detect specific target genes. The app, which is freely available, uses a smartphone’s camera to measure colour changes indicating a chemical reaction and determines a diagnosis in 25 minutes. When tested in 50 patients with Covid, it matched PCR testing for sensitivity. The same technique was also applied successfully to diagnosing flu infections. Alexander Edwards, of the University of Reading, said the work demonstrates it is possible to move testing out of the laboratory. “This interesting report is important in showing the accuracy of a relatively simple test for virus in swabs from clinical samples,” he said. “However, many other research groups have already shown that this type of technology and test simplification can work. The challenge remains how to deliver large-scale products based on this type of technology, and to make simple, accessible products that people can make use of.”",News/World news,US scientists develop cheap smartphone-based test kit for Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/us-scientists-develop-cheap-smartphone-based-test-kit-for-covid
1/29/2022,"Home pressure is a concept of legendary status at the Australian Open. Just ask Sam Stosur. Or Lleyton Hewitt. Or Pat Rafter. Each and every year a new number is added to the same statistic. As long as 1978 gets a mention the picture is painted, the inglorious drought of Australia’s players at their home grand slam once again wrenched from the history books and hoisted about as high as that trophy might be had anyone actually won the thing recently. Being 2022, it is now 44 years since Christine O’Neil did, on grass, at Kooyong. Ash Barty, of course, knows all of this. Her results of the past three years here read: quarter-final, semi-final, quarter-final. She too would have felt the infamous squeeze in her chest of an expectant country behind her.  Not that Barty would speak publicly about it – or at all, for all we know. She is a self-described “creature of habit”. She keeps her powder dry. Nice and predictable. And, predictably, having now sat atop the world rankings for more than two-and-a-half years, the 25-year-old is quite some distance above the rest of the women’s singles field. Similarly, as anticipated, she is playing it cool and channelling Billie Jean “pressure is a privilege” King. “Absolutely embrace it,” Barty said. “You have to. It’s fun. It’s brilliant to be playing in the business end of your home slam. I’m not gonna lie about that. It’s amazing. “Being able to experience it multiple times has been incredible, but Saturday’s going to be a new experience for me. So I go out there and embrace it, smile, try and do the best that I can and whatever happens, happens.” Few would bet against her beating Danielle Collins in the final. The American has been a feelgood story this tournament, and she too is making a point of embracing her first experience of a major final after making a semi-final statement against the Polish seventh seed Iga Swiatek. “She’s an exceptional ball-striker,” Barty said of Collins. “She’s someone who stands on the baseline and can hit all spots of the court from any position. I think the challenge is going to be trying to get her off-balance.” One might imagine Barty might get her off-balance in much the same way as she ended the run of Collins’s compatriot, Madison Keys, in one hour and two minutes in her own semi-final on Thursday. Add that the Queenslander has won 20 straight sets and 81 of her last 82 service games. She has, according to Lindsay Davenport, champion here in 2000, “Serena-esque” service numbers. Tennis, however, is more than a numbers game, and Barty is more than a toolbox of statistics. She is a person full of quiet confidence, with a small but tight-knit team around her. She is also a Ngarigo woman, and the first Indigenous player to contest an Australian Open final since Evonne Goolagong Cawley won it over four consecutive years between 1974 and 1977. Last year, when Barty won Wimbledon – her second slam crown – exactly 50 years after Goolagong Cawley’s own Wimbledon title, she hoped she had “made Evonne proud”. The very next day Goolagong Cawley, a Wiradjuri woman, offered her own tribute to her “little sister”, having sensed it was “her time”. Her time was then, and it is also now. That triumph at the All England Club was felt on the other side of the world, in a country still reckoning with racial inequality. It was a high-profile nod to the 500 different First Nations peoples who make up what is officially called Australia. To repeat the achievement at home may, it is hoped, further assist a reshaping of the public discourse. Goolagong Cawley, who is a mentor to Barty, will not be present at centre court. But O’Neil is a confirmed Rod Laver Arena attendee, and joked with media this week she has “enjoyed being a good trivia question”. “But I’d be happy to hand it over to her,” she said, “because she is so deserving of it.” She may even get to meet her. Barty herself is also well-versed in history. Unlike Wendy Turnbull, the last Australian woman to reach the final in 1980, it is highly unlikely that she will play her decider in front of Elton John. It is less likely still that a ball boy will hand-deliver her a note reading “you can do it, love Elton.” Tennis was a different game back then, and Kooyong was nothing like today’s slick facility that is Melbourne Park. But while Barty is the quintessential modern-day champion, she is firmly connected with her past. “I love Kooyong, I’m a Kooyong girl,” she said. “That’s my club down here in Melbourne. I love the grass there. I’m yet to be able to really enjoy a full grass-court season at the Kooyong courts. “I can just imagine what it would have been like, the way that the stadium is set up. I’ve said a couple of times I wish I was maybe born in a different era and I got to experience playing on grass courts all year long. It would have been incredible. “But the development that has come with moving to Melbourne Park has been incredible to encourage fans to come and enjoy it with us. Obviously the courts, the way the game has changed over the last 20, 30 years has been incredible as well.” Or 44 years.",Sport/Sport,Ash Barty determined not to let the weight of history drag her down | Emma Kemp,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/28/ash-barty-weight-of-history-australian-open-final-danielle-collins
1/29/2022,"Midway through an acting career she abandoned early, out of frustrations with her casting, Yvette Mimieux, who has died aged 80, said the parts she was offered were usually “sex objects or vanilla pudding”. Her pale beauty was striking, but ethereal rather than fragile; qualities that led to the early roles that foreshadowed her entire career. “I suppose I have a soulful quality,” she said. “I was often cast as a wounded person, the sensitive soul.” She was only 15 when the talent agent Jim Byron supposedly spotted her from his helicopter while she walked a horse in the Hollywood Hills; he landed and gave her his card. The other version of the story was more mundane: he spotted her auditioning for a bit part in Elvis Presley’s Jailhouse Rock. He generated publicity for her through beauty contests and modelling.  By the time she was 17 she had landed an uncredited bit part in the film of Françoise Sagan’s A Certain Smile (1958), and appeared in the popular TV shows Yancy Derringer, Mr Lucky and One Step Beyond. MGM put her under contract, and gave her a small, bikini-clad role in Platinum High School (1960). But she caught the public eye opposite Rod Taylor in George Pal’s adaptation of HG Wells’s The Time Machine (1960), playing Weena, the beautiful Eloi blissfully unaware that she and her fellows are raised in idyllic peace as cattle to be eaten by the underground Morlocks. In the erstwhile hit comedy Where the Boys Are, she proved the “spring break” movie’s darkness as a student who is a victim of date rape and gets hit by a car as she staggers down the highway in her torn dress. She made the cover of Life magazine in 1961, described as a “warmly wistful starlet”, but Modern Romances scooped Life by using an earlier, anonymous modelling photo of her on their cover the same week. A week later, the press reported that the teenage star had been married in 1959, to a student, Evan Engber, who was now doing his military service. She reprised the charmingly innocent and unaware Weena in Light in the Piazza (1962), as Olivia de Havilland’s adult daughter rendered permanently a pre-teen girl by a childhood fall from a horse that halted her mental development. On holiday she falls in love with a wealthy Italian, played by George Hamilton, who had acted with her in Where the Boys Are. He was totally unconvincing in the role, but had lobbied as an MGM contract player to replace the Cuban-Italian actor Tomas Milian, who might have provided a better contrast to Mimieux’s American child. Her celebrity was cemented by Tyger, Tyger, a two-part episode broadcast in early 1964 of the TV hit Dr Kildare, starring Richard Chamberlain. She guest-starred as a surfing-mad teenager who suffers epileptic seizures. Her scenes in a bikini, including one where she balances on her parents’ coffee table to demonstrate her love for surfing to Kildare, are thought to be the first appearance of a navel on US TV. She had, officially, just turned 22 (her birth date is sometimes given as 1939), and had made eight movies, but stardom continued to elude her. Mimieux was born in Los Angeles. Her father, René, was French, and worked as a film extra and electrician; her mother, Maria (nee Montemayor) was Mexican. Some of her publicity claimed she had studied archaeology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and that she had met Engber there. As one of the last wave of MGM contract players she was doubly typecast, first by studio executives there, and then by other studios who sought her on loan to play those types of roles. She showed some talent in the adaptation of Lillian Hellman’s Toys in the Attic (1963), but she was back playing a young married woman too innocent for sex in Joy in the Morning (1965), and standard love interests in various action films. In The Desperate Hours (1967), an early TV movie remake of the Frank Sinatra thriller, she was literally a vulnerable hostage. Her best part came while she was loaned to American International for the black comedy Three in the Attic (1968), as one of three women holding their womanising boyfriend prisoner. She moved to starring in a TV detective series, The Most Deadly Game (1970-71), alongside Ralph Bellamy and George Maharis; she got the part following the death of Inger Stevens. She featured in another TV movie remake, of Death Takes a Holiday, opposite Monte Markham, and the growing market for TV movies meant that between 1971 and 1984 she made 13 of them, mostly forgettable, but including a remake of Bell, Book and Candle (1976) in which she took the role played by Kim Novak in the 1958 film. In 1972 she married the director of musicals Stanley Donen. He moved back to the US from the UK in 1975, but his career was waning, and they never worked together. Growing more frustrated, Mimieux wrote the TV movie Hit Lady (1974), to give herself a meatier role. But her career’s apotheosis came in Jackson County Jail (1976), a Roger Corman B-movie, which cast her as a California teacher – falsely accused in the deep south of a crime – who kills her jailer when he tries to rape her. It was as if Mimieux, teamed with Tommy Lee Jones, was fighting back against years of being cast as victims. She co-wrote and produced the TV movie Obsessive Love (1984), in which she played a John Hinckley-inspired role as an over-the-top fan of a soap star. In 1985 she was cast in a TV series, Berrenger’s, a Dallas-like drama set in a New York department store. That year she and Donen divorced; she retired from acting and married the entrepreneur Howard Ruby. She began painting, pursued her interests in archaeology and Haitian art, and together they took up the cause of protecting Arctic wildlife from exploitation. She came out of retirement briefly in 1992 to play an Ivana Trump-like character in the TV series Lady Boss. Mimieux is survived by her husband and five stepchildren.",Arts/Film,Yvette Mimieux obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/28/yvette-mimieux-obituary
