5/18/2022,"Sweden and Finland have formally submitted their applications to join Nato, in one of the biggest geopolitical consequences to date of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, personally accepted the Nordic neighbours’ membership applications at the headquarters of the 30-member, US-led defensive military alliance in Haren, in the north-east of Brussels. “I warmly welcome the requests by Finland and Sweden to join Nato. You are our closest partners,” Stoltenberg said, hailing the occasion as “a historic step” and “a good day at a critical time for our safety”. Sweden’s ambassador to Nato, Axel Wernhoff, and his Finnish colleague Klaus Korhonen handed over the application letters from the two Nordic countries, signed by their respective foreign ministers, shortly after 8am on Wednesday. The Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, and the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, are due to travel to Washington on Thursday to meet the US president, Joe Biden, for talks on their countries’ application and European security more broadly. “The security interests of all allies have to be taken into account and we are determined to work through all issues and reach rapid conclusions,” Stoltenberg said. “All allies agree on the importance of Nato enlargement. We all agree that we must stand together and we all agree that this is an historic moment which we must seize.” Nato ambassadors are expected to discuss the applications on Wednesday and could give the green light on opening formal talks with the pair on their requests. However, the accession process requires the unanimous approval of all the alliance’s members and Turkey has already said it will not support the applications. Nato accession – including ratification by all member states – usually takes between eight and 12 months, but the alliance has said it wants to move quickly given the threat from Russia hanging over the Nordic countries’ heads. Canada has said it expects to ratify Finland and Sweden’s accession protocol within a few days. Ankara says its objections are based on what is describes as Sweden and Finland’s support for members of Kurdish militant groups, and their decisions in 2019 to impose arms export embargos on Ankara over Turkey’s military operations in Syria. Helsinki, Stockholm and the other western allies have said they are optimistic they can overcome Turkey’s objections. Many analysts believe the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who faces elections next year, is seeking concessions for domestic political advantage and is unlikely ultimately to veto the applications. Andersson and Niinistö told a joint press conference in Stockholm on Monday that the Nordic neighbours, which have abandoned decades of military non-alignment in the wake of Russia’s onslaught on Ukraine, would go through the accession process “hand in hand”. The Finnish parliament voted overwhelmingly on Monday to back the Helsinki government’s decision to apply for Nato membership, while Andersson confirmed on Monday after a parliamentary debate in Stockholm that Sweden would do likewise. Finland shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia and has maintained strict policies of neutrality then non-alignment since the end of the second world war, viewing Nato membership as a provocation of Moscow. Sweden has stayed out of military alliances, and has not fought a war, for more than 200 years. However, Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February has led to a profound change in both countries’ thinking, with public support for Nato accession in Finland trebling to about 75% and surging to between 50% and 60% in Sweden.",News/World news,Sweden and Finland formally apply to join Nato,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/sweden-and-finland-formally-apply-to-join-nato
5/18/2022,"An audit has found there are “systemic failures” in how Victorian police treat complaints by Aboriginal people, with more than 40% of the files examined revealing indicators of bias on the part of investigators. The Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (Ibac) audited 54 complaints and serious incident files involving Aboriginal people, which were closed by Victoria police in 2018. Of the 41 complaints, almost half (46%) related to the use of force or assaults by police, often during an arrest, while 21% concerned human rights breaches, 11% duty failures and 10% improper language or harassment. Only three complaints, or roughly 7%, were substantiated, two of which concerned inappropriate language and the third duty failure. No complaint alleging assault was substantiated. By way of comparison, a 2018 Ibac audit of complaints investigated by Victoria police’s internal watchdog, the Professional Standards Command, had a substantiation rate of 19%. “The persistence of extremely low substantiation rates is a significant deterrent to Aboriginal people making complaints about police, and can undermine efforts to build trust and confidence in the police complaints system among Aboriginal people,” the report, released on Wednesday, said. Ibac found 41% of files audited contained indicators of bias on the part of investigators, including by minimising the seriousness of allegations, downplaying officers’ conduct, making inappropriate comments about witnesses and scrutinising the complainant’s background or criminal history. Twenty-two per cent of files indicated bias or lack of impartiality with respect to the police officers involved. This included dismissing complainants’ concerns, implying that the complainant was not truthful, and commenting on previous irrelevant interactions with them. Ibac disagreed with the choice of investigator in 45% of the files it audited, whether because of a conflict of interest, a relevant complaint history or for other reasons. Commissioner Robert Redlich said the findings indicate “systemic failures” within Victoria police’s complaints handling processes. “Police misconduct and the investigation of complaints against police are issues that concern all Victorians, but they have particular significance for Aboriginal people who come into contact with police at a much higher rate than non-Aboriginal people. Despite this, Aboriginal people make very few complaints about police,” he said. “Ibac recognises how challenging it can be to make a complaint about suspected corruption or police misconduct. There may be social, economic or cultural barriers to speaking up and Ibac understands that making a complaint may be a difficult or confronting experience. “Ensuring such complaints and serious incidents are investigated thoroughly and fairly is one way to help build trust in Victoria Police.” Forty-one per cent of the files examined by Ibac involved Aboriginal children and young people aged 17 or younger. Many of these files involved incidents occurring during arrest, though several also raised issues about the treatment of, and care provided to, Aboriginal young people in custody. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In some instances, it was unclear whether a family member, support person or advocate was contacted when a young person was arrested or if they were present when they were interviewed by police. Welfare checks were also not conducted in an appropriate or timely way. “Victoria Police’s investigation of complaints related to these matters failed to identify these issues or recommend any action on the identified deficiencies,” the report reads. Concerns with complaint handling systems and processes were also identified in the report, including how Aboriginal status was recorded, a failure to keep the complainant updated on the process of the investigation and conflicts of interest being poorly identified and managed. Redlich also noted the failures were “longstanding”, given previous Ibac reports have identified similar issues. Ibac’s report makes 10 recommendations for Victoria police including the establishment of a dedicated process for handling complaints by Aboriginal people. Nerita Waight, chief executive of the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, said the report findings are “not new to us or Ibac and will not be remedied until police stop investigating police”. “We have asked the government to implement an independent complaints body because we know that the culture within the police force does not allow for proper investigations of police complaints,” she said. A spokesperson for Victoria police said it notes the findings contained in Ibac’s report and will take time to consider and respond to the recommendations. “Victoria police is committed at all levels to achieving better outcomes for Aboriginal people in Victoria. We will continue to work to ensure the voices of our First Nations people are heard,” she said.",News/Australia news,Audit finds ‘systemic failures’ in how Victorian police treat Indigenous complaints,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/audit-finds-systemic-failures-in-how-victorian-police-treat-indigenous-complaints
5/18/2022,"Ten years ago, I made a documentary about gay footballers, inspired by my uncle, Justin Fashanu, the first openly gay British footballer. My uncle’s career was marred by homophobia and racism both on and off the pitch. He died by suicide in 1998. My film unearthed a litany of systemic barriers to making football a more open and welcoming place. My uncle was desperate to pave the way for others in the game to live authentically. The news about the Blackpool player Jake Daniels coming out has shown just how different the world is now. There has been an outpouring of love and support for Daniels in the press and across social media – something that would have been hard to imagine in days gone by. Change may not have come as quickly as we had hoped, but Daniels’ experience shows we’re on the right path. Recent years have seen a collective rejection of injustice in all its forms. We’ve marched for George Floyd and players have taken the knee in support of Black Lives Matter. The real test will now be how fans adapt. As more and more sportspeople open up about their mental health and personal struggles, supporters have too often lagged behind in accepting this new status quo. The tide is turning on these bigoted views and, by hook or by crook, we will reach zero tolerance. Football has always been a tight-knit community. Even when Justin came out in the 1990s, his teammates rallied around him. As part of my uncle’s legacy, the Justin Fashanu Foundation counsels players suffering from discrimination, including those who are ashamed or scared to speak publicly about their sexuality. I have always had the utmost respect for their privacy, and will continue to advocate for them even if they haven’t found their voice yet. But I want to keep campaigning so that future generations won’t even need to ask themselves whether it’s safe to come out and be who they are. I don’t want any player to feel like they have to live a double life on and off the pitch. I often tell players that it is a safer time to be gay than in my uncle’s day. There is always more to be done to tackle homophobia and racism, and it would be foolish to claim we live in a world of sunshine and rainbows – especially when Stonewall research shows that 72% of football fans have heard homophobic abuse. But where we are succeeding is in creating space for these conversations to happen, so that when footballers do come out, which they will continue to do, people are already mindful that gay footballers exist. I promised Justin I would keep doing this job until a Premiership player comes out. Daniels plays for the Championship, so we’re nearly there, and I hope in the next years we will see a gay Premiership footballer embraced by the nation. We know they exist. Daniels wasn’t one of the footballers we were supporting, but his bravery will inspire others who are still in the closet. They will be carefully taking in today’s reactions, analysing attitudes, watching fans and judging the atmosphere. Hopefully, in time, they will see that they too can be their authentic selves. We owe them that. We could be missing out on the next Cristiano Ronaldo because he’s gay and doesn’t want to come out – how can that happen? This year has shown we are ready to stamp homophobia out of football – maybe not completely, but we are as ready as we’ve ever been.

5/18/2022,"Kamada’s creativity It will be crucial for Rangers to keep a close eye on Daichi Kamada in the final third. The Japanese playmaker is a lovely, silky player and was impressive when Eintracht Frankfurt saw off West Ham in the last four. Even Declan Rice found it difficult to pin Kamada down when Eintracht won the first leg at the London Stadium. West Ham never seemed to know what to do with Kamada, who plays as one of the two attacking midfielders in Oliver Glasner’s 3-4-2-1. He had a role in Eintracht’s opening goal, was in the right place to tap home the winner after Djibril Sow’s shot was saved and was unlucky to see a deflected shot hit the woodwork during the final stages, so Rangers will need to keep a close eye on the 25-year-old. If Kamada is given too much space to dribble inside from the left and play clever passes then Rangers will be in trouble. Borré dropping deep Eintracht’s Colombian forward Rafael Borré is a very clever player. Borré lacks physicality but his movement is smart and he is adept at linking the play. He knows when to pull away from markers to receive a pass and make space for others. Rangers need to be careful of the runners. Borré is unlikely to stay in a central position all the time. He drifts a lot and lets Eintracht’s attacking midfielders run past him. It was Jens Petter Hauge, who can fill in if the dangerous Jesper Lindstrøm is unavailable, who made a diagonal run to reach a long ball during the move that led to West Ham’s Aaron Cresswell being sent off at Deutsche Bank Park. The wing-backs Eintracht’s system gives them a different dimension and suits their squad. Above all it brings two of their most important players into the picture. Wing-backs are crucial for a side using a back three and Eintracht’s are excellent. The left flank is patrolled by Filip Kostic, who used his hammer of a left foot to score twice when the Bundesliga side stunned Barcelona at the Camp Nou in the quarter-finals, and Ansgar Knauff is an electrifying presence on the right. Knauff, a 20-year-old German on loan from Borussia Dortmund, has pace to burn and loves contributing to the attack, as he demonstrated by heading in Borré’s cross after 49 seconds when Frankfurt beat West Ham in London. Rangers will need to pin down both wing-backs. Their fans They are loud, passionate and will travel in numbers. They give the team extra strength. Issues in possession Eintracht are a good reactive side. Their speed makes them very effective on the break and they have shown during this run that they are capable of absorbing pressure. Evan Ndicka is a very good defender and will be even more important with Martin Hinteregger missing. Kevin Trapp is an outstanding goalkeeper. But there could be problems for Eintracht if Rangers play a more cautious game and make themselves difficult to break down. The German team do not look as convincing when the onus is on them to attack. Their home record is poor this season. They have won only twice at home since Christmas, which is a surprising given that the atmosphere is one of the best in Europe. Set pieces Eintracht’s set pieces are not particularly dangerous and it was a surprise that West Ham did not hurt them more from dead-ball situations. It was one of Eintracht’s biggest concerns when they faced David Moyes’s side. They were worried about being overpowered and there was a glaring lack of organisation when West Ham equalised during the first leg, Kurt Zouma rising unchallenged to head across goal and the unmarked Michail Antonio scoring at the far post. However West Ham’s delivery was not good enough for much of the tie. Trapp relieved a lot of pressure by commanding his area and claiming a lot of crosses, though Eintracht were not entirely comfortable when playing against 10 men in the second leg. West Ham were allowed some decent headed chances but were not accurate enough. A lack of incision Eintracht do not have a top No 9. Borré does plenty of good work but has scored only 11 goals this season. Gonçalo Paciência has struggled. Kamada, Lindstrøm and Hauge have had low-scoring campaigns. The encouraging thing for Eintracht is that they share the goals around; the worry for them is that they do not have enough ruthless finishers.",Sport/Football,Eintracht Frankfurt: their weaknesses and where they could hurt Rangers,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/18/eintracht-frankfurt-weaknesses-strengths-rangers-europa-league-final
5/18/2022,"Shoppers are changing their behaviour as family budgets come under pressure from swingeing price rises on basic necessities, from milk and cooking oil to dog food. Jane Jones, who works in a supermarket in Flintshire, Wales, says cash-strapped customers are looking for ways to cut back. “It’s completely different in the shop. There are some people that don’t have to worry about money but the average person is spending less and people are always complaining about prices at the checkout. Some people know when [the store] puts out reductions. They come to the store at 8pm and you can see crowds of people at the reductions counter climbing over each other to get what’s cheap. When there is something in the aisles that is on offer, people buy what’s cheap that week and don’t have it the next. We used to get shoplifters stealing high-value things to sell on, which is not uncommon. Now it’s people stealing everyday things, doing their weekly shop and trying to walk out without paying. Baby milk has never been security tagged but now it is, so people can’t steal it. It was something that never would happen before but people are quite desperate. There is a lot going [missing] through self-service: people not scanning everything is more prevalent than it was. There are definitely a number of things that never had security tags before but have got them now. A lot of things have been removed off the shelves. We put cards out for things such as printer ink and you have to go and get it from a secure area. A lot of people do say “when you get to £40 can you stop”, and then we look at their offers to see if they can buy more. You can see them prioritising what they need at the front [of the conveyor belt]. There have always been people who shop like that, who only have a certain amount of money to spend. It is not a new thing but it is definitely happening more with people who didn’t generally bother before and were carefree and just buying what they needed or wanted. Now people are very cautious about cost. The supermarket has value lines and [premium] lines and people tend to pick up more value brands now, which was something they seemed to be stopping doing a while ago. We find lots of things left at the end of the checkout – people are thinking they shouldn’t have picked it up and changed their mind. It must be hard for them but we don’t make them feel bad. We are in the same boat, we understand as we are not in high-paid roles. I try to shop smart. I spend a lot of time in the supermarket so I see the offers and buy fewer treats, such as the odd bottle of wine. You don’t plan meals around what you like but what you can afford to buy, what’s on Bogof (buy one, get one free) or reduced. Everything seems to have gone up in price a little bit. Some things, such as cat food, have gone up massively. When you are going around it’s maybe 5p here and 10p there but when you get to the checkout with 50 items in the trolley, that is a lot of money.”",News/Business,A view from the checkout: ‘now it’s people stealing everyday things’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/18/a-view-from-the-checkout-now-its-people-stealing-everyday-things
5/18/2022,"“I’ve just seen that Scott Arfield of Rangers has made 100 league appearances for four different clubs (Falkirk, Huddersfield, Burnley and Rangers). Is this a record, or has someone done this with five,” ponders Jesse Pajwani. Tom Ayres would like to add three other names to the 4 x 100 club. “Alan Ball matched this feat at Blackpool, Everton, Arsenal and Southampton,” writes Tom. “Graham Alexander has appeared in the league more than 150 times for four clubs: Scunthorpe, Luton, Preston and Burnley. Tony Ford brought his century up four times, for Grimsby, Stoke City, West Bromwich Albion and Mansfield.” Kieran Whooley offers the great sleight-of-hip merchant Chris Waddle, who reached three figures for Newcastle, Spurs, Marseille and Sheffield Wednesday. But there is at least one man who has made 100 league appearances for five clubs. A number of you mentioned Peter Shilton, who belongs to the rare breed of journeymen who were also all-time greats. He reached a century at Leicester, Stoke, Nottingham Forest, Southampton and Derby County. And, as Tom points out, he also won a record 125 caps for England. “It’s been 100 league matches since Leyton Orient scored a penalty,” tweets Chris Walsh. “Is that a record? If not, what’s the longest such run?” In 2018 we touched on the longest spells in which teams haven’t even been awarded a spot-kick, as opposed to actually scoring one. But Orient’s current dry spell in the box doesn’t appear to be a record – even in London. “Crystal Palace went 148 league games (and 154 games in total) without scoring a penalty from 5 October 1946 to 11 March 1950,” tweets Calciocassini. “Unlikely that this is the longest such run. Palace also had a run of 118 league games (128 in all) without scoring a penalty from September 1964 to August 1967, went crazy with a run of three in 10 games, before going on another 99-game run (119 in all) from October 1967 to February 1970. This was around the time I started attending Palace matches and I remember wondering if I would ever see us score a penalty.” After enduring all those droughts, we sincerely hope you were at Selhurst Park on Easter Monday 1989. “Is Ruben Loftus-Cheek the first substitute to be substituted in the FA Cup final?” asks Steve Pye. The aptly numbered Ruben Loftus-Cheek (12) came on for Chrisian Pulisic at half-time in extra-time on Saturday, before being replaced by Ross Barkley for the penalty shootout. But he didn’t make unwanted FA Cup final history. A similar thing happened to another Chelsea player, Arjen Robben, in the 1-0 victory over Manchester United in 2007. Robben came on for Joe Cole at half-time in normal time but suffered an injury in extra-time and was replaced by another Cole, Ashley. It was his last appearance for the club. So the record belongs to Robben, though Loftus-Cheek remains the first to be taken off because of his penalty history. “Aleksandar Mitrovic’s goal tally in the Championship this season is 43 but I wonder which player has scored most goals overall in football’s second tiers,” wonders Bogdan Kotarlic. Steve Hyde would like to open the bidding on this one. With 128 goals, Billy Sharp is The Championship's all time highest scorer. There may well be others who can beat the record from before it was called that, or indeed in the second tiers of overseas leagues, but that's your marker to beat And, er, the Justin Horton Show may well have closed it. @TheKnowledge_GU Brian Clough scored 251 goals in the second flight It was actually 250 – one of his goals came in the First Division, just before his retirement through injury at the age of 29 – though that will still take some beating. Of course, we wouldn’t say Brian Clough was the best second-tier goalscorer of all time. But he might have been in the top one. “Can you clear up who actually first uttered ‘If he’s not interfering with play, what’s he doing on the pitch’? Was it Shankly, or Blanchflower, or neither of the above,” enquired Steve Antrobus in 2004. “In the last few weeks of debate I have seen various reports attributing the quote to both. I am a Spurs fan but I have refrained from sticking my neck out and claiming it as Blanchflower’s … so far!” And it’s a good job Steve did, as neither Bill nor Danny could rightly take the credit for such insight (something today’s rule-making suits would do well to listen to and discuss over their grande double-decaf skinny latte triple frappucinos). But you will be glad to hear your right to bask in reflected Spurs glory has not been entirely denied, as the coiner of the much-quoted phrase was in fact White Hart Lane legend Bill Nicholson in his days as manager at the club – and not, as some Scouse quarters would have you believe, Bill Shankly. Shankly’s wordy take on the situation was in fact: “If a player is not interfering with play or seeking to gain an advantage, then he should be.” Which, we think you will agree, is completely different. “How many clubs worldwide have won the league title in their centenary year and which was the first?” asks Masai Graham. Tennis superstar Rafael Nadal has often scheduled his matches to allow him to watch Real Madrid games.Have there ever been football teams which have requested to move their match times because their players wanted to watch an event in a different sport? “Who’s the oldest player to win their first Premier League or Champions League medal?

5/18/2022,"Should one spend one’s brief time on Earth guided by hedonism and pleasure, or by morality and responsibility? The second instalment of Elif Batuman’s chronicle of Selin, a student of Russian literature at Harvard in the 1990s whose biography corresponds fairly closely to the writer’s own, takes as its title Søren Kierkegaard’s first book, which suggests that one must choose whether to live according to ethical or aesthetic principles. For Selin, now in her sophomore year and with an unsatisfactory, perplexing quasi-relationship with mathematics student Ivan apparently behind her, the real issue seems not so much how to make a choice between two starkly opposed systems, but how to start living at all. Kierkegaard is not Selin’s only template: as in Batuman’s preceding novel, The Idiot, and her nonfiction book, The Possessed, works of literature exist, variously, as vast mansions in which to wander, marvelling at the ingenuity and beauty of the fixtures and fittings; unexpectedly capricious haunted houses, in which mirrored doors open on to dead-end corridors and distorted reflections; and, occasionally and disappointingly, arid thought experiments, destined to trap the reader in repetitive and unyielding arguments. In the course of Either/Or, Selin finds herself in agitated dialogue with André Breton’s Nadja. “I started keeping a running record in my notebook of everything in Nadja that seemed related to any of my problems,” Selin explains, before pondering the possibility of writing a concordance to the novel in the manner of Nabokov’s Pale Fire. “I knew that nobody would want to read such a book; people would die of boredom.” Later, she takes herself off to her student bunk to read Proust, and weeps at the thought that, like him, she will spend much of her life repairing to bed early and minutely dissecting his memories. Why, she wonders, does Proust have to keep thinking about this stuff? “Why couldn’t he write a book about something else?” Selin’s creative dilemma – that she wants not only to read but to write novels – is accompanied by other “real-life” complications. One is how to reconcile the Turkish and American parts of her heritage and upbringing, as the daughter of divorced parents who has grown up in New Jersey, but travelled each summer to see her family in Ankara; she often bristles at how cultures and places outside the US are subjected to its lens, and at how ignorant Americans appear to be of their own blinkers. She must also navigate the profound weirdnesses of her fellow students and, perhaps most pressingly, experience her first kiss. In terms of writing, she suspects that there’s something more to creating fiction than simply titivating one’s own observations and daily life, that some form of literary alchemy must take place (though she’s not always convinced that the supposedly great writers have achieved it). As Leonard, her creative writing tutor, points out to a classmate whose short story sounds depressingly pedestrian and strikingly similar to his own life, it’s fine if you want to write about not being able to get laid, but you have to take the reader with you. Batuman’s success in Either/Or is how thoroughly she exploits the gap between Selin’s scepticism about the creation and the consequences of literature and her narrator’s wonderfully idiosyncratic comic voice. While Selin is worrying over how to marshal the fragments of existence into writing, she is tossing off one-liner after one-liner, her tone ranging from the lugubrious to the withering. When her friend Svetlana encourages her to see a therapist to process her confusion and grief about Ivan, she reflects that Svetlana’s own counsellor “was just the kind of jocular Socratic advice-implier I didn’t want to hear from”. Of another friend, Jeremy, who is in love with two girls named Diane, she notes that “even though he talked about the Dianes constantly, he didn’t seem incapacitated; he always had the strength to pivot to his other favourite topic, which was the works of Thomas Pynchon”. Perhaps I’m projecting, but I felt that an entire lifetime of talking to men about books was encapsulated there. Selin’s tendency to bounce between such shrewd character assessments and complete naivety is also charming, even when it borders on the far-fetched. Her disbelief at the sheer oddness and pointlessness of the mechanics of sex, which she apprehends as a rite of passage she must endure rather than enjoy, is so wholeheartedly deployed that one feels all the reading of Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther will not make a dent; similarly, her Ivan-shaped heartbreak is likely to remain resistant to even the most detailed scrutiny of Pushkin’s Eugene Onegin. Although it’s a form of literature that Selin doesn’t mention, her story has much in common with the picaresque; episodic in structure, filled with acquaintances, misadventures and strangers whose motives are questionable, it is meandering rather than propulsive. Batuman thinks nothing, for example, of taking three pages to describe Selin’s reaction to listening to the Fugees, or to reading Martin Amis’s The Rachel Papers, which, fairly predictably, a male friend has suggested to her – she comes to the astute and pithy conclusion that it is better to be the writer than the written about. Either/Or does not exactly conclude; rather, a third volume seems almost inevitable, given that Selin appears to be leaving Kierkegaard and Breton to one side as she embarks on a reading of Henry James’s The Portrait of a Lady. Sex has also entered the frame. Spending her summer updating student guidebooks, Selin seems suddenly struck by the idea that conveying information plainly – “Hearty sandwiches. Hot dishes” – might be just as useful, and indeed truthful, as the greatest literature. From the vantage point of greater age, one might point out that it is not an either/or situation, and perhaps Selin’s further adventures will help her appreciate that.

5/18/2022,"Colonial and Confederate statues toppled. Looted objects returned by contrite museums. Tainted family names such as Sackler expunged from buildings. A worldwide reckoning with the past crimes of great powers is under way. But is there a glaring omission? A new book, Nazi Billionaires, investigates how Germany’s richest business dynasties made fortunes by aiding and abetting Adolf Hitler’s Third Reich. It also examines how, eight decades later, they still escape close scrutiny and a nation that has done so much to confront its catastrophic past still suffers a very particular blind spot. “What struck me was this is a country that’s so cognisant of its history in many ways but seemingly the most economically powerful actors do not engage with that,” says author David de Jong, a 35-year-old Dutchman. “That was the reason why I wrote the book. It’s an argument in favour of historical transparency.” The former reporter for Bloomberg News examines German companies that own beer brewers and wine producers as well as famous US brands such as Krispy Kreme and Pret A Manger. But he casts an especially harsh light on car makers led by household names such as BMW and Porsche, which powered the postwar economic miracle and contribute about a 10th of the nation’s gross domestic product. De Jong tells how the rise of the Nazis was initially met with scepticism and contempt by many business leaders but some discovered it could be very profitable. Ferdinand Porsche convinced Hitler to put the Volkswagen Beetle into production. The company thrived under his son, Ferry Porsche, who volunteered for the SS, became an officer and lied about it for the rest of his days. Ferry Porsche designed the first Porsche sports car and surrounded himself with former SS members in the 50s and 60s. The steel, coal and arms magnate Friedrich Flick was convicted at Nuremberg of using forced and slave labour, bankrolling the SS and looting a steel factory. But he was released in 1960 and eventually became controlling shareholder of Daimler-Benz, then Germany’s biggest car manufacturer. Deutsche Bank bought the Flick conglomerate in 1985, turning his descendants into billionaires. Perhaps no one better encapsulates de Jong’s argument than Günther Quandt and his son Herbert Quandt, members of the Nazi party and patriarchs of the family that now dominates the BMW Group. Herbert Quandt had responsibility over battery factories in Berlin where thousands of forced and enslaved labourers toiled, including hundreds of women from concentration camps. He acquired companies stolen from Jews in France and used prisoners of war and forced labourers on his own private estate. He even built a concentration subcamp in Nazi-occupied Poland. When Günther Quandt was 37 and widowed, he met and married a 17-year-old called Magda Friedländer and had one child with her. After their divorce, Magda married the Nazi propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, with whom she murdered their six children before both killed themselves in 1945. After the war, Günther Quandt was arrested for suspected collaboration with the Nazis, only to be acquitted after falsely claiming that he had been forced to join the party by Goebbels. “Günther Quandt becomes one of Nazi Germany’s most most successful industrialists,” de Jong, who has been reporting on the families for a decade, said in a phone interview from Palm Springs, California. “He was already immensely wealthy before Hitler seized power. He uses it at the end of the war as a way of saying, ‘I was a victim of persecution. I was persecuted by Joseph Goebbels and by my ex-wife.’” Herbert Quandt inherited vast wealth from his father and saved BMW from bankruptcy, becoming the company’s biggest shareholder. Two of his children, Stefan Quandt and Susanne Klatten, are now Germany’s wealthiest family, with close to majority control of the BMW Group, large holdings in the chemical and technology industries and a net worth of about $38bn. They and other dynasties are celebrated for turning Germany into an economic powerhouse, with buildings, foundations and prizes bearing their names. The skeletons in their cupboards are not a secret – but nor are they well known or accounted for. Acknowledgment remains an afterthought despite Germany’s much-vaunted remembrance culture. Some have taken baby steps towards transparency. The Quandts commissioned a study in 2011 to look into their shameful past. Changes have been made to corporate websites but only, de Jong charges, grudgingly and incrementally, with important details omitted. Stefan Quandt still gives out an annual media prize named after his father and works from headquarters named after his grandfather. De Jong, who found family members unwilling to be interviewed other than one London-based heir, says: “You have BMW and Porsche, particularly the families that control them, conduct this whitewashing or leaving out of history where they celebrate the business successes of their founders or saviours but leave out the fact that these men committed war crimes. “I never got an answer whether it’s because they are afraid it would hurt the bottom line or share prices of the companies to be fully transparent about the history, or whether it’s just because they derive their entire identity from the successes that their fathers and grandfathers had and, by being transparent about them, it’s kind of disavowing their own identity. It’s probably a combination of both.” The families tend to lean on Germany’s notion of collective guilt, de Jong continues. “But it’s very perverse, where you now have the BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt, which has a model to inspire responsible leadership in the name of a man who, yes, saved BMW from bankruptcy in 1959, but also designed and built and dismantled a concentration subcamp in Nazi-occupied Poland. At a bare minimum what we can expect from these companies and families is historical transparency.” In his book, de Jong notes that an international drive for such transparency, and its attendant reckonings, have brought down statues of Confederate generals, slave traders and Christopher Columbus and heralded the rechristening of colleges named after racist presidents. “Yet this movement toward facing the past is somehow bypassing many of Germany’s legendary businessmen,” he writes. “Their dark legacy remains hidden in plain sight. This book, in some small way, tries to right that wrong.” The author, now based in Tel Aviv, Israel, adds: “I hope people will become more aware on a consumer level that the money they spend on these products might end up as dividends for these families and might go towards the maintaining of foundations, corporate headquarters and media properties in the name of Nazi war criminals. “I think people should be more aware of these histories and of history in general, particularly when it comes to consumption and the continuing whitewashing of history by these consumer brands and families that control them.” Nazi Billionaires is out now",Arts/Books,‘People should be more aware’: the business dynasties who benefited from Nazis,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/18/nazi-billionaires-book-hitler-bmw-porsche
