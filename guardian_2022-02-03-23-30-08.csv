2/3/2022,"Some lockdown art is inspiring. Mike Nelson’s The Book of Spells, (A Speculative Fiction) is not. Only one person at a time can experience this tiny installation. As the gallerist shuts the door from the outside – was that a key turning? – you are left all alone in a monument to loneliness. The protagonist of this fabulist installation lives in a single room with barely enough space for the iron bed frame on which they apparently spent month after month. A window opens on to a sealed space full of rubble. A child’s forgotten ball sums up the apocalyptic wasteland out there. And in here, the only signs of physical sustenance are a dried squash, an animal bone and a jar of matter that might be seeds or poison. Otherwise the small cupboard is bare. What has the occupant of the room been living on? Dreams of travel. The prison-like bed is surrounded by roughly knocked together wooden bookcases loaded with copies of Rough Guides and Lonely Planets – hundreds of them – plus maps and the occasional Dorling Kindersley volume, the ones that have nice colour pictures of beaches, artworks and local dishes. These are all practical guidebooks, the kind that so many of us stuffed in our hand luggage on the budget flights that made globetrotting so popular up to early 2020.  Nelson’s poor, locked-down wretch can’t let go of those days. So obsessed with weekend breaks in European cities is this person, that he or she whiles away the confined days and nights reading about good cheap hotels in Paris and the best pizzas in Budapest. There are, I counted, 22 guides on Prague alone. Portugal is shelved next to Africa, and there’s a bookcase just for Indonesia and Australasia. Israel gets two volumes and there are plenty on Turkey and Istanbul, whose imaginary subterranean souks Nelson fabricated in a delirious installation at the Venice Biennale in 2011. For this world in a bottle is also a microcosm of Nelson’s ambitious early works. It takes him back to Matt’s Gallery in London, where he first staged his sprawling labyrinth The Coral Reef back at the start of the millennium. That installation led you through room after room of a sinister urban underworld that seemed on the eve of some kind of catastrophe. Maybe in returning to Matt’s to construct a similarly doom-laden inscape he feels vindicated. After all, the 21st century has turned out to be even worse than The Coral Reef made it look. Nelson may once have seemed to be overdoing his heavy metal prophecies. Now he’s just telling it like it is. Who would have thought we would live in a time when travel guides, instead of acting as cheery holiday accessories, would summon stress and dread? The books arrayed here don’t open up possibilities but remind us of experiences closed off by lockdown: the flights not taken. Yet as you stare at the four walls that surround you, the satire metamorphoses into a story of paralysis and delusion. Nelson’s ideal city appears to be Prague. Maybe those 22 books about it are a clue to what he’s doing here. In the great Prague author Franz Kafka’s story The Burrow, a mole delights in its cosy little subterranean home but then hears something trying to get in. The inhabitant of Nelson’s room would apparently love to get out – or would he/she? There’s a door, after all. There could be experiences available beyond it, even if they are local. Instead, this obsessive reader of travel books stays in a mouldering coffin, studying the same places, making the same plans. Perhaps they never did go anywhere, even before the pandemic – maybe this is the room of someone always consumed by fantasies of the trips that never were. So The Book of Spells could be a self-critique of Nelson’s own art, a rejection of his magic realism. Art too is like a travel book, offering us escape from the physical facts of reality. We go to the theatre, read a novel, see a film. Perhaps these are all just evasions, a few hours of holiday. In this closed room the holiday is getting threadbare. Classify those guidebooks as much as you like, you ain’t going nowhere. And when it’s all over, when we’re on the plane again increasing our carbon footprint, will it just be another evasion? If Nelson’s theatrical art used to be epic and entertaining, this is a Samuel Beckett one-acter, a grumpy howl from the heart of the pandemic. Perhaps it won’t be easy to understand in future, when it doesn’t hurt your head to look at guidebooks. But right now it slams the way we’ve been living in your face.

2/3/2022,"Public universities in Kandahar and Helmand provinces in Afghanistan have reopened after being closed for nearly nine months, with some female students joining classes. Despite calls from education activists and students, universities and high schools across Afghanistan stayed shut after their usual summer break as the Taliban came to power. High schools have since reopened, but only for boys.  The media were refused permission by the Taliban authorities to cover the universities’ opening ceremonies, but students in Kandahar yesterday said they were not optimistic about the future under the restrictions imposed on women since the Taliban takeover. None of the women were willing to be quoted, but Khalid Rashed, an economics student, said there was concern about the low numbers of female students. “I am happy about the reopening of the university, but women are still facing limitations. The question is that even after girls come to university to continue their education in the current situation, will the Taliban allow them to work after graduation?” he said, urging fellow Afghan men to support women in seeking their rights. On Sunday, the Taliban announced that classes will restart at public universities without any reference to women attending classes. But even as Kandahar and Helmand opened this week, other universities in the southern provinces of Zabul and Uruzgan remained shut. According to the former Afghan government’s education ministry, 10% of Kandahar University’s 12,000 students were women prior to the Taliban takeover. Since the Taliban’s takeover last August, girls in secondary education and above have not been allowed to attend schools or universities. The Taliban stated that they were preparing “special instructions” for the education of girls. A source in Kandahar University, who commented on the condition of anonymity, said that male and female classes have been separated. The source also added that female students have been asked to follow Islamic dress code. Previously, the Taliban’s spokesperson for the ministry for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice has told reporters that by Islamic dress code they mean burqa and Arabic-style black abaya.",News/Global development,Afghan universities reopen with strict rules for female students,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/03/afghan-universities-reopen-with-strict-rules-for-female-students
2/3/2022,"The government has been accused of “trashing” local democracy after overruling a council decision and approving the expansion of Bristol airport. An application by the airport to expand its capacity from 10 million to 12 million passengers a year was refused by North Somerset council at the beginning of 2021, but after the airport appealed, central government planners overturned the decision.  Three inspectors from the Planning Inspectorate conceded there remained “a significant level of opposition” to the plan and that their ruling would be “a major disappointment” to some. “In coming to our decision, the protests of individuals, communities, members of parliament, action groups, technical experts and others were fully heard and carefully considered by the panel,” the inspectors said. But they dismissed environmental effects, including on climate, air quality, biodiversity and the character of the surrounding Mendip hills, recognised as an area of outstanding natural beauty, as “neutral in the balance” of their decision-making. Campaigners have waged a three-year battle to try to block the airport expansion and had won the support of all local authorities in the area as well as most local MPs. Steve Clarke, of the Bristol Airport Action Network, said the inspectors’ report was “completely trashing any idea of local democracy being important in this instance”. He said: “This has completely ignored local decision-making … It completely ignores any impact it’s going to have on the climate.” Activists have calculated that the expansion would lead to an extra 1m tons of carbon emissions every year. The leader of North Somerset council, Don Davies, was quoted by Bristol 24/7 as saying: “This simply flies in the face of local democracy and disregards the views of the local communities who fought equally hard to resist the expansion.” The Avon and Bristol branch of CPRE, the Countryside Charity, said it was “devastated” by the decision. “The decision tramples on local democracy, makes a mockery of the UK’s Cop26 commitments and sets a precedent for other airport expansion plans,” it tweeted. Bristol airport is owned by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan. As well as an increase in flight quotas, the planning permission allows the airport to expand roads leading to the site, extend terminal buildings and build a new car park on land designated as green belt. On Thursday the airport published statements from local business groups backing the expansion. John Mayer, the local lead for the Federation of Small Businesses, said it would send a “strong signal that our region will continue to welcome trade, tourism, and investment from overseas.” Dave Lees, the chief executive of Bristol airport, said: “The decision is excellent news for our region’s economy, allowing us to create thousands of new jobs in the years ahead and provide more choice for our customers.”",News/UK news,Bristol airport expansion gets go-ahead as local council overruled,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/03/bristol-airport-expansion-gets-go-ahead-as-local-council-overruled
2/3/2022,"Many of the Indian releases that pivoted to streaming over the past 18 months have deserved burial-by-algorithm, if I’m being honest. One that doesn’t is the Tamil melodrama Karnan, an exceptionally vivid spot of latter-day mythmaking. You wonder whether writer-director Mari Selvaraj pitched it as “what if Baahubali” – the two-part SS Rajamouli epic that redrew the horizons of Indian commercial cinema back in 2015 – “but in the here-and-now?”. Enter our eponymous young hero (local megastar Dhanush), introduced completing a ritual that involves leaping off a rock overhanging a pool and, while still in mid-air, bisecting vermillion-daubed fish with a flashing blade. Lakes, swords: British viewers may be reminded of Camelot. Here’s another knight in search of a worthy cause.  Yet the surprise Selvaraj has for us – one of the biggest curveballs in any movie released this past year – is that this cause should be a fully integrated public transit system. This is a tale of two villages, one of which (Karnan’s native Podiyankulam) is dirt-poor, the other (neighbouring Melur) rich enough to afford its own bus stop. When the residents of Podiyankulam hike to Melur to catch the bus, they’re regarded with suspicion and sometimes outright contempt as outsiders taking up valuable space – a source of ongoing tension between the two communities. Selvaraj has taken us somewhere very specific to tell a story that is broadly universal: a story about tribalism, and how it’s now often tied up with issues of free movement. The film’s first half, however, serves chiefly to define its warrior-in-chief – and thus to demonstrate that appearances can prove deceptive. Karnan initially presents as a nice lad with sensible hair, ticking the first box of Indian movie heroism by being good to his put-upon mother (Janaki). Yet the characterisation is soon complicated. A drinker and a gambler, Karnan is less your typical masala maverick than a punk-in-waiting. He’s a hothead who spends this first hour getting into scraps, pushing away the one gal who’s crazy about him, and – in a pre-intermission sequence that must have been tremendous fun to shoot – single-handedly trashing one of those rackety old buses pootling between backwaters. (He does much the same to a police station just after the break.) This is a kid with fire in his belly – that’s what makes him such a hothead – yet while Selvaraj grasps these flames can be destructive, he also knows that in certain cases they’re exactly what’s required to effectuate real and lasting change. Sometimes, the movie posits, you have to burn down the whole rotten system and start again from scratch. The blazingly unpredictable hero is one reason Karnan emerges as such an unpredictable watch – it’s a morality play hitched to a genuine loose cannon. In the course of the film, Karnan will alienate family members and the wider village; at points, all we can cling to is the knowledge our boy seems unlikely ever to take the shit the penniless farmers around him have been forced to swallow for generations. Somewhere in the mix, there’s a standard-issue crowdpleaser: you glimpse it whenever Dhanush raises himself up to his full 5ft 5in (5ft 4½in, when wet) and sets about righting this world’s wrongs – wealth inequality, police brutality – to what you suspect would have been huge cheers from the cheap seats had the film’s theatrical run not been curtailed by Covid. But it’s been overlaid by an artistry and delicacy rarely observed in films of this scale: if not the full Rajamouli, then not a hundred miles away. Cinematographer Theni Eswar provides lustrous cutaways to the region’s flora and fauna. And his overhead shots are positively sculptural: men gathering in a field mowed to resemble a bull, lovers trysting by a heart-shaped pond. The world-building is elevated to the point where it begins to resemble cosmology, yet as we look upon this busy, tempestuous, hotly contested few acres of land, we realise it’s not so far removed from our own backyards. It could do with more lady in its lake, true: where the Baahubalis offered equal-opportunity mythos, the women here fall between spectators and damsels-in-distress. (It’s a Dhanush film, and some hierarchies may be harder to topple than others.) Yet Selvaraj makes enough genuinely bold, even radical choices elsewhere, not least amid the tense siege finale, to make one regret that Karnan got shuttled off to streaming mid-pandemic. This is a film that takes up a small, everyday struggle, then rides hell-for-leather to fill the screen entire with it. Karnan is available on Amazon Prime in the US and UK",Arts/Film,My streaming gem: why you should watch Karnan,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/karnan-my-streaming-gem-why-you-should-watch
2/3/2022,"This worldly comedy of love is an example of how Truffaut always aspired to something lighthearted with even a touch of Lubitschian comedy. But it’s a very 70s piece of work in its knowing and slightly louche celebration of male romantic conquest (it got a Hollywood remake directed by Blake Edwards with Burt Reynolds). Charles Denner plays Bertrand, a guy who loves all women with the passion of a connoisseur or a collector; at his funeral, the service is thronged with his female admirers.  This short was Truffaut’s first serious work (if you discount his initial student-exercise short film, A Visit), a 23-minute piece of startling confidence and maturity in which almost all of Truffaut’s themes are laid out: the innocence and guilt of childhood, young love, the scary mystery of sex, and the glory of cinema itself. Over a hot summer, five brattish lads are larking about – and start spying on a young woman (played by the future French movie icon Bernadette Lafont in her first role) and her boyfriend. The game turns nasty. The adventures of Truffaut’s alter ego Antoine Doinel came to an end in this fifth and final film in the Doinel series – after The 400 Blows (1959), the short Antoine and Colette (1962), Stolen Kisses (1968) and Bed and Board (1970), clips and outtakes from which surface here like flashes of memory. Doinel is now a thirtysomething guy, getting divorced from his wife and becoming tormented with Vertigo-ish obsessions with a woman who looks like his former partner. Jean-Pierre Léaud’s performance has become enigmatically reserved, prematurely aged in some way, but also frozen in youth, in the moment at which he became famous – the way celebrities tend to be. Truffaut wasn’t a natural at science-fiction – perhaps his most notable contribution to the genre was his acting cameo in Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind. And it has to be said that this movie – though much discussed in its day, and instrumental in elevating the Bradbury novel to classic status while making the title itself part of the language – maybe hasn’t aged all that well. In a future dystopia where all reading matter is forbidden, a firefighter whose job is incinerating books falls in love with a schoolteacher who has a secret copy of the Memoirs of Saint Simon. It creaks a bit. A period piece, starring Léaud in a non-Doinel role, it is based on a novel by Henri-Pierre Roché, who wrote Jules et Jim, another love-triangle story about the erotic poignancy of shared love. Léaud is the young French art critic Claude, fascinated by a young Englishwoman in Paris, Anne (Kika Markham), who introduces him to her sister , who instantly falls for Claude. The use of voiceover and journals gives a delicate, elegiac tone to this involved story of the human heart and its mysteries. Another of the Truffaut movies based on an American crime novel – in this case, by Cornell Woolrich, whose short story It Had to be Murder inspired Hitchcock’s Rear Window. It was also another to get a dodgy Hollywood remake: Original Sin, from 2001, starring Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie. Jean-Paul Belmondo plays a wealthy tobacco farmer who advertises for a mail-order bride and is entranced by the woman he gets, played by Catherine Deneuve, even though he is convinced that this was not the person who responded to the ad. The denouement shows Truffaut’s playful, gleeful love of thriller conventions. An unusual film in the Truffaut canon in that it’s a period drama with a literary flavour, and so close to the old-fashioned cinéma de papa, which Truffaut once made his name by deriding. At 20 years old, Isabelle Adjani made her breakthrough here as Adele Hugo, living in the 1860s with her celebrated father, Victor, on the island of Guernsey, where she has conceived a Hardyesque romantic obsession with a caddish British army officer played by the beautiful Bruce Robinson (later to direct Withnail and I). A desolate tale of doomed love, which Truffaut invests with mystery and tragedy. Perhaps the closest Truffaut came to the cinema of confrontation or shock, The Wild Child was arguably a forerunner to Herzog’s The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser. Drawn from a sensational and mythologised case history from 18th-century France, it is the story of a “wolf boy” who is discovered living a feral existence in the forest. A doctor takes it upon himself to show the boy the civilising influence of education. Léaud plays Victor, the wild child, and Truffaut himself plays the doctor. The film returns Truffaut to his keynote theme: the vulnerability and intensity of childhood. A steamy melodrama, almost an erotic thriller, evidently inspired by Tristan and Isolde, which appeared at the time to lack the indirectness and lightness of touch that features in the best of Truffaut. Gérard Depardieu plays a happily married provincial man who is astonished when a former lover, herself now married, moves in next door – Fanny Ardant. Their relationship had been painful and tempestuous and of course soon reignites in secret, leading to calamity and violence. Another playful pulp gem from Truffaut, again based on a Cornell Woolrich novel: a revenge thriller that is said to have paved the way for Tarantino’s Kill Bill. Truffaut created a great role for Jeanne Moreau as the woman whose husband was shot dead on their wedding day – and who sets out to get payback by murdering the original killer and his four associates, including Michel Bouquet and Michael Lonsdale. Was the original crime deliberate, or an accident? No matter. The fascination is in her serial-killer’s procedural, working her way through the list of the guilty and getting satisfaction even after being caught and sent to jail. This is the fourth in the Doinel series, and perhaps the strangest or the saddest. Antoine and his wife, Christine, are living together as man and wife: the domicile conjugal of the French title, which is of course is not conducive to an enticing movie. Naturally, Antoine is to stray, after they have a child together, forming an attachment to a Japanese woman, Kyoko (played by the Japanese model Hiroko Berghauer, wearing dresses created by her husband’s design firm). Antoine’s job at this stage is dyeing carnations for flower shops – and could there be a more pointed symbol of the shallow futility of art? One of Truffaut’s biggest commercial prestige hits – a tragicomedy set in occupied Paris in 1942, where the populace would save on heating bills by crowding into theatres and cinemas before getting the last metro home. A theatre company, with Catherine Deneuve as the leading lady and Gérard Depardieu the new young star, believes that the show must go on, despite Nazi oppression – and the Jewish director is hiding out in the theatre’s cellar from where he is shaping the productions in secret. The actors are up against one of the most hateful critics in movie history – an odious antisemitic collaborationist called Daxiat, based on the real-life pro-Nazi journalist Alain Laubreaux. The idea of the director hiding in the cellar, an artist working in secret, suppressed by fate, is not so far from Charles Aznavour’s piano player in Shoot the Pianist. Stolen Kisses is a late-breaking new wave gem, free-wheeling, improvisatory in feel; witty, flighty, dapper film-making that is self-aware in the most lighthearted way, but sometimes rather melancholy and wan. With its references to les évènements and the Henri Langlois row, it could be Truffaut’s most Godardian film. Antoine Doinel has left the army under a cloud, and is now a brooding misfit who in short order is hired and fired from a bizarre range of jobs such as private detective and TV repairman. He begins to fall in love with Christine, a young woman played by Claude Jade, but also has a farcical sexual experience with his employer’s wife, vampishly played by Delphine Seyrig. Doinel’s life is now at the romantic comedy stage. Surely one of Truffaut’s strangest and most distinctive films, atypical but also intensely personal and heartfelt – based on some short stories by Henry James. Truffaut himself plays Julien, a veteran of the first world war, who works at a newspaper writing obituaries and is obsessed with death – the death in action of his wartime comrades, whose fate he didn’t deserve to avoid, the death of more and more of his contemporaries, and, chiefly, the death of his wife, to whom he keeps a shrine in his house. A disastrous fire leads Julien to a certain young woman, Cécilia, played by Nathalie Baye, with whom love and death fuse in a kind of occult redemption. Truffaut returns with heartfelt passion to the theme of childhood, but here it is not seen through the lens of the past: these children’s lives are happening in the present day. There is an ensemble of children and young teens here, suffering abuse, loneliness and shame, but also experiencing rebellious fun and first love. It is an episodic movie giving us little glimpses of lives, sometimes cheekily melodramatic or sentimental, sometimes wildly implausible, but these comic elements offset the brutally real pain that mottles the movie like marble. Truffaut’s drama of amour fou is probably his most grownup depiction of love and sex: a movie conducted with suavity, subtlety and depth – despite the faintly preposterous or melodramatic nature of the story. Jean Desailly plays a literary celebrity called Pierre Lachenay who comes to Lisbon to lecture on Balzac and has a passionate fling with Nicole, an air-hostess (as flight attendants were quaintly known in those days) on his plane, who is staying at the same hotel – played by Françoise Dorléac. As their obsessive affair continues, sensuality turns into comedy and farce. At first brittle and elegant, the affair becomes compellingly tender as both reveal their vulnerability. Truffaut’s follow-up to The 400 Blows is based on the novel Down There, by Philadelphia crime author David Goodis, and shows his extravagant love of American pulp and American noir – a key article of faith for the French new wave. Charles Aznavour plays Charlie, the piano-player in a sleazy dive. His name is actually Edouard Saroyan, an internationally known classical concert pianist who abandoned his glittering career because of a terrible secret, and now he gets muddled up with lowlife and crime, due to the nefarious activities of his brother, with the Marxian name of Chico, played by Truffaut stalwart Albert Rémy. The scene where two mobsters abduct Charlie and his girlfriend Léna (Marie Dubois) and start gossiping among themselves is hilarious – especially when one confesses he used to wear his little sister’s silk knickers as a boy. And the weird Truffaut-esque keynote of unexpected innocence is established when a total stranger tells Chico: “There are more virgins here than in any other city.” Plenty of movies are said to be love letters to cinema, but pre-eminent has to be this raffish comedy, in French titled La Nuit Americaine, the resonant term for the lens filter used to make a daytime shot look like night. This is the farcical, even screwball story of a film being made. Truffaut plays the director, who has hired a highly strung Hollywood star called Julie Baker, played by Jacqueline Bisset. His leading male, played inevitably by Jean-Pierre Léaud, has got his fiancee hired on the crew, but she is about to run off with a British stuntman. Like Fellini, Truffaut loves the rootless intensity of the loves and friendships on a film set, in comparison with which the claims of families and spouses at home are very dull. Even the longueurs and frustrations of filming have a dramatic shape and purpose lacking in the drab and messy wasteland outside the studio. Cinema is like real life, only better. Truffaut’s marvellous autobiographical debut had a sublime freshness and candour – and with it he began his lifelong collaboration with Jean-Pierre Léaud, the child actor whom he recast as a version of himself, forever merging his own persona with Léaud in the public’s mind and also perhaps in Léaud’s mind. He was the 12-year-old Antoine Doinel, who, like Truffaut, is a delinquent, an unhappy kid from a troubled home. He steals things and bunks off, roaming around Paris with his mate, and, to explain his truancy, tells his teacher that his mother is dead. This lie is exploded when his mother and stepfather show up at the school and slap Antoine in front of the entire class. Finally, Antoine is sent to reform school from which he is to escape. Truffaut gives us the immortal sequence in which Antoine runs to the beach, having never before seen the sea, the final freeze frame showing the childlike face at the point of becoming a man. It is the eternal love triangle that feels as if it is happening right in the swinging-60s present moment (like Godard’s triple-header Bande à Part), but in fact is set before and after the first world war. Oskar Werner is Jules, a diffident young Austrian living in 1912 Paris. He befriends the more worldly Frenchman Jim, played by Henri Serre. Both men fall for the same bohemian, beautiful force of nature: Catherine, played by Jeanne Moreau, having persuaded themselves that she resembles a beautiful Greek sculpture that they have seen. When war breaks out, Jules and Jim must fight on opposite sides. Is Jules et Jim a secret queer love story? Or is their friendship an anti-war fable, Catherine symbolising what they have in common? Catherine is possibly a fatuous male creation, the original manic pixie dream girl, whose function is to showcase the men’s more substantial nobility. Yet perhaps her passion and restless unhappiness point up the essential flimsiness and mediocrity of these men. Moreau’s most remarkable scene comes when she insouciantly sings in front of Jules and Jim a song of her own composition, Le Tourbillon de la Vie, or The Whirl of Life, accompanied on the guitar by another of her lovers. She sings with a delicate, birdlike, non-fatale chirrup. And perhaps the film’s meaning resides in that idea of a fatal whirlwind. Catherine asks Jim to meet her in a cafe, and doesn’t show up. Later, she explains something about a hairdresser, and reveals she is marrying Jules. If she had made it to their date, and Jim had had the courage to get his proposal in first, would things have been different? Happier? Or even more unhappy? Do love and destiny hinge on something as random as a missed date? Catherine is missing from the title but she dominates the movie.",Arts/Film,François Truffaut’s 20 best films – ranked,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/francois-truffaut-20-best-films-ranked
2/3/2022,"You thought you had a challenging lockdown? Imagine this scenario. The onset of a global pandemic coincides with your first experience of living alone. You have just separated from your partner and are heartbroken. Your industry is wiped out by Covid and all your engagements are cancelled. Oh, and your OCD flares up. It sounds bad, right? But not so bad that Catherine Bohart didn’t think she couldn’t get some banging standup out of it. “I am, if anything, an oversharer,” she says. “I just say what happens to me, all of the time. And for the last two years, [lockdown’s] been what’s happening.”  The show, This Isn’t for You, opens at the Leicester comedy festival on 9 February. After last year’s festival “pivoted”, as they say, online, a successful Leicester event (it’s the UK’s second biggest comedy gathering behind Edinburgh) this time round will mark a significant staging post on the industry’s route back from Covid. It also launches a five-month tour for Bohart, whose career was in the ascendant until Covid put life on pause. Her two shows so far have made waves; the first, Immaculate, was released last year as part of Soho Theatre Live on Amazon Prime Video. Her face was familiar as one of Nish Kumar’s sidekicks onfrom TV’s The Mash Report, where she explained border issues in her native Ireland to a Sesame Street-style puppet, and offered a guide to being “the kind of immigrant British people don’t mind so much”. She was also one half of fringe comedy’s hippest couple, with fellow comic, Edinburgh best newcomer nominee Sarah Keyworth. In some parallel universe, Bohart’s next show might be about being coupled-up. “I was writing a show about my men-free life,” she says. “Because I live in a very queer bubble, I was dating a woman and we were moving into a house together. But I no longer live with that person, and this show is now about … well, heartbreak, and control.” It tells the story of her mental health journey through lockdown, but with laughs. “Because the lesson of the last few years,” says the 33-year-old, “is that the universe thinks it’s funny that we endeavour to control our lives.” The issue of control may be more critical to Bohart than most: she lives with – and once spent four months in hospital for – obsessive compulsive disorder. “Because of my OCD, I actually took to lockdown well,” she says. “I was amenable to being a little hamster person. Morning time, eating time, sleeping time, working time, then go again: I quite liked the patterns and rules and controls.” The problems started when the rules relaxed. “When everybody else was like: ‘We can go back out into the world!’ I was like: ‘Do we have to go back into the world?!’ It was quite confronting and I felt incredibly anxious.” Lockdown was also uniquely solitary for Bohart, who had hitherto “never spent any time alone”. And bereft, too: “Like all comedians, there was a 24-hour period where everything went. It was that dramatic: ‘Oh, there goes my next six months’ earnings.’” What sustained her (apart from a temping job and teaching via Zoom) was a weekly online show, Gigless, she put together while theatres were closed. “It gave me hope on two fronts,” she says. “One, comedians were funny – and it was a big thing to see that this hadn’t broken us. And two, having a loyal and excited 100 people every week watching my stuff. That gave me a sense that what I was doing was worthwhile.” Being a standup had never been Bohart’s plan. She grew up in Dublin, the daughter of a Catholic deacon – a relationship dissected in her 2018 debut. Comedy did not loom large: “We had only two channels on my TV until I was 18. I thought that three comics existed: Tommy Tiernan, Dylan Moran and Joan Rivers.” She trained to be an actor, but ended up temping for a property firm. She was 27 before she stepped behind a mic, encouraged by a group of female comics she had booked to perform at a corporate event. “They said: ‘You’re gobby. Are you like this when you’re sober? Do you want to come do a new material night?’ So I did.” Neither was it a deliberate choice, says Bohart, to mainline knotty intimacies in her work. “But anything except the truth feels like filler to me,” she says. “Maybe it’s being an Irish person? My experience of Irish people is an inability to do small talk. It’s like: ‘Hello, what’s your trauma? Do you want mine?’” The oversharing modus operandi also came about because “the stuff my early audiences found interesting was the stuff that had been difficult for me in my life. Suddenly, being a woman was a good thing, being a queer person was a good thing, being foreign and from a religious background and having a mental illness were good things – in terms of making me distinct and giving me something to talk about.” Bohart’s comedy ambitions are focused on simply getting funnier (“We all want that, right?”) and “being less questioning in my content”. “I’m often asking questions in my standup,” she says, “and not always answering them. And I want to. I think it’s an arrogance to stand on stage for an hour and not reach any conclusions. But I hope I’m decades away from being the best comic I’ll be.” Such are the aspirations of a comic now emerging from a Covid-era chrysalis, with a sitcom in the works, a tour on the starting blocks and a newfound zeal for the job she fell into. “After what we’ve been through,” says Bohart, “I am more excited to do comedy – but less confident it’s a certainty – than I’ve ever been. So I guess it’s just about enjoying it while it’s happening,” she concludes, happily abandoning control – “and about getting a pension, which I must remind myself to do.” Catherine Bohart: This Isn’t for You tours from 9 FebruaryWednesday until 5 June.",Arts/Culture,"Comedian Catherine Bohart: ‘When Covid hit it was, “there goes my next six months earnings’",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/03/comedian-catherine-bohart-when-covid-hit-it-was-there-goes-my-next-six-months-earnings
2/3/2022,"Mark Zuckerberg’s social media empire felt the full force of investors’ concerns about its growth prospects on Wednesday, as the revelation of Facebook’s first-ever drop in daily users helped trigger a share price rout. It was the first set of quarterly results for the parent company of Facebook under its new name, Meta. Here are some key points to take away from the figures and why Meta’s stock fell 20% in after-hours trading.  Facebook is Meta’s biggest app and it recorded its first fall in daily active users – a key growth metric – since the company was founded in 2004. Page 13 of this slide deck shows what happened: global daily users dropped from 1.93 billion in the third quarter of 2021 to 1.929 billion. It was led by a decline in users in Africa and Latin America, which is worrying for Meta because it needs to grow outside of its main market in the US, where growth fell too, albeit not for the first time. Last year a whistleblower, Frances Haugen, released internal documents that included presentations warning that Facebook was losing young users. One document revealed that “engagement is declining for teens in most western, and several non-western, countries”. Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder and chief executive, identified the video-sharing app TikTok as a key contributor to the user growth problem. “People have a lot of choices for how they want to spend their time, and apps like TikTok are growing very quickly,” he said on Wednesday’s earnings call. Chinese-owned TikTok has 1 billion users worldwide and is one of the reasons why Meta is struggling to compete in the market for young consumers. On the call, Zuckerberg said he was hopeful Facebook’s rival to TikTok, Reels, would help win back young users. “This is why our focus on Reels is so important over the long-term, as is our work to make sure that our apps are the best services out there for young adults.” In the meantime, however, it means slower revenue growth, he admitted. Meta makes 97% of its revenue from advertising, by building up profiles of its users that can then be matched to advertisers’ needs. So if an advertiser is looking for a consumer in a certain location, of a specific demographic and with certain hobbies, then Meta can direct those ads towards particular groups thanks to the data it has compiled about them. Meta said on Wednesday that recent changes with Apple’s iOS software for iPhones had hurt the business. Apple now requires users to give permission for companies such as Meta to gather data about them as they browse across the web. Unsurprisingly, users have said no thanks and it has made its ad targeting less effective. The company said on Wednesday that the hit to its revenues this year would be $10bn (£7.3bn) – about 8% of last year’s income at Meta. Sheryl Sandberg, Meta’s chief operating officer and architect of Facebook’s advertising strategy, said during an investor call on Wednesday that the company had ways of targeting users with less data. “There are also a lot of things that small businesses and large businesses can do to take advantage of the many targeting and measurement tools we have,” she said. However, it should be pointed out that overall revenue did grow in the three months to December, up to $33.7bn compared with $28.1bn for the same period last year. Net income – a US measure of profit – was $10.3bn for the quarter, down nearly $1bn on last year. Nonetheless, Meta remains a very wealthy and profitable business. The metaverse is a catch-all term for a blending of the physical and digital worlds, where people carry out their professional and social lives via a mix of virtual and augmented reality. Zuckerberg is so convinced it is the next big thing in tech that he renamed the company from Facebook Inc to Meta. But it is years away from being a fully fledged part of people’s lives. So the results from Meta’s virtual reality unit – Reality Labs, which includes the top-selling Oculus VR headsets – showed a loss of $3.3bn on revenues of less than $1bn. This is the future of Meta’s business, so expect the revenues to grow, as well as the costs.

2/3/2022,"For more than half a century the modest clock has been respectfully protected – wrapped in dusters – by the family of the man who pulled it out of the rubble on that terrible day. Now the Aberfan school clock, which stopped at 9.13am on 21 October 1966, the precise time an avalanche of coal waste crashed into classrooms and homes, claiming the lives of 116 children and 28 adults, is to go on display at a Welsh museum.  Mike Flynn, whose father was one of the rescuers who rushed to Pantglas junior school, handed the clock over to the permanent collection of Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales on Thursday. The clock will be put on display in the “Wales Is” gallery at St Fagans National Museum of History in Cardiff from 16 February, a permanent, tangible reminder of one of the most tragic days in Welsh history. Flynn described how his late father, also Mike Flynn, a postal worker and a paramedic in the Territorial Army, was among those who went to help as news began to emerge that slurry, coal waste and tailings had poured from the hillside into the village. He said: “My father travelled up from Cardiff to Aberfan. I was only seven but remember the day vividly. I got back from school and both the front and back door was open. My father was supposed to be there but was absent. Then the disaster was all over the news. It was quiet, eerie.” Flynn Sr plucked the clock from the rubble and handed it over to the police. After the inquiry into the disaster, the clock was returned to the family, and it has emerged only once in public since then, for the 50th anniversary of the tragedy in 2016. Like many victims, families and rescuers, Flynn Sr was deeply upset by what he saw that day. “He didn’t talk about it but he was profoundly affected,” his son said. Flynn Sr decided to do what he could for his own community, including taking residents of children’s homes out on trips. He kept the clock in the box it had come back in from the inquiry, and after he died it was passed to his son for safekeeping. “We kept it wrapped in dusters and clingfilm,” Flynn said. Flynn, 61, a technical director for an electrical company, is delighted that the museum is taking the clock in. “It is the most appropriate place for it. The clock is a very poignant reminder of what happened. It seems to encapsulate that moment in time. It’s an emotive piece. My family has been the custodians of the clock for 55 years but we always felt it was owned by Aberfan and the Welsh community.” Sioned Williams, the principal curator of modern history at St Fagans, said: “We’re very grateful to Mike for donating the clock. It means a great deal. There aren’t many objects that survive to tell the story of the Aberfan disaster. It’s an opportunity for us to tell a very important story. We hope to collect many more items linked to the disaster.” The clock may be an historical artefact but the issue of coal tips has not gone away. The Labour-led Welsh government continues to call on Boris Johnson’s UK administration to allocate long-term funding for the tips that still threaten communities across Wales. The Welsh government argues that extreme weather caused by the climate crisis is making many of the tips unstable and believes at least £500m to £600m will be needed over the next 10 to 15 years to make them safe. Only this week there were heated exchanges in the Welsh parliament, with the Tories saying the Labour government had to pay for the tips to be made safe, and the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, insisting the UK government had to help. Lee Waters, the Welsh deputy minister for climate change, said: “The issue is a live one. We really worry that history will repeat itself if we don’t make these tips safe. We’ve got 40% of the UK’s coal tips in Wales. This is not something that has happened since we’ve had devolved powers. It’s a legacy of Britain’s industrial past and Britain has a responsibility to put it right, not just Wales.”",News/UK news,Family of Aberfan rescuer give stopped clock to Welsh museum,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/03/family-of-aberfan-rescuer-give-stopped-clock-to-welsh-museum
2/3/2022,"The Super Bowl, the NFL’s ultimate coronation and by far the most watched event in America, is a little over a week away. Yet you wouldn’t know it because Brian Flores’s explosive lawsuit against the league and its clubs alleging racial discrimination in its hiring practices continue to take the NFL zeitgeist by storm. The Flores complaint, which lays out the disturbing history of racism in the NFL, includes extensive data supporting the notion that qualified Black candidates have long been passed over in droves for head coach, coordinator, and general manager openings. The NFL currently has just one Black head coach in Mike Tomlin. One, despite 70% of NFL players being Black. One, even though many of these players strive to become coaches and executives in the league upon retirement. Thirty-two teams. One Black head coach.  But the other piece of Flores’s complaint may be even more difficult for the league to ignore. Flores alleges that Dolphins owner Stephen Ross offered to pay him $100,000 per loss in 2019 in hopes of securing the No 1 draft pick in the 2020 draft. Flores claims his refusal to comply was the beginning of the end of his time in Miami. The Dolphins won five games that season despite unloading a litany of key players, including safety Minkah Fitzpatrick and left tackle Laremy Tunsil. Ross denied these claims in a statement that read, “I take great personal exception to these malicious attacks, and the truth must be known. [Flores’s] allegations are false, malicious and defamatory.” Ross’s statement, late Wednesday night, came a full day and half after the allegations were made public. The NFL was hastier with its reaction, claiming Flores’s 58-page lawsuit was “without merit” just two hours after it was released. The notion of not investigating an owner who is alleged to have attempted to undermine the very fabric of competition was appalling. But after Flores’s media blitz where he emphatically repeated the claims for the world to hear the league reversed course and has now opened an investigation. Former Browns head coach Hue Jackson piled on, claiming that team owner Jimmy Haslam incentivized losses and was quite satisfied with Jackson’s 1-36 record during 2016 and 2017, which led to them gaining the No 1 draft pick in 2017 and 2018. The Browns have denied the charge calling any such claims “completely fabricated”. Paying a coach for poor performance may or may not be about race though the idea of a white owner thinking the Black coach would be acquiescent to his demands is quite plausible given the history of the NFL, and well, America. And many have noted in the last few days that when Black head coaches are given jobs, it’s often on teams with little chance of competing. This, the theory goes, allows teams to say they are committed to diversity but also means they can replace the Black head coach with a white one once things go wrong and a high draft pick has been secured. If any aspect of tanking under the behest of an owner is proven to be true, the NFL will be rocked in a way it has never experienced. Suck for Luck and Tank for Trevor might make cute hashtags and inspire fun social media banter. And sure, there reaches a point in every season where Jets fans, the first example that comes to mind, are ready to throw in the towel. But there’s a difference between viewing your position in the NFL draft order as a silver lining and intentionally plotting to lose. Tanking is the term we use but really this act of defying basic principles of competition deserves a far more potent moniker. NFL players put their bodies through the wringer in ways we can’t even imagine. The ramification is a career span that averages just 3.3 years. Every game is an audition. The idea that a player would spend a season or even a play intentionally trying to lose so a wealthy owner can get richer by selling more season tickets and jerseys with a splashy draft pick is repulsive. 49ers long snapper Taybor Pepper, who spent the 2019 in Miami under Flores, shared his thoughts in a now deleted tweet: “I’ve been quiet about my experience in Miami and still probably won’t go into details until my football career is over. Knowing that my EMPLOYER was actively trying to sabotage the season, again, makes me sick to my stomach. WHERE IS/WAS THE INTEGRITY.” There is no integrity if owners are out there incentivizing their coaches to lose. Zero. If true, the league as we know may be a thing of the past. The NFL is usually mired in some sort of controversy – Colin Kaepernick, concussions, domestic violence. Somehow, the league always weathers the storm, and keeps piling up the revenue. But if what Flores and Jackson are alleging (and perhaps others will come forward) is true it’s a slap in the face to every person involved in the league from fan to player to concession worker. These allegations are not dissimilar to the 1919 Black Sox scandal, when the Chicago White Sox were accused of taking bribes from a gambling syndicate to throw the World Series. That scandal created turmoil for Major League Baseball and led to the first appointment of a commissioner to restore integrity. It’s impossible to predict the exact fallout the league could be facing if these claims are backed with evidence. The league could enact massive fines and strip picks from the Dolphins in addition to forcing Ross to sell the team. It could also disincentivize teams from tanking by moving from a draft to a lottery like the NBA. But the deeper issue is the game itself. The beauty of sport and especially the NFL with its salary cap is that nothing is predetermined. But if we find out that it has been rigged all along, how can we consume the league in the same way? The NFL’s ability to survive scandal after scandal is almost a sport of its own. Somehow the league continues to thrive in large part thanks to high-budget TV broadcasts, fantasy football, the league’s marketing machine and its global ambitions, but most of all because of its product. If that product is proven to be tainted, the NFL will finally be faced with a scandal it can’t slither out of. And even if the tanking allegations are not proven true or Flores settles the lawsuit, the seeds of mistrust have been planted.",Sport/Sport,"If owners really paid coaches bonuses to lose, the NFL is in big trouble",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/03/nfl-tanking-allegations-owner-payments-brian-flores-hue-jackson
2/3/2022,"Waitrose is ditching free newspapers for loyalty card-holders from 22 February in the latest example of supermarkets cutting costs amid surging inflation. Members of the myWaitrose scheme can claim back the cost of a range of newspapers if they spend £10 with the supermarket.  In a letter to its 8.5 million scheme members, Waitrose said it would replace the current deal with more personalised offers, which would change each week. A spokesperson said: “We’re improving the myWaitrose programme to offer customers personalised discounts on the products they buy most. “While the newspaper offer was enjoyed by some of our customers, in reality it was only being used by around 5% of members. The new approach will mean that all members can make greater savings by receiving benefits tailored to them.” The change sparked outrage among some of the the supermarket’s shoppers, coming just under a year after the retailer stopped offering free coffees to MyWaitrose members in stores. The retailer said the coffee deal was paused during the pandemic but did not give a date when it may return. One shopper tweeted: “What?! Waitrose are stopping their #myWaitrose newspaper offer!! And their list of consolation offers are not comparable! The paper with the myWaitrose Saturday shop has been the cornerstone of our family’s weekend for YEARS! Not happy with this at all. I want to know why?!” Several loyalty card holders said the free paper was their main reason for membership. One tweeted: “Austerity has finally arrived at Waitrose No more free newspapers with your shopping! I used to walk down to Waitrose a few times a week for top ups and the free newspaper was a real bonus, now the local Tesco will do just fine.” Supermarkets are searching for ways to cut costs to try and keep a lid on shop prices as inflation hits both food and non-food items in the UK. Heavy competition across the industry, particularly from the the discounters Aldi and Lidl, is forcing the other supermarkets to keep down prices despite rising costs of basic commodities and ingredients, transport, energy and fuel. This week, Tesco announced it would stop selling music and films in its supermarkets by the end of this month, shut deli counters, close down its small Jack’s chain and stop night shifts in dozens of stores in an attempt to keep costs down. The latest shake-up at Waitrose comes after a series of tweaks to the terms of its loyalty-card scheme over the years. In 2017 it also required scheme members to buy something before pouring themselves a free hot drink. That came after long queues formed at its self-service machines as the original generous deal enabled even those who were not making a purchase to pick up a free drink. Before that, Waitrose told those who wanted to a free hot drink in one of its cafes that they also had to buy a “treat” – such as a sandwich, cake, biscuit. The latest change to the loyalty scheme may also be a blow for the newspaper industry, with redemptions accounting for up to 10% of some titles’ weekend sales in the supermarket, according to the trade journal RN. RN quoted one industry insider saying that Waitrose pick-ups were particularly important for weekend sales of the Daily Mail, Telegraph and Sunday Times.",News/Business,Waitrose to scrap free newspapers for loyalty-card customers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/03/waitrose-to-scrap-free-newspapers-for-loyalty-card-customers
2/3/2022,"Sue Gray’s interim report into events at No 10 finds “failures of leadership and judgment”. Exactly whose failures are left hanging, for now. I’m a serial Boris supporter. As an MP, I backed his abortive leadership bid in 2016 and his victorious campaign in 2019. I was drawn to his brand of Brexity, one-nation Conservatism. I doubt any of us backed him because we’d spotted a paragon of virtue. We were clear eyed about him then, we must own the consequences now.  Indeed, a sense of vicarious liability for the man we advanced has probably stayed the hand of several MPs in recent days. But the Conservative party is notoriously unsentimental. It likes to be a winning machine. Dark arts are always in scope. The calculus my colleagues are now grappling with is whether Boris is ultimately an electoral asset or liability. It seems a tipping point in either direction has not yet been reached. But if and when the men and women in grey suits do end up calling time on the PM, he will be entitled to leave with head held high. Guardian readers can spit as many tacks as they like, but he delivered Brexit. Only Boris could. He won a jaw-dropping election victory, seizing votes in districts that had eluded my party for decades. To the uncomprehending fury of the fashionable London left, UK politics will never again be the same. The judgment calls on Covid have – generally – been the right ones. OECD data points to the UK’s economic recovery leading the G7 in 2022. These are things that have real life consequences for people I represent, who live way outside the M25. I am not attempting to belittle or distract from partygate. Integrity and honesty should be at the very heart of government alongside leadership and judgment. Law makers simply can’t be law breakers. The parliamentary Conservative party may hand Boris his P45 if the Met or Gray’s definitive report collar the PM. But I’m guessing the point of danger for Boris will be in May. Then we will probably have a perfect storm – the widely predicted midterm council election hit, with disposable incomes falling as energy costs bite, national insurance rises, and inflation erases any uptick in wages. What to do? The usual deputies’ head may roll, obviously. Then there’s the rumoured bandolier of eye-catching policy announcements that researchers believe will appeal particularly in so-called “red wall” seats. These deliverables, the young ones calculate, will shore up the PM’s position among wavering MPs. But government must never be a self-licking lollipop. For example, it’s all very well calling in the navy to sort out the Channel crisis. Mobilising the troops always look good. But unless the fundamentals are changed – and they have not been – the problem is simply kicked down the road and, in this case, the navy’s reputation with it. No, the key to any reset can only be an unrelenting focus on driving through manifesto commitments. No gimmicks, no smoke and mirrors – for example around what is and is not a new hospital and, for goodness sake, no more mayors. Two years of this parliamentary term have been lost to Covid. That means the government has to work twice as fast to ensure big-ticket items such as social care, and a truly epic deal on new homes, raising them up from the nation’s brownfield sites in a way not seen since the early 1950s, are under way by the time voters next have an opportunity to pass judgment.
