It was seen by hundreds of thousands, with queues snaking into Kensington High Street. Richard was enthusiastic, faith leaders declared that it should be acceptable to their followers, and James Porter, the institute’s director, toured it to museums round the world. It was a high point in a late 80s flowering of the institute, which focused on the cultures of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, before the Foreign and Commonwealth Office closed it.

1/14/2022,"For survivors of Syria’s brutal detention system, the landmark conviction of a former Syrian intelligence official for crimes against humanity represents a vital step towards justice. “We initially hoped for a trial at the international criminal court, but nevertheless this is an important step,” said Hussein Ghrer, one of 24 former detainees of Branch 251, a military intelligence unit with its own prison in Damascus, who testified against Anwar Raslan.  “Finally, we have an official conviction saying that these individuals have committed crimes in the context of mass attacks on Syrians and systematic crimes against humanity. I believe this is the most important thing to build on in future.” Raslan, a former colonel with the Syrian intelligence service, was convicted by a court in Koblenz of crimes against humanity, including 27 counts of murder. He was accused by prosecutors of overseeing abuse, sexual assault and the torture of more than 4,000 people at Branch 251. The site became synonymous with brutal abuse by security officials after the government of Bashar al-Assad used maximum force to quell protests. Raslan is the highest-ranking Syrian official to stand trial for atrocities committed in Syria. He was charged under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows the prosecution of serious crimes against international law, such as genocide and torture, in one country even if they happened elsewhere. At least 100,000 people are recorded as detained or missing in Syria, the United Nations said in 2019, although activists say the true number may be far higher. The Syrian Network for Human Rights puts the figure at about 150,000 and estimates that nearly 15,000 people have died from torture in Syria since March 2011. Human Rights Watch described this as “violence that is not readily visible: the hidden prisons and torture centres into which tens of thousands of Syrians have disappeared – sometimes to re-emerge years later, sometimes never to be heard from again”. Raslan is the second person to be convicted in Koblenz for activities related to Branch 251, after the conviction last year of Eyad al-Gharib, a former intelligence officer, for his role in transporting detainees to the prison. The trial represented the first opportunity of its kind for former detainees such as Ghrer to testify about their treatment in detention. “I was interrogated and beaten all over my body, but the worst was seeing others being brutally tortured, because you don’t know what could happen next,” he said. Ghrer also described the experience of seeing Raslan – the man who directed his torture and that of his fellow detainees – in the dock, a decade after he was arrested in Damascus for filming protests. “We were powerless, we were mistreated. [Raslan] was not mistreated, and he has a right to lawyers and translators,” he said. “I wouldn’t want to be in his shoes, of course,” Ghrer added, “but to be in a place where we are holding him accountable, it feels good. Finally, we were able to pursue a kind of justice. “I don’t believe in full justice – I believe in a journey towards justice and this is the first step.” In a statement read out by his defence lawyers during the hearing, Raslan claimed he was not associated with torture and denied that it had taken place under his watch. Martin Holsky, a chief inspector with the Baden-Württemberg state police, later testified that Raslan told him: “With this many interrogations in one day, you can’t always be polite. With armed groups, you sometimes need to be stricter.” “He doesn’t believe he did anything wrong,” said Ghrer. “I was in court many times, watching his expressions. He looks at us with disgust. As if he doesn’t believe he’s being held accountable, or he believes he’s not like other members of the regime.” Other survivors agreed. “In my testimony, I said that I wish for him to spend a lot of time in prison so he could think about all of us,” said Ruham Hawash, who was detained at Branch 251 in 2012. “I want him to think about all the people who testified against him in court, all the people that he tortured and whose torture he was responsible for during his career. I think with enough time he will not be able to run from these thoughts.” Hawash said the trial in Koblenz represented an opportunity for justice she had not expected. “I was tortured at Branch 251. I felt like, at that time, a part of my dignity was taken from me. So another thing about this trial is that I feel like, for me personally, I’m getting some of my dignity back that I lost in 2012,” she said. She also pointed to the body of evidence used to convicted Raslan, including thousands of photos of detainees tortured to death in prison, provided by a Syrian military photographer known only as Caesar. “This verdict is a tool to demonstrate that this regime uses systematic torture,” she said. The verdict carries wider implications for countries across Europe, including the UK and Denmark, where governments have voiced proposals to return Syrian asylum seekers. “I see this trial not just as justice but as a sign to the world that this regime uses torture systematically – which also means we can’t send people back,” she said. Raslan’s conviction also comes amid efforts by some governments across the Middle East to re-establish relations with Assad’s government, despite previously backing his overthrow. The verdict in Koblenz, as well as multiple ongoing trials against former regime officials in Germany and elsewhere across Europe, present opportunities for accountability alongside the risk that such trials might dissuade higher-level officials from within the Syrian regime from providing information, or being brought to justice outside Syria. “Other perpetrators might see that they can’t get away with their crimes, but it also means they won’t leave Syria, or people who worked for the regime might not leave their posts,” said Hawash. “It’s complicated.” Yet for campaigners and the families of thousands of those still missing inside Syrian detention centres, Raslan’s conviction represents an important step to providing vital information about their fate. “There are still more than 100,000 people in prison – we have no idea where they are and if they’re alive or dead. Justice cannot truly come while there are still people in jail,” said Lamis al-Khateeb, a member of the group Families for Freedom, who gathered outside court to witness Raslan’s sentencing.",News/Global development,Jailing of former Syrian secret police officer is ‘first step towards justice’,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/13/jailing-former-syrian-secret-police-officer-anwar-raslan-germany-first-step-justice
1/14/2022,"I was struck by a sad parallel between your article on the Deepwater Horizon blaze (Life after Deepwater Horizon: the hidden toll of surviving disaster on an oil rig, 6 January) and the articles on the overwhelming of ambulance services and other parts of the NHS (Ministers must act now on NHS staffing crisis, health chiefs warn, 5 January). In both cases employees have been subject to “moral injury”. The imperatives of cost pressures imposed either by BP or by the government mean that suffering is caused to employees through being required to do things which transgress the values at the core of their identity or being betrayed by their employers violating their sense of “what’s right”. While members of the government appear to be comfortable with the idea that parts of the health service will be overwhelmed, they forget that the service is made up of committed and hard-working people dedicated to relieving the suffering of others. Not only are many healthcare workers physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted, but they are also suffering moral injury: unable to do what is right for their patients in the current situation, forced by circumstance to do things which transgress their core values. While some may recover from exhaustion of all kinds, even from the well- documented post-traumatic stress disorder with which many have been diagnosed, moral injury can cause distress and disillusion that cuts to the core and cannot be healed.  Not only are these workers being harmed by the government’s stance, but also by the patients who, suffering from reduced services, are venting their fear, frustration and anger on these same staff members. How can it be acceptable that while patients, staff and their families are harmed, politicians appear to escape scot-free?Philippa MerrillDownton, Wiltshire",News/Society,Insult and injury to overwhelmed NHS staff | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/13/insult-and-injury-to-overwhelmed-nhs-staff
1/14/2022,"Like Novak Djokovic, I tested positive for Covid-19 in December (Novak Djokovic blames agent for Australian paperwork ‘mistake’ and admits not isolating after positive Covid result, 12 January). Unlike him I was fully immunised and away from home (in a New York hotel). To comply with US regulations, my wife and I isolated for 10 days over Christmas and New Year. In compliance with UK regulations, we took negative rapid antigen tests before flying home and day 2 PCR tests on our return: mine was positive. Subsequently, I have spoken to five test-and-trace agents (a sixth hung up on my wife) and have been emailed and messaged repeatedly to complete the online contact-tracing form.  Despite persisting PCR positivity after recovery being well recognised, apparently there is no way to register this “on the system”. One agent told me to contest the result on 119, but I could not find out how; that is unsurprising as the call-directing algorithm has at least five layers and up to six choices at each layer, giving hundreds of possible choice combinations. The next agent I reached denied that an option to contest exists. As regards the contact form, the section asking where you have been in the previous five days accepts only UK addresses, making it impossible for me to complete truthfully. A final twist is that the complaints form (which does not allow “special characters” such as colons, inverted commas and question marks) promises a reply within 25 working days.

1/14/2022,"Hello, and Happy Thursday, For the last few years, I’ve wanted to write about the way Mississippi disenfranchises certain felony convictions. Every state in the country has slightly different felon disenfranchisement laws, but the one in Mississippi is especially harsh.  More than 235,000 people in the state can’t vote because of a felony conviction, according to an estimate by the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice non-profit organization. That’s more than 10% of the voting age population, and nearly 16% of Black people of voting age can’t vote because of a felony conviction. Mississippi has the highest felon disenfranchisement rate in the country as states around the country have recently loosened such statutes, many of which are rooted in the explicit racism of the Jim Crow era. Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Iowa, Virginia, Louisiana and New York have all taken steps to make it easier for people convicted of felonies to vote again. Mississippi’s law has remained untouched and unchanged. Over the last few months, I’ve been speaking with Roy Harness and Dennis Hopkins, two Mississippi men who are permanently blocked from voting in Mississippi because of crimes they committed decades ago. Last weekend, we published a story explaining how both men feel the consequences of a racist law that continues to block thousands from voting today. In 1890, delegates at the state’s constitutional convention picked a handful of crimes that would cause someone to lose their right to vote forever. At first glance, that list appears random – bribery, burglary, theft, arson, perjury, forgery, embezzlement and bigamy – were all included. Murder and rape were not. But a few years later, the Mississippi supreme court explained that the delegates deliberately chose crimes they thought Black people were more likely to commit. It was part of a broader scheme to block Black people from voting after the passage of the 15th amendment, which says no citizen can be denied the right to vote based on their race. There is a process today for people convicted of felonies to get their voting rights back, but it’s nearly impossible to navigate. Someone with a disqualifying felony must first convince a lawmaker to introduce an individualized bill on their behalf to regain suffrage. Both chambers of the Mississippi legislature must approve it by a two-thirds majority, and then the governor must approve it. There’s no state data tracking how many people apply and get approved each year. But Blake Feldman, a criminal justice researcher in Mississippi began tracking these bills in 2018. Scraping data from the Mississippi legislature’s website, he gathered every suffrage bill that’s been introduced since 1997. And what he found was staggering. Since 1997, just 185 people have been able to successfully use the process to get their voting rights back, his data shows. Some years, no people have made it through the process. On average, just seven people get their voting rights back per year. “It’s disturbing,” Feldman told me. When he began looking at the bills, Feldman told me he was surprised to see how many were introduced on behalf of people who had not committed one of the specific disqualifying crimes. Hannah Williams, a research and policy analyst at MS Votes, which works to expand voting access, told me there’s widespread confusion over how the law works. Her organization has been helping people get their data in. “There really isn’t a way to guarantee anything because the process doesn’t really make sense. There’s no information. You can’t go to a website. And to be honest, you can’t even call the capitol to get information, because they don’t really know what the process is,” she said. Both Harness and Hopkins are lead plaintiffs in two federal lawsuits challenging the Mississippi law. Both of them told me they didn’t even know there was a process for them to get their voting rights back. “It makes me feel bad. I’ve served my country, nation … got a degree and [I] still can’t vote, no matter what you do to prove yourself,” Harness told me. Also worth watching … Joe Biden on Tuesday gave the speech voting rights activists have been wanting to hear for months, calling for changing the Senate filibuster to pass voting rights legislation. But it still doesn’t seem like Democrats have the votes to change the filibuster. Days ahead of a vote, the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, called it an “uphill battle”. Candidates for secretary of state are raising unprecedented amounts of money so far, according to a new Brennan Center report, a reflection of the battle for control of election administration that is shaping up across the country, A three-judge panel in North Carolina upheld the state’s new congressional districts, which were drawn to heavily favor Republicans.

1/14/2022,"The family of Jalani Lovett, a 27-year-old who died in a Los Angeles jail last year, is demanding that the county sheriff’s department be held accountable and authorities release more information about the final moments of his life. Lovett died in solitary confinement in Men’s Central jail in downtown LA on 22 September. The county coroner released an autopsy report on Tuesday saying Lovett’s death was “accidental” and that he had fentanyl and heroin in his system.  But Lovett’s mother and siblings, who have been fighting for months to get basic information from authorities about what led to his death, are left with major questions about the case. If Lovett died from an overdose, how did he access fentanyl while in solitary confinement? What were the actions of guards on duty that night, in a jail with a history of mistreatment? And why did it take so long for the coroner to produce the autopsy report, which the county sent to a reporter this week before the family obtained it? “I’m a grieving mother, but I’m also an angry mother,” Terry Lovett, 65, told the Guardian this week in an interview from her home in Oakland. She said the sheriff’s department, which runs the jail, had repeatedly ignored her family’s pleas for answers: “They have no regard for human life.” “I want the truth to come out,” she added. “To me, this was murder. They killed my son.” Christian Contreras, a local civil rights attorney, filed a claim against the county on behalf of the family on Wednesday, the first step in a lawsuit, alleging “negligence causing wrongful death”, “deliberate indifference” in violation of the fourteenth amendment, an “inhumane killing” and more. Jalani Lovett, one of six siblings, grew up in east Oakland. He excelled at basketball and baseball as a teenager and won a poetry medal in school, his mother said. He was an aspiring rapper and a family man who was close with his nieces and nephews. He ended up at Men’s Central jail in September 2019 for a second-degree robbery charge, and his mother said he had been held in solitary confinement in the months before his death. A sheriff’s spokesperson told the Guardian he was in a “one-man cell” and was not there for disciplinary reasons. Terry Lovett said a detective in the sheriff’s homicide bureau informed her on the morning of 23 September that her son “was found dead” in his cell at 10pm the previous night. The official added that authorities had found “drug paraphernalia” in her son’s cell, she recalled, but said the investigation was ongoing. The family received little information from officials in the following weeks, they said. One investigator initially told Terry it could take eight months for her to get an official report, she recalled. About a month after the death, the family obtained photos from the coroner’s office showing Jalani’s body shortly after he died, which they believed showed signs of bruising and other possible injuries. Fueling their concerns further was a long history of scandals at the Men’s Central jail, with controversies including corruption and obstruction of justice cases and documented evidence of widespread abuse of incarcerated people. Jalani was housed in a section of the jail, the 3000 block, where guards have long been accused of being part of a “deputy gang” called the 3000 Boys, known for allegedly using excessive force. Vanessa Carter, one of Jalani’s sisters, said she talked had with her brother hours before his death and overheard him get into an argument with a guard, which also made the family suspicious. Combined with the photos and lack of information, the family questioned whether guards had beaten Jalani. Jalani’s official death certificate, issued a month after his death, listed his cause of death as “deferred”, meaning the medical examiner’s investigation was ongoing. It also listed the time of death as four hours earlier than what Terry was initially told, according to her records. The coroner’s report, released this week, noted he had a bruise on his neck and abrasions on his arms, but said there was “no external trauma” or “life-threatening injuries”. The report said deputies had found him unresponsive in his cell and issued Narcan and CPR. Lt Brandon Dean of the sheriff’s department told the Guardian that there were no signs Jalani had an altercation with guards, and that there was “nothing out of the ordinary” in his death. He declined to answer questions about how Jalani could have accessed fentanyl. Asked about the 3000 Boys, Dean declined to comment, saying it was not relevant to the case. The coroner’s report said the autopsy had been conducted on 28 September, one week after Jalani’s death. Contreras said he had filed a request for records in November, seeking footage, reports and the identity of the involved deputies, but had received no response. The coroner’s office sent the Guardian a copy of the autopsy on Tuesday before the attorney or Terry Lovett had seen it. The family said they were skeptical of the coroner’s report. “There are too many inconsistencies. What is being hidden?” Lovett said after receiving the report. She said she planned to have an independent medical examiner review the records. Contreras lamented the lack of transparency in the case, which he said was common in jail deaths: “When someone in their own custody dies in highly suspicious circumstances, as opposed to meeting with the family and providing answers, the sheriff’s department advances further secrecy.” Carter, Jalani’s sister, said she believed deputies should face charges for her brother’s death: “They are supposed to ‘protect and serve’ and take care of people. We should not be scared of them, and they should be accountable for their actions, just like we are for ours.” She added that she wanted her brother to be remembered as a loyal family man who taught her son, now 14, how to walk and play basketball. Ladell Dickerson, Jalani’s older brother, said that regardless of the cause of death, the county was to blame: “This is negligence. He was in their custody. He was under the authority of the sheriff. He was not in jail with a death sentence, but somebody in that jail either killed him or allowed him to die.” At a protest outside the jail on what would have been Jalani’s 28th birthday this week, Michelle Lovett, another sister, wished her brother a happy birthday, adding: “The system took my brother, but they will not take our right to know the truth.” Terry Lovett also lodged a complaint with the office of inspector general in November, but has not heard back. She said she was not confident that she would get justice for her son in LA county, but that she would keep fighting. She said she now spent most days trying to get information on the case: “I know I can’t bring my son back, but I want to stop this from happening to somebody else’s child.” In Terry’s final call with her son, Jalani was in a good mood, she said. He heard he would be transferring soon to state prison to finish his sentence. He was looking forward to leaving the jail, she said, and getting one step closer to coming home.",News/US news,‘The system took my brother’: family demands answers in LA jail death,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/13/jalani-lovett-la-jail-death

1/14/2022,"Private hospital operators including Spire Healthcare and Circle Health will receive between £225m and £525m from NHS England under a deal struck this week to maintain services and ensure the health service does not become overwhelmed as cases of the Omicron Covid variant surge. NHS hospitals in England will be able to use private hospitals and staff if Covid-19 admissions soar to avoid delays in treatment for patients with serious illnesses such as cancer. The financial details of the three-month deal, announced on Monday, have emerged in a letter from the NHS England chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, to the health secretary, Sajid Javid, dated 7 January.  The letter sets out that private hospital groups will receive a minimum of £75m to £90m a month between January and March in return for the NHS reserving capacity at their hospitals. This could rise to £175m a month if there is a big increase in hospital admissions. Private hospital groups have indicated they could provide about 5,600 beds if required, the letter says. It is estimated that 2,000 to 3,000 of these beds could be staffed, subject to staff absence levels, although the firms could not confirm this to the NHS. The companies also include Nuffield Health, Ramsay Health Care UK and Aspen Healthcare. Pritchard warned in the letter that the NHS would be “exposed financially, particularly if surge arrangements are triggered”. “On a per-bed basis, this is significantly more expensive than the equivalent cost of an NHS site with much less certainty on the potential staffed capacity,” she wrote. “The NHS would normally only pay for activity actually delivered. In giving a minimum income guarantee there is a material risk that the NHS pays for activity that is not performed.” But, in seeking approval for the deal from the health secretary, Pritchard went on to say: “You may also take the view that if we do nothing or delay, the risk that pressure will grow on the NHS leading to Omicron overwhelming local systems is unacceptable. “Such risks manifesting would result in significant cancellation of elective care, where we have started to address the impact of earlier waves of the pandemic. You may therefore take the view that agreeing the contract now is lower risk in terms of tackling Omicron and the higher value for money risk is acceptable.” The letter shows that NHS England has agreed a 10% premium to the standard NHS tariff for all work above the value of the minimum income guarantee, and further premiums for more complex work such as cancer treatments “to incentivise the relevant independent sector providers (ISPs) to deliver activity that would not normally be done by ISPs because they deem it not profitable at standard NHS tariffs”. The deal, which expires on 31 March, comes after the Covid-19 outbreak prompted NHS England in March 2020 to strike a similar deal with the private sector, which cost about £400m a month. It block-booked all 7,956 beds in England’s 187 private hospitals along with their almost 20,000 staff to help the NHS as it battled Covid-19.",News/Business,Private health firms in England to receive up to £525m to fight Omicron surge,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/13/private-health-firms-england-fight-omicron-surge-hospital-operators-services-nhs
1/14/2022,"Agood apology can work wonders in improving relations between individuals and between groups. In acknowledging the wrong, taking responsibility for it, and doing something about it, one can repair the identities of both the offender and the offended. The person apologising is no longer a threat, and the one receiving the apology is no longer denigrated, allowing the two to come together in a new and more positive way.  The problem is that yesterday’s statement offered by Boris Johnson was not a good apology. It was full of justifications and it offered nothing in the way of actions. Indeed it was not an apology at all, for it didn’t accept that an offence had been committed in the first place. Rather it was a classic example of the political non-apology, which takes the rhetorical form of saying sorry (and indeed prominently includes words like “I am sorry” and “I apologise”), but which ultimately attributes blame to the other rather than taking it upon oneself. Far from repairing relations, it compounds the original offence and makes things still worse. We are all familiar with non-apologies of the “I’m sorry if you were offended” sort, where the import is that you were unreasonable in taking offence, rather than that I was unreasonable in what I said or did. This logic is usually implicit and rarely spelled out, although the Texas Republican congressman Joe Barton famously apologised for his defence of BP during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster, saying: “If anything I said this morning has been misconstrued to the opposite effect, I want to apologise for that misconstruction.” Johnson’s offering may be somewhat more camouflaged, but it is equally brazen in its attribution of blame. As ever with non-apologies, he starts by saying “I want to apologise”. Then, after acknowledging the rage of those who “think” that Covid regulations were broken by Downing St, Johnson insists that “when I went into that garden just after six on 20 May 2020 … I believed implicitly that this was a work event”. He further insists that he was right since “it could be said technically to fall within the guidance”. However, “there are millions and millions of people who would not see it that way”. People, he added, who have “suffered terribly”. Finally, Johnson offers his “heartfelt apologies” to these people (and to the House of Commons). According to this statement, the problem does not lie in anything Johnson did. The problem lies in the inability of the public to appreciate the facts – and if Johnson erred in any way, it was in not appreciating just how wrong the public can be. To add insult to injury, even the suffering of the public is weaponised against them to imply that this was associated with their inability to think straight. Ultimately, then, when Johnson mouths the words “heartfelt apologies”, he is actually saying sorry for the flaws of others. Not only is this the opposite of a genuine apology – it has the opposite effect to a genuine apology in terms of its impact on social relations. The sense that there is “one law for them and another for us” has resulted in a catastrophic and enduring lack of trust. The creation of in- and outgroups becomes particularly toxic when the outgroup is seen as a threat to ingroup members. Nothing signifies threat quite like the sense that others view you with contempt. And the prime minister’s non-apology communicates contempt for the public in at least three ways. There is direct contempt in the claim that the public is incapable of understanding the guidance. Then, there is indirect contempt in assuming that anyone might be gullible enough to believe that Johnson went into his garden and didn’t realise a party was going on, especially when his own principal private secretary had emailed staff to tell them about the party. To compound it all, there is contempt in the notion that Johnson’s statement constitutes any sort of apology and that we should now accept it, shut up, and let the internal inquiry run its course. All in all, this tawdry episode does nothing to improve relations. On the contrary, it serves only to confirm Johnson as someone who stands apart from and against the public. That isn’t good for the Conservatives. But nor is it good for our democracy in the face of such an acute crisis.

1/14/2022,"Boris Johnson’s appearance at a Downing Street party during lockdown could mark his downfall, European media have concluded, painting a devastating picture of a “vain, fickle, hypocritical opportunist” with an “elastic relationship to the truth” who only ever “played at being prime minister”. Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung said in a brutal editorial that it had “only ever been a matter of time” before the British prime minister was exposed to one and all as the emperor with no clothes.  “Boris Johnson has never really changed,” the paper said. “He’s always been a seducer and a loudmouth. Always lied when it’s in his interest. He is the great illusionist of British politics.” Johnson’s “remorseful confessions” and “submissive contrition” would do little to change things, the paper said. He may have “posed as Churchill” and looked like “the saviour of the kingdom” after his election victory in 2019, but unlike his historical hero, “Johnson has himself led Britain into an existential crisis, for which he bears full responsibility. “He has not given up his playful, unserious nature. His fickleness is revealed in his government’s absence of strategy. Snobbery explains his lack of interest in the state of the country. Boris Johnson doesn’t govern, he plays at being prime minister.” Another German paper, Die Welt, said few options remain open. With polls showing 66% of voters want him to step down, Johnson “could voluntarily and immediately resign, as all three opposition leaders urged him to do. But that has never happened in British parliamentary history.” He intended to wait for the outcome of the official investigation, the paper said, and assured the Commons on Wednesday he would accept its conclusion. If Sue Gray’s verdict allowed, however, the prime minister would probably try to hang on. “But that won’t be easy,” the paper said. “The public view that there is ‘one rule for those up there, and another for everyone else’ has taken root.” Johnson may even have to go before local elections: “Partygate has made the Joker a burden.” Handelsblatt, another German publication, agreed. “Johnson has weathered many storms,” it said. “But this time, it looks bad. Even if the investigation exonerates him, he has tough weeks ahead: soaring inflation, a cost of living crisis … His overthrow looks likely by May.” For France’s Le Monde, the last couple of months has proved “calamitous” for a “bumbling politician” whose faults – “opportunism, no attention to detail, an elastic relationship with the truth” – everyone seemed ready to forgive, until now. The prime minister’s fall in popularity has been “so brutal that his immediate future appears to be in jeopardy”, the paper said, with many Tory MPs “now doubting his ability to lead the party to a fourth consecutive victory” and the rightwing press turning on him. “Johnson should not be underestimated: he has political flair, charisma and, so far, he has been very lucky,” the paper said. But if he survives partygate, he still has to act on the cost of living, and “satisfy impatient Brexiters with more than chimeras”. Having ousted the party’s “most reasonable members”, Johnson, caught between “a young guard demanding more public spending for the disadvantaged, and Thatcherites eschewing all state intervention”, has no moderate Tory support left, it said. For Libération, too, “gone are the days of arrogant victories, electoral landslides and spicy slogans. Two and a half years after his election, prime minister Boris Johnson is up against the wall. The party is over – and so are the jokes.” After multiple previous revelations, the “spring aperitif” mid-lockdown could prove fatal, the French paper said. At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, Tory MPs said little about the scandal – “but behind the thick curtains of the tearooms, things are on the move”. Spain’s El País said the prime minister’s ability to surprise “has much to do with how he shuns conventional thinking. He does what no one would expect, and acts as if he is exempt from the rules that apply to other mortals,” the paper said. “Until Wednesday, when he had no choice but to take the obvious course and say sorry.” Typically, however, even his apology was “an attempt to cover his back”, the paper said: “He admitted his presence – but said he thought it was a work gathering.” In the Netherlands, NRC Handelsblad said the scandal was “just one of the many difficult developments Johnson has to contend with”, citing soaring living costs due to “inflation, high energy prices and the negative consequences of Brexit”. Add in the coming tax and social security hike in April and despite “Johnson’s proven ability to squeeze out of a tight spot like nobody else”, his prospects for survival look slim, “particularly when 65% of the electorate consider him incompetent”. De Volksrant said Johnson’s “clownish appearance conceals a man long engaged on a ruthless drive for the top – but one who needs to be loved. That may explain why he couldn’t say no to a drink with his staff.” It was not voters or the opposition that could topple Johnson this time, the Dutch paper said, but his own party. “Hugely popular at the time of his election victory, he has since made enemies in his own circle. That distaste becomes dangerous when the prime minister’s popularity with voters is plunging.”",News/Politics,"‘Vain, fickle, hypocritical’: how Europe sees Boris Johnson after partygate",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/13/vain-fickle-hypocritical-how-europe-sees-boris-johnson-after-partygate
1/14/2022,"Joe Biden plans to send 1,000 military medical personnel to hospitals and medical facilities, amid a surge in Covid-19 cases largely attributed to the Omicron variant. The president will announce the effort on Thursday, and the military members will begin arriving in states across the country next week, as a top government official admitted it was likely that most Americans would be infected with the coronavirus.  On Tuesday the US recorded a record number of hospitalisations due to Covid-19 as daily infections soared to more than 1.35m. A test kit shortage across the country continues to hamper efforts to control the Omicron variant, but a silver lining has emerged, with signs that Omicron may be peaking in parts of the north-east. In New York City the number of new cases has flattened in recent days, the New York Times reported, while New Jersey and Maryland have seen a slight decrease in the number of infections. “Every case is one too many, but if you watch the trend line, it looks like we may be cresting over that peak,” Kathy Hochul, governor of New York, said in a briefing this week. “We are not at the end, but this is a glimmer of hope when we desperately need that.” Biden is due to give remarks from the White House on Thursday, the Associated Press reported. The 1,000 members of the military will help mitigate staffing crunches at hospitals across the country, with many facilities struggling because their workers are in at-home quarantines due to the virus at the same time as Covid-19 cases have surged. They will supplement the more than 800 military personnel who have already been helping civilian hospitals since Thanksgiving, and the more than 14,000 national guard members who are assisting with testing and vaccinations. This week Janet Woodcock, the acting head of the Food and Drug Administration, said most Americans were likely to contract coronavirus. “I think it’s hard to process what’s actually happening right now, which is [that] most people are going to get Covid, all right?” Woodcock said. Biden will also announce that six additional military medical teams will be deployed to hospitals in Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio and Rhode Island. The US leads the world in the daily average number of new infections reported, accounting for one in every three infections reported worldwide, according to a Reuters tally, but many Americans are still unable to find test kits. In December Biden said 500m at-home coronavirus tests will be sent free to the American public. The government aims to send out the test kits by mid-January.",News/US news,Biden to send military teams to US states struggling with Covid spike,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/13/biden-military-covid-omicron-spike
