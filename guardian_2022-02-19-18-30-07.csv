2/19/2022,"The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is set to deliver a rallying call to the west to save his country from a Russian invasion when he plans to address a security conference in Munich on Saturday, despite US warnings that Russia might exploit his absence to topple him before he returns to Kyiv. His planned trip comes as Russian separatist force have called for a general mobilisation in the Russia-supporting east of the country.  The president’s office said he was going ahead with the trip but would return within a day. Zelenskiy wants to give world leaders a personal message of the scale of the threat and the extra support still needed to strengthen Ukraine’s defences. He is due to hold a bilateral meeting with the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, and will seek to have input into the G7 foreign ministers meeting also due to be held on Saturday. The US president, Joe Biden, said on Friday he was convinced an invasion was set to happen, including an attack on Kyiv, but if Zelenskiy makes it to Munich, he is likely to be urged not to respond to Russian provocations in the east by holding back from a military response that will be used as a pretext to mount an invasion. The White House said it was for Zelenskiy to decide whether to fly to Munich from Kyiv at a such a sensitive time for his country. Biden said it was for Zelenskiy to decide his itinerary but asked whether it was wise for him to leave. Biden said: “In the pursuit of a diplomatic solution it may not be … It’s his decision.” Kyiv and Munich are just over 850 miles apart. It’s possible for Zelenskyi to address the conference in the afternoon as scheduled and make the return trip in a day. The US is concerned Zelenskiy would not be unable to coordinate the military response if he happened to be out of the country the moment an attack was mounted. The US has also leaked intelligence showing Russia has plans to try to decapitate the Ukrainian leadership with targeted assassinations and arrests. Ukraine has been consistently trying to project a sense of normality, partly to minimise damage to the Ukrainian economy, but the call for calm is increasingly difficult to project given the escalation of violence in the east of the country and the transparent warnings by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, that a genocide is under way in the Donbas region. Amid a mass of disinformation, the OSCE special monitoring mission in Ukraine warned of an indisputable dramatic escalation of violence in the past 48 hours. Putin is due to be inspecting a Russian military exercise in Belarus. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is due to speak on the phone with Zelenskiy on Saturday before holding a further call with Putin. Separately, the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, is trying to organise a bilateral meeting with Putin in Moscow early next week. Italy is highly dependent on Russian gas imports, and is urging the EU to exclude energy from its near-complete sanctions package. It also wants an EU fund to divert resources to countries dependent on Russian energy. Draghi also urged that the sanctions should be gradated according to the severity of any Russian attack. Putin has indicated he is willing to keep gas supplies running in return for Italian support. The EU needs unanimity for any sanctions package among its 27 members, and is already facing problems persuading the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, a close ally of Putin who is facing national election in April. The US had claimed that as soon as an invasion starts sanctions will kick in, adding they will start at the top of the ladder. That forecast looks increasingly implausible as EU leaders positions start to differ on what constitutes an invasion worthy of imposing huge sanctions. Some EU leaders fear that once sanctions are imposed, it will be an admission that diplomacy has failed and there is no route back to saving Ukraine. Nato has made it clear it will not use force to protect Ukraine since it is not a Nato member and so not subject the Nato article 5 clause committing all member states to collective self-defence. Ukraine wants more weapons, and claims that under an agreement signed as part of ridding post Soviet Ukraine of nuclear weapons, the west undertook to protect Ukraine from external attack. The Budapest memorandum was signed by three nuclear powers – Russia, the US and the UK – in December 1994, but it is claimed that the assurances imposed no legal obligation on the signatories. In a statement from the president’s office, Zelensky said he hoped to emerge from the conference with concrete additional financial and security pledges, adding he would meet with Harris, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and other friends of Ukraine. He added: “The situation on the line of contact in Donbas, in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and near the borders of Ukraine is being analysed by special services of our state. There is a constant analysis of intelligence and exchange of information with partners. Ukraine regularly receives additional up-to-date intelligence on the activity of Russian forces.”The situation in the east of the country is completely controlled by the Ukrainian security and defence forces.",News/World news,Ukrainian president to call for west’s help at Munich conference,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/ukrainian-president-munich-conference-russia-volodymyr-zelenskiy

2/19/2022,"When Leicester beat Wolves on the opening day of the season it looked like Brendan Rodgers’ side were the more likely to make another tilt for the top four. But Leicester’s injury problems and Bruno Lage’s fine work have led to Wolves emerging as surprising challengers for a Champions League spot. That push will be helped by the fact that, in a rare occurrence this season, Lage has an almost fully fit squad to pick from this weekend. Leicester meanwhile, remain beset by injuries, including their entire first-choice defence.

2/19/2022,"When the former British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg joined Facebook in 2018, the company was immersed in a number of scandals. Cambridge Analytica had been harvesting personal data from Facebook profiles. UN human rights experts said the platform had played a role in facilitating the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya in Myanmar. Its policies during the 2016 US presidential election had come under fire. Now Clegg has taken a top role as the company’s president of global affairs. Will he be able to tackle the seemingly endless problems with the way that Facebook – which recently rebranded as Meta – works? For better or worse, Meta and Google have become the infrastructure of the digital public sphere. On Facebook, people access the news, social movements grow, human rights abuses are documented and politicians engage with constituents. Herein lies the problem. No single company should hold this much power over the global public sphere.  Meta’s business model is built on pervasive surveillance, which is fundamentally incompatible with human rights. Tracking and profiling users intrudes on their privacy and feeds algorithms that promote and amplify divisive, sensationalist content. Studies show that such content earns more engagement and in turn reaps greater profits. The harms and risks that Facebook poses are unevenly distributed: online harassment can happen to anyone, but research shows that it disproportionately affects people who are marginalised because of their gender, race, ethnicity, religion or identity. And while disinformation is a global phenomenon, the effects are particularly severe in fragile democracies. Despite his new title, Clegg alone won’t be able to fix these problems. But there are several things he should do to protect the human rights of its users. To begin with, he should listen to human rights activists. For years, they have recommended that Facebook conduct human rights due diligence before expanding into new countries, introducing new products or making changes to its services. They have also recommended the company invest more in moderating content to effectively respond to human rights risks wherever people use its platforms. The likelihood of online speech causing harm, as it did in Myanmar, is inextricably linked to the inequality and discrimination that exists in a society. Meta needs to invest significantly in local expertise that can shed light on these problems. Over the past decade, Facebook has rushed to capture markets without fully understanding the societies and political environments in which it operates. It has targeted countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, promoting a Facebook-centric version of the internet. It has entered into partnerships with telecommunications companies to provide free access to Facebook and a limited number of approved websites. It has bought up competitors such as WhatsApp and Instagram. This strategy has had devastating consequences, allowing Facebook to become the dominant player in information ecosystems. It’s also essential for Meta to be more consistent, transparent and accountable in how it moderates content. Here, there is precedent: the Santa Clara principles on transparency and accountability in content moderation, developed by civil society and endorsed (though not implemented) by Facebook, lay out standards to guide these efforts. Among other things, they call for understandable rules and policies, which should be accessible to people around the world in the languages they speak, giving them the ability to meaningfully appeal decisions to remove or leave up content. Meta should also be more transparent about the algorithms that shape what people see on its sites. The company must address the role that algorithms play in directing users toward harmful misinformation, and give users more agency to shape their online experiences. Facebook’s Xcheck system has exempted celebrities, politicians and other high-profile users from the rules that apply to normal users. Instead of making different rules for powerful actors, social media platforms should prioritise the rights of ordinary people – particularly the most vulnerable among us. As Meta is trying to become the “metaverse”, these problems will only become more apparent. Digital environments that rely on extended reality (XR) technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality, are still at an early stage of development. But already there are signs that many of the same issues will apply in the metaverse. Virtual reality glasses can collect and harvest user data, and some VR users have already reported a prevalence of online harassment and abuse in these settings. So far, Meta hasn’t put its users’ rights at the centre of its business model. To do so would mean reckoning with its surveillance methods and radically increasing the resources it puts towards respecting the rights of its users globally. Rather than rebranding and pivoting to XR, where the potential for harm stands to grow exponentially, Meta should press pause and redirect its attention to tackling the very tangible problems it is creating in our present reality. The time to address this is now.

2/19/2022,"The likely duel involving Manchester United’s Bruno Fernandes and Robin Koch is likely to form a key sub-plot as Marcelo Bielsa aims to atone for his side’s 5-1 defeat at Old Trafford back in August. Manchester United have changed managers since then but Fernandes, the scorer of a hat-trick in that dissection of Bielsa’s defence, remains and is likely to operate as the advanced playmaker in a 4-2-3-1 visiting formation. With Kalvin Phillips still sidelined by injury Koch is likely to anchor the Leeds midfield, with his principle task being to stop Fernandes. Given that the visitors are desperate to secure a Champions League place and Bielsa knows his side are too close to the relegation zone for comfort, much is at stake.

2/19/2022,"Alex Preston’s fourth novel is an intelligent historical fiction reflecting modern sensibilities concerning gender and race, though the setting is 18th-century Kent. Goody, the protagonist, is as comfortable wearing men’s attire as she is in a dress; her foster brother, Francis, has escaped slavery. “Winchelsea’s first dark-skinned resident”, he is largely welcomed by the community as a helper in the smuggling operations that bring both riches and terrors. Goody and Francis must confront the terrible wrongs done to their foster father and mother by a vicious gang of smugglers.  Preston bases his narrative on historical fact: Arthur Gray, a real-life leader of the Hawkhurst Gang, is rendered here in beautifully sinister terms. He wears gorgeous clothes and holds orgies in his grand house; his followers, who have names like Poison, terrorise the villages, raping, murdering and pillaging unchecked. Fear is woven into the very fabric of the buildings, locked and shuttered at the sight of any strange rider. Goody decides to take her revenge. Her foster father, however, was a Jacobite in close contact with Bonnie Prince Charlie, and first she must take part in the rebellion, under the name William Stuart. The horrors of the battle of Culloden are rendered vividly and excitingly. When Goody/William returns, she finds her home under siege, and faces up to her real father, a man as murderous as she has become; and to a family whom she must accept, and who must accept her as she is. Preston is also a nature writer, and his prose is keenly alive to the highways and holloways of Kent, while the atmosphere is salt-tanged and ale-tinged. There is strong visual imagery tending towards the filmic: a pregnant Goody seeking her foster brother in the county taverns is particularly poignant. Battles are thrilling; there are last-minute escapes, and the final standoff between the doughty Kentish folk and the Hawkhurst Gang will have you on the edge of your seat. Winchelsea is a well-wrought, satisfyingly solid romp that, at the same time, asks us to consider how deeply violence has scarred our past, and the ways in which society’s structures – small and large – can be reformed.

2/19/2022,"Boris Johnson has completed and returned the questionnaire he was sent by Scotland Yard, in which he was expected to defend his attendance at alleged parties under investigation. The prime minister was asked by police to fill in the form on Friday 11 February, as part of the “Operation Hillman” investigation into social gatherings in breach of Covid rules between 20 May 2020 and 16 April 2021.  No 10 confirmed the prime minister has complied with a Metropolitan police request for his answers to be submitted within a week of receiving the form last Friday. Downing Street has previously said his responses will not be made public. Officers involved with Operation Hillman, which is examining whether Covid restrictions were broken in Downing Street and across Whitehall, sent formal questionnaires to about 50 people as they look into the details of alleged Covid rule-breaking. It comes as a union representing civil servants said it had pushed for officials involved in the investigation to be able to consult notes on the evidence they gave to the Sue Gray inquiry to help inform their Met Q&A. Gray carried out an inquiry into claims of lockdown breaches at the top of government but has only published an interim report while she waits for the police investigation to be completed. Out of 16 events Gray reviewed, police are investigating 12 of them, including as many as six that the prime minister is reported to have attended. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the Association of First Division Civil Servants (FDA), said the decision to allow the notes to be viewed followed an effort by the union, which represents senior and middle management public servants. “To be clear, this has been agreed after a request from us, the FDA, their trade union,” he tweeted. “They will only be able to see what they said in their own interview, to assist them in completing the questionnaires from the Metropolitan police, who have raised no objection to this.” It is understood the Met had no objection. Gray said it was not “standard practice in internal investigations such as this” to share notes with interviewees, but said in a letter seen by the Guardian that she had decided “as an exceptional measure” that they would get “limited access”.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson hands in police questionnaire on ‘partygate’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/19/boris-johnson-partygate-hands-in-police-questionnaire-met-covid-rules-downing-street
2/19/2022,"Nico Porteous has dropped the curtain on New Zealand’s greatest ever Winter Games, overcoming the elements and a field of established champions to win the Olympic freeski halfpipe title. The 20-year-old from the South Island resort town of Wanaka soared and spun to New Zealand’s second ever gold medal at a Winter Olympics on Saturday, two weeks to the day after Zoi Sadowski-Synnott’s history-making first. Remarkably, only 12 of the 91 nations competing at the Beijing Games have managed to win more golds than two Kiwi athletes from a tiny lakeside hamlet. “We both come from a town of ten thousand people, and skiing and snowboarding is our passion,” Porteous said. “We just absolutely love it. When Zoi won her gold in slopestyle it was such a motivational moment for myself. I really, really, really wanted it, and that just made me put my head down and really work hard.”  Porteous didn’t win halfpipe’s most prestigious contest so much as survive it. On a blustery morning in the mountain village of Taizicheng, contestants were strewn across the course after crashes and many were left wondering if the competition should have been postponed. Had it not been the final event at the Genting Snow Park with Sunday’s closing ceremony fast approaching, it might have been. Unlike four years ago in Pyeongchang when he won a surprise bronze as a teenage outsider, Porteous went off as the hot favourite in Saturday’s final. Twelve entrants made three trips each down the 200m-long course known as the Secret Garden with the best score counting towards their finishing position. The reigning world and X Games champion immediately made good on advance billing, setting the target with a score of 93.00 that none of his rivals could approach. Porteous then more or less held on for dear life amid whipping gusts and a bitterly cold wind chill that dropped to -32C (-26F) and at times made a mockery of the competition. David Wise, the two-time defending Olympic champion from the United States, settled for the silver with a best score of 90.75 on his opening run, denied in his bid to join speed skater Bonnie Blair as the only Americans to win three straight golds in the same Winter Games event. Another American, Alex Ferreira, was four points adrift of Wise and added bronze to his Pyeongchang silver, completing a repeat of the podium from four years ago with the order reshuffled. “I can’t really describe it, to be honest,” Porteous said. “I’m so, so happy and I’m currently over the moon. I still can’t really believe it. The weather conditions were tough today. It was very slow and it was quite challenging. But I stomped what I knew and tried my best and left everything out there.” Porteous’s winning run on his first descent saw him launch high above the seven-metre walls on back-to-back double cork 1620s – the consecutive four-and-a-half-revolution manoeuvres only he has landed in competition – capped by an alley-oop 900 for a score of 93.00. It was more than enough to overtake Wise, the early frontrunner who recorded the only other score above 90 on the day with an opening run capped by back-to-back double cork 1240s. On a day when half of the 36 total runs were completed without a fall, the swirling winds made it practically impossible for the field to mount scoreboard pressure on the leader. No one in the field, including Porteous himself, managed a higher score on their final two attempts than Canada’s Noah Bowman, whose 84.75 on his second trip earned him fourth place on the day, two points out of the medals. “I had so much prepared,” Wise lamented. “It’s like I cooked a meal for everybody and I didn’t get to share it.” Not even the champion-elect was spared from the carnage. Porteous failed to complete his final two runs, emerging with blood trickling from his right ear after hitting his head while attempting a double-cork 1440 on his final try. Gus Kenworthy, the US-born freestyler who earned a silver medal in slopestyle for the US eight years ago but represented Great Britain at these Olympics after switching affiliations, was among several skiers who declared the punishing conditions a difference-maker. “The wind was the deciding factor for everyone,” said Kenworthy, who finished eighth. “Even the guys who are on top, they put down incredible runs – it was awesome to see – but they have all scaled back from what I think they were hoping to do. I certainly scaled back from what I was hoping to do.” Four years ago, Porteous and Sadowski-Synnott arrived in the Taebaek Mountains as fresh-faced upstarts looking to make their mark on the world stage. Sadowski-Synnott’s bronze in the big air, only 12 days before her 17th birthday, ended her country’s 26-year medal drought. It also made her New Zealand’s youngest ever Olympic medallist, a record that proved short-lived when Porteous, then 16, took halfpipe bronze less than two hours later. On Saturday, Porteous extended the legacy of the golden Kiwi pair forever bound in history by putting the finishing touches on a New Zealand masterpiece. “A halfpipe is a skier’s canvas,” he said. “It’s our opportunity to express ourselves in the form of skiing. It’s our art form.”",Sport/Sport,Two kids from one small town ski New Zealand to its greatest Games,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/19/two-kids-from-one-tiny-village-ski-new-zealand-to-its-greatest-games
