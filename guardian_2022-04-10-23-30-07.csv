4/10/2022,"When the husband of a heavily pregnant woman came looking for his wife after the Mariupol maternity hospital attack, describing her by her tattoos and earrings, Alina Buzunar had to tell him that she had died, and took the man to the morgue to identify the body. “He was absolutely calm until he found her,” she said. “Because he told us that until the last, he hoped it was not her. Then he cried a lot, it was a very sad situation.” An image of the as yet unnamed woman, pale faced and with a bloodied left hip, being stretchered out of the rubble by rescuers is one of the defining images of the terror wrought during the siege of the southern port city. A number of politicians, including Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, have called the attack a war crime. Russian officials said at the time that patients and staff had left and Ukrainian military targets were on site, although there is no evidence to support the claims. According to Buzunar, the head of the telemedicine department at the regional intensive care hospital, two buses of dazed and bloodied women and babies, some just days or even hours old, arrived at the hospital – the largest in the Donetsk region – for treatment that day, 9 March. “When the maternity hospital attack happened, we still had police in the city,” she said. “A police car arrived to our hospital and said they were going to bring us the ladies. We said we don’t have the right conditions to treat them, but in the circumstances we didn’t have any choice. “We didn’t have a specialist, only a neurologist, a gynaecological surgeon and a gynaecology intern. The woman in the image was hit by shrapnel and lost a lot of blood. We tried to save her but we couldn’t.” After the attack, one of the women gave birth to two babies – a boy and a girl. Three other children were born, some by caesarean section. However, they came just as Buzunan’s hospital had a new problem to deal with: it had fallen under Russian occupation. Staff had been sheltering in the basement when, on 11 or 12 March (Buzunan is not sure which, due to stress), they heard gunshots. “Russian soldiers said: ‘Lie down on the floor or we will start throwing grenades at you,’ and that’s when they came into the hospital,” she said. “They talked to the management, who asked them not to interfere with the work of the hospital. The main thing they asked of us was not to leave. They said that anyone who did would be shot.” It was a tense and stressful period. She could not leave the premises, so she lived in the basement, sleeping on sofas and chairs alongside colleagues, while two or three armed soldiers were stationed on every floor – first Russians, then separatists, she believes. The men were aggressive, repeatedly threatening doctors with machine guns, and they repurposed the first floor, which had been administrative offices, as a military base. Buzunar said the Russians soon moved in as many as 2,000 civilians from nearby housing, despite not having the means to feed them and having nowhere for people to sleep. At around the same time, the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Facebook that patients and civilians had been taken hostage at the hospital by the Russians who were using them as human shields. The hospital worked to treat mostly shrapnel and bullet wounds in civilians and soldiers. Russian soldiers were whisked away quickly to recover elsewhere, while Ukrainian soldiers who were unlucky enough to still be in the hospital when the Russians came were considered to be captives, Buzunar said. “It was already very difficult because we didn’t have a lot of medication and windows were missing because of explosions. It was freezing cold, minus temperatures, so all the patients were kept in the corridors,” she said. “Then a tank came and began to shoot at the hospital. One member of staff had his ribs broken and all the patients who had been lying in the corridor seemed like they were on the open street because the walls were destroyed – all of these patients died.” Amnesty International has said Russia’s indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas in Ukraine and on protected objects such as hospitals may violate international humanitarian law. Buzunar, who escaped to western Ukraine in late March, said she asked Russian troops why they had fired at the hospital and they were not able to give an answer. She has no images or video of what happened because people leaving the city are forced to wipe their phones by Russian soldiers. Dozens of other evacuees have also said their phones were checked. Hospital staff had been told by Russian forces they could not leave until they were replaced with other medical professional, but Buzunar said new workers had now been brought in from separatist areas and she managed to flee. Now she faces the complicated task of coming to terms with her psychological trauma. “When you are working you try not to show that you’re afraid. But now I’m afraid to even stand by a window because I am waiting for a sniper to shoot me,” she said.",News/World news,Trapped in a Mariupol hospital: ‘They said anyone who left would be shot’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/10/trapped-in-mariupol-hospital-ukraine-maternity-attack-russia
4/10/2022,"In February last year, a Russian gas tanker, Christophe de Margerie, made history by navigating the icy waters of the northern sea route in mid-winter. The pioneering voyage, from Jiangsu in China to a remote Arctic port in Siberia, was heralded as the start of a new era that could reshape global shipping routes – cutting travel times between Europe and Asia by more than a third. It has been made possible by the climate crisis. Shrinking polar ice has allowed shipping traffic in the Arctic to rise 25% between 2013 and 2019 and the growth is expected to continue. But Arctic shipping is not only made possible by the climate crisis, it is adding to it too. More ships mean a rise in exhaust fumes, which is accelerating ice melt in this sensitive region due to a complex phenomenon involving “black carbon”, an air pollutant formed by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. When black carbon, or soot, lands on snow and ice, it dramatically speeds up melting. Dark snow and ice, by absorbing more energy, melts far faster than heat-reflecting white snow, creating a vicious circle of faster warming. Environmentalists warn that the Arctic, which is warming four times faster than the global average, has seen an 85% rise in black carbon from ships between 2015 and 2019, mainly because of the increase in oil tankers and bulk carriers. The particles, which exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular illness in towns, are short-term but potent climate agents: they represent more than 20% of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from ships, according to one estimate. Yet unlike other transport sectors, including road, rail and inland waterways, where air-quality standards curb emissions, no regulations exist for shipping. Last November, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted a resolution on the use of cleaner fuels in the Arctic to reduce black carbon, but left it as a voluntary move. Last week, the IMO was once again in the spotlight. A coalition of environmental groups warned a meeting of its pollution, prevention and response subcommittee that its resolution did too little to tackle the Arctic’s climate crisis. They submitted a paper calling on governments to agree mandatory regulations to slash shipping’s emissions of black carbon in the region. “We’re hitting this cascading tipping point for the climate,” said Dr Lucy Gilliam, senior shipping policy officer of Seas at Risk. “With the IPCC report, we are seeing again why we need to do something about black carbon urgently.” Last Monday, scientists from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned it was “now or never” for action to stave off climate breakdown. They concluded that the international community was underperforming on climate commitments, but singled out the shipping sector and the IMO for particular criticism. The pollution from global shipping increased by 4.9% in 2021, according to a report by the shipbrokers Simpson Spence Young. “IMO member states must agree on ambitious and urgent global action to dramatically reduce ship-source black carbon emissions this decade, in order to mitigate the climate crisis in the Arctic,” said Dr Sian Prior, lead adviser to the Clean Arctic Alliance, a coalition of 21 non-profit groups lobbying governments to protect Arctic wildlife and people. She urged states and regions to do their part by acting immediately to cut black carbon from ships. If all shipping using heavy fuel oil in the Arctic switched to cleaner distillate fuel, it would cut their black carbon emissions by 44%, the Alliance said. Heavy fuel oil or bunker fuel is a viscous, low-grade, cheap oil contaminated with substances including nitrogen and sulphur, which make it more polluting than distillate. If all ships also installed diesel particulate filters, which reduce emissions by capturing and storing soot, black carbon could be cut by a further 90%. However, others argue that the IMO’s 2021 ban on heavy fuel oils in the Arctic – a move aimed at reducing the risk of spillage and expected to come into effect in 2029 – will see a reduction in black carbon. “The tide is swimming in the same direction already,” said Paul Blomerus, director of Clear Seas: Centre for Responsible Marine Shipping, an independent research institute in Canada funded by industry and government. “Many Canadian-flagged ships are moving towards distillate fuels, ahead of the IMO ban, which will have the added effect of reducing black carbon emissions. “You could argue that the IMO only has a certain amount of bandwidth and we should concentrate on decarbonisation and how to get to net zero by 2050.” He also noted the major role that Russia played in Arctic shipping. “Whether they would abide by the IMO’s regulation is anyone’s guess in the current circumstances,” he said.",News/Environment,‘Black carbon’ threat to Arctic as sea routes open up with global heating,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/10/black-carbon-threat-to-arctic-as-sea-routes-open-up-with-global-heating
4/10/2022,"More than four hours after an ambulance was called, Richard Carpenter, 71, who had had a suspected heart attack, began to despair. “Where are they?” he asked his wife, Jeanette. “I’m going to die.” She tried to reassure her husband that the crew must surely be close. Perhaps they were struggling to find their rural Wiltshire home in the dark. “But I could see I was losing him,” she said. She gave her husband CPR and urged him: “Don’t leave me.” But by the time the paramedics arrived another hour or so later, it was too late. Jeanette Carpenter, 70, a stoical and reasonable person, accepts it might have been impossible to save her husband. “But I think he would have had more of a chance if they had got here sooner,” she said. It is the sort of sad story that is becoming all too common. Across England, but in particular in the south-west, ambulances are too often not getting to patients in a timely manner. Richard Carpenter had come out of hospital two days before, after heart surgery. On the night he died he complained of pains in his back, side and arms, and his wife called for help at 10.37pm. She rang back twice more, telling the call handlers that she thought her husband was having a heart attack. Finally, help arrived at about 4am. “The paramedics did everything they could but it was too late,” Carpenter said. Her husband, a beloved father and grandfather with a lovely sense of humour, died after suffering a haemothorax – an accumulation of blood within the pleural cavity. “I feel so let down,” she said. “Is this the sort of country we live in now?” Steven Webb, 49, the mayor of Truro, is paralysed and susceptible to a condition called autonomic dysreflexia that can send his blood pressure soaring. The last time it struck him, he believes it almost cost him his life. “Blood pressure like that can lead to a stroke or death in 15 or 20 minutes,” he said. “Normally my carers deal with it but this time I was passing blood. I was sweating, my heart was pounding, I was in a lot of pain. My lips were blue. It was really bad.” An ambulance was called. “They said it was category one, next ambulance available. Twenty minutes passed and I phoned back and asked where the ambulance was. It was very dangerous for me, frightening. They said they were sending an ambulance from Bodmin.” That was 27 miles away. The ambulance that finally arrived, 90 minutes after the 999 call, had actually come from Saltash, 50 miles away. The paramedics stabilised him. As a politician, Webb understands why things are going wrong – the lack of bed spaces in hospitals, the strain on the care system that means people are not able to be discharged even when they are well enough, the ongoing impact of Covid. “The situation is getting worse,” said Webb. “People are having heart attacks and strokes and loved ones are having to drive them into hospital. People are dying because of this. The system is the problem. The ambulance crews are the heroes. They’ll soldier on through this, turn up to work, do their best.” One of those heroes, a frontline ambulance worker based in the south-west, characterised the situation as “horrendous”. Before Covid, said the worker – who asked not to be named – he would do between six and 10 jobs in a shift. Now if the first person he is called to needs to go to hospital, he expects this will be his one job for the whole shift. “At some hospitals we are waiting outside hospitals for 10, 11 or 12 hours,” he said. “There’s nothing more demoralising than hearing a general broadcast going out for a cardiac arrest or road accident and there’s no resources to send. It’s terrible to think someone’s loved one needs help and we can’t do anything because we’re stuck at a hospital.” There are reasons why the south-west is struggling in particular. South Western ambulance service NHS foundation trust (SWASFT) covers 10,000 square miles – a fifth of mainland England – much of it rural. It takes a long time to get around and hospitals are far apart. The trust also serves a more elderly population than other parts of the UK, and has to deal with an influx of 23 million visitors a year. SWASFT is trying to address the situation by introducing measures such as hospital ambulance liaison officers, “fall cars” dedicated to helping people who take a tumble, and specialist mental health teams. But a spokesperson said there had been high demand for a sustained period. “At times we experience delays in handing our patients over to emergency departments, which prevents our crews from getting back out on the road for other patients. This is because of the pressures across the entire health and care system,” they said. “We are engaging with our partners to address these delays and they are working hard to reduce the number of patients waiting to be discharged from hospital, so beds can be freed for those needing admission to a ward.” SWASFT has asked people with non-life-threatening conditions to use other services such as 111, GPs or pharmacies where possible. But this weekend, as ever, there were ambulances parked outside hospitals – a dozen on Saturday afternoon outside Gloucestershire Royal hospital, another 12 by early evening at the Royal United hospital (RUH) in Bath. At the end of last month, Bath and North East Somerset council wrote to the government expressing concern about the case of a 93-year-old man who collapsed during a classical music concert in the city’s Christ church. The priest-in-charge, Lore Chumbley, a former surgeon, knew the man had broken a bone, and someone dialled 999. “It took six and a bit minutes for us to get through,” said Chumbley. They tried to make the man comfortable, using hassocks – kneeling cushions – to prop him up, and the long, long wait began. “He lay there all night,” said Chumbley. It was almost 12 hours before the ambulance arrived. “This is not the world we want to live in,” she said. The Liberal Democrat leader of the council, Kevin Guy, wrote to the government arguing that “unacceptable pressures” on the health and social care system were putting lives at risk. He said a quarter of beds in the RUH were occupied by people fit for discharge but who were stuck in the system, “largely due to shortfalls in domiciliary care”, He added: “It is not uncommon to see 15 or 20 ambulances queueing outside the emergency department.” Daryl Major, 32, who has fibromyalgia, a condition that causes widespread pain and extreme tiredness, told how he was left in pain for 14 hours after falling into the gap between his bed and a radiator in his seventh-floor flat in Swindon. “I was stuck in the 2ft gap. I just couldn’t move,” he said. “I was crying in pain.” His father, Ian, 67, a former police officer and part-time bus driver, found him and called 999. Major spent a whole night in that painful, uncomfortable position. “I phoned them four or five times,” his father said. “They were very nice but they just said they were very busy and would get to us when they could. “It’s made Daryl feel very anxious. I know ambulance crews are doing the best they can. They just want to do the best job for their patients but they are not being allowed to do their work properly. Something has got to change.”",News/Society,‘I feel so let down’: long waits for ambulances in south-west England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/10/i-feel-so-let-down-long-waits-for-ambulances-in-south-west-england
4/10/2022,"Urgent and emergency care is in a deeper crisis than ever before. Recently, six hospitals put out warnings to patients amid severe and dangerous delays in hospitals, while the South Central ambulance service declared a critical incident. Colleagues in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland all report the same reality. There are hundreds of stories of waits and delays. Patients waiting hours at home for an ambulance or waiting hours to be seen and treated in our emergency departments, and then there are stories of patients waiting hours to be admitted to a bed. The most distressing stories are those of the most vulnerable and elderly. For patients it can be an unbearably undignified and uncomfortable experience: lying in a corridor without privacy, having to use a bed pan or falling while just trying to get to the loo because there are too few nurses around. But hospital crowding isn’t just a minor inconvenience to dignity – it’s dangerous and puts lives at risk. With too few staff and too little capacity, the risk of patients deteriorating and not being spotted by staff greatly increases. For staff, this reality is distressing and heartbreaking. This is neither the standard of care we are trained to deliver, nor the quality of care we want to deliver. This is the state of a health service with a shortfall of 10,000 beds and 110,000 staff. In emergency medicine alone we have a shortfall of around 2,500 consultants, and widespread shortages of nurses, middle-grade and supporting staff. Meanwhile, the vast shortage of carers in the community has a knock-on effect on hospitals, as they cannot safely discharge vulnerable patients who are medically fit to leave. This means beds are occupied for longer, creating a logjam in the entire care system. Emergency departments cannot admit patients, ambulances cannot hand over patients and get back out into the community. Staff now frequently start their shift with twice as many patients as they have cubicles, all waiting to go up to a ward bed. This shortage of beds, the shortage of staff, the social care crisis mean we end up practising emergency medicine in ambulances in car parks or any other space we can find. This is our reality – a world of constant apology, compromise, and frustration. A world of risk and worry when we know that long stays lead to patient harm and even death, emergency medicine teams stretched and working in corners and corridors so that patients can be treated, and teams with 10-20% of staff off sick as Covid circulates leaving an understaffed workforce further depleted. The true barrier to tackling this crisis is political unwillingness. Big problems require big solutions. We need a plan that outlines how it will increase bed capacity and we need a robust, fully funded long term workforce plan. These are the only starting points to tackling the crisis. These would be a beacon of hope to health care workers who are tired of working in these conditions with no light at the end of the tunnel. Emergency medicine teams will always deliver the best care they can, but they will never accept normalising the unacceptable. The current situation is breaking the workforce and breaking our hearts. Dr Katherine Henderson is a senior A&E consultant in London and the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which represents emergency medicine professionals.",News/Society,"‘For staff, this is heartbreaking’: senior doctor’s view on crisis in urgent care",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/10/for-staff-this-is-heartbreaking-senior-doctors-view-on-crisis-in-urgent-care
4/10/2022,"A tall fibreglass tank is under lock and key on Matt Culley’s arable farm in Hampshire. No wonder: the fertiliser contained inside has become an increasingly precious commodity. The cost of synthetic fertiliser, necessary for growing many crops and grass, began to climb last autumn when the price of gas required to produce it began to rise steeply. The conflict in Ukraine has only exacerbated the situation. If Culley were to buy enough fertiliser to fill just this 25,000-litre vessel at current prices, it would cost him £21,000. Just a year ago, the same quantity of liquid urea-ammonium nitrate would have set him back £6,000 – a 350% increase. “We aren’t the most fertile land here,” said Culley, buffeted by a spring downpour as he surveys a field of milling wheat, which will be turned into flour to be used in biscuits. Planted in late October, the wheat’s green shoots have already grown to a height of around 15cm (six inches) centimetres, and all being well, the crop will be ready for harvest by mid-August. “We are conventional farmers so we rely on inputs, whether synthetic or organic like manure, to feed the crop to the point where we can justify doing the job.” British farmers use around 1m tonnes of manufactured nitrogen each year, to grow crops for human consumption, and grass for animals to eat, according to Anthony Hopkins, chief crops adviser at the National Farmers’ Union (NFU). Yet farmers are facing unprecedented costs for this vital ingredient. Quotes for ammonium nitrate fertiliser prices have risen as high as £1,000 a tonne in recent weeks, compared with £280 a tonne 12 months ago. Culley and his brother Daniel are the fourth generation to farm these 170 hectares (420 acres) of land near the town of Andover – growing wheat, barley, oilseed rape and soft fruit – while he also manages an additional 480 hectares for other local farmers and landowners. Some but not all of the fertiliser required for this year’s crop had been bought by Culley last autumn when the price began to rise, and so he decided to hold off future purchases; a decision he now regrets. Multi-year contracts for some of his crops mean he is committed to delivering a set amount of product at harvest time. As a result, he and the arable farmers he represents as chairman of the NFU’s crops board are offsetting the increased cost by making do with less. “This year we are cutting back application by 25% on all crops within our buying group. It saves ordering an extra load,” Culley said. “We have to apply enough to grow the crops, but we’ll have to lower our expectations in terms of yield.” Fertiliser is just one of the three Fs which farmers have to buy – along with feed and fuel – all of which have soared in price over recent months, especially since Russia invaded Ukraine, adding to the squeeze on agriculture. Culley has recorded a 60% increase in animal feed over the past two years, while energy and lubricants are more than a third (38%) higher, and fungicides and herbicides have climbed by about 10%. Rocketing costs present just the latest challenge for domestic food producers, following months of worker shortages, which were highlighted last week in a parliamentary report. MPs on the environment, food and rural affairs committee warned that chronic worker shortages could hit domestic production, leading to even higher food prices, and more food imports. Ongoing and sizeable labour shortages have caused unharvested crops to be left to rot in fields, prompted the killing of healthy pigs on farms because of a lack of workers at meat processing plants, and disrupted the food supply chain, threatening the UK’s food security. The UK produces enough food to cover about 60% of its needs, however many in agriculture fear a persistent lack of workers following Covid and Brexit – while seasonal worker permits for people coming to the UK to pick crops and flowers are limited to 30,000 a year by government – combined with soaring costs are putting so much pressure on farmers that some may choose to leave the industry. Minette Batters, president of the NFU, is calling on the government to help farmers mitigate some of the unprecedented costs and tightening supplies of fertiliser. She welcomed the fertiliser crisis meeting hosted by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) with agriculture industry bodies, including the NFU, at the end of March. Ministers have delayed the introduction of a ban on the use of urea, a key fertiliser used in the UK, to reduce air pollution – and are also changing some rules around autumn muck spreading. “We are continuing to engage with government on the importance of fertiliser and about ways it can ensure stability and confidence in the food supply chain,” Batters said. However, some of the government’s other measures are more long term, and unlikely to have an immediate impact. Defra has offered to pay farmers to lessen the cost of sowing nitrogen-fixing plants, such as legumes and clovers, which don’t require fertiliser. But this isn’t much help when crops such as Culley’s winter wheat are already in the ground. Commodity analysts are warning that farmers won’t see fertiliser prices come down any time soon. The consultancy CRU Group, which tracks commodity prices, saw its fertiliser price index – which includes data for nitrogen, potash and phosphate – reach a record high on 31 March, following the start of the war in Ukraine. “At the moment we expect prices to continue to increase over the next couple of months,” said Chris Lawson, head of fertilisers at CRU. “There is incredible volatility in the market right now.” Several factors will keep prices elevated for longer, including high gas prices and reduction in supply. Last month, CRU estimated that energy costs were impacting almost a third (28%) of European fertiliser capacity, as plants reduced production or were temporarily suspended. The UK produces about 40% of its own fertiliser, yet there are also some concerns over deliveries from Russia – the world’s biggest exporter of synthetic fertiliser, which supplies more than a fifth of urea –which has restricted some exports. Back on the farm in Hampshire, Culley will keep monitoring his fields over the coming weeks, working out how often to apply small amounts of fertiliser, to ensure his crops are growing as required. “The risk is much higher at these prices,” he said. “The question next autumn will be, do we plant this crop?” A Lancashire farmer spoke for many in his industry when he recently won £30,000 on the People’s Postcode Lottery. Rather than splashing out on a new car, or a holiday, he announced he would spend all of his windfall on fertiliser.",News/Business,"The three Fs: why UK farmers fear the soaring cost of fertiliser, feed and fuel",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/10/uk-farmers-fear-fertiliser-fuel-feed-prices

4/10/2022,"My father-in-law, Mick May, who has died aged 63 of mesothelioma, spent the first 20 years of his professional life in financial services before realising his true passion for the voluntary sector, and co-founding the charitable enterprise Blue Sky. In the latter years of his life, Mick also added “author” to his list of accolades, with the publication of his book Cancer and Pisces, celebrating his two chief passions in life: fishing and his family. Described by the former prime minister David Cameron as “the only company in the country where you need a criminal record to work there”, Blue Sky was set up as a social enterprise winning work from local authorities and housing associations, and fulfilling the contracts with a workforce of ex-offender employees. Originating as a few small teams in and around Slough in Berkshire and Hillingdon in west London, the charity grew into a nationwide operation employing more than 2,000 ex-offenders. In 2017 Blue Sky merged with the former Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners Trust to form the Forward Trust, and in 2016 Mick was appointed OBE in recognition of his work with ex-offenders. Mick was born in Aldershot, Hampshire, to Peter May, a career soldier known as “Crackers” for his daring streak, and Liz (nee Parkin), a military wife. His early years were spent in Northumberland before he was enrolled in 1972 at Eton, where his high spirits and aversion to discipline resulted in him being sent to the Aloisiuskolleg school in Germany for one term to tame his exuberance; an exercise that enabled him to see through the rest of his school career at Eton. From there, he went on to St Andrews University to read history, a subject for which he carried an abiding love for the rest of his life. After graduating, Mick moved to London and embarked on his City career where, happily, he met Jill Langham, whom he married in 1988. In 2013, Mick was diagnosed with mesothelioma, the terminal asbestos-linked cancer, which has an average life expectancy of 10 months. Yet, despite the odds being stacked against him, Mick went on to enjoy a further nine years, which he described as the most productive and happiest of his life, many of which are recalled in his 2020 memoir, Cancer and Pisces. The book charts Mick’s love of fishing and his days spent on the riverbanks of some of the most beautiful parts of England and further afield, set against the backdrop of his cancer treatment. Ultimately, though, the book is an ode to Mick’s wife, Jill, and their six children – Lara, Ivo (my husband), Paddy, India-Rose, Honor and Daisy – whom he loved fiercely and unequivocally. Following the publication of Cancer and Pisces, an angling charity was set up under the same name, with the sole aim of using the therapy of fishing to aid those undergoing the trauma of cancer.

4/10/2022,"Lives are at risk because 999 callers face unacceptable and appalling waits for ambulances in England, the country’s top emergency medicine doctor has said. Dr Katherine Henderson, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said pressure in the NHS was now so severe that it was breaking its “basic agreement” with the public to treat the sickest in a timely way. In an extraordinary intervention, Henderson said urgent and emergency care was in a “deeper crisis than ever before”, and for the first time in its history the NHS could no longer stick to its “contract” with the nation to promptly reach seriously ill patients who dial 999. Patients with life-threatening conditions such as heart attacks and strokes are having to wait far too long for emergency care, she said, and vulnerable older people are in some cases spending all night on the floor at home after falling. The rapidly escalating crisis is being caused by soaring demand, enormous staff shortages in the NHS and social care that have been worsened by Covid-related absences, and a drastic shortfall of hospital and care home beds. “The true barrier to tackling this crisis is political unwillingness,” Henderson said. “The current situation is breaking the workforce and breaking our hearts.” Hospitals are facing record demand from patients coming forward after two years of the pandemic, while struggling to discharge patients because of the crisis in social care. As a result, Henderson said, doctors are struggling to find any space for patients arriving at A&E. That is causing record delays in ambulances handing over patients, which is leading to waits of up to 22 hours for 999 callers. In an interview with the Guardian, Henderson said she had no choice but to sound the alarm over the “shocking” and “staggeringly bad” delays to emergency care because the mounting crisis was dangerous and putting lives at risk. “It’s not acceptable,” Henderson said. “It’s a very, very significant loss of that basic agreement with the public about the NHS, which is that if you dial 999 and you need an ambulance – which an old person who has fallen downstairs does need – you’ll get one in a timely way. “And we’ve broken that contract with the public. It feels shaming to me that we’re in this situation. We’ve got elderly, vulnerable people at home who need an ambulance … and we can’t get them in.” The results of a survey conducted by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, shared exclusively with the Guardian, reveal the scale of the crisis. Eighty per cent of clinical leads at emergency departments nationwide reported holding ambulances every single day in the last week, a 15% increase on the same survey in December. More than half of clinical leads (55%) reported their longest patient stay in A&E in the last three days as being over 24 hours, the survey shows. Nearly a quarter (23%) said their longest patient stay was over 48 hours. “The fact that there’s anybody in that category is shocking, but the fact that over 50% of departments have people over 24 hours … that is staggeringly bad,” said Henderson. “There’s no clinical reason why a patient should be there, really, more than six hours. The fact that there’s anybody in the more-than-48-hour category is just unbelievably appalling.” Delays in moving 999 patients from ambulances to A&E and then to a ward are having a catastrophic effect on ambulance response times, Henderson said. Ambulances in the south-west have the worst record of any of England’s 10 ambulance trusts for the most urgent calls for four out of the past five months, according to a Guardian analysis of data from NHS England. In February, the month for which the most recent data is available, its average response time to the most urgent category 1 calls – patients in life-threatening conditions – was 11 minutes and 39 seconds, the second highest since the NHS began publishing data in 2017. By contrast, ambulances in the north-east, which had the best record in February, reached the average category 1 call in six minutes and 37 seconds. A spokesperson for the South Western ambulance service said it was experiencing a sustained period of high demand, and handover delays at hospitals were preventing its crews from getting back out on the road. Unison’s deputy head of health, Helga Pile, said: “The colossal demands on the ambulance service in the south-west are being mirrored across the UK. Dealing with repeated peaks of pressure with a depleted workforce is taking a huge toll.” National category 1 response times have also been getting longer in the year to February. In the most recent month, the average category 1 response time in England was eight minutes and 51 seconds, above NHS targets setting out that all ambulance trusts must respond to category 1 calls in seven minutes on average. Even after 999 patients have been picked up an ambulance, taken to A&E and a decision has been made to admit them to hospital, many then face further waits while staff try to find them a bed on a ward, Henderson said. As well as being “incredibly undignified”, waiting on trolleys in corridors can lead to patients’ conditions deteriorating while A&E staff move on to the next patients coming into the department. Corridors are becoming so crowded with patients waiting for beds on wards that staff are resorting to desperate measures, Henderson said. “We’ve all started having to use office areas and storage spaces that you can quickly convert into a cubicle.” Some patients are having the entirety of their care delivered in the back of an ambulance outside a hospital. “It’s surreal,” Henderson said. “We’ve almost moved emergency medicine into the car park.” She said she cannot recall an April when the pressure on the NHS has been as severe as it is now. Daisy Cooper MP, the Liberal Democrats’ health spokesperson, said: “Record waiting times for ambulances are leading to heartbreaking stories of people waiting hours for an ambulance to arrive, leading to devastating consequences for patients and their families.” She said ministers had “turned a blind eye” to the crisis in ambulance services and emergency care that was leaving many patients “waiting in pain and distress”. NHS England said staff were working “flat out” amid increasing numbers of Covid patients, record high A&E attendances and tens of thousands of Covid-linked absences, while still tackling the care backlog. A spokesperson said patients should still “come forward for care” if they need it.",News/Society,‘Appalling’ waits for ambulances in England leaving lives at risk,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/10/appalling-waits-for-ambulances-in-england-leaving-lives-at-risk
4/10/2022,"Clean-energy campaigners claim to have disrupted supplies from three oil terminals in the Midlands and south-east of England, as motorists complain some petrol stations are running short of petrol and diesel. The government said only one terminal was out of action on Sunday afternoon as a result of the Just Stop Oil protests, and that local police forces are working with the industry to ensure that fuel supplies can be maintained. “Currently all supply points are operational except one and this will allow deliveries to be made to those sites which have experienced shortages,” said a government spokesperson. Howard Cox, the founder FairFuelUK, which campaigns for low fuel prices for motorists, said he had been “bombarded with messages that garages up and down the country are short of petrol and diesel stock”. Cox said the blockades by Just Stop Oil were to blame for the shortage, accusing campaigners of carrying out “a pointless crusade they believe will save the planet”. But Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, said such disruptive protests are the “only way that people feel they can make their voices heard”. Just Stop Oil said on Sunday that activists were disrupting supplies from fuel supply points in Warwickshire, Hertfordshire and Essex. The group said supporters had dug a tunnel under a tanker route to the Kingsbury terminal in Warwickshire. “The tunnel was concealed by a modified caravan parked on the roadside and surrounded by Just Stop Oil supporters. Despite a number of police arrests, five people remain inside the caravan this morning working on the tunnel,” the group said in a statement. At 2.30am, 40 campaigners approached the gates of the Buncefield oil terminal in Hertfordshire and locked on, blocking the entrance, the group said. This was followed at 6.30am by a further action at Inter Terminals in Grays, Essex, where about 40 young people swarmed into the facility, climbed the loading bay pipework and locked on, they claimed. “It is expected that this morning’s actions will continue to significantly impact on fuel availability at petrol pumps across the south-east and the Midlands,” the group said on its tenth day of action demanding that the UK government end new oil and gas projects in the UK. A government spokesperson said: “We are aware that protest activity at some oil terminals has led to short-term disruptions to fuel deliveries over the past few days. The local police forces are working with the industry to ensure that fuel supplies can be maintained.” Climate activists from Extinction Rebellion gathered in London on Sunday for eight days of resistance, vowing to “block areas of the city for as long as possible” every day for at least a week, and on the next three weekends. In an interview on the Sunday Morning show on BBC One, Lucas said: “I am sorry that it has come to this and that this is the only way that people feel they can make their voices heard.” She added: “I think that being on the streets of London has been shown to be a way of capturing people’s imaginations. People have joined those protests who have never protested before. They are doing it because they know we have to leave new fossil fuels in the ground. “The International Energy Agency says that, the latest IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] report says that, and yet this government and this energy strategy … is foreseeing getting out even more oil and gas from the North Sea. That is frankly immoral and said the UN general secretary said that is frankly both morally and economically mad.”",News/Environment,Climate activists disrupt supplies from three oil terminals in England,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/10/climate-activists-disrupt-supplies-from-three-oil-terminals-in-england
4/10/2022,"Students preparing for GCSE and A-level exams should start revising in earnest during the Easter holidays to avoid greater stress as exam time draws closer, according to experienced teachers and education experts. Across the UK close to 2 million teenagers will be gearing up for their exams, with students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland sitting their first papers on 16 May, five weeks away. Barnaby Lenon, the former headmaster of Harrow School, said students taking exams this year have been anxious for valid reasons, and said the secret to reducing stress was good preparation. “If stress is something that worries you, then you’re going to have more stress if you haven’t done some revision over Easter. A little bit of stress in the Easter holidays may be a price worth paying to avoid ‘super-stress’ in May,” Lenon said. While this year’s candidates have suffered extraordinary disruption to their studies, experts who spoke to the Guardian said students should avoid panicked cramming. Instead, they urged students to pace themselves and have good revision strategies. “Current exam students have lost several months of learning and may never have taken a public exam. Given the time they have lost and their unfamiliarity with revision, it is all the more important that they revise using techniques that are proven to be effective,” said Daisy Christodoulou, a former teacher and director of education at No More Marking, an online assessment organisation. Many students equate revision with highlighting notes and re-reading textbooks. But Christodoulou said those methods were largely ineffective: “It leads to the ‘illusion of competence’ – students get familiar with the material they are re-reading but they don’t really understand it.” Instead, using self-tests and quizzes leads to much more effective revision, because the act of recalling something from memory – known as “retrieval practice” – helps to consolidate understanding of a topic. Adam Boxer, head of science at the Totteridge Academy in north London, said: “The best way to execute retrieval practice is via quizzing – asking questions in written or verbal form. Reading your notes is being reminded of content, answering a question is retrieving your knowledge of that content from your long-term memory.” But Boxer warned that students needed to be realistic: “When self-assessing they will tend to be lenient on themselves and say things like ‘oh I meant that’ or ‘it was just a silly mistake’, absolving themselves of the need to do meaningful follow-up. “Instead, students should not lie to themselves. They should speak or write down every answer they make, and be honest and robust when it comes to self-assessment.” Christodoulou said that using a technique called “spaced retrieval” could also improve revision: “If you have two hours to revise a subject, you are better off splitting it into four half-hour sessions on four separate days than doing two hours in one go.” To help, Boxer and Christdoulou suggest students make use of free apps and online tools such as flash cards as an efficient way of learning things like foreign language vocabulary, historical dates or maths formulae. Christodoulou recommended the flash card app Anki, while Boxer is director of education for Carousel Learning, a free online quizzing tool. But how much time should be spent revising over Easter? Lenon said it was harder to give clear advice this year on how many hours a day each student should be working. “Different students are going to have different capacities to revise, reflecting the fact that students are different and students have had different experiences during the pandemic,” Lenon said. “Do as much as you can but don’t exhaust yourself because that would be crazy. Always get a good night’s sleep, never revise late in the evening, because good sleep helps your brain to retain information in the long-term memory, which is what we are trying to achieve. “Don’t get over-stressed in the Easter holidays, don’t feel you have to bust a gut.” David Didau, senior lead for English at the Ormiston Academies Trust, said his advice to students this year was no different from any other year. “Basically, if you want to do well in a subject, sit a past paper – there are commercially available mock-ups – three times a week from now until the exam,” Didau said.",News/Education,"Start GCSE and A-level revision in Easter holidays to avoid stress, say teachers",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/10/gcse-a-level-revision-easter-holidays-avoid-stress
4/10/2022,"My father, Steve Sutcliffe, who has died suddenly, aged 75, worked for the Guardian for nearly 20 years, becoming administration manager in 1980. The highlight of his career was the move of the paper’s printing operations from Gray’s Inn Road to the Isle of Dogs, in east London – the contract for the new print site was agreed in 1984 and the first papers rolled off its presses in 1988. Steve was born in Lees, Oldham, the only child of Edith (nee Schofield) and Frank Sutcliffe. His father worked as a mechanical engineer and served in the army as a sapper. After school, Steve studied for A-levels at St John’s College, Manchester. There he met Panayiota Antoniou, a fellow student, charming her with the sweets he carried in his pocket, especially Bounty bars (even though she preferred green apples). He proposed to Panayiota when her studies were coming to an end, worried that she would return to her native Cyprus for good. They married in 1969, at the Greek Orthodox church in Manchester, before moving to Kent so that he could complete his teacher training at Avery Hill College. Dad embraced the Greek culture and loved Mum’s enormous family, whom he was happy to visit often and help during the Cyprus invasion. Teaching proved to be a short-lived experience. Instead, he got a job in London with the Guardian, as a finance clerk. Over the following 19 years, Steve advanced through several posts before being appointed administration manager. During the course of his work, he was proud to have met Prince Charles. For much of his time with the Guardian, Dad commuted, daily, by car, from our family home in Simpson, Milton Keynes. He enjoyed driving and was always willing to give lifts to family and friends, no matter the time or distance. He once drove his niece to Glasgow, where she was a student, together with her parents who were visiting from Cyprus. Dad left the Guardian in 1989 to work as a financial adviser for Legal and General, before becoming an independent mortgage broker. He loved games and team sports, especially cricket - he was an effective and respected bowler. He was competitive, without being boastful, inclusive without compromise. And he was patient, teaching his five daughters how to play badminton, basketball and chess, never complaining if we weren’t any good, just encouraging us and celebrating our wins, no matter how small. In 2008, when he was 62, Dad suffered a bleed to the brain. After three months in hospital, two of them in intensive care, he came home with a wheelchair and a walking frame. He spent only one day in the wheelchair; by the second day he was using a walking stick and holding mum’s hand. He was as strong as he was persistent. He is survived by Panayiota, me and my four sisters, Samantha, Sarah, Emma and Christina, and three grandchildren, India, Jasmine and Caleb.",News/Media,Steve Sutcliffe obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/10/steve-sutcliffe-obituary
4/10/2022,"The developers of a new app that uses AI to estimate the speed of a passing car say they have been forced into anonymity by the vicious response from drivers. The app, Speedcam Anywhere, is the product of a team of AI scientists with backgrounds in Silicon Valley companies and top UK universities. Its creators hope it will encourage police to take speeding more seriously and enable residents, pedestrians and cyclists to document traffic crimes in their area. But since it launched in March, the vitriol levied at the team is such that they are afraid of sharing their real identities. “We’re getting quite abusive emails,” said Sam, the app’s founder, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “It’s a Marmite product – some people think it’s a good idea, some people think that it turns us into a surveillance state. “I can see both sides of that, but I think that if you’re going to have speed limits, then it’s the law that you obey them, and you should enforce the law. It’s not a personal vendetta against anyone, it’s just – how do we make our roads safe? There are 20,000 serious injuries on the roads every year – how can we reduce them? And the way we reduce them is we make a deterrent to speeding.” One online review for the app said: “In East Germany, citizens were encouraged to report their neighbours to the Stasi for even the smallest societal infraction. ‘Congratulations’ on creating a modern day version of that. If you couldn’t tell, I’m being sarcastic. This app disgusts me.” The app has faced difficulties. Google refused to allow the team to publish it on the Play Store, saying it was not possible to estimate the speed of a passing vehicle using AI alone – a claim proved wrong when the company provided a demonstration of the technology. An iOS version has also been developed but Apple has yet to approve it for distribution and has not given a reason for the delay. “We’re not sure why they would block a useful piece of technology, something that could save people’s lives,” Sam said. For several years, police forces have accepted user-uploaded footage of traffic crimes. That has enabled some citizens, such as cyclist Mike van Erp, to submit evidence leading to hundreds of prosecutions for unsafe driving. “What we did is extended the sort of capabilities that dashcam systems have, so that you can automate the forensic video analysis that dashcams already do. So instead of a human looking at a video working out the offence, we’ve created software that automates the process.” The app cannot lead to drivers receiving speeding tickets. Since Speedcam Anywhere’s algorithm has not been vetted by the Home Office, it is not legally a speed camera, and cannot provide sufficient evidence for a police force to issue a prosecution for speeding, although the broader “dangerous driving” offence may apply if the driving is sufficiently negligent. Sam hopes widespread use of the app will instead alert police to speeding hotspots and encourage them to take more action to prevent dangerous driving. “I think this is a step in the bigger journey of how we make our roads safer and more accessible for everybody. “Having roads that are just too dangerous for kids to cycle to school on, having roads that are too dangerous for parents let their kids cross – I think that’s wrong, and society needs to get over it. Make the roads safer, make them less unpleasant, and then we can start to look at how else we can move around.” Apple has been contacted for comment. A user of the app opens it when they hear a speeding car approaching and films the car passing. The app uses the number plate of the passing car to search the DVLA’s public registration database to find the make and model of the car. From there, it determines the distance between the axles of the car, and compares it with the footage to calculate the speed. The user then has the option of saving the video, or generating a report from it to share with the authorities.",News/World news,Speed camera app developers face abuse from UK drivers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/10/speed-camera-app-developers-face-abuse-from-uk-drivers
4/10/2022,"Saturday Night Live opens at the White House, where President Biden (James Austin Johnson) congratulates Ketanji Brown Jackson (Ego Nwodim) on her historic confirmation to the supreme court. Justice Jackson is happy to do her part, ie, “work twice as hard as a white man my entire life, and then spend a week listening to Ted Cruz call me a pedophile”. Biden leaves her alone in the Oval Office and encourages her take in the weight of the room’s history. She calls upon historical barrier breakers for advice and guidance, including the late Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg (Kate McKinnon) and Thurgood Marshall (Kenan Thompson), “conductor of the underground railroad” Harriet Tubman (Punkie Johnson), and Jackie Robinson (Chris Redd). This cold open plays like a high school history presentation with slightly more jokes, but little in the way of actual laughs. The problem is the premise itself: the culmination of these figures’ struggles in Jackson’s appointment to the court is cause for celebration, not satire. But since SNL is a satirical show, you have to question what the sketch’s purpose is. Jake Gyllenhaal hosts for the second time in 15 years. The actor reflects on how much he’s changed in that time, before launching into a rendition of Celine Dion’s It’s All Coming Back to Me Now with backup from Nwodim, Cecily Strong and Chloe Fineman. Gyllenhaal gives the song his all, but the result is little more than a karaoke performance. Why’d You Like It? is a game show that asks people to explain why they “liked” certain Instagram posts. Pressed to explain why he “did the double tap” for a picture of a hot woman when he could have just looked at it, Gyllenhaal’s nervous contestant eventually admits, “I guess some part of me thought that if I liked it she would see that I liked it, and then she would follow me back, and then we’d DM, and then maybe at some point she’d want to have sex with me.” (This does not amuse his girlfriend in the audience.) The other two contestants are initially confident that they’ll escape a similar humiliation, since the posts they liked initially seem harmless, but they eventually break down and reveal they’ve fallen into the exact same thirst traps. A sharp dissection of the shallowness of social media and the way it’s warped all of our brains. Dream Home Cousins is a show on HGTV in which the design for a young couple’s dream home turns into a nightmare after the husband’s aged mother decides to move in with them. Instead of an “oasis of relaxation,” the house becomes cluttered with medical equipment, “large, ceramic statues of ducks in 1930s gangster outfits” and black and white photographs of “stern looking ancestors.” As the creepy, suffocating matriarch, McKinnon hits several of her most overplayed beats while failing to bring anything new to the table. The Singers Four are a cabaret group (Gyllenhaal, McKinnon, Strong and Bowen Yang) who reunite on stage to sing a ballad about celebrating life’s small victories, such as meeting Z-list celebrities, not scaring or upsetting sexual partners, hating Hamilton “before it was cool” and owning a TV. It’s fitting that a sketch about accepting mediocrity should be so, well, you know. Next, a group of flowers are excited for Spring, until they’re visited by a number of horrors, including horny bees, perverted weeds, urinating dogs and violent decapitation. This never plays as dark or shocking as it wants to be, and the high-pitched voices the cast use make it all very annoying. This is followed by another high concept sketch in which possessed child’s doll Chucky (Sarah Sherman) attempts to stab several coworkers at the corporate office he works at, resulting in an HR intervention. A Sarah Sherman special, this feels a bit too random and rushed, although the effects work is effectively uncanny. On Weekend Update, Colin Jost comments on the 10-year ban handed down by the Oscars to Will Smith, asking “Is that a punishment?” He suggests that Smith should be forced to humiliate himself by hosting next year’s ceremony. A little later, he describes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s televised speech at Sunday’s Grammy Awards as heartfelt and impassioned but notes that he missed “an opportunity for a legendary GI Jane joke”. The show Lights, Camera, Achoo! looks back at “some of the sickest performances in film history”. Tonight’s episode focuses on the tubercular cowboy Doc Holiday, as played by Val Kilmer in the western Tombstone, as well as a different actor in a lesser known movie from the previous year called Cough, Cough, Bang, Bang. A clip from the latter see’s Gyllenhaal’s Holiday interrupting a showdown between gunslinging rivals only to utterly disgust everyone by coughing, sneezing, farting and spewing blood and vomit all over the place. Gyllenhaal gives his best performance of the night as the “Patient Zero” of the old west in this slight, but enjoyably gross sketch. A couples therapy session quickly goes off the rails when the therapist (Johnson) takes a phone call from her significant other and immediately goes on a furious rant, daring her partner to make good on her threats of gun violence, yelling “Come through bitch! It’s on sight!” The danger of the situation continues to escalate, with the therapist dragging the couple into the conflict against their will. The sketch is all over the place, but Johnson’s deranged outbursts and Gyllenhaal’s reading of sexually explicit text messages (which make use of lots of fish metaphors) in an ill-advised black female voice are the highlights of the episode. Not half an hour after Colin Jost made several jokes about Will and Jada Pinkett-Smith, their daughter Willow joins Camila Cabello on stage for a performance of Psychofreak. This must have made for an interesting afterparty for the cast. The final sketch of the night sees Bryant play a redneck trucker pitching truck-themed CDs featuring country standards, romantic ballads, spooky folks songs, and children’s classics, about peeing, running other cars off the road and picking up a hitchhiking El Chapo. It’s admirable that Gyllenhaal was so keen on musical comedy, but this isn’t any funnier than the other song-based sketches that preceded it. A thoroughly mediocre episode, the highs weren’t ever very high, but at least the lows weren’t egregiously low.",Arts/Television & radio,Saturday Night Live: Jake Gyllenhaal hosts a mediocre episode,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/10/saturday-night-live-jake-gyllenhaal-hosts
