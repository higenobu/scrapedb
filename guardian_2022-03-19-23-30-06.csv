3/19/2022,"From the boos that rolled down from the enclosures as Tiger Roll was beaten on his final start on Wednesday to the songs that rang out for every winning favourite on Friday, the returning fans at Cheltenham provided the mood music for this year’s Festival and the effect was electrifying. After the lifeless longueurs between races in 2021, the celebrations and receptions made the Festival complete once again; the record four-day crowd of 280,627 proved beyond doubt that a year away had only increased the appetite for the unique Cheltenham experience. They will spread the word over the next few months, telling tales of what it was like to be one of the 73,875 people who saw Rachael Blackmore make history aboard A Plus Tard in Friday’s Gold Cup. Or recalling the high drama of Wednesday’s Champion Chase in the rain, as Shishkin folded, Chacun Pour Soi departed and Energumene prevailed. Honeysuckle’s Champion Hurdle and the unbridled joy of Flooring Porter’s owners after the Stayers’ were other images that will lodge long in the memory, seeding the ticket sales for Cheltenham 2023. British stables also put up unexpected resistance to the Irish onslaught, until the final afternoon at least, when a first greenwash on a single day at the Festival meant the visitors chalked off one of the few records that did not fall their way 12 months ago. Even after 27 more races and no end of drama and excitement, the 22-length success of Nicky Henderson’s Constitution Hill in the opening Supreme Novice Hurdle on Tuesday still stands out as the finest individual performance of the week. Timeform was sufficiently moved to suggest that it was the best by a novice since it started rating National Hunt horses in the 1960s and “on paper … would have been good enough” to beat Honeysuckle in the Champion Hurdle. An immediate head-to-head with Honeysuckle at Punchestown next month is probably too much to hope for, but the five-year-old Constitution Hill promises to fly the flag for British jumping at the Festival for seasons to come. From the first race to the last, when Banbridge completed the Irish clean sweep, it was a Festival that left everyone wanting more. And that, inevitably, will lead to renewed interest in the possibility of a fifth day at Cheltenham, to maximise the revenue from what is, by many measures, British racing’s biggest week of the year. From some angles, it looks like an open-and-shut case. This year’s attendance figures were 68,567, 64,431, 73,754 and 73,875. While there is some room for improvement on Wednesday’s number, the record four-day total is, for practical purposes, close to capacity. A fifth day on Saturday, in theory, would boost the overall figure by 25%. Ascot’s fifth day at the Royal meeting in June, is now its busiest of the week. Surely a fifth day at Cheltenham would be a similar money-spinner, sending the weekly attendance soaring past 300,000 and on towards 350,000? If it were that simple, though, it would have happened several years ago and while the business brains at Jockey Club Racecourses may yet prove to be plotting a fifth day from 2024, an off-the-record suggestion from insiders in the past has always been that the case is not as clearcut as it might seem. Attendance would rocket but at what long-term costs elsewhere? Corporate hospitality, for instance, is a big part of the Festival’s business plan and is all but nonexistent on Saturdays.

Will the horses be there to fill it or will the overall competitiveness decline? And where do you put the Gold Cup? On Friday, to maximise hospitality revenue? Or on the new Saturday card, maintaining its place as the climax of the meeting but now in competition for viewers (and race-day staff) with Premier League football and the Six Nations’ rugby? Comparisons with Royal Ascot’s fifth day are risky. That meeting’s highlight, the Gold Cup, has always been on Thursday. Saturday has become something of a family day, with a Group One that was created for the occasion as the centrepiece. Ascot is also an hour away from central London by train, and a 10-minute walk from the station. Cheltenham, as racegoers who endure all manner of travel-related miseries will confirm, is not. For these reasons and more, the Festival is never likely to be a jolly day out for the whole family to enjoy. It has an edge: Christmas, but for grownups. The 2022 Festival, as it should, left everyone wanting more. After a fifth day on Saturday, we might all find ourselves joining in with a chorus of “I want to go home”.",Sport/Sport,Returning fans turn Cheltenham Festival into Christmas for grownups,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/returning-fans-turn-cheltenham-festival-into-christmas-for-grownups
3/19/2022,"To read the headlines it might seem as though R&B is in crisis. Some say it’s dead. Others say it has lost its identity. Critics hymn so-called “alternative” R&B, a minimising tag that every artist shoved under that umbrella seems to loathe. But Fana Hues is keeping the faith. “For me, R&B is the foundation of pop music today,” the California songwriter has said. “It could never be dead!” Certainly not with Hues pumping blood through its heart. You may know her woozy vocals from Tyler, the Creator’s Call Me If You Get Lost, where she voiced his unattainable love interest. Her new full-length, Flora + Fana, occupies a more introspective headspace as she treads water after a broken relationship: the opening song, Moscato, about drowning her sorrows, swirls as sweetly as the last drops of wine around a long-stemmed glass. It’s a silkier, warmer record than her shadowy 2020 debut Hues, occupying a similarly swimmy headspace to KeiyaA’s breakout album Forever, Ya Girl or Solange’s loose-limbed When I Get Home. It also offers an understated distillation of Hues’s deep musical schooling: she was one of nine kids in a family that constantly played and sang together. Flora + Fana spans gorgeous weirdo funk, warped synths that pan like pebbles skittering across a moonlit lake, creeping guitar scales – and her supple, vulnerable voice, another texture billowing alongside them. It’s gorgeously written, too, navigating the push-pull of heartache in a way that only the purest of R&B can: “Got them spirits in me,” she sings on High Roller. “I’m holy ghosting.”  Flora + Fana will be released via Bright Antenna Records on 25 March",Arts/Music,One to watch: Fana Hues,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/19/one-to-watch-fana-hues-flora-plus-fana-heartbreak-funk
3/19/2022,"Anew study has supposedly pinpointed the most boring people alive: birdwatchers, accountants, data analysts and everyone who works in insurance. (What, no trainspotters? A major oversight.) The University of Essex research lists the most boring hobbies as going to church, watching TV and “animal observation”. All these things were judged to be worse even than stamp-collecting. Of course, when you undertake this kind of research, you also have to find the opposite types. So the study lists actors, scientists, journalists (and in particular “science journalists”) as the “least boring” professions. The research, published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, was conducted by Wijnand van Tilburg, Eric Igou and Mehr Panjwani, all possessing refreshingly unboring names and presumably blessed with many science journalist friends. They conducted five experiments involving more than 500 people. The more you dig into their findings, the more you realise how intensely annoying we humans all find each other. Not content with dissing the entire insurance and data industries, the respondents had it in for smokers, “people who live in medium-sized towns” and “people who talk a lot and complain often”. They dreamed of being compensated financially for socialising with “boring” people (“£35 a day” is the imaginary going rate). And there also seems to be a thread of self-loathing running through the conclusions. “Watching TV”? Really? If that is boring then millions upon millions of us with a Netflix password are cursed with the blight of tedium. Unpicking these Sartrean responses – “L’enfer, c’est les autres” [Hell is other people] – there is not only a widespread lack of self-awareness but also a heap of contradictions. Take journalists and actors. No one talks as much or complains more. And arguably these two professions also harbour a great many of the few smokers left in society. So how can they be both boring and “the least boring” at the same time? Is it that the activities themselves – perfecting a spreadsheet, creating a Facebook folder for your safari wildlife photography, listening to a sermon – are supposed to be boring? Or that the people who do them are dull? To be fair, I would rather be spared all amateur wildlife photography, especially if we are talking about the close-up of a fox in our garden which someone in my home was so excited about that he had it framed. (It’s really just a lot of blurry orange fuzz.) Surely the key to all this is the second part of the study’s title, “Boring people: stereotype characteristics, interpersonal attributions and social reactions”. This is about our stereotypes of who and what is boring. These preconceptions bear as much relation to reality as the idea that you would ever get paid to put up with someone who makes you yawn. (Actually, this is very possibly the substance of many professional lives and/or marriages. But that’s a whole other study.) I know a number of people, for example, who find spreadsheets deeply exciting and engrossing. They are well-suited to accountancy and they are welcome to it. As long as they don’t try to co-opt me into their information bacchanal, all is well with the world. Because it is not an activity or a profession in and of itself that is boring or that makes you boring. It is your insistence on forcing its significance on others who do not share your passion. When we label others as boring, it’s either because we lack the imagination to understand what they get out of tracking the silvery-cheeked hornbill, or it’s because they chewed our ear off about something we’re just not interested in. This whole exercise is reminiscent of the old joke: “How can you tell if someone is a vegan? Don’t worry, they’ll let you know.” We are not necessarily intolerant of the habits and life choices of others, but they don’t half drive us out of our minds when they bang on about them. My big surprise is that wild swimmers did not crop up in this study. Surely they are the most mind-numbingly boring of all. And I speak as one of their number – although I promise to speak as little as possible. I associate the word “boring” with my 1980s childhood thanks to the TV show Why Don’t You…?, whose full title was: “Why don’t you just switch off your TV set and go and do something less boring instead?” (Again with the TV-bashing and this from an actual TV programme.) As a small child I was repeatedly told: “There is no such thing as bored, only boring people.” The inference is clear: if you are bored, you have only yourself to blame. As I’ve got older I’ve learned to embrace the opposite idea: that being bored and being boring are positive things. I am not interested in being fascinating to all people. If some people think I am boring, then hurrah. It will protect me from their attentions. And if I am bored, then that’s also good. It will give me a moment to sit with my thoughts and perhaps experience some kind of peace. The Covid time has been one long embrace of boredom for many, deprived of our usual distractions, relationships and comforts. Boredom can be a luxury and a blessing. It’s often better than the alternative: the vicissitudes of life. How can any of us be certain of being less boring? The key is to avoid people who are so boring themselves that they can’t take the time to see beyond stereotypes. Instead, why not think of being boring as a badge of honour? There’s something deeply satisfying in being so unbearable to others that they would want to be paid £35 to put up with you. Boredom is in the eye – or indeed the binoculars – of the beholder.",News/Society,If you find everyone else boring you only have yourself to blame,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/19/if-you-find-everyone-else-boring-you-only-have-yourself-to-blame
3/19/2022,"Hip-hop has a soft spot for statistics. On Audacity, a track full of pique at the impertinence of his critics, the rapper Stormzy lists the capacity of the venues he played on the tour for his debut album, Gang Signs & Prayer, as evidence of his supremacy in UK grime. “5,000 capacity,” it goes, “spread that over the UK and then add it up and get back to me.” Except this time around, that figure has doubled to “10,000 capacity” – an edit to the lyrics met by one of the many roars of recognition of the night from an adoring crowd. Delayed for two years, Stormzy’s tour for his second album, Heavy Is the Head, will now play to more than 175,000 people in the UK. With so many certainties upended in the past two years, it is heartening to see the south London artist remains an adored cultural figurehead, one whose lyrical power is matched by the breadth and depth of his offering. Throughout the gig, Stormzy expresses his gratitude to his fans for hanging on to their tickets for two years and spends a very long time after the end of the gig slapping hands, posing for selfies, dispensing hugs and – maybe – signing a proffered blue trainer. Now, he is sitting on an album full of new material, waiting to be released later this year. This is a hefty tour for a major album by a big star and, sometimes, the scale of the production is so amped as to get in the way. Seizure-pitch strobes and a blaze of pyrotechnics are unleashed even before the talent sets foot on the stage. An optic nerve-jangling affair follows, built once again by the team who art-directed Stormzy’s epic Glastonbury performance (and, significantly, Beyoncé’s landmark Coachella headline slot). Hanging from the ceiling, there are moving scales of justice for the rapper and his DJ-cum-hype man, DJ Tiiny, to ride in. Overwrought images of steampunk hearts pulsating in a tangle of barbed wire give way to a hailstorm of sparks and, later, a giant crown-shaped lighting rig. If you film Stormzy’s all-out banger, Vossi Bop, on your phone, the blingy golden globe on the backdrop bearing his #Merky logo becomes three-dimensional and seems to hover above Stormzy’s head: a clever, 21st-century touch. Often, though, these aesthetics feel disjointed, lacking a through-line. Shut Up, the 2015 track that established the South Norwood rapper as a cultural force, states emphatically that Stormzy is no one’s “back-up dancer”. Tonight, it feels at times like it takes all six-and-a-half feet of his authoritative congeniality for Stormzy to go mano a mano with his own stage set. When the barrage of visuals coalesces, however, the shock and awe is seductive. Also from the archives, First Things First finds all the overproduction paying off when salient bits of Stormzy’s lyrics are rendered in monumental stone on the video backdrop, or as glyphs: a pause button, the Twitter bird. Later, on Big for Your Boots, the visuals mock up reels of old-school photographic film stills, which capture the rapper from a number of live angles in real time: classy. If a few tracks have changed – Cold, from his debut album, used to be a gloriously fraught, 8-bit bleep-fest; now it’s just vaguely portentous – some milestones pass with surprisingly little in the way of remarks. Wiley Flow remains one of Stormzy’s most eloquent brags, paying homage, albeit in passing, to one of grime’s most problematic progenitors and author of antisemitic social media messages. But Stormzy spent a significant portion of 2020 locked in a battle of words with his former ally, trading below-the-belt insults in a barrage of diss tracks. Tonight, a video in which Stormzy, wearing heart-shaped shades, sips a mug of tea in very slow motion is a callback not just to his Englishness, or the occasions in his lyrics where he drinks tea while smoking a spliff, but also to the 2020 diss tracks Disappointed and Still Disappointed, not played tonight, in which a white mug of tea features prominently. At its heart, the Stormzy/Wiley dispute was mostly about the mainstream nature of Stormzy’s art, about whether a rapper who hobnobs with Ed Sheeran can still call himself a grime MC. Long passages of tonight’s set foreground Stormzy’s versatility – not just his singing, but his willingness to embrace God on Blinded by Your Grace, Pt 2 and examine his own faults on tracks such as Do Better, or offer encouragement to the next generation on the touching Superheroes. Success invariably means some dislocation from your roots, no matter who you are. But there is no question of Stormzy’s verbal potency or aggression. The gig climaxes in a welter of hits, not least Clash, Stormzy’s double-header with his only real British rival, and good pal, fellow south London talent Dave. It’s a massive flex about the trappings of success – watches and cars – whose key lyric reinforces Stormzy’s exceptionality and the theme of loneliness that suffuses Heavy Is the Head: “we’ve overtaken all our peers.”",Arts/Music,Stormzy review – shock and awe,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/19/stormzy-review-shock-and-awe
3/19/2022,"Before the pandemic hit, I had read that the future of higher education would involve a shift from the university as a physical location of learning to a digital offering that came to you, wherever you were. I remember thinking: well, that will never happen! Even with the popularity of distance learning and digital education platforms to support in-person learning, I couldn’t imagine a world in which the campus didn’t feature as the hub of resources, networking and socialising. Yet that was exactly the world the pandemic brought us. In September 2020, my colleagues at Brunel University London and I lamented (over a video call) how hard the coming term was going to be, how our students were losing out, how our teaching wouldn’t translate online. The main pedagogy of my subject, creative writing, is the writing workshop, by which students read and offer feedback on each other’s work. For students new to this discipline, being in a room together, engaging in what can be a nerve-racking activity, felt very important. No online version could replace real human connection, surely? University is not just a place where teaching and learning happens – it is where young people transition from teenage to adult life, where they feed themselves, do their own laundry, manage their money, find their adult friendship groups. It is where they learn to take charge of their lives. This was my experience of university, 25 years ago. But, at Brunel, many of the students were already having very different experiences from mine. Some lived at home and commuted across London to classes. Some balanced studying with part-time or not-so-part-time work. Crucially, most had a sophisticated digital literacy, which, in some ways, meant they were far more prepared for online learning than I was. Here are some of the things that happened in the past two years. Student attendance improved – in some cases, significantly. With no commute to face, more students logged in to classes – often, I suspect, from bed. Why don’t I know whether or not they were in bed? Because, in the first weeks, many kept their cameras off – until my team decided that talking into an abyss of black screens was awful and introduced a “cameras on” policy. The chat function in Zoom is an interesting place – students who might be shy to talk in class might not be shy in chat. Sometimes, I struggled to keep up with the speed of their responses. My day became full of new language: “Let’s Zoom”, “I’ll just screen-share”, “See you on Teams!” On good days, I had 40 students attending fruitful online discussions, giving many responses to my questions and sensitive feedback about each other’s work. But other words and phrases entered my language, too, such as “digital poverty”, which applied to students who didn’t have laptops or an internet connection. One young woman told me that she was sharing her mum’s phone with her three younger siblings, all of them meant to be learning online. My eyesight got rapidly worse. In December 2020, I appeared on video wearing glasses for the first time. My colleagues and I curated our video backgrounds to look learned – many sat in front of bookshelves. I seemed always to be moving my washing rack out of sight. It wasn’t great, but it wasn’t awful. My students seemed to cope with online learning better than my six-year-old son, who languished at home with 155 “outstanding activities” on Seesaw, his primary school’s digital platform. (That is no criticism of primary teachers, who were legendary in their response to delivering online and in-person teaching throughout.) We have been teaching face-to-face again since September. No mandate was issued on face masks, so the students mainly didn’t wear them. On the first day back – teaching second-year undergraduates, who had studied their entire first year online – there was a buzz in the room. Meeting someone “IRL” is very different from meeting them in a tiny digital box. One student whom I had spent much time talking to over video the previous year surprised me by being really tall. Students’ experiences of Covid were hugely varied, but I doubt any of them would say they were unaffected. The university’s mental health services are now overrun. Immunocompromised students are still effectively in lockdown. In my life writing module, I asked students to reflect on their experience of the pandemic. Their moving testimonies – on feeling isolated, lonely, their sense of missing out on life – reminded me of how we must take care of our young people and understand that, although lockdown is over, the shadow it has cast endures.

3/19/2022,"A couple of years ago, my young son and I began watching the Netflix series Drive to Survive, a reality show that, over the course of 10 episodes, takes viewers behind the scenes of the previous year’s Formula One season. At the time, neither of us knew much about the sport. The British driver Lewis Hamilton had crossed over into mainstream celebrity. But who was he racing? Who ran their teams and made their cars? Where did they compete? The details, beyond the obvious ones – that there is a famous circuit in Monaco, that there is a team owned by Ferrari – escaped me. It seemed distant and alien – a circus going on far away. At the time, this was a common experience. Formula One may be a major sport but it has often struggled for a broad audience. But Drive to Survive, which transforms the twists and turns of a regular season into captivating melodrama, and makes heroes and villains out of its drivers and team owners, many of whom seem made for screen, has shifted public perception. In this dramatised version, F1 becomes less about the cars and more about the men who drive them: not just their egos and terrible ambition, but the tangled issues of contract disputes and parts partnerships and race-day bust-ups and of billionaire owners installing their offspring in coveted driving seats. What could have been a buttoned-up docuseries about technical precision instead became an examination of the sloppier aspects of the human condition. Rage, disloyalty, jealousy, striving – it’s all there. In its first season, which aired in 2019, the show’s producers failed to gain access to Mercedes and Ferrari, F1’s leading teams. No bother. Instead, they created stories out of the enterprise of lesser competitors – the little-known teams battling for scraps – which turned out to offer its own, no less exhilarating kind of television. Part of Drive to Survive’s success lies in its use of its given cast – the people, most of them men, that make up the sport. It is here that good and bad is made. Is Christian Horner, Red Bull principal, husband of former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, really as horribly driven and underhand as the show suggests? Of course not. Though in one new episode viewers watch him ogle a live-feed of Hamilton and mutter: “Can’t he shut the fuck up?” Drive to Survive’s fourth season, which follows the ups and downs of 2021’s racing, was released on Netflix in the past couple of weeks, and has been eagerly anticipated, not least because this past season was a humdinger. At the time of writing, five days after it came out, viewers had already screened 28 million hours of the new series, according to Netflix, and within a week it had become one of service’s top 10 TV shows in 50 countries, including the UK and Ukraine. The show’s success has had knock-on effects for Formula One itself. In 2021, the sport’s cumulative TV audience was up 4% from the previous year, reaching 1.55 billion. A record number of people – more than 108 million – tuned in to watch the 2021 season finale, which pitted Hamilton against the Dutch-Belgian driver Max Verstappen in a winner-takes-all drive-off for the world championship. (That’s a 29% increase on 2020’s equivalent.) My son and I watched that race – the actual race, not a heavily dramatised Netflix version of it, though we will watch that as well. Until that point, I don’t think I’d ever watched an entire grand prix from start to finish. The 2021 finale prompted questions about the uneasy marriage between professional sport and its broadcast partners, including Netflix. Controversial decisions were made mid-race, live on television, creating tension that is still simmering now. At the time, not a few people wondered if those decisions had been made for the benefit of the drivers or the viewers, many of whom were new to the sport and expecting from live races similar levels of drama created by Netflix’s editors. Fans were right to ask: what is real, and what is constructed? In a recent interview, Toto Wolff, team principal at Mercedes, said of Netflix: “It’s scary how much we let them in,” adding, “They create a spin to the narrative. They put scenes together that didn’t happen.” Verstappen has refused to give further interviews to the series’ producers, questioning their integrity. (“It’s just not my thing, faking rivalries,” he said recently.) A few days ago, the British driver Lando Norris worried that audio recordings from one 2021 race had been paired with action from another, creating a false narrative. Sometimes you wonder whether the drivers signed up to the distraction of having cameras invade their personal and professional spaces so brazenly (reportedly, F1 went to Netflix with the show’s original idea). Though even Norris is susceptible to the series’ charm. “There are things which may be a bit too much,” he said. “But on the whole, it think it’s just exciting.” But is any of this terrible for F1? Not all viewers think so. Even the show’s mishandling of the sport’s reaction to the BLM movement – a few minutes of race-related footage tagged on to one episode – didn’t seem to dent new interest. In the aftermath of the 2021 season, one tweet read: “Better to be a controversial sport than a boring one.” In the first episode of season four, F1’s CEO Stefano Domenicali announces: “I have the duty to maximise the value of Formula One,” in a tone that suggests he will do anything to make that happen, Netflix docuseries being just the beginning. When we started watching Drive to Survive, my son was three, too young to pick up on the details, I thought. Because the characters of Formula One swear liberally and sometimes completely out of the blue, episodes often played in the background, on mute. But soon I realised that he, too, had become caught up in the drama. Whenever we went out in our sensible family car, he would expect us to reach impressive and illegal speeds. I remember him once making reference to Daniel Ricciardo, a charming Australian driver who features heavily in the first series. “We’re Ricciardo, Dad,” he said, while we were driving down an A-road at the legal limit. And then, pointing to a car in front of us: “That’s Leclerc. Catch him!” It was an example of how F1 had infiltrated our life. In the end we did catch him – not Charles Leclerc, the Ferrari driver, but a middle-aged woman, her own kids in the back – and as we drove away my son seemed pleased. But the thrill of that moment didn’t come close to those we had been granted access to on television.",Sport/Sport,Track or treat: how a Netflix show gave millions a new passion for sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/drive-to-survive-formula-one-netflix-passion-f1
3/19/2022,"When nearby neighbourhoods went into lockdown, Liu Li started stocking up. The 42-year-old Chinese magazine worker bought vegetables, fruit, medicine and other supplies, adding to stores of basics she had maintained since the pandemic began. Last Sunday a resident in the community where Liu lives with her mother, in Changchun city, Jilin, tested positive. Everyone was ordered inside. The fresh lockdown has, so far, been OK. “I live a normal life,” she says. “I work when there are tasks for me. If there aren’t any, I talk to my mother, watch TV, or play with my cat.” Liu is luckier than some – she works from home and was well prepared. But there is also a risk. Her mother is a cancer patient and unvaccinated. They are now among the 37 million people under lockdown in China, as authorities battle the country’s biggest outbreak of the pandemic. China has successfully contained every one of its outbreaks before this one, through a resource-heavy response, including mass testing, transport shutdowns, and localised lockdowns. But this time Omicron, the milder but much more virulent Covid-19 variant sweeping the world, has challenged the old strategies. On Friday, China reported 4,130 confirmed and asymptomatic cases across more than 20 provinces, including 2,626 in Jilin province. On Saturday, the country’s first two Covid deaths in over a year were recorded in the region. Forecasters at Lanzhou University have predicted 35,000 people will contract the virus if it is not contained by early April. State media says 95% of cases are mild, but of acute concern is an estimated 17 million people aged over 80 – around half of the age group – are still not fully vaccinated, according to an analysis of vaccine and population data. Just 19.7% have had a booster, health authorities said on Friday. They are among about 52 million people over the age of 60 (19%) who have not been vaccinated. Unlike in many other countries where health professionals have almost uniformly encouraged vaccination, in China many of those who haven’t been jabbed say they are following their doctor’s advice. “Because she is a cancer patient and has undergone two operations, she cannot be vaccinated,” Liu says. “The doctor suggested that it should be decided according to our physical condition and living environment.” One citizen on Weibo, the Chinese social media network, said: “My mother has a lot of syndromes, so she can’t be vaccinated. We have been to the hospital three times and they wouldn’t vaccinate her, so we gave up.” Fear of adverse reactions is a common reason among the unvaccinated elderly. “My father- and mother-in-law have high blood pressure, so they didn’t dare to be vaccinated,” said another citizen on Weibo. Instead, Liu has taken other precautions to protect her mother. Before the latest lockdown she didn’t go out much but, when she did, she avoided crowds and wore a mask. “As long as I pay more attention in daily life, things will be fine.” Low vaccination rates among this vulnerable demographic have also emerged in Hong Kong – where unvaccinated elderly people are disproportionately among the sick and the dead – and Taiwan, which is rushing to convince its residents to get the jab before it has an outbreak. Professor Chi Chun-huei, director of the centre for global health at Oregon University, calls the hesitancy the “paradox of the zero-Covid policy”. “When there was an extended period without any domestic outbreak, the risk of infection was close to zero,” he told the Observer. “When people in China assess the benefit versus risks of Covid vaccination, the perceived benefit is nearly zero, while the perceived risks [of side effects and complications] are relatively high.” A November 2021 study of China’s vaccine hesitancy also listed price as a top three concern, despite the government announcing in January 2021 that it would be free. “Either free vaccination was not completely universal, or the free programme was not well-communicated to the public,” says Chi. Some residents have grown weary with the life interruptions brought by the “dynamic zero” policy of dealing with outbreaks. On Friday, footage went viral of PPE-clad workers fighting with residents in a Chinese car park. Online, people sniped about Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Hong Kong “dragging down” other provinces with less restrictive responses. The government remains committed to “dynamic zero”, but there are signs of concern that the cost is becoming intolerably high. Last week Goldman Sachs estimated a month-long lockdown of 30% of China could see GDP drop by one percentage point. At a closed-door meeting of the politburo standing committee on Thursday, China’s leader, Xi Jinping, appeared to acknowledge the toll of the policies when he demanded China strive for “the maximum prevention and control at the least cost, and minimise the impact of the epidemic on economic and social development”. It’s easier said than done. There are signs that authorities recognised this outbreak was different. For the first time, China approved the use of at-home rapid antigen tests, and added the use of antiviral pills made by Pfizer to pandemic guidelines. It also declared an end to mandatory hospitalisation of all Covid patients, and will send asymptomatic and mild cases to centralised isolation facilities. In the tech hub of Shenzhen, Apple supplier Foxconn was among businesses which went back into operation just a few days into the citywide lockdown, enacting a “closed loop” system similar to that which ran during the Beijing Winter Olympics, to minimise economic disruption. But Chi says they are unlikely to abandon “dynamic zero” any time soon. Dozens of local officials have been fired or punished over the outbreak. The Hong Kong government has drawn the ire of Beijing for its mishandling of an Omicron outbreak which health authorities estimate has already infected about half the population. “The CCP’s political legitimacy hinges on its capability to provide Chinese people with a stable and safe life, for which containing the Covid-19 infection is critical,” he says. The outbreak has put China at a crossroads. If containment doesn’t work, the caseload among a population of 1.4 billion people will be huge, and analysts predict major disruptions to the economy and global supply chain. If containment works, it prompts the question: what next? “Zero-Covid” strategies rely on closed or heavily restricted borders and travel, and Covid is in the world for the foreseeable future. When does China reopen? Professor Antoine Flahault, director of the institute of global health at the University of Geneva, says Omicron means “dynamic zero” is no longer an effective or sustainable option, citing the economic impact of lockdowns which also feel increasingly disproportionate to people who experience mild Covid-19. Chi expects China to contain the outbreak, but he suggests continuing spread in a well-prepared setting may not be the worst thing, as recent studies have said natural immunity gives stronger protection than vaccines. “Omicron with high contagiousness and low severity/fatality is a good candidate to achieve this strong population immunity,” says Chi. For now, Liu is comfortable in her lockdown, but suggests she sees a future envisioned by Flahault. She is confident China will prevail over the outbreak, through the current measures and with greater immunity and improved treatment options. “I’m not worried, on the contrary I think things will get better.”Additional research by Xiaoqian Zhu",News/World news,"With 37 million in lockdown and Covid plans under fire, Chinese ask: what comes next?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/with-37-million-in-lockdown-and-covid-plans-under-fire-chinese-ask-what-comes-next
3/19/2022,"Vladimir Putin was “channeling his inner Trump” when he staged a huge rally in Moscow to trumpet his invasion of Ukraine, Sean Hannity said on Friday. On a day when the Russian foreign minister praised Fox News for “trying to present some alternative point of view”, and amid controversy over Fox News hosts and guests repeating Russian disinformation, Hannity also mocked Joe Biden and read out a Kremlin statement attacking the US president. First, on his his radio show, Hannity said: “It looks like Vladimir Putin is channeling his inner Donald Trump. He had a what looked like, it almost looked like the big house in Michigan – their football stadium I think holds 110,000 people.” The Putin rally was staged in the Luzhniki Stadium, which holds 81,000 and which hosted the 2018 World Cup final. As the Guardian reported, Putin spoke from a stage featuring slogans such as “For a world without Nazism” and “For our president”, and told “a large flag-waving crowd” Russia “hasn’t seen unity like this in a long time”. Trump has repeatedly praised Putin for being “smart” regarding Ukraine, though he has also condemned the invasion. Hannity is an ardent supporter of the former president with close knowledge of Trump’s rallies, having appeared at one in Missouri in 2018. That earned him a reprimand from his employer, as did his endorsement of Trump in a campaign video in 2016. In the 2020 campaign, Hannity reportedly wrote Trump a campaign ad. On his primetime show on Fox News on Friday night, Hannity said the Moscow rally was Putin’s “best attempt to look like Donald Trump”. He also called Putin a “murderous thug” whose invasion of Ukraine, he said, was turning out to be a “humiliating disaster”. But he also attacked Biden. Referring to technical problems at the Moscow rally, Hannity said: “Vladimir Putin can’t get through speech without screwing that up – kind of like Joe Biden. “Anyway, according to reports, the stadium was filled with thousands of government workers who were required to attend. Unlike a Trump rally, anyone in Russia voices opposition to Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine they are thrown in jail. “Vladimir Putin is not in a good place. And right now the world is facing an extremely dangerous and critical tipping point. And what happens in Russia and Ukraine will have reverberations all over the world. But guess what? Our fearless leader Joe Biden, he’s taken another weekend and Delaware ice cream, a lot of nap time.” Figures including the Utah senator and former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney have strongly criticised the airing on Fox News of Russian talking points and outright conspiracy theories. On his show on Friday night, Hannity read a statement which was issued by Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, after Biden called Putin a war criminal. “Given such irritability from Mr Biden,” Hannity read, “his fatigue and sometimes forgetfulness … fatigue that leads to aggressive statements, we will not make harsh assessments, so as not to cause more aggression.” Earlier this week, Hannity came under fire for saying Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, was “begging Joe Biden for help” but the US president was too “weak” and “frail” to properly come to his aid. Hannity did not mention that Trump was impeached for withholding military aid to Ukraine, in an attempt to extract dirt on opponents including Biden.",News/Media,"Putin ‘channeling his inner Trump’ at Moscow rally, says Sean Hannity",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/19/vladimir-putin-donald-trump-rally-sean-hannity
