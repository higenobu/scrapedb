3/18/2022,"Mercedes took a bitter blow to their morale when Lewis Hamilton was denied an eighth title in controversial circumstances at last year’s season finale, according to a pivotal member of the team. Anthony Davidson, the former F1 driver who has been Mercedes’ simulator driver since 2012, witnessed the striking change in atmosphere following the Abu Dhabi result and the steely determination that followed from the team and Hamilton in preparation for this weekend’s Formula One season-opener in Bahrain. Davidson describes a team rocked by Hamilton’s defeat, when the then-race director, Michael Masi, took decisions under the safety car that allowed Max Verstappen to overtake on the final lap to win the race and drivers’ championship. “I came back in for the first day [after Abu Dhabi] and the atmosphere, well they were hurting badly, they were bruised, suddenly the tone had changed.” In the fallout in the off-season, Masi was removed from his post after a review into the incident. Mercedes, who had still won the constructors’ championship for the eighth time, set about returning stronger for 2022 when F1 enters a new era with a full set of new regulations and entirely new cars. Mercedes did not enjoy their best testing, with their car seemingly off the pace and difficult to set up. However, Davidson, who drove in F1 in 2007 and 2008 and then enjoyed a long and successful career in sportscars, is convinced they will only be spurred on to greater things this season by the events of 2021. “It really was a big sting for them,” he said. “What kind of extra motivation can there be to try to come back this year fighting harder than ever before? It’s got to be a help in many ways. If there is anything that is going to add fuel to the fire it will be that.” Hamilton is now 37 and entering his 16th season in F1. Yet on last year’s form, where he took the fight with Verstappen to the wire, he is still at the very height of his powers. He retreated from the public eye and social media over the off-season but has come back motivated and eager to renew his battle with the new world champion. Davidson, who is now also an analyst for Sky Sports’ live coverage of F1, has observed a driver he believes is more committed than ever to trying to secure a record eighth title. “My first season in F1 was the same as Lewis in 2007,” he said. “It feels like a long time ago for me but Lewis is back again this year, the same character, the same energy. That’s what sets him apart from so many others. I honestly don’t know how that type of special athlete can do that. Somehow they do, they come back time and time again, better, faster and stronger than ever before. I fully believe him when he says he will come back with the mentality he will be better than ever. He means every word.”",Sport/Sport,Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes driven by ‘sting’ of defeat for new F1 season,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/17/lewis-hamilton-and-mercedes-driven-by-sting-of-defeat-says-davidson
3/18/2022,"Get ready for an inflation rate of 10% later this year, a sight not seen in the UK since the early 1990s. That outlook is now endorsed as roughly credible by the Bank of England, the same people who thought as recently as last month that the peak would arrive soon and be 7.25%. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a fresh round of soaring energy prices, and more supply chain disruption have up-ended month-old assumptions that already looked wobbly. Thus we are in a land where inflation could end up being “several percentage points higher” than the Bank expected only last month. In the circumstances, the mini-surprise is that nobody on the Bank’s nine-strong panel wanted heavier action than a quarter-point rise in interest rates to 0.75%. Indeed, the deputy governor, Jon Cunliffe, preferred to stick at 0.5%. This was a very cautious version of an interest rate hike. Complacency on stilts? That accusation will arrive from one quarter for the understandable reason that sub-1% borrowing costs, at first glance, looks like tokenism if you seriously expect inflation to be at double-digit levels within the year. The danger lies in allowing inflation expectations to run wild, igniting a wages and price spiral. Yet the critical line in the Bank’s minutes was probably this: “Further out, inflation was expected to fall back materially, and possibly to a greater extent than had been expected in the February report.” Well, quite. The peak grabs headlines, but what happens thereafter matters as much. Energy bills are virtually guaranteed to rise again in October (by about another £1,000, if nothing changes) but they cannot keep increasing forever. In the meantime, the severe squeeze of living standards will eventually generate deflationary forces. The risk of a wage spiral currently looks modest when growth is already expected to slow to 1.25% in 2023. But the implied message in the Bank’s relative restraint on rates is that growth forecasts could go even lower when next revised in May. The US Federal Reserve is being more hawkish on rates, but the Russia-related energy shock to its economy looks less severe than the one facing Europe. Let us hope Rishi Sunak is taking notice. It is the chancellor’s job to soften the hit to households’ budgets, and there is every reason to think the economic pain from energy prices will be acute. The Bank’s quarter-point tweak on the rate lever, as opposed to a half-point yank, is justified. Next year’s growth challenge looks more daunting than this year’s inflation drama.",News/Business,"Inflation likely to hit 10%, so sub-1% borrowing costs might look like tokenism | Nils Pratley",https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/17/inflation-hit-10-per-cent-bank-of-england-soaring-energy-prices
3/18/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has put huge pressure on an already shrinking pot of international aid. Aid agencies working in countries with the most pressing emergencies, including Yemen, Afghanistan, South Sudan and Ethiopia, are facing difficult decisions on how to spend their money. Commenting on Yemen recently, the chief executive of the World Food Programme (WFP), David Beasley, said: “We have no choice but to take food from the hungry to feed the starving.” Needs in Yemen are increasing after seven years of war, an accompanying economic crisis that has forced many people into debt and the added threat of desert locusts destroying crops. The victims of Yemen’s war and those of other humanitarian crises fuelled by conflicts and climate disasters have continued to suffer during the pandemic, but spending from international donors has been cut. This has forced humanitarians to scale back on what they provide, including food rations, and it is feared worse is to come. Despite the number of people needing aid having already risen by more than 1 million to 17.4 million this year, and estimated to rise by more than 1 million by the end of 2022, the WFP said on Tuesday it had a food aid funding gap of $900m (£686m). Only 11% of its funding target has been met. On Wednesday, donors pledged $1.3bn for Yemen, but this was $3bn short of the $4.3bn the UN says is required. An estimated 31,000 people are facing catastrophic levels of hunger, according to the IPC scale used by humanitarians. That number could rise to 161,000 by June. The UN food agency has already reduced rations for 8 million people but with the number of those most desperately in need still growing, and aid still lacking, it has warned of further cuts. The freezing of development aid to Afghanistan since the Taliban’s takeover last year has plunged an already aid-reliant economy into a desperate humanitarian crisis. Half the population is facing food insecurity – among them 8.7 million people at risk of “famine-like” conditions. But the UN $4.44bn appeal has only been 13% funded since launching in January. WFP alone is running $525m short of the funding it urgently requires to meet hunger needs for the next six months. Most of the country is in debt, according to the UN, and 95% of families do not eat enough. Almost every female-headed household does not have enough food. The fighting in and around Tigray in northern Ethiopia has displaced more than 2 million people. The UN is more than $300m short of its $957m funding target. The UN wants to reach 870,000 people every week, but since mid-October it has reached only 740,000. The situation has been complicated by the difficulties aid agencies face in accessing displacement camps because of continued fighting. Most families in Tigray do not have enough food, the UN says, and are coping by reducing meals, selling crops to pay debts or begging. There are 454,000 malnourished children in the region – more than a quarter of them severely – and 120,000 malnourished women who are pregnant or lactating. South Sudan is facing its worst ever hunger crisis, according to the UN. It has warned that 70% of people will struggle to get through the coming lean period as supplies dry up. An estimated 8.9 million people, of a population of 11.4m, already require aid. But funding for South Sudan is $529m short. The lean period is followed by a flood season, which over recent years has been extreme and extended, limiting the movement of communities and humanitarian agencies. The situation has been compounded by conflict in the country. Communities have resorted to fending for themselves, including looting aid supplies and attacking aid workers.",News/Global development,‘Take from the hungry to feed the starving’: aid agencies face awful dilemma,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/17/hungry-starving-aid-agency-face-dilemma-ukraine-yemen-ethiopia-sudan
3/18/2022,"Aid workers are racing to deliver emergency food supplies to Ukrainian cities at risk of “medieval tactics of besiegement”, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme (WFP) has said. In a dramatic turnaround for a country long hailed as the “breadbasket of the world”, the UN’s emergency food agency is now trying to get stocks into warehouses in Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro before it is too late, said Jakob Kern. “We are concentrating right now on stocking up the cities that are in danger of being encircled. That’s the rush against time for us,” said Kern, emergency coordinator for WFP. Lack of humanitarian access meant it was probably too late for the encircled port city of Mariupol and the north-eastern city of Sumy, he added, but the agency would try to make the most of any ceasefires, however brief, to get food in. Kern, who worked for WFP in Syria for three years during the height of the war, said the situation unfolding in Ukraine, which has seen Russian forces try to surround cities while pummelling them from the air, was reminiscent of siege tactics used there. “It’s the same system that we had in 2016 in Syria. It’s coming back again,” he said, adding: “You don’t expect it anywhere in the 21st century, these medieval tactics of besiegement, of starving people inside, let alone so close in Europe.” The mission to stock up the warehouses had “started from zero”, Kern added, but was now advancing, with 7,000 tons of food already in the country, another 7,000 on the way, and deals done for an additional 55,000 tons. Before the Russian invasion, rather than being a recipient of food aid, Ukraine had grown to become the WFP’s largest supplier of food commodities by volume, its bountiful harvests providing the agency with more than 880,000 tons of wheat and split peas in 2021. Now, with fears of worsening hunger in areas under bombardment, such as Mariupol, the capital, Kyiv, and the second-largest city, Kharkiv, the WFP is suddenly faced with trying to get food into and around a country that used to feed the world. It is no easy task: humanitarian convoys are threatened by fighting and indiscriminate attacks, the agency says, risks that add to the already formidable challenge of navigating a supply chain that has in many areas broken down. “[Food] is in the wrong places and it’s difficult to move it because obviously truck drivers are reluctant to go to these cities,” said Kern. “They’re either afraid [of the violence] or they’re afraid of being conscripted into the army with all these checkpoints along the way.” The Ukrainian government had indicated it would be willing to give drivers aged between 18 and 60 involved in delivering humanitarian supplies a letter exempting them from conscription, but it would take time for that to happen, he added. WFP’s goal is to eventually support 3.1 million people in Ukraine with various types of aid, either in the form of bread, food rations or cash assistance in places, such as the western city of Lviv, where shops are still open and food is available. A ration for a family of three for 30 days contains pasta, rice, canned meat, vegetable oil and salt. The agency has already contacted bakeries in Kyiv and Kharkhiv with a view to working together to maintain bread supplies. Under heavy bombardment and almost totally encircled, many of those who remain in the capital – roughly half the pre-war population, according to officials – spend their nights in underground stations. In Mariupol, from where an estimated 20,000 civilians managed to flee on Tuesday via a humanitarian corridor, hundreds of thousands remain in conditions described by the International Committee for the Red Cross as “apocalyptic”. WFP is appealing for $590m (£450m) to fund its work on the Ukraine crisis. Meanwhile countries such as Yemen and Lebanon fear that the impact of the war on wheat and fuel prices will push more people into hunger. On Wednesday, a donor conference in Geneva aimed at raising funds for Yemen ended with world leaders pledging little more than a quarter of the target amount. Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said he was “deeply disappointed”. “More people are in need this year in Yemen than in 2021. More lives will be lost. More children will starve … yet somehow, we will have less money to support them. World leaders must not allow this to happen. “The people of Yemen need the same level of support and solidarity that we’ve seen for the people of Ukraine. Especially as the crisis in Europe will dramatically impact Yemenis’ access to food and fuel, making an already dire situation even worse. We need to step up now to avoid thousands more dying from hunger.”",News/Global development,Aid agencies race to get food supplies to Ukrainian cities at risk of siege ,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/17/aid-agencies-race-food-to-ukraine-cities-kyiv-kharkiv-dnipro
3/18/2022,"What do we have to do to be accepted? When will we have done enough? Dane Baptiste has a chip on his shoulder about racism – and in The Chocolate Chip, he’s embracing it. No more apologising for being an “angry black man” – anger being a rational response to race relations as currently constituted. Not that Baptiste omits to sugar the pill with some fine jokes, some frivolous ones too, and a neat line in sardonicism. But the show is unmistakably serious-minded – as with the humour-free tirade about middle- versus working-class racism, which Baptiste brings to a pugnacious end with a “hard to hear – but there you fucking go”. At such moments, comedy feels like a Trojan horse for an act who doesn’t necessarily find life funny, a feeling compounded by Baptiste’s cerebral style: he’s not always the most expansive or expressive comic. But at others, the 37-year-old’s worldview and wit combine into something compelling – like the routine identifying latent prejudice in animal taxonomy, or the surprising racial politics of his enthusiasm for cocktails. As signalled by his twisty opener on black cabs and #BLM, finding racism where others (white audiences, at least) might not even look is Baptiste’s stock-in-trade. There’s lighter stuff, too, as the Londoner demonstrates the other personality traits (a fear of roller-coasters, say) that complicate his angry image. But even when the jokes fall away, Baptiste is worth listening to. On black public figures being mistaken for one another in the media, or on the blaming of white working-class people for racism, he commands the attention even when not making us laugh. Sometimes, I found those arguments hard to keep up with: I’m not sure the career of Barack Obama is the best illustration of white culture’s refusal to accept black people. Sometimes, there are no arguments, and Baptiste dishes up 10 minutes of fun but hack material on the relative virtues of cats and dogs. But when the jokes and the polemic are in harmony, this is a potent show about the stubborn persistence of racism – and the right Baptiste has to be angry about it.

3/18/2022,"It was just a few days ago that Terry Waite told a worn-out, despondent Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe that she must “keep hope alive”. “Nazanin emailed me to say that she was weary and longing to be with her husband and daughter after spending six years detained in Iran,” he said. “For the past year she and I have been able to talk via the internet as I attempted to encourage her to keep hope alive. I recollect my last words to her, spoken just a few days ago: ‘Be assured, Nazanin, this ordeal will come to an end.’” Sooner than either could have expected, his words came to pass: Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been released and is finally back at home with her husband and daughter. Now Waite – the former hostage who spent more than four years in captivity in Lebanon – has more advice: that Zaghari-Ratcliffe “should tell her story”. What is important, he told the Guardian, is that former hostages talk about what happened to them. “The important thing in my case was to be able to tell my story to the rest of my family, not just myself but to my wife and children,” he said. Waite, who went on to found the charity Hostage International after his own release, said that telling his story before “trained listeners” was key to his recovery. “If you’ve had very difficult experiences and you push them down into the subconscious, at some point or other, at a later stage, they will emerge – either in dreams or in flashbacks, and cause you disturbance,” he added. “If you can begin to identify them early on after your release and identify them then, you can process them and they need not worry you. You’ll always remember, always have the events in mind, but they will not be troublesome: you’ll be able to control them and deal with that.” In the meantime, he said that Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s return to “normal life” after so many agonising years in captivity would be both joyful and difficult. “I think the best advice you can give is, once the initial razzmatazz is over, that you really do need to step back and take time to be away from all the publicity – and perhaps sometimes even from the many relatives and friends who will want to see you,” he said. “I mean, you can see them initially but you do need time to process the whole experience.” Some former hostages have “real difficulty” once the initial euphoria of release has passed and they begin to process the memories of their time as a hostage, said Waite. “Not everybody suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and they say: ‘Well, I’m perfectly fine, I don’t need any help at all,’” he said. “But there are likely to be suppressed feelings and although those without PTS seem to have an easier recovery in the short term, some time after their release they will realise that they’re not actually fine at all.” “It is difficult for anyone who has not had this experience to appreciate how hard this can be,” said Waite, whowas kidnapped by associates of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah while serving as the then archbishop of Canterbury’s envoy. He had been hoping to secure the release of a number of British captives, but ended up being held hostage himself, often held in solitary confinement and chained to a radiator, where he was beaten and subjected to mock executions. A year after his release, Waite founded the charity, Hostage International, which supports hostages and their families after they are released. Speaking before Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s return to the UK, Richard Ratcliffe said he was “deeply grateful” for his wife’s release and that it would be the “beginning of a new life” for their family. He said their daughter, Gabriella, had picked out which toys to show her mother when the plane landed, and that one of the first things he would do was make his wife a cup of tea. “There will probably be a couple of days’ peace and quiet somewhere else, and then back here,” he said. “The first thing she wanted was for me to make her a cup of tea, so we will do [that]. “I think actually we were looking at the house and it needs a bit of tidying, so there might be a bit of tidying, perhaps directed by Mummy when she comes back.”",News/News,"Telling her story will help Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, says Terry Waite",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/17/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-release-iran-terry-waite
3/18/2022,"The $2bn Hollywood film franchise Jumanji is coming to the real world in a global deal to open themed attractions, rides, hotel rooms and retail outlets across Europe and North America. The deal struck between Sony Pictures Entertainment and UK-headquartered Merlin Entertainments will involve the development of Jumanji-themed “lands” at theme parks to bring to life the films that have starred Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Karen Gillan. Merlin, Europe’s largest theme park operator and the second biggest globally, runs more than 135 attractions in 24 countries including Alton Towers, Legoland, Peppa Pig World, Sea Life, the London Eye, Cadbury World and The Bear Grylls Adventure. The first experience based on the franchise, the multimillion-pound Jumanji – The Adventure, will open next month at Merlin’s Gardaland resort in Italy. Described as a “dark ride for adventure lovers of all ages”, its opening coincides with the launch of Jumanji-themed hotel bedrooms at the resort. The companies have had help putting together the ride from the London-based Framestore, the special effects wizards with Oscar wins for Gravity and Blade Runner 2049, and the US subsea engineering firm Oceaneering, which has worked on the Jaws, Jurassic Park and Transformers rides at Universal Studios. Merlin and Sony are developing a second ride at another as yet unnamed theme park that is due to open next year. The US and UK are the world’s largest and third largest markets in terms of the popularity of the film franchise by some distance – the second, China, is not covered by the theme park agreement – and so they are expected to be high on the two companies’ launch agenda. The first Jumanji film, spawned from Chris Van Allsburg’s 1981 children’s book and starring Dunst and the late Williams, premiered in 1995 to mixed reviews but proved to be a box office hit, grossing more than $260m globally, making it the 10th biggest film of the year. A decision to reboot the franchise more than two decades later with 2017’s Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, starring Johnson and Gillan as well as Kevin Hart and Jack Black, proved its enduring global appeal as it went on to take more than $960m. Jumanji: The Next Level, released in 2019, took more than $800m. “Sony are one of the top movie companies on the planet and Jumanji is a multibillion-dollar brand which has appealed to guests of all ages for over two decades,” said Mark Fisher, the chief development officer at Merlin Entertainments. “Our Merlin team are already hard at work developing brilliant creative concepts, which will bring to life the blockbuster-famous Jumanji films across our theme parks and water parks.” Jeffrey Godsick, a senior executive at Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE), said: “Merlin is the ideal company to bring the world of Jumanji to life. We always knew it was a much-loved franchise. Fans of Jumanji will be fully immersed into the worlds of our films and have an unforgettable experience.” Merlin has previously worked with SPE to develop a ride associated with Ghostbusters at Heide Park in Germany, and an experience based on the same franchise at Madame Tussauds in New York. The company has also developed partnerships for rides, experiences and attractions with brands including Lego, Disney’s Marvel, Peppa Pig and CBeebies.

3/18/2022,"Widow is an awful word. It conjures up such drab and lonely images; and besides, it defines a woman by what she has lost and what she no longer is. But at least there is a word for having lost your husband. For the other heart-stopping losses that come to many in midlife, and some even earlier – the death of your parents, or of a sibling, or a child, or perhaps a best friend – there isn’t even a word. Yet these are life stages in their own right too, and deserving of closer understanding. For some reason, which may or may not be connected to the raw and unpeeled state of our emotions after a pandemic, a small window now seems to be opening on to an underexplored world. The writer Clover Stroud’s The Red of My Blood, a memoir about trying to make sense of the death of her 46-year-old sister, Nell, from cancer, was published recently to a chorus of recognition and relief from some bereaved readers. After the funeral and the flurry of condolence letters, and the awkwardness of people just not knowing what to stay, there is still the long haul ahead of reconstructing a good life without someone who used to be central to it. And that’s what this book is about. Clover is a working mother of five: she might be dazed with grief but there is still pasta to be cooked, school runs to be done. In the spaces in between, however, she is constantly puzzling over the seeming impossibility of Nell being gone. How can she simply stop existing? The book revolves around Clover’s constant search for her sister, looking for her in photographs and in places they went as children and in the last things she touched when she was still alive. When you lose someone you love, they are suddenly everywhere but nowhere. Decades on, I still remember that irrational lurch of recognition at the face in the crowd that surely has to be them – except, of course, when you get closer it isn’t, and can’t ever be again. More pragmatic but no less quietly moving was the interview Harriet Harman gave last week to Sky News’s Beth Rigby about coming to terms with the loss of Jack Dromey, her husband of 47 years. They were one of the most devoted couples at Westminster, and Dromey’s unstinting support for his wife powered her through the most gruelling stages of her career, juggling small children with working in a parliament still deeply hostile to women. But intensely as she will have felt the loss, as she points out she might have decades left to live without him – and she is trying to figure out how widowhood can become a different chapter in life, not the end of it. “People say, ‘Oh now that you’re on your own …’ but – I’m not with Jack any more, but I’m not on my own. I’ve got my children; I’ve got my friends; I’ve got my work colleagues. And I don’t agree with the notion that’s somehow out there that when you’re a widow your life is over and that somehow you’re a lesser person,” she told Rigby. For all the grief and loss, she said, “people are themselves in widowhood just as they are themselves in the rest of their life”. As women they are very different characters, but both Stroud and Harman are grappling with essentially the same thing: how to find life again in the midst of death, without pushing away or denying the reality of what has happened. It’s a stage most of us would perhaps rather not think about, even though grief comes to almost everyone who loves someone in the end. But if death itself is the last taboo, then the final frontier to be breached is what comes after; the slow, difficult process of learning to live with that loss, which takes much longer than the impatient outside world is often willing to accept. Time heals, everyone says, and there is a sort of truth in that. The wound doesn’t go away but it does change, slowly solidifying into scar tissue that will always be there. The beauty of Clover’s book is that there is no neat ending, just as in death there so often isn’t. What’s left, however messy, is the search for a different way of living.

3/18/2022,"The 9/11 Tribute Museum in New York will be shuttering its doors permanently after running up too much debt during the Covid-19 pandemic. The museum is the smaller and far well less known of the two museums built in honor of the victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the US. It sits not too far from its larger counterpart, the National September 11 Memorial Museum, the better known next to the memorial pools built on the footprints of the twin towers after they collapsed when hijackers flew passenger planes into them, at the site in lower Manhattan still informally known to many as Ground Zero. Since the pandemic, the smaller museum, on Greenwich St, has struggled to rely on international tourism to stay open, the Wall Street Journal first reported on Thursday. In 2021, museum admissions were at 26,000, an 83% decrease from 2019 when the museum saw 150,000 visitors. Prior to the pandemic, about 40% of the museum’s visitors came from abroad. “The responsible thing is to close, unfortunately,” the museum’s chief executive Jennifer Adams-Webb told the Wall Street Journal. Despite an uptick in visitors in December, it still is not enough to keep the museum afloat. “We’ve kind of been hanging on by a string,” Adams-Webb added. The museum, which opened in 2006, has a 10-person staff and an additional 300 volunteer docents. It emerged as a project of the non-profit September 11th Families’ Association and “offers visitors the ability to learn factual information about the events of 9/11, the unprecedented rescue and recovery operation and the rebuilding of both Lower Manhattan and of people’s lives”, says its website. The museum has trained more than 1,000 survivors, first responders, recovery workers and local residents, who have gone on to share their personal experiences with over five million visitors. One volunteer who lost her child in the attacks told Adams-Webb: “I can come here and I can talk about my son to people that want to hear his story. And then I can put it away, and I can go home.”",News/US news,New York’s lesser-known 9/11 museum to shut down,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/17/911-tribute-museum-new-york-to-close-its-doors-permanently
3/18/2022,"A peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow is being drafted by lawyers but a breakthrough depends on the Kremlin accepting a ceasefire, Ukraine’s defence minister has said, as the French government accused Russia of pretending to negotiate. Oleksii Reznikov, who has been leading the Ukrainian delegation in the negotiations, said technical work was progressing but that Russia had to stop its shelling for any compromise to be possible. Speaking via video link to MEPs on the committee of foreign affairs and the security and defence subcommittee, Reznikov said international leaders, such as Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett, were trying to mediate but that it appeared Russia would have to be forced into real negotiations. “We will, of course, first of all, during the negotiations talk about a ceasefire, about humanitarian corridors, the provision of the civilian population with evacuation, with water, with food, and maybe later we can sign this agreement for peace,” he said. “But on the terms of Ukrainian people – we would never accept any capitulation and our armed forces are ready to resist. So today, we could say the negotiations are more or less on a technical level. And of course, lawyers are involved, politicians are involved and I’m not going to go into more details about negotiations.”He added: “I have to assure you that there is nothing yet to be satisfied about. But I hope that we will end this war very soon and of course by defeating the Kremlin.” There are major doubts both within the Ukrainian negotiating team and in western capitals about whether Vladimir Putin is engaging with the talks in good faith. The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said in an interview published on Thursday that he believed the Russian president was pretending to negotiate as part of a battle plan used in both Chechnya and Syria. “Unfortunately we’re still facing the same Russian logic – making maximalist demands, wanting Ukraine to surrender and intensifying siege warfare,” Le Drian told Le Parisien newspaper. “Just as in Grozny [in Chechnya] and Aleppo [in Syria], there are three typical elements – indiscriminate bombardment, so-called humanitarian ‘corridors’ designed to allow them to accuse the other side of failing to respect them, and talks with no objective other than pretending that they are negotiating.” Le Drian said there was only one way for Putin to show he was interested in peace and that was by engaging with “one urgent matter – ceasefire, ceasefire, ceasefire”. “Russia refuses that for now,” he said. “So the sanctions will be intensified in a determined way until Putin realises that the price for continuing the conflict will be so high that a ceasefire is preferable and starts real talks with President Zelenskiy.” Russia is demanding that Ukraine become a “neutral state” and abandon its aspirations to join Nato while also accepting the loss of the Crimea, which was illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, and the self-recognised regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Slovenia’s prime minister, Janez Janša, who saw Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Tuesday evening, told the Guardian that Zelenskiy was open to changing the country’s constitution to satisfy the demand on Nato but that Ukraine needed iron-clad guarantees from world powers that they would intervene in any future conflict provoked by the Kremlin. “If we want a real peace agreement, something which will last many generations, I don’t think that this is possible only to negotiate between Russia and Ukraine,” he said. “I think that’s at the same table, as guarantors, there should be United States, European Union and China.” The US president, Joe Biden, is due to hold a call on Friday with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. It follows seven hours of talks on Monday in Rome between White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi on Monday. In Moscow, Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov accused Kyiv of failing to engage seriously in the talks. “Our delegation is putting in colossal effort and demonstrates more readiness towards them than the other side,” he said. He added that “many” Russians had proven themselves to be traitors. “In such difficult times … many people show their true colours,” he said. “Very many people are showing themselves, as we say in Russian, to be traitors.”",News/World news,Kyiv says Moscow must accept ceasefire as west doubts Putin’s sincerity,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/kyiv-ukraine-says-moscow-russia-must-accept-ceasefire-as-west-doubts-putin-sincerity
3/18/2022,"Conor Gallagher’s man-of-the-match display against Manchester City was a further sign of the fantastic season he is enjoying at Crystal Palace. He covered 12.5km in the 90 minutes and said “I can’t feel my legs” afterwards but they have plenty more work to do because he is only going to get better. The midfielder, on loan from Chelsea, has all the qualities one would want: he scores and creates goals, hassles opponents and has the energy to do it for the entire game, making him a fine teammate and very annoying opponent. In 15 of his 25 appearances this season he has covered more ground than anyone else in a Palace shirt, providing the energy at the heart of midfield to lead them to a comfortable mid-table position. I saw Gallagher last season at West Brom and thought he struggled and maybe that was an awakening for him. I did not think then that he had the speed or power for the top flight, so it is great to see he has improved his physical capabilities. I do not know how the change has come about or whether it is just the natural development of a young player allowing his body to get used to the rigours of the game at this level but the important thing is it is working for him. Getting the right loan is imperative for the player and parent club to make sure it will be helpful for development. A lot of effort and research is put into these matters, because if an individual signs for a club with the wrong coach or style for them it can mean the deal benefits no one. Gallagher has proven at Swansea and Palace what can be done in the right hands. Parent clubs know the quality of their players – they just need to see whether they can perform every week in the professional game. Patrick Vieira has changed Palace this season, creating a more dynamic and attacking style with Gallagher at its heart. They have gone from having the oldest average age in the Premier League to being a team of young and vibrant players able on their day to match the very best England has to offer. Palace have taken four points off Manchester City, with Gallagher scoring in the win at the Etihad. He is already used to coming up with big performances in key games against supposedly superior opposition, showing that nothing fazes him, and that is a quality Chelsea will have noted. These are fine traits built on the platform of desire to outrun those around him. I remember seeing Gallagher at Chelsea because his youth team trained on the pitch after the women’s team – he is very memorable because his playing (and hair) style have always been the same. Those in the stands can see what a player such as Gallagher brings to the team because he is all-action. Sometimes it is hard to notice what a more subtle player offers but there is no mistaking Gallagher’s efforts and that will always lift a crowd. Palace fans must be quite upset that they almost certainly will not be able to keep him beyond this season. Gallagher has probably increased his value four-fold since moving to Selhurst Park thanks to his eight goals and three assists, meaning Palace will most likely be priced out of buying him. Chelsea will be very keen to have Gallagher back because every club wants a player like him. It is easy to see what he could offer Chelsea and – no disrespect to Palace – how he could further improve working alongside better players every day. Gallagher, though, will not want his progression stifled by becoming a squad player, reduced to accepting minutes off the bench, especially with a World Cup at the end of the year. There are plenty of cautionary tales for Gallagher at Stamford Bridge, where talented midfielders such as Ross Barkley and Ruben Loftus-Cheek have struggled to find the right path on their journey through Chelsea’s hybrid loan system. It would be interesting to see where he could fit into Chelsea’s starting XI. He is certainly not in the Jorginho mould and would offer a different style to Mateo Kovacic. I think he could be perfect alongside N’Golo Kanté in the centre of the park, each able to make runs at the right time to bring constant energy to the side. Gallagher has made his England debut before his Chelsea one, which seems a strange thing, and more caps could come his way after a fully deserved call-up on Thursday. Gareth Southgate will have Gallagher in his thoughts for his World Cup squad but he does not obviously fit into the current England system. There are a lot of players ahead of him; you cannot ignore what Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips did at the Euros providing the stability Southgate desires in midfield. I am sure Gallagher could operate in that role but he would need to improve his tactical awareness. He likes to get ahead of the ball, which did not happen regularly last summer for England’s midfielders. Alternatively, Gallagher could fit into one of the more advanced roles but I am not sure he would oust Mason Mount, Phil Foden or Jack Grealish at the moment as a No 10. Natural desire will ensure that Gallagher keeps improving. He will continue to make runs, create chances, score goals and put pressure on defenders in a game where pressing is becoming all the more important. All great players, alongside their qualities, have outstanding consistency which Gallagher will be striving to bring to his game as the seasons tick by. He just needs to make sure his legs can keep up.",Sport/Football,Conor Gallagher has it all and may face tough call when Crystal Palace loan ends | Karen Carney,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/17/conor-gallagher-crystal-palace-loan-chelsea
3/18/2022,"My mother, Agnes Labor, who has died aged 96, was a Sierra Leonean educationist and politician, and the first black teacher in Leeds, where she qualified and took her first teaching post in 1956. She was born in the Gambia, to the Rev Melville Cole, a Sierra Leonean vicar, and Louisa Brown, a Gambian teacher. In her early teens, Agnes was sent to Sierra Leone to live with an aunt. After leaving the Freetown secondary school for girls she became a primary school teacher. In 1953 she received a UK scholarship and travelled to Leeds to study at the Yorkshire Training College of Housecraft (which later became part of Leeds Polytechnic, subsequently Leeds Beckett University). She recalled that she never saw a black or brown face in Leeds until several months after her arrival. One afternoon she was waiting for the bus to return to her hostel when she spotted a black woman on a bus travelling in the opposite direction. She ran across the road and in the nick of time managed to get on the bus. The black woman was a student nurse from Nigeria and the two women became lifelong friends. In 1956 Agnes gained a certificate in education and became a home economics teacher with the Leeds education authority, and the first black teacher in the city. Her first teaching post was at the Bewerley Street First school in Beeston. A year later she got a job as a peripatetic teacher of home economics at various schools in Leeds. Agnes returned to Sierra Leone in 1959 and was appointed headteacher of the Roosevelt preparatory school in Freetown. She returned to the UK in 1963 and taught food and nutrition at East Ham grammar school for girls. The following year, she joined Milton Margai Teachers’ College in Freetown as a lecturer in home economics. In 1970, she gained a diploma in educational administration from Reading University and two years later was awarded a master of education degree from the University of Maryland in the US. In 1978 Agnes was appointed to parliament, becoming the first woman representing the Western Area of Sierra Leone to take a seat in the country’s legislative assembly. In 1982 she was made minister of state with responsibility for food affairs, the first female politician from the Western Area to serve as a government minister. Agnes retired in 1985 and undertook voluntary work aimed at promoting the welfare of women and children in Sierra Leone. In 1990 she was made a member of the Order of the Rokel for services to Sierra Leone. In 1945 Agnes married Joseph Labor, later town clerk of the Freetown city council. He died in 1999. She is survived by her sons, Sebastian, Philemon and me, six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.",News/World news,Agnes Labor obituary ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/agnes-labor-obituary
3/18/2022,"My friend and mentor Piers Nye, who has died aged 75 of pulmonary fibrosis, was a teacher of physiology at the University of Oxford for more than 40 years, and a medical researcher. His laboratory was full of his homemade equipment, which he joked was held together with “chewing gum and bits of string”. He was a talented mentor of students and junior colleagues and worked to widen access to the university among under-represented groups. Piers was born in Perth, Scotland. His father, Leslie Nye, was an insurance executive. After Piers’ mother, Grace (nee Evershed), died when he was 14, he was brought up in Aldeburgh, Suffolk, by Janet, one of his three older sisters, and her husband, Ian Tait, both general practitioners. He attended Marlborough college, in Wiltshire, but re-sat his A-levels at Ipswich civic college. “Hoping to feed the world,” Piers took a degree in agriculture at Pembroke College, Oxford, graduating in 1968, and briefly did research in Swaziland, but, influenced by his regard for Janet and Ian, concluded that medical research would be a better use of his energies. He did a doctorate in physiology at the University of California, Davis, where he kept goats, completing in 1977. On his return to England the same year, Piers was hitchhiking to a job interview in Bristol when, during a stopover in Oxford, he was persuaded to apply for a job there as a demonstrator in the university laboratory of physiology (ULP). Oxford thus became his home for more than 40 years, as he became a college lecturer at Balliol (1984-87), a senior lecturer at the ULP (1984-91), and then a fellow of Balliol. In 1998 he became the university’s course director of physiological sciences, until 2011; he also taught medical students. Piers also undertook research on the carotid body, an organ in the neck that detects chemical changes in the blood (mainly changes in oxygen levels), and on the blood vessels of the lung, and the control of breathing in exercise. He mentored a wide range of biological scientists – up to 85 students personally at any one time – and organised events designed to broaden access to Oxford. He retired from the ULP in 2012, but continued as a college lecturer and emeritus fellow at Balliol. In 2015, he was given the Oxford University lifetime achievement award for teaching. He continued teaching and examining till the summer of 2021. Piers had a wide range of interests beyond his work, including the blues, human rights and liberal politics. He was good at photography and computing. His clothes came from the local charity shop; he cut his own hair. He supported his students when they were flourishing, but even more so when they were sick, or struggling, or lost. He married Rosie Painter in 2003.

3/18/2022,"Brittney Griner’s detention in Russia for the possession of vape cartridges containing hashish oil has been extended until 19 May, according to the Russian state news agency, TASS. TASS reported that a court in the Moscow region ruled the US basketball star should be detained for at least two more months. “The court granted the petition of the investigation and extended the term of US citizen Griner’s detention until 19 May,” TASS quoted the court as saying. Ekaterina Kalugina, a member of Public Monitoring Commission, a semi-official body with access to Russian prisons, told TASS that Griner was sharing a cell with two other women with no previous convictions. Kalugina added that Griner’s only issue was that the prison beds were too short for her 6ft 9in frame. Without identifying Griner, who has won two Olympic golds with Team USA, the Russian Customs Service said earlier this month that a player had been detained in February after arriving at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport on a flight from New York. The 31-year-old WNBA star faces up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of bringing drugs into Russia. Griner’s arrest comes as the US places sanctions on Russia after Vladimir Putin ordered his forces to invade Ukraine last month. “If we want her out of jail, Russia is going to have some terms,” said Evelyn Farkas, who served as the US deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia and Ukraine from 2012 to 2015. “It could be a prisoner swap. They also could use it as an implicit threat or blackmail to get us to do something or not do something. Either way, they find it useful.” A former Pentagon official told Yahoo Sports she feared Griner could become a “high-profile hostage”. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said the Biden administration has assigned an embassy team to work on Griner’s case. In a statement to the Guardian last week, Griner’s agent Lindsay Colas said: “We are aware of the situation with Brittney Griner in Russia and are in close contact with her, her legal representation in Russia, her family, her teams, and the WNBA and NBA. “As this is an ongoing legal matter, we are not able to comment further on the specifics of her case but can confirm that as we work to get her home, her mental and physical health remain our primary concern.” Griner, like many of her fellow WNBA players, also competes in Russia during the league’s offseason. She has played for UMMC Ekaterinburg since 2015, helping the Russian club to three domestic titles and EuroLeague Women championships in 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2021. Her annual salary of $1m with Ekaterinburg is far in excess of her earnings in the WNBA, where the maximum salary is $228,000. Griner is considered one of the best players in the world. She won gold medals with Team USA at the 2016 and 2020 Olympics, the WNBA title with the Phoenix Mercury in 2014 and has been named an WNBA All-Star seven times.",Sport/Sport,US basketball star Brittney Griner’s detention in Russia extended until May,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/17/brittney-griner-basketball-player-russia-drug-allegations-arrest
3/18/2022,"The days of sharing Netflix passwords could soon be over. The streaming company has begun testing a new feature that would charge people to add multiple profiles to an account. The scheme is being trialled in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru. It is unclear if and when the feature will be rolled out in other countries. In a statement, Chengyi Long, Netflix’s director of product innovation, said Netflix has “always made it easy for people who live together to share their Netflix account”, allowing people to create separate profiles on a single subscription. But, “accounts are being shared between households – impacting our ability to invest in great new TV and films for our members,” Long said. The new features will charge subscribers who share their accounts for up to two people outside their household. Subscribers will be charged about $2.98 a month in Chile, $2.99 in Costa Rica and about $2.12 in Peru. Last year, the company introduced two-step verification, a more subtle way to curb password sharing. But the new charge to subscribers will be the company’s strictest crackdown on the practice yet. The end of Netflix password sharing is another shift in the company’s strategy that suggests it is looking toward its existing customers, rather than new subscribers, to help grow the company’s revenue. In January, Netflix announced it would increase the price of its most popular subscription from $14 to $15.50 – its second price increase in two years. Soon after, the company said it forecasts just 2.5 million new subscribers joining Netflix in the first quarter of 2022 – the lowest number in years. Netflix has also been competing with new streaming platforms that debuted over the last few years, like Disney+ and HBO Max, though it still remains the most popular streaming platform. Analysts have said that streaming platforms, including Netflix, have been keeping their prices low to entice new subscribers, though the prices we see now may not last for long. Media executives have spoken out about how the streaming wars have not exactly been lucrative for companies who had long been used to getting profit from both high cable costs and TV advertisers, particularly because of password sharing. “Media companies have had a fabulous distribution system for decades,” Tom Rutledge, chief executive of Charter Communication, a major US cable company, told CNBC in 2020. But now, “It’s just too easy to get the product without paying for it.”",News/Media,Netflix tests charges for sharing passwords between households,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/17/netflix-sharing-passwords-charges-trial
3/18/2022,"My friend Edmund Reid, who has died aged 85, was a violinist with a number of orchestras across his long career, including the London Symphony and the Royal Philharmonic, and was principal violinist at the Welsh National Opera and then the English National Opera. He stands out as a black man who made it to the top of the European classical music scene. Edmund was born in Jamaica, where he was raised by his Aunt Doris. He fell in love with the violin at an early age and gave his first recital at eight. Attending Kingston College secondary school, at 16 he was awarded a scholarship to study at the Royal Academy of Music in London, where he also studied under the violinist Sascha Lasserson. In 1959 he married Gretta Barrow, a fellow student at the Royal Academy of Music, and after graduation he gave some successful recitals at the Wigmore Hall in London. His first orchestral appointment was as first violin at the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, before he moved on to become a violinist at Sadler’s Wells in London. He also played first violin with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic. He played first desk at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, for 10 years, and then was co-leader of the Welsh National Opera and, later, the English National Opera. Edmund’s achievements did not come without a struggle. For many years he found he was the only black musician in the orchestras he worked for, and recalled how, when he auditioned at the Royal Opera House in 1964, it took two months for the committee to discuss “whether it was OK to employ a black man”. On tour with Sadler’s Wells, his colleagues would quickly find digs, but he would be roaming the streets far into the night trying to find somewhere that would accept someone of his skin colour. In 1987 he successfully took his then-employers, the English National Opera, to an industrial tribunal after they refused to give him the title of co-leader, even though he had acted as lead violin for two years. Edmund told the Guardian in 2008 that “when I started, I told myself I wouldn’t get in an orchestra if I played as well as the next person, so I decided I had to be 300% better”. Alongside his orchestral career, he was a renowned teacher to whom many professionals had recourse before their auditions for major orchestras. In retirement he led the Rehearsal Orchestra in London and the Orchestre de l’Opéra De Baugé in France, where he was a genial and much-loved figure. He was made MBE in 2020.

3/18/2022,"The celebrity TV presenter and influencer Alexa Chung has announced she is to close her eponymous fashion label after five years due to economic pressures caused by the pandemic. The label, which showed twice at London fashion week and recently collaborated with Barbour, is not going into administration but is, says Chung, “winding down”. Items from the Barbour collection will still be available on the brand’s official site until the end of the month. Chung noted on Instagram that the decision to stop “wasn’t taken lightly”, saying “the experience of setting up and being at the helm of my own company has been rewarding and frequently joyful, but the last couple of years have been challenging for small independent businesses and ours is no exception”. The model turned designer was reluctant to embrace the e-commerce branch of her label, according to Women’s Wear Daily. It reports that Chung would “do things differently” if she were to start again. Following a career as a model and as a presenter on Channel 4’s Popworld, Chung became a fixture of the new rave scene, dating musicians the Faris Badwan of The Horrors, and Alex Turner of Arctic Monkeys. She launched her fashion label in 2017. Chung’s first show at London fashion week was a hit, with the Guardian’s Jess Cartner-Morley describing it as “London tomboy” meeting “Parisian chic”. The label became known for its outerwear, and despite being stocked in Selfridges and Bergdorf Goodman, supply chain issues hit Chung’s business during the pandemic. While some celebrity fashion lines, including those from Kim Kardashian West (SKIMS) and Kanye West (Yeezy) have enjoyed commercial success, failures tend to outweigh the triumphs. Rihanna closed the ready-to-wear branch of her Fenty range last year and Victoria Beckham’s label has been struggling financially. Chung’s distinctive look was a mainstay of 2010s fashion. Combining unkept hair with pie-crust collar shirts, skinny jeans and ballet pumps, her Jane Birkin-ish look prompted Mulberry to name a handbag after her in 2010. More recently, her style has been referenced in aesthetic movements on the social media platform TikTok: #indiesleaze and the “twee revival”. “Fashion in particular unfortunately suffers from a quite a high rate of people really struggling,” Chung told Vogue last year. “So more than ever it’s important to have people around supporting you.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,"Alexa Chung to close fashion label, citing ‘challenging’ conditions",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/17/alexa-chung-to-close-fashion-label-citing-challenging-conditions
3/18/2022,"AstraZeneca has received UK regulatory approval for its long-acting Covid-19 antibody treatment Evusheld in a boost to its coronavirus portfolio as the British-Swedish drugmaker targets greater drug development success at its new £1bn research lab in Cambridge. Aimed at preventing Covid infections in people with poor immune systems who cannot be vaccinated, Evusheld is already approved in the US and other countries, and the US government has ordered 1.7m doses. Evusheld was found to cut the risk of developing symptomatic Covid-19 by 77% in trials, with protection lasting for at least six months after a single dose, the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said. AstraZeneca said a lab study showed the drug works against the Omicron variant, but the MHRA said there was insufficient data to fully evaluate this. Revenue growth from Evusheld this year is expected to offset weaker sales of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, developed with Oxford University, which brought in nearly £3bn last year, after the firm moved away from its not-for-profit pricing. AstraZeneca, Britain’s biggest pharmaceutical company, wants to make a success of its new vaccines and antibody therapies division, which includes Evusheld, and insists that it is not trying to hive off the Covid vaccine. Sir Mene Pangalos, a British neuroscientist and AstraZeneca’s executive vice-president of biopharmaceuticals research & development, rejected suggestions that the firm might want to offload its Covid shot to another company, even though sales are projected to fall this year. “It’s still the most widely used vaccine in the world and will continue to be a globally used vaccine, particularly in low- to middle income countries where supply chains are difficult and price is important,” he told the Guardian in interview ahead of the company’s annual research and development day. While the shot has been far cheaper than those of rivals Pfizer and Moderna, and is easier to store and transport, AstraZeneca has faced a barrage of negative publicity related to very rare blood clot side-effects as well as manufacturing delays soon after its rapid launch. It has recently moved to for-profit pricing in all but the poorest countries, but insists its prices are still affordable. Pangalos also confirmed in the interview that AstraZeneca’s clinical trials of new medicines are continuing in Russia and Ukraine, despite the escalating conflict. He said the company’s move to bring all lab-based scientists under one roof in Cambridge alongside new state-of-the-art facilities “should help productivity”. “It’s going to be much easier for us when we are all together, in terms of our culture, us being able work more effectively together, but also being at the heart of Cambridge and at the heart of the biomedical campus,” he said. “It will improve creativity, how happy people are, and it’s going to help take us onto the next step of our journey as an R&D organisation.” The teams developing treatments for cancer and biopharma – medicines made from biological sources such as a blood product – will be housed in the same building, while AstraZeneca’s third plank, rare diseases – the Alexion portfolio acquired last year – is based in New Haven and Boston in the US. With 16 labs and 2,200 scientists, the vast glass-clad Discovery Centre, which was unveiled by Prince Charles in November, will become the biggest science lab in Britain along with the Francis Crick Institute in London, and is part of Europe’s biggest biomedical cluster in Cambridge. Cambridge University, two hospitals and hundreds of research institutions and biotech firms are nearby. AstraZeneca’s two other big research hubs are in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and in Gothenburg in Sweden. Until now, AstraZeneca’s scientists have been scattered across nine sites in Cambridge. Half of its 4,000-strong workforce in the university town – those working on early-stage drug development – are due to move into the new centre by the end of the year. Pangalos and some other “pioneers” are already in situ. The rest will be based at Academy House in the centre of Cambridge. The company has undergone a huge transformation since Pascal Soriot became chief executive a decade ago and boosted its drug success rates. Since 2005, the proportion of molecules that have advanced from preclinical investigation to completion of late-stage clinical trials has jumped from 4% to 23%. This is well above the average industry success rate of 14% between 2018 and 2020. AstraZeneca now has 13 blockbuster drugs, with annual sales of more than $1bn, including five multi-billion-dollar sellers, such as the lung cancer drug Tagrisso, the ovarian cancer drug Lynparza and the diabetes and heart drug Farxiga. It lifted its annual dividend for the first time in a decade after record revenues last year, but made an annual pre-tax loss of $265m because of higher spending on research and product launches.",News/Business,AstraZeneca’s Evusheld Covid-prevention drug gets UK approval ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/astrazenecas-evusheld-covid-prevention-drug-gets-uk-approval

Ella was a housewife; George was the editor of the Cadishead and Irlam Guardian, and from 1967 editor of the Sale and Stretford Guardian. Kay attended Sale girls’ grammar school, went on to the University of Leeds to read English, and undertook teacher training at Goldsmith’s College in London. In 1977 she began teaching English at Ensham school for girls in Tooting, south London, where I met her. Kay joined the Streatham branch of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality in 1977, soon serving on the committee, first as social secretary, and then as convenor from 1979. The group met considerable opposition and prejudice locally, and Kay’s many combative and erudite letters were eagerly received by the local newspaper, the South London Press. Streatham CHE was influential, attracting speakers including Margaret Drabble, Alan Bennett, Jilly Cooper (hilariously written up in her Sunday newspaper column), Quentin Crisp, Simon Callow and Cynthia Payne. On one memorable occasion, Kay skilfully chaired a talk by the unpredictable Kenneth Williams and an audience of about 100 people. In the early 1980s, CHE evolved into a more centralised parliamentary campaign focused on changing the age of consent (as a forerunner of Stonewall). Kay continued her support of gay rights throughout her professional career. As union branch secretary while working as an executive officer in what was then the government’s Department of Education and Science, she was instrumental in getting sexual orientation included in the department’s equal opportunities statement. As equal opportunities liaison officer at the Inner London Education Authority, she helped produce a workplace leaflet on HIV/Aids that was accessible and dispelled myths. Both of these were quite an achievement during the time of section 28 under Margaret Thatcher’s government. Kay was subsequently employed by the London boroughs of Lambeth (in its education department) and Waltham Forest (in its governing bodies unit), and worked for other agencies on a freelance basis, training heads and school governors, while also serving as a lay housing inspector for the Audit Commission. She qualified as a homeopath in 2006. Kay was calm and modest, but tenacious in fighting unfairness. She enjoyed swimming, walking, music and gardening, and always carried her daily copy of the Guardian, folded into readable chunks. Her real forte, though, was friendship.

3/18/2022,"My friend Michael MacLeod, who has died aged 93, was an art historian with a strong interest in the work of the British artist Thomas Hennell. His book, Thomas Hennell: Countryman, Artist and Writer (1988), was the first to be published on his subject, and persuasively presented Hennell as an artist of rare achievement. Michael was born in Eltham, south-east London, to Frances (nee Wix) and Norman MacLeod, a captain in the First Gurkha Rifles who subsequently became first secretary at the British legation in Kathmandu in Nepal. Michael and his older brother, Ian, consequently spent much of their early childhood in Nepal and India before they were sent back to Britain in 1936 to board at Westerleigh prep school in Hastings. Their parents remained in India, and the brothers did not see them again until 1940, when they sailed back to Bombay (now Mumbai). Michael spent the next five years at the Bishop Cotton school in Shimla, in the foothills of the Himalayas, a time he remembered fondly. He returned to Britain in 1946 when he was 18, and was called up for national service as a second lieutenant in the North Staffordshire regiment, with postings in Egypt and Aden between 1947 and 1950. After the army he studied painting at Hastings School of Art, where the principal, the artist Vincent Lines, who had been one of Hennell’s closest friends, introduced him to the artist’s work. Michael then did teacher training at Brighton and, in the early 1950s, became a teacher of life drawing at Staffordshire College of Art. There he met Audrey Thornton, one of his students, and they married in 1959. He was a talented artist, particularly as a sculptor and printmaker, but was also interested in other people’s art. From 1964 to 1966 he studied art history at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, and in 1966 he became lecturer in art history at Goldsmiths, University of London – a post he held until his retirement in 1984. His book about Hennell was a brilliant and deeply thoughtful study, and was researched and written over a decade when those who knew Hennell, who died in 1945, were still living. Michael was intellectually curious, diligent, modest and kind. It says much about him that he extended such a welcome to me when I began to research my own book about Hennell in 2013. My experience of writing that book was immeasurably improved by his support and encouragement, not to mention the delicious vegetarian home-cooked lunches that he and Audrey gave me. Michael was 45 years my senior, but the generational difference was absolutely no impediment to a lovely friendship. He is survived by Audrey, their four children, Dominic, Lucy, Edmund and Daniel, five grandchildren and his younger brother, Keith.",Arts/Art and design,Michael MacLeod obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/17/michael-macleod-obituary
3/18/2022,"My father, Peter Lewis, who has died aged 76 of cancer, was a forensic engineer, Open University lecturer, expert witness and author. His investigations into product failures contributed to safer designs for a number of household items, manufacturing products and medical devices. He was born in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, son of Rhys Lewis, a former coal miner who became a college history lecturer, and his wife, Louise (nee Jorgensen), who was a secretary for a publisher. After completing his schooling at the Forest grammar school in Winnersh, Berkshire, Peter went to the University of Manchester in 1963 to study chemistry, and stayed there to complete his PhD. An interest in Roman mining techniques led him to collaborate with the archaeologist Barri Jones and together they undertook extensive survey work on Roman gold mines in Spain (Las Médulas) and Wales (Dolaucothi). Their excavations and research transformed the knowledge about these sites and continue to inform scholars today. In the early 1970s Peter conducted postdoctoral work in the US, at DuPont experimentation centre in Delaware, before returning to Manchester University to lecture in polymer science in the department of metallurgy. Shortly afterwards he moved to work at the new Open University campus in Milton Keynes, where he remained for the rest of his career. Peter also pursued a parallel career in forensic engineering, acting as an expert witness in legal disputes involving product failures, often where serious injury had occurred. He would establish the cause of the failure and relished the opportunity to be cross-examined. Among many others, he investigated material failures in batteries, fuel pipes, hot water bottles, step-ladders, Stanley knives, breast implants, catheters, breathing tubes and sutures. His contributions in this field helped to reduce malpractice in design and manufacturing, thus improving safety for consumers. He later focused on metal fatigue in cast iron structures and wrote three books on railway disasters and bridge collapse. He conducted a thorough reinvestigation of the Tay Bridge disaster of 1879. Using digital technology to reexamine original photographs of the bridge, he found that metal fatigue had played a significant role in the collapse. He went on to investigate the Dee Bridge disaster of 1847 and the railway accident at Shipton-on-Cherwell in 1874. He never retired, but he found great enjoyment as a grandad in his later years. He loved the outdoors and was a very keen gardener and forager – particularly wild mushrooms and sloes. He loved hill walking and mountaineering, and was a lifelong enthusiast of classical music. His house was full of books and he read widely on history, politics, art, science and archaeology. Peter is survived by his four children, Patrick, David, Roger and me, from his marriage to Shelagh (nee Grealey), which ended in divorce, and by his six grandchildren.",News/Technology,Peter Lewis obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/17/peter-lewis-obituary
