1/26/2022,"Prospective Australian citizens are routinely waiting more than a year for their applications to be processed, with one in 10 experiencing delays of at least two years, latest figures show. As more than 16,000 people prepared to become citizens with hundreds of citizenship ceremonies being held around Australia on Wednesday, the federal government faced fresh criticism about the backlog in processing applications.  “Today, thousands of people will become Australian citizens, an occurrence of great joy to them and of great benefit to our nation,” the opposition’s spokesperson for multicultural affairs, Andrew Giles, said. “But it is unacceptable that too many people are waiting too long for their journey to Australian citizenship to be finalised.” The average processing time for citizenship by conferral was 13 months from date of application to the decision, a spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs said. The latest departmental figures show some of these applications take two or more years, with 90% of applications processed within 24 months. The department had on its books 144,847 applications for Australian citizenship by conferral as of last month, down from a peak of 163,000 in September 2020. Giles, who is also the shadow minister assisting for immigration and citizenship, said the long processing times showed “an ongoing lack of interest by the Morrison government in who we are as a multicultural nation”. He said citizenship gave people the right to be heard at the ballot box and it was “appalling” that nearly 150,000 people were “being denied their chance to have their say” at the looming federal election. “Through the pandemic there has been a great opportunity to clear the unacceptable backlog yet the numbers remain unacceptably high even now,” Giles said. “This is hurting individuals and damaging our social fabric as people are denied belonging and denied their say. It’s not good enough.” The Department of Home Affairs said Covid-19 risks and restrictions continued to disrupt face-to-face services, such as citizenship test appointments, “to varying extents in different locations over time”. “The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on face-to-face client services means processing times are highly variable across the country,” a spokesperson for the department said.

More than 314,000 people across Australia have acquired Australian citizenship through online or in-person ceremonies between January 2020 and December 2021. That figure includes 133,416 people who have become citizens via online ceremonies since the virtual option was introduced in March 2020. More than 16,000 people from about 150 nations were invited to join one of more than 400 citizenship ceremonies on Wednesday. The government has encouraged councils to conduct online citizenship ceremonies if Covid-19 restrictions prevent in-person ones. Wednesday’s figure of 16,000 compares with 25,422 people who were conferred with citizenship at ceremonies on Australia Day 2020 – a month before the Morrison government declared a pandemic. There were 12,561 conferees on Australia Day 2021, including 826 in online ceremonies. The minister for immigration and citizenship, Alex Hawke, said citizenship ceremonies were “an opportunity to welcome new citizens and celebrate the democratic values that make us proud to be Australians”. Hawke, who presided over a citizenship ceremony at the City of Parramatta Council, said Australia Day “holds special significance for hundreds of thousands of people who previously made the Australian citizenship pledge on this day”. “Choosing to become an Australian citizen means embracing the privileges, rights, and responsibilities that come with Australian citizenship, and committing to our national values that are based on respect, freedom, democracy and equality.” Processing times have jumped around throughout the course of the pandemic. In August 2020, 90% of applications for Australian citizenship by conferral were decided within 28 months – an increase from 21 months at the beginning of 2020. The processing times were beginning to improve at the start of 2021, when figures showed 90% of applications were being decided within 17 months. But that figure has now increased again to 24 months as of December 2021. Apart from Covid-19 disruptions to citizenship tests, the Department of Home Affairs argues factors that can affect processing times include how promptly the applicant responds to requests for more information. The department also cites the time it takes for other agencies to assist with character and national security-related checks.",News/Australia news,One in 10 people waiting to become Australian citizens face delays of more than two years,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/26/one-in-10-people-waiting-to-become-australian-citizens-face-delays-of-more-than-two-years
1/26/2022,"As Boris Johnson prepares to face possibly the most difficult days of his premiership, the front pages are awash with questions over whether he can survive. As well as a police investigation into allegations of law-breaking at the heart of government, the prime minister is also facing the imminent release of the Gray report.  Many Tory MPs are awaiting Gray’s findings before deciding whether to add their names to those calling for a vote of no confidence. The Mirror headlines with “Number’s up, PM” and reports that “Sue Gray has pics of Johnson with wine bottles at No 10 parties as police launch criminal probe.” The paper says the PM’s political future is “hanging in the balance” and claims the Gray report may be published as soon as Wednesday. Tomorrow’s front page: Number's up, PM #TomorrowsPapersToday https://t.co/Z4Wa8boKj5 pic.twitter.com/Clhn8DtN0n The Guardian takes a similar line, describing the unfolding chaos as “PM’s peril: report looms as police step in over parties”. The paper says Johnson is “braced for the most perilous 48 hours of his premiership” ahead of the inquiry’s findings.

Front page: Yes PM, we all want 'line drawn' under partygate. #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/iEoR7q1o9g The Sun also focuses on Scotland Yard’s investigation into Downing Street parties under the headline “cops probe partygate”. “Ten Downing Street is now a crime scene after cops yesterday launched a probe into the Partygate scandal,” the paper continues. “PM Boris Johnson faces a police interview over boozy parties during lockdown after Whitehall investigator Sue Gray handed a dossier of rule-breaking allegations to the Met.” Tomorrow's front page: Boris Johnson faces police interview over boozy lockdown parties as 10 Downing Street becomes crime scenehttps://t.co/a1ILWcaKaQ pic.twitter.com/Vzvqh0Qspw The i newspaper leads with the Metropolitan Police investigation above a photo of an anxious-looking PM.

1/26/2022,"When I was younger, the Australian Open lit up my family’s lounge room. The blue court light reflected off the walls each time a racquet greeted a tennis ball – thwack. It was normal to address players by their last name: Federer, Williams, Nadal, Clijsters, Tsonga. And like many others, tennis was my alarm clock for summer. But in 2015 another name joined our vocabulary: Alcott. It’s a name that needs little introduction and is rarely met with a question mark. Dylan Alcott: the first man in tennis history to win a golden slam. Alcott: the guy who crowd-surfed at a music festival in his wheelchair. Alcott: who quoted Wu-Tang Clan lyrics on ABC’s Q+A. And most recently, Alcott: the first person with a visible disability to be named Australian of the Year in the award’s 62-year history.  In November, Alcott announced this Australian Open would be his final – and he’s currently on track to take his eighth consecutive title at the tournament. Over the span of his career, wheelchair tennis has been shot into the spotlight. But Alcott’s legacy isn’t centred on winning. It’s on changing perceptions of people with disability like him, like me, like so many others. In his acceptance speech for Australian of the Year, Alcott said: “I love my disability, it’s the best thing to happen to me … I love the person I am.” Alcott openly speaks about his struggles and his personal life, all with self-deprecating humour. You can’t turn away, because this man wears his life and heart on his sleeve. With thousands of social media followers, Alcott’s appeal is far-reaching. People look to Alcott, the whole person. They see his disability and its wonderful complexity as part of the human condition. He has normalised disability and made us feel seen – that we can be represented and seen as real, everyday people. Alcott has spoken previously about having no disabled people in the media for him to look up to when he was growing up. “When I turned on the TV or the radio and flicked to the newspaper, I never saw anyone like me. That’s what I struggled with the most,” he said. Disability advocate and writer Hannah Diviney tweeted after Alcott’s first-round match: “If you had told Younger Hannah that one day she’d spend a Sunday night with her family watching people who looked like her play tennis on mainstream TV, she’d never have believed you.” Growing up, I felt much the same as Alcott and Diviney. Not seeing anyone like you in the media can leave you feeling as though there is no one like you and that you can’t be successful. During high school I didn’t believe in myself. I was afraid of life and didn’t know if there was a space for me in it. Alcott once said that for “every one thing you can’t do there’s 10,000 others that you can”. And he’s made society believe this about people with disability too. He has taken us on a journey to recognise individuals for their humour, their passion, their ability. He – as well as many disability advocates – have moved the dial towards inclusion. I know this is just the beginning of change, that there’s still work to be done to have people with disability included in education settings and the workplace, true representation in the media and in leadership across Australia. We need to get to a place where people look around and ask if people with disabilities are truly represented in their community, their friendship circles, who they date and the media they consume. Now when I watch tennis, I see myself reflected on the court. I’m seen on Rod Laver Arena, on the banner at Melbourne Park, in the commentator’s box. And now in his role as Australian of the Year, people with disability are reflected in that role too. Win or lose, Alcott has helped change the narrative for people with disability, and I want to thank him for this. Enjoy those guilt-free beers, Dylan.
