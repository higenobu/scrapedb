3/21/2022,"Ayear to the day before this performance, Griff won the 2021 Brit awards Rising Star poll, and her star has duly risen. The pace hasn’t been as meteoric as for previous winners such as Adele and Florence + the Machine, but tonight’s showing proves that the singer/guitarist/keyboardist born Sarah Griffiths has done the groundwork. By the simple devices of a memorable “bubble” ponytail and challenging clothes – tonight it’s bodice-to-knee ruffles – she’s made herself recognisable, as confirmed by a flock of style magazine front covers. Meanwhile, her mainly self-written and self-produced electropop, which tends to focus on the dark corners of past relationships, is arrestingly moreish, and her on stage presence is confident and funny. Receiving a framed tapestry from someone in the front row, she’s genuinely delighted: “A cross-stitch! I want people to see it!” When another admirer hands her flowers, she carries them as she wafts across the stage. The more meaningful fan endorsement, though, is a roomful of people singing along, especially during the surging heartbreak bop Black Hole. The only thing she’s failed to secure is a breakout hit, but when that happens, as seems likely given the adhesive quality of her big choruses, she’ll be a welcome addition to the upper reaches. She’s ready now; heaven knows why Black Hole, released last year, wasn’t it. After debuting in the Top 20, it dropped straight out, which is hard to fathom as you witness this sold-out room gustily baying the whole thing back at her. Backed by a drummer and a keyboardist, she packs a dozen songs into 60 minutes, playing her debut mixtape One Foot in Front of the Other in its entirety and bulking things out with other singles, including her 90s R&Bish collaboration with Sigrid, Head on Fire. It feels thin without Sigrid’s lacy vocal counterpointing Griff’s deeper one, but is a rare dud in a set full of pleasures. Chief among those comes toward the end with Sound of Your Voice, when she loops her voice, building a choir of ethereal sighs as the audience falls silent. Suddenly she stops mid-“ah”, adjusts the loop pedal and continues, unperturbed. What’s not to like about this characterful star-to-be?

3/21/2022,"Quietly confident in testing, Ferrari played down expectations before the season opener. After Bahrain though their form cannot be denied and on this performance they are title contenders. The car is fundamentally quick and is a well-balanced platform at which they can begin to throw upgrades as fast as Maranello can churn them out. Equally, in Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz they have a driver pairing more than capable of making a tilt at titles. Leclerc, especially in the manner of his victory, was superb. Calm, confident and driving with steely grit, he has made unforced errors in the past but there were none in Bahrain. Best of all was his no-nonsense precision in the thrilling scrap with Max Verstappen. The Dutchman is used to muscling around the track but when they went wheel to wheel and Leclerc came back at him, particularly at turn four – heading to the outside, braking late and then turning in across Verstappen – he laid down his own marker in emphatic terms. Third and fourth for Lewis Hamilton and George Russell with a 27-point haul was realistically far more than the team might have anticipated. They did so well because both the Red Bulls they were trailing retired. Had they not, Mercedes were very firmly the third fastest cars on the track and by some distance off the pace of Ferrari and Red Bull, indeed to the tune of a full pitstop behind Leclerc by mid-distance. Their problem is the porpoising – bouncing – caused by their ground-effect aero stalling on the straights. Team principal Toto Wolff admitted that even contemplating fighting for the championship at this stage is not viable. Yet Wolff, Hamilton and Russell still all exude a quiet calm. There is confidence in the team they will solve the issue, but it will clearly not be in the immediate future. More pain is likely in store in Saudi Arabia and Australia at very least but there is also the suggestion that when the car comes good it will boast fearsome downforce and pace. If they can stay in touch with the leaders until then and with 23 races planned, no one is writing off the silver arrows just yet. Another key factor in Ferrari’s success was the step forwards they have clearly made with their engine, a fact emphatically backed up by the similar pace shown in the Ferrari-engined Haas and Alfa Romeo cars. The turnaround at Haas has been a truly remarkable tale. Pointless last season as they focused on building this year’s car, their season opened in the turmoil of dropping their Russian title sponsor and its pay driver Nikita Mazepin. Kevin Magnussen was drafted in to replace him, a deal that brought no financial largesse but returned a genuine talent to the team. He put the Haas in Q3 in qualifying for the first time since 2019 and followed it with a consummate drive to finish fifth in the race. Behind Mercedes, Haas were the strongest team in the midfield, while Aston Martin languished at the back and McLaren struggled to solve their brake-cooling problems. “You cannot write a story like this,” said team principal Guenther Steiner, impressively given his emotion, managing not to pepper his comments with his usually highly entertaining use of expletives. Red Bull didn’t quite have the pace of the Ferrari in race conditions but they were on it enough to challenge until what team principal Christian Horner described as the “nightmare” of both cars retiring with a fuel system problem. It appears likely the issue was to do with the high temperatures of the fuel as the final few litres moved around in the near empty tanks The temperatures are higher this season anyway because of the new part biofuel mix being employed and this can cause evaporation which damages the fuel pump, ultimately disabling it. Red Bull were the only team not to run a full race distance simulation in testing, when this issue would have manifested itself. They brought so many major upgrades to the car at the last minute their plans were compromised as they had to focus on making sure all the new parts worked. This was successful in that the car is very quick but at the cost of a potential failure that they did not see coming and that proved costly. In their favour having identified the issue if this is the case, a repeat is unlikely. Designed to improve the racing, in the cars ability to overtake and to follow one another on track, the biggest regulation change since the 1980s has a lot riding on it. One race was never going to be definitive, indeed a real picture will not emerge until F1 returns to Europe from the outlying circuits of the opening rounds. Yet drivers did generally concede that following was a little easier than it had been and certainly Leclerc and Verstappen diving across one another seemed to back that up but Bahrain has always lent itself to allowing overtaking. Of more concern at this stage is if the cars can mix it up, whether the tyres are fit to allow them to do so. The new Pirellis appear somewhat fragile, with a range of drivers concerned at how quickly they were degrading and how delicately they had to be treated on opening a stint to maintain their life. This too will become clearer as Bahrain is hard on rubber and on brakes but if the aero plans are working out they will only be successful if there is confidence in the rubber to back them up.",Sport/Sport,F1: five things we learned from the Bahrain Grand Prix,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/21/f1-bahrain-grand-prix-formula-one
3/21/2022,"A passenger plane carrying 132 people has crashed in southern China and sparked a mountainside fire, Chinese authorities have reported. The China Eastern Airlines flight, a Boeing 737, crashed near the city of Wuzhou in Teng County, Guangxi province. It had departed from Kunming at 1pm but did not reach its scheduled destination in Guangzhou. Flight tracking data shows the plane dropping from the radar signal to the south-west of Wuzhou shortly before 2.30pm local time. It also suggests the plane fell sharply, losing more than 8,800 metres of altitude in just a few minutes. The Civil Aviation Administration said it had activated emergency protocols and sent a working group to the scene. State broadcasters said rescuers had been dispatched but there were no immediate details of casualties. Onboard were 123 passengers and nine crew members. Footage circulating online and published by the official state media outlet, the People’s Daily, shows a plume of smoke coming from a mountainous region. Other clips show intense flames around a circular area, while another clip appears to show plane wreckage with the name “China Eastern Airline” visible. The Guardian has not independently verified the footage. The Wuzhou fire rescue department said it had dispatched 23 firetrucks and 117 personnel to the site. Another 538 personnel had been ordered in from surrounding detachments as reinforcements. Firefighters could not reach the site by road, and so had walked part of the way into the forested region, state media said. CCTV said the fire was contained within a few hours. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, called for a prompt investigation into the cause of the crash, the country’s first major fatal air disaster since 2010. The plane is a six-year-old Boeing 737-89P, according to flight data trackers. The Boeing 737-800s are among the most common passenger planes in the world, and different to the 737 Max, which was grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. State media reported China Eastern Airlines had grounded all 737-800 planes. China Eastern Airlines, a state-owned company and one of the biggest airlines in Asia, did not answer calls from the Guardian. Its homepage had switched to black and white, which state media said was to mark the crash. A spokesman for Boeing told the Guardian they were aware of initial media reports and were working to gather more information.

3/21/2022,"For his fourth birthday, I made my son an Incredible Hulk cake. His hope was for a 3D Hulk, an edible version of his favourite plastic toy. My plan was for a Hulk’s head impressive enough to make up for the fact that he didn’t have any limbs or muscles. Even this limited version proved too much of a challenge, however, and I ended up sticking a plastic model of the incredible one on to a round, green cake. After looking confused, Luca was surprisingly happy with his leaning Hulk, until a candle melted his plastic elbow. There was a birthday girl, too, so two sets of candles were lit, happy birthday sung in two languages and two cakes cut into slices. My green cake with foot marks remained pretty much intact, while the other disappeared square by square into small and large mouths alike. And with good reason: that second cake was what the other mum described as a torta versata con crema, which translates as a “poured cake”, but is best described as two light sponge cakes filled with custard. At first I thought the filling was added after baking, but as I ate my second tender slice, she explained that, after cooking one baked layer of sponge, the custard is spread over it and the rest of the batter poured on top, before the whole thing is baked again. Cake with a baked heart of custard – words as soothing as custard itself. Some of my happiest moments have been in the presence of thick custard or pastry cream; sitting in the old Patisserie Valerie with Dad watching his joy as he ate a custard slice, and breakfast of just-fried doughnuts filled with crema at the port bar in Palermo. The definition of pastry cream in Enciclopedia Treccani is soothing, too – la crema pasticciera (pastry cream) is made with egg yolks, sugar, milk, flour, maybe vanilla or lemon, thickened over heat and used to fill various pastries; the addition of chocolate or cocoa, or soluble coffee, produces crema al cioccolato or la crema al caffè. Soothing, unless, like American journalist and writer Ambrose Bierce, you think custard is “a detestable substance produced by a malevolent conspiracy of the hen, the cow and the cook”.While not malevolent, I have at times felt hostile towards custard – and afraid of all those yolks, which bring such a high possibility of something going wrong. This changed when I started adding flour or cornflour, which, I know, not everyone approves of (and means it is not actually custard). But cornflour is like bike stabilisers for a cook such as myself, reducing risk and ensuring thickness. A few green lemon leaves will give it a touch of the Hulk, although possibly not enough to win the approval of a four-year-old.

Whisk in 500ml milk, then set over a medium heat and cook, whisking, until the milk comes to a boil and the mixture is as dense as thick custard. Pour into a bowl and set aside to cool. Now make the sponge. Whisk the eggs and sugar for three minutes, then add 100ml milk, the melted butter (or oil), the flour, baking powder and the zest of the second lemon, and whisk again until light. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Butter and flour a roughly 30cm x 23cm cake tin. Divide the cake batter in two – either by eye or by weighing – pour half into the tin and use a spatula to spread it out evenly. Bake for 10-12 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to rest for five minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the lemon juice into the now cold custard and then, working carefully, spread it over the top of the cake. Zigzag the remaining cake batter over the top, smooth the surface then bake for 15 minutes. Remove and leave to cool, then invert carefully on to a plate.

3/21/2022,"Winner of the audience award at this year’s Glasgow film festival, Lizzie MacKenzie’s tender documentary debut about the simplicities of life far from so-called civilisation proves especially poignant in our hyper-connected time. Ken Smith, the “hermit of Treig”, has spent the past 40 years living alone in the wilderness, outside Kinlochleven in the Scottish Highlands. Such a lifestyle may be unusual, but Smith is far from an eccentric recluse; he is a gentle soul with a moving appreciation for his environment. Just as how he talks to his roses as they grow, Smith believes that when human beings care for Mother Nature, she will provide us with all that we need. The life of a hermit demands a lot of hard work. Smith fishes for food, forages for vegetables and chops his own wood; all of this is no small feat for a man who is now in his 70s. In the cabin that he built himself, there is no electricity – or indeed any sign of technology except for a small GPS device he can use to pick up weather reports. The gadget comes in handy when Smith suffers a stroke, and he can send a signal to emergency services. Suddenly, the film’s soundscape of babbling brooks and rustling trees is interrupted by the ominous sound of helicopter blades, as Smith is taken to the hospital. A dilemma springs from Smith’s health crisis: how much longer can he possibly live in this isolated condition? While the latter half of the film grapples with this conundrum, the thousands of photographs that Smith has taken over the years conjure up how much of his serendipity is tied up with his natural surroundings. Crisp in terms of running time, the film is elevated by the tender rapport between MacKenzie and Smith; when a film-maker is clearly captivated by their subject, the film can compel viewers to fall in love as well.

3/21/2022,"West Ham are unsure when Jarrod Bowen will return from a foot injury and are worried the winger could miss their Europa League quarter-final against Lyon next month. Bowen has not played since going off against Liverpool early this month and the club’s medical staff fear the injury is more serious than it appeared initially. Scans have indicated the 25-year-old has a fractured bone in his foot and West Ham, who host Lyon in the first leg on 7 April and travel to France for the return game a week later, are struggling to identify the cause of the problem. West Ham had been optimistic that Bowen, who has scored 12 goals and provided 11 assists in all competitions this season, would make a swift return. There were hopes he would make it back to face Sevilla last Thursday and the initial assumption was the former Hull forward had not suffered any significant damage. However, Bowen was absent again when West Ham lost 3-1 at Tottenham on Sunday, further denting their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League, and David Moyes does not know when the injury will clear up. West Ham will need others to step up in the absence of one of their most influential forwards. Michail Antonio has not scored in the Premier League since New Year’s Day and was criticised by Moyes after being taken off after 56 minutes against Spurs. Moyes also needs more from Nikola Vlasic. The Croatia playmaker has taken a while to adapt to English football since his £25.7m move from CSKA Moscow last summer and despite Bowen’s absence Vlasic was restricted to a six-minute cameo at Spurs.",Sport/Football,Jarrod Bowen injury persists and West Ham fear he will miss Lyon tie,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/21/jarrod-bowen-injury-west-ham-lyon
3/21/2022,"Spanish police have recovered dozens of exotic animals, including two caimans, three pythons, eight iguanas and 46 giant African snails, after discovering a private zoo on the Canary island of Gran Canaria. Officers from the Guardia Civil’s environmental division, Seprona, began investigating after hearing that a resident of the central town of San Bartolomé de Tirajana had died recently, possibly leaving behind a large and illegal menagerie. When officers visited the property, they found 139 animals, of which 118 were classed as invasive species, and 21 as dangerous animals. In a statement, the Guardia Civil said: “Among the species seized were a ball python, two Burmese pythons, a dwarf caiman, two bearded dragons, two Greek tortoises, 34 crayfish, a leopard gecko, 46 giant African snails, seven snakes, a bullfrog, a long-necked turtle, eight iguanas, a spectacled caiman, 23 red-eared terrapins, 13 blue-tongued skinks, and three African spurred tortoises.” Police also found 200 rats, 100 mice and “an indeterminate number” of cockroaches, worms and crickets. “One hundred and eighteen of the species recovered have great reproductive capacity and pose a serious problem to the ecosystem,” the statement said. “They can also pass on diseases that are dangerous for humans.” The confiscated animals were taken to Cocodrilo Park, a nearby exotic animal rescue centre. The force said that, according to Spanish law, exotic invasive species are defined as “those which are introduced or established into an ecosystem or natural or semi-natural habitat, and which are agents of change and a threat to native biological diversity whether through invasive behaviour or the risk of genetic contamination”.",News/World news,Pythons and caimans among animals found by Spanish police at illegal zoo,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/pythons-and-caimans-among-animals-found-by-spanish-police-at-zoo
3/21/2022,"Invisible microplastics have been found almost 400 metres underground in UK water streams, according to the results of a citizen science project conducted by wild swimmers. More than 100 outdoor swimmers in the UK became “waterloggers”, collecting water samples from their favourite place for a dip using empty glass wine bottles. This water was then tested, with microplastics present in every single sample. One of these samples was taken 400 metres underground in a cave in Northamptonshire. Rebecca Price, a caver who collected the samples deep underground, said, “The cave sample was taken from an underground waterfall which filters through natural rock. I’m shocked to find that nano- and microfibres were found that deep underground.” She also collected the samples with the highest number of microplastics, at 155 pieces a litre, in the River Nene, Northamptonshire, where she swims frequently. She added: “The Nene has had very bad reports about its water quality in recent years. These results focus on microplastics and highlight another toxic silent contaminant choking our beautiful river.” Laura Owen Sanderson, the founder of the non-profit We Swim Wild, which carried out the sampling, said: “We now know that microplastics are infiltrating every aspect of our lives. We breathe in, drink and eat plastic particles every day; and little research has been done to establish what risk that poses to human health. “This campaign provides a large and unique grassroots dataset for the UK government, as clear evidence that urgent action is needed now.” The group is calling for the government to test regularly for microplastics in UK rivers, and will soon launch another 12-month study into invisible contaminants in waterways. Recent research by Outdoor Swimmer Magazine found that wild swimmers are hugely concerned by pollution, and more than one-third of swimmers surveyed had written to their MPs and supported campaigns over the problem. Michelle Walker, the technical director at the Rivers Trust, told the magazine: “What really stands out to me is how swimming outdoors motivates people to take direct action on water pollution, and we’ve really seen the impact of that in the last year. Tens of thousands of people contacted their MPs to demand amendments to the environment bill, and as a result government were forced to change direction.”",News/Environment,Microplastics found deep underground in UK waters ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/21/microplastics-found-deep-underground-in-uk-waters
3/21/2022,"At a pivotal point in his career, Giles Terera realised that the parts being offered to him as an actor of colour were not necessarily the ones he was interested in playing. “They went up to a certain level but I had other stories I wanted to tell, other lives I wanted to investigate,” he says. So he began combining his acting roles – most famously as Aaron Burr in Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Hamilton, which earned him an Olivier award – with making music, films and writing. “I remember, in Hamilton, talking to Lin about that and he had the same thing: If the stories you want to tell aren’t being told, tell them yourself.” Terera is busy doing just that with his latest project: a play about a truly wretched moment in Britain’s slave-trading history which involved the killing of more than 130 enslaved Africans in 1781 on a ship called the Zong, owned by a Liverpool-based syndicate. The massacre occurred after the crew realised they were short of water; the company, having taken out insurance on the lives of the enslaved people, could make a claim when the ship returned home. Terera, 45, has not only written The Meaning of Zong, to be staged at the Bristol Old Vic, but is also starring in it and co-directing with Tom Morris. When we talk on Zoom, he is sipping tea at the end of a day of rehearsals. As the light leaks out of the room, he talks animatedly about the roots of the play. It was due to be staged before the pandemic and last year became a BBC audio drama starring Terera, Samuel West and Michael Balogun. Its inception came in 2014 when he overheard a snatch of conversation as he walked past the actor Anni Domingo. “It was an important moment in my life. As I passed her [at a gathering], I heard the words: ‘… the ship where they threw the Africans into the sea and the insurance …’ A bell went off. I asked her what she was talking about and I wanted to find out more. I felt it was shameful I didn’t know about this event.” He looked into the lives of anti-slavery campaigners Granville Sharp and Olaudah Equiano, read transcriptions of the court cases over the Zong and looked through archives at the National Maritime Museum. A detail from one document struck him: the record of a survivor who showed an extraordinary will to live. “A person who was thrown overboard managed to grab on to a rope and pull themselves back up on to the ship. When I read that I immediately thought ‘OK, this needs to be a piece of theatre.’ That’s where I started, with that character, because that was someone I wanted to see a play about.” Having written The Meaning of Zong, he began plugging away at theatres to stage it. “I’ve tried to take this story to different places, different theatres, and there hasn’t always been the appetite for it. That’s also what this play is about – three people, Sharp, Equiano and their shorthand secretary, Annie Greenwood, trying desperately to get their stories heard. They meet with massive resistance and I have felt some of that in trying to convince others [to stage the play]. We have a huge, huge issue with coming to terms with and acknowledging our past.” What bubbled up for him as he researched it? Anger? Sadness? Injustice? “All of the above, but also a massive joy at the strength of the people that I come from. From the moment someone’s captured, they are improvising, having to work out ‘How are we going to survive?’ ‘How are we going to protect each other?’ ‘How am I going to get back home?’ There’s an ingenuity there that staggered me at every moment.” The actions of Sharp, Equiano and Greenwood inspired him too. “I thought Christ, if these three people could have done what they did in the face of massive establishment opposition, what’s my version of that? What is happening in my society which I have to do something about? What you see in Zong is that the power of one person is massive.” What does he think of the concept of allyship on social media and of online activism? Is change something we enact in front of our laptops now? “Since the Arab spring, we’ve been led to believe in the power of what we can do just by being online. But when you look at the government trying to crack down on what it actually means to protest or use your voice, it becomes even more important that we don’t just tweet about it, that we are prepared to get up and do something.” Terera started out wanting to be a musician before enrolling at Mountview drama school to train as an actor. He wanted, initially, to work in films because he had absorbed his mother’s love of movies growing up. But “the parts that you tend to be up for in film don’t necessarily interest me either,” he says. Born in Hackney, east London, he was brought up in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. His Zimbabwean father died when Giles was four months old and his mother, a nurse who had come to Britain at the end of the Windrush generation in the 1960s, raised Terera and his sisters (including his twin) on her own. She died in 2007 and her death was a galvanising moment, when Terera realised: “You need to make the most of the time that you have. She made sacrifices. I knew what she had gone through so, for me, now, these are the stories I want to tell and I’m going to tell them.” Until the summer of 2016, he didn’t know anything about Hamilton. “I knew I was going to audition for it and my agent had said ‘Listen to this show [on the original cast recording]’. I hadn’t heard any of the hype – although at that point the Tony awards had happened, the cast had just been to the White House and they had filmed the show for what became the movie. When I listened to the CD, I immediately felt that Aaron Burr was a person whose story I had to tell.” Has his relationship to the show changed since the discussions on its lead characters’ associations with slavery? “As soon as I started researching Burr and that period, I was very aware of who these men were and their relationship to slavery. But what I loved about the musical was the casting choices about who was going to tell the story. It had an active sense, I felt, of reclaiming this period and this narrative. When I saw it on Broadway, the thing I was most moved by was that there were people who looked like me, up on stage, telling the story of men and women who are complex and complicated and layered. “By the time it got over here, it had become a pop culture phenomenon and I did wonder if it would have the same resonance. But then we’d go out to perform and when I’d see people of colour in the audience, I could see from their faces how much it meant to them to be looking at people who looked like them on stage.” The Meaning of Zong is at Bristol Old Vic, 2 April-7 May",Arts/Stage,‘It was shameful I didn’t know about it’: Hamilton’s Giles Terera on the Zong slave-ship massacre,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/21/giles-terera-the-meaning-of-zong-aaron-burr-hamilton
3/21/2022,"Over the past decade, students in England have been subjected to a barrage of reforms that have made their lives worse. It started in 2012, when the coalition government’s decision to allow universities to triple tuition fees to £9,000 a year came into effect. It continued with the scrapping of maintenance grants in 2016, and ministers’ failure to address student accommodation costs, which have rocketed by 60% since 2011. Now, in a long-awaited response to the 2019 Augar review of post-18 education, Boris Johnson’s government is proposing more changes that have flown under the radar – and we can’t let it get away with them. As part of the plans, announced by the universities minister, Michelle Donelan, on 24 February, it wants to introduce minimum entry requirements to stop students who don’t get a pass in English and maths GCSEs or 2 Es in A-levels from accessing student loans. It says social mobility is not achieved by pushing young people into university, but this completely misses the point. The proposals will hold back those who struggle with certain academic subjects, but whose talent will shine in a specialised area later on in their educational journey. How many graduates do we know who wouldn’t have been able to go to university because they didn’t meet these arbitrary targets? It won’t be young people on country estates who suffer the effects, but those from council estates. It is part of an ideological, regressive and immoral pack of measures, which amount to an attack on opportunity. The plan to cap student numbers for courses determined to be of “low quality” – which would limit the number of students able to take courses not deemed economically lucrative – is nothing more than a cover for clipping the wings of students’ dreams. That’s not all. Alongside a cost-of-living crisis, which former government ministers are telling us will create the most difficult economic year we’ve seen in a lifetime, the Tories want to burden students with an extra £54,000 of debt. From 2023, they want to reduce the salary threshold at which future graduates repay student loans to £25,000, and to extend the length of the student loan repayment term from 30 to 40 years. With inflation already over 5%, household energy bills expected to hit £4,000 by the end of 2022 and incomes facing their largest decline since the 1970s, it is beyond belief that they are trying to make higher education more expensive. Not only are they attacking current undergraduates who will be entering an increasingly costly world, but they are disincentivising education – a public good that serves all of society. When has forcing millions of young people into debt for the rest of their lives been a smart economic model? Students have been an afterthought throughout the pandemic, but this is a new low. Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, was right – students deserve better. You’d be forgiven for thinking that it can’t be that bad. They must have offered a sweetener to make things more manageable? Sadly not. For all the review’s flaws, Augar made clear that any higher education reforms must be introduced alongside reintroducing maintenance grants for poorer students. Not once did the government refer to this when it announced its plans last month. Radical change is needed, and thousands demanded it during the student strike. I’ve been so proud to be a part of rebuilding our movement during the almost two years that I’ve been the National Union of Students’ vice-president for higher education. As I prepare to hand over the reins to our next team of officers, it feels like the NUS has refound its proudly radical roots in its centenary year. There is still so much to fight against. We will continue to oppose this government’s ideological, regressive and immoral attacks against students. Recent announcements have made it clear that we need something completely different. We must allow ourselves the space to push for an alternative: a system that is fully funded and accessible for everyone. The student strike this month was the start of this journey, but it certainly won’t be the end.
