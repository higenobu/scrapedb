3/12/2022,"Can schools in England be said to be recovering – or starting to recover – from the impact of the pandemic? Disruption and absence due to Covid have reduced, and plans for this summer’s exams are in place, with some requirements reduced to take account of missed lessons. But the current attendance rate of about 90% at secondary schools is below the 95% which has long been Ofsted’s benchmark. There is no formal record of the number of children being home-schooled in England. Last week the country’s children’s commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, called for improved data. Ministers have announced plans for a compulsory register of those being taught at home, but not when this would be set up. Without school lessons, children will suffer by missing out on the curriculum to which they are entitled. The pandemic has taken a toll on mental as well as physical health, and there are concerns that schools are not equipped to provide the support that pupils are seeking. It is less than a year since the Covid recovery commissioner chosen by ministers, Sir Kevan Collins, resigned after the Treasury’s refusal to fund the £15bn schools catch-up package that he recommended. Following the much smaller increases agreed by Rishi Sunak, per-pupil spending has returned to roughly the pre-austerity level of 2009-10. Budgets for post-16 colleges are still 10% lower than they were under Labour. Earlier this month, MPs on the public accounts committee said children’s education was being eroded by financial pressures, triggering staff cuts and scaled-back curriculums, with local authority-run secondary schools among the worst hit. Young people deserve better. The government’s handling of the pandemic’s impact on schools has been error-strewn as well as ungenerous. The knighthood handed to the former education secretary Gavin Williamson was patently absurd given his appalling record. Ministers’ choice of a multinational Dutch company Randstad to deliver a £1.5bn national tutoring programme has proved a poor one. So far the business has reached just 15% of the pupils it was supposed to help, and MPs said last week that the contract should be ended if the company doesn’t “shape up” quickly. Schools are the organisations best placed to support children’s learning. Of course, oversight is important. But it is the Department for Education, rather than schools, that appears in need of challenge. Its altered national funding formula has exacerbated inequalities. Between 2017-18 and 2020-21, per-pupil funding fell by 1.2% in real terms in the 20% most deprived schools. In the least deprived 20%, it rose by 2.9%. While some academies have accumulated large reserves, MPs found, in 26 local authority areas more than 20% of schools are in deficit. Prof Lee Elliot Major of the University of Exeter has described the chaos surrounding the tutoring programme as “a battle for the futures of a whole generation”. The Education Policy Institute has pointed to stark regional differences in the long-term impact of Covid upon life-chances. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, has been in post for six months. He has yet to set out the government’s strategy for mitigating the harm caused by two years of disrupted learning, and for avoiding a Conservative legacy of widening educational inequalities.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on schools: it is ministers who require improvement | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/11/the-guardian-view-on-schools-it-is-ministers-who-require-improvement
3/12/2022,"EU leaders have announced their intention to collectively rearm and become autonomous in food, energy and military hardware in a Versailles declaration that described Russia’s war as “a tectonic shift in European history”. At a summit in the former royal palace, the 27 heads of state and government said on Friday that the invasion of Ukraine had shown the urgent need for the EU to take responsibility for its own security and to rid itself of dependencies on others. Speaking at a press conference in the palace’s Galerie des Batailles, in which France’s military achievements are celebrated in painting and sculpture, France’s Emmanuel Macron said the Versailles treaty of 1919 had divided Europe but that today leaders were uniting. He described Russia’s aggression as a “tragic turning point”. “We can see how our food, our energy, our defence are all issues of sovereignty,” he said. “We want to be open to the world but we want to choose our partners and not depend on anybody.” He added: “The Versailles declaration is linked to the fact that sovereignty in Europe, which might have been thought of by some as a slogan or a French fantasy, is seen by all today as crucial.” Macron defended the decision not to offer fast-track EU membership for Ukraine, which was criticised overnight by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “The answer is no,” Macron said of the request from the war-stricken country, but he added that the EU was mobilising all its economic power to help the Ukrainian government and that the “European path” was open. Lithuania’s president, Gitanas Nausėda, said there was a “flavour of disappointment” to the decision for a number of EU member states but that the bloc would return to the issue. The Versailles declaration was said to be the “initiation” of European defence by Charles Michel, the European Council president. The leaders agreed to “invest more and better in defence capabilities and innovative technologies” by substantially increasing defence expenditures and through tighter cooperation and coordination of their armed forces and procurement. While EU member states spend more than three times the Russian defence budget, there are limited tie-ups and multiple overlaps in capabilities. The European Commission has been given a new role to find weaknesses in Europe’s defences and to advise on investment. Macron said Olaf Scholz’s decision to set aside €100bn (£84bn) for defence and Denmark’s decision to put its opt-out on EU security mechanisms to a referendum showed the seriousness of the moment. The EU is also doubling its funding of military equipment destined for Ukraine to €1bn. “About 10 days ago, Germany decided to make historical investments and Denmark made a historic choice deciding to ask the people if they want to come back to the European defence and security project,” Macron said. “Everywhere you look historic choices are being made.” A deadline of 2027 has been set for freeing the EU from dependency on Russian gas, oil and coal. In 2021, the EU imported 155bn cubic metres of natural gas from Russia, accounting for about 45% of its gas imports and close to 40% of the bloc’s total gas consumption. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said the commission would produce proposals by mid-May on how to achieve the target. In order to prepare for next winter, plans will also be made to coordinate European countries’ fragmented network of gas stocks. Von der Leyen said in future underground stocks would have to be filled to at least 90% by the start of October each year. Macron and Scholz are due to speak to Vladimir Putin in what the French president said would be a “demanding dialogue”, with the EU threatening tougher economic sanctions should Russia’s president make a move against Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. Shortly after leaders left Versailles, a new round of measures was announced by the G7, with Von der Leyen citing the failure to respect agreements over humanitarian corridors as being a motivating factor. Russia is being denied most-favoured-nation status for its markets under World Trade Organization rules, which will mean tariffs being imposed on its goods, and Moscow risks having its representatives thrown out of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. After some resistance from Italy, the EU is also banning exports of any luxury goods to Russia, “as a direct blow to the Russian elite”, Von der Leyen said. “Those who sustain Putin’s war machine should no longer be able to enjoy their lavish lifestyle while bombs fall on innocent people in Ukraine,” she added.The EU will no longer import iron and steel goods from the Russian Federation and there will be a ban on European investments across Russia’s energy sector.",News/World news,EU leaders announce intention to collectively rearm in face of Putin threat,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/eu-leaders-announce-intention-collectively-rearm-putin-threat-russia-ukraine
3/12/2022,"Uber fares across the UK are set to rise sharply from Monday night when VAT of 20% will be applied to rides booked via the app. The change comes after a high court ruling last December that Uber could not be viewed as simply an agent but should be regarded as the contractor. Uber said fares would have to rise. The additional VAT will be charged within the fare and not displayed to the passenger. It is understood that Uber may effectively subsidise some fares, as a spokesperson said fare rises would vary from city to city, but refused to divulge further details on pricing on the grounds it was competitively sensitive. App users have been notified on a change in the terms and conditions which will mean passengers contract directly with Uber, rather than the driver, from 11.59pm on Monday. While the original ruling only applied to Uber’s business model in London, its biggest market, a spokesman said it was applying the changes nationwide in anticipation of further legal changes. Other operators will be legally required to follow suit in London, although they have yet to confirm plans. An Uber spokesperson said: “We have completed the changes to our business model as required by law. Other operators in London are also required to make changes to their models to comply with the relevant law. “Uber operates in an intensely competitive market and we are committed to always offering consumers affordable prices. As always, riders will get a trip price before booking their journey.” The changes came after judges initially queried Uber’s status during a court case where the multinational was fighting a judgment that drivers were workers with rights. The rise in fares comes after Uber hiked prices in the capital by 10% last November to attract more drivers. It will also hit Londoners’ pockets weeks after a nearly 5% fare rise on public transport in the city.",News/Technology,Uber fares to rise by 20% across UK as VAT is applied ,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/11/uber-fares-to-rise-by-20-across-uk-as-vat-is-applied
3/12/2022,"The national tutoring programme is to be overhauled after criticism of the catchup scheme for schools in England, with the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, promising further changes, including shifting funding towards headteachers. Zahawi said he was transferring £65m away from the NTP, including from Randstad, the Dutch service provider, to schools, in an address at the annual conference of the Association of School and College leaders. New figures from the Department for Education (DfE) showed that schools undertook the vast majority of catchup tuition under the government’s programme to help pupils recover learning opportunities lost during the pandemic. “I know that many of you have had challenges with the programme. I have listened and I have heard and we are making improvements as I speak to you today,” Zahawi said. “That includes the immediate transfer of up to £65m into school-led tutoring from the other two routes. It’s become clear to me that by far the most popular route is the one run by the schools.” Geoff Barton, ASCL general secretary, said: “It has taken far too long for the government to recognise this fact but it has got there in the end. The £65m extra funding announced today will help schools roll out the support that so many children and young people need to recover after two years of learning blighted by the pandemic.” Zahawi said it was “incredible” that 1 million tutoring courses had began since the NTP was launched in autumn 2020. The figures from the DfE showed that since September 2021 schools had started 532,000 tutoring courses, while the external tutor-led programme administered by Randstad had provided just 114,000. A further 74,000 courses had been started by school-based academic mentors funded by the government. The DfE claimed the NTP was still “on track” to meet its target of 2 million courses by the end of the year. The parts of the tutoring programme administered by Randstad have been heavily criticised for failing to meet targets in enrolling disadvantaged students, thought most likely to have lost out on learning during the pandemic. MPs on the education select committee on Friday said children in England faced “an epidemic of educational inequality” over the scheme’s failures, and said Randstad should have its DfE contract terminated unless it improved. The DfE announced further changes to the NTP, including allowing tutors recruited by Randstad to teach up to six children instead of a maximum of three in a group. The DfE also dropped a requirement that academic mentors hired under the scheme needed to be graduates, and now they need only to have A-levels. Randstad has been approached for comment. In response to the criticism by MPs on the education select committee, it said: “We have been working in partnership with the Department for Education, schools and tuition partners to look at how we can improve the programme moving forward to best serve the needs of schools.” Zahawi’s speech included insights in the white paper on schools that the government is to publish in the coming weeks. He said he wanted all schools in England to become academies and join multi-academy trusts: “I see the future as involving all schools being part of a strong trust, and I will say more about this in my white paper. “What I will say now is that I underline the word ‘strong’, because we mustn’t sugarcoat this – some trusts are not high performing. The white paper will set out how I plan to deal with that challenge as well.”",News/Education,Zahawi to overhaul Covid catchup tutoring after criticism of provider,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/11/zahawi-to-overhaul-covid-catchup-tutoring-after-criticism-of-provider
3/12/2022,"One of the pregnant women pictured escaping the ruins of the Mariupol maternity ward bombed by Russia has given birth to a daughter. Mariana Vishegirskaya, wearing the same dotted pyjamas she was pictured in as she struggled down the stairs of the devastated hospital, was photographed on Friday by the Associated Press lying in a hospital bed holding her newborn daughter, Veronika. In another photo, she looks on from her bed as her husband, Yuri, holds their baby. In the images from Wednesday’s bombing, the Ukrainian beauty blogger Vishegirskaya was visibly injured, with blood on her face, but she was targeted by a Russia disinformation campaign accusing her of faking the injuries. The Russian embassy in London claimed in a series of tweets on Thursday that Vishegirskaya had been employed as an actor to stage the photos, including a photo of a completely different woman being stretchered out of the hospital. The embassy plastered a red “fake” stamp across the two pictures as it justified the strike, claiming the maternity hospital had long been defunct and was being used by the rightwing Azov battalion. The tweets were taken down for violating Twitter rules. Three people were reportedly killed and 17 injured in the bombing of the children’s hospital and maternity ward, including a child, prompting outrage from Ukrainians and the world. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in an address posted to Telegram that the bombing was the “ultimate evidence” of genocide. “A children’s hospital, a maternity ward. How did they threaten the Russian Federation? What is this country, the Russian Federation, that is afraid of hospitals, maternity wards and is destroying them?” said Zelenskiy. “Hospitals and schools are destroyed. Churches and ordinary buildings are destroyed. People are killed. Children are killed. The aerial bombing of a children’s hospital is the ultimate evidence that genocide of Ukrainians is happening.” The UN confirmed that the hospital was clearly identifiable and operational when it was hit on Wednesday, contradicting Russian claims.",News/World news,Ukraine woman who escaped Mariupol maternity ward gives birth,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/ukraine-woman-who-escaped-mariupol-maternity-ward-gives-birth
3/12/2022,"Liverpool’s contract talks with Mohamed Salah have broken down and the forward will not sign a new deal unless offered improved terms. Salah’s preference remains to stay at Anfield but he and his agent, Ramy Abbas Issa, have dismissed the club’s most recent offer and no talks have been held since December. On Friday Abbas posted seven laughing emojis on Twitter in apparent response to comments by Jürgen Klopp in a press conference. The manager had said: “I think Mo definitely expects this club to be ambitious and we are. It’s Mo’s decision. The club did what it can do. It is all fine. All fine from my point of view. Nothing has happened further, no signing, no rejection, we just have to wait. Completely fine, no rush.” Liverpool regard December’s offer as a good proposal but Salah does not believe it matches his worth. His contract runs to 2023, meaning that if no resolution is found soon Liverpool will face a choice between cashing in on him or keeping him in the hope of striking a deal while running the risk of losing him on a free. Salah is happy at Liverpool and under Klopp and said in January he was “not asking for crazy stuff”. He said he was looking for a show of appreciation for what he has done and spelled out: “It’s in their hands. They know what I want.” The Egypt international, who will be 30 in June, would be happy to continue in the Premier League if he ends up leaving Liverpool.",Sport/Football,Liverpool contract talks with Mohamed Salah stall over wages,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/liverpool-contract-talks-with-mohamed-salah-stall-over-wages
3/12/2022,"Not so long ago the criticism of this England side was that they could not get out of their patterns and play on instinct. All too often we saw boot being put to ball when there was an overlap, it was prescriptive and if it was on the whole effective it caused little in the way of excitement. More recently I have seen encouraging signs but I don’t agree when I hear Eddie Jones say that England are just one pass or one kick away from clicking in attack. I hope that behind the scenes his messaging to his players is different because I see a side operating in attack at no more than 60-70% of their potential. By comparison, before Friday night’s match against Wales, France had scored 103 points and 13 tries, 10 of which have come after a maximum of two phases and all of them in fewer than five. That’s what progress looks like and this is a French side that is going to get better. If you want to see clinical attacking rugby, there it is – they expend maximum energy over a short period of time and get the most out of it. France are setting the standards of what modern-day attack looks like and put in that context, England are a fair distance away at the moment. When you’re not quite executing on the edges it tends to be for two reasons. Either you’ve been paralysed by analysis and you cannot adapt when the things that you see in training on a Tuesday are not the same pictures that present themselves on a Saturday. Or it comes down to poor decision-making. The challenge for England, as they look for the cohesion that Jones talks about, is that they are coming up against a side who are incredibly structured but at the same time very fluent in that structure. They’re up against an Ireland team who have only conceded three tries all Six Nations and they have the best defence in the competition, so pattern play and phase play will wear them out, but to beat Ireland they need to have an instinctive X-factor. They’ve averaged one try a game, discounting the Italy win, and that’s not good enough. Having said that, it is important to remember that the way we measure attack needs to be more than just tries. Wales outscored England three tries to one but England’s attack did function, they created penalty opportunities and Wales got punished, 3, 6, 9 before you knew it. But we would love to see more tries and with the quality they have we expect to score tries. On Saturday, Henry Slade plays a key part in that. Jones has named three different centre partners for him so far in this competition and the chopping and changing doesn’t help but he came of age against South Africa and is producing on a consistent basis now. I remember playing for the Barbarians against him in an England XV before he had made his full debut back in 2015. There were a lot of points scored that day – most of them by England – but my main takeaway from that match was how tough Slade was. He’s a good-looking guy, he never looks flustered, has beautiful hands, a booming left boot but it is easy to overlook his defensive qualities. I remember we ran a play to release Joe Rokocoko but Slade stopped him dead in his tracks. It’s a vivid memory that has stayed with me. With Slade and Joe Marchant in midfield you have two similar players, or rather players who see the game in a similar way and when you have Harry Randall and Marcus Smith as the half-backs, the common denominator among those four is that they are all instinct players. I hope to see them play with no fear, play on instinct and play what is in front of them rather than in patterns, or holding on to the ball for the sake of it. If they can do that then England have a chance on Saturday. I talked about the Wales match being a quarter-final and as such this is a semi-final. It would be wholly unacceptable if England were to lose to Ireland and then to France next week. If that happens we’re right back where we were a year ago. Back then they managed two victories against Italy and France. If they finish this competition only with victories over Italy and Wales then that cannot be considered progress. On the flip side, and looking at England’s predicament with the glass half full, they have a massive opportunity to change the narrative and to show they have clarity when the suspicion is there is confusion around what they are trying to achieve. Of course their focus has to be entirely on Ireland but they must also realise that they just need to stay in the hunt and make sure that they go to Paris with something tangible to play for. It is never easy when you lose your first match of the tournament but that’s the mindset they have to have, to just get through this week and while they want to be single-minded about a game at a time, they should approach it just as they did at the 2019 World Cup when they beat New Zealand to have a shot at the final. This team needs to have that siege mentality.",Sport/Sport,England must play more on instinct to become Six Nations best | Ugo Monye,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/11/england-must-play-more-on-instinct-to-become-six-nations-best-rugby-union
3/12/2022,"The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, has acknowledged that the potentially gamechanging design of Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes is within the Formula One regulations. Horner had been reported on Thursday saying he believed the design was illegal, but 24 hours later he insisted he made no such comment and that the Mercedes does indeed comply with the new rules introduced for the coming season. With the second and final test of the season under way in Bahrain before the opening race there on 20 March, Germany’s Auto Motor und Sport quoted Horner saying Mercedes had gone too far. “That doesn’t correspond to the spirit of the regulations. For us, these wings are illegal,” he supposedly said. Red Bull denied he made the remarks and Horner clarified his position. “To answer the question, whether we think it’s legal or not? Yes, absolutely. It looks like it ticks all the boxes,” said Horner. “Comments have been quoted that certainly weren’t made. The car is obviously innovative. It is an interesting solution, as far as we are concerned. The Mercedes car looks like it complies with the regulations. It’s just a different interpretation, a different solution.” The controversy, which may yet roll on into the opening part of the season, centres on Mercedes’ radical design of its sidepods. They have exposed the side impact structure – a strengthened fin and, in so doing, drastically reduce the size of the sidepods beneath it – potentially improving airflow, downforce and top speed. Mercedes are the only team to have taken this approach and, if it proves successful, they may enjoy a definitive advantage over the rest of the field from the off. Horner also conceded that the suggestion the approach went against the spirit of the regulations was not a valid objection. “There’s not really anything that defines the spirit of the regulation; it either complies or it doesn’t,” he said. “That’s not really for us to judge. The FIA have access to all of the drawings. A design like that would have surely been submitted in advance. It’s an interesting concept, it’s a radical concept. So, is it quick or not? Only time will tell, but in terms of its compliance, that’s very much an FIA matter.” Toto Wolff, Mercedes’ team principal, has been clear that the design was cleared by the FIA but admitted he expected there to be questions over its legality. The regulations are an attempt to change the aerodynamic profile of cars to enable more overtaking by reducing the turbulent air in their wake. A protest against the Mercedes concept could still be launched by other teams and it could yet be banned if eight of the 10 teams believe it is against the spirit of the new regulations. The FIA may be called on to take another look at the design, which has still to prove it confers a real advantage. Mercedes have not pushed the car anywhere close to a low-fuel qualifying run in the second test and may not do so until qualifying for the race in Bahrain next week. While Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, the reigning world champion, still declines to take part in the F1 documentary Drive To Survive, citing his belief that the footage is exaggerated to give the impression of friction and discord where there is often none, Horner also reacted to the controversy generated from the release of the new season of the Netflix series. In the show, he is featured making pointed comments towards Wolff, Mercedes and Hamilton. While Hamilton is celebrating his seventh title at the close of the 2020 season, Horner is shown saying: “I wish he’d shut the fuck up. How many times do we have to watch this shit?”. Horner argued that the series had chosen to focus on the antagonism for dramatic effect. “Last year was hugely intense and Drive To Survive at the end of the day is a television show,” he said. “So they are taking snippets from a season-long battle and using that in a television programme. The effect has been a dramatic uptake in the following of F1, but one has to remember it is designed ultimately to entertain. Elements are taken from it sometimes that are not even from the race in question.” On the penultimate day of testing, Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz headed the timesheets in front of Verstappen. Hamilton was in fourth, with his Mercedes teammate George Russell in 13th.",Sport/Sport,Red Bull principal Christian Horner denies saying Mercedes F1 car illegal,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/11/red-bull-principal-christian-horner-denies-saying-mercedes-f1-car
3/12/2022,"When he says that Britain and Russia are much more alike than either would care to admit, Martin Kettle makes a telling point: both were great imperial powers and both have struggled to adapt to their relative decline (Rupture is not an option: after this war, the west must learn how to live with Russia, 10 March). The European age of empire that first convulsed and then transformed the world in 1914 finally culminated in the horrors of the Third Reich and the Soviet Union, not least in the blood-drenched lands of Ukraine and Belarus. For Vladimir Putin, the revanchist wars in Chechnya, Georgia, the Crimean peninsula and Ukraine appear part of a desire to reverse-engineer a Russian empire, using brute force to recreate a mythological past that has come to obsess him. A different path is embodied in the EU, and it is one that Volodymyr Zelenskiy craves for Ukraine. In contrast to the dead end of empire, European integration promises a commonwealth of independent nations rooted in consent, democracy, shared values and mutual cooperation in return for a degree of pooled sovereignty. Britain, cheered on by such Putin admirers as Nigel Farage and Donald Trump, has chosen to reject this postimperial model (one that has brought peace, prosperity and stability to Europe) in favour of its own sepia-tinged, nostalgia-driven version of a distant global past. What an irony, then, that Boris Johnson now appears to support Ukraine’s bid for EU membership, having so enthusiastically pulled the UK out of the same organisation with the hardest of hard Brexits.John BaileyFarnborough, Hampshire  Martin Kettle looks back to the cold war to understand the present relations with Russia and the prospects for the future. Books can help, and he refers to an example by David Owen, but so could heritage sites and museums. It is a shame that the best-preserved remains from the cold war at the former RAF Upper Heyford base are being treated by the government as an exception to its much-vaunted policy of “retain and explain”, and is being culturally cleansed of its heritage value. What is probably the most important heritage site of the modern era and an instructional monument to the cold war is instead becoming a lesson in how little we care to learn about the defining event of the last hundred years.Daniel ScharfOxford Trust for Contemporary History  Martin Kettle says that Karl Marx argued that, from the early 18th century, Russia had become dedicated to “global conquest”. Catherine the Great’s conduct in office suggests Marx could have had a point. During her reign (1762-96) she partitioned Poland, extended Russia by 200,000 square miles and, after flirting with the Enlightenment, became a staunch defender of the aristocratic status quo once the French Revolution arrived.Bill JonesFormer professor of history and politics, Liverpool Hope University  Heartfelt thanks to Martin Kettle for being the voice of reason on the current situation with Russia. He is quite correct: Russia isn’t going to go away, rupture is not only impractical and dangerous but impossible, and the blustering, confrontational rhetoric that some are using at present (particularly within government) is helping no one, least of all the Ukrainians. In the long term, a form of calm coexistence will be vital – for everyone’s sake.Kate HopkinsLondon  Timothy Garton Ash’s suggestion that Ukraine should immediately be accepted as a candidate for membership of the EU (4 March) is not a viable solution and would surely inflame the current crisis. Such an offer would be impossible for Vladimir Putin, or indeed any future leader, to accept. The lessons of 300 years of history in the region, during which Russia has been the dominant power, cannot just be put on one side. The only way forward – not a new idea but a reasonable one – is that Ukraine’s right to exist as an independent and sovereign state should be guaranteed by treaty between Russia and the west, and that its status should be neutral – this also to be guaranteed by both sides. Such a proposal will not initially appeal to Putin, the western alliance including Nato, or indeed Ukraine itself, but it does at least offer a starting point for possible future negotiation, and it is hard to see a better alternative way out of the present dreadful and perilous situation.Richard GriffithsSyderstone, Norfolk  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Without a universal levy, if not an outright ban, on the manufacture and use of single-use plastics, little will change – the profits are too big. The global plastics industry makes billions and has done so for decades. Using the “polluter pays” principle, it is clear where responsibility for the clean-up is located. Unfortunately, as with many of our planetary problems, this treaty is an attempt to tackle the effects of lucrative bad practice without holding the polluters to account.

In the book Street Wisdom: Connecting with God in Everyday Life, the Benedictine monk and teacher Fr Albert Holtz tells the cautionary allegorical tale of how a discarded bottle on the ocean floor offers an irresistible temptation for a baby crab, which glides easily through the bottle’s mouth to discover an enclosed world that provides everything it needs: plenty of organic debris, shelter from strong currents and, above all, protection from its many predators. Delighted, it makes itself at home and begins to thrive.

As a bereavement volunteer listener, could I offer a further suggestion, to be undertaken before one finds oneself alone? Do not allow your whole source of company and socialising to depend on your partner. One of you will die first – a hard thing to face, but inevitable. Ensure that you have hobbies and interests that involve interacting with others outside of your relationship, now, while you are still together, and which you can sustain once you are alone. It is very hard to start up those activities when older and grieving, but if they are already in place it is much easier to continue with them and be supported by friends already securely made.

3/12/2022,"Your report (Surreal: art’s weirdest worldview bounces back a century after its birth, 7 March) quotes Thomas Bompard of Sotheby’s saying: “In today’s world – more and more complex, contradictory, multipolar – surrealism resonates more because it embraces all the contradictions instead of resolving them.” However, it is worth pointing out that surrealism is a contemporary, living and relevant movement of groups and individuals around the world, and really should not be consigned to being seen through the rear-view mirror. With surrealists in Leeds, London, Madrid, Paris, Stockholm, Canada, the US, Brazil, Portugal, the Netherlands, Egypt and, yes, here in Wales, our ludic activities are underpinned by the surrealist ideas of mad love, revolt, desire, anti-clericalism, the marvellous, the uncanny, freedom, objective chance, poetry, dreams, dérive, black humour and the unconscious, and constitute a much needed flash of lightning in these dark times. As we approach the centenary of André Breton’s First Manifesto of Surrealism, it is timely to be reminded that we surrealists remain “specialists in revolt” who continue to oppose so-called common sense, capitalist ideology, religious delusions and the miserabilism of everyday life, with total revolt and an unfettered imagination.John RichardsonClyro, Powys  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/12/2022,"The 48th staging of the Players Championship is destined to be better known for disruption than the identity of its champion. After torrential rain and approaching electric storms halted play at Sawgrass on Friday morning, the PGA Tour said a Monday finish had become almost inevitable. That the tournament, worth $20m in prize money, could run into Tuesday was not completely dismissed. “The potential is there,” said the event’s chief referee, Gary Young, of a Tuesday conclusion. “But let’s hope not. We feel very confident that we can finish this tournament by Monday. “We have received about 2.5 inches of rain in the last 24 hours. We battled through some pretty tough conditions this morning. The staff did a great job keeping up with the greens as much as we could, trying to manage play through some really difficult [storm] cells that we were facing. “Unfortunately, we have reached a point where there’s just no window behind this area that we’re moving into. There’s some lightning that is headed in this direction. “We knew it was just going to be a point where we’re just going to be battling too hard to keep up. The golf course has reached a point where it’s unplayable.” The situation is further complicated by gusting winds of up to 60mph in the forecast for Saturday. “We know that with the conditions we’re going to be facing [on Saturday], the pace of play is going to be slower as well,” said Young. The start of play was delayed by an hour on Thursday morning before a further four and a quarter hour stoppage. Incessant rain on Friday created huge puddles in greens and bunkers. Questions will undoubtedly be raised about the shifting of this competition back to March from its previous May slot, when it was staged between 2007 and 2018. Young added: “It is highly, highly unusual to have this [weather] pattern for this prolonged period at this time of the year, looking back at the historical data on it. It’s just bad luck.” Tommy Fleetwood, who opened with a 66 on Thursday, was afforded a blank day on Friday after an adjusted second round starting time became impossible due to the latest delay.

3/12/2022,"Mexico’s government has lashed out at the “corruption, lies and hypocrisy” of the European parliament after its members urged its populist president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to rein in his media-bashing rhetoric after the murders of at least six Mexican journalists. Mexico’s press corps has been plunged into mourning this year by a succession of killings targeting media workers in what was already one of the world’s most dangerous countries for journalists. On Thursday more than 600 MEPs overwhelmingly backed a resolution condemning the murders and voicing concern over López Obrador’s use of populist rhetoric “to denigrate and intimidate independent journalists, media owners and activists”. Such behaviour was contributing to “an atmosphere of relentless unrest towards independent journalists”, the MEPs claimed, calling for “concrete, prompt and effective” steps to halt violence against human rights defenders and journalists. The resolution appears to have infuriated López Obrador who – like his fellow regional populists Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro – is notorious for hectoring journalists and bristles at questioning from the press. In a peculiar and cantankerous declaration, the Mexican government hit back, telling the European parliament: “Do not forget that we are no longer anyone’s colony. Mexico is a free, independent, and sovereign country. “If we were in the situation you describe in your pamphlet, our president would not be supported by 66% of citizens,” added the statement, calling MEPs the “sheep” of the “reactionary coup-mongers” allegedly trying to derail López Obrador’s government. On Friday morning López Obrador, or Amlo as he is known, continued the offensive, blaming the “slanderous” European resolution on conservative politicians “with a colonialist mindset”. Mexico’s president, who said he had helped compose the pronouncement, also appeared to play down the recent killings of Mexican journalists, two of whom were shot dead outside their homes. “Regrettably, about 5,000 Mexicans have been murdered in the first two and a half months of this year – and of these 5,000, five were journalists,” the 68-year-old nationalist told his daily morning press conference. Amlo’s posture sparked bewilderment and anger. “Scandalous, demented, shameful,” tweeted Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico’s former ambassador to the US, comparing the government statement to the kind of invective usually associated with diplomats from authoritarian regimes in Venezuela, Nicaragua or Cuba. “What a pitiful statement,” wrote Denise Dresser, a political analyst and writer. “It belittles the government. It belittles the country.” Amlo has repeatedly targeted journalists during the first half of his six-year term. Where Trump and Brazil’s far-right president Bolsonaro rail against the “fake news” or “garbage” media, Mexico’s leader calls critics “sell-out” members of the “prensa fifí” (snot-nosed press). Last year Amlo began hosting a segment of his morning press briefing called “Quién es quién en las mentiras” (“The Who’s Who of Lies”), to expose supposed “fake news” journalists. However, in recent months Amlo has intensified his attacks in order, some suspect, to distract from awkward allegations that his son had lived in a luxury Houston mansion owned by a former employee at a US oil services company that had done tens of millions of dollars of business with Mexico’s state oil giant, Pemex. Amlo hit back, publicly revealing the alleged salary of Carlos Loret de Mola, one of the journalists behind the claims – private details many believe were illegally acquired from tax authorities. The Mexican president’s stance has drawn growing international criticism, with the Washington Post recently slamming Amlo’s “brazen attempt to discredit and intimidate” Loret de Mola and denouncing the recent killings. “The escalating violence is a stain on Mexico’s democratic record,” the newspaper’s editorial board said last month, urging the Biden administration to stand up for the free press. Asked about such criticism, Amlo laughed.",News/World news,Mexican president lashes out at EU ‘lies’ over his media-bashing rhetoric,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/mexico-lopez-obrador-european-parliament-journalists
3/12/2022,"Emmanuel Macron has condemned Boris Johnson’s government for making Ukrainian refugees unwelcome in Britain and for pretending to lead the world in helping the victims of the war. Speaking at the end of an EU summit in Versailles, the French president was eviscerating about Boris Johnson’s approach towards those fleeing Russia’s bombs. He said that by insisting that visa applications to the UK must be made in person in Brussels and Paris, the British government had imposed additional misery on desperate men, women and children. Macron accused the British government of failing to live up to its “grand statements”. “I would hope that the Ukrainian men and women who have lived through horror and crossed Europe to reach their families on UK territory will be better treated,” he said. The searing criticism of the British prime minister came as Russian airstrikes hit three more cities in Ukraine on Friday and tanks and artillery moved to what appeared to be firing positions to the north-west of the capital, Kyiv. Across the country, Ukrainian civilians are being shelled as they seek to flee besieged cities, in what is now the fasting-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war. In a Versailles declaration on Friday the EU said it would “offer temporary protection to all war refugees from Ukraine”, with the UK almost alone in Europe in insisting that even those with relatives in Britain must apply for visas. The home secretary, Priti Patel, had claimed until Thursday that stringent in-person security checks at application centres were also needed to stop Russian agents or terrorists smuggling themselves into the UK. Under heavy pressure from MPs across the Commons, Patel reversed her policy on Thursday, announcing that online applications could be made from next Tuesday. But Macron said more had to be done by the British government, with already more than 2 million people having fled Ukraine and millions more expected. He said: “I welcome the British shift, which shows there was a problem, despite what was being said at the time. I think nobody would have understood that despite all the grand statements we share that the British government continued to apply current rules that meant they did not welcome Ukrainian refugees who wanted to reach British soil saying they have to travel hundreds of kilometres in order to apply for a visa. “It’s a glimmer of pragmatism that they’re starting to align themselves with their own statements, which is a step in the right direction, although much remains to be done. I think the French home affairs minister’s letter was a helpful one. “Obviously we will do what we can and we are trying to cut back on the red tape so they can reach more dignified living conditions. I would like to thank the UK government for for this first step and we will over the coming day see whether it is enough or whether more effective measures are required.” The UK has so far only granted 957 visas out of at least 22,000 applications in progress. The policy of in-person applications caused chaos in Calais earlier this week as Patel had falsely claimed that a visa centre had been opened. Refugees who had travelled 1,400 miles (2,250km) to the Channel were welcomed by UK government posters informing them they needed to go to Paris or Brussels to make their applications. A minister later clarified that the application centre in Calais was in the process of being established, prompting calls for Patel’s resignation by the Tory MP Roger Gale for misleading the House of Commons. The UK’s Ukraine family scheme allows Ukrainian family members of British nationals to stay in Britain on successful completion of a visa application. Refugees who can find a private sponsor or local authority willing to provide housing and integration support can also come for an initial period of 12 months. In contrast, under the EU’s policy all Ukrainian refugees have the right to live and work in the bloc for at least a year and potentially up to three years. Ukrainian citizens already have 90-day visa free access to the EU. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, told reporters in Versailles: “Indeed we welcome this improvement for the Ukrainian refugees, this is a good step in the absolute right direction. “As you know we in the European Union already a week ago activated the temporary protection directive for the very first time in the history of the EU, which gives all Ukrainians immediate residency rights, access to the labour market, to schools, to medical care, to other support, so that these poor people can find a home and be accommodated in the European Union.”",News/World news,Macron says UK failing to live up to its ‘grand statements’ on Ukraine refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/macron-condemns-uk-grand-statements-ukraine-refugee-crisis
3/12/2022,"Farmers are calling for urgent government action to prevent soaring food prices and potential shortages in the UK as the war in Ukraine threatens grain and oilseed harvests, energy costs and the production of fertiliser. The National Farmers’ Union (NFU) has written to the government warning of “multiple compounding factors that have profound implications and risks for our food security” including further pressure on labour costs as Ukrainian workers have made up about 60% of workers taking up seasonal worker visas to pick and pack produce since the UK left the European Union. It has called for a review of the immigration system to help bring in 10,000 more seasonal workers and for urgent action to prioritise gas for food production and make it easier to use organic fertilisers and manure as an alternative to those produced using fossil fuels. Minette Batters, the president of the NFU, said the war had “focused attention on the importance and fragility of food security, both at home and abroad”. “There are some clear short and long-term actions that government can take to maintain confidence and stability across the UK’s food producing businesses,” she said. “We have shared these with government and we want to stress that we stand ready to take these forward together, in order to navigate the extreme volatility we see today and expect to grow in the coming months.” While the UK does not import much wheat directly from Ukraine, the country plays a significant part in European food production and the war there has forced up prices across the board. The country also accounts for about 45% of rapeseed which is imported to the UK and used to make cooking oil, more than a fifth of maize imports, which are used for animal feed and biofuels, while 80% of sunflower oil comes from the Black Sea region and has been interrupted by the war, according to analysts at the UK’s Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board. The NFU’s call for action comes as Yara, one of the world’s largest fertiliser producers, said it was now running at only half its normal capacity after shutting two plants in Italy and France this week because of the rising price of gas, a key input to the production process. Gas prices have risen amid the risk of a cutoff in supply from Russia, which produces about 40% of that used in Europe. Svein Tore Holsether, the chief executive of Yara, warned that further closures could be on the cards if gas prices continued to rise. As well as potentially affecting the production of fertiliser by the autumn, it could also hit supplies of CO2, a byproduct of the production process which is used in animal slaughter and food packaging. “Things are changing day by day. We have a lot of uncertainty at the moment and it is hard to predict going forward but there is a real risk that CO2 will be impacted as a result of this.” Meanwhile, pig farmers warned that the industry faced collapse as the soaring grain price only added to existing cost prices on feed and from labour shortages. “The situation is now beyond desperate and there is no light at the end of the tunnel,” said Rob Mutimer, chair of the National Pig Association. The group has written to retailers asking for an increase in payments to more than £2 per kilogram, more than 50% or about 70p more than is currently being paid. Without the extra payment the NPA said more farmers would quit the industry, which has suffered months of difficulties. “We are staring down the barrel of a total collapse of the British pig industry, which is not only a tragedy for the producers themselves, but will leave UK consumers short of one of their favourite and most versatile meats,” he said. The wheat price now stands in the region of £300 a tonne, compared with about £215 a tonne just a few days ago. Poultry and pork producers are likely to be the first to be affected by the rising grain price as bakeries and other producers using flour generally pay for their supplies well in advance. The next few weeks are critical for sowing wheat and other crops in Ukraine, where about 15% of the land is currently occupied by Russia according to the boss of MHP, one of the country’s biggest grain producers. Dr John Rich, the chair of MHP, told the BBC: “If this continues, of course our ability to sow rapidly diminishes, particularly if [the Russian army] moves into the west of the country where a large part of our operations are based.” He said this could lead to the complete failure of Ukraine to produce any grain. “The consequences are unimaginable as far as Ukraine is concerned,” he said. “For the wider world, it’s simple. The price of wheat will continue to rise, the price of corn and other commodities will rise significantly, and you’ll have spiralling inflation at a time when we’ve already had problems with the global supply chain because of Covid,” he added.",News/Environment,UK farmers call for urgent action to prevent soaring food prices ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/11/uk-farmers-call-for-urgent-action-to-prevent-soaring-food-prices
3/12/2022,"The Football Association is poised to unveil a historic close-to-tenfold increase in prize money for the Women’s FA Cup. In January the governing body said there would be “a significant increase” and the Guardian understands that the prize pot, currently about £309,000, will rise to well beyond £2.5m. It is not yet known what the distribution model will be. Prize money for the Women’s FA Cup has been in the spotlight in recent years, with the not-for-profit FA criticised over the fact that teams competing in the early rounds have struggled to cover the costs of taking part. The disparity between the women’s and men’s competitions has also been highlighted, with the 735 teams competing in the men’s FA Cup sharing £15.9m, while the £309,000 for the women’s edition – less than 2% of the men’s total – is shared by 300 teams. For women’s teams who win in the first-round proper £850 is on offer, whereas men’s teams at the same stage collect £22,629. Teams who win their fourth-round ties take away £2,000 compared with £90,000 for men’s teams at the same stage. The holders of the women’s trophy, Chelsea, picked up £25,000 for their triumph over Arsenal at Wembley in December – 1.4% of the £1.8m handed to men’s champions, Leicester City. As a result of the huge disparity, the Women’s Football Fan Collective was launched by frustrated fans from across the pyramid. It has organised the chanting of “No ifs, no buts, we want an equal FA Cup” at all Cup fixtures since the fourth-round games in early February. At the end of January the FA said: “Whilst the competition doesn’t yet drive commercial revenue to fund prize money growth, the FA Board has agreed a significant increase in prize money to support the competition’s continued development.” There have been similar discussions at international level. At the 2019 Women’s World Cup Fifa announced that the prize money for the 2023 edition would double from $30m to $60m. However this was widely criticised because the 2018 men’s World Cup prize fund of $400m is seeing a bigger than $30m increase for Qatar 2022, where the winners will collect $10m more than France’s $40m in 2018, with the runners-up taking $40m and third place $30m.",Sport/Football,Women’s FA Cup prize money to get historic close-to-tenfold increase,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/womens-fa-cup-prize-money-close-to-tenfold-increase
3/12/2022,"Ministers are expected to announce details on Monday about the second strand of UK efforts to take in refugees from Ukraine – people who do not already have family links, but will be sponsored either by individuals or organisations. This is what we know so far. The full details are still being organised between the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) and the Home Office, which are jointly in charge of the programme. But the basic outline is that individuals and families, as well as community groups, charities or businesses, can act as sponsors allowing Ukrainian refugees to come to the UK. The idea is that they would provide accommodation and support for an initial 12-month period. Similar schemes have been in place for some time, for example with Syrian refugees, and for asylum seekers from other countries. This is still being finalised, but the ambition would be to have some sort of online portal through which people or organisations could register their interest and then, if they are suitable, be matched with Ukrainians wanting to come to the UK. For the refugees, they would need to apply in a similar way to those already arriving on the scheme for people with family links, applying online while still overseas. This could be difficult and cause delays, given the significant difficulties experienced by many Ukrainians using the UK’s family links refugee scheme. This system is being jointly run by the Home Office and by Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, and Richard Harrington, the Tory former MP who this week was appointed as minister for refugees and given a peerage. From Tuesday, applicants to the family scheme who have passports can undergo biometric checks in the UK, meaning they do not need an in-person appointment before arriving, and the assumption is the sponsorship scheme will work in the same way. The initial sponsorship period is expected to be for 12 months, and the Ukrainians will be able to work in that period. One of the details still to be worked out is what happens then – for example if people will need a new sponsor to stay, or whether they will be granted leave to remain for, say, two or three more years. The response from officials is that because it is complicated. Potential sponsors need to be checked for suitability, especially if the refugees they take could include children. There is also a need to ensure relevant services are available, for example health services for older arrivals, and schooling for children. As one official puts it: “These things are complicated. There’s no getting around that.” The DLUHC is liaising with groups, including the Local Government Association, which represents councils, and charities that have worked on similar schemes. One complication is that a relatively high proportion of refugees could be children. While officials stress this can be hard to know – people expressing interest in theory, and then committing to house and assist someone for a year can be very different things – there does appear to be a willingness to help. One group, Reset, which helps to operate similar sponsorship schemes, says it has already received hundreds of inquiries. Other charities, which deal directly with matching refugees to homes under existing schemes, have had thousands of people get in touch. The DLUHC says there is “no limit on this scheme” and that the UK will welcome as many Ukrainians as want to come and can be found sponsors. Ministers have previously said that up to about 200,000 people could be expected to arrive in total under this scheme, and the existing one for Ukrainians with family ties to the UK.",News/World news,What is UK scheme to take Ukraine refugees without family ties?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/uk-scheme-take-ukraine-refugees-without-family-ties
