2/9/2022,"The average cost of renting a home in the UK is approaching £1,000 a month after demand drove prices up 8.3% in the final three months of last year, marking the fastest increase in more than a decade. Renters around the UK are now paying £62 more each month than before the pandemic, taking the average monthly rent to £969, according to property website Zoopla.  The average annual rent for people who are agreeing a new let is now £744 higher than it was in March 2020 before the pandemic. The rate of 8.3% in the final three months of 2021, compared with the same period a year earlier, is the steepest rise in 13 years. The increase will put further pressure on households, who are already feeling the squeeze from rising energy bills and wider price rises. Rising rents will also make life difficult for people who are trying to get on the property ladder at a time when the price of the average UK home reached a record high of £276,759 in January – £24,500 higher than a year earlier, according to recent figures from Halifax. Over the past year, rents have risen in every region of the UK, Zoopla found. The strongest growth – 10.3% – was in London, followed by Northern Ireland (10.2%) and Wales ( 9.8%). The increases were the lowest in Scotland, where they reached 4.8%, and north-east England where they rose by 6%. However, rents in the capital are only £18 a month higher than they were in March 2020, because they fell during the pandemic. Renters including office workers and students are now returning to the centres of the country’s largest cities including London, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and Edinburgh, after the “race for space” during the pandemic led many people look for a move to commuter areas. Demand for rental homes took off at new year, as the number of people searching for a property was 76% higher than during the same period between 2018 and 2021. Higher demand has not been matched by an increase in supply, and 39% fewer homes were available on the rental market in January compared with typical levels seen at the start of the year. The lack of available properties has pushed the cost of renting higher and created intense competition for rental homes, which are taking an average of 14 days to let, compared with three weeks in late 2020. “Rent hikes are fanning the flames of the cost of living crisis,” said Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at broker Hargreaves Lansdown. “Tenants have already been badly burned by rising prices, so higher rental costs risk sending their finely balanced budgets up in smoke.” She said the number of renters was growing, “partly as a result of lockdowns persuading more people in shared accommodation to look for a place of their own.” Meanwhile, landlords have seen tax changes put a squeeze on their income, so have considered selling their properties while prices remain high. Rent still accounts for 37% of a single earner’s pre-tax income, according to Zoopla, which is higher than the low of 34% seen during the pandemic, but only slightly above the 10-year average level of 36%.",News/Business,"Soaring UK demand for rented homes pushes cost to near £1,000",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/09/soaring-uk-demand-for-rented-homes-pushes-cost-to-near-1000
2/9/2022,"A statue of a Jewish woman whose success in business and connections with powerful people made her a renowned figure in 13th-century England will be unveiled by the Prince of Wales on Thursday. The story of Licoricia, who was murdered in her home 13 years before all Jews in England were expelled on the orders of Edward I, “shines a light on the nature of the medieval Jewish community”, said Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi.  The lifesize bronze of Licoricia with her son Asher is being installed on Jewry Street in Winchester, the ancient city where she spent much of her life. After being unveiled by Prince Charles, Mirvis will bless the statue. The ceremony is the culmination of a five-year campaign to raise funds for a monument intended “to act as an inspiration to women of today and also promote tolerance and understanding in our society”. It has been created by the sculptor Ian Rank-Broadley, who told the Hampshire Chronicle it was an honour to recognise “a woman who made a significant contribution to this country in terms of financial expertise and one who is probably forgotten by many people today”. On the plinth of the statue are words from Leviticus: “Love thy neighbour as thyself” – in English and Hebrew. Rabbi Jonathan Romain, who has researched the life of Licoricia, said: “The fact that the heir to the throne is unveiling the statue is a very strong signal that Britain is a home to all minorities.” A widow with four children, Licoricia had accumulated sufficient money and acumen to start a moneylending operation in Winchester in 1234. She was one of a number of Jewish businesswomen in the city and spoke several languages. At the time, there were restrictions on how Jews could make a living. Moneylending was one of the few occupations open to them as church law at the time forbade Christians to make loans. “On the one hand, it was a livelihood. On the other hand, it earned them an enormous unpopularity because everybody likes a moneylender when they need a loan but not when it comes to paying back. So it was a very toxic profession to go into, but unfortunately one of the only avenues open at that time,” said Romain. In 1242, Licoricia married David of Oxford, one of the richest Jews in England, after Henry III blocked efforts by David’s first wife, Muriel, to persuade a rabbinical court to nullify the couple’s divorce. Two years later, David died, leaving Licoricia with a fifth child and his successful moneylending business to add to her own. First she had to pay a huge windfall tax, much of which went towards building Westminster Abbey. In 1277 Licoricia and her Christian maid were found murdered in the home in Oxford she had shared with David, probably killed by a burglar. By then, Jews in England were subjected to violent discrimination and persecution, and in 1290 Edward I ordered they all be expelled. Jews did not return to England until the middle of the 17th century. Mirvis said: “In many ways, the story of Licoricia shines a light on the nature of the medieval Jewish community. Despite living in a society which was frequently hostile to Jews, Licoricia was totally committed to raising her family, building a successful enterprise and contributing to the prosperity of the country. “As such, the unveiling of this significant statue sends a powerful message to contemporary British society of the importance of industriousness, generosity and respect for all people.”",Arts/Art and design,Prince Charles to unveil statue of 13th-century Jewish businesswoman,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/09/prince-charles-unveil-statue-jewish-businesswoman-licoricia-winchester

2/9/2022,"Good morning. The French president completed a whirlwind diplomatic mission to Moscow and Kyiv on Tuesday and said he had received personal assurances from Vladimir Putin that Russia would not worsen the crisis over Ukraine.  Speaking after talks in Kyiv with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Emmanuel Macron said Putin had made clear during discussions on Monday that he would not escalate tensions. The standoff could take months to resolve, Macron added. However, Zelenskiyadmitted he was sceptical about his Russian counterpart’s apparent commitment to peace. “I do not really trust words. I believe every politician can be transparent by taking concrete steps,” Zelenskiy said at a joint press conference with Macron. “Openness was great” so long as it was “not a game”, Zelenskiy added. What else happened? Six Russian warships and a submarine passed through the Dardanelles strait on Tuesday, heading towards the Black Sea from the Mediterranean. The vessels – landing ships used for amphibious assault – began arriving in the Black Sea today. Why have Macron’s comments set alarm bells ringing? The French president seems to have stuck pretty faithfully to the script he had exhaustively agreed with his Nato partners. However, after the meeting he hinted at shifts in Nato’s outlook that some members say should never be made in response to military intimidation. Traffic has ground to a halt at the busiest border crossing in North America, as Canadian truckers and others angry with vaccine mandates spread their protest beyond Ottawa. Trucks started blocking Ambassador Bridge linking the cities of Detroit and Windsor late on Monday, closing down traffic in both directions. Yesterday, entry to Canada remained blocked while US-bound traffic slowed to a crawl. Each day, 8,000 trucks normally cross the bridge, which handles about 27% of trade between Canada and the US. Protesters also targeted another key border crossing in Coutts, Alberta. Canada’s capital city remained blockaded by hundreds of vehicles from the “freedom convoy” while protest organizers called for a meeting with all federal political leaders – except the prime minister, Justin Trudeau – to find a “peaceful resolution” to the crisis. What are the police doing to stop the blockade? Ottawa police said on Tuesday that 23 arrests had been made in relation to the “unlawful demonstrations”. The deputy police chief, Steve Bell, told reporters police had immobilized many of the heavy vehicles taking part in the blockade. Mitch McConnell criticized the Republican National Committee (RNC) for censuring the representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger over their work for the House select committee investigating the attack on 6 January on the Capitol, which he characterized as a “violent insurrection”. The Senate minority leader said it was not the party’s place to single out members over their views. Speaking to reporters outside Senate Republicans’ closed-door weekly lunch, McConnell rebuked the RNC for its characterization of the deadly riot at the Capitol as “legitimate political discourse”. “Let me give you my view of what happened on 6 January,” McConnell said. “It was a violent insurrection for the purpose of trying to prevent the peaceful transfer of power after a legitimately certified election, from one administration to the next.” Does McConnell still have confidence in the leadership of the RNC chair, Ronna McDaniel? He said he did, adding: “But the issue is whether or not the RNC should be sort of singling out members of our party who may have different views from the majority. That’s not the job of the RNC.” Hours after Mikaela Shiffrin’s attempt at a history-making medal haul in Beijing was left in tatters when the American star was disqualified from a second successive race, Petra Vlhová roared from behind to win the Olympic women’s slalom by 0.08sec yesterday. The US justice department has announced the unraveling of its biggest-ever cryptocurrency theft case, seizing a record-shattering $3.6bn in bitcoin in a saga that has captivated the internet. Ilya “Dutch” Lichtenstein, 34, and his wife, Heather Morgan, are accused of conspiring to launder $4.5bn in bitcoin. Claims that another Chinese tech worker has died after excessive overtime has reignited debate over the industry’s “996 culture”. The company denied that it overworked the employee but said it would pay more attention to the health of its staff. The University of California has agreed to pay $243.6m (£179m) to settle allegations that hundreds of women were sexually abused by a former UCLA gynecologist. The settlement covers about 50 cases involving 203 women who said they were assaulted by Dr James Heaps. Each will receive $1.2m. Nearly one in five applicants to the white supremacist group Patriot Front claimed to hold current or former ties to the US military, according to leaked documents published and reviewed by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the alternative media collective Unicorn Riot. Eighteen of the 87 applicants, or 21%, said they were currently or previously affiliated with the military. According to the SPLC, the Patriot Front “represents one of the most prominent white supremacist groups in the country”. If the early stages of the pandemic favored the New York renter – with bountiful apartments and incentives such as free months or waived amenity fees – that period has run its course as people continue to make their way back to the city. Between December 2020 and December 2021, the city’s median asking rent made its largest year-on-year gain since the pandemic began, from $2,500 to $2,800, according to data from StreetEasy. In December 2021, Manhattan’s median rent, with incentives factored in, reached a new record for the month at $3,392, reports the real estate company Douglas Elliman. Our seven-piece Guardian US series, The Rent Is Too Damn High, looks at how the Covid pandemic further strained one of the country’s toughest rental markets. We talk to striking low-income renters on edge now that the eviction moratorium has been lifted. We ask a broker to explain the tricks they pull on us. We investigate why co-ops, which make up 74% of Manhattan’s apartment stock, are able to operate with such power and impunity. Tipping points could be identified and triggered to deliver fast action to tackle the climate crisis, according to an analysis led by an academic at a British university. The study examines how small interventions, once triggered, can grow into systemic changes. Rather than focussing directly on cutting emissions, this approach leads to green choices becoming the most attractive. The scientists also said the approach could dispel feelings of helplessness about complex global challenges, stressing that big changes could start in small groups. A California nun will serve a year in prison for stealing $835,000 from an elementary school to support her gambling habit in an emotional case that left Los Angeles families and even the federal judge who handed down the sentence reeling.

2/9/2022,"Aline of large blue skips full of chopped wood sit at the back of a site belonging to Norway’s biggest bitcoin mining operation, a 5,000 sq metre warehouse on the outskirts of Hønefoss, a small town 40 miles west of Oslo. Hot air is being pumped into the 12 skips through bendy corrugated pipes curling out from the warehouse. Despite the snow, it will take a few days for the logs to be dried out, after which a local lumberjack, grateful for the free service, will take them away for sale.  The wood is being warmed by some of the so-called waste heat being emitted from thousands of stacked-high computer servers, known as miners, working away inside the warehouse. It is one of two such sites owned by the Norwegian company Kryptovault. The company expects its mining to account for just under 1% of the computing and process power in the global bitcoin network later this year. Bitcoin mining, the process of earning cryptocurrency by solving complex computational math puzzles and verifying transactions in the process, is famously energy-intensive. The latest calculation from Cambridge University’s bitcoin electricity consumption index suggests that as a result, the sector consumes more energy in a year than many countries, including Argentina, Pakistan and Poland. Heat is an inevitable waste byproduct. Despite noise from ventilation fans so loud that the company had to spend about £1.5m on insulation after complaints from neighbours, the hot areas in the Hønefoss warehouse can reach 55C. For many, at a time of rocketing energy prices, this may be further evidence of the unsustainability of a business that was recently described by Robert McCauley, a senior fellow at Boston University’s global development policy centre, as “worse than a Madoff-style Ponzi scheme”. The critics are certainly circling. Russia’s central bank has proposed outlawing all cryptocurrency operations in the country, and China has already done so. Swedish regulators have called for something similar in Europe. Norway’s regional development minister, Bjørn Arild Gram, told the Guardian his government was reviewing its options. “Although crypto-mining and its underlying technology might represent some possible benefits in the long run, it is difficult to justify the extensive use of renewable energy today,” Gram said. “The ministry of local government and regional development is currently reviewing potential policy measures in order to address the challenges related to extensive energy usage caused by crypto-mining.” But there is a fightback brewing in the sector, of which Kryptovault, which uses only renewable energy, is a part. This week, the billionaire Michael Novogratz, the owner of Galaxy Digital, a digital assets company that seeks to become “the Goldman Sachs of crypto”, launched a sustainability programme on energy use and social responsibility, saying the industry needed to tackle a “false narrative around it being bad for the environment”. It has been described by some critics as greenwashing, but within a world that has until now been less than transparent over its activities, preferring secrecy over sympathy, this was a shift. Kjetil Hove Pettersen, 39, Kryptovault’s chief executive, who founded the company with friends after deciding to turn a hobby into a business, said he also believed it was time for the sector to push back at the prevailing narrative. “If you look at the total energy cost, globally, for any given thing, it’s always going to be huge – I think we can always compare to that of a small European country,” he said. “That includes also traditional gold mining, which takes more than four times the amount of energy as bitcoin mining.” Advocates for bitcoin argue that it offers the opportunity to exchange value with someone instantly without using a third party such as a bank, without permission and virtually for free. They say it is being adopted at a faster rate than the internet in the 1990s, with El Salvador having become the first country to adopt it as legal tender, alongside the US dollar, in spite of misgivings from the International Monetary Fund. Pettersen said people wanted bitcoin, and mining operations provided economic returns through tax and employment. Mining is further said to offer a way for countries with excess renewable energy supply from hydro, wind or solar power at certain times and seasons to make value of it within their own borders and without transfer costs. Estimates of what proportion of the energy used in mining is renewable vary from 25% to 57%. “Mining is not polluting in itself,” said Pettersen. “If you are running coal to run mining then that’s another story, that’s what you don’t want. Mining should be done in more than places like Norway – and it can be a way to save trapped energy. For example, in northern Norway where there is excess, or in El Salvador where they are now using energy from volcanoes, setting up production when it wasn’t there before.” Kryptovault aims to have 15,000 miners at work by this autumn. Otto Him, 37 and Martin Mikalsen, 26, who manage the Hønefoss mine, have nicknamed one area between two huge walls, or pods, of 6,500 computers as “the cathedral”, in recognition of its awesome scale. The company is transitioning from older bitcoin miners to new ones shipped from China that are said to be three times more efficient. There will be plenty more waste heat to use. The company is in early talks to dry seaweed for a local firm. Pettersen says the narrative will change. “At some point, country after country will adopt bitcoin as legal tender and at some point it will be obvious that it is going to change the world,” he said. “Just as it became obvious that the internet was here to stay.” 1) Kazakhstan 2) Russia 3) Ireland* 4) Germany* 5) Sweden 6) Norway 7) Iceland 8) UK 9) France 10) Georgia *Evidence of activity probably inflated owing to redirected IP addresses via the use of VPN or proxy services.

2/9/2022,"Abattle is raging in front of our eyes, but this is no ordinary war. While the combat may be bloodless, no one should be fooled. This clash is fierce and unforgiving, representing the ideological struggle of our age. On one side we find men wearing animal horns and dressing in furs. On the other are legions of devotees draped over their computer screens. This contest of wills is the ultimate postmodern showdown. I’m talking, of course, about the fight for our future, namely, the legendary battle of far-right conspiracy theorists v K-pop. And the good news is that, in this war, K-pop – that globally renown, highly engineered, synthesiser sounding, toe-tapping, arm-snapping, bubblegum pop music – keeps winning.  The latest evidence landed a few days ago with a post on Reddit, where one Redditor wrote that her “liberal left-wing QAunt” had “descended down the rabbit hole of Qlore from cabals who eat kids to democrats/Hollywood celebs trafficking people to Epstein island.” Then, the poster explained, “it all just ... stopped. She stopped sharing Q stuff, stopped believing in it, started talking about liberal stuff again like it never happened. I was baffled. Did she have dementia? A stroke?” The answer, my friends, is right there, plain for everyone to see. Her aunt’s saviors? BTS, the seven-member megastar boyband from South Korea. “She started getting into K-pop as soon as Dynamite was released,” the redditor wrote, referencing BTS’s 2020 hit and their first song completely in English, “and dear lord, now she knows their names, their mom’s names, their favorite food, etc. From what she told me, they inspired her to be a better person. They would make donations to BLM, rally for accessible mental health for all and promote self-love and compassion. She is now an ARMY and I guess ... That’s that?” For the uninitiated, ARMY stands for Adorable Representative MC for Youth. (I cringed when I learned that, too.) Adorable aside, BTS’s ARMY is a formidable global force for good. As the post indicates, ARMY takes BTS’ message of “radical poptimism” and parlays it into global fundraising campaigns to “heal the world”. Made up of millions of young and admiring fans across the planet, ARMY has raised money for everything from helping rape survivors in South Africa to planting trees in Ecuador. Most donations are relatively small and, like the band, not overtly political, but when BTS took a stand against racial discrimination by donating one million dollars to Black Lives Matter in 2020 (which seemed only appropriate considering they draw so heavily on African American music), ARMY rallied its own fundraising campaign and matched the million dollar donation in a quick 25 hours. In other words, if you thought K-pop was all hair gel and dance moves, you’ve got another thing coming. K-pop fans are not to be underestimated, and they are inventing community everywhere they go. In the United States, at least, that community has an increasingly political bent. US K-pop fans are young and energetic, highly literate in all kinds of social media, and lean heavily toward socially progressive causes. This has translated into a kind of Covid-era activism from the home computer. In June 2020, K-pop fans in the US took over a white supremacist hashtag on Twitter, spamming the hashtag with either nonsense messages or anti-racist posts. When the Dallas police department asked people to send them videos of protestors that same month using an app called iWatch, K-pop fans quickly crashed the app by bombarding the system with content from their favorite K-pop stars. Also in 2020, K-pop fans, along with TikTok users, were credited by many with registering for thousands of tickets for Trump’s 19,000 seat-rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma and then deliberately staying home to ruin the event. Genius. And here I was thinking the appeal of the music was in the beat. K-pop activism is about more than melodies and personalities, and it moves in stark contrast to the social isolation that marks so much of our society, especially during our contemporary Covid era. K-pop activism is about belonging and the common good. As one 18-year-old BTS fan from California told Good Trouble magazine, “I wasn’t in a great place when I became ARMY. Having music that makes you feel a little less alone helped me a lot. The more I listened, the more their message resonated.” For that reason, maybe K-pop’s counterpoint to far-right extremism isn’t so hard to understand. Both movements may offer subcultures to belong to, but those subcultures couldn’t be more different from each other. Another K-pop fan, a 43-year-old man from Cincinnati, told Good Trouble magazine that the “opposite of the toxic brew of ugly Trumpist nationalism happening in the US” is something inherently positive. “BTS has created a virtuous cycle of infectious hopeful optimism that crosses every language, cultural, or age barrier.” This fan’s description of the BTS world seems like a far cry from the nether reaches of the dark web, where much of the far right exists. Understanding the difference seems important at this moment. Reputable research on extremism warns us that people join extremist groups not because of commitments to any particular faith or ideology or because of personality type. Rather, social isolation, economic insecurity, and extended loneliness are among the real vulnerabilities, and all kinds of radicalizations thrive when people fall into this state. As the Center for Analysis of the Radical Right puts it, social isolation “exacerbates already existing grievances, leaving individuals vulnerable to extremism”. It’s no wonder that wacko conspiracy theories have thrived under Covid lockdowns. This is not to argue that every lonely person is about to become a QAnon follower or a Proud Boy, but we should recognize that our isolated and atomized society – made all the more so because of Covid and, in some way, our technology – comes with risks attached. Hannah Arendt, the great twentieth century political philosopher of totalitarianism, understood this well. Arendt wrote about how “the masses grew out of the fragments of a highly atomized society” made worse by society’s “competitive structure and concomitant loneliness”. The result of this atomization helped to facilitate “an especially violent nationalism, to which mass leaders have yielded against their own instincts and purposes for purely demagogic reasons”. She wrote that shortly after the second world war, but it almost sounds as if she’s describing today’s Republican party. Okay. This is getting heavy. Can you hear the bass boom? I’m ready. What I mean to say is that while K-pop fans, like far rightists, may also be labeled as cultish and extreme, and while K-pop stars are sometimes extremely culturally insensitive, it may still just be possible enough to see K-pop activism as a deradicalizing movement. Just look at what K-pop activists are accomplishing compared to what the far right is doing. At the very least, the K-pop activists seek to embrace the world rather than to dominate it. As music, K-pop is most certainly fully formed consumerist kitsch. It’s a purely manufactured, post-industrial product pulsing and blinging at the heart of global capitalism. Yes. But, also, come on! It’s just so damn danceable! I’m pretty sure Emma Goldman would have invited BTS to play at her revolution. And had he been alive today, even an old anti-fascist curmudgeon and universal hater of pop music like Theodor Adorno probably would’ve secretly had his own favorite BTS band member. My guess? He would’ve chosen J-Hope. Makes sense. Always choose hope.

2/9/2022,"It was 26 May 2017 on the Portland MAX light rail service when a white supremacist named Jeremy Christian began threatening two teenage girls; one of the girls was black, the other in hijab. Three other men, all strangers on the same train, stood up to Christian, defending and ultimately saving the girls. Christian attacked the three men with a knife, killing 53-year-old Ricky John Best and 23-year-old Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche and injuring Micah David-Cole Fletcher. As Taliesin was bleeding, another passenger, a woman named Rachel Macy, knelt with him, comforting him and staunching his wounds. Taliesin knew he was dying. “Tell everyone on this train I love them”, he said to Macy in his final moments.  These beautiful words stopped me in my tracks when I first heard them. They gave me a directive, a way of being. At my best moments, this stranger’s last words guided where I looked, how I acted, and what I chose to do with my time. Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche’s mother describes her son’s last words as “the most important thing in the whole process”. Taliesin’s father says that when he heard what his son said, “It was literally a saving grace for me.” They were a saving grace for me, too: they changed my life. Loving everyone on the train meant I could love people I didn’t yet know. What Taliesin said felt instinctually correct to me yet was simultaneously baffling. It often seems there are impossibly huge chasms between me and others, so how could I love them? The heroism of the men on the train spurred many to react in all sorts of ways. A crowdfunding account called “Muslims Unite for Portland Heroes” raised more than $600,000. Many people, myself included, took Taliesin’s final message into their hearts. Strangers wrote songs and made videos and artworks about his actions and words. The public reaction to the men who saved the girls on the train, and Taliesin’s words, helped his family through the trauma of his death. I talked with his parents last month. “I think if there weren’t such a major up-swell of compassion and energy that came out of that, I would have had a lot harder time with the whole thing,” his father, Christopher DuPraw, said. “It was quite miraculous just how it expanded. That energy of ‘tell everyone on this train I love them’ completely shot around the world and on some level made it OK.” He laughed a little as he said that last part, still seeming to marvel at the fact. There is much to marvel at in the story of Taliesin’s life and his death. He was young, just 23, and according to his friends and family members he was a funny, energetic, compassionate person with a drive for adventure and a deep understanding of the need for social justice. Women adored him and vice versa; he loved to gamble; his friends stayed his friends for ever. Taliesin’s mother, Asha Deliverance, said, “He really fully believed that his life could help make change happen. And he had enough fire behind him to really believe that. He was not a lost soul at all; he was a soul with purpose.” The last time she saw Taliesin was on Mother’s Day, and she asked him why he didn’t drive to work, offering to pay for a parking garage so that he didn’t have to take the train. He told her he just preferred public transport. Asha wonders now if that was her mother’s intuition warning her to get him off the train. At the same time, she is confident that Taliesin was on a path, and was not to be diverted. He was intentional about the importance of love, and when he defended the girls against Islamophobia and racism on the train, he meant it. She knew he was living his beliefs when he was killed. “He chose to do that. That became very apparent within a few days, that this was a massive statement he was making. I never questioned or doubted his choices.” Christopher sees his son’s last words as having meaning that will carry into the future. “I feel like this is an ongoing saga. His message was a unifying message, but so much of what we are dealing with today is so divisive, from Trump to Covid, and it makes it so hard, just so difficult for people to get back to the unified consciousness.” He sounds sad, just for a moment, but I hear him brightening, and he adds, “But there is always that reminder somewhere if people look for it. And hopefully, they’ll keep looking for it.” I find that reminder in Taliesin’s words whenever I think of them.

It will contort reality, throw up flares and turn its face on decency – anything to save itself.So perhaps we should not be surprised that through shadowy channels, via sycophantic media, Boris Johnson has made known his intention to further feed his “war on woke” by scuppering a perfectly sensible suggestion “to counter unconscious bias and/or underlying racism” in parliament. Last Thursday afternoon, when the report was debated in the Commons, the only MP openly discussing his difficulty with the proposed “respect” principle was, predictably, Jacob Rees-Mogg, always a willing combatant in the war on woke. But through judicious leaks to encouraging and enabling media, we see the government’s direction of travel.The measure was suggested by the crossparty Commons standards select committee and would bring the mother of parliaments into line with the practices and expectations common in firms and institutions up and down the UK. Its adoption would send an important signal to those who have not already committed themselves to “anti-racism, inclusion and diversity” by showing leadership on the matter. But the beleaguered prime minister desperately needs to shore up his support, so instead he and his supporters promise a stand against “politically correct restrictions”, according to a Whitehall source in the Telegraph. They reject calls for more anti-racism, inclusion and diversity and clothe it as a principled move to protect “free speech”. There is of course form for this in the Conservative party: last year, when unconscious bias training was made available at the Commons – a voluntary scheme requested by MPs themselves – several Tory MPs refused to take part and one, Ben Bradley, denounced it as “Orwellian” and “totally nonsensical”.  It begs the question: in attempting to shore up his position, would the prime minister and his allies be happy to tolerate disrespect, intolerance and the furtherance of racism?It is also a misleading attempt at “virtue signalling” over free speech. The truth of the matter is that no single individual can unilaterally decide on Commons standards issues. They’re what’s known as “whole of the House” matters to be settled by 650 MPs, not prime ministerial decree. The “review of the code of conduct: proposals for consultation” is just that – nothing has been finalised, and the consultation closes on Thursday. The government hasn’t even responded yet. One wishes it would do so through the proper channels rather than anonymous briefings to distract from the real concerns people face in the shape of the pandemic and the cost of living crisis. MP are already expected to observe principles set out in the parliamentary behaviour code – of respect, professionalism, understanding others’ perspectives, courtesy, and acceptance of responsibility. If they believe they are already abide by those principles, why would they worry about the expectation being made more transparent and specific?The plan to undermine a decent attempt to make parliament an exemplar in terms of race and equality is yet another example of MPs setting themselves apart from the diverse communities they serve. This Johnson government, seeking any advantage in a time of crisis, cannot be expected to act in the best interests of the country, or even parliament. We MPs must rise to a higher responsibility.

2/9/2022,"When the coronavirus struck New York City in March 2020, an unprecedented number of tenants stopped paying rent. Many just couldn’t afford it. Others demanded better conditions in their buildings. And some saw it as a way to call for structural change. This informal movement, organized around a call to “cancel rent”, was buoyed by a nearly two-year eviction moratorium, enacted to protect New Yorkers from losing their homes during the pandemic.  But with the moratorium expiring last month, have New York’s tenants recovered, or are they at risk of losing their homes? We spoke to more than a dozen people across New York City who stopped paying rent or went on rent strike since the pandemic began. We wanted to listen to the city’s most precarious residents as they fought – and still fight – to hang on to the roofs over their heads. Most had applied for housing assistance during this time, but none had yet received aid. All described how they had gained a deeper appreciation for collective action, and all know their battles are far from over. Below are five of their stories. Rose Helesca was at a breaking point. Not just from her work as a nurse on the front lines of the pandemic – but from living with her three children in one of Brooklyn’s most neglected buildings, 1616 President Street. Even before the virus hit, the ceiling leaked, the walls were moldy, the heat hardly worked, and rats and roaches roamed free. She didn’t know whom she was angrier at: her landlord, Jason Korn, who ignored the residents’ complaints, or New York’s housing department (HPD), which seemed unable to hold him accountable despite him topping the list of the city’s “worst landlords” two years in a row. So when her neighbors decided to start a rent strike to demand changes, Helesca was all in: “We said, ‘Let’s hit his pocket.’” It was the city’s first organized rent strike under the pandemic, and it got Korn’s attention. He began calling tenants to negotiate, offering payment plans and individual fixes. But the tenants held firm in demanding top-to-bottom repairs. Then, in the summer, says Helesca, the landlord turned the heat up, forcing all the tenants outside. When they called Korn to complain, Helesca says he replied: “What’s the big deal? You’re not paying rent, so what are you complaining about?” In an email, Josh Rosenblum, a lawyer representing Korn, called the story about the heat “an absolute lie” and blamed the building’s outstanding violations on tenants refusing access to their apartments for repairs. In September 2021, Korn sold the building to a newly created holding company; Helesca says tenants have never met the new landlord, but they suspect Korn is behind the company, which Rosenblum also denied. The standoff is approaching two years with no resolution, but Helesca feels more determined than ever. They’ve inspired tenants of Korn’s other buildings, who have started rent strikes of their own. “The other buildings believe in us – they’re like, ‘1616 is so powerful.’” Helesca said she hoped more tenants would realize they can stand up to their landlords. “Don’t be afraid. Fight for what you think is right. As my mama says, there’s nothing to be scared of if you know you’re not wrong.” The first time the artist and activist Caitlin Baucom received an eviction note after they fell behind on rent for their Bushwick loft in 2019, it felt “terrifying,” they said, “like the floor was falling out from under you”. But it was a gift in disguise. As Baucom researched housing laws, they realized the note from their landlord, Richard Pogostin, was likely to be illegal – along with many other aspects of his management of the building. So when the pandemic hit the following year, they felt empowered to stop paying rent for good. “I was just like, ah, fuck it,” they said. “I don’t think they can legally proceed with an eviction because their half is also illegal.” That summer, after a gym vacated the storefront under their apartment, Baucom and other volunteers entered the space and transformed it into a mutual aid hub against their landlord’s wishes. For a while, the Gym, as the operation became known, distributed support kits to Black Lives Matter protesters, as well as meals and supplies to neighborhood residents and unhoused people – until Pogostin forced them out with the aid of police. Since then, the volunteers have continued to help their neighbors from the sidewalk. In a phone call, Pogostin called Baucom’s complaints about the building maintenance “ridiculous” and said he would continue efforts to evict them. He said Baucom’s mutual aid was “all about them not having money, needing a place to stay, and somehow turning it into a social issue”, and their sidewalk activities were “hurting business and scaring people”. It was people like Baucom, he said, who were driving New York’s rents up by forcing others to subsidize them. But Baucom argues that not paying rent does precisely the opposite, by refusing to feed the cycle of speculation that drives rents up in the first place. And people with more privilege should join in, they say. “In my opinion, the mutual aid thing and the rent strike thing and the active resistance of capitalism is all the same thing,” they said. “It shouldn’t be incumbent on people who can’t afford to pay rent right now to rent-strike. The point should be that everyone rent strikes or refuses to pay above a certain amount of rent so that then their neighbors can also have homes.” Virtually every dollar Shy Morris receives – from her disability checks, social security, and odd jobs – goes toward her apartment. That means nothing left over for food, and sometimes not even her phone bill. “I’m just afraid because I don’t want to be homeless,” she said. With the eviction moratorium over, she doesn’t want to take any chances. Morris’ one-bedroom co-op in Fort Greene was left to her by her grandmother, who owned the unit and passed away shortly before the pandemic. But the virus hit, Morris lost her job as a home attendant, and that’s when she stopped paying her apartment’s monthly maintenance fee – which “kept piling” until it had reached more than $8,000. A member of the co-op board approached Morris and threatened her with eviction: “You can’t just stay in this apartment. You’ve got to give something.” Now Morris pays the monthly maintenance but relies on a neighborhood mutual aid group to buy food and other necessities. “They really saved my life,” she said. “Food stamps are OK, but sometimes you need cash. Tissues, soap, you can’t buy these things with food stamps.” To give back, Morris volunteers her free time to help with food distribution. It’s become a community for her. “It’s a place where you can come and be elbow to elbow with people. I like that we can sit, and talk and chill, even if it’s just for the few minutes, the few hours.” When Ramona Ferreyra decided to stop paying rent, it wasn’t just because her apartment was in disrepair. For her and her neighbors in Mitchel Houses in the Bronx, it was about saving public housing. “Lawyers will tell us, do you just want to sue for repairs? And I’m like, ‘No, I’m looking at big systemic issues,’” she said. Ferreyra, a former government employee, wants a class action lawsuit against the New York City housing authority, which owns and maintains the city’s deteriorating public housing buildings. She alleges that the housing authority’s chair, Greg Russ, has purposely allowed apartments to degrade as part of a plan to privatize them. Under Russ’s plan, called the “Blueprint”, NYCHA would transfer as many as 110,000 NYCHA apartments from section 9 – federal public housing – to section 8, a federal voucher program. To qualify for the vouchers, NYCHA would have to declare those units “obsolete”. It could then raise money for repairs by issuing bonds to private investors against those vouchers, using the properties as collateral. Russ says this method could raise as much as $6 for every dollar of federal funding. Ferreyra argues this would effectively kill public housing, as the debt would leave the buildings vulnerable to the investors, who would have far less reason to guarantee tenants’ rights. Under Section 9, tenants enjoy federal protections, including a rent capped at 30% of their income, a right to organize, and eviction protections. “In these spaces, we’re able to thrive and use flex, our imagination and our capacity because you have the safety net of housing,” she said. “So that’s why you have a Nas, that’s why you have a Jay-Z, right? These spaces are incubators for people not to be worried about, ‘Am I going to get evicted next month?’” Four years after renting her first apartment, Marina Quiróz still doesn’t have a key to her building’s entrance – and that’s far from the worst thing about it. The building is filthy, leaky, and constantly breaking down; in the freezing winter, the heat comes on once or twice a day for 15 minutes. The elevator doesn’t work at least three days a week. But nothing has affected her as much as getting harassed by her landlord and superintendent after she lost her hotel cleaning job in March 2020 and could no longer pay rent. “They called and called and came to knock on my door all day at night, sometimes at 9pm,” she said. “The stress was killing me because I didn’t know what to do.” She fell sick from the anxiety, developing hypertension, heart palpitations, dizziness, and pain in her shoulder. Soon, the medical bills started adding up, too. She finally felt relief after meeting members of Community Action for Safe Apartments (Casa), a Bronx non-profit. “I started visiting the office, and I felt there was human warmth,” she said. “I began to know my rights as a tenant. I thought that if something was damaged and the landlord and super didn’t fix it, then I couldn’t do anything. I found out that I can claim my rights, demand them.” On 1 February, the first day her rent was due following the eviction moratorium’s end, Casa announced it would launch an anti-eviction campaign in the Bronx, where 40% of New York City’s evictions occur. Pablo Estupinan, the group’s lead organizer, said that in addition to launching an “eviction defense network” to educate residents about their rights, they would start performing eviction blockades: physically blocking marshals from carrying out evictions – at tenants’ request. Estupinan expects the campaign to go on for years. “It’s been normalized for thousands of people to be evicted, and our job is to stop that. We’ve seen it’s possible with the moratorium.” Now, Quiróz plans to stand in front of the governor’s office and demand an extension of the moratorium until June. “We have to make ourselves seen by the authorities. What are we going to do on the streets during this awfully cold winter? We have to protest, we have to continue with this fight. “We all need help. It’s not just me, Marina Quiróz, it’s the entire city.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘We have to make ourselves seen’: the New York rent strikers fighting eviction,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/09/rent-strike-new-york-evictions
2/9/2022,"There are lies, there are damned lies, and then there are real estate listings. If you have ever wasted hours of your life clicking through houses for sale or rent (are you human? of course you have) then you will know exactly what I mean. That Scandi-chic – and surprisingly affordable – upstate cabin that looked so cute in the photos? It’s actually a crumbling hovel on the side of a highway.  The difference between what you find advertised online and what you actually see when you visit a place can be extreme. I would know: during my time in New York, I have seen bedrooms with no windows (“cozy!”), fire escapes described as “outdoor space”, and one-bedroom apartments magically transformed into three bedroom apartments via removable walls. So how do real estate agents do it? What are the little tricks of the trade to make money-pits look like mansions? In the spirit of public service, I called up a Brooklyn-based realtor to find out. “So you want to know how we make shitty apartments look good?” he said after I gave him my carefully worded spiel. Yes, sir, yes I do. You know this already, but it’s worth emphasizing. The first image you see is the hero shot, the highlight of the house. “We need to make that image clickable,” broker guy tells me. “It’s got to be the Airbnb dream.” How do they do that? Well, sometimes it’s as simple as running out and getting a new couch: “Swapping out that old floppy couch that’s been carted around three different apartments with a new one can increase the sales price immensely.” You’ve been warned: don’t get conned by a couch. You don’t have to be an interior designer to know that strategically placed mirrors can make a room look bigger than it is. As the realtor tells me: “If you put a mirror on the wall that’s near a large window, it looks like it’s brighter and has more exposures than it actually has.” Brokers love mirrors. It’s not deception, it’s décor. Virtual staging, you may have noticed, is all the rage. You’ll click through 10 photos of a picture-perfect house only to realize all the furniture was photoshopped in and the actual listing needs, to borrow from real estate lingo, “a little TLC”. Isn’t virtual staging a little bit misleading, I ask my insider? Nah, he says. They’re not lying to you, they’re just helping you see the property’s potential. They’re doing you a favor, really. There is, he admits, a point at which “helping people imagine a place’s potential” does cross over. “I have seen people virtually stage an entire backyard that doesn’t exist.” The same is true of roof decks. Does your house have a roof? Congratulations, according to some visionaries in the trade, you automatically have a roof deck! Sometimes things aren’t just photoshopped into listings, they’re photoshopped out. Those ugly in-window air-conditioning units you see in a lot of New York apartments? They’re one of the most common victims. “We often digitally remove them,” the broker tells me. “Our justification is that half the year they’re not in use. We don’t want to draw attention to the fact that the apartment doesn’t have central AC; if we can remove that obstacle from their visual field we can get them into the apartment. And if we can get them into the apartment, we can get them to fall in love with other things.” While virtual staging may be a relatively recent phenomenon, real estate agents have always been good at working magic with a camera. Squash yourself against a wall, pull out a wide-angle lens: voila, your room has doubled in size! The right lens and the right angle can make a box room look like a master bedroom, or transform a kid’s paddling pool into a luxury infinity pool. Perspective really is everything. You may think you are a savvy buyer, but the real estate broker knows you’re not. The broker knows that there’s a strong probability you’re gonna buy a cheaply renovated house just because it has an Instagrammable bath. One of the tell-tale signs of a super-cheap renovation, the broker tells me, is putting a big modern tub in a glass-walled shower, which is one of the bathroom trends of the moment. If you see that in an up-and-coming neighborhood, it’s pretty much a given that the place has had the cheapest upgrade possible. Expect everything to start falling apart as soon as you’ve closed. It doesn’t matter to the broker that a bed is literally the only thing that can fit in the room. Nor does it matter that the bedroom doesn’t have a single closet or room for one. Where are you supposed to keep your clothes, you wonder? In the kitchen cupboards? Nope: there’s only one cupboard in the glitzy open-plan kitchen. (There are fancy appliances, though.) Like, you know, the fact that the one-bedroom apartment that costs $2,000 a month doesn’t actually have a toilet. It’s in the communal hall. (The clue in the listing: “A great building to make new friends!”) Or that it faces on to a cemetery. (The clue in the listing: “Quiet neighbors.”) Or that it backs out on to a major trucking route. (The clue in the listing: “Easy access to the highway.”) Or that your neighbors are almost definitely hoarders. (The clue in the listing: absolutely none.) Have you taken a look at the market lately? Rents have ballooned, house prices are out of control, and competition is so fierce one desperate buyer offered to name her first-born child after the vendor (she didn’t get the house). Brokers once had to put in a bit of work to shift terrible houses. Now there’s no need to pad bad listings with creative language and Photoshop: they can just sit back and relax as people outbid each other for a house they haven’t even viewed.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Anatomy of a BS real estate listing: eight tricks we all fall for,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/09/real-estate-housing-rental-listings-tricks-new-york
2/9/2022,"Green campaigners are increasingly concerned that the push for net zero emissions has been undermined by a series of recent government actions. Ministers and government bodies are considering extending a coalmine in Wales and a new one in Cumbria, have approved a new oilfield in the North Sea and the expansion of the airport at Bristol, and are making cuts to public transport services.  These decisions have come while the Treasury is reported to be seeking ways to cut the green levies from fuel bills, which would reduce support for home insulation for poor households, and as some rightwing commentators have clamoured for increased gas production as a solution to soaring energy prices. Jamie Peters, the campaign director at Friends of the Earth, said: “The government are saying one thing and then doing something completely different in a string of recent decisions, and the climate emergency is too important to be treated this way. Their approach to net zero demonstrates either a lack of understanding or a lack of interest in how climate breakdown will affect people here in the UK.” The Abigail oilfield licence was approved by the Oil and Gas Authority last month, despite a UK-commissioned report from the International Energy Agency last year that found no new oil and gas exploration could take place if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C. Similarly, the extension of a coalmine at Aberpergwm in Wales is now under consideration, as is the licence for a new mine in Cumbria that would supply coking coal. After international outcry last year, the government called an inquiry on the Cumbrian plans. That meant a pause while ministers hosted the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow, but the issue is still live and is expected to be resolved soon. Mark Jenkinson, a local Conservative MP who has campaigned for the mine, has called green campaigners “climate terrorists” and is a member of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, a group of about 20 MPs and peers who want to curb or reverse the government’s commitment to reaching net zero emissions. As president of Cop26, the UK has a continuing duty to ensure its resolutions are met, until Egypt takes over as president of the next round of talks this November. That means asking other countries, some of which have large fossil fuel industries, to come up with national plans to reduce their emissions. That will become more difficult if the UK appears to renege on its domestic carbon-cutting plans. Peters said of the recent decisions: “No reasonable person can say that this adds up to a government that understands the scale of action needed. The [net zero] strategy should be strengthened, and rewritten if necessary, to recognise the realities of the climate and ecological emergency. That means no new coal, no new roads, no new airports, and this must be the backbone of everything Whitehall does: it’s not an incidental nice-to-have.” Transport remains another sore point. Rail fares are rising while public transport plans have been scaled back with cuts to rail services and buses. Norman Baker, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: “The government claims it wants public transport to be the ‘natural first choice for all who can take it’ but funding cuts to the rail and bus network will make public transport more expensive, less convenient, less reliable and ultimately less attractive to millions of people who have a choice to drive.” Hopes for a green recovery from the pandemic, which could create jobs in areas from home insulation and renewable energy generation to tree-planting and building flood defences, were also dealt a blow by the levelling up strategy, which relegated green investment to the bottom of its long list of priorities. Ed Matthew, the campaigns director at the climate change thinktank E3G, said this was a mistake, as an insulation programme alone could help to reduce energy bills, create jobs, improve the health of people in cold homes, and reach net zero. He said: “As energy bills go through the roof due to the rocketing cost of gas, it is worth remembering that the most energy-leaking housing stock in western Europe is in the north of England. Fixing it would slash energy bills and emissions while boosting the economy of the north. Failing to put that at the heart of this levelling up strategy is a spectacular own goal.” With Boris Johnson’s premiership hanging by a thread, and his potential rivals courting the right wing of his party, there is widespread concern among green analysts and campaigners that the push for net zero could become a casualty of his weakness. Doug Parr, the policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: “For all the government’s claims to be climate leaders their weak record on delivery in key sectors leaves you pondering just where is this leadership? Recent developments raise real questions about delivering on the promises we made to the international community in Glasgow last November.” He added: “The government has felt quite at home making grand climate statements on the international stage but with Cop26 over, the focus needs to move on. Attention has to turn to the real graft needed to deliver drastic emissions cuts here at home.”",News/Environment,Campaigners fear net zero could be a casualty of Boris Johnson’s weakness,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/09/campaigners-fear-net-zero-could-be-a-casualty-of-boris-johnsons-weakness
2/9/2022,"The UK and Welsh governments are facing a legal challenge over the recent decision to grant a new coal mining licence in south Wales.Legal representatives acting for the Coal Action Network have notified the Coal Authority and the devolved Welsh administration that the group plans to challenge the lawfulness of the decision to permit an expansion of the existing Aberpergwm site in the Neath Valley. Their pre-action letter sets a deadline of 14 February before the organisation will look to file for judicial review proceedings.Amid a continuing row between Whitehall and Cardiff Bay, the full licence for Aberpergwm was awarded just weeks after Boris Johnson’s government called on other countries to “consign coal to history” at Cop26. The deconditionalised permit could allow the firm Energybuild Ltd to extract up to 40m tonnes of high-carbon anthracite (or “hard coal”) over the coming two decades.Devolved ministers maintain that, since the granting of Energybuild’s conditional licence preceded new devolution powers that came into force in 2018, they have been unable to intervene. But the Coal Action Network’s legal team argues that planning permission for the mine extension was consolidated in 2018 by the Neath Port Talbot local authority, which in effect provided an opportunity for the Welsh government to act under the new powers.The Coal Action Network’s lawyers have asked the Coal Authority to withdraw the licence it granted Energybuild last month, while Welsh ministers have been asked to notify the operator and the Coal Authority that they do not authorise the approval of the Aberpergwm application.The legal letter also argues the Coal Authority’s stated position up to now – that essential criteria for the mine expansion were met and, in the absence of external intervention, it therefore had no choice other than to grant the full licence – is a “clear misunderstanding” of its legal powers under the 1994 act that established the body. This, the letter contends, is a narrow misreading of the statute “and thus represents an error of law which independently infects the decision to grant the licence”. The 1994 legislation also states that the Coal Authority has the discretion to consider other factors – of which climate change can be one – when awarding new licences.It has been estimated that the new Aberpergwm scheme may emit more than 100m tonnes of CO2 over its lifetime, while the Global Energy Monitor research group believes the mine expansion could emit somewhere between 200,000 and 1.17m tonnes of methane.The Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg last month defended the colliery expansion, as Whitehall is expected to rule on plans for a major new coalmine in west Cumbria over the coming weeks.A Welsh government spokesperson told the Guardian: “We do not have the powers to make a decision in this case. “This licence predates our powers on coal licensing. The fundamental issue is having a Coal Authority whose duty is to maintain a coal mining industry in the UK.  “We have been calling for the UK government to change this duty in the Coal Industry Act to reflect the climate emergency.”A UK government spokesperson said: “The UK government’s view is that the Coal Industry Act 1994 states, where a coal operator wants to mine in Wales, it must seek the approval of the Welsh ministers as part of its application for a licence to do so. “Our net zero strategy makes it clear that coal has no part to play in our future power generation which is why we’re phasing it out of our electricity by 2024 – a year earlier than planned.” Daniel Therkelsen, a Coal Action Network campaigner, said: “As ministers refuse to respond to the public’s and civil society’s concerns, we must resort to a legal challenge. This is a terrible climate injustice, it must be stopped, and those responsible must be held to account. Granting a licence for this coal mining could open the floodgates to other coal companies that hold conditional coal licences with the Coal Authority. We cannot afford to mine more coal for any purpose.”",News/Environment,Granting of coal mining licence in south Wales faces court challenge,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/09/grant-coal-mining-licence-aberpergwm-south-wales-court-challenge
2/9/2022,"The US postal service (USPS) is facing the mounting fury of the Biden administration, Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups over its plan to spend billions of dollars on a new fleet of gasoline-powered mail delivery trucks that critics say will upend a White House goal to slash planet-heating gases. The USPS has outlined plans to spend $11.3bn on as many as 165,000 new delivery trucks over the next decade to refresh what is one of the largest civilian vehicle fleets in the world. The familiar boxy white trucks with red and blue stripes will be replaced by a new design that has been likened in appearance to a duck.  A full 90% of the fleet, however, will have traditional gas-powered engines, with just 10% being electric. While the new trucks will come with air conditioning, this means their fuel efficiency will be strikingly poor at just 8.2 miles per gallon (3.56 km per litre). This is worse than all of the most popular gas-hungry trucks currently on sale in the US and is even less efficient than the original Hummer, a vehicle infamous for the vast amount of fuel it burned through. “We were optimistic the postal service would listen to us about the benefits of an electric fleet, but it doubled down on its inexplicable preference for polluting trucks,” said Adrian Martinez, senior attorney at Earthjustice. The postal service’s truck contract with Oshkosh Corporation, a Wisconsin-based defence contractor, has sparked uproar within a Biden administration that has set a goal for the federal government to get to net zero emissions by 2050 in order to tackle the climate crisis. Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US and analysts have warned the transition away from gas and diesel cars must speed up if disastrous climate change is to be avoided. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has written to the USPS to complain that the new truck contract is “seriously deficient” in its appreciation of climate concerns. “The postal service’s proposal as currently crafted represents a crucial lost opportunity to more rapidly reduce the carbon footprint of one of the largest government fleets in the world,” wrote Vicki Arroyo, the EPA’s associate administrator for policy. Some commercial delivery operators have started to look closely at electric trucks to meet corporate climate goals and realize the cost savings of running vehicles that generally require less maintenance, and run on cheaper fuel, than the traditional gas option. Amazon, for example, has ordered 100,000 electric trucks from the electric vehicle company Rivian. The USPS, however, has said that it is in a “perilous” financial situation and that it has to choose the most reasonable contract to meet its obligations of delivering to 161m different addresses across the US. “Our commitment to an electric fleet remains ambitious given the pressing vehicle and safety needs of our aging fleet as well as our dire financial condition,” said Louis DeJoy, the USPS postmaster general. “When you’re an independent government entity running billion-dollar annual losses, and with a congressional mandate to operate in a financially sustainable manner, we are compelled to act prudently in the interests of the American public.” The controversy has heightened Democratic calls for the removal of DeJoy, a major donor to Donald Trump who has remained in his post following the previous president’s election loss. The USPS board of governors, which Biden controls appointments to, holds the power to fire postmaster generals. “The postal service urgently needs a change in leadership,” said Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator from Rhode Island. “Under postmaster general DeJoy, the postal service is actively choosing to ignore science and the law in order to make sure one of the world’s largest fleets of government vehicles continues to be a major source of pollution. “Postmaster General DeJoy has messed around with our mail system for too long and he’s caused real harm to the Americans who rely on it. This cannot continue.”",News/Business,US postal service under fire for plan to spend $11.3bn on gas-powered fleet,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/09/us-postal-service-gas-powered-trucks
