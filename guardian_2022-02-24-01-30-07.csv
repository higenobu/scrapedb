2/24/2022,"The government has been urged to tackle “cruel and unjust” waits for defendants in England to Wales to stand trial after new figures showed a 15% yearly rise in the number of people being held for longer than the custody time limit of six months. As of 31 December last year, there were 4,185 people who had been held for more than six months, more than half of whom – 2,279 – were in custody for alleged non-violent offences.  Almost two in five (38%) of those being held longer than six months were in custody for alleged drug offences, with 7% on remand for alleged theft. Others were charged with motoring offences being tried in magistrates courts, public order offences or fraud. The remand population has risen significantly since June 2019, exacerbated by the pandemic and the latest figures, from December 2021, show a continued rise in people being held more than six months, a year and two years, compared with June last year. Griff Ferris, a legal and policy officer at Fair Trials, said: “It’s cruel and unjust to keep people in prison for years awaiting trial. “These unacceptable delays deny justice for everyone involved, including accused people and victims, while being held for months in these incredibly difficult conditions has a devastating impact on people’s lives and wellbeing, as we can see from the shocking rise of self-harm and suicide rates among remand prisoners. “In order to address this crisis and the backlog of cases, the government must adopt meaningful, structural solutions, including de-criminalisation and releasing people from remand, rather than trying to find ways to put more people into prison.” Ministry of Justice figures show that prisoners who were on remand had the highest rate of suicide last year – 2.5 per 1,000 prisoners, up from 1.7 in 2020. They accounted for 37% of all prison suicides, up from 28% the previous year. Many people held in pre-trial detention eventually walk free. In 2020, one in 10 of those remanded before trial were acquitted and one in four of those remanded in custody were not sent to prison following their trial. While the figures, provided by the justice minister James Cartlidge in response to a parliamentary question posed by the Labour MP Alex Cunningham, do not specify whether they include those awaiting sentence as opposed to just those awaiting trial, it is exceptionally rare to be held for more than six months awaiting sentence. They show that 1,710 people had been held in custody for more than a year – compared with 1,523 in 2020 - including 730 for alleged drug offences and 118 for alleged theft. Out of the 1,710, 480 had been held for more than two years. Custody time limits were extended in September 2020 from six to eight months before reverting to six months on 28 June last year. In his written answer, Cartlidge said the number of people held on remand increased due to the suspension of jury trials for a short period in 2020 and reduced capacity because of social distancing. He added: “Judges continue to work to prioritise cases involving CTLs [custody time limits] to ensure they are listed at the first available opportunity, as well as prioritising cases involving vulnerable complainants and witnesses (including youth cases), domestic abuse and serious sex cases.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

2/24/2022,"‘Will you favour me with your eyes, your ears and your voice?” asks John Rwothomack, the writer and performer of this intense, atmospheric monologue as we enter the auditorium. It initially sounds whimsical and mannered as he invites us to play a child’s game while in character as a squeaky-voiced boy. But his questions become commands and take on chilling overtones as he begins his story about Okumu, a Ugandan boy abducted and forced to become a soldier and executioner. We are told to repeat the words of the commander that is training Okumu and then instructed to chant the acronym for the quasi-religious guerrilla rebel group, the Lord’s Resistance Army, established in the 1980s by Joseph Kony, who declared himself the spokesperson for God. It is as if we are not just watching Okumu’s story unfold in the round but also being recruited alongside him.  This lean, hourlong drama has a woefully predictable trajectory: Okumu is terrorised into becoming a terrorist himself. We see his desperate attempts to hold on to his humanity, even when it is being pummelled out of him. Under the inspired direction of Mojisola Elufowoju, Far Gone incorporates a bold form of storytelling, using the oral tradition – and direct address to the audience – alongside movement and mime, often for minutes at a time without accompanying words. As Rwothomack’s first play, the script is sometimes unsubtle but his performance, especially in the non-verbal moments, transports us. Bare-chested and barefoot in childlike long shorts, he plays every character, from gunmen to the cowering child, and has a striking physicality, coiling up to appear tiny and expanding to become the ruthless commander or henchman. Depictions of violence are simulated through shocking, sinewy mime and Rwothomack dextrously plays characters chasing or fighting each other. Some of these scenes become opaque but the drama continues to grip and carry a spirit of fear and menace. William Monks’ lighting and Lee Affen’s creepy sound design (crickets, birdsong, gunfire) add to the tension while the giant mobile of rags overhead casts jagged shadows across Kevin Jenkins’s circular stage, whose ground has the hue of a parched Ugandan bush landscape. No matter how bleak the outcome, Rwothomack proves himself a captivating performer with a powerful story to tell.

2/24/2022,"Europe could heat its citizens’ homes and power its industry on existing gas reserves for the remaining months of a relatively mild winter even if the standoff with Moscow over Ukraine were to escalate to a total stop on Russian gas imports, a leading German economic institute has said. Unusually low gas reserves have raised alarm among several European governments in recent months, with storage tanks across the continent on average at only 31% capacity at the start of this week – roughly half as full as in 2020.  In Germany, reserves have been particularly low in storage tanks run by the Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom, seemingly highlighting the country’s restricted room for meaningful sanctions in the case of an escalating conflict on the Ukrainian border. But after the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, on Tuesday announced a freeze on certifying the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany, and former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev threatened an ensuing doubling in European gas prices, German politicians and economists have struck a note of defiance. According to calculations by the Institute of Energy Economics at the University of Cologne shared with the Guardian, current levels of gas held in European reserves “could compensate for a loss of Russian deliveries” over the next six weeks unless temperatures were to drop dramatically in February or March. The institute’s analysis chimes with a cautiously optimistic report by the German Economic Institute, also published on Wednesday. While a complete loss of Russian gas imports, currently making up almost half of Germany’s gas needs, “will lead to bottlenecks in some European countries”, the Cologne-based institute says such supply shortages “would be limited to up to 10% of demand”. “German citizens not being to heat their homes this year is not a realistic scenario,” the study’s author, Andreas Fischer, told the Guardian. “But European governments have to make sure reserves are topped up again for the next winter.” Fischer said he was encouraged by the growing imports of liquid gas, of which Europe imported a record volume of 11bn cubic metres this January. The report voices scepticism over how quickly Germany will be able to wean itself off natural gas, predicting that its needs will decrease only by 6% to 17% by 2030. “Natural gas will continue to be the central energy source for heating supply in the coming years.” A renewed confidence that energy dependence would not restrain political action in response to Russia’s recognition of the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk in east Ukraine was shared in Berlin and Brussels, reported Der Spiegel. “The fear of a stop of gas deliveries appears to have melted away like remaining snow at the end of the winter”, wrote the news magazine. A report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy even asserts bullishly that Russia stopping gas deliveries would hit the Russia’s economy harder than Europe’s. “A trade stop with gas would result in a slump in Russian economic output of just under 3%”, the study claimed. “For Germany and the EU, there would hardly be any economic damage.” According to the northern German institute’s calculations, a gas embargo would lead Russia’s gross domestic product (GDP) to slump by 2.9%. Germany’s GDP, it argues, would slightly increase by 0.1%, as western allies would replace Russian imports with those from each other.",News/World news,"Europe could see out winter on gas reserves if Russian imports stop, says German analysis",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/europe-winter-gas-reserves-russian-imports-german-analysis-ukraine

2/24/2022,"When director Francis Ford Coppola and screenwriter-novelist Mario Puzo released The Godfather 50 years ago, the mobster had already been a stock figure in film for half a century. Their genius (and that of the film’s own godfather, producer Robert Evans) was to reinvent these criminals as a dysfunctional dynastic psychodrama. They took the figure of the ageing don as seriously as Lear, the careworn ruler of a secret American state-within-a-state. Stomach-turning flourishes of violence are juxtaposed with elaborate rituals of familial piety and respect, which generations of real-life criminals in the United States treated as how-to behaviour manuals for decades afterwards. These Italian-American gangsters do not complain about the bigotry heading their way, and are themselves casually racist and antisemitic. Extravagant gestures of romantic adoration and solemn respect for womenfolk are combined with casual sexual abuse; and women have to reconcile themselves to their role: a pretext for revenge. (A tour guide in Sicily once told me that the word “mafia” is taken from the Italian phrase “non toccare ma figlia” – don’t touch my daughter – an explanation I have yet to see confirmed anywhere else.) There is a toxic chill to the film’s opening speech, from a local undertaker piteously demanding the Don take revenge on his behalf against two over-privileged white boys who have raped and disfigured his daughter. Many cannot forgive this film for sentimentalising mob violence with this fantasy rationale.  Marlon Brando is as hypnotic as a cobra playing ageing gangster patriarch Vito Corleone, his cottonwool jowl-padding giving something extra to that unmistakable adenoidal wheeze. He is hosting a colossal family wedding for his daughter Connie (Talia Shire): a magnificent set-piece scene that itself has more energy, detail and dramatic interest than most entire films. The don will, with stately calm and an upheld finger, like a cardinal or the Pope himself, listen to murmured information or advice in his ear. Vito’s wife Carmela (a name that reverberated in the later 90s era of The Sopranos) says little or nothing. Vito’s aggressive hothead son Sonny (James Caan) is at the party, a married man furtively having sex with a bridesmaid; present also is the weakling son Fredo (John Cazale), who is drunk in an undignified, undisciplined way. But the old don is pining for his favourite son, Michael (a stunningly charismatic performance from Al Pacino), a decorated second world war veteran with no interest in the family business. Michael shows up late, handsome in his uniform: indicating the transferable military skills. With him is his wasp fiancee Kay (Diane Keaton). Vito’s trusted consigliere, Tom Hagen, is the unofficial son: a brilliant, atypically self-effacing performance from Robert Duvall. It is quiet Tom who is to supervise, off-camera, the film’s most diabolical act of violence: kidnapping the racehorse (Godfather superfans will know the horse’s name) belonging to a Hollywood producer who has to be intimidated into giving a role to the Don’s Sinatra-esque godson Johnny Fontane (Al Martino), drugging it, cutting off its head and placing it in the sleeping man’s bed. Eerily, this producer (played by Cassavetes veteran John Marley) had the night before given an impassioned speech denouncing Fontane’s ruination of an innocent actress, a weird echo of the undertaker’s speech to the don about his daughter. But all this is the calm before the storm, as the crime families’ peace accord disintegrates, with the coming of drugs. Virgil “The Turk” Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) offers Vito a piece of his growing new heroin business; the don refuses, apparently because he disapproves of this evil trade, or perhaps because he thinks his cut isn’t big enough. Affronted by the refusal and suspecting the Corleones simply intend to launch an attack for all of his business, Sollozzo’s men launch a pre-emptive strike, shooting Vito as he buys oranges from a market, and of course pathetic, incompetent Fredo is unable to protect his father. (Again: Godfather superfans can tell you which Jake LaMotta fight is being advertised on the poster in the background of this shot.) And as Vito lies in hospital, having miraculously survived, it is Michael who realises at this moment that his destiny is to abandon his claim to the respectable American dream and take over the family business. It is to culminate in the now legendary sequence in which Michael becomes a godfather to his sister’s child and the baptismal service is intercut with nightmarish vignettes showing the slaying of all the rival bosses. The point of course being: this is Michael’s own baptism. Coppola’s epic storytelling sweep is magnificent: there is an electric charge in simply the shift from New York to California to Sicily and back to New York. This is the top-down approach to gangsters, the “great man” theory of organised crime. Later movies such as Scorsese’s Goodfellas will emphasise the more ragged lower ranks (although Paul Sorvino’s Paulie Cicero insists on the Corleone-esque murmuring in the ear) and David Chase’s The Sopranos showed the Italian-American mob in decline. My own view is that one of the greatest post-Godfather movies is Abel Ferrara’s The Funeral, which lays out the hellish sense of self-replicating sin and shame in the criminal world. Coppola was to follow his epic masterpiece with the equally ambitious and audacious The Godfather Part II, a sequel/prequel that is often thought of as even better. Brilliant though that second film is, I think the original will always have the edge in its simplicity, clarity and brutal power.  The Godfather is released on 25 February in cinemas.",Arts/Film,The Godfather review – a brutal sweep of magnificent storytelling,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/23/the-godfather-review-a-brutal-sweep-of-magnificent-storytelling
2/24/2022,"Hot summer temperatures drive up the number of people suffering mental health emergencies, the most comprehensive study to date has found. The analysis of medical records from millions of US citizens showed an average 8% rise in the rate of emergency hospital visits on days when the temperature was in the top 5% of those recorded across the decade-long study.  The effect was seen for almost all mental health conditions, including stress, mood and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, self-harm, and substance use disorders. The frequency of extreme temperatures is being driven up by the climate crisis, and the researchers said their work could help mental health services predict and prepare for times of greater need. “People are familiar with the risks of extreme heat in terms of dehydration, heatstroke, etc,” said Prof Gregory Wellenius, at the Boston University school of public health in the US and senior author of the research. “What’s really novel is that this study establishes at an unprecedented scale that days of extreme heat can also impact people’s mental health in a substantial way. And this isn’t just for a niche, vulnerable population. This is in every age bracket we looked at, for both men and women, and in every region of the country. Everybody is at risk.” The medical database used for the analysis did not include people without health insurance. “We expect [the 8% rise in risk] is an underestimate of the true burden of disease associated with extreme heat, because the most vulnerable individuals are less likely to be in this database and, frankly, less likely to be treated in the same way for mental health,” Wellenius said. Emergency visits to hospitals are the most severe presentations of mental health disorders, said Prof Amruta Nori-Sarma, also at Boston University and first author of the study: “Even small increases in the number of emergency department visits represent a huge burden to the individuals and to the system.” The study showed the biggest increase in the rate of emergency visits was across the north of the US, rising to 12% in the north-west region. That might appear counterintuitive, said Nori-Sarma, as temperatures in the southern US are hotter: “But we see the opposite.” The reason may be that those living in hotter places are already better adapted, with more access to air conditioners, for example. “This finding is important from a future vulnerability perspective, as we can expect that populations that don’t have those adaptive capacities might be more stressed during times of extreme heat,” she said. According to a report in May 2021, the climate crisis is inflicting huge hidden costs on the mental health of people around the world, such as heatwaves increasing rates of suicide, floods leaving victims traumatised, and loss of food security, homes and livelihoods causing stress and depression. The latest research, which was published in the journal Jama Psychiatry, examined anonymised data on 3.5m emergency hospital visits for mental health disorders made by 2.2 million people from 2010-2019. The study focused on the warmest months, May to September, and covered 2,775 counties, which account for 98% of US citizens. Seven of the warmest years on record for the US have occurred since 2014, the researchers noted. The increased risk was slightly higher for men than for women, the scientists found, potentially because men are less likely to seek early help and may therefore need emergency care more frequently. The only major mental health disorders that did not prompt a rise in emergency visits on hot days were personality and behavioural disorders, which are relatively rare and therefore had a smaller sample. The rise in emergency visit rates was similar for most disorders, the researchers said, indicating that the heat exacerbates existing conditions. This could be due to increasing daytime irritation or discomfort or by disruption of sleep during hot nights. “It’s increasingly clear that a changing climate threatens our bodies and our minds,” said Dr Emma Lawrance of Imperial College London, UK, and not part of the study. “While the effect is relatively small, it has big implications for public health and healthcare systems as climate change increases the number of days of extreme heat; children born today will experience seven times as many heatwaves as their grandparents.” She added: “It’s not just people with more severe symptoms of mental ill-health who are affected by heat – many of us have more symptoms of anxiety, depression and lower mood at higher temperatures. The effects are unequal though, with poorer communities often more exposed to heat. “We need climate mitigation to help prevent worsening of these impacts, and climate adaptation to provide more tree cover and access to green space to prevent urban ‘heat islands’.” The study used a “case-crossover” design, where individuals are followed over a period of time and can therefore serve as their own experimental controls. A person’s increased risk of an emergency visit on a hot day was calculated by comparing that day with the same day of the week in the week before and after. This cancels out other personal factors that might influence the results, such as age or occupation.",News/Environment,"Hot days lead to more mental health emergencies, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/23/hot-days-drive-up-mental-health-emergencies-climate-crisis-study-finds
2/24/2022,"Having an asteroid slam into Earth was catastrophic for the dinosaurs, but the season of the strike may have substantially ramped up extinction rates for others species, research suggests. Scientists have found evidence that the devastating impact 66 million years ago, which wiped out three quarters of Earth’s species and created the Chicxulub crater in modern day Mexico, happened in the spring in the northern hemisphere.  The timing means that many animals north of the equator would have been particularly vulnerable to the intense heatwave unleashed by the collision, having just emerged from the harsh months of winter. Other animals in the south may have fared better given that it was autumn, especially if they were hunkering down in burrows. The direct hit from the asteroid triggered an extreme global heatwave that proved lethal for many exposed animals. In the aftermath, temperatures are thought to have plummeted in a nuclear winter that drove many more species to extinction. “To be able to fight that nuclear winter, you first had to survive the actual impact,” said Melanie During, a palaeontologist at Uppsala University in Sweden. “Anything in the southern hemisphere already sheltering had a much better chance of surviving.” When the asteroid hit, it blasted molten rock into space which crystallised and rained back to Earth as “impact spherules” the same day. The scientists found some of these spherules lodged in the gills of fossilised paddlefish and sturgeon excavated from a fossil site called Tanis in North Dakota. The discovery of more spherules around the fossils suggest that the glassy particles were still falling when the fish perished, linking the time of death to the day, and potentially even the hour, of the impact. The fish appear to have died when they were buried alive by sediment shaken up in the collision. Writing in the journal Nature, the scientists describe how they identified seasonal cycles in the growth rates of the fish bones, along with changes in carbon isotopes linked to seasonal variations in the abundance of zooplankton, a dietary staple for the fish. The findings all point to the fish dying – and so the asteroid colliding – in the spring. Separate research on the fossils published in December by Prof Phillip Manning at the University of Manchester reached a similar conclusion. It is unclear whether small animals in the northern hemisphere actually fared worse than those in the south, however. Dennis Voeten, a co-author on the latest study at Uppsala University, said there is evidence that northern hemisphere turtles were wiped out in the asteroid strike, after which their habitats were repopulated by turtles from the south. Dr Daniel Field, an assistant professor of vertebrate palaeontology at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the research, said it was “plausible” that northern hemisphere animals were hit harder by the catastrophe. “If the asteroid struck at a biologically sensitive point of the year for many northern hemisphere organisms, it could have contributed to extinction rates that were even more elevated than might have been expected otherwise,” he said. But he added that nothing much larger than a house cat survived the asteroid impact and that many species would have been doomed whenever it hit. “The large non-avian dinosaurs probably would have gone extinct regardless of when during the year the asteroid struck,” he said.",News/Science,"Springtime asteroid hit ramped up extinction rates, say scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/23/springtime-asteroid-hit-ramped-up-extinction-rates-say-scientists
2/24/2022,"Boris Johnson could not have been more clear. “I just think it’s very important that the house understands: we do not raise money from Russian oligarchs.” Some opposition MPs laughed, and it very much is the case that the prime minister was accurate only in a strict legalistic sense. It would be impossible for someone with only Russian nationality, however rich, to donate legally to a UK political party. What has undoubtedly happened is that a series of people with dual UK-Russian nationality, or with significant business links with Russia, have donated heavily to the Conservatives in recent years.  A Labour party calculation based on Electoral Commission information estimated that donors who had made money from Russia or Russians had given £1.93m to either the Tory party or constituency associations since Johnson became prime minister. Others put the sum higher. Ian Blackford, the SNP’s Westminster leader, to whom Johnson was replying in the Commons on Wednesday, said the Tories had raised £2.3m “from Russian oligarchs”. Oligarch is a loose term but is often associated in this context with very rich people who generally made their money amid the financial free-for-all of the post-Soviet and Putin era, and who often keep close links to the Russian president. Those who have donated to the Tories since Johnson entered No 10 in July 2019 deny either that any of their wealth has murky origins, or that they are under any sort of Russian influence over how they use it. The biggest single donor of this group is the financier Lubov Chernukhin, who has donated £700,000. A British national since 2011, she is married to Vladimir Chernukhin, a former deputy finance minister under Putin. Documents published in the Pandora papers in October suggest he was allowed to leave Russia in 2004 with assets worth about $500m (£366m) and retain Russian business connections. The couple’s lawyers say that none of Vladimir Chernukhin’s wealth was acquired in a corrupt manner, and that none of his wife’s donations were funded by improper means or affected by the influence of anyone else. What is certain is that Lubov Chernukhin is a generous donor and something of a presence in Tory circles; she had the winning bid at the party’s 2020 fundraising ball for the prize of a game of tennis with Johnson. Shortly before Johnson became PM, Liz Truss, then international trade secretary, posted a photo to Instagram of what she termed a “ladies’ night”, posing alongside Theresa May and a series of other female Tory MPs, plus Lubov Chernukhin. The industrialist Alexander Temerko, also a UK national, has donated £357,000 since Johnson took office. He is a minority shareholder and co-owner of a company called Aquind. Its majority investor is the Russian-born oil tycoon Viktor Fedotov. Another big Tory donor in the Johnson era is the businessman Mohamed Amersi, who has given £258,000 over the period. Amersi advised on a lucrative telecom deal in Russia in 2005 with a company that a Swiss tribunal subsequently found to be controlled by an associate of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Amersi told the Financial Times in July he had made $7m in the country, but only prior to 2008. “Not a penny that I earned in Russia … has even remotely come close to being invested in the UK political system,” he said. Under electoral laws for Great Britain – they vary slightly in Northern Ireland – donations to parties can be made only by people on the UK electoral register, or from UK-registered companies and other organisations such as unions. The only people allowed to go on the electoral register in England are British citizens, people with EU citizenship living in the UK, and Commonwealth citizens who can live in the UK.",News/Politics,Party funding linked to Russia – how much have Tories benefited?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/23/oligarchs-funding-tories
2/24/2022,"The omens are decidedly mixed for Manchester United before their Round of Arsenal tie against Atlético Madrid in Big Cup. On the one hand, they boast a certain Cristiano Ronaldo. Over a long period of time, the old boy has regularly heaped misery upon woe on to Diego Simeone’s fuming noggin. CR37 scored against Atléti for city neighbours Real to help his side win the 2014 final. He slotted the winning penalty against them in the 2016 final. He swatted them aside in the 2017 semis with a hat-trick, then scored another treble for Juventus in a stupidly dramatic comeback from 2-0 down at this stage in 2019. It’s fair to say he’s got their number … specifically 25, which is how many goals he’s scored in 35 meetings. Poor Diego. Po’ Diego’s a-cold.  On the other hand, Atlético can take succour from a little history of their own. On the only other occasion these two clubs have met, in the old Cup Winners’ Cup in 1991, they trounced United 4-1 on aggregate, prising Lord Ferg’s fingers off the trophy his side had lifted just six months earlier. Some legendary names were involved in that tie. Paulo Futre opened the scoring for Luis Aragones’ team as they romped to a 3-0 win in Madrid, while Bernd Schuster equalised in the return at Old Trafford. United’s solitary consolation that evening was scored by, who else, a young Cristiano Ronaldo. Subs please check. So if history and mathematics teach us anything, six equals half a dozen. However there’s one other, possibly more relevant, factor that may tip the scales decisively in United’s balance: Atléti are all over the shop at the minute. While Ralf Rangnick’s men are admittedly a mercurial work in progress at best, shambolic if we’re feeling less generous, they’re a Cityesque model of consistency compared to Simeone’s shower. World famous as the last word in resolute, no-nonsense, epic outhousery, Atléti have momentarily misplaced their staunch sanitary-chamber mojo, and having lost seven of their last 13, currently exude all the snarling potty-time menace of the Andrex puppy.
