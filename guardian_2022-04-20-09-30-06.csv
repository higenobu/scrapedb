4/20/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the intensity of fire by Russian troops towards Kharkiv, the Donbas and in Dnipro has “increased significantly”, one day after the Kremlin launched its long-anticipated offensive in eastern Ukraine. Russian officials said a total of 1,260 military targets were hit by rockets and artillery along the 300-mile frontline in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions. Zelenskiy said the situation in the besieged city of Mariupol is “as severe as possible”. “The Russian army is blocking any efforts to organise humanitarian corridors and save our people,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly address. “The fate of at least tens of thousands of Mariupol residents who were previously relocated to Russian-controlled territory is unknown.” The Russian defence ministry said it would offer a ceasefire in Mariupol on Wednesday to allow Ukrainian defenders holed up in the Azovstal steelworks to lay down their arms. Russian-backed fighters have been storming the plant, according to a pro-Russian official cited by the BBC. Ukrainian authorities say that no fewer than 1,000 civilians are hiding in the complex along with Ukrainian fighters. Russian forces have seized Kreminna in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region and Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from the city, the regional governor said. Kreminna, a city of more than 18,000 people about 350 miles (560km) south-east of Kyiv, appears to be the first city captured in a Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. The mayor of Kharkiv, Ihor Terekhov, said Russian forces have been engaged in “non-stop bombardment of civilian districts” in Ukraine’s second city since Sunday. Four people, including three emergency workers, were killed on Tuesday, according to Terekhov. Separately, the prosecutor’s office for the Kharkiv region said Russian rockets wounded 14 people in the city on Tuesday. A Russian businessman, Oleg Tinkov, has spoken out against the “crazy” war in Ukraine and described supporters of Moscow’s military actions as “morons”. In an Instagram post, Tinkov, who has been sanctioned by the UK government, said “90% of Russians are against” the war. Russia has increased its offensive in the Donbas but its progress has been hampered by “environmental, logistical and technical challenges”, the UK said. “Russia’s inability to stamp out resistance in Mariupol and their indiscriminate attacks, which have harmed the resident civilian populace, are indicative of their continued failure to achieve their aims as quickly as they would like,” the UK Ministry of Defence said late on Tuesday. Russia has deployed up to 20,000 mercenaries from Syria, Libya and elsewhere in Ukraine’s Donbas region, according to a European official. The official said mercenaries are being sent into battle with no heavy equipment or armoured vehicles. In his nightly address, Zelenskiy claimed if Ukraine had access to all the weapons it needs, “and which are comparable to the weapons used by the Russian Federation, we would have already ended this war. It is unfair that Ukraine is still forced to ask for what its partners have been storing somewhere for years.” The US president, Joe Biden, will announce another military aid package for Ukraine roughly the same size as the $800m one the US president announced last week, multiple sources told Reuters, which would bring to more than $3bn the total US aid to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion. Russia is expelling 31 Dutch, Belgian and Austrian diplomats as Moscow faces increased international isolation. It comes after the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria announced the expulsion of some Russian diplomats. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has called for a four-day Orthodox Easter humanitarian pause in fighting in Ukraine. Guterres said the UN was ready to send humanitarian aid convoys to Mariupol, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk beginning on Holy Thursday and running through Sunday 24 April, the date of Orthodox Easter, which is celebrated by most Ukrainians and Russians.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 56 of the invasion ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-56-of-the-invasion
4/20/2022,"The teacher’s union has criticised Labor’s education policy for a “concerning” lack of detail about when public schools will get extra funding. Australian Education Union president, Correna Haythorpe, welcomed the policy to put public schools on a “pathway” to full funding but said the lack of a timeline “is of concern to us”. Before the 2019 election Labor promised $14bn over 10 years for public education, but the policy was dropped after it was identified in Labor’s election review as one of the expensive items that required the opposition to propose more revenue raising measures. Last week, the shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek, said Labor had not recommitted to that spending because the current school funding agreements run to the end to 2023 and need to be renegotiate with the states. “We’ll work with every state and territory to get every school on a pathway to reaching its fair funding level,” she said. Public schools receive 20% of the schooling resourcing standard (SRS) from the federal government and 75% from the states, creating a gap of 5% that needs to be closed. Given 2.6 million students are in the public system and each costs the government an average of $20,180 a year, education stakeholders estimate bringing public schools up to the SRS could cost $2.6bn a year. Haythorpe said that Labor’s commitment was “clear but plain”: to negotiate new agreements with the states to help achieve fair funding, but without a specific funding commitment or timeframe. “We could deeply navel gaze about [what that means], but there is simply no information beyond a ‘pathway’ to achieve 100% funding, to be negotiated after the election.” “There is no timeline, that is of concern to us. We want to achieve 100% funding in a meaningful way, as soon as possible.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Haythorpe said a timeline would “provide certainty”, but still praised Labor for committing to the principle of full funding, in contrast to the Coalition which had offered “nothing at all”. Plibersek said that “halfway through an agreement, as we are now, we’re not going to start talking about what would be in the next agreement”. “What we can say is every school, every underfunded public school, will be better off under Labor, and Catholic and independent schools will not have their funding touched, they’ll continue to receive the funding that they’re receiving now under the same funding formula.” “We want to make sure that every child in every school in every part of Australia gets the chance of a world class education. “In contrast, this government has seen Australian school kids go backwards in international testing.” In January Labor promised $440m for new grant funding to help students and teachers manage the pandemic, for projects such as better ventilation, building upgrades and mental health services. Labor has also promised up to 20,000 extra university places over 2022 and 2023, and 465,000 free Tafe places in nominated areas of skills shortages. In January the Greens proposed giving public schools $49bn over 10 years, to fully fund all costs including out-of-pocket fees charged to parents and guardians. The AEU will be spending $3.5m on its election campaign, which calls for “every school, every child” to receive fair education funding and says that “[Scott] Morrison must go” to achieve this. The union has printed 1m leaflets for its target electorates and 650,000 for its supporters to letterbox drop. Target electorates include Eden Monaro, Macquarie and Reid in New South Wales; Corangamite and Chisholm in Victoria; Swan, Pearce and Hasluck in Western Australia; Bass and Braddon in Tasmania; and Boothby in South Australia. After the March budget, Plibersek and the AEU accused the Morrison government of cutting $560m from public schools relative to the 2021-22 budget. In April, education department officials told Senate estimates although there was a $560m reduction relative to last year’s projections, public school funding was still increasing by $1.5bn over four years. The deputy secretary for schools, Ros Baxter, said no student would miss out because funding is uncapped and demand-driven. “Every student who is there with the characteristics they have attracts the funding they’re entitled to.” The $560m decreased projection reflects a “combination of census data, trends of attrition and ABS population data”, she said. Labor senator Louise Pratt said the AEU had calculated the figure implied an assumption that there would be “55,000 fewer students” in the public system in 2024, which Baxter rejected.",News/Australia news,National teacher’s union ‘concerned’ by lack of detail in Labor’s public school funding policy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/20/national-teachers-union-concerned-by-lack-of-detail-in-labors-public-school-funding-policy
4/20/2022,"Labor will consider reinstating a $1.3bn program for Australia to acquire armed drones if it wins the election, vowing to review the Coalition’s “bewildering” decision to scrap it “as a matter of urgency”. The shadow defence minister, Brendan O’Connor, said he was concerned there was a “very significant capability gap in the immediate future”, and he would seek detailed advice after the election. In a wide-ranging interview, O’Connor also raised “systemic” problems with the delivery of defence projects and promised more stringent oversight if appointed minister. O’Connor sought to undercut the Coalition’s central campaign message of its strength on national security. “The gap between its elevated rhetoric on defence and national security and its failure to deliver is huge,” he said. Officials revealed in a Senate committee hearing earlier this month that the government had quietly scrapped a $1.3bn armed drones program to partly offset the cost of a cybersecurity package dubbed Redspice. Under the now-cancelled SkyGuardian program, which the Department of Defence said provided “an excellent capability system”, Australia planned to acquire up to 12 armed drones. O’Connor said the defence minister, Peter Dutton, had been singing the praises of such assets in recent months, so the “inexplicable” decision “does demand explanation”. He said Labor supported Redspice, but not at the expense of cancelling the drones. He noted Ukraine was seeking armed drones. “Frankly, that is a very bewildering decision by the government and we’d be examining that as a matter of urgency if elected,” O’Connor said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning O’Connor said a Labor government would act on advice because defence capability decisions could not be made from opposition. “It is incumbent upon any government to assess our capability gaps now, not just in the medium to long term,” he said. “We’d be looking at increasing firepower and certain defence assets where we are deficient, and I would suggest one of the areas that’s deficient includes uncrewed, armed drones.” V-Adm David Johnston, the vice-chief of the Australian defence force, has previously said the cancellation was “a result of a decision to prioritise a cyber capability and we needed to determine the funding to achieve that”. O’Connor said the government’s 2020 strategic update noted the warning time for a serious conflict was no longer 10 years, but most of the Coalition’s significant announcements were “looking at delivery of assets or increased personnel in 15 or 20 years’ time”. “That’s fine, but it’s not enough,” he said. Labor supports Aukus, under which Australia seeks at least eight nuclear-propelled submarines, but the first of the new boats is not likely to be operational until the late 2030s. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has said a Labor government would consider interim options such as fitting Tomahawk missiles to Australia’s existing Collins class submarines. Like the government, O’Connor stopped short of giving a firm commitment to the exact level of domestic construction of the nuclear-powered submarines, given that the 18-month joint study with the US and the UK is yet to be completed. “I think we need to get a briefing from the ADF and the defence department but my inclination is to build assets here – that’s my starting point and I’d have to be convinced otherwise,” he said. An immediate priority on coming to government would be to examine all existing contracts “to ensure they’re on track”. O’Connor said he was concerned about challenges with the $45bn future frigates project, although his inclination was “to fix any problems with an existing contract … and get on with the job of delivering the assets rather than making decisions to cancel”. O’Connor accused the Coalition of having a “blind spot” on the national security threats posed by global heating, in contrast to the assessment of the US, the UK and Pacific island countries. He said a Labor government would draw up a climate security white paper. Labor was “very concerned” about the newly signed security agreement between China and Solomon Islands, and believed the Australian government had “dropped the ball” in the Pacific. Dutton has attempted to discredit O’Connor, saying his opponent would “never bring the strength needed to the defence portfolio”. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has labelled O’Connor a “failed immigration minister” and questioned whether he would be appointed as defence minister. Albanese has said he expected “everyone to stay in their current jobs”. O’Connor, a former home affairs and immigration minister, said he was “happy to take on this portfolio” and he did not expect Dutton to sing his praises. Guardian Australia has also requested an interview with Dutton.",News/Australia news,Labor to rethink Coalition’s ‘bewildering’ decision to scrap armed drones if it wins election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/20/labor-to-rethink-coalitions-bewildering-decision-to-scrap-armed-drones-if-it-wins-election
