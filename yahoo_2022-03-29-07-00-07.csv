3/29/2022,"The second black box, as well as a heartbreaking handwritten note from a passenger, has been found among the wreckage of ill-fated China Eastern Airlines flight MU5735.

The note, reportedly written by a woman with the surname Xiang, contains a description of a jade pendant, which, in Chinese culture, symbolizes “peace, luck and safety.”

Xiang, who was a livestreaming salesperson in her 20s, wrote, “The jade disc lucky charm symbolizes hope for peace in the year and a long and healthy life.”

Over the weekend, Chinese aviation officials confirmed that all 123 passengers and nine crew members aboard Flight MU5735 were dead, following the plane’s tragic crash in the mountainous region of Southern China last week.

The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) made the official statement after rescue teams searched the crash site for days.

So far, authorities have identified 120 of the victims (114 passengers and six crew members) using DNA testing.

Flight MU5735 was traveling from Kunming City to Guangzhou on Monday last week when it lost contact with ground control and made a sudden dive into the mountains.

On Tuesday, a representative from the airline shared that the passenger aircraft was ""flying normally"" a little over an hour before it made its sudden descent. All crew members were also deemed healthy and qualified before the plane took off, based on pre-flight examinations.

The crash remains under investigation by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) as state media reported on Sunday that search teams had already found the plane's second black box, which contains the flight data recorder.

The first black box, which contains the cockpit voice recorder, was discovered on Wednesday and sent to Beijing for analysis. Contents of both devices are expected to provide important information on what went wrong before the crash.

The investigation, which will involve the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, could reportedly take months to complete. Air crash investigators also pointed out that the plane’s severe damage will make the investigation ""very difficult.""

Following a call from China's top insurance regulator to ensure the victims’ families are assisted with their insurance claims, China Eastern Airlines said it has created a team to handle the processing of the compensation plans.

Multiple people spotted a mysterious beam of light in the sky last week. The “red flare”, as many described it, was spotted by people in Houston and other places throughout the world. While the strange red flare might give off extraterrestrial vibes due to its mystery, the phenomenon was most likely nothing quite as extraordinary, some say.

Cook perfect steak and chicken every time with this discounted Amazon best-seller People spotted the mysterious red flare over Houston, Texas the night of Wednesday, March 23, 2022. Others noticed it over Pearland, League City, Deer Park, and Missouri City, ABC13 reports. But a similar mysterious beam of light was also spotted on the other side of the world, in areas like Egypt, several days before. You can see the light in the video above from KHOU11. While some have had some interesting theories as to what the mysterious beam of light is, many have attributed the red flare to a light pillar. Light pillars appear when lights move through ice crystals in the sky. It creates a beam-like look of light that shoots up into the sky. You can get a good view of light pillars in this photo capturing the Northern Lights and light pillars side by side. Light pillars are a beautiful sight. However, they aren’t nearly as mysterious as some of the other possibilities floating around for the beam of light. Some may believe that the beam is extraterrestrial in nature. It wouldn’t be the first time someone saw unidentified lights in the sky and thought them alien in nature. Considering scientists believe there are aliens in the universe, it isn’t entirely impossible, I suppose. ABC13’s chief meteorologist Travis Herzog says that the severe weather around Texas on Monday and Tuesday of last week would have been enough to make the air high above exceptionally cold. This would have given room for ice crystals to form in the air, allowing the light to sift through them. That in turn, could have created the mysterious beam of light people witnessed. Herzog also says a flare-up at a chemical plant or refinery in the area was most likely the cause of the light pillar. Others on Twitter agreed with Herzog’s assessment, mirroring similar beliefs. Nothing has been verified, though. What’s most interesting about this mysterious beam of light is the fact that it was also seen over Egypt sometime before it appeared over Texas. It’s possible that a similar type of factory experienced a similar flare-up over in Egypt. Or it could be something else entirely. Many on Reddit seem to think it could be aliens. The unfortunate truth is, there’s just a lot about the world, and our universe, that we don’t understand. Both on our planet and beyond it. After all, someone recently thought they’d found a UFO submerged at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn’t. All we can do right now is scratch our heads in wonder about this mysterious beam of light seen in the sky. Click here to read the full article.

3/29/2022,"A champion kickboxer, Maksym Kagal, was reportedly killed in battle Friday in Ukraine. His coach said in a Facebook post that Kagal died March 25 in Mariupol. The coach added that he died ""as part of the Special Destination Squad 'Azov'."" Kickboxing champion Maksym Kagal was killed in battle Friday while defending Ukraine from the ongoing Russian invasion in the city Mariupol. Kagal, 30, reportedly died as part of the controversial Azov special forces — a battalion of up to 1,500 members that has been frequently characterized by The Guardian, MSNBC, and Al-Jazeera, as a far-right paramilitary group with some fighters who displayed neo-Nazi leanings. ""Unfortunately, the war takes the best,"" Kagal's combat sports coach Oleh Skyrta said in a Facebook post. Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24 with Vladimir Putin attempting to justify the aggression because of a goal to ""denazify"" the country. In the weeks since, more than 10 million people have been displaced as multiple Ukraine towns and cities have been shelled from Russian aggression. Thousands have died. Skyrta said Kagal died on March 25 while ""defending the city of Mariupol, as part of the Special Destination Squad 'Azov'."" The kickboxing coach then listed Kagal's achievements as the first world champion kickboxer from his gym. He called him ""an honest and decent man."" Skyrta finished by remarking: ""Rest in peace, brother … we will take revenge on you."" The Azov Special Operations Unit was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia. It was incorporated into the National Guard later that year. Though it denies links to neo-Nazism, it has used controversial imagery and symbols linked to Nazism. A battalion spokesperson even told USA Today in 2015 that up to 20% of its members were Nazis.

3/29/2022,"Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma details rising gas prices' impact on foot traffic in retail stores, decreased grocery store visits, and a decline in stops to gas stations. - Higher gas prices are taking a toll on retail, according to a new report from Data Intelligence platform, Placer.ai. Our very own Brooke DiPalma is here with the details. Brooke, what can you tell us? BROOKE DIPALMA: Rachelle, well, it really is the perfect storm hitting retailers right now. It's the Ukraine-Russia war supply chain strain and that ongoing inflation on both food and gas prices. Just today, prices at the pump are beginning to see a bit of relief here. According to AAA, the current national average of gas is about $4.25. Now, according to Placer.ai, that price per gallon is still $1.37 higher than a year ago. Now, if you take a look at retail foot traffic, weekly visits, according to Placer.ai, during the week of March 7, visits to US retailers decreased by about 4.3%. That's compared to three years ago in the year of 2019. But this marks the steepest decline of weekly foot traffic visits over the past 12 months that were not directly correlated with the impact of COVID-19 or the influx of the holidays. Now, Rachelle, a lot of questions have been asked if these higher prices have led to more visits to discount or Dollar Tree stores. But Placer.ai found that it, in fact, did not have a meaningful shift here. They found that, over the past week of February 28 to March 7, all three categories-- grocery stores, superstores like Walmart and Target, in addition to discount and dollar stores, saw low single digit growth compared to 2021. Then during the week of March 14, visits to grocery stores and discount stores were slightly up, while superstore visits were slightly down. But like I said, not a meaningful shift here to contribute-- or conclude that people were jumping to discount and dollar stores here. But all these major headwinds certainly taking a toll on visits to retailers here in the US. - Now, it's interesting because one big-box retailer seems to be benefiting from the current events, according to the report. Break down which one and why. BROOKE DIPALMA: Rachelle, that's right. Costco, a big winner here. They noted that they really are the one stop shop. It's food. It's consumer product goods. And it's also those Costco gasoline locations that are really bringing in the big bucks here. When a consumer has to use their membership card in order to take advantage of these gasoline prices, visits are certainly going up. In addition to that, Costco notes on its site that they use their Costco approach in order to help fuel demand here, just as the same as the inside of the warehouse. High volume and low prices are the way to go here at these Costco gasoline locations. To note here, there are 640 gas stations in North America Costco locations. So the major retailer did see that jump of 159.6% in foot traffic during the week of March 7. But this is not directly translating to investors on Wall Street. Year-to-date, it's down about 1.4%. But worth noting, compared to a year ago, it's up 59%. And so it's certainly a trend to keep watching as these memberships drive people to Costco, and also these customers are more inclined to get their gas at Costco and perhaps lead to other trips while they're there. That one stop shop really benefiting Costco here. - Indeed. Thank you for that update. Yahoo Finance's own Brooke DiPalma there. Thank you so much.",Business/Yahoo Finance Video,Higher gas prices are taking a toll on retail foot traffic,https://news.yahoo.com/higher-gas-prices-taking-toll-205818113.html
3/29/2022,"Russian forces now control the majority of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, CNN reported Monday. ""[W]e are in the hands of the occupiers today,"" said Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko in a televised interview on Monday. According to Reuters, Boichenko, who is no longer in the city, also said that Russia's siege of Mariupol has killed nearly 5,000 people and that 160,000 people remain trapped in the city without clean water or electricity. Mariupol had a pre-invasion population of over 400,000. Ukrainian sources have accused Russian and Russian-backed separatist troops of forcibly taking thousands of Mariupol residents to Russia and of firing on proposed evacuation corridors. Last week, Zelensky said over 4,000 people had been successfully evacuated from Mariupol. Pro-Russian separatists say they're evacuating 1,700 per day, per CNN. The New York Times reported Sunday that Mariupol was ""close to falling."" According to the Times, Zelensky told the city's remaining defenders they may need to flee and said Ukraine's military cannot muster ""a sufficient number of tanks, other armored vehicles, and ... aircraft"" to ""break the blockade in Mariupol."" Capturing Mariupol would be Russia's largest victory of the war. Having failed to quickly capture Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities as planned, Russian forces have ""narrowed immediate targets to the sieges of the southern port city of Mariupol and the strategically placed city of Chernihiv in the north,"" the Times explains. Mariupol lies on Ukraine's southern coast between the separatist-controlled Donbas region and the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014. If Mariupol falls, Russia will have successfully seized a ""land bridge"" connecting the two.
