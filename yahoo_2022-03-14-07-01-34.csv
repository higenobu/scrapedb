3/14/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Global airlines are going to great lengths to avoid Russian airspace but few to the extent of Finnair Oyj, the flag carrier of Finland. It’s flying thousands of miles around its northern neighbor, retracing routes abandoned decades ago at the end of the Cold War.

Airlines may face additional maintenance costs for heavier use of their long-haul jets and some new overflight fees from countries they may not have traversed previously. And, of course, there’s the extra time customers will spend in transit. The diversions also are blowing a big hole in airlines’ commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “The impact of these is so great, that at this stage we are unfortunately not able to offer passenger connections to all of our Asian destinations,” Perttu Jolma, vice-president of Finnair’s traffic planning team, wrote in a March 7 company blog. The Nordic carrier -- which until recently touted itself as offering the shortest routes from Europe to Asia -- scrapped its Northeast Asian flights and re-routed trips to Southeast Asia after being banished from Russian airspace.

The less-direct routings add as much as three hours on most Europe-Asia routes. Read more: Flight Routes Get Thrown Into Chaos With Russian Airspace Closed United Airlines Holdings Inc. canceled two of its four flights to India after deciding to end Russian overflights on March 1. Trips from San Francisco to Delhi and Newark, New Jersey to Mumbai wouldn’t work without re-fueling or heavily restricting the amount of cargo and passengers. That’s a deal breaker for many flights. United is routing its Newark-Delhi flights over Saudi Arabia and its Chicago-Delhi flight over Turkey, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. But the return flight to Chicago is 17 hours, two hours longer than using Russian airspace, according to data from tracking service FlightAware. One of the world’s longest flights, Qantas Airways Ltd.’s Sydney-Darwin-London service, flies through the Middle East and southern Europe instead of traversing China and Russia, adding 60 minutes to flights already pushing 17 hours long, the company said last month. All those extra miles mean more fuel burn. An Airbus SE A350-900, which Finnair uses for longer routes, consumes roughly 1,830 gallons of fuel per hour at a typical cruise speed, according to data compiled by Robert Mann, an aviation analyst in Long Island, New York. At the March 10 settlement price of $3.20 per gallon in Europe, based on Platt’s data, an extra three hours would add more than $17,000 in additional fuel expense. (The A350-900 can carry 37,248 gallons of fuel, or 141,000 liters.) Likewise, the extra 4.5 hours Japan Airlines Co. needs for its London to Tokyo routing via Canada and Alaska runs over $20,000 in extra fuel for the Boeing Co. 787-9 on the route, based on current jet fuel prices. This additional fuel use, if it persists, could further complicate airlines’ goal of achieving zero net carbon emissions by 2050, an ambitious target the International Air Transport Association adopted in October. Pricier Jet Fuel The sudden circuity following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine comes just as airlines are slammed by another aspect of the war: A spike in jet fuel prices owing to the geopolitical turbulence and the U.S. ban of Russian oil imports, announced March 8, a move the United Kingdom is likely to follow in coming months. In the past month, spot fuel prices have surged 26% to $116 per barrel of Brent crude as of Thursday. Brent crude futures price climbed as high as $139 intraday on March 7. Japan’s largest airline, All Nippon Airways Co. Ltd, is considering raising fares on rerouted flights to Europe, the Japanese newspaper Nikkei reported this week, citing an interview with the carrier’s new chief executive. The industry tumult follows two years of a pandemic that sent air travel demand to historic lows, with much international traffic still below 2019 levels. Getting around the globe in a timely and cost-effective manner has become an added conundrum. Air France has altered flight paths for five Asian destinations from Paris, including Beijing and Tokyo, to fly a southerly route over Turkey, Kazakhstan and China. The reroutes add one to two hours per flight, the carrier said. Japan Airlines Co. Ltd. is routing its Tokyo service to London using a longer northern route via Alaska and Greenland. Views of Arctic tundra are scant comfort for passengers: Flight times to London take an extra three hours, adding to an average 12-hour trip. Cold War Thaw After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, global airlines begin exploring routine flights over Russia to save time and money. Finnair started trans-Siberian service after a bilateral agreement entered into force in 1994. Before the pandemic traffic between Asia and Europe accounted for more than half of Finnair’s revenue. Higher prices for cargo shipments have helped offset some of the lost revenue, but the cuts to service have been painful. New limits on destinations and less frequent flights mean fewer workers are needed. The airline has started talks on laying off some crews temporarily, which come on top of pandemic-induced furloughs. “We now expect to furlough about 100 to 180 pilots and 150 to 380 cabin crew,” Tallqvist said.

3/14/2022,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Russia urged India to deepen its investments in the sanction-hit country's oil and gas sector, and is keen on expanding the sales networks of Russian companies in Asia's third-largest economy. Russia's economy faces its deepest crisis since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, as the West imposes severe sanctions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Some western allies have encouraged India to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine, after New Delhi abstained from voting against Moscow, a long-standing arms supplier, at the United Nations. ""Russia's oil and petroleum product exports to India have approached $1 billion, and there are clear opportunities to increase this figure,"" said Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, according to a statement shared by Russia's embassy in India late on Friday. ""We are interested in further attracting Indian investment to the Russian oil and gas sector and expanding Russian companies' sales networks in India,"" Novak told Indian Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri. The United States this week banned Russian oil imports and Britain said it will phase them out by year end, decisions expected to further disrupt the global energy market, where Russia is the second-largest exporter of crude. Indian state-run companies hold stakes in Russian oil and gas fields, while Russian entities including Rosneft own a majority stake in Indian refiner Nayara Energy. Some Indian companies also buy Russian oil. Russia expects both countries to continue cooperation on civilian nuclear power, including building new units at a nuclear power plant in the south Indian town of Kudankulam, Novak said.

3/14/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: Russia Asking China for Military Aid, U.S. Says Ukraine Update: Russia Strikes Military Center Closer to Poland U.S. Journalist Killed in Ukraine in Shooting Near Kyiv Russian Official Warns Finland, Sweden Against Joining NATO Marcos Nears Bottom in Philippine Markets Poll Favoring Robredo The global food system is under threat as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine puts one of the world’s major breadbaskets in jeopardy. Here are the latest developments and their far-reaching impacts: Food Inflation The Ukraine war threatens staple crops from Europe’s key grain-growing regions, which means escalating food prices that have already been plaguing consumers around the world could get worse, raising the threat of a full-blown hunger crisis. The United Nations warned that already record global food costs could surge another 22% as war stifles trade and slashes future harvests. Grains are the staples that feed the world, with wheat, corn and rice accounting for more than 40% of all calories consumed. Higher shipping costs, energy inflation, extreme weather and labor shortages have made it harder to produce food. And supply is shrinking: grain stockpiles are poised for a fifth straight annual decline, according to the International Grains Council. The war in Ukraine stands to only push prices up further, sending hunger to unprecedented levels. Global food prices are at all-time highs, with a benchmark UN index soaring more than 40% over the past two years. Food insecurity has doubled in that period, and 45 million people are estimated to be on the brink of famine. Agricultural markets are also soaring. Wheat hit an all-time record in Chicago on Tuesday. Corn and soybeans are trading near multiyear highs. Food Protectionism Governments are taking steps to keep food supplies closer to home, a move likely to prolong food inflation. Hungary, Indonesia and Argentina are among a cluster of countries that have imposed trade barriers on agricultural exports ranging from wheat to cooking oil in an attempt to suppress domestic prices and safeguard local food supplies after Russia’s invasion led to widespread panic about shortages. Russia added to this spate of protectionism when it signaled plans to restrict trade of some raw materials. A major Ukraine food exporter, MHP SE, pivoted to supplying the Ukrainian army and civilians in bombed-out cities. Trade restrictions could cause international prices to rise even higher due to tightening global supplies, according to Steve Mathews, head of strategy at Gro Intelligence. “It adds greatly to the inflationary concerns,” he said. Other global suppliers may take strides to fill stockpile shortfalls. India, for example, has increased wheat shipments in recent years and could boost exports to a record 7 million tons if the conflict drags on. But many nations that could typically offset shortages are themselves facing production problems. In Brazil, a major supplier of corn and soybeans, crippling drought has parched crops. Dry weather also wilted fields in Canada and parts of the U.S. last year. North American farmers could see current prices as a reason to plant more in the coming weeks, but it will be months before those acres get harvested. Farm Inputs Everything that goes into growing food is getting pricier. Russia, a big supplier of every major type of crop nutrient, urged domestic fertilizer producers to cut exports earlier this month, stoking fears of shortages of crop inputs that are vital to growers. Russia’s move adds uncertainty to the global market when farmers in Brazil—the world’s largest fertilizer importer—are already having trouble getting nutrients for crops. Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country will supply fertilizers to nations that have “friendly relations” with Russia, though it first needs to guarantee fertilizer supplies for the domestic market. Fertilizer prices have been soaring worldwide amid supply snags and production woes. In Europe, soaring prices for natural gas—a key input for the production of nitrogen fertilizers—has already forced some facilities to curtail production. The price of fuel, used by farmers to heat barns and run equipment used to produce food, is also skyrocketing. Adding to the stress are sanctions against Russia, a major energy supplier to the world, with the U.S. and U.K. moving to ban imports of Russian crude and other oil products. “In the current high-priced environment, farmers will face difficulties paying for and/or acquiring the credit they need to purchase inputs,” Alexis Maxwell, an analyst for Bloomberg's Green Markets, said. “Any scarcity risks curbing grain yields and quality, adding pressure to crop prices.” Black Sea Supplies Ships carrying grain appear to be moving again out of the Azov Sea, the waterway that’s straddled by Russia and Ukraine and connected to the Black Sea. Russia’s attack had initially thrown the world’s wheat and vegetable oil supplies into chaos as vessel traffic came to a halt in the region. The Black Sea is also an exporting market for major fertilizers. Still, fears of crew safety and insurance premiums are discouraging ship owners from sending ships to Ukraine or Russia, and flight bans have made it difficult for Russian seafarers to get to their ships or to return home. Ukraine and Russia together account for more than a quarter of the global trade in wheat, as well as a fifth of corn sales. Buying Frenzy Contending with the dizzying rally in agricultural markets is no easy task, particularly for countries reliant on foreign supply. Shockwaves are spreading to store shelves, with worries of surging sunflower oil prices triggering heavy buying in Turkey. Even Indonesia, the world’s biggest exporter of edible oils, is feeling the strain: Supermarkets have restricted cooking oil purchases to one pack per shopper and families are bringing their young children to line up so they can buy more. Worries over food supplies are also growing in the world’s two most populous nations—China and India. Chinese buyers are scooping up U.S. corn and soybeans to secure supplies as Beijing ramps up its emphasis on food security. In India, the blistering rally of vegetable oil is turning away buyers in a sign of demand destruction that some banks and analysts have warned about. The nation is the biggest importer of edible oils and consumers are extremely sensitive to prices. If grain supplies from the Black Sea remain cut off, it would require even more significant rerouting of global agricultural trade, Gro Intelligence’s Mathews said. “That realignment will be painful, and the pain will be distributed in order of how much your food budget is relative to your overall income or wealth,” he said.
