3/25/2022,"In an unassuming home in Hollywood, cardboard boxes and black suitcases wait in the front hall. “Congratulations, Benedict Cumberbatch” reads a laminated card on top of a suitcase. A similar one for Judi Dench sits atop a box, ready for shipping to the UK. All around the house, luxury products – moisturisers, sunglasses – are cluttered on tables. The place has the feel of Santa’s grotto on Christmas Eve. This is the home of the fabulously named Lash Fary, the Father Christmas behind the annual unofficial Oscars gift bag, which is officially the biggest gift bag the nominees receive. Gift bags, actually: there are enough items to fill a large suitcase and carrier bag, and they get sent to what Fary describes as “the top nominees” – : best actor, best actress, best director, best supportings. The bags are so heavy that some nominees who live outside America ask for them to be shipped home. But that privilege is only granted to the elite of the elite: “So Olivia Colman and Judi Dench, really,” says Fary. This year’s bag is worth $140,000 and items include $10,000 worth of Botox (“I don’t know a single woman who doesn’t have Botox,” says Fary, and I believe him), a $15,000 holiday at a Californian spa and $25,000 worth of home construction. “People here are always doing renovations on their fifth house,” Fary says. There is also a $50,000 three-night stay in a Scottish castle, which Fary included for the British nominees because he thought it would be more convenient than “a trip to the Galápagos or whatever”. The Oscars are ostensibly about movies; but they are also about product placement. For fashion designers, this means getting celebrities to wear their clothes on the red carpet. For other luxury companies, it means getting the celebrities to use their products in the hope they’ll be photographed with them or post them on social media. This can happen through one of two ways: gift bags or gift lounges, and both are operating at fever pitch this year to ensure some of the most privileged people in the world are lavished with further privileges. The gift bags are sent directly to the celebrities. The gift lounges, which have been a feature of the big award events since the 90s, are rooms filled with products where the nominees can do a supermarket sweep. At GBK lounge, which this year teamed up with eBay, nominees can pick up Tag Heuer watches and Saint Laurent bags. At the Secret Room events lounge, celebrities can get some Botox and claim a trip to Tahiti. In a hotel off Sunset Boulevard, the so-called “queen of the gift lounge” Nathalie Dubois is setting up a pop-up spa alongside the seven other suites she has filled with products, ranging from handbags to trips to Bali and Kenya. “These are not things they will give to their maids, I assure you,” she says. There is a some friction between those overseeing the gift bags and the gift lounges: “I would bet my life Nicole Kidman would not go to a gift suite,” sniffs Fary. Dubois is equally dismissive: “I’m against gift bags because you don’t know if the celebrity uses them. Here, we see them and they photograph themselves with the products, which is so important.” This is the real point. “The products are free but strings are attached: the brands hope the celebrities will Instagram or tweet about them, and the celebrities know that,” says Fary. One year, Amy Adams was photographed in a T-shirt from Fary’s gift bag. Sharon Stone has been photographed wearing jewellery she picked up from Dubois. But why give so much to people who already have so much? “It’s the same reason as Jennifer Lawrence gets paid $20m for a movie: their names have value and they can transform the landscape of a brand,” says Fary. Not all celebrities are keen on free stuff. This year Denzel Washington declined the gift bag so Fary sent it to Sian Heder, the director of Coda, who he thought should have been nominated. In the past Glenn Close donated hers to a women’s charity. “People say, ‘Why not donate the money spent on the gift bags to Ukraine?’ But I haven’t spent any money. The products are donated,” says Fary. As for Dubois, half of one of her suites is decorated with the Ukraine flag. Here, celebrities can record messages for the Ukrainian people and make charitable donations. “I was doing a gift suite at the Césars when the invasion happened and I thought, ‘I can’t do a bling-bling suite when there are refugees.’ It just felt wrong. But I couldn’t cancel, because I have clients. So this is what I did,” she says. And then rushes off to prepare the spa.",Arts/Film,Gift bag v freebie lounge: backstage rivalry sums up the Oscars’ opulence,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/25/gift-bag-freebie-lounge-rivalry-oscars
3/25/2022,"The organiser of next week’s televised Concert for Ukraine has described the event as “comparable to Live Aid”. “The scale is obviously different – Live Aid was transatlantic,” said Guy Freeman, MD of the production company Livewire Pictures. “But it is comparable in terms of people coming together very quickly in the face of an emergency.” The event, being broadcast live by ITV and STV on Tuesday, will feature Ed Sheeran, Nile Rodgers & Chic, Camila Cabello, Manic Street Preachers, Snow Patrol, Emeli Sandé and more, and was mobilised in just two weeks after Freeman was horrified by the “relentless” news and wanted to help. He first contacted ITV before approaching venues. “NEC Group were amazing. They said: ‘We’ve got space at these times at [Birmingham’s] Resorts World Arena.’” Three booking agents volunteered to start contacting touring acts who were able to perform at such short notice. Tom Odell, who has had four UK top five albums since his chart-topping debut Long Way Down in 2013, is one of them. “I’ve played in Kyiv a bunch of times so when I saw the first bombs being dropped it was heartbreaking,” he said. “I said yes [to performing] immediately.” Freeman said: “Obviously I’m mindful that the industry is just getting back on its feet after Covid so it’s a tricky time to be asking people to interrupt a tour, but such is the strength of feeling that people just went: I’m in.” When Odell was called, he had just performed at a charity concert for Ukraine in Bucharest; he had seen Ukrainian refugees getting help at the train station and wanted to do more. The Concert for Ukraine organisers and performers alike are giving their services for free, as is a vast infrastructure network including staging and sound crew. “The number of companies helping is amazing,” said Freeman. “I’ve never known anything like it. Some of the British acts were in the US, so British Airways offered us free flights to bring them back. Others have provided everything from hotel rooms to trains.” Katie Rawcliffe, ITV’s head of entertainment, said that the broadcaster instantly said yes because “it was just the right thing to do. Normally, casting and budgeting for this sort of thing can take months, but we were ready to press go within 24 hours.” ITV is donating all its advertising revenue – around £3m – from the 8pm-10pm broadcast, and the vast majority of the £52 ticket price is also going to Ukraine (with the government waiving the VAT). “It’s a big logistical operation,” said Rawcliffe, “but there’s been so much goodwill. It does feel like Live Aid in the respect that once people started to get onboard the whole thing snowballed.” Other artists on the bill include Gregory Porter, Becky Hill and the Kingdom Choir, with more names being added this weekend. “It’s amazing how the public are getting galvanised too,” Rawcliffe continued. “I’ve been talking as a mum to other mums about what they are doing in their area, and what is happening in local schools. I’ve never known anything like it.” Numerous other concerts have been staged to benefit Ukraine, including one in New Orleans by Canadian alt-rockers Arcade Fire earlier this month, and another in New York featuring the cream of the American avant garde such as Laurie Anderson and John Zorn. Record labels including Ninja Tune and Sub Pop, and artists such as Belle and Sebastian, have donated proceeds from the sale of music, and Massive Attack’s Robert Del Naja has raised money via limited edition art prints. During a rooftop performance in Los Angeles on 17 March, Duran Duran played Ordinary World with the colours of the Ukrainian flag projected on to the nearby Capitol Records building. On 3 April, the London Philharmonic Orchestra will perform at Glyndebourne with various opera singers to benefit the Disasters Emergency Committee’s (DEC) Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal, which funds charities including British Red Cross, Oxfam and Save the Children. Proceeds from ITV’s Concert for Ukraine will also go to the DEC appeal. “This is the second biggest appeal in our history, second only to the Boxing Day tsunami appeal in 2004,” said DEC’s chief executive, Saleh Saeed. “The outpouring of support, from the public to artists to corporates, is just phenomenal.” DEC hopes Concert for Ukraine will considerably bolster donations, which have already reached £200m and are funnelled towards shelter, sanitation and medical care. “The UN is estimating that 10 million people are being displaced [from] their homes, most just taking what they can carry,” said Saeed. “This appeal is so important to keep supply lines going and keep people protected. There are children who were playing games a month ago and now need urgent counselling. People will be suffering and will need assistance for years to come, and it’s important that we help rebuild people’s lives. We’re extremely grateful to everyone involved in the concert.” Every artist at the Concert for Ukraine will perform one or two songs, each chosen for their supportive messaging. Odell said: “I will be trying my hardest to keep the audience entertained, but the most important thing is that we raise lots of money and keep the conversation [going] on the conflict.”  Concert for Ukraine broadcasts live on ITV and STV from 8pm on Tuesday 29 March.

3/25/2022,"If there was any doubt that Roe v Wade has been nullified, Idaho’s governor, Brad Little, put an end to it on Wednesday, when he signed SB1309, known officially as the Fetal Heartbeat Preborn Child Protection Act, into law. Like Texas’ SB8, Idaho’s new law bans all abortions after six weeks’ gestational age, in plain violation of Roe. But like SB8, the law may well be able to go into effect as scheduled next month, because it is enforced not through state action, but through private lawsuits. The supreme court is likely to overturn Roe this summer anyway, in the widely anticipated Dobbs v Jackson ruling. But almost all abortions have been illegal in Texas since September, when the court gave its blessing to SB8’s private enforcement provision and allowed the law to go into effect. Since the court gave the nod to SB8, other Republican-controlled states have rushed to pass copycat bills, eager to outlaw abortion within their borders even before the downfall of Roe in a few months. According to the reproductive rights research group the Guttmacher Institute, SB8 copycat bills have been introduced in 12 states, including Alabama, Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma and Tennessee. But Idaho’s is the first to be signed into law. The substantive impact of Idaho’s SB1309 will be much the same as that of SB8: abortion clinics will close under threat of liability, and women in the state will be subjected to the material harm and moral indignity of not being able to make decisions about their own bodies, or personal decisions about the course of their own lives. Abortion providers will leave, or change their practice; clinics in neighboring, Democratic-controlled states, like Washington and Oregon, will see an influx of patients, reproductive refugees seeking in a different territory the treatment they’re denied in their own. Local abortion funds will drain their coffers helping patients buy tickets for buses and planes out of state – that is, unless they get sued out of existence, too. But SB1309 also differs from SB8 in several crucial ways, and those differences may highlight how the anti-choice right may govern in the post-Roe future. Unlike SB8, SB1309 allows an exemption for pregnancies caused by rape or incest – so long as those assaults were reported, that is, which fewer than one-third of such incidents are, according to Rainn. The Idaho law has a bigger minimum reward for plaintiffs than the Texas law does: the private citizens who sue abortion providers in Texas will collect at least $10,000 if they win, but in Idaho, the prize is $20,000. And crucially, the Idaho law limits the range of potential plaintiffs. In Texas, any citizen – including those residing out of state – can sue over any abortion performed in Texas after six weeks. But in Idaho, in order to sue over an abortion, a plaintiff needs to be a family member of the woman who had the abortion, the man who fathered her pregnancy, or a family member of that man. Reported rapists are excluded from the right to sue, but their family members are not. To pro-choice Americans, this smaller pool of potential litigants in the Idaho law might sound like good news. Fewer people with a right to sue over abortions means that patients and their medical providers have fewer enemies to worry about, fewer nefarious actors to look over their shoulders for. In Texas, denying women the right to choose has become everyone’s prerogative, subsuming the issue of abortion into a state of generalized surveillance and vigilantism. Idaho isn’t like that. In Idaho, denying women the right to choose is a private, family matter. But the keep-it-in-the-family approach of Idaho’s SB1309 has its own sinister and insidious logic. By granting a patient’s parents, siblings, partners and in-laws the right to sue over her choices regarding her own body and life, the law implies that these parties have a particular interest in, or perhaps even ownership over, that woman. The logic is that women are the possessions of their families, and that those families – namely, their fathers and husbands, though the Idaho law extends to female relatives as well – have an interest, even a right, to control them. SB1309’s private cause of action is targeted, granting these relatives the right to sue providers only over abortion. But the notion that the parents, husbands, and in-laws of adult women have a legitimate legal claim to control those women’s bodies and lives is one that could be expanded even beyond the question of reproductive choice. As heinous as the abortion ban is, it may not stop there. SB1309’s conception of women as family possessions harkens back to ancient idea of women as the property of their fathers – property that could be transferred to other men in a transaction known as marriage. It is interesting that SB1309 also names fathers and their family members as having an interest in the woman’s choices, implying that the right to control her and her body can be extended by inseminating her. If this all sounds baroque and morbid, like something out of the Old Testament, that’s because it is: the Idaho bill was lobbied for by a group that calls itself the Idaho Family Policy Center, a non-profit dedicated to “promoting Biblically sound public policy”. In this way, Idaho and Texas seem somewhat at odds over what the justifying logic behind the abortion bans of the post-Roe future should be. Are women’s bodies public property, like Texas says, subject to regulation by anyone and everyone? Or are they private property, like in Idaho, subject to the more intimate terrorizing control of husbands, fathers, brothers and in-laws? It’s not clear which vision will prevail. We can only wait for the next Republican-controlled state legislature to weigh in. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist",Opinion/Opinion,"Are women's bodies private property?

3/25/2022,"For months many of us have used a single red line in a plastic cartridge as a kind of social traffic light – swaying whether go out or stay at home to protect others from Covid. But from 1 April, lateral flow tests (LFTs) will cease to be free of charge in England and Scotland, meaning people will want to use them as economically as possible (if they bother testing at all). Wales and Northern Ireland are implementing a phased approach to charging for tests from the same date. So, when is the optimal time to test if LFTs are limited and you want the greatest chance of knowing if you’re infected? Doing an LFT immediately before visiting a vulnerable person helps to reduce the risk of transmission, but doesn’t entirely negate it. This is because LFTs only produce a second red line (a positive result) above a certain threshold of virus. “You can be infectious without noticing symptoms, or before symptoms develop, and lateral flow tests may miss this,” said Prof Ajit Lalvani, chair of infectious diseases at Imperial College London. In a recent study published in The BMJ, Lalvani and colleagues found that LFTs would miss 20% of positive cases, when used to screen symptomatic people at an NHS Test and Trace centre, or 29% of cases in city-wide mass testing of asymptomatic people. Using LFTs as a green light for visiting those at greatest risk of severe Covid could therefore provide false reassurance – although it is better than not testing at all. To further reduce risks, Lalvani advises ensuring that both parties are fully vaccinated; limiting unnecessary social exposure in the five days before the visit; washing hands immediately before the visit; wearing a face mask and maintaining social distancing; and meeting outside or in a well-ventilated room. According to users of the Zoe Covid app, the most common symptoms associated with the Omicron variant closely match those of common colds or influenza: a runny nose, headaches, fatigue, sneezing and a sore throat. Although a positive LFT can confirm such symptoms are due to Covid, virus levels may not be high enough during the first few days to give a positive result. This could be a particular issue in people who have been well-vaccinated, because symptoms are often caused by the immune response to the virus, and these responses may kick in faster if you’ve been vaccinated or previously had Covid. This means you may be borderline infectious during the first few days of symptoms – but still testing negative on an LFT. “The problem is that once the virus starts to replicate it goes really, really fast – so, you may have symptoms in the morning and not be infectious, but by midday you may be infectious,” said Irene Petersen, a professor of epidemiology and health informatics at University College London. She recommends staying at home if you have any symptoms, and if LFTs are limited, “don’t waste your test at the beginning – keep it until day two or three”. Staying at home is particularly advisable if you’ve developed symptoms after being in contact with a known Covid case, or local infection numbers are high. If you must leave the house, wear an FFP2 mask, keep your distance from other people, conduct meetings outside where possible, and regularly wash your hands. Although there is no longer any legal requirement to self-isolate if you’ve been in close contact with an infected person, the government still advises you to work from home where possible; avoid contact with vulnerable individuals; limit close contact with other people, especially in crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces; and to wear a mask in these situations. “After contact with a confirmed Covid case, there is a risk of contracting (and then transmitting) the infection for up to 10 days after the contact,” Lalvani said. Testing may be advisable in some circumstances, but doing so in the first few days after exposure is likely to be a waste of time (and tests), because it takes time for the virus to produce enough copies of itself to become detectable. According to a recent challenge trial, which involved deliberately infecting 36 young healthy people with the original strain of coronavirus, the average time from first exposure to early symptoms was 42 hours, with virus levels peaking at around five days after exposure, and remaining high for a further four days, on average. If you never develop symptoms, it’s impossible to know if you’ve escaped infection without testing, so should you use your last remaining LFTs during those five to 10 days after exposure? “If you do not develop symptoms, then a possible reason for using LFTs after contact would be if you plan to visit a vulnerable person within 10 days of the contact,” said Lalvani. Health or care workers should follow the testing guidelines of their hospital, clinic or care organisation, he added. According to current NHS guidance, if you have Covid you should stay at home for up to 10 days from when your symptoms start (day zero), but if you get a negative LFT on days six and seven, and don’t have a fever, you can go back to business as normal. If you have two consecutive negative LFTs, you can be highly confident that you are no longer infectious – so testing at this point is advisable, if you feel well enough to leave the house. If you continue to test positive after day seven, the picture is less clear. “Often the LFTs continue to test positive even though the person is no longer infectious, but there is no better easily available test to determine the end of infectiousness,” said Lalvani. “Most adults are no longer infectious 10 days after the onset of symptoms, regardless of their LFT results. However, some people, particularly those with health conditions that severely impair their immune systems, may remain infectious for longer.”",News/World news,When should lateral flow tests be used in England now they must be paid for?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/covid-when-should-lateral-flow-tests-be-used-england-now-kits-no-longer-free-
3/25/2022,"Scientists must long to travel back two years and revisit their Covid predictions. So too must commentators who relied on them. That March of 2020 was a nightmare month for the great game of prediction. Boris Johnson’s press conference on 3 March was a cautious occasion. He had just received wild reports from Whitehall’s scaremongers declaring that 80% of the nation “could be” about to suffer from a killer disease from which half a million “could die”. His response was to take comfort from his in-house scientists, guided down the path to “herd immunity” by his senior advisers, including Patrick Vallance. Daily briefings and hysteria mounted until 23 March, when Johnson performed the agony of volte-face. His capitulation to extreme lockdown was so abject as to make it hard for anyone who had followed his argument so far to agree with him. Most commentators cynically switched sides and said he should have capitulated sooner. My thinking was that we had been through this crying-wolf routine so often in the past, including from the modellers of Imperial College and perhaps their lobbyist friends in big pharma. Back in 1997 we had heard that millions “might die” from bird flu, and from Sars in 2003, and from swine flu in 2009. The scientists extracted vast sums from the government, including £560m on bird flu and swine flu vaccines that just sat unused in a warehouse. Imperial College was now terrifying Johnson with its much favoured “worst-case scenario” of half a million deaths if he refused total lockdown, irrespective of cost. A reasonable person might have reacted as I did. There was nothing to suggest that this epidemic was not another of the same. The wolves of big science were after headlines and money, and should be taken with a pinch of salt. Surely, I wrote, “come the spring, the crisis will have passed” – and spring was just a fortnight away. As the month progressed, though, Covid was clearly gripping the globe, from Asia to Italy, Spain, Germany and Poland. By early April the country was in deep lockdown and Covid was sufficiently virulent for me to admit: “I was wrong, or think I was.” Clearly this was not another Sars. But I stuck to my belief that it would end soon. I was comforted by the policy adopted by Sweden’s health chief, Anders Tegnell, who was rejecting lockdown, pursuing voluntary social distancing and relying on herd immunity rather than the draconian test-trace-and-isolate of regimes in China and Taiwan. As summer progressed, we assumed Covid was all over and that we would learn which responses were most effective. We learned nothing. Stringent lockdowns in China, Italy, New Zealand, Denmark and Britain had delivered both the highest and the lowest deaths per million. Tight test-and-trace had worked in South Korea, but so had its absence in Sweden. The latter suffered a bad outbreak in its care homes but still fared better overall than the UK and Spain Such comparison was wiped from the table by two dramatic events at the end of 2020. One was the emergence of a virulent second wave of Covid – and then a third. The other was the development and speedy production of vaccines. The gods of test-and-trace were toppled overnight by those of jab and booster. The unpredicted nature of both events dissolved much argument. Vaccination changed the terms of the debate. In Britain, it got Johnson off his volte-face hook. From spring 2021, Covid pessimism gave way to optimism in what was one of the great coups for modern science. But to those struggling to follow the argument, vaccination had a masking effect. If vaccination was so successful, why still lockdown? Should lockdown go the way of test-and-trace, a hoary old cure to be consigned to the museum? And what of mutations such as Omicron? Were they to be handled through vaccines and medicines, like flu, or to be treated as yet another evolving pandemic, to be met with the full force of resumed lockdown? The simple conclusion from the past two years is that it is still too early to say. We must await the mother of all public inquiries. The trouble is that the emerging statistics may offer little guidance. The government’s chief statistician, Ed Humpherson, recently told MPs to treat excess deaths as the most robust measure of the international comparison. They represented the ultimate impact of the pandemic on a nation’s health and longevity. But here we encounter yet more fog. The US Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation reports extraordinary similarities between the impacts of Covid on, for instance, the UK, France and Germany. They had differing lockdown practices but near-identical excess death rates, roughly halfway down the global league table. Some of the lowest rates were in locked-down Finland but also in unlocked-down Sweden, which was half Britain’s rate. This suggests that the argument is by no means over. It may yet be that Covid deaths had less to do with lockdown and more with the overall efficiency of health services in confronting serious cases and in dealing with other deaths at the same time. The evidence may suggest that what was critical was the behaviour of different economic and social cultures in responding to lockdown. Sweden’s GDP declined in that critical year of 2020 by just 2.9%. Britain crippled itself with a decline of 9.4%. Is that perhaps why more Britons died? But this brings me uncomfortably close to wondering if I should have stuck to my original guns.

3/25/2022,"More survivors of rape and modern-day slavery in England and Wales will be able to give video evidence pre-recorded outside a live trial in a step ministers hope will boost confidence in the criminal justice system. Under the measure known as section 28, survivors can apply to the court to be cross-examined in front of a limited number of people, to reduce the stress of giving evidence. It will then be played during the live trial, removing the need for them to attend in person. On Friday, the government announced that the provision, already available in a limited number of crown courts, would be expanded to north-east England with the intention of introducing it countrywide as soon as practicable. Dame Vera Baird QC, the victims’ commissioner for England and Wales, said: “The rollout of section 28 to more courts is a positive move that will help to reduce unnecessary stress and trauma for more victims, and I’m pleased to see this work gather momentum.” The failure to secure more convictions in rape cases has led to accusations that the offence has effectively been decriminalised. Office for National Statistics figures published in January showed that in the 12 months to September 2021, only 1.3% of the 63,136 rape offences recorded by police resulted in a suspect being charged. The section 28 provision is already available at Liverpool, Leeds, Kingston upon Thames, Harrow, Isleworth, Wood Green and Durham crown courts. The government said it would be extended to York, Grimsby, Hull, Bradford and Teesside in the coming weeks. It said that in 2021, more than 1,800 witnesses used the provision to pre-record their evidence in front of defence and prosecution lawyers, the judge and defendant. Fay Maxted OBE, the chief executive of the Survivors Trust, said: “The wider rollout of section 28 pre-recorded evidence will make such a difference for rape victims, who often tell us that giving evidence in court feels like re-traumatisation instead of the chance to say what happened to them.” The extended use of section 28 was announced as local criminal justice scorecards were published for the first time, including information on the time taken for cases to be investigated by the police, for someone to be charged and for the case to be completed at court, and on victim engagement. The government also announced that support services for victims of crime would be boosted by more than £440m over the next three years, in a change from the current model, where funding is confirmed annually.",News/Law,More rape survivors to be able to pre-record evidence in England and Wales,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/25/pre-recorded-evidence-rape-modern-day-slavery-england-and-wales

To us, mannerism sounds like something bad – affected, pretentious … mannered. In later Renaissance Italy, however, maniera was meant as praise: an artist with a manner was one who had a distinctive, unique take on things. But here, Bronzino quotes the manners of his heroes. The boy Jesus and John the Baptist are consciously Michelangelesque, almost like sculptures in paint. Yet the idea of putting them together like this comes from Leonardo’s Virgin of the Rocks. The sad face of Saint Elizabeth, mother of John the Baptist, looks like Leonardo’s St Anne in the National Gallery’s Burlington Cartoon. Bronzino mixes up the manners in a painting that may be more about the religion of art than the worship of God. National Gallery, London To follow us on Twitter: @GdnArtandDesign.

3/25/2022,"Late morning, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe gave an interview, jointly with her husband, Richard, to the BBC. He expressed gratitude to the foreign secretary; she did not. “How many foreign secretaries does it take to bring someone home?” she said, feelingly. My friend and I spent the rest of the day wondering how long our marriages would last if we got home after six years to find our husbands expressing gratitude to Liz Truss. My opening bid was that we’d be separated by that evening, though the divorce might take a while to come through. My friend pointed out that Nazanin is obviously much more mature than us, as she prefaced her disagreement with an explicit statement of love and respect (for Richard, not Truss), the kind of move that a marriage counsellor might invite you to try, but only a really decent person could credibly pull off. She unleashed the beasts, predictably if unfortunately. One guy spoke for the worst of the nation when he called an LBC phone-in to say, “it would have been nice of Nazanin to say thank you”. He went on to suggest that all proceeds from anything she writes (or does?) from now on should go to charity. It was said in ire, one assumes, but had an underlying logic – people mistook the British debt to Iran, finally paid to secure this release, for a ransom. By this (ir)rationale, Zaghari-Ratcliffe had actually cost the taxpayer £400m, rather than been the victim of a shameful bit of government contract-breaking going back to 1979. Arron Banks speculated aloud that she probably had been politically active in Iran, after all. The hashtag #sendherback started trending on Twitter. The counter-hashtag #WelcomeHomeNazanin was born. Just another ordinary start to the week, then, on Horribly Divided Island. But how immensely weird it must be for Nazanin. She went off to visit her parents, spent six years in prison for a crime she didn’t commit, finally made it home, only to find her previously normal nation had lost its marbles and was now engaged full-time in a culture war, of which she’s the new poster-person. Welcome home, Nazanin; sorry we didn’t take better care of the place. I have thumped on about blood donation before; I swear I am not bragging. It is a perfectly normal act of civic duty of which I am not unduly proud. Nope, in private, though, I am immensely proud of my type-O blood, the best kind, since anyone can use it. When you’re marked for a type O, everyone smiles at you and repeatedly tells you how important you are, and you get a special keyring saying “first responder”. I’ve never attached it to my keys, because I’m not sure what it entails – if I were walking past an accident, would I be expected to respond there and then? – but I flex incessantly at home, to my husband, who has some inferior blood type such as AB. To get today’s appointment, because I’ve travelled to Mexico this year, it had to be established whether or not I might have contracted the Zika virus, via a number of questions such as: did I have sex while I was there? Well, not with anyone new, I said, and the lady laughed and said “hopefully him neither”, and this, filtered through my energetic ego, became “the blood donation lady said that if an AB blood person transmits Zika to an O, that’s essentially treason against the NHS.” Then I said that the reason my appointment was at 9am was in case they needed to use my precious blood that very day. Sadly I used up all my headroom with this bullshit, got my appointment time wrong, missed it by an hour, had to rebook. You can look forward to more dispatches from the blood aristocracy some time soon. It was the spring statement and Rishi Sunak hadn’t made many friends in the run-up. He’d been heard in some Commons bar bragging about his new second (third? fourth?) home in California, and MPs, who – even the best of them – have a near infinite tolerance for other people’s wealth, finally started griping about him. It cracks open a lot about the British character, as well as its political culture, when the chancellor has a personal fortune into nine figures. By and large it is considered impolite to mention it. There’s a weird code of conduct, a disparity switcheroo, and the rules are these: if a regular MP on an MP’s salary puts a KitKat on his expenses, that is a fine thing to explode about. Rail against him, write comedy sketches about his confectionary needs, fill your boots. If, on the other hand, an MP votes to reduce disability entitlements, housing benefit, axes the universal credit uplift, votes against free school meals in the holidays, when he personally, never mind with policy, could stop the nation’s children going hungry (maybe with a little help from his even richer wife), everyone just stares at their metaphorical shoes. Honourable exception, here, to Sunak’s local pub, which barred him after the free school meals vote. Where did this peculiar courtesy and discretion come from? Do we have an exaggerated respect for wealth? A sense that any potshot might be a little too easy? Nobody knows, but this week the inexplicable omertà exploded. We just could not stomach one more mouthful of a chancellor whose measures made the poor poorer, at a time of such desperate straits, when he is so stratospherically far from understanding what that might feel like. Suddenly, everything he did was ridiculous. His Marie Antoinette moment came when he tried to sound relatable while also dodging a question about how inflation was affecting him personally. It was hard for him to say how much groceries had gone up by. In his house, he said, they ate all different kinds of bread. Absurd. He borrowed someone else’s Kia for a photo op of filling up a tank. Nice try, sunshine, but you’d be better off borrowing someone else’s Keir. All the mysterious rules of Sunak were turned on their head to land us back in reality: his fiscal measures will never make sense, because he will never know how to take the most serious questions seriously. They called it the most unlikely pairing in fashion history, though that can’t be true, because when fashion does something truly unusual, they don’t say “pair”, they say “team” (“nice cardigan, have you tried teaming it with a belt made of the teeth of sheep?”). Birkenstock, purveyor of the sandals so comfy, durable and completely unchanging that you only ever need one pair until you lose them, has partnered with Manolo Blahnik, designer of shoes that are vertiginous, fragile and in a constant state of flux – no sooner have you bought some than you need some new, totally different (but actually quite similar) ones for the new season. The result is more Birk than Blah, a familiar sandal shape in a jazzy colour with a diamanté clasp. Yet I wonder whether this is not really about the shoe but an attempt to draw the Long 90s finally to a close. The logical endpoint of the age of irony came when shoes were no longer made for walking. It was part of a postmodern package when history had also ended, ideology was over and debt was a construct that only little people worried about. Reality has bitten in the most painful ways, but at least your feet no longer have to hurt. “In Russia, television is made for people who for one reason or another are too lazy to use alternative sources of information,” said Dmitry Likin, the art director of the state-controlled Channel One, as he quit. It wasn’t as dramatic as Marina Ovsyannikova’s resignation live on air, but it’s part of a steady stream of news creators simply refusing to collude with Vladimir Putin’s propaganda. Another correspondent, Zhanna Agalakova, gave this bleak analysis as she resigned earlier in March: “Many thinking people are sensing their own guilt. And there is no exit, you understand? Simply asking for forgiveness is not enough.” This has been an ongoing theme of the war in Ukraine, that the wall of disinformation coming out of the Russian state apparatus has split families apart. Those who consume Putin’s news simply cannot believe their nation is the aggressor, even if they have a cousin calling them from an apartment as it’s being shelled. Likin may be right to cite laziness, but there is much more going on, a long-term corrosion of critical thinking. Fake news makes all other news impossible, it poisons the ecosystem, so the more you believe it, the more you have to rely on it. Unlike his military apparatus, Putin’s media ramparts have been extremely well maintained. But much like the army, its foot soldiers are losing morale.",News/UK news,"Digested week: welcome home, Nazanin, to a nation that’s lost its marbles | Zoe Williams",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/25/digested-week-welcome-home-nazanin-to-a-nation-thats-lost-its-marbles
3/25/2022,"Ukrainian refugees seeking sanctuary in the UK face being separated from their much-loved pets because of complex rules about bringing them into the country. It is estimated that over half of the more than 2.5 million Ukrainian refugees who have fled their country have brought pets with them, according to the pet travel specialists PBS Pet Travel. There are fears that some pets may have to be put down if arrangements cannot be made for owners to travel with them to countries such as the UK. While the government is expediting the process of getting Ukrainian refugees’ pets to the UK and paying for vaccination, quarantining and microchipping for them, the pets could still spend up to four months in quarantine facilities. As a result of the war, many Ukrainians are struggling to obtain the blood tests they need for pets who have had anti-rabies jabs, in order to prove that they have developed rabies antibodies, since laboratories are either closed or not processing animal blood tests. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said on Friday he had arranged to take in a family of Ukrainian refugees: a six-year-old boy, his mother, grandmother – and the family dog, Max. He will also support them with the dog’s vaccination status, as the family left the necessary documentation behind when fleeing Ukraine. Yevheniia Soldatenko and her nine-year-old son, Yaroslav, found a UK sponsor through their shared love and ownership of miniature schnauzer dogs. Jackie Thom was put in touch with the pair via a Ukrainian Facebook group for miniature schnauzer dog owners and agreed to sponsor them. “Me, my nine-year-old son and our miniature schnauzer covered more than 2,500km in three days,” said Soldatenko. “We drove through Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and came to Poland. Now we are located in Szczecin and volunteers helped us find accommodation. The people in Poland are great and they provide a lot of support. “On 18 March, we applied for the visa and we are waiting for it to be processed. But the whole story is overshadowed by the fact that our dog needs to be quarantined when we come to Britain. This dog is like a child to me. I plan all my business and trips taking into account its needs. She loves us very much, and we love her very much. My son is very worried that he will have to leave her. I don’t know how she’s going to make it through the breakup.” Thom, from Lincolnshire, said: “I felt strongly that I should host somebody with a dog. The only laboratory in Ukraine that does blood tests after pets have had rabies jabs to confirm they have antibodies is now closed due to the war. The laboratory facilities in Poland where many people have fled to are also not processing pet blood tests at the moment. Until visa applications have been completed, pets can’t be booked into quarantine facilities here. “It’s a nightmare for anyone coming into the country. I couldn’t give up my dogs. I have four miniature schnauzers – three are rescue dogs – so know how it must feel for Ukrainians to be separated from their pets by the quarantine process. We were brought together by our love of miniature schnauzers. We send each other photos of our dogs sunbathing – typical schnauzer behaviour.” Robin Jax, a musician, is now in the UK with his Ukrainian wife, Miroslava, and his mother-in-law, Hanna Tkachenko, who uses a wheelchair. However, their beloved cat Peter is still in Poland because of quarantine procedures. The family fears that the cat might have to spend an extended period separated from them. “Poland waived certain requirements for non-EU pets when we came over the border,” said Jax. “Peter the cat had full vaccinations in Kyiv before the war. We called Heathrow airport to get some advice and they said that Ukraine was not a ‘listed country’ for Defra’s [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] purposes. I can’t imagine what months in quarantine will do to Peter, who is 11.” The cat is currently staying with the family’s hosts in Poland. “I hope the cat can hang on. We know he’s in loving care, but it’s a very tense and difficult time.” A Defra spokesperson said: “We have put in place a new streamlined process for people bringing their pets from Ukraine. The Animal and Plant Health Agency will provide quick approvals and relevant quarantine arrangements, for which we will cover the costs.”",News/World news,Ukrainian refugees could face months of separation from pets under UK rules,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/ukrainian-refugees-separation-pets-under-uk-rules-quarantine
