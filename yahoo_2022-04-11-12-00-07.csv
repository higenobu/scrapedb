4/11/2022,"A number of GOP lawmakers have called on President Joe Biden to be impeached. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Sunday he has no plans to move forward with impeachment. ""We believe in the rule of law,"" McCarthy said of Republicans. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Sunday dismissed a question about whether or not he plans to introduce articles of impeachment against President Joe Biden, despite others in his party recently floating the idea. McCarthy was being interviewed on Fox News Sunday morning when host Maria Bartiromo played a clip of Republican Rep. Greg Murphy saying he thinks Biden has committed impeachable offenses. Murphy added that some members of Congress are hesitant to impeach because they don't have confidence in Vice President Kamala Harris. Bartiromo then asked McCarthy if he was considering moving forward with impeachment. ""Look the one thing we learned that the Democrats did, is they used impeachment for political reason. We believe in the rule of law. We're not going to pick and choose just because somebody has power,"" McCarthy said, adding that ""at any time if someone breaks the law"" impeachment may be considered ""but we're not going to use it for political purposes."" Former President Donald Trump was impeached twice: first in 2019 over charges he withheld aid to Ukraine for personal political gain and again in 2021 on charges he incited an insurrection. Trump's first impeachment was along party lines, but 10 House Republicans voted with Democrats to impeach Trump over the Capitol riot. Other Republican lawmakers have called for Biden to be impeached, including GOP Reps. Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene.
