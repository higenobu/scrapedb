1/10/2022,"ORLANDO, Fla. — Bob Saget — a comedic legend who rose to fame on the hit show “Full House” — was found dead at Ritz-Carlton Orlando Sunday, Orange County Sheriff’s officials confirmed. He was 65. Detectives found no signs of foul play or drug use, according to a statement from the agency. “Earlier today, deputies were called to the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes for a call about an unresponsive man in a hotel room,” the agency wrote in a social media post. ”The man was identified as Robert Saget & pronounced deceased on scene. Detectives found no signs of foul play or drug use in this case.” Saget performed his stand-up comedy act Friday night at Hard Rock Live at Universal’s City Walk. He had been on a tour of Florida cities with his act. In a 2019 interview with the Orlando Sentinel TV critic Hal Boedeker, Saget discussed how his very adult stand-up act was in stark contrast to his “Full House” and “Fuller House” family man character, Danny Tanner. “I’m still an R-rated act. I’m ‘South Park,’ I’m a 9-year-old kid that learned all the words,” Saget said, chuckling. “I’ve got a certain amount of wisdom from being 62. There’s a little more parenting in what I do in a joking way. I think I’m more myself than I ever have been onstage.” Saget said that was was hopeful that the Plaza Live audience he was going to perform for in 2019 would be varied (his act is for 17 and older). “It looks like my kind of crowd. I get anyone from 18 with a fake ID to 90,” he said. “So I hope a bunch of 90-year-olds come as a mosh pit.” ———",U.S./Orlando Sentinel,Comedian Bob Saget found dead at Orlando hotel,https://news.yahoo.com/comedian-bob-saget-found-dead-014000286.html
1/10/2022,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA’s new space telescope opened its huge, gold-plated, flower-shaped mirror Saturday, the final step in the observatory's dramatic unfurling. The last portion of the 21-foot (6.5-meter) mirror swung into place at flight controllers’ command, completing the unfolding of the James Webb Space Telescope. “I’m emotional about it. What an amazing milestone. We see that beautiful pattern out there in the sky now,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, chief of NASA’s science missions. More powerful than the Hubble Space Telescope, the $10 billion Webb will scan the cosmos for light streaming from the first stars and galaxies formed 13.7 billion years ago. To accomplish this, NASA had to outfit Webb with the largest and most sensitive mirror ever launched — its “golden eye,” as scientists call it. Webb is so big that it had to be folded orgami-style to fit in the rocket that soared from South America two weeks ago. The riskiest operation occurred earlier in the week, when the tennis court-size sunshield unfurled, providing subzero shade for the mirror and infrared detectors. Flight controllers in Baltimore began opening the primary mirror Friday, unfolding the left side like a drop-leaf table. The mood was even more upbeat Saturday, with peppy music filling the control room as the right side snapped into place. After applauding, the controllers immediately got back to work, latching everything down. They jumped to their feet, exchanged high-fives and cheered from behind masks when the operation was finally complete 2 1/2 hours later, doing their best to remain socially distant because of the global surge in COVID-19 cases. “We have a deployed telescope on orbit, a magnificent telescope the likes of which the world has never seen,” Zurbuchen said, congratulating the team. “So how does it feel to make history, everybody? You just did it.” His counterpart at the European Space Agency, astronomer Antonella Nota, noted that after years of preparation, the team made everything look “so amazingly easy.” “This is the moment we have been waiting for, for so long,” she said. Webb's main mirror is made of beryllium, a lightweight yet sturdy and cold-resistant metal. Each of its 18 segments is coated with an ultra thin layer of gold, highly reflective of infrared light. The hexagonal, coffee table-size segments must be adjusted in the weeks ahead so they can focus as one on stars, galaxies and alien worlds that might hold atmospheric signs of life. “It's like we have 18 mirrors that are right now little prima donnas all doing their own thing, singing their own tune in whatever key they're in, and we have to make them work like a chorus and that is a methodical, laborious process,"" operations project scientist Jane Rigby told reporters. Webb should reach its destination 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away in another two weeks; it's already more than 667,000 miles (1 million kilometers) from Earth since its Christmas Day launch. If all continues to go well, science observations will begin this summer. Astronomers hope to peer back to within 100 million years of the universe-forming Big Bang, closer than Hubble has achieved. Project manager Bill Ochs stressed the team isn't letting its guard down, despite the unprecedented successes of the past two weeks. “It's not downhill from here. It's all kind of a level playing field,"" he said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.
