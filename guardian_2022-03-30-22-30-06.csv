3/30/2022,"More than 4 million people have fled Russia’s “utterly senseless” war on Ukraine, the United Nations has said, as the Kremlin played down hopes of an early breakthrough a day after peace talks between the two sides. “We cannot state that there was anything too promising or any breakthroughs,” the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Wednesday. He said it was “positive” that Kyiv had outlined its demands but there was “a lot of work to be done”. Ukraine and its western allies dismissed a promised Russian military pullback from near Kyiv as a strategic ploy after heavy losses, and Moscow’s bombardment of cities from Chernihiv in the north to Mariupol in the south continued unabated. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said 4,019,287 people had fled abroad since the start of Russia’s invasion on 24 February, surpassing the agency’s initial estimate that the war would create up to 4 million refugees. More than 90% are women and children. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said on Twitter he had just arrived in Ukraine and was beginning discussions with authorities, the UN and other partners on “ways to increase our support to people affected and displaced by this senseless war”. The agency has said the speed and scale of the displacement was unprecedented in Europe since the second world war. The UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) said that as of mid-March, 6.48 million people were also internally displaced. “They need urgent, life-saving aid,” the organisation said on Wednesday. Before the war, Ukraine had a population of 37 million in the regions under government control, excluding Crimea and the Russian-controlled regions in the east. At the talks in Istanbul on Tuesday, Ukraine proposed a framework for peace under which it would remain neutral, with its security guaranteed by third-party countries through a treaty similar to Nato’s article 5 mutual defence commitment. The proposals, intended to come into force only in the event of a complete ceasefire, also included a 15-year consultation period on the status of the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow seized from Ukraine and annexed in 2014. Moscow described the talks as “meaningful” and “constructive” and subsequently pledged to “radically reduce” its military activity in northern Ukraine as a goodwill gesture to “to increase mutual trust” in the peace negotiations. But Peskov said on Wednesday that Crimea was part of Russia and the Russian constitution precluded discussing the fate of any Russian region with anyone else. He also said Moscow wanted the substance of discussions to remain private. Western analysts and diplomats noted that Russia’s offer to partially pull back came after its advance, thwarted by stiff resistance and supply problems, had all but stalled, and that Moscow had already said it was refocusing its military goals on expanding the territory held by pro-Russia separatists in the eastern Donbas regions. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made clear he took nothing Moscow said at face value. “Ukrainians are not naive people,” he said. “Ukrainians have already learned … that the only thing they can trust is a concrete result.” The UN on Wednesday also named three human rights experts, led by a Norwegian judge, Erik Møse, to investigate possible war crimes in Ukraine, where Russia’s armed forces are accused of killing and inflicting suffering on civilians. The UN’s human rights body agreed in a historic vote this month to set up the highest-level investigation possible into Russia’s actions since the start of the invasion, including the bombing and shelling of residential areas. Moscow denies targeting civilians. While western sanctions have cut Russia out of much of world trade, the country remains a major supplier of oil and gas to Europe with EU governments deeply divided over how fast their economies can be weaned off Russian energy. Germany, Russia’s biggest gas customer, on Wednesday announced an “early warning” of a possible emergency if Russia cuts off supplies, a move that could lead to the government rationing power. Its economy minister, Robert Habeck, urged consumers and companies to reduce consumption, saying “every kilowatt-hour counts”. Isolated diplomatically as well as economically, meanwhile, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, insisted on a visit to Beijing that Russia would move “together with China and our sympathisers … towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order”. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said Moscow and Beijing would continue their efforts in “advancing global multipolarity and the democratisation of international relations”, adding: “Our striving for peace has no limits, our upholding of security has no limits, our opposition towards hegemony has no limits.”",News/World news,"More than 4 million flee Russia’s ‘senseless’ war on Ukraine, says UN",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/more-than-4-million-flee-russia-senseless-war-on-ukraine-says-un
3/30/2022,"In a morass of bad climate news, from collapsing ice shelves to the potential resurgence of coal in Europe, there is a sliver of good news. There could be fewer heatwaves declared in England this summer. However, this won’t be due to a reversal of global heating, or a summer cool snap across Britain. Instead, the Met Office is changing the definition of a heatwave in eight counties by raising the required temperature threshold. Rather than marking some new scientific standard for heatwaves, this new definition is simply a normalisation of higher temperatures in the UK. It will probably lead to fewer news reports and official statistics about heatwaves, without representing any actual respite from the record high temperatures of the past decade. It seems it’s easier to change the optics of climate breakdown than it is to address runaway warming. The shift varies from county to county. In six southern counties, the boundary has nudged up from 27C to 28C, and jumps from 26C to 27C in Lincolnshire and from 25C to 26C in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Heatwave limits were originally calculated based on the climate between 1981 and 2010, while the new thresholds will use a 1990-2020 average. The bad news is the UK was heating up significantly in the 1990-2020 period due to climate breakdown; an “undeniable warming trend” is behind the moving of the goalposts, according to the Met Office. Thresholds themselves seem relatively arbitrary, but given the Met Office explains that the purpose of a heatwave definition is to “provide the media and public with consistent and reliable messaging”, this shift will probably mask the escalation of climate impacts in the UK. Heatwaves kill in England and will continue to do so even below the new threshold. There’s a term for this in the environment world: shifting baseline syndrome. It refers to the gradual change in accepted norms for the condition of the natural environment. As we lose knowledge and experience of the environment of the past, the direction of travel is a steady lowering of standards, normalising deterioration, destruction and species decline. The term was first used in 1995 by marine biologist Daniel Pauly, regarding fish. He noted that marine scientists often assumed the “normal” baseline for fish numbers was the “unaffected” quantity at the beginning of their careers. Rather than restore stocks to the abundance of three centuries ago, conservation was confined to a window of a couple of decades, ignoring the drastic lowering of the baseline before their careers. This was leading to an unconscious acceptance of species decline. Shifting baseline syndrome permeates all elements of our natural world, as familiarity of wilder habitats and cooler climes recedes. Our baseline standards of heat are no different. This is the danger in redefining heatwaves: these definitions are pegs on which to hang our experiences, and indeed our expectations. If the barometer changes through time too, what is left to measure extreme heat events against? Take as one example the literal shifting of baseline years used to calculate emissions reductions. Some nations compare their net zero targets against emissions in 1990, others in 2005 (the latter a higher emissions year). Calculating from a higher point makes subsequent annual cuts appear deeper and more impressive in percentage points, even though there is no material difference in carbon reduction. Similarly, the lifting of the heatwave bar could play into the hands of climate deniers by implying there are fewer extreme heat events in England. England is famous for its drizzle and inhospitable greyness, but this is changing rapidly as climate impacts increase. Prof Nigel Arnell of the University of Reading said that the temperature threshold change likely won’t be the last – we will have to keep redefining heatwaves “otherwise we’ll have a heatwave every summer”. Unfortunately, a new name won’t stop soaring temperatures shocking our health, infrastructure and working conditions. Definitions matter profoundly and the instability of our climate deserves stable classifications against which to measure it. Without them, we risk losing our grip on the natural environment before the shocks of fossil capitalism. Like frogs in a slowly boiling pot, we may even begin to tolerate extreme heat on this formerly inclement island.

3/30/2022,"Alec Stewart has defended the County Championship, with Surrey’s director of cricket insisting England’s first-class system is an adequate breeding ground for producing Test-quality players despite England’s woes. “The gulf between the Championship and Test cricket has gotten bigger,” said Stewart, who captained England in 15 of his 133 Tests. “Test players used to play county cricket. They would finish a Test and play a Championship match the next day. [County players] would be bowling to Graham Gooch or Mike Gatting or facing high-quality overseas bowlers. The quality of overseas player has diminished.” Stewart blamed a congested Test calendar as well as the proliferation of T20 franchise leagues around the world for the decline. With Kolpak contracts having come to an end last year, restricting the influx of South African and Caribbean players with Test experience, the standard of the County Championship will need to be raised by locally produced talent, he says. “We’ve still got good players [in the Championship], you’ve got excellent coaches,” Stewart said. “When they go up it’s a massive jump and it’s a massive jump in all domestic cricket around the world. The scrutiny you’re under now is greater than it was. That’s when you need selection to be strong. If you’re good enough for one game you’re generally good enough for five or six.” Stewart singled out Ollie Pope as “high class”. But with a first-class average above 50, and a Test average of 28.66 from 40 innings, Pope’s numbers appear to support the claim that England’s domestic system is battling to bear fruit. For Surrey’s head coach, Gareth Batty, the problem lies further up the supply chain: “There are less senior players in the England XI at the minute. So young players are going in and having to fend off like a senior player. That is why it isn’t working. It isn’t the quality of the young player.” After a poor Ashes return of 69 runs from six innings, Pope was not selected for the Tests against the West Indies. Rory Burns was another who failed to make the touring squad having struggled in Australia, registering two ducks from six knocks at the top of the order, including the first ball of the series. Along with Sam Curran, who is close to a return to full fitness after a lower-back injury, Surrey have a clutch of England players eager to return to the fold. “Our duty is to help them get back to where they want to be,” Batty said, adding that he believes Burns is “the best opener in the country. I’m not worried about him putting his best case across. I worry about who might select the [England] team.”",Sport/Sport,Alec Stewart insists county cricket is producing ‘high class’ Test players,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/30/alec-stewart-county-cricket-england-high-class-test-players
3/30/2022,"At Victoria’s first state funeral, a cortege bearing the caskets of Robert O’Hara Burke and William John Wills was led by six black-plumed horses. At John Monash’s funeral, in 1931, nearly 300,000 people, a third of Melbourne’s population, lined the streets. Shane Warne didn’t explore the Australian interior. He didn’t break the Hindenburg Line. He bowled leg-breaks for Australia. On Wednesday night, the Melbourne Cricket Ground bade farewell to him. It’s where he dreamed of playing Australian rules football. It’s where he skittled the West Indies. It’s where he took the first Ashes hat-trick in 90 years. It’s where, under temperamental skies and in front of 90,000 people, he took his 700th Test wicket. It’s where, as news of his death filtered through, scores of people gathered – in the middle of the night, and in torrential rain – to pay homage. Memorial services such as this are often stuffy affairs. This was nothing of the sort. The man being honoured was no statesman. It wasn’t a pious occasion. There were no political scores to settle. There was no Bach, no Yeats – just Williams and Sheeran. Instead of an archbishop, ceremonies were conducted by a TV personality. There was no gothic splendour – just a cavernous, concrete colosseum. In the weeks after his death, there had been a ghoulish fascination with his final hours and the repatriation of his body. There were tut-tutting tweets and tedious opinion pieces. This service redressed the balance. There was a proper sense of who he was, the joy he brought and his prodigious talent and reach. From Elton John to the United Nations; from Kylie Minogue to Sachin Tendulkar. How does anybody top that? But it was impossible to listen to Warne’s three children – Jackson, Brooke and Summer – and not feel a desperate sadness. Their father was 52 when he died. He would stand on the sidelines at local netball games, snore on the couch, secure backstage passes, blare Bryan Adams and embarrass them on social media. Everyone wanted a dad like Shane Warne. For all his travels, travails and trespasses, he was a wonderful father. Underpinning all their tributes was an aching sense of loss. His ordinariness, his impeccable manners and complete lack of pretence and malice were recurring themes all night. Over the years, his fame went solar. Some of his partners, as Clive James once said of Grace Kelly, were born with a silver dinner set in their mouth. But Warne never really changed. Not many of us have a bowling alley in our house, date supermodels or are photographed wielding giant inflatable dildos. But he was never one of those superstars at arm’s length. He was instantly familiar to us. He never shied away from his fame or his mistakes. He whinged about the same things as us on Twitter. He listened to the same music. He loved nothing more, as Gideon Haigh once wrote, than curling up in bed with a good phone. This just wouldn’t have felt right at Melbourne’s St Paul’s Cathedral. It had to be at the MCG. He loved this place. When the house was full and the occasion had weight his eyes would dance and his face would light up. Some days, if he was fielding on the boundary or walking off after another haul, he’d look up at the locals like a big puppy. Before his final MCG Test, he said he was almost “turned on”. The Great Southern Stand officially became the Shane Warne Stand. Thirty years ago, just after it had been constructed, Richie Richardson marvelled that the ground held more people than the population of his country [Antigua]. Some days, Warne would wake up certain that he would score a century. On day five of this Test, with his unbuttoned shirt, gold chains and broad-brimmed sunhat, he was in murderous touch. At that point, Warne had peroxide blond hair, lime zinc cream and a Test bowling average of 90. But he knocked over the West Indies captain with a flipper. As his brother told us, he had been practicing it for years. Only now did he have the balls to unleash it. Richardson looked down at the pitch with contempt. Warne’s life, and his sport, would never be the same again. Victorian cricket crowds are hopelessly parochial. We claimed Warne, embraced him, forgave him a lot. At the end of a day’s play, after he had torn through a tail, we would file out, a little lighter on our feet, shaking our heads, reliving his wickets, imitating his action. This time, however, no one quite knew what to do or how to leave. There was no theme song blaring. There was no one on the public address system perforating our eardrums. There were no drunks to step around. There was no win or loss to dissect. Many stood shyly – at a cricket pitch distance – around his statue. It was festooned with stubbies of beer, champagne magnums, packets of darts, cricket balls and flowers. After the bushfire summer and the two lost years of Covid, it has been a glorious few months in Melbourne. The wind whipped harder and light drizzle fell. In dribs and drabs, they exited to the various compass points of the city. There were lots of little hands clutching bigger ones. They’d remembered and celebrated a phenomenal talent – an ordinary man whose life was utterly uninventable and cruelly cut short.",Sport/Sport,Shane Warne remembered with joy in his favourite concrete colosseum | Jonathan Horn,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/30/shane-warne-remembered-favourite-concrete-colosseum-melbourne-cricket-ground
3/30/2022,"According to Bafta publicity, 66% of the performance nominees for this year’s TV awards are first-timers. It points out that this continues the academy’s aim to honour newer and broader talent, including Channel 4’s We Are Lady Parts, about a Muslim punk band – but, overall, the prizes are strikingly dominated by three great figures from TV’s baby boomer generation. There are a combined 17 nominations for It’s a Sin (many of them to young actors) and Time – dramas created respectively by Jimmy McGovern, 72, and Russell T Davies, 58. The latter is the same age as Graham Norton, who already holds five Baftas and is once again double nominated as presenter and producer of a series that, as it heads towards its 500th edition, competes only with Michael Parkinson’s to be the greatest ever British chatshow. And, continuing the apparent statute that she must appear in all showbiz prize lists, Olivia Colman, 48, a triple Bafta winner just back from this year’s Oscars ceremony, is nominated as a producer among the seven nods for Sky Atlantic’s Landscapers, though, unusually, not for her acting. At a time of proper scrutiny of width of opportunity, the challenge for all awards-giving bodies is to honour the fresh and new while also recognising that originality and vigour can still be achieved by long-timers. This list largely does that. An exception is another relative veteran: Jed Mercurio, 55. His Line of Duty has never won a Bafta in any category and its only chances from the sixth (and possibly final) season come in three categories for the TV Craft awards – which celebrate behind-the-scenes talent – editing, music and sound. The actors (including Adrian Dunbar’s magnificent Supt Ted Hastings) may have suffered in jury rooms from a sense that these performances have been running for a decade now, and the most recent episodes may have been marked down for a pay-off some found unsatisfying. But future historians will see in Owen Teale’s chief constable Osbourne and Nigel Boyle’s DSU Buckells – lying, lazy mediocrities who rise lethally above their capabilities – prescient warnings about the consequences of electing Boris Johnson, all the more impressive for being sneaked past a BBC that may not have realised how brave it was being. Bafta has various special awards at its disposal and should use one to correct the disgraceful neglect of Mercurio and Line of Duty. With that show overlooked, the BBC should be grateful to Time, which gives the corporation its strongest presence among the drama contenders. From the extraordinary psychological and emotional duel between Sean Bean’s agonised inmate and Stephen Graham’s tortured prison warder, jurors have chosen Bean, although he may still be beaten by Graham, who makes the same shortlist for Help, the Channel 4 care home drama that gives the Covid pandemic its most direct reflection in the prizes. Confirming Graham’s status as one of the best screen actors, a place has been found for his Time performance in the supporting actor category. At a time when the BBC is facing an existential debate with the government over its future funding and structure, the Bafta selections are worrying for the director general, Tim Davie. Broadcasting House is at least matched in fiction by ITV – with Stephen, Too Close, Unforgotten and Manhunt: The Night Stalker – and the corporation’s giant news division, often cited as a primary justification for the licence fee, is squeezed out in news coverage by ITV (twice), Sky News and Channel 4 News. This may reflect juror concern about last year’s revelations of the historical BBC coverup of Martin Bashir’s methods to secure a 1995 interview with Diana, Princess of Wales, plus an industry sense that BBC journalism was too close to the government over Covid and too timid on “partygate”. The recently appointed news supremo Deborah Turness, incoming from ITN, should take the empty trophy shelf as evidence of serious issues to be addressed. At least BBC current affairs looks in better health, with one of the greatest documentarians, Norma Percy, honoured for Trump Takes on the World. Yet that show – and BBC Two’s shortlisted Four Hours at the Capitol – were made for the BBC by external production companies, as were the vast majority of BBC nominees. The poor showing by the production arm BBC Studios – apart from Time and Strictly Come Dancing – may be problematic for Davie in defending the present shape and scale of the BBC. Trophies are only one metric, but the BBC has used them often in the past as self-advertising. Conversely, Channel 4, which is fighting government threats of privatisation, may be helped. Its big contenders – It’s A Sin, We Are Lady Parts, Help – could all be used as examples of the sort of bold work made possible by not having to share profits with shareholders. (Although the vast salaries of Channel 4’s leaders sit oddly with a state-owned business.) Those at the culture department who wonder about some merging of Channel 4 and the BBC as a public service network may beadily note the curiosity that Channel 4’s Grenfell: The Untold Story was made by BBC Studios. Another mark of the increasing democratisation of TV production is that the National Theatre receives its first ever Bafta TV nomination for Clint Dyer and Roy Williams’ Death of England: Face to Face, a movie shot in the building during lockdown as a sequel to two stage shows. It was also nominated for a Royal Television Society prize this year, as was another NT lockdown film, Romeo and Juliet. But another of the shivers for traditional TV is that the National, rather than partnering with Sky as for these films, might ultimately distribute screen work only through its own NT at Home streaming service or NT Live in cinemas: a model that may tempt other cultural producers. At the awards ceremony on 24 April, though, the most ominous moment for the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 tables will be the reading of the shortlist in the international category. This sextet – Call My Agent!, Lupin, Mare of Easttown, Squid Game, Succession, The Underground Railroad – would likely have wiped out most homegrown dramas if admitted into the domestic categories and illustrate where the money and heat in TV fiction now mainly are: Netflix (with three of the six), HBO-Sky Atlantic (two) and Amazon Studios. Under a recent adjustment, British actors in international shows can now compete for the performance awards, benefiting Kate Winslet for her sublime portrayal of a multiply guilty detective in Mare of Easttown and, from Succession, Matthew Macfadyen for supporting actor and Jesse Armstrong as writer. But Brad Ingelsby’s brilliant script for Winslet is excluded as he is American and Brian Cox, though eligible as British, has failed to make the actor list for Succession, presumably due its being such a packed category. With so much of the best programming coming from non-UK producers, there will surely soon have to be more international categories – much as the Emmys have a large non-US section – or wider qualification. As when the Booker prize extended its catchment zone to the US, there is a risk of UK talent being marginalised, but the alternative jeopardy is the Baftas looking like a Little Britain that does not reflect the balance of power in TV.",Arts/Television & radio,‘Disgraceful neglect of Line of Duty’: the wrongs and rights of the Bafta TV nominations,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/30/disgraceful-neglect-of-line-of-duty-the-wrongs-and-rights-of-the-bafta-tv-nominations
3/30/2022,"Republicans have kids on the brain. Over the course of the last year, conservative activists and Republican state lawmakers have been whipping up a set of interrelated moral panics over the supposed indoctrination of children in our schools and child abuse – from the notion that elementary school teachers are raising up junior divisions of the Black Panthers with critical race theory to the insistence that trans people, who today comprise less than half a percent of high-school athletes in the United States, might soon bring an end to girls’ sports. The word “grooming” is now in wide circulation on the right ⁠ – a dogwhistle that implies basic education on LGBT identity and sex is priming kids for predation, perhaps at the hands of the Satanic sex traffickers at the heart of QAnon’s conspiracy theories. All of this spilled into last week’s confirmation hearings for US supreme court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson, which Senate Republicans did their best to derail by mischaracterizing her sentencing on cases on child sexual abuse images. As has been widely reported, those sentences had been entirely in keeping with sentences delivered by most federal judges in comparable cases, including sentences delivered by Trump judicial appointees with broad Republican support. But that mattered not a whit to Republicans on the Hill. “Every judge who does what you’re doing is making it easier for the children to be exploited,” Lindsey Graham told Jackson in a heated exchange. Ted Cruz accused Jackson of “a record of activism and advocacy as it concerns sexual predators that stems back decades”. And Josh Hawley, best-known for defending Donald Trump’s allegations of election fraud and cheering on the rioters at the Capitol on January 6, led the pack with a fusillade of similar attacks on Jackson at the hearings and on social media. “I’ve noticed an alarming pattern when it comes to Judge Jackson’s treatment of sex offenders, especially those preying on children,” he tweeted ahead of the hearings. “Judge Jackson has a pattern of letting child porn offenders off the hook for their appalling crimes, both as a judge and as a policymaker.” Again, the Republican attacks on Jackson’s record, like the rest of their fearmongering about kids these days, have been ludicrous. It is true, though, that one of our parties has proven itself remarkably willing to defend sexual predators in recent years. Here’s a genuinely alarming pattern the senator should take an interest in. In 2016, former Republican speaker of the House Dennis Hastert ⁠was convicted for trying to pay off men he had sexually abused as a high school wrestling coach. His victims had been boys between the ages of 14 and 17 at the time. After Hastert had pleaded guilty to making a set of payments, Hastert’s legal team compiled 41 letters in defense of his character from friends and former colleagues, including Republican congressmen David Dreier, Porter Goss, John Doolittle, Thomas Ewing, and the former Republican House majority whip Tom DeLay. “We all have our flaws, but Dennis Hastert has very few,” Delay wrote. “I ask that you consider the man that is before you and give him leniency where you can.” Unmoved, US district judge Thomas M Durkin sentenced Hastert to over a year in prison. “Nothing is more stunning,” he said, “than to have the words ‘serial child molester’ and ‘speaker of the House’ in the same sentence.” The Hastert case might have stunned more people if Americans hadn’t been busy following the 2016 campaign, with its flurry of sex and other scandals, at the time. But the sexual misconduct allegations that had piled up against Donald Trump, from well over a dozen women by the year’s end, have since been mostly forgotten by the press and the public ⁠– including allegations from five contestants in Trump’s Miss Teen USA pageants that he would walk into dressing rooms while girls as young as 15 were changing. Notably, Trump had previously boasted to Howard Stern that he would intentionally walk in on undressing contestants in the adult Miss USA pageants. “You know, they’re standing there with no clothes,” he’d said in an appearance on Stern’s show. “And you see these incredible-looking women ⁠– so I sort of get away with things like that.” ⁠In fairness to Trump, a number of Miss Teen USA contestants either directly disputed the recollections of his accusers, or told reporters they couldn’t remember Trump being present in the dressing rooms. What is not in dispute is that Trump also happened to enjoy a friendship of well over a decade with Jeffrey Epstein. This past December, a former Miss Teen USA contestant testifying at the sex-trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell told the court that she had met Trump through Epstein at the age of 14. That raises more questions about whether Trump knew of Epstein’s activities ⁠– in 2002, he’d told a reporter that Epstein liked women “on the younger side” ⁠– although it’s not at all obvious how much he would have cared if he had. After Maxwell’s arrest in July 2020, Trump told reporters that he had interacted with Maxwell socially “numerous times” but hadn’t been following the case closely. “I just wish her well, frankly,” he said. Incredibly, Maxwell wasn’t the first accused accused sexual offender Trump had wished well from the White House. In 2017, Alabama’s Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore was accused of romantically and sexually pursuing teenagers while in his 30s, including a woman who told the Washington Post that Moore had molested her when she was 14. “On a second visit, she says, he took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes,” the Post reported. “He touched her over her bra and underpants, she says, and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear.” Initially, Republicans met the allegations – which Moore denies – with the kind of response one would expect from a responsible major party. The Republican National Committee pulled its support from the campaign, and Republican leaders including Republican party chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell called on Moore to step aside. Then, about a month after the allegations broke, Trump officially endorsed Moore by tweet. And, on the very same day, the Republican National Committee recommitted itself to the Moore campaign. “The RNC is the political arm of the president,” a senior RNC official explained, “and we support the president.” This is worth repeating. In 2017, the Republican party now babbling nonsense about public schools and LGBTQ people grooming children for sexual abuse ⁠– the party that spent the past week in the Senate arguing that Democrats are soft on pedophiles ⁠– officially backed a credibly accused child molester for election to that very body. If the Republican National Committee had gotten its way, there’s a chance we would have spent the past week hearing Roy Moore opine on Jackson’s ethical qualifications. It’s a mercy of sorts that we heard instead from the likes of Hawley who, as the White House noted earlier this month, refused to say whether he’d vote for Moore during his own campaign. The Republican party’s ambivalence on child abuse extends beyond pure politics and the protection of accused politicians. Nearly 300,000 children between the ages of 15 to 17 were married in the United States between 2000 and 2018. An estimated 60,000 of them were below the age of sexual consent in their respective states; it’s thought that roughly 80% of American child marriages overall are between girls under 18 and adult men. Activists across the country have been pushing hard against those figures over the last few years. And while resistance to child marriage bans can be found on both sides of the ideological spectrum ⁠– which one would expect given that child marriage was legal in all 50 states as recently as 2017 – some of the most dogged defenders of the status quo have been red-state Republicans. Not long ago, for instance, the Kansas City Star called Josh Hawley’s state of Missouri “a destination wedding spot for 15-year-old brides” – especially ones who had been impregnated by men, thanks to uncommonly lax laws that facilitated the marriages of more than 7,000 children between 2000 and 2014. When a ban on marriages to children 14 or younger advanced by a Republican party representative came up for a vote in February 2018, it was opposed by 50 members of the Missouri house – two Democrats and 48 members of her own party. Thankfully, that bill still passed the chamber, and a comprehensive ban on all marriages of adults over 21 to children under 18 was signed into law in Missouri later that year. But the significance of Republican lawmakers’ hesitation wasn’t lost on the marriage ban’s advocates. “Last week they were arguing that the government should be involved in approving a minor’s abortion,” Missouri representative Peter Merideth told the Riverfront Times after February’s vote. “So it’s a mind-boggling contrast when a minor who’s not even old enough to enter into a legally binding contract is being told they can enter into a relationship that makes statutory rape legal.” It’s no mystery why Hawley and other Republicans are more interested in inventing child abuses and a record of leniency for abusers among Democrats than they are in criticizing their own party’s tolerance for predators. The more interesting question is why Democrats haven’t discredited the right’s narratives on this front more forcefully. While the party’s hands aren’t fully clean ⁠– Bill Clinton was on Epstein’s flights too, after all ⁠– the hesitance to engage more aggressively probably has less to do with that than it does with their preference for a particular mode of response to Republican attacks in general. Feigned surprise and the performance of indignation have been the twin pillars of Democratic counter-messaging for as long as anyone can remember. Pundits have puzzled about the lack of cover Dick Durbin and Senate Democrats offered to Jackson over the course of the hearings; one explanation that makes as much sense as any other is that Democrats assumed the attacks on Jackson would backfire naturally and make Senate Republicans look bad ahead of November’s midterms. Time will tell if they were right, but we have ample reason to doubt it.

3/30/2022,"The European Commission is calling for an end to fast fashion by 2030, as it announced a vast expansion of eco-design rules that could in future apply to any product, starting with textiles. The EU executive also wants large companies to disclose how much unsold stock they send to landfill, as part of a wide-ranging plan to crack down on throwaway culture. EU eco-design rules, which set energy efficiency standards for a host of consumer goods, such as toasters and washing machines, will also in future cover durability and recyclability. Manufacturers, for example, may have to use a certain amount of recycled content in their goods, or curb the use of materials that make them hard to recycle. “The products we use every day need to last,” Frans Timmermans, the European Commission vice-president in charge of the EU green deal, told reporters. “If products break we should be able to fix them. A smartphone should not lose its functionality,” he said, gesturing to his own device and voicing frustration that it was not possible to change the battery without going to specialists. “The clothes we wear should last longer than three washes and should also be recyclable,” he added. The EU environment commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevičius, said the commission wanted fast fashion “to get out of fashion”, saying: “By 2030 textiles placed on the EU market should be long-lived and recyclable, made to a large extent of recycled fibres.” He voiced optimism that consumers – sold the idea of constantly updating their look – would embrace the agenda: “They [clothes] will not need to be thrown away and replaced as often as now and that way consumers will actually gain a nice alternative, an attractive alternative to fast fashion.” It remains unclear how far the plans will change the fashion industry, as decisions on regulating specific products have yet to be taken. Mattresses and carpets are seen as likely candidates for the first round of EU eco-design regulation. “It is very unlikely, almost impossible to see [the EU] applying rules to socks,” a senior EU official said. “What is much more likely is to apply rules across apparel or across footwear,” The average European throws away 11kg of clothes, shoes and other fabric goods every year. Textiles are the fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions, after food, housing and transport, as well as consuming vast amounts of water and raw materials. If the proposals come into force, they could have a big impact around the world, as nearly three-quarters of clothing and household textiles consumed in the EU are imported from elsewhere. The commission may also eventually ban the practice of sending unsold goods to landfill, although officials said they needed more information about the problem. An obligation on companies to disclose unsold products sent to landfill would be “a very effective reputation disincentive”, Sinkevičius said. The proposals form part of the EU’s “circular economy” plan, which aims to lighten Europe’s ecological footprint on the world’s natural resources. The commission also wants to amend EU consumer law in an attempt to outlaw greenwashing and planned obsolescence. Describing a product as “environmentally friendly” or “eco” will be banned when the substance of the claim cannot be demonstrated. Companies will also be obliged to tell consumers about features that shorten a product’s lifespan, for instance, software that stops or downgrades the functionality of smartphones and laptops over time. Nusa Urbancic, the director of the Changing Markets Foundation NGO, said the fashion industry had escaped the “polluter pays principle” for too long. “High street brands dazzle us with vast amounts of cheap clothes that aren’t designed to last for long, but they don’t pay for the mountains of waste that get dumped, including in developing countries. That is wrong and will likely now change, following today’s announcement,” she said.",News/Environment,EU wants to force fashion firms to make clothes more durable and recyclable,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/30/eu-wants-to-force-fashion-firms-to-make-clothes-more-durable-and-recyclable
3/30/2022,"An estimated 50 million people joined India’s two-day national strike this week, a fraction of the number expected to protest. Bank, factory and public transport workers disrupted services in six states on Monday and Tuesday, but the strike had limited impact across the rest of the country. The call to strike came from 10 trade unions to protest what they call “anti-worker, anti-farmer, anti-people and anti-national policies” of the Narendra Modi government. Workers are experiencing widespread economic hardship caused by job losses, plummeting incomes, high prices of essential foods and fuel, and chronic unemployment, all exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Among the list of demands made by the unions were universal social security coverage, a higher minimum wage, a halt to the sale of state assets and no further privatisation of public sector banks. The unions had predicted about 200 million workers would participate in the strike – which had as its slogan “Save People, Save Nation” – but some analysts said 50 million would be a generous estimate. It is difficult to be accurate in a country of India’s size. The states of Kerala and West Bengal banned government employees from joining the strike, and Maharashtra invoked an emergency law banning the 80,000 workers in its power companies from striking. India’s chronic unemployment was cited as another possible reason for the low turnout. In January, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy reported that 53 million Indians were unemployed. Those lucky enough to have jobs could have been too anxious to strike. Although normal life remained unaffected in most of the country, unionists described the strike as a success. Dr Dhondiram Karad, national vice-president of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, said: “There is intense discontent against the Modi government. With food, gas and fuel prices so high, it is hard for an ordinary family to live, but this government ignores the working class totally.” The national strike comes just months after a year of protest and unrest by farmers ended with the government forced to repeal a set of controversial farm laws. Farmers complained they had not been consulted on the laws and feared they would threaten their livelihoods. “All we want is to talk to the government,” said Karad. “They just don’t talk to us or listen to our concerns. Workers were not even mentioned in the last budget.” Analysts said the limited participation in the strike should not be interpreted as workers being happy with the Modi government. Dr Shyam Sunder, professor of human resource management at the Xavier School of Management, said: “It’s more that they have been weakened by job losses and slashed incomes, making their lives so precarious they probably feel their individual participation is unlikely to change the government’s macroeconomic policies.” A Times of India editorial called the national strike “a luxury that vulnerable unorganised sector workers can ill afford”. Sunder said the strike was flawed by not having the backing of opposition political parties. He added: “The unions missed a huge opportunity in the farmers’ agitation. That was when the industrial unions should have joined hands with them. Together, they could have forced the government to respond.”",News/Global development,Low turnout for India’s national two-day strike as 50 million join protests,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/30/india-national-strike-protests-modi
3/30/2022,"John Bolton, the former national security adviser, has revealed that he heard Donald Trump use the term “burner phones” several times and that they discussed how the disposable devices were deployed by people as a way of avoiding scrutiny of their calls. Bolton’s intervention compounds Trump’s difficulties amid a billowing controversy relating to seven hours and 37 minutes that are missing in official call logs. The gap occurs in records made for 6 January last year – the day of the violent insurrection at the US Capitol. The Washington Post and CBS News disclosed on Tuesday that the House committee investigating the insurrection is looking into a “possible cover-up” of the White House records. Documents originally held by the National Archives and turned over to the committee earlier this year showed a gap in Trump’s phone calls spanning precisely the period when hundreds of his supporters stormed the Capitol building. The news outlets, which obtained 11 pages of records including Trump’s official daily diary and a call log for the White House switchboard, reported that the House panel has begun an investigation into whether Trump used disposable “burner phones” to sidestep scrutiny. In a statement to the Post/CBS News, Trump said: “I have no idea what a burner phone is, to the best of my knowledge I have never even heard the term.” Not true, according to Bolton. In an interview with the Post/CBS News, the former national security adviser said that he recalled Trump “using the term ‘burner phones’ in several discussions and that Trump was aware of its meaning”. Bolton added that he and Trump had spoken “about how people have used ‘burner phones’ to avoid having their calls scrutinized,” according to Robert Costa, author of the Post/CBS News revelations along with Bob Woodward. At the heart of the January 6 committee investigation is whether Trump was directly involved in co-ordinating the breach of security at the Capitol on the day that Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election was to be certified by Congress. What Trump did, and who he talked to, as the insurrection was unfolding is central to the inquiry. The call logs obtained by the committee show that Trump spoke to several close associates on the morning of January 6, including his lawyer Rudy Giuliani and former senior adviser Steve Bannon. His daily diary shows an entry at 11.17 am for a phone call with “an unidentified person”, but after that the records fall silent. The next phone log is at 6.54pm when Trump asked the White House switchboard to put him through to his communications chief Dan Scavino. In those intervening 457 minutes Trump supporters and white supremacist groups had broken through police barricades, forcing vice president Mike Pence who was overseeing the certification process into hiding. A bipartisan Senate report connected seven deaths to the attack with more than 100 law enforcement officers injured.",News/US news,"Trump discussed ‘burner phones’ several times, John Bolton says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/30/trump-john-bolton-burner-phones-capitol-attack-january-6
3/30/2022,"An adaptation of The Jungle Book that reimagines the journey of Mowgli through the eyes of a climate refugee is part of the programme at this year’s Edinburgh international festival, which shines a spotlight on themes of refugeehood and migration. The outgoing festival director, Fergus Linehan, said the 75th anniversary programme was an opportunity to “pay tribute to our first artistic director, Rudolf Bing, a refugee of war in Europe”. “2022 is a special year for the festival,” he added. “We hope that it will mark a turning point in the pandemic that has changed all of our lives for the past two years … And it is my final year as festival director as we hand the reins over to a new generation.” Jungle Book Reimagined, by the internationally celebrated choreographer Akram Khan, is a magical retelling of Rudyard Kipling’s family classic featuring an original score and 10 international dancers. It follows a refugee child as he arrives in a deserted modern city where wild animals claim the streets as their own. Other festival highlights include a modern adaptation of Medea by former Scots makar Liz Lochhead, in which a woman flees her country to a dangerous foreign land. There is also Refuge, a series of 11 theatre, art, dance, film and conversations in collaboration with the Scottish Refugee Council; Counting and Cracking by S. Shakthidharan, which follows the journey of one Sri Lankan-Australian family over four generations, and The Traveller of Time, in which conductor Jordi Savall performs with musicians from Europe, the Middle East, China, India and north Africa to recreate the music in the travels of 14th-century Islamic scholar Ibn Battuta. Returning to Edinburgh’s theatres and concert halls at a scale not seen since 2019, 14 venues will host 87 events and more than 160 performances from more than 2,300 artists, spanning classical and contemporary music, theatre, opera and dance. The festival’s free opening concert at BT Murrayfield, called Macro, includes Australian contemporary circus powerhouse Gravity & Other Myths, First Nations dance company Djuki Mala, the National Youth Choir of Scotland and a number of Scottish musicians. Visitors are told to expect “a heart-in mouth” display of skill. The programme also features the international festival’s regular repertoire of formal classical concerts, including those by the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Philharmonia Orchestra, the Australian World Orchestra, the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra, Czech Philharmonic, Les Siècles, Hespèrion XXI, Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. The festival will have the world premiere of Scottish Ballet’s Coppélia, reinvented for the digital age by UK choreographers Jess and Morgs and the UK premiere of A Little Life based on the novel by Hanya Yanagihara, amongothers. “Set up after the second world war to unite people from different cultures through the arts, the festival’s raison d’être is just as relevant today as it was in 1947,” said the Scottish culture minister, Neil Gray. “As minister for refugees from Ukraine I’m pleased to see the themes of refugeehood, migration and inclusion in this year’s programme.” Nicola Benedetti, the award-winning Scottish violinist, will take over as director of the festival in October. Donald Wilson, Edinburgh’s culture and communities convener, paid tribute to Linehan, who “over the last seven years … has worked through an exceptional era of both social liberty and challenge to stage a festival programme both intimate and international”.",Arts/Culture,Edinburgh international festival to feature tales of refugees and migration,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/30/edinburgh-international-festival-to-feature-tales-of-refugees-and-migration
3/30/2022,"Twenty-five years ago, on Sunday 30 March 1997 at 6pm, Channel 5 launched in a blaze of glory. Provided your definition of glory is the Spice Girls and the comedian Tim Vine standing on a set that looked like the physical embodiment of a migraine. In the early months of the channel, any suspicions that it might not be the televisual equivalent of BBC Radio 4 were quickly confirmed when the director of programmes, Dawn Airey, referred to the station’s output as being based around the three Fs – football, films and, well, you can guess the other. It’s fair to say they probably didn’t have Melvyn Bragg on speed dial. Like all toddlers, Channel 5 spent its early years doing anything it could to get attention. Much of its programming was a hallucinogenic cacophony of awfulness, perhaps best symbolised by Naked Jungle, which aired in 2000. The one-off gameshow was part of a night celebrating 50 years of British naturism, which execs naturally took as an excuse to show a lot of nudity on TV. A stunningly ill-advised programme, it featured two teams competing in the buff in a Crystal Maze-style format, cheered on by the host, Keith Chegwin, who was resplendently naked save for a large helmet. On his head. Not surprisingly, the Daily Mail was aghast, accusing the broadcaster of “plumbing new depths”, and the programme was named the worst ever made by Radio Times in 2006. That said, the show garnered an impressive 2 million viewers and a record 20% audience share at the time. One woman even phoned the station to say it had cured her of postnatal depression. Yet Cheggers’ chopper wasn’t the most notorious appendage to appear on screen in Channel 5’s first decade. That honour went to Sam the pig. The Farm was a 2004 reality show in which celebrities including Vanilla Ice, Paul Daniels and Lady Victoria Hervey lived and worked on, you guessed it, a farm. It was the sort of “meh” output that barely registered with viewers or critics – until the moment Rebecca Loos masturbated a pig. Cue pandemonium, complaints to Ofcom and a stern rebuke from the RSPCA. I’m still not sure it was cruelty, as such. What it certainly was not was an edifying spectacle. It wasn’t all willies on Five, though. Some of the output was just desperately boring. In 2001, Touch the Truck featured Dale Winton heroically filling time at the Lakeside Shopping Centre in Thurrock, while 20 contestants had to keep their hands on a truck without falling asleep – unlike viewers at home. The eventual winner, Jerry Middleton, claimed victory after an astonishingly uneventful 82 hours and took home a Toyota Land Cruiser Amazon. The year 2000 brought The Wright Stuff, a live discussion show that ran in a morning slot for 18 years. Its host, Matthew Wright, was generally adept at straddling the line between outspokenness and controversy, but there were notable errors of judgment, not least the moment in 2002 when he wrongly identified the television presenter John Leslie as the alleged rapist referred to in Ulrika Jonsson’s autobiography. Even more crass was the slot that ran in October 2011, the day after Amanda Knox was released from jail after she was acquitted by the Italian court for the murder of Meredith Kercher. The debate was entitled “Foxy Knoxy: Would ya?” Would ya what? Make capital out of a brutal murder and discuss the physical attractiveness of the acquitted suspect? On balance, no, ya wouldn’t. Not content with making light of just one murder, the show repeated the trick a mere two months later. During a discussion of the killing of 16-year-old Liam Aitchison on the Isle of Lewis, Wright put on a Scottish accent and delivered the Taggart catchphrase “There’s been another murder” before laughing. There was widespread condemnation, and 2,200 complaints to Ofcom, making it the most complained about programme of the year. As Channel 5 has grown older, however, it has begun to show signs of maturing. The fondness for the three Fs didn’t last, replaced in recent years by the three Rs: railways, royalty and rather a lot of programmes set in Yorkshire. It’s a strategy that seems to be paying off. Respected broadcasters such as Jeremy Paxman, Michael Portillo, Jeremy Vine and Chris Packham began to appear in the schedules. In 2018, Michael Palin in North Korea was unmissable, and stalwarts such as Ben Fogle’s studies of alternative lifestyles in New Lives in the Wild were genuinely interesting, and handled with a sensitivity that would once have been unthinkable. In 2018, Channel 5 won its first Bafta, for Cruising with Jane McDonald, while the Modern Britain strand has shown some searingly powerful documentaries: The Abused, a 90-minute film following the experiences of two abused women from emergency call to courtroom, won best documentary awards at the Edinburgh television festival and Association of International Broadcasters Awards. The study of male suicide, Suicidal: In Our Own Words, following six patients at the Riverside Mental Health Centre in west London, won a coveted Grierson award. In 2020, the station was named channel of the year at both the Broadcast and Royal Television Society awards. A recent emphasis on homegrown drama has also reaped dividends. The charming remake of All Creatures Great and Small is a hit with viewers and critics alike (even if the theme tune isn’t as good as the original). It is, of course, set in Yorkshire. And last year’s The Drowning, a thriller starring Jill Halfpenny, drew in Channel 5’s largest ever audience – more than 6 million. In an age where traditional broadcasters are faced with dwindling audiences thanks to the arrival of the streaming giants, the temptation could have been to pursue headlines, outrage and tacky controversy. Instead, Channel 5 has adopted a gentler, more considered approach. Yes, there is a lot of celebrity caravanning, true crime and God’s own county. And yes, there has been a programme called Penguin A&E with Lorraine Kelly, which was frankly more Partridge than penguin. But could it be that, aged 25, Channel 5 is finally growing up?",Arts/Television & radio,"Naked Cheggers, Rebecca Loos with a pig and Baftas for Jane McDonald: it’s 25 years of Channel 5!",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/30/naked-cheggers-rebecca-loos-and-a-pig-and-baftas-for-jane-mcdonald-its-25-years-of-channel-5
