2/2/2022,"The past week has seen artists such as Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Graham Nash and Nils Lofgren stand up to Spotify, boycotting the streaming giant because of Covid-19 misinformation spread on its popular and exclusively available The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Their protest has been applauded by many, but indie rapper Open Mike Eagle tweeted a very different perspective.  “I love Neil Young but i’m not following that crazy rich man anywhere,” he wrote before adding: “what’s the protest option for non set for life musicians?” Eagle says that the logic of following in Young’s anti-Spotify footsteps seems convoluted to the point of absurdity, adding: “If we’re going to do collective work as musicians to try and affect something, why don’t we start with the low rates that Spotify pays musicians? That affects me more as a musician than whatever Joe Rogan said on his podcast.” While he wouldn’t give hard numbers, Eagle recalled earning 90% profits from each $10 CD he sold at the beginning of his career. Compared with the approximate .003 cents ra stream he earns from his approximately 120,000-150,000 monthly Spotify listeners, Eagle says that is “a pretty big change from the way things were”. The Young-Spotify saga (which prompted the platform to add an advisory pointing listeners to correct Covid-19 information, as the company began losing billions in market value before Rogan semi-apologized on Instagram) has also sparked debates in other genres. Eve 6, for instance, tweeted: “our stupid band gets close to a million monthly streams on spotify. spotify pays out .003 cents per stream. 100% of that goes to our former label sony who is a part owner of Spotify. this is why i’m mad.” What’s more: Eve 6 frontman Max Collins tells the Guardian many acts, including his band, cannot remove their music from Spotify because they do not own their masters. Some that do fret the loss of exposure and what income they do gain on the platform. One artist with such concerns is Nashville singer-songwriter Katie Pruitt, who tweeted: “Honestly wish I could take my music off Spotify as a form of protest but my broke ass actually needs the .00331 cents per stream. If you’re thinking about cancelling your Spotify membership please also consider buying concert tickets/merch/vinyl ect [sic].” While Pruitt didn’t respond to interview requests (along with reps for Young, Rogan, Spotify, Mitchell and Lofgren), a number of artists who commented on her viral tweet did. Anaheim Americana artist Bobbo Byrnes stood out as eager to join Young’s Spotify boycott, regardless of the impact on his comparatively meager bottom line. Byrnes says 2021 was his biggest year yet on Spotify and he was “added to 2,000 playlists and blah, blah, blah – I still haven’t broken 100,000 plays total, and I’ve now removed my highest play count songs”. Therefore, he didn’t feel he had much to lose by boycotting because, in his view, Spotify’s low payout per stream means “it takes over 10 million streams to make minimum wage”. Even though Eve 6 cannot yank its music like Byrnes did, Collins says he is “interested in hurting Spotify as much as possible because that is the only way we will ever wrest fair pay out of them”. Specifically: the band is attempting to change their profile header on the streamer to “delete spotify”. He points out this change is taking the platform “an inordinate amount of time … curious for a company taking an ‘anti-censorship’ stance”. While Eve 6’s methods may seem intense, Byrnes describes labels as “bullying” their artists into being on Spotify. The imprint that distributes all his music prior to 2020, when he began releasing albums himself, has refused his demands to pull those older songs from the streamer. Regardless, the music he has on Spotify and other such streaming platforms makes him merely one-fifth, at most, of what he earns by self-releasing and avoiding label gauging. Byrnes adds: “Spotify and streaming was a bad deal from the start. But we were told we just have to grin and bear it from our labels, because streaming is the future.” Such low offerings for musicians are all the more galling when Rogan is given unprecedented sums by the streaming service, and goes on to uncritically host anti-vax and anti-trans guests. Jennifer Moraca is a scientist in her day job and playing in the band the Odd Birds with a non-binary bandmate. For her, the Rogan podcast rhetoric led to a “breaking point”, despite not “blanket disagreeing with everything” the host and comedian says. She admits that being subsequently compelled to pull her band’s music off Spotify was not a painful decision, because their albums that have been available to stream there for two years only made about $5 – less than one CD sale or a concert’s filled tip jar. Rogan’s licensing deal with Spotify, meanwhile, was worth $100m. Despite his growing infamy, Rogan and co are by no means the only source of misinformation in the streaming game. Jeremy Burchard, the co-founder of both pop-rock band Moonlight Social and a fintech platform called RootNote (designed to help artists better understand their content performance, revenue and growth opportunities), says he was pleased to see Pruitt specifically mention in her tweet “the money she gets per stream from Spotify”. That’s because that conversation becomes “conflated a lot” in his view “and people don’t realize that it’s different for every artist, just one of the many aspects of the current ecosystem that has led to a lot of frustration, confusion, misinformation and general ennui when it comes to specifically promoting your music on streaming platforms.” Since 2018, Moonlight Social earned about $7,500 from the masters side of their music on streaming, while their publishing earnings brought that total closer to $9,000. About half of that sum was from Spotify, which may sound impressive until Burchard says what they pay is “about half of what Apple Music and Amazon pay us”. And while the majority of their listeners are on Spotify, Moonlight Social are “definitely seeing more and more people choosing Apple Music, and Amazon Music to a lesser extent”. Burchard is also encouraged by the promise of other platforms. Patreon, for instance, allows for $5 a month pledges that would each be the equivalent in revenue of a Spotify user streaming an artist 1,500 times a month (the unlikelihood of which Burchard is quick to emphasize). He adds that performing on video livestreamer Twitch can drive major revenue for smaller artists (which he detailed in a recent video). While they are not direct replacements for streaming platforms, Patreon, Twitch and the merch store his band created on Shopify provide artists with huge opportunities, says Burchard. For instance, he adds: “Twitch is about interacting with viewers and providing value by performing and developing community. Spotify is all about volume. Crazy high volume just to get to sustainable revenue.” But when it comes to Spotify, Apple, or even Twitch, “it’s the same story”, according to Peter Tschmuck, professor for Cultural Institutions Studies at the University of Music and Performing Art Vienna. By that, he means they are, above all, “important promotional platforms”. Tschmuck says musicians need these services, especially the ubiquitous Spotify, to be heard, hence the trepidation around boycotts for so many. But as revenue sources, he stops short of calling the platforms “unfair, but it is uneven”. And because the systems of dividing such revenue are so complex – factoring in publishing and distribution, massive cuts for the platforms and labels, greater sums for artists that own their copyrights than those who do not, and much more – Tschmuck says the debate should be equally complex, and will likely remain ongoing. Rather than a definitive turning point, Tschmuck sees the current artist solidarity with Young as a chapter following many others, be it British MPs recently calling for a hard streaming reset to better protect musicians, or Taylor Swift bowing out of Spotify as far back as 2014. As Tschmuck puts it: “This is just another voice in the debate about artists not earning a lot of money from music streaming.”",Arts/Music,‘I wish I could’: why it’s hard for smaller artists to boycott Spotify,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/02/smaller-artists-difficult-boycott-spotify-rogan-young-mitchell
2/2/2022,"The interview begins in uneasy silence, as we stare across at each other from our comfy armchairs. It is not exactly Frost/Nixon, because he is a dog. Being up on the furniture should be a treat for him, but we lost that battle long ago. I repeat my question again: “Why do you bark so much?”  Oz, our Hairy Maclary-like lurcher, tilts his head a little, but remains silent. Perhaps if I were to impersonate a delivery driver and knock on the door, he would speak up. Or if I were to yelp and scream like a fox in the night. Or drive a motorbike past the house. Then he would be in fits of raucous barking loud enough to make the whole neighbourhood shake. At what point is his barking too much? And what can I do to help him tone it down a bit? This is a question many of us are asking, with dog ownership soaring since the start of the pandemic. “Some people can be very intolerant of their dog barking, particular if they are getting complaints from their neighbours,” says Ryan Neile, head of behaviour at the animal welfare charity Blue Cross. I have decided to sit down with Oz to try to work out exactly what his barks are telling me – to listen to his barks and work out what I am missing. So, first, what exactly is a barking dog trying to achieve? Before writing a book about dog cognition, I had lumped barking in a box named “attention-getting device” and left it at that. I had considered a dog’s bark to be a short, sharp “HEY!”, evolved to draw attention to situations in which there is uncertainty – a sudden noise to alert their owner of danger. But now I see that this idea is a bit debasing, because there are many different styles of barking. Oz has a delivery-driver bark, for instance. In the words of dog scientists, the delivery-driver bark is a “harsh, low-frequency, unmodulated” noise – deep and low, in other words. Its deepness tells strangers a story (or lie in this case) of a big dog with a deep chest that probably has sharp teeth, so you had best run away. Oz has another bark for the family when he wants our attention. If, for instance, his ball has rolled underneath the sofa, he opts for a higher pitch. No less loud or urgent, just less … foreboding. He has other barks. Sometimes, when playing, Oz might let out a few quick yaps at other dogs: “Hey! Play!” he seems to say. Often it works; the friendly dogs come over and Oz has lots of fun. So, although it is loud and a bit annoying, I wouldn’t want to deny Oz his natural means of expression. I just want him, occasionally, to tone it down a bit. “Barking is a normal behaviour for dogs, so you can’t expect them not to bark at all,” says Dr Zazie Todd, the author of Wag: The Science of Making Your Dog Happy. She advises exploring the situations in which the dog barks and thinking about the practical solutions. Is it the doorbell? Set up predictable situations, such as having friends over, in which you can teach better behaviour (expect it to take practice and plenty of rewards). Is it when neighbouring cats walk past the window? Try adding a screen to the window. Is it the noise of other dogs barking? Try leaving the radio on. Is it when you leave your dog alone? Build up slowly to such periods, working gradually, with warmth, positivity and (again) lots of treats. “Don’t yell at your dog!” Todd says. So-called “aversive training techniques”, including bark collars, have varying levels of success and don’t tend to solve the underlying issues (including fear) that can be at play in many dogs that bark excessively. As well as the above, Blue Cross’s official advice includes encouraging noisy dogs (through treats, believe it or not) to focus on neutral tasks, such as playing fetch or going to their bed, in situations when their barking becomes problematic. For attention-seeking dogs, barking should never be rewarded with attention – this includes shouting back. In time, your attention becomes a reward dished out only upon calm behaviour. If all else fails, seek help from an accredited animal behaviour expert or a vet. Does the breed have an impact? “Some breeds are much ‘chattier’ than others,” says Holly Root-Gutteridge, a postdoctoral dog researcher at the University of Lincoln. Loud breeds include jack russells, chihuahuas and German shepherds. Quieter breeds include cavalier king charles spaniels, shiba inus and labradors. I notice that Oz, a lurcher, is on the list of quieter dogs, yet he appears to have plenty to say. “Regardless of breeds, some dogs are just big talkers, so it’s good to look at why they’re talking and consider whether it’s related to something we can change,” Root-Gutteridge suggests. “If your dog is barking a lot, there may be a reason that isn’t obvious, like he’s under-exercised or he’s responding to some outside noises that you might not have picked up on.” Oz does bark a bit more in the afternoons, I realise, before we go out for his long walk. Perhaps two medium-sized walks, rather than one longer one, would help? Also, I should probably spend more time playing with his tug-rope in the mornings, once the kids have left for school. I resolve to make a few changes. As I write these words, he looks at me from the sofa, his legs like flagpoles pointing to the ceiling, his woolly head ruffled into the gap between the back of the chair and a cushion. I get up, walk over and gently tickle his tummy. With his adoring eyes and a wag of the tail, he gives me a warm look that says: “Hey!” in a different kind of language. “Hey!” I say back. Finally, I am reading him loud and clear.

2/2/2022,"Today marks the 100th anniversary of the publication of Ulysses, by Paris bookshop Shakespeare and Company. It’s also James Joyce’s birthday; he was born on 2 February 1882 – 140 years ago. Ulysses is contemporary with the Irish Free State, established on 6 December 1922; historians love to pore over its dense, riddling text for clues about the national psyche at the time. The novel and the year have come to be seen as key turning points in Modernism; TS Eliot, whose The Waste Land appeared in December 1922, called Ulysses “a book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape”.  Joyce signed off his text with the words, “Trieste-Zurich-Paris, 1914-1921”. But it is to Dublin we best go if we want to celebrate Ulysses, which put the Irish capital on the map of premier cities of the imagination – beside the likes of Paris and London – and offered readers a detailed plan of the Irish capital in its perambulating plot, which unfolds over a single day. Since 1929, Joyce fans have celebrated Bloomsday on 16 June – the fictional date on which the novel’s events take place, in 1904 – with readings, talks, breakfasts, singing, jigs, reels and fancy dress. In 2020 and 2021, the event, forced to go virtual, was dubbed Zoomsday. This year there will no doubt be a bigger than usual Bloomsday – new films and radio productions are already in train and a themed film festival (bloomsdayfestival.ie) returns for a third time – but there’s also a lot happening in the build-up. There are many ways of taking a Joycean tour around the city. Close readers who like a challenge and a wander set off to trace the book’s clues, shadowing the route taken by protagonist Leopold Bloom, despite the fact many buildings and even entire streets have been demolished. Others follow actual maps prepared by others, tag along behind seasoned tour guides or take bus and bike tours. Some have even taken up Bloom’s challenge: “Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub”. There are 14 brass plaques – laid in the pavement in 1988 – marking out the walk taken by Bloom during the course of the novel; there’s a geocache linked to these. But the other central character, Stephen Dedalus – Joyce’s alter ego – also spends much of the book walking, and the suggested stops below contain some of his route. Ireland’s 50 or so Martello towers, likely named after a tower at Cape Martella in Corsica, were built by the British during the Napoleonic wars. This tower, now a Joyce museum, appears on the first page of Ulysses, with Buck Mulligan having a wet shave while testing his banter on Stephen. The opening lines of the novel are repeated over and over in the film Opening Ulysses, created by Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Museum of Literature Ireland in collaboration with 40 Irish embassies and consulates – a project that perhaps acknowledges many readers don’t get much further than the enigmatic opening. “Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?” wonders Stephen in one of the early stream-of-consciousness sections. Later the same day, Bloom masturbates from the prom while ogling young Gerty MacDowell. This long, broad beach is a place to clear your head before plunging into the labyrinthine novel/city. In the early 1900s this fine Georgian townhouse at 35 North Great George’s Street gave home to a dance academy run by Prof Denis J Maginni, a character who turns up a few times in Ulysses. The building was saved from the wrecking ball by a Joyce scholar. Leopold Bloom’s fictional house at 7 Eccles Street wasn’t so lucky, but the front door of the property is on display here. Due to Covid-19, the centre is currently closed; reopening date tbc. No need to choose too carefully; Ulysses allows plenty of scope for “arsing around from one pub to another”. None of the pubs mentioned in the novel looks anything like they would have done back in the day. Davy Byrnes, which Leopold Bloom deems a “moral pub”, is OK for a pint, though the menu doesn’t feature the gorgonzola sandwich he enjoys with a “good glass of burgundy”. Kennedys on Westland Row, formerly Conways, has hosted Bloomsdays, and claims associations with Oscar Wilde and Samuel Beckett, as well as Joyce. The Oval feels kind of time-honoured and lived-in – though the original was destroyed in the 1916 Easter Rising. This famous bridge over the River Liffey – built between 1791 and 1794 as Carlisle Bridge and renamed in 1882 after Irish political leader Daniel O’Connell – has a starring role in The Dead, the long, final story in Joyce’s Dubliners. The character Gabriel has an epiphany here, realising he must embrace his country’s quest for independence. In Ulysses, Bloom pauses on the bridge to feed seagulls Banbury cakes (currant-filled pastries similar to Eccles cakes). This classical building on Kildare Street, designed by Cork-born Thomas Newenham Deane, dates from 1877. In the Scylla and Charybdis episode, Stephen – who has just given some scholars a lecture on his “biographical” theory about Shakespeare’s Hamlet – and Bloom almost meet in the library entrance. The coffered ceiling of the main reading room, stained glass, reliefs and mosaic floor are worth a look. Branded MoLI for 2022 in homage to Molly Bloom, Joyce’s heroine in Ulysses, and recently reopened to the public, the museum is hosting Love, Says Bloom (2 Feb-3 Jul), an exhibition curated by Nuala O’Connor dedicated to Joyce’s relationship with his wife, Nora Barnacle, their children, Lucia and Giorgio, and grandson Stephen. Until June 2022, the museum is also hosting Suzanne Freeman’s Ulysses, a Treasure Hunt: the episodes of the novel are depicted in a series of small wooden cases dotted around the museum. Copy No. 1 of Ulysses is kept here. Full details of all events can be found at ulysses100.ie. You can’t pay homage to Joyce without popping into a bookseller’s; this independent bookshop at 17 D’Olier Street has itself gone walkabout since opening in 1978, passing from a site above a furrier’s on South King Street, George’s Street Market Arcade and 36 College Green – opposite Trinity College – before settling here. The shop stocks new and secondhand editions of Joyce’s works and has a cafe. Consuming Joyce (Bloomsbury), a new book by John McCourt, analyses, among other things, why we go on pilgrimages instead of reading James Joyce. Death is a key motif in Ulysses. Stephen is mourning his mother’s passing. Bloom is on the way to Paddy Dignam’s funeral at this large cemetery north west of the city centre. The tomb of drowning victim Matthew F Kane says he was the “model for Patrick Dignam” and four other people in the novel. While Joyce was writing Ulysses, the great influenza pandemic of 1918-1920 was slaying millions. In the Hades episode of the novel, Bloom muses: “Whooping cough … Only measles … Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don’t miss this chance”. Thinking as an advertising agent, he imagines the rival plagues as travelling salesmen, bidding for business (ie bodies). This beautiful peninsula to the north east of Dublin has special significance in Ulysses. Bloom proposed to Molly here. Howth is also a prompt in Molly’s final soliloquy, when she recalls why she loves him (“yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes”). Dublin is where Bloom is forced to confront the fact he is a cuckold. For hope and faith, you have to leave the metropolis behind, go to the edge, study the sea.",Lifestyle/Travel,In the footsteps of giants: the ultimate Ulysses walk around Dublin,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/feb/02/james-joyce-tour-the-ultimate-ulysses-walk-around-dublin
2/2/2022,"The early release from prison of a white Chicago police officer who was sentenced to about seven years for the murder of a Black teenager in 2014 has sparked anger among relatives, community organizers and politicians who are questioning the decision to shave three years off his sentence for ‘good behavior’.  Jason Van Dyke, who was convicted of murder in 2018, was sentenced to six years and nine months for the murder of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, after video showed Van Dyke shooting the teenager 16 times. Van Dyke is now set to be released on 3 February, almost three years ahead of schedule. He will remain on parole for at least two years. Members of McDonald’s family, local activists and political leaders have voiced their fury over Van Dyke’s early release, noting that he served just a fraction of the 18 years prosecutors originally sought, let alone the maximum 96 years Van Dyke could have received for his charges. In a press conference last Thursday held by McDonald’s relatives at a local church, his grandmother, Tracie Hunter, called Van Dyke’s punishment a “slap on the wrist”, according to the Chicago Tribune. “I just want justice, the right justice,” Hunter said. “I’m not going to rest or be satisfied until this man does his rightful time.” “It’s crazy how I go to a cemetery and talk to a tombstone while this man can talk to his wife and two kids,” said Tanesha Hunter, McDonald’s aunt, in a separate press conference on Monday. Local activists have led several protests over the past week, including a rally outside Illinois governor JB Pritzker’s home last Friday. A number of actions are planned for Thursday, when Van Dyke will be released. “He represents all the officers who we could not hold accountable, or that the justice system has not held accountable yet,” community organizer William Calloway told the Chicago Tribune, listing other people killed by Chicago police officers including 29-year-old Flint Farmer in 2011, 15-year-old Dakota Bright in 2012, 15-year-old Michael Westley in 2013, and 19-year-old Roshad McIntosh and 25-year old Ronald Johnson III in 2014. The Reverend Jesse Jackson said he is also organizing a march for Thursday and has joined other organizers in calling for the justice department to pursue federal civil rights crimes against Van Dyke. A federal investigation was opened in 2015 but charges were never filed. “We all know that 81 months is not enough to fully hold Van Dyke accountable and we know that there is a movement in this city. That is the reason why Van Dyke is behind bars, so we are reactivating that movement,” Jazmine Salas of the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, one of the organizations that signed a letter to the Department of Justice asking for federal charges, told WTTW. Pritzker himself has been critical of Van Dyke’s shortened sentence, saying last Friday that he was “disappointed” in the outcome. “The justice system isn’t always just, and I do not think that the outcome of sentencing of Jason Van Dyke was proper,” the governor said. “I am disappointed and I would have rather seen a different outcome. But this is where we are.” Backlash against Van Dyke’s release has been magnified by Chicago’s shaky record on police reform after McDonald’s murder and more police-involved shootings since, despite a consent decree mandating reform. The decree was issued after a blistering justice department investigation into the Chicago police department found excessive, racist force and widespread corruption. “We are not where we want to be when it comes to police reform and accountability, but we are further along in two-plus years of doing this work than any other city that has been under consent decree,” said the Chicago mayor, Lori Lightfoot. Jamie Kalven, the investigative journalist who broke the Laquan McDonald story and founded the non-profit Invisible Institute, told ABC7 Chicago that despite “discernible progress in some discrete areas, we have thus far failed and our institutions have failed to really rise to that challenge”. “The verdict is far more important than the sentence, and I’m not sure we’d be in a different place as a city right now if Jason Van Dyke had gotten 12 years or 20 years,” said Kalven. In October 2014, Van Dyke and another officer responded to calls of a teenager carrying a knife and allegedly damaging cars in the South Side area of Chicago. Within six seconds of exiting his police vehicle, Van Dyke shot McDonald 16 times as the teenager was walking away. Many of the bullets hit McDonald as he fell to the ground. Three other police officers, all acquitted of any charges but ultimately fired from the department in 2019, filed false police reports accusing McDonald of lunging towards officers with a knife and failing to interview eyewitnesses who saw the shooting. Discrepancies in their accounts were only uncovered once dash cam footage from Van Dyke’s car showing McDonald’s murder was released. The murder sparked nationwide protests and global coverage. Many accused then mayor Rahm Emanuel, who was recently confirmed as US ambassador to Japan, of a coverup ahead of his reelection campaign in 2015, after video of the shooting was withheld for more than a year.",News/US news,Fury over early release of Chicago officer convicted of Black teenager’s murder,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/01/chicago-police-officer-early-release-murder-black-teenager
2/2/2022,"When my mother died recently, I’d budgeted for the funeral costs. What I had not budgeted for were the fees of the parish council which operates the only graveyard available. I was charged £2,000 for what was, effectively, permission to inter my mother in a plot we had already bought for my father, who died 40 years ago. The fee doesn’t include grave digging, and there’s a further £230 for permission to add my mother’s name to the headstone. It’s especially unfair because we are being discriminated against for living on the wrong side of a town that happens to be divided into two parishes, Oxted and Limpsfield. When my father died in 1981, there was no room in the Limpsfield cemetery, so we paid £40 for a 100-year lease on a plot at Oxted, a mile from my parents’ house. Twenty years later, Oxted parish council decided to charge residents of Limpsfield parish triple the interment rate in Oxted.  If my mother had lived a few hundred yards away, over the parish boundary, it would have been £600.NG, Limpsfield, Surrey Interment charges levied by local authorities and parish councils are uncapped and unregulated and can dwarf the cost of a funeral director. One London borough charges £10,000 for people from outside the council’s jurisdiction. It’s reasonable for new plots to reflect the cost of land, its maintenance and popular demand. And a charging system that helps preserve cemeteries for local ratepayers makes sense. However, it’s extraordinary that those charges apply to someone joining their spouse in a plot already leased by the family. It seems especially unfair, given that the price differential was introduced years after you buried your father and, that, since your local cemetery is full, you say you had no other option. Most councils make exceptions for partners who have been forced to move out of the area, but your argument that this should apply to your mother’s situation held no sway at Oxted. It told the Observer that its fees were reviewed annually and were lower for parishioners who paid for the upkeep of the cemetery through a council tax precept. “Fees are in line with those of many other parish councils, and the same for a first interment or a subsequent one,” it says. According to the Institute of Cemetery And Crematorium Management (ICCM), the organisation that owns the burial ground can set its own fee and there’s no national guidance on what it can be. Since these organisations can be local authorities, private companies, charitable trusts, religious organisations or parish councils, they can vary wildly. “Many local authorities charge a discounted fee for residents, as they may have contributed to the provision and upkeep of the cemetery through the rates and/or council tax system,” says ICCM. “Non residents are charged more, as they haven’t made this contribution. This can seem unfair, particularly when a cemetery is very close, but isn’t actually in the same authority area.” Fees are likely to outstrip inflation as the provision of new cemeteries is not keeping up with demand. Labour MP for Mitcham and Morden, Siobhain McDonagh, raised the issue in the Commons after a constituent, who had moved out of area, incurred a non-resident fee of nearly £4,000 to be buried in the family grave. “No bereaved family should be faced with the burden of having to shop around for the best deal, but across the country the cost of burials and cremations varies significantly,” she told the Observer. “Even within boroughs, non-residents can be charged up to quadruple the costs, regardless of how long they had lived there. This outrageous exploitation of grief urgently needs to change.” Burials come under the remit of the Ministry of Justice, which says that burial authorities can charge such fees they think proper.

2/2/2022,"Poorer, urban areas in England are the least likely to have protected local green spaces, despite the fact they need them the most, the first analysis of its kind has found. To “level up”, local parks in urban areas need to be given the same protections as national parks, CPRE, the countryside charity, has said.  Important small local parks, at an average size of 1.8 hectares (4.5 acres), can be protected from development by applying to the council for them to be designated as local green spaces (LGS). Local green spaces are small parcels of land, close to where people live, that are demonstrably special to their community, for reasons that can include their beauty, historic significance, recreational value, tranquillity or richness of wildlife. It is a neighbourhood planning tool with unique power, because it implies being valued by local people is in itself a strong enough reason to protect small patches of green space. However, while more than 6,500 have been created across the country since 2012, when the designation was introduced, hardly any of these are in deprived, urban areas, and the majority are concentrated in wealthy parts of the south-east. While there are 5.9 local green spaces per 100,000 people in the north, people in the south-east enjoy 11.9. Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool are among the cities with no designated local green spaces. Predominantly rural local authority areas account for 55% of LGS designations, despite the fact those who live there have far greater access to nature than their urban counterparts. Only 38% of the 100 local councils with the most green space-deprived neighbourhoods have at least one designated LGS. A report by CPRE calls for the government to introduce compulsory standards for access to nature into planning law and policy and to add an indicator on access to nature to the index of multiple deprivation to help facilitate easier access to nature for all. Crispin Truman, the chief executive of CPRE, said: “This is a solution to levelling up that has been hiding in plain sight; a planning superpower in the hands of ordinary people. All that people have to prove is they use and value the land for it to be eligible to be protected like it’s a national park. “Unfortunately, there is a sliding scale of injustice when it comes to who is benefiting. Put simply, the poorer you are and the more nature-deprived your neighbourhood already is, the less likely you are to have any protected local green space. It’s time to address this imbalance and level up everyone’s access to nature. “That is why we’re calling on the government to promise the equivalent of a national park for every neighbourhood. Local green space designation is a powerful way to protect vulnerable slices of nature, particularly in deprived areas. It has the added benefit of nurturing neighbourhood planning groups so that people get more of a say in what gets built locally. “Our iconic national parks are rightly celebrated and protected. But research repeatedly shows they are not accessible to all – and that the poorest in society benefit the least. That’s why it should be a national priority to protect our local parks and green spaces so that everybody, no matter where they live, has access to the benefits of nature.”",News/Cities,"England’s poor urban areas have fewest protected green spaces, analysis finds",https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2022/feb/02/englands-poor-urban-areas-have-fewest-protected-green-spaces-analysis-finds
2/2/2022,"Remember normcore? Back in 2014, a far more innocent time, a bunch of friends coined the term as tongue-in-cheek social commentary. It was supposed to describe a “post-authenticity coolness that opts in to sameness”. A journalist got wind of the word and published a piece describing the trend in rather more user-friendly terms – ie all the cool kids are wearing sensible shoes and dressing like Jerry Seinfeld. Suddenly, normcore was everywhere. New York magazine declared Pope Francis “our normcore Pope”. Vogue crowned the Duchess of Cambridge “the Duchess of Normcore”. Nobody seemed to really care what normcore actually meant; they just liked saying it. For good reason: it’s a strangely satisfying word. Normcore eventually faded from the headlines but it didn’t entirely disappear. “-core” became the new “-gate”: irresistible linguistic Lego that you could attach to almost anything. Cottagecore had a moment. So did Regencycore, warcore, gorpcore, pearlcore, Covidcore, goblincore and mushroomcore. Blimey.  Long story short: there have been a bunch of rotten cores over the years. Almost too many to choose from, really. However, I have been staying au courant with the issue and I reckon I’ve found the worst iteration yet: “Kidcore”. According to a recent piece in the Wall Street Journal, that noted chronicler of the cutting edge, it’s very hot right now. Per the Journal: “Kidcore – a fad that sees adult men conjure their tweenage years with expressive, if juvenile, outfits – has thrived during the pandemic” and may be the big men’s fashion trend of 2022. Well, I’m certainly glad something thrived during the pandemic. Still. Please can we cut the -cores already? Eight years is a very long time for a gag to go on. Even I retire my jokes sooner than that.

2/2/2022,"When eight-year-old Dillon Helbig finished writing his book, The Adventures of Dillon Helbig’s Crismis, in mid-December, he wanted everyone to read it. The only problem was that he did not have an agent. So he decided to self-publish. During a visit with his grandmother to the Lake Hazel branch of the Ada Community Library in Boise, Idaho, Dillon quietly deposited his book, signed “by Dillon His Self”, on to a nearby shelf.  “I always be sneaky, like how I get chocolate,” Dillon told the KTVB television station about the undercover operation. “There was a lot of librarians that I had to sneak past so do you know what I did? I covered up this part and covered the back with my body and just snuck it in and then started to walk, and then I came in this aisle – no, wait, this aisle – and then I put my book right here. Wait, right here.” The 81-page book details adventures that ensue after the star on a Christmas tree Dillon is decorating explodes. Dillon is transported into a portal and time-travels to the very first Thanksgiving and to the north pole. “Everything about it was a bit crazy,” the second-grader admitted. Days later, when Dillon came to check on the book, he noticed it was gone. His mom called the library. “His parents were worried we would find his book and we would get rid of it,” the Lake Hazel library branch manager, Alex Hartman, said. “Which was an unfounded fear because if there’s ever a place a book would be safe, it would be here.” It turned out that Hartman and his colleagues discovered Dillon’s book in the “stories” section and read it, including to Hartman’s six-year-old son. “Dillon’s book definitely fit all the criteria that we would look for to include a book in our collection,” Hartman said. And so, with Dillon’s permission, the library stickered and catalogued the book and placed it with its holdings of graphic novels for adults, teens and kids. As of Saturday, The Adventures of Dillon Helbig’s Crismis was subject to a 55-person wait list. Hartman has been in discussion with Dillon’s mother about creating a digital copy. “We’re just hoping that … children find inspiration to write their own stories and share those with other people,” Hartman told the Washington Post. “I just think it’s a good demonstration to share with other kids.” Dillon has been awarded the library’s Whoodini Award for best young novelist, a category created for him and named after the library’s owl mascot. The young author has announced that a sequel is in the works, this time about a visit from the Grinch and also featuring Dillon’s dog, Rusty. He is also writing a book about a jacket-eating closet, based, Dillon said, on a true story from his kindergarten days.",Arts/Books,Book a prize: Idaho library has wait list for story eight-year-old hid on a shelf,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/02/boy-handrwritten-book-dillon-helbig-idaho
2/2/2022,"Shweeeee … Boooom. The noise of the exploding artillery shell startled me awake in the middle of a July night. Dazed, I stumbled out of bed and tried to check on the other journalists with whom I share a dormitory. As we ran outside, another shell flew overhead. It was five months after the military takeover in Myanmar and three months since we had been forced to relocate from the Kachin state capital, Myitkyina, to territory held by a group known in Myanmar as an ethnic armed organisation (EAO), fighting for self-determination for an ethnic minority state near Myanmar’s border with China. Now this territory was being bombed. We were all terrified; some of my staff were crying as they looked to me for guidance and comfort.  This was neither our first nor last brush with danger. Since the military seized power on 1 February 2021, small local media outlets such as mine have faced immense risks and hardships just to survive. In February 2021, Myanmar's progress towards democracy was brutally stalled when the military seized power and took control of the country.   In the year since, the country has been plunged into violence, poverty and mass displacement as the military attempts to crush widespread resistance to its rule.  Internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, a ruthless curtailing of freedom of speech and escalating military attacks on civilian areas have silenced the voices of people from Myanmar.   For this special series, the Guardian’s Rights and freedom project has partnered with a diverse group of journalists from Myanmar, many working in secret, to bring their reporting on life under military rule to a global audience. Journalists in Myanmar are working in dangerous and difficult circumstances, as the military government attacks the free press and shuts down local media outlets. Many reporters still inside the country fear arrest, with others forced to leave their homes and go into hiding in areas increasingly under attack from military forces.  All the reporting in this series will be carried out by journalists from Myanmar, with support from the editors on the Rights and freedom project. These are the stories that journalists from Myanmar want to tell about what is happening to their country at this critical moment. Just two weeks after the coup, I was one of the first journalists that the military arrested as it attempted to cover up its violent suppression of the pro-democracy movement. We were taking live-stream footage of the military’s violent suppression of a demonstration in Myitkyina, when soldiers fired rubber bullets to disperse protesters. Police and soldiers arrested me and four other local reporters. Just moments before they confiscated our camera gear and mobile phones, we filmed a soldier giving the order: “Arrest everyone filming.” We were lucky. After being held for the night we were released without charge. Yet since then the military has arrested at least 110 more journalists, of whom 44 remained in detention as of 10 January. Recently, three journalists were killed. One of them, Soe Naing, died during interrogation by the military after he was arrested on 10 December while filming a protest in Yangon. After our arrest, we immediately resumed reporting, but our space to work as journalists was rapidly narrowing. I was constantly followed by investigative police, and after they tracked down our office address, my whole team was put under surveillance. On 28 February, another of our journalists was arrested. He says he was strip-searched before being released eight hours later. On 7 March, we locked up our offices and went into hiding. Our challenges were compounded when the military blocked mobile data across the country on 15 March, leaving us dependent on finding places with wifi to carry out our work. On 29 March a female journalist from my team was arrested while covering a protest. She says that during her six-month detention she spent a week in an interrogation centre where she was subjected to psychological torture. Arrest warrants were also issued for several other members of my staff in April. That same month, as the military continued to crack down on the press, we realised that we were likely to become more of a target and we finally decided to relocate to the Chinese border. A month after we left, the military revoked our media licence. Since then we have been staying in the territory of one of more than a dozen EAOs that line Myanmar’s borders. Some of them have been fighting for self-determination for decades; since the coup, some have at times joined forces with new armed pro-democracy groups against the military. In our new location, we no longer fear being tailed incessantly by the military or the constant threat of arrest, but we face a new set of worries. Since our arrival, conflict has been escalating between the military and armed revolutionary groups across the country, and at times attacks near our location seem imminent. We have heard artillery fire several times, and have bags ready in case we need to flee in an emergency. But there are few places we could seek shelter. We cannot safely go back to the city, but a three-metre-high fence, topped with barbed wire and CCTV cameras, stops us from being able to cross the border into China. Although we are grateful to the EAO for allowing us to stay in its territory, we also have limited media freedom. Journalists and editors have received verbal warnings that action will be taken against us if we report on issues in a way they do not like. Nonetheless, we continue to report on the serious human rights violations and lawless behaviour of the Myanmar military in Kachin state and neighbouring areas. A year after the coup, the military continues to egregiously restrict media freedoms across the country and attempts to terrorise journalists into silence. Nearly all the journalists who were working in Myitkyina before the coup have fled. Many are unable to continue reporting at all. My team has made it this far, and we remain committed to keeping our newsroom alive whatever risks lie ahead.

2/2/2022,"Arnima Hayat has been remembered as a “noble child from a noble family” after the aspiring doctor was allegedly murdered by her partner, Meraj Zafar, in Sydney’s west. Arnima’s body was found by police in a bathtub of chemicals at her home on Pennant Hills Road in North Parramatta about 4.30pm on Sunday, sparking a manhunt for her 20-year-old partner.  Zafar turned himself in at Bankstown police station on Monday before being arrested and charged with her murder. Arnima, 19, was in her second year of medicine at university with dreams of becoming a surgeon, her parents told Channel Seven. Abu and Mahafuza Hayat, originally from Bangladesh, said their daughter “wanted to help people”. “Everyone hoped she’d become a big doctor,” father Abu said. “I want my daughter, I love my daughter.” Mahafuza sobbed as she spoke. “My daughter’s not coming,” she said. Canterbury Bankstown councillor ​Sazeda Akter described Arnima as an “angel” and a “noble child”. “We have lost a young soul within our community, someone who I have seen grow up in front of my eyes,” Akter wrote on Facebook. “A noble child from a noble family. It breaks my heart to see how things have transpired.” Arnima and her partner moved into the apartment late last year, according to neighbours who spoke to Channel Nine. Prieta Mamun, a Bangladeshi Australian influencer and online makeup retailer, remembers connecting online with “hype girl” Arnima in 2020. “She was very kind and supportive of outfits that I would wear and my style and the fact that I was Bengali like her,” Prieta told the Guardian. “She was a self care kind of girl. She would love getting her nails done, she loved false eyelashes.” Prieta was devastated when she heard Arnima had allegedly been killed by her partner. “It’s just excruciating,” she said. “I was just very shocked and really just defeated and exhausted.” Speaking on Monday, Parramatta police Supt Julie Boon said it was hard for the officers who found Arnima, after her family called authorities with concerns for her welfare. “I can confirm there were chemicals found inside the bathroom of the unit,” she said. “The scene was very challenging for arriving police. When they did arrive and found chemicals at the unit, they retreated and called other units.” ​​A truck, believed to belong to accused killer Zafar, was seized in Greenacre for forensic examination. Zafar did not appear in person or via video link in Bankstown local court on Tuesday when his matter was mentioned before magistrate Shane McAnulty. Police allege he murdered Arnima between Saturday and Sunday, according to court documents. Zafar’s lawyer Mohamad Sakr told reporters outside court he did not know if his client would fight the charges. “He’s distraught about being in custody,” he said. “It’s just a matter of whether he wishes to fight these charges or not, but I will take those instructions and advise accordingly.” Zafar did not apply for bail and is due to appear again on 5 April.",News/Australia news,Family and friends mourn lost ‘angel’ and aspiring doctor Arnima Hayat,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/02/family-and-friends-mourn-lost-angel-and-aspiring-doctor-arnima-hayat
