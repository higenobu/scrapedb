4/16/2022,"Ukrainian police said the bodies of more than 900 civilians have been found in the areas outside capital of Kyiv, the Associated Press reported. Kyiv regional police chief Andriy Nebytov it appears that the majority of them were ""simply executed."" The harrowing discovery was made after Russian forces withdrew from the area around Kyiv. Ukrainian police said on Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians have been found in the areas outside Ukraine's capital of Kyiv — and that it appears many of them were ""simply executed"" by Russian troops. Kyiv regional police chief Andriy Nebytov said that the bodies were discovered strewn in the streets in the region surrounding the capital or in temporary burial plots, the Associated Press reported. Citing police data, Nebytov said that 95% of the slain civilians died from gunshot wounds, according to the news outlet. ""We understand that under the [Russian] occupation, people were simply executed in the streets,"" Nebytov said, adding that the death toll is expected to rise as more bodies are found daily under debris and in mass graves, according to the AP. The harrowing discovery was made after Russian forces withdrew from the area around Kyiv after several weeks of war with the eastern European country in which Russian troops failed to capture the capital. Nebytov said more than 350 bodies were found in the Ukrainian town of Bucha alone, the AP reported. Additionally, Nebytov said that utility workers in Bucha buried bodies in the Kyiv suburb when it was under Russian control and said Russian troops were ""tracking down"" people with pro-Ukrainian views, according to the AP. Earlier this month, gruesome scenes of dead civilians emerged out of Bucha, sparking international outrage.

4/16/2022,"Zelenskyy said he is frustrated with Western leaders repeatedly asking for his wishlist of weaponry for Ukraine. ""It's 'Groundhog Day.' I feel like Bill Murray,"" Zelenskyy told The Atlantic in an interview. He added that Ukraine has offered to help facilitate weapons shipments to ensure they come more quickly. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he is tired of Western leaders repeatedly asking him for a wishlist of weapons for Ukraine. In an interview published Friday with The Atlantic, Zelenskyy said he is often frustrated by repetitive questions asked of him by Western leaders. ""It's not interesting to answer the questions you already heard,"" Zelenskyy said, according to The Atlantic. ""When some leaders ask me what weapons I need, I need a moment to calm myself, because I already told them the week before,"" he continued. ""It's 'Groundhog Day.' I feel like Bill Murray."" Nevertheless, Zelenskyy repeats his wishlist, hoping to receive support in the form of weaponry from Western allies, The Atlantic reported. He said that he has even offered to fly up to three Ukrainian cargo planes to pick up weapons from other countries. ""You have it and here it is; we know where it is stored. Can you give it to us?"" Zelenskyy said, according to The Atlantic. ""We need armored vehicles, for example. And not one per day. We need 200 to 300 per day. These aren't personal taxis, just for me; our soldiers need transport. Flights are available, the whole thing can be organized, we can do all the logistics."" He acknowledged that shipments of weaponry may be stalled because leaders of other countries across the world cannot understand the immediacy with which Ukraine needs the shipments, The Atlantic reported. ""They are not against us. They just live in a different situation. As long as they have not lost their parents and children, they do not feel the way we feel,"" Zelenskyy said. Zelenskyy's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, noted that working with the US has been pleasant and complimented President Joe Biden's efforts, but said the weapons shipments just aren't coming fast enough to keep up with the Russian assault on their country.

4/16/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) -One of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies warned NATO on Thursday that if Sweden and Finland joined the U.S.-led military alliance then Russia would deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in a European exclave. Finland, which shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia, and Sweden are considering joining the NATO alliance. Finland will decide in the next few weeks, Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on Wednesday. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said that should Sweden and Finland join NATO then Russia would have to strengthen its land, naval and air forces in the Baltic Sea. Medvedev also explicitly raised the nuclear threat by saying that there could be no more talk of a ""nuclear free"" Baltic - where Russia has its Kaliningrad exclave sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. ""There can be no more talk of any nuclear–free status for the Baltic - the balance must be restored,"" said Medvedev, who was Russian president from 2008 to 2012. Medvedev said he hoped Finland and Sweden would see sense. If not, he said, they would have to live with nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles close to home. When asked how Washington views the potential addition of Sweden and Finland to NATO in light of Russia's warning, the U.S. State Department said there was no change in Washington's position and repeated that ""NATO's open door is an open door."" ""Without speaking to any countries in particular, we would not be concerned that the expansion of a defensive alliance would do anything other than promote stability on the European continent,"" Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a briefing. Russia has the world's biggest arsenal of nuclear warheads and along with China and the United States is one of the global leaders in hypersonic missile technology. Lithuania said Russia's threats were nothing new and that Moscow had deployed nuclear weapons to Kaliningrad long before the war in Ukraine. NATO did not immediately respond to Russia's warning. Still, the possible accession of Finland and Sweden into NATO - founded in 1949 to provide Western security against the Soviet Union - would be one of the biggest strategic consequences of the war in Ukraine. Finland gained independence from Russia in 1917 and fought two wars against it during World War Two during which it lost some territory. On Thursday, Finland announced a military exercise in western Finland with the participation of Britain, the United States, Latvia and Estonia. Sweden has not fought a war for 200 years. Foreign policy has focused on supporting democracy and nuclear disarmament. KALININGRAD Kaliningrad, formerly the port of Koenigsberg, capital of East Prussia, lies less than 1,400 km from London and Paris and 500 km from Berlin. Russia said in 2018 it had deployed Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad, which was captured by the Red Army in April 1945 and ceded to the Soviet Union at the Potsdam conference. The Iskander, known as SS-26 Stone by NATO, is a short-range tactical ballistic missile system that can carry nuclear warheads. Its official range is 500 km but some Western military sources suspect it may be much greater. ""No sane person wants higher prices and higher taxes, increased tensions along borders, Iskanders, hypersonics and ships with nuclear weapons literally at arm's length from their own home,"" Medvedev said. ""Let's hope that the common sense of our northern neighbours will win."" While Putin is Russia's paramount leader, Medvedev's comments reflect Kremlin thinking and he is a senior member of the security council - one of Putin's main chambers for decision making on strategic issues. Lithuanian Defence Minister Arvydas Anusauskas said Russia had deployed nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad even before the war. ""Nuclear weapons have always been kept in Kaliningrad ... the international community, the countries in the region, are perfectly aware of this,"" Anusauskas was quoted as saying by BNS. ""They use it as a threat."" Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced millions and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States - by far the world's two biggest nuclear powers. Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the persecution of Russian-speaking people. Ukraine says it is fighting an imperial-style land grab and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense. U.S. President Joe Biden says Putin is a war criminal and a dictator. Putin says the conflict in Ukraine as part of a much broader confrontation with the United States which he says is trying to enforce its hegemony even as its dominance over the international order declines.

4/16/2022,"LONDON — As the Russia-Ukraine war entered its eighth week, Russia confirmed that its flagship vessel in the Black Sea sank — with Ukrainians crediting their anti-ship missile for the action — while CIA Director William Burns warned that the U.S. can’t “take lightly” the possibility that Russia would use nuclear weapons. Moscow’s Defense Ministry confirmed on Thursday that the Moskva, Russia’s leading battleship in the country’s naval assault against Ukraine, sank while being towed to port during a storm. “While being towed ... towards the destination port, the vessel lost its balance due to damage sustained in the hull as fire broke out after ammunition exploded. Given the choppy seas, the vessel sank,” Russian state news agency Tass reported, quoting the ministry’s statement. Moscow initially said a “fire” set off some of its weapons and that “ammunition exploded on board” as a result. Officials said the crew, believed to include around 500 sailors, was safely evacuated from the burning ship. The ministry said the fire is now under investigation. However, the governor of Odesa claimed the damage was a result of a Ukrainian missile strike on Wednesday — which Moscow has denied. Russia’s military setbacks in the war against Ukraine could lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin using low-yield, or tactical, nuclear weapons, William Burns, the director of the CIA, warned on Thursday. Speaking at Georgia Tech, in Atlanta, Burns said: “Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they’ve faced so far, militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons.” Burns added that the CIA has been watching the Kremlin “very intently” but said the U.S. had yet to see any signs that Putin was preparing to use those weapons. Russia has had nuclear forces on high alert since its invasion began on Feb. 24. Russia’s Defense Ministry pledged on Friday to launch more strikes against Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, following the loss of the Moskva battleship. “The number and scale of missile strikes on targets in Kyiv will increase in response to any terrorist attacks or acts of sabotage on Russian territory committed by the Kyiv nationalist regime,” the ministry said in a statement. A military factory in Kyiv that allegedly produced the Neptune missiles that Ukraine claimed it used to strike the Moskva was targeted overnight on Thursday. In a diplomatic note to the Biden administration, Russia warned the U.S. that there would be “unpredictable consequences” if Washington keeps sending military assistance to Ukraine. “We call on the United States and its allies to stop the irresponsible militarization of Ukraine, which implies unpredictable consequences for regional and international security,” the note said, according to the Washington Post. On Wednesday, President Biden authorized $800 million in military assistance for Ukraine. The shipment will include a wide range of weapons, including helicopters and Switchblade armed drones, as well as medical equipment. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged European countries to stop buying Russian oil that provides “blood” money to the Putin regime. Speaking to the BBC in an interview published on Thursday, Zelensky criticized Hungary and Germany for preventing an oil embargo. “We don’t understand how you can make money out of blood,” he said. “Unfortunately, this is what some countries have been doing, European countries.” The Ukrainian leader added: “Some of our friends and partners understand that it is a different time now, that it is no longer an issue of business and money. That it is an issue of survival.” At least 503 people in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region have been killed since the invasion began on Feb. 24, the local governor, Oleg Synegubov, said this week. Writing on the social media app Telegram, he said the dead included 24 children. _____",World/Yahoo News,Russia-Ukraine war latest: Key Russian vessel sinks as CIA warns about Putin's potential use of nuclear weapons,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-ukraine-war-latest-key-russian-vessel-sinks-as-cia-warns-about-putins-potential-use-of-nuclear-weapons-134659324.html
