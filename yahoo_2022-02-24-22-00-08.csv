2/24/2022,"On Wednesday afternoon, just hours before Vladimir Putin launched a long-planned attack on Ukraine, a top White House official joined Yahoo Finance Live to preview the planned sanctions against Russia. Daleep Singh, White House Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics, underlined that the plan will be wide-ranging — and that crucial American economic allies will be on board to make the measures stick. His comments echo those made by White House press secretary Jen Psaki during her daily briefing on Wednesday afternoon. “What people need to understand is that we follow a set of guiding principles when we think about sanctions,” said Singh, who also serves as Deputy Director of the National Economic Council. “We're not cowboys applying arbitrary and capricious sanctions to the rest of the world.” President Joe Biden will provide more details early Thursday afternoon in a speech to the nation. In a statement Wednesday night, Biden said, “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way.” On energy spikes as a result of the war, Singh underlined that American consumers will face higher prices — but he said the costs to Russia will be much higher. Russia is the world's second-largest producer of natural gas and third-largest producer of crude oil. Singh said the U.S. sanctions wouldn't be designed to stop Russia oil exports — rather, cutting off the spigot there would be Putin’s choice. “It would be a terrible mistake for Russia to weaponize its oil supply,” he said. ""[Russia] depends on oil and gas revenues for its exports and for the Russian government's budget revenues.” If gas prices do spike more, one option would be releasing more oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to alleviate prices, Psaki noted Wednesday. The sanctions to come are also set to focus largely on Russian finances — with more Russian financial institutions set to be targeted — as well as limits on the country's imports. For weeks, the Biden administration has suggested it could deploy export controls. Those controls would aim to ban foreign and domestic companies from sending Russia sought-after products like high-tech semiconductors. Speaking to Yahoo Finance on Wednesday, Singh attempted to address a key question about those proposed sanctions. Can the White House actually exert influence in this area when 100% of the world’s most advanced semiconductors are manufactured overseas? Indeed, three-quarters of global chip manufacturing capacity is now concentrated in East Asia. The rules “can only work in tandem with our allies and partners in Europe, but also in Asia,"" Singh acknowledged. “We know almost all of the leading-edge semiconductor chips are produced in Taiwan and Korea and what this rule allows us to do is to move in lockstep with our European partners as well as our Asian partners.” While U.S.-based companies like Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM) would fall directly under the controls, the focus in the coming weeks and months will likely be on whether companies like Samsung (based in South Korea) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company comply. The overall plan, says Singh, is “what we'll create is a negative feedback loop, a vicious feedback loop between capital outflows, a weaker currency, imported inflation, higher imported inflation, a hit to Russia's purchasing power, lower investment, and lower growth.” Ben Werschkul is a writer and producer for Yahoo Finance in Washington, DC.

2/24/2022,"A Florida restaurant forced servers to work ""for tips alone"" by not paying them wages, the DOL said. Rosy's Mexican Restaurant also didn't give other staff an overtime premium, the DOL said. It violated child-labor laws by letting a minor work late during a school week, per the DOL. A Florida restaurant didn't pay wages to servers, forcing them to work ""for tips alone,"" a US Department of Labor investigation found. E & E Quezada Food Services, operator of Rosy's Mexican Restaurant in Jacksonville, ""failed to pay its servers any wages, forcing them to rely on customer tips as their sole compensation,"" the labor department said in a press release Wednesday. Rosy's also failed to pay dishwashers, cooks, and some servers an overtime premium when they worked more than 40 hours in a week, according to the DOL. It also didn't keep accurate payroll or shift records. The DOL said that the restaurant owed 10 workers a combined $118,042 in back wages and liquidated damages. ""By denying servers a cash wage and forcing them to live on tips alone and denying other workers their overtime pay, Rosy's Mexican Restaurant made it harder for these employees, who depend on every dollar, to take care of themselves and their families,"" Wildalí De Jesús, director at the Orlando office of the DOL's Wage and Hour Division, said in the press release. The case offers an insight into the conditions experienced by some workers in hospitality, a sector that has witnessed record staff outflows. Millions of restaurant workers quit their jobs during the pandemic because of low wages, lack of benefits, and poor working conditions. It has prompted some restaurants to offer improved wages and benefits to recruit and retain staff. Some former hospitality staff have returned to education, taken early retirement, and flocked to better-paying jobs in other industries. Rosy's also let a 15-year-old work after 7 p.m. during the school week, according to the DOL, which, it said, was a violation of child-labor laws under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Florida's minimum wage is currently $10 an hour. Under state law, restaurants have to pay workers a minimum of $6.98 an hour, provided staff earn at least $3.02 an hour in tips. Rosy's did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment, made outside of normal working hours.

2/24/2022,"Sen. Mitt Romney laid the blame for Russia’s Wednesday night invasion of Ukraine at the policies of the three most recent U.S. presidents, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden. ""Putin’s Ukraine invasion is the first time in 80 years that a great power has moved to conquer a sovereign nation. It is without justification, without provocation and without honor,"" Romney said in a statement. BIDEN RESPONDS TO RUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE: 'THE WORLD WILL HOLD RUSSIA ACCOUNTABLE' ""Putin’s impunity predictably follows our tepid response to his previous horrors in Georgia and Crimea, our naive efforts at a one-sided ‘reset,’ and the shortsidedness of ‘America First,'"" the 2012 Republican presidential nominee added. ""The '80s called and we didn’t answer,"" Romney said. The Republican also criticized the current U.S. foreign policy. ""The peril of again looking away from Putin’s tyranny falls not just on the people of the nations he has violated, it falls on America as well,"" he said. Romney also predicted that Russian President Vladimir Putin may continue his aggression. ""History shows that a tyrant’s appetite for conquest is never satiated,"" he added. FLASHBACK: ROMNEY CALLING RUSSIA 'OUR NUMBER ONE GEOPOLITICAL FOE' PROMPTED MEDIA ONSLAUGHT IN 2012 ""America and our allies must answer the call to protect freedom by subjecting Putin and Russia to the harshest economic penalties, by expelling them from global institutions, and by committing ourselves to the expansion and modernization of our national defense,"" Romney said. Romney predicted in 2012 that Russia was America’s ""number one geopolitical foe,"" a comment that drew criticism from then-President Obama. ""A few months ago when you were asked what’s the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not al-Qaeda,"" Obama said during the third presidential debate between him and Romney in October 2012. ""And the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War’s been over for 20 years.""",Politics/Fox News,"Romney swipes Obama, Trump and Biden after Russia invades Ukraine: 'The '80s called and we didn't answer'",https://news.yahoo.com/romney-swipes-obama-trump-biden-053658950.html

2/24/2022,"It is just too easy to stand back and watch America reject Joe Biden’s policies and persona. Americans are smarter than some thought and their evaluation, shown in the polls, is consistent. With his approval rating around 38%, and his policies being roundly rejected, despite a rapturous media, it is fair to answer the question that Biden asked at a news conference last month: What are Republicans for? Let me try to explain. Republicans would, first, start treating the American people with respect and honesty. We will tell the American people the truth. They deserve no less and we are confident that they can handle it. We will be servant leaders. Under Biden, inflation is at a 40-year high. Cures are there. First, we would give the American people an honest balance sheet and cash flow statement, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards, as would those of any public company — no gimmicks, no off-balance sheet liabilities. Let Americans see the truth, for once, about our economic position. As for inflation, it is a supply and demand issue. We would ramp up American oil and gas production by aggressively facilitating pipelines, mineral leases, drilling and exploration. Increasing such supply would lower prices, sharply — not only for fuel, housing and food, but they also have a multiplier effect on costs for farmers, manufactures, shippers and airlines. On the demand side, immediately stop spending any stimulus dollars not already spent. We all see the results of pouring trillions of dollars of borrowed money into an overheated economy. Just stop the madness. As for supply bottlenecks, we would consult with and listen to actual truckers and trucking companies and ask them what is hampering the deliveries. Imposing new and tighter regulations on them, as done now, is not useful. Steps need to be taken to help the average American, not Wall Street or the elites, by bringing down that cruelest and most regressive tax, inflation. On immigration, we would complete the entire wall, impower Immigration and Customs Enforcement to enforce the law, keep the “remain in Mexico” policy and let in more legal immigrants who can contribute to our society. As many other countries do, evaluate each one based on language and professional skills, security concerns and the like, and let in just the ones who would enhance American society. As for Dreamers, let them alone, but any immigrant here illegally now who is convicted of any crime or applies for government aid should be deported. We will restore the concept of “equal justice for all.” Whether it be as to the Oath Keepers, antifa, BLM, the “mostly peaceful” rioters, the Clinton, the Trumps or the Bidens, the law will be enforced as to all. Crime is a local issue in great part. We would radically change course. America has a homicide epidemic in large cities and we can do better. We would direct all federal law enforcement aid to those areas that increase police funding, have prosecutors who actually prosecute felons and cooperate with federal authorities, remove no-cash-bail policies and send their recruits for real training. We are for voter ID laws, Election Day and not ""election season” voting, identification being required to be proven for absentee ballots and in-person voters, the voting rolls being accurate and absentee ballots being sent only to those who request them. Let the parents have power and knowledge. Respect and empower them. We need to stop the lies now. Parents are not morons. They love their children. We would support a new G.I. Bill in which every parent, not just the rich, can take those dollars attributable to his child and use those dollars to choose the best school for their children. The shame of so many tens of thousands on waiting lists for limited voucher programs must end. Let parents review, in advance, all materials and observe the classrooms. Let the sunlight in. We will reject the use of race as a basis for discrimination and will work to unite all Americans in a shared vision. We stand for free speech, and more of it, however much we oppose ideas expressed. We want to fight lies with truth, not with bats, fists, spittle and violence. Lastly, we want to return to sanity, to good common sense and listening to and addressing the needs of the American people. Edward B.
