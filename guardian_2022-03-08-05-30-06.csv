3/8/2022,"A driver has been found guilty of murdering a man by hitting him with a car and dragging him for more than half a mile. Martin Eastwood, 22, used a stolen Ford S Max to kill Liam Dent in the early hours of 26 July 2019 after a confrontation outside a pub in Chessington, Surrey. The jury heard he had convictions for two previous offences involving a car including an incident in September 2018 when Eastwood drove a stolen vehicle at a cyclist, knocking him to the ground and causing him multiple fractures. Then in April 2019, he drove a stolen vehicle at a man, knocking him to the ground and causing him abrasions. Dent’s body was dragged for half a mile at speeds of up to 32mph before landing in Moor Lane, Chessington. Jurors heard the 25-year-old victim was still alive and was able to lift his head up and move his arm, but died soon after. After a trial at the Old Bailey, Eastwood was found guilty of murder on Monday. DI Garth Hall, from Scotland Yard, said: “The actions of Martin Eastwood were callous and intentional, Liam did not stand a chance when he was struck by the car and dragged along the road to his death. “The thoughts of my team are with Liam’s family and friends today. They have finally got the verdict they have been longing for.” Detectives had been able to establish which car had been used in the attack and therefore who the perpetrator was after the Ford was found burnt out later that same night. Its telematics system was recovered, containing vital data establishing the route, speed and nature of the driving. The prosecutor, Michelle Nelson QC, said: “That data puts beyond dispute that the burnt-out Ford was the vehicle that hit Liam Dent and dragged his body to Moor Lane and the junction with Chessington Hill Road, causing his death. “It is also beyond dispute that when the Ford S Max struck Liam Dent, Martin Eastwood was behind the wheel.” Earlier in the evening, Dent had been in the Lucky Rover pub in Chessington with friends. While sitting outside, pubgoers heard offensive or threatening shouts from a Volvo, driven by Daniel Morris, with Eastwood in the front passenger seat, jurors heard. The shouts prompted some of the young men outside the pub to throw objects. Jurors heard that was the precursor for the Ford being driven at the same group, including Dent. Later that night, Eastwood drove the Ford in convoy with a BMW, driven by Morris, shadowing it, back to Chessington to search for the group. Having found them on Osborne Way, Eastwood “suddenly accelerated towards them, mounted the pavement, at some point it hit a metal post and struck Mr Dent”, Nelson said. “He disappeared, his body forced and trapped under the vehicle.” An Uber driver heard Dent groaning as the Ford passed by, with the BMW close behind it beeping its horn. He followed, with his dashcam recording the body lying in the road as the two cars drove away. Eastwood had denied intending to cause really serious harm, claiming it was an accident. Morris, 22, of no fixed address, had pleaded guilty to manslaughter shortly before the trial started, it can now be reported. Eastwood’s partner, Jasmine Robinson, 19, of Stoneleigh Crescent, Epsom, Surrey, was found guilty of assisting an offender. All three will be sentenced on 31 March.",News/UK news,Man found guilty of murder after dragging victim under car in Surrey,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/07/man-found-guilty-of-after-dragging-victim-under-car-in-surrey
3/8/2022,"Russia has been trying to recruit Syrians to fight in Ukraine to bolster Moscow’s flagging invasion, according to the Pentagon. A senior US defence official said it is unclear how many Syrians Vladimir Putin is seeking to recruit, but said “we find it noteworthy that he believes he needs to rely on foreign fighters”. The official added there was no evidence of Syrian fighters actually arriving in Ukraine so far. The Russian recruitment effort was first reported by a Syrian news website, DeirEzzor24, which said Moscow was seeking volunteers to act as guards on six-month contracts, for between $200 and $300 a month. The same report said the Russian mercenary firm Wagner had been equipping its Syrian operatives, who had served in the Libyan war on the side of the general, Khalifa Haftar, to transfer to Ukraine. The Wall Street Journal reported that some Syrian mercenaries were already in Russia and prepared to enter the fight in Syria. Russia has also deployed Chechen forces in Ukraine, according to the Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, a close ally of Putin’s. Last week, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, alleged that a unit of Chechen special forces had been sent to kill the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Danilov said Ukraine had received a tipoff from within Russia’s FSB intelligence agency and had intercepted and killed the Chechen hit squad on the outskirts of Kyiv. There has been so sign yet of any Belarus troops taking part in the Russian invasion of Ukraine or even preparing to take part, according to the Pentagon, despite reports that they may be sent to the front. The reports of recruitment of foreign fighters have come as the Russian offensive directed at Kyiv continued to stall, even after Putin has committed nearly 100% of the substantial invasion force he had mustered on Ukraine’s borders, comprising 127 battalion tactical groups, according to the Pentagon. “We’re not seeing a lot of progress,” a senior defence official said, attributing it to a combination of stiff Ukrainian resistance and “internal challenges” within the Russian forces. The US also deems Ukraine airspace to be still contested, as the Kyiv government’s forces still have most of their fixed-wing aircraft available and flying, and its air defences are still working. But the official cautioned that Russian troops are making more headway in the south, and Vladimir Putin still has a lot more combat power available to him, particularly his air force which has stayed on the sidelines of the war so far. As the ground offensive has stalled, the Pentagon said the Russians are relying more on rocket and missile attacks from a distance. As a result, more civilian areas are being hit, but the Pentagon cannot determine yet whether this is unintentional or deliberate targeting, which would be a war crime.",News/World news,"Russia trying to recruit Syrians to fight in Ukraine, says Pentagon",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/russia-trying-to-recruit-syrians-to-fight-in-ukraine-says-pentagon
3/8/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will address MPs via video link from Kyiv on Tuesday afternoon, where he is expected to plead for more arms and to repeat a call for a no-fly zone even though it has been rejected by Nato. In a first, the leader’s speech will be broadcast direct into the Commons chamber with formal business suspended so MPs can listen in with the help of simultaneous translation provided over headsets at 5pm. Ukrainian sources said he was expected to ask Britain to step up its support of arms – and to call for a change of heart in implementing a no-fly zone. “This is the No 1 issue for us. Crucial and vital,” an official said. Zelenskiy has made a string of often dramatic speeches via video link to western leaders since the start of the war. On Saturday, he made a “desparate plea” to 280 members of the US Congress for more aircraft, drones and anti-aircraft missiles. But while the west has been willing to supply Ukraine with increasing amounts of anti-tank and anti-air missiles to help blunt the Russian advance, both Britain and Nato have repeatedly rejected calls for a no-fly zone. On Sunday, Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, and the head of the armed forces, Adm Tony Radakin, said a no-fly zone risked starting a general war with Russia – and would not halt the artillery shelling that has been targeting Ukrainians in cities such as Kharkiv and Mariupol. “We’re not going to get ourselves into a direct military conflict with Putin because that would be a massive escalation, but also that feeds Putin’s narrative,” Raab said. A renewed plea from Zelenskiy will not change the government’s mind, but could have a significant effect on British public opinion. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, said he had given permission for the special address to take place. “Every parliamentarian wants to hear directly from the president,” he said. However, the Commons authorities said Zelenskiy would not be taking questions from the MPs present.",News/World news,Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address UK MPs via video link on Tuesday,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/volodymyr-zelenskiy-to-address-mps-via-video-link-on-tuesday-ukraine
3/8/2022,"The mother of an 11-year-old boy from Ukraine who travelled for nearly 700 miles to Slovakia with just a plastic bag, a passport and a telephone number written on his hand has spoken of her relief at her son’s safe escape from Russian bombs. Yulia Pisetskaya said she had put her son on a train to Slovakia from Zaporizhzhia, close to the nuclear plant that came under attack from Russian forces last week, out of desperation. She had been unable to leave with him from south-east Ukraine because she was unwell and needed to look after her disabled mother. Slovakian border guards looked after the boy, who has not been named, on his arrival, according to the police who have described him as a “hero”. He had the phone number of relatives in the Slovakian capital, Bratislava, written on his hand. The authorities were able to track them down and they have since taken him into their care. “I am very grateful that they saved the life of my child,” Pisetskaya said in a video message posted on Facebook on Sunday. “In your small country, there are people with big hearts.” She added: “I am a widow and I have more children. I want to thank the Slovak customs and volunteers who took care of my son and helped him cross the border. “I am grateful you have saved my child’s life. Next to my town is a nuclear power plant that the Russians are shooting at. I couldn’t leave my mother, she can’t move on her own.” The Slovakian interior ministry said on Facebook that the boy “won everybody’s hearts with his smile, fearlessness and determination, worthy of a real hero”. They said the authorities had “kept him warm and provided him with food and drink, which they packed for his next trip”. Officials added: “Thanks to the number on his hand and a piece of paper in his waist, he managed to contact his loved ones, who came for him later, and the whole story ended well.” “He came all alone from Zaporizhzhia because his parents had to stay in Ukraine,” police spokeswoman Denisa Bardyova told AFP. “The boy was cared for by many, be it policemen, soldiers, customs officers or volunteers and various religious or civil organisations.” Russian troops attacked the Zaporizhzhia site, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, which creates around 20% of Ukraine’s electricity, in the early hours of Friday. They have since taken control of the facility.",News/World news,"Mother who sent son, 11, on train out of Ukraine alone thanks Slovaks",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/mother-who-sent-son-11-on-train-out-of-ukraine-alone-thanks-slovaks
3/8/2022,"Prompted by the much-discussed Bros documentary, Flo & Joan’s last show fretted at the acrimonious end to which sibling musical partnerships must tend. This one looks through the other end of the telescope, at the prospect of these “singing spinster sisters” doomed to singledom and a 60-year co-dependency. That doesn’t seem such a grim fate given the fun that Flo, Joan (AKA Nicola and Rosie Dempsey) and their audience have across two hours of their touring set Sweet Release. If its new suite of comic songs isn’t quite as big-hitting as the 2019 vintage, this is another entertaining offer from the Dempseys, crowd-pleasing and well woven together. The chat between songs feels looser, too. Nicola, on keyboard, is still taciturn. Rosie, on vocals and sometimes drums, is still dotty. But the dynamic feels less engineered to be awkward than in the past. What seems spontaneous may not be always be so, mind you, given how many casual asides are recycled as lyrics and punchlines later in the show. That brings a neat sense of structure to the evening, whose numbers track the duo’s journey through dating apps, moments of mortification, and – reviving a back catalogue hit – nights (and jobs) lost to heavy drinking. The dating and relationships theme is lightly worn. One number imagines an alien boyfriend (“He doesn’t get along with my father / But he does get along with my microwave”). Another, off-message entirely, addresses – with jazz hands, trumpet noises and a pleasing spirit of free-association – those ageing male comedians inconvenienced by modern mores. The laughs are evenly shared between songs and chat: I loved the image conjured in one conversation, of the touring sisters in twin beds in a Travelodge, “cutting a quiche in half with a credit card”. It’s not all glamour, then. Nor laughter, either, when the focus turns to women’s public safety with a song whose jauntiness is overshadowed (as I’m sure Flo & Joan know) by the bleak realities it evokes. Elsewhere, merriment tends, just about, to outpace real-world concerns. It’s another fine set from a duo whose co-dependency, while bad for them, is a boon for audiences.  On tour until 19 June.",Arts/Stage,Flo & Joan review – crowd-pleasing merriment as singing sisters return,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/07/flo-joan-sweet-release-review-bloomsbury-theatre-london
3/8/2022,"Over the weekend we were told that Boris Johnson had a six-point plan with which he would lead the west to victory over Russia in Ukraine. However, on closer inspection – and on contact with reality – that plan didn’t seem to amount to very much more than you would expect from a toddler who had been asked to come up with something for a primary school assembly to help other children understand the war. Or something that Gavin Williamson – make that Sir Gavin – might have dreamed up. 1: Get humanitarian aid to Ukraine and be nice to refugees. 2: Support Ukraine’s efforts to do whatever Ukraine wants to do. 3: Increase sanctions on Moscow – though not on anyone we quite like, even if they owe their billions to Vlad the Invader. 4: Tell Russia to shut up and go away. 5: Tell Russia to shut up and go away a bit louder if Russia hasn’t already shut up and gone away. 6: Make more effort to ensure it never happens again. And that was it. Just six vague principles, on which anyone could more or less agree, and no metrics with which to measure their success. Certainly nothing by which The Suspect could claim to be leading the world’s response to the Russian invasion. There again, no one outside the UK is claiming that anyway. And even then, it’s only a small number of people inside Number 10 and Boris-friendly media who see Ukraine as a chance to reboot his premiership. To make him look impressive on the world stage and to make the country forget he is unfit for office. Certainly, the six-point plan appeared to be all but forgotten as Johnson gave a joint press conference with Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, and Mark Rutte, the prime minister of the Netherlands. As was any sense of the UK leading a western coalition against Russia. If Trudeau and Rutte were in any sense taking their cue from Johnson, it was news to them. Rather this was, as far as they were concerned, a meeting of equals. Of three leaders fumbling in the dark as they tried to impose rational solutions on an increasingly irrational Russia. Nor did The Suspect choose to bring up the six-point plan that he had briefed so heavily over the past couple of days in his opening remarks. Probably for the best. In hindsight, even he must see that it’s all a bit feeble. Rather, Johnson just stuck to garbled generalities and platitudes. The international community was almost unanimous in its condemnation and must move together. Putin had underestimated the west and must surely fail. And in the meantime, the UK would be giving Ukraine an extra £175m in humanitarian aid. Trudeau and Rutte said much the same, though in not so many words. Mercifully. Though Trudeau did twice mention something about the importance of middle-class jobs in the ongoing crisis, before going on to say that Canada would be imposing sanctions on 10 new individuals. This clearly startled Johnson. He sincerely hoped that the new people being targeted were not personal friends of his or philanthropists who had donated money to the Tory party. Most of the questions focused on the dependence of the west on Russian oil and gas. The three amigos more or less stuck to the same script. Reducing dependence was a good idea but not every country could move at the same speed. Obviously, no one was going to start an energy crisis in their own country just to help Ukraine. I mean, come on, everyone. Get real. Johnson merely added that he was open to abandoning his commitment to net zero and that increasing North Sea oil production and starting fracking was not off the cards. Though he didn’t seem to be aware that this might not solve the UK’s problems as the oil and gas was likely to be sold abroad. Things got trickier for The Suspect when he was asked about refugee visas and sanctions. On visas, he merely said that the UK wanted to be as generous as possible. Unfortunately, that turned out to be not very generous at all. After all, we had taken loads of Afghan refugees and now the UK was technically full. It was just Ukraine’s bad luck. But hopefully the Poles could help out. On sanctions, the UK was again going the extra mile. It was completely normal for the son of a KGB agent who had done bugger all for the UK to be granted a peerage after the personal intervention of the prime minister. In any case, it wasn’t as if Evgeny Lebedev ever went to the Lords. Or spoke. Or voted. He was a complete waste of space. He just liked to swan around while flunkeys called him “Lordski”. So, no harm done. He was hardly involved in UK politics at all. And as for the really bad oligarchs – as opposed to the pretend baddie oligarchs – The Suspect had them in his sights. Any that hadn’t been of use to the Conservatives would now find that they had to declare their beneficial interests in assets within six months rather than 18 months. However awfully inconvenient for them this might be. Somehow Trudeau and Rutte managed to keep a straight face. It was all rather low key. As if it had only just dawned on everyone there were no quick fixes on offer. Two weeks ago, Johnson had seen Ukraine’s tragedy as an easy shot at personal redemption. Now he was beginning to realise there were strings attached. Tricky choices that would leave him further compromised. Decisions that would cost lives. And personal responsibility isn’t The Suspect’s strongest suit. Nor that of his colleagues. In front of the foreign affairs select committee, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, was putting all the blame for the failure to take more than a handful of refugees on the Home Office. Nothing to do with her Guv. While in the Commons, Priti Patel was insisting that the Home Office figures of just 50 refugees were nothing to do with the Home Office. And that visa staff were in Calais when they weren’t. Apart from those on holiday. Then Priti Vacant at least has an excuse. She’s not just vicious, she’s stupid. Meanwhile, Ukraine burns and its citizens fight on alone. Just imagine their despair if they ever get wind of Johnson’s six-point plan.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson’s six-point plan for Ukraine turns out to be six vague principles,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/07/boris-johnsons-six-point-plan-for-ukraine-turns-out-to-be-six-vague-principles
3/8/2022,"Joe Root admitted his England team have a point to prove in the Caribbean and reiterated his own belief at being the right man to lead in a Test series that could decide his fate as captain. Speaking before Tuesday’s first Test against West Indies in Antigua – a match in which Durham’s Alex Lees will make his debut at opener and Jack Leach is likely to get the nod on a bare pitch – Root attempted to outline his vision of England’s so called “reset”. Despite one win in 14 and a horror Ashes series, the 31-year-old was backed to lead this tour when Andrew Strauss took over as the interim director of cricket. But with a new management team set to be appointed, his continuation beyond is not guaranteed and positive results are urgently required. “It’s an opportunity for all of us to prove a point,” said Root. “Hopefully this can be a real start in changing our performances; to start getting back to where we need to be, which is one of the leading teams in Test cricket. “I think I’m the right man for the role, the right man to take this team forward. And as long as that is the case, I’ll be fully committed to the role.” Root sidestepped the inevitable questions about the absence of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, preferring to focus on “the opportunity” for others. This means Chris Woakes and Craig Overton are likely to share the new ball with Ollie Robinson unfit, alongside Mark Wood’s pace and the spin of Leach. Key to this is how much Ben Stokes can bowl on his comeback from a side strain, with Root optimistic a limited number of overs are possible. Stokes has also recently shouldered arms to the Indian Premier League to focus on Test cricket, having admitted he felt he let down the team in Australia. “I’m pretty chuffed about it,” said Root, regarding this commitment from his vice-captain. “It shows how much he cares about Test cricket and how much he cares about this team and helping us get back to where we desire to be. “I think he is probably being slightly harsh on himself [about his Ashes performance]. But I think managing the expectations for himself, especially with where his body is currently at, is going to be really important. “We all expect Superman on the field. Coming back from an injury, he might not necessarily be able to do some of the things he’s done previously. So we’re going to have to be smart, how we manage him.” Root had encouraging words for Lees, his one-time opening partner at Yorkshire whose runs since a move to Durham in 2018 – and the decision to axe Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed after the Ashes – have made him the latest to attempt England’s most unsettled position. Ben Foakes returns behind the stumps after Jos Buttler lost his place in a reversion to picking the best gloveman. But Root stressed that the 29-year-old’s batting – good enough to register a century on his debut in Sri Lanka three years ago – should not be underestimated. England have never won in Antigua and Root’s opposite number, Kraigg Brathwaite, spoke with a quiet confidence on the eve of the series that is expected to see both teams take a knee for Black Lives Matter before the start of play. Brathwaite said: “This series is always different to every other series we have. We always look forward to it, especially at home. They have some quality cricketers still, so when we do well, you know it’s still a good feeling. To play Test cricket, there is always pressure involved. But as a team, we’re ready.”",Sport/Sport,Joe Root insists he is ‘right man to take England forward’ before Windies series,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/07/joe-root-insists-england-have-point-to-prove-in-west-indies-with-captaincy-on-line
3/8/2022,"Good morning. The Amazon is approaching a tipping point, data shows, which would have “profound” global implications. International Women’s Day today takes a focus on gender equality in the face of the climate crisis, which feels also pertinent on home shores today. Heavy rains and strong winds are expected to continue to batter the east coast again. Heavy Russian shelling was preventing civilian evacuations from six cities, Ukraine’s foreign ministry has said, just hours after Moscow announced the opening of “humanitarian corridors” that Kyiv dismissed as immoral and unacceptable after it emerged only two led to elsewhere in Ukraine, with all others heading straight to Russia or pro-Russian Belarus. Meanwhile, Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak faces a lengthy ban for wearing a “Z” on his uniform, a symbol in support of the invasion of Ukraine, on the medal podium of a World Cup event. Scott Morrison has declared the Coalition the “proven choice” of voters when it comes to managing Australia’s national security interests, but the latest Guardian Essential poll suggests respondents do not believe his government would handle the war between Russia and Ukraine any better than Labor. Despite a lack of unanimity over which party would best handle the conflict, a majority of respondents supported the Morrison government’s decision to provide military support to Ukraine and to supply aid and take in refugees fleeing the conflict. Volunteers in New South Wales flood zones estimate they have cooked a staggering 60,000 meals for flood victims, but frustration is growing at the lack of official government services available to take over. While the presence of government services and defence support is growing, there is a perception that not enough help is on hand. However, the Australian defence force has defended the speed of its response to flooded communities in northern NSW. “I think we have done all that we can within the conditions we have been faced with,” Maj Gen David Thomae said. Meanwhile, residents of Pitt Town on the flood-prone Hawkesbury-Nepean River are “screaming for something to be done” about a safer evacuation plan, after their designated evacuation route was cut by rising water, forcing authorities to locate a gate key to open the only backup path. The mayors of Newcastle and Wollongong are uneasy about the Morrison government naming their cities as a potential base for nuclear-powered submarines, with one describing the Aukus plans as a “fantasy”. The Coalition’s shortlist for potential bases were not in the top five identified by Defence in a 2011 review.

Beforehand, the boys put me through my paces and were like: ‘Oh yeah yeah yeah, you can sing in Greek, come on,’ and I’m like, ‘God almighty!’ I kept thinking to myself: ‘This is extraordinary, don’t drop the ball.’” When Netflix announced Byron Baes, a new Australian reality show about wealthy young influencers, there was immediate backlash from locals.

3/8/2022,"Two Scottish gardeners have rescued three students – one Irish and two Nigerian – who were trapped in the wartorn city of Sumy in the north-east of Ukraine. Along the way, the men were held at gunpoint by Russian soldiers – but were then rescued themselves by locals. Joe McCarthy, 55, and Gary Taylor, 45, who run Ready2Rock landscaping in Falkirk, made their evacuation dash on Monday morning when they picked up seven people including four Ukrainians. The seven included 19-year-old medical student Racheal Diyaolu from County Carlow, two Nigerian students, an elderly Ukrainian couple and a young mother and her son. Speaking from the back of the car safely 150 miles west of Sumy, Diyaolu said she was “relieved” but had mixed emotions about leaving friends behind. “My mother is very pleased but she is on edge and won’t be happy until I get home,” said Diyaolu. “It’s a bittersweet feeling because it is just so disheartening that so many students are still trapped.” The two Scottish men have become heroes at home after putting their own lives at risk by going to Sumy, which is just 25 miles from the Russian border and has been out of reach of any international rescue mission. “We had guns pointed to our heads, a tank’s sniper pointed at us, our front tyres shot at and our van ransacked, but locals helped us and took us to a garage, got us new tyres and showed us a back road to Sumy,” McCarthy told the Guardian on Monday. “After a good night’s rest, we got everyone and left. To be honest, we had a miserable day yesterday getting to Sumy, but we are out now and 240km [150 miles] away. “Our objective today was to get as far away as possible, stay overnight in a hotel and get to the border tomorrow.” Their dangerous run came more than a week after all public transport out of Sumy was cancelled, leaving an estimated 1,500 to 1,700 foreign students stranded. More than 700 are Indian pupils, with an estimated 400 from Nigeria. One student interviewed by Indian TV on Friday begged for immediate help, and confirmed they were running out of food and water. “Please take some immediate action or else we will die for sure,” she said. The two Scottish men have become heroes at home because of the evident risks they have taken after they decided they could not sit idly by and watch the humanitarian crisis unfold on TV. They had already completed two missions in Ukraine, including the rescue of a mother and her sick baby, when they got a request from a woman in Sumy. McCarthy said the journey to Sumy, close to Russian-controlled territory, was “mission impossible” but “worth it”. Diyaolu and her Nigerian friends, Roycee Iloielunachi and Anolajuwon Solarin, were planning to spend Monday night with the rest of the group overnight in a hotel in Kremenchuk, which is under Ukrainian control, before an early start for the border with Poland, Romania or Moldova. The Scottish gardeners have been charting their journey on TikTok and Facebook live. “I’m not going to lie, we could have just turned back yesterday when we met the Russians. But it was worth it – we have everyone with us now and bar any catastrophe we should be at the border in the morning,” said McCarthy.
