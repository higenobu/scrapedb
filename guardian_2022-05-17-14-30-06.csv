5/17/2022,"In the summer of 2020, a few weeks after firing their frontman Tom Meighan for assaulting his then-fiancee Vikki Ager, the two remaining founder members of Kasabian met up and asked themselves: “What now?” Radio stations had stopped playing their music. All the success of the past 17 years – during which the Leicester group became one of Britain’s biggest bands, with five No 1 albums, plus a debut that went three-times platinum – felt suddenly tainted. Winding things up seemed the next logical step, given they were now without their bolshie ringleader singer, whose ability to whip up a crowd had been crucial to their ascent. But Serge Pizzorno, Kasabian’s songwriter and leader, didn’t see it that way. “We can’t end the story like this,” he thought. It’s a cold spring morning and, on a sleepy lane on the outskirts of Leicester, the gates to Pizzorno’s house creak open. He emerges from his front door, tall, wiry and smiling, much more gently mannered than the belligerent anthems he’s become famous for might suggest. Pizzorno, now 41, leads me down the side of his house, along the garden, past his kids’ climbing frames and through a gap in the hedge, where a jet-black two-storey building awaits. A Japanese-style lightbox sign sticking out from the side tells us where we are: The Sergery, Pizzorno’s home studio. “I love Japan so much,” he enthuses, pointing up at the sign. “There’s a mega bit in Tokyo called Omotesando. I wanted a sign that would look like it’s from a street there. Those little details are so important to me.” This is where Kasabian recorded the bulk of their excellent new album, The Alchemist’s Euphoria, their first record since sacking Meighan, with Pizzorno stepping up to become the quartet’s vocalist and frontman. It plays up the adventurousness that has defined the band’s music away from their big indie-rock anthems, where Pizzorno’s love of hip-hop, electro, psychedelic off-roading and Italian film soundtracks comes to the fore. Some songs burn with the urgency of a band desperate to map out a new future but there’s also a feeling of loss: even the heaviest moments contain diversions into minor-chord majesty, as on the sweeping mini-prog epic TUVE, and the spiked grooves of recent single Scriptvre. Pizzorno’s vocals sometimes resemble Meighan’s aggro delivery when the music is full pelt, but in the more mellow moments his soft croon is starkly different. Pizzorno never wanted to be a frontman: initially, the band wondered if they should get a new singer. The more Pizzorno thought about it, though, the more he became convinced he was the man for the job. “I know these songs,” he says, taking a seat by the mixing desk. “They’re ingrained in my soul. I know exactly where I was when I wrote every word. It would be difficult for me to convey that to someone new.” After Meighan’s exit, getting back into the studio was therapy for Pizzorno. “We were all set up to play stadiums and make another record,” he says. “I had these amazing pieces of music, so I came in here and started to write for fun.” He says he is still coming to terms with the events surrounding the departure of Meighan, who was sentenced to community service three months after the assault. Domestic abuse charities criticised the 200-hour order as insufficient, given it was revealed in court that Meighan had repeatedly struck Ager, held her by the throat and dragged her by the ankles. The couple have since married. “The summer when Tom left was absolutely heartbreaking,” Pizzorno says. “It felt like leaving home and coming back and seeing it burnt down, walking round the ashes, seeing old pictures and artefacts and picking things up and sifting through the destruction. It was an intense time.” He pauses then continues: “Over the years, we’ve dealt with a lot. When it all came out, you’d see things being said and written that were hard to take because you’ve lived it – you know the true story.” A highlight of the new record is a seething Prodigy-style banger called Rocket Fuel, which addresses the flak Pizzorno feels has come his way from fans aggrieved the group didn’t give Meighan a second chance. “It always amazes me how strong people’s opinions are when they don’t know anything about the actual truth,” he says. “There’s way more to it. Who in their right mind would sack a frontman if there wasn’t cause?” He goes on: “Over the years, there have been some tough moments. I don’t want to go into them because I feel like that’s the band’s business.” After apologising Meighan announced he was suffering from alcohol addiction, and had been diagnosed with ADHD. “With Tom, all we ever tried was love and support. There were times when we needed professional help – that was all taken care of. But when we were finally made aware of the incident, he’d crossed the line at that point.” The most hurtful thing you could level at him or the band, Pizzorno says, is that they weren’t there for Meighan, or didn’t try everything they could over the years. He chews over a question about whether he misses the singer, eventually saying: “I miss who Tom used to be.” A few days later, speaking by phone, bass-player Chris Edwards adds: “I think part of Tom wanted to go solo but he didn’t have the heart to tell us. A couple of weeks after the incident, Tom said he was going to go solo and the band had split up. As soon as we heard this, me and Serge sat down and said, ‘Do you want to keep doing this?’ It’s all we know, so if we can do it and the fans still want it, let’s go for it.” Meighan has since launched his solo career with a UK tour and is currently preparing his debut record. “All we ever wanted was for him to be happy,” says Pizzorno, who hasn’t spoken to Meighan since their post-trial meeting. “So if he’s happy doing that, then great.” Edwards hasn’t talked to him for over a year either but says he still cares for him. “The last time we spoke, I said, ‘Mate, if you need help, if you fall off the wagon, if you have problems with anything at home, you can come and stay at mine.’ That’s how we left it – with a hug and we said we loved each other. There’s no malice in the separation. It’s heartbreaking but it’s happened.” There were some people in the band’s wider circle who questioned their decision to carry on. “They didn’t think I could do it,” says Pizzorno. “And they’re maybe the people I don’t speak to so much any more.” He felt vindicated when rehearsals began for the group’s first post-Meighan tour towards the end of 2021, a feeling heightened by finally going out on stage: “The weight of standing there, front and centre – I was in this incredible state.” Way back at the beginning of lockdown, before all of this, Pizzorno took the time to look back over everything the band had achieved. “That’s the first time I’d ever stopped in my life,” he says. “I got a chance to sit in a deckchair and go, ‘What the fuck was that about?’” He thought about their wild early days and the time they stayed up all night worrying before their first Glastonbury gig, because they didn’t think anyone would turn up. “It was full – 20,000 people,” he laughs. From that moment on, they believed they could be huge. “We were the perfect cocktail. The mid-90s had a massive impact on our attitude towards success and being in a band. I started with dance music. But once Britpop happened, we were told, ‘Get as big as you can.’ I had that drive.” That impulse remains, he says, although the ambitions are different. Size is no longer everything. “It’s about wanting to make the music as perfect as it can be, thinking about how I can make a show something where people go, ‘Did you see that?’” He studies his favourite artists– Tyler the Creator, Iggy Pop, Björk, PJ Harvey, plus Liams Howlett and Gallagher – and wants to incorporate a bit of each into who he is as a frontman. One thing he loved about Kasabian’s return to live performance last year was how young the crowds were. “It needs that mosh in the centre, that bounce from the youth,” he says. “In the surrounding area were people who have been there from the start, but the core were just kids. Seeing them losing their minds, that’s when you know it’s worth carrying on. A whole new generation are getting into it.”  The Alchemist’s Euphoria is released on 5 August on Sony Music Entertainment.

5/17/2022,"More than half of people in the UK have already seen their health deteriorate as a result of the cost of living crisis, a survey reveals as doctors warned some patients can no longer afford to look after themselves. A YouGov poll of 2,001 people commissioned by the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) found 55% felt their health had worsened owing to issues such as higher heating and food costs. One in four of these people had been told this was the case by a doctor or other medical professional, with stress seen as a driving factor of ill-health. “The cost of living crisis has barely begun, so the fact that one in two people is already experiencing worsening health should sound alarm bells, especially at a time when our health service is under more pressure than ever before,” said Dr Andrew Goddard, the president of the RCP. Of all those who reported their health getting worse, 84% said it was due to increased heating costs, 78% cited the rising cost of food and almost half (46%) said transport costs had had an impact. About 37% of those in higher income brackets (ABC1) said the cost of living crisis had had a fairly negative impact on their health, while 16% said it had had a very negative impact. Of those in lower socio-economic groups, 37% said it had had a fairly negative impact and 22% said it had had a very negative impact. “This survey demonstrates that the cost-of-living crisis is damaging the perceived health and wellbeing of poorer people,” said Prof Sir Michael Marmot, director of the University College London Institute of Health Equity. “The surprise is that people in above-average income groups are affected, too.” RCP members also revealed how people were suffering, with one saying a woman’s ulcers on her fingertips had been made worse by her house being cold. Another patient could not afford to travel to hospital for lung cancer investigation and treatment while medics also reported people’s asthma and other lung conditions were being made worse by exposure to mould in poor quality council housing. “Many more families will have to choose between forgoing essentials that are vital to living healthy lives – such as food and heating – or being driven into the stress and uncertainty of problem debt,” said Katherine Merrifield, the assistant director for healthy lives at the Health Foundation. “The government needs to get a hold on the crisis. Recent decisions suggest they are yet to fully grasp the pandemic’s stark lesson that health and wealth are fundamentally intertwined.” A government spokesperson said: “We understand how the rising cost of living is making life harder for people and we are providing support worth over £22bn in 2022-23 to help families with these pressures.”",News/Business,"Half of Britons say cost of living crisis has made health worse, poll finds",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/17/cost-of-living-crisis-health-worse-poll-britons
5/17/2022,"Millions of people with osteoporosis should not be afraid to exercise regularly, experts have said in guidance aimed at boosting bone health, cutting the risk of falls and improving posture. The condition, which weakens bones and makes them more likely to break, affects more than 3 million people in the UK and more than 150 million worldwide. The most common injuries are a broken wrist, hip and spinal bones. More than 500,000 people receive hospital treatment for fragility fractures every year on the NHS as a result of osteoporosis. This article includes content hosted on theguardian.. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. Until now, there has not been any UK guidance on exercise and osteoporosis. There is some in the US, Australia, and Canada but even that is incomplete. Regular exercise strengthens bones, reduces the risk of fractures and falls, and improves posture, as well as bolstering overall mental and physical health, experts say, which is why it is important that people with osteoporosis do not miss out. But uncertainties about what type of physical activity is safe, particularly later in life or when bones have significantly weakened, have left doctors uncertain what to recommend and deterred some patients from regular activity. In an attempt to clear up the confusion, a multidisciplinary panel of experts reviewed existing evidence and drew on clinical and patient opinion to reach agreement on recommendations to maximise bone health while minimising fracture risk. The resulting consensus statement, endorsed by the Royal Osteoporosis Society, has been published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. People with the condition should be encouraged to do more rather than less, it says, by undertaking an exercise routine that focuses on muscle strengthening on two to three days a week and brief bursts of moderate-impact activities, such as jogging, aerobics or Zumba on most days. And for those who have previously sustained a vertebral fracture or who are frail/elderly, the advice is to include lower-impact exercise up to the level of brisk walking for 20 minutes a day. The chair of the panel, Dawn Skelton, a professor of ageing and health at Glasgow Caledonian University, said: “Anyone who is new to regular physical activity, worried about their technique or unsure how to build their fitness can seek advice from any trained exercise instructor. Those with a history of falls or serious concerns about their balance can contact their local falls service.”",News/Society,"Osteoporosis patients should not be afraid to exercise regularly, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/17/osteoporosis-exercise-guidance-uk-britain
5/17/2022,"After two years of lockdowns, offices are almost unrecognisable. In many of them, staff are returning under a hybrid model, working from home a few days a week and coming in for the others. Some organisations slashed their floor space during the pandemic, making what is left feel distinctly cramped, while others have removed desks, and look a lot like departure lounges. A lot of us are hot-desking for the first time in our working lives, without a desk, chair, computer or pot plant to call our own. And people have changed, too. Much to the disgust of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson, after two years of WFH we have got used to wearing jogging pants, talking to our pets, cooking our own lunches, picking children up from school and doing mid-morning naked yoga while also getting our work done. So, as the commuter trains start to fill once more and the mug cupboard gets its first proper action since early 2020, what are the rules of this new office life? How do I survive all these meetings? At least when I was Zooming I could pretend the wifi had gone down. “When it comes to meetings, we should be having less of them,” argues Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at the Alliance Manchester Business School, and co-author of Remote Workplace Culture. “If you have them, have them quick and have them late. Instead of having it at 9 o’clock where it can go on until 12, have it at 11.30, because everyone gets hungry at 12.30. Three-hour meetings are useless. Reach your goddamn decision and don’t have game-playing.” You can also set an alarm on your phone to go off 10 minutes into one of those scheduled informal “chats” that can fill the soul with dread. Once your phone starts vibrating, you can claim it’s an urgent call to do something – anything – else. And if someone corners you when you’re trying to wrap up for the day? “If someone was hovering around my desk, I’d just explain that I want to go home and see my kids,” says Cooper. “But I’d add that I’ll give them a call and talk properly another time.” Everyone in my office stinks – perfume, gym, feet, cigarette smoke, aftershave, fruity vape clouds, breath. How do I cope? Should I tell them? Might they not realise? The onion armpits, the stagnant gym bag, the Hoover-bag breath: it is sort of amazing anyone ever sleeps with their colleagues. “If you’re in a position of responsibility and they are in your team and it was becoming a problem for business – say they were stinking out meeting rooms or clients were saying something – then I think it would be worth saying something, as long as they are your junior,” suggests etiquette expert Jo Bryant. “I don’t think you can start telling your boss they smell – it’s not going to go well.” But how exactly do you tell a colleague that they hum? “I think it would be worth saying: ‘Somebody noticed a smell the other day in a meeting, so I’m just asking everybody to double-check that jackets and shirts are clean.’” In other words, make it vague and make it anonymous. “Explain that you’re just doing a team-wide thing – everybody’s checking, because something has been said; you can’t say by who.’” And if it’s your boss? My primary schoolteacher mum always swore by a dab of tiger balm under your nostrils, Olbas oil on your collar or mentholated chewing gum to block out the stench of other people’s bodies. Or maybe you should invest in a really heavy-duty face mask. The office chair is killing my back. Can I ask for a better one? And how do I stop colleagues from fiddling with the levers while I’m away? Alison Green, author of Ask a Manager, points out that you are well within your rights to ask for a better chair if the current one is causing you physical discomfort. “Frame it in terms of ergonomics, and ask for an ergonomic assessment, if that’s a thing your workplace does. As for stopping colleagues from messing with it, that can be a losing battle. You can always try asking them to stop – but if they need to use that chair when you’re not in, they need it to fit them just as much as you need it to fit you. The real problem may be that your office needs more chairs.” I miss my spouse, children, dogs etc. Is it OK to Zoom them from the office? Modern etiquette, explains Bryant, is all about causing the least amount of friction. “Before the pandemic, we would have gone to a breakout area, waited until lunchtime or gone out of the building for a few minutes to make a phone call; exactly the same rules should apply to video calls. The exception to that rule might be if it was late in the evening, the office was quiet, you were having to work late and you want to say goodnight to the children. But in normal, busy office hours, it should be avoided.” That’s no fun. Is it at least OK to walk around the office while I’m on the phone? I want to hit my 10,000 steps. “If you see people just walking around – as if they’re in their sitting room or walking down the street – that’s disturbing for other people,” Bryant says. “If you were that busy, you wouldn’t be wandering around. It’s the ‘busy’ people who are always doing miles around the office, calling it multitasking and telling everyone how busy they are. There’s no need to draw attention to yourself in that way.” If your office has hot-desking, how do you reserve your favourite seat (by the spider plant, with the view of the train line, out of view of the colleague who harrumphs whenever you open a packet of crisps) without getting in at 7am? “We’ve seen firms try to do hot-desking before, and one of the ways people tried to retain a little bit of ownership was almost like a dog cocking their leg – they’d keep it disgusting,” says Bruce Daisley, author of The Joy of Work, presenter of the Eat Sleep Work Repeat podcast and former vice-president of Twitter in Europe. “I think that’s a classic performative bit of status. A low-status person definitely wouldn’t dare to leave their space looking dishevelled.” Unless your workplace has a formal booking-in system then you have to accept that you’re not going to get your favourite desk, mouse, or chair, says Bryant. “If you’re hybrid working, in a team situation where you know you’re doing two or three days and know who you’re sharing your desk with, I think you could leave your notebook or pen neatly on the desk. But nobody wants to sit down in front of pictures of your children or novelty pencil sharpener. If you’re hot-desk sharing or hybrid sharing with someone senior to you, then clean out every time. Also, don’t leave anything around that could be personal or data-sensitive – be sensible about it.” Is my “professional tracksuit” going to cut it at work? It is black and it does have a waistband – but it also has quite a lot of elastic and some fairly indelible porridge marks. “A shirt or a suit makes some people feel more comfortable,” says Cooper. “Personally, I haven’t worn a suit for a year and a half and in that time I’ve written five books.” Cooper points towards the fact that the old model of hard shoes and shaved faces didn’t seem to make us more productive. “If we were so efficient pre-Covid, in the formal environment we had, why was productivity per capita bottom of the G7 and 17th out of the G20? I’d say our environments weren’t relaxed enough. If you’re customer-facing and you think your customers or clients want you to be formal, that’s one thing. But I think we need to lighten up.” What do I do if someone on a nearby desk starts coughing? Is it rude to move seats? Should I offer them a sweet? A lateral flow test? A mask? “I think I’d ignore it to start with,” advises Bryant. “If it didn’t go away, I’d ask if they were feeling OK, hint, hint. If it carried on, at the end of the day I might say: ‘Do you think you ought to stay at home tomorrow because it’s horrible for you to have to be in such a dry, air-conditioned environment with your cough.’” Put it as a concern for their comfort, rather than your own, and highlight the fact that, hopefully, many of us are now more able to work from home. As for sniffing, my personal advice would be to follow the lead of my old classmate during our GCSE exams and wear earplugs. Is it ever appropriate to microwave fish in an office kitchen? My first ever office – in Leeds – had a working kitchen with a hob in the basement and I thought nothing of cooking a full stir-fry down there during my lunch break. I even grated the carrots. Another colleague ate tinned mackerel at her desk. “To some extent, we forgot that being in an office meant the occasional smell of someone microwaving fish,” Daisley points out. “Or the challenge of dealing with the person next to you chewing gum all day. The mini-frustrations or hell that other people represent. We’re just coming to terms with it again.” You could always, if really tortured, put an Out of Order sign on the microwave, turn it off at the plug and go back to your joyless cold sandwich feeling smug. Can I ask someone who’s off sick to join our Zoom call? It’s not going to kill them, surely? “If they’re off work because they’re sick, it’s an absolute no,” says Bryant. “If they’re off work because they’re doing something like childcare, or waiting in for a plumber, then I think the pandemic has opened up the concept that we can log in from anywhere and do our jobs more remotely than we thought. If people aren’t incapacitated themselves, and are able to join the call from home, then I think that’s fine. As long as you’re not encroaching on some private emergency or crisis. There are boundaries.” What do I do if I need to burp, fart, scratch, yawn or sneeze during a meeting? I can’t turn off my mic and camera any more? Bodies are such chaotic, animal things. Even when they are dressed up in a navy polyester blazer and put in a swivel chair. “We all need to relearn the techniques we used to use to handle these moments, before going remote,” Green advises. “Sneezing is generally recognised as uncontrollable; it’s going to happen. But if you have to burp, fart, or scratch yourself somewhere indelicate, ideally you’d briefly excuse yourself from the meeting. Yawning is trickier. It can be just as uncontrollable as sneezing but can give the impression that you’re bored or disengaged. Drinking water can help but if you really can’t hold it in, try to be discreet about it. You want it to be as subtle and as far away as possible from a loud, back-stretching yawn.” I don’t wear a mask in the office but one of my colleagues does. Should I mask up when I approach them for a chat? If there’s a group of us in a small room, should we all put masks on? There are no longer any real rules about this, which means each organisation must create its own guidelines and each member of staff is responsible for how they act. But what are the medical implications? “It very much depends on whether you work with anybody vulnerable, who might be at higher risk,” says Dr Sarah Jarvis, GP and clinical director of Patient.info. “If it’s a relatively young, relatively healthy, all-vaccinated group of people and there are 10 of you, the chances of anybody being infected at any one time is probably one in five or so, which means there’s an 80% chance you’d be wearing face masks all day for ‘no reason’. Saying that, if you work with people who are older, more vulnerable and particularly if they have suppressed immune systems for any reason, then the risks are not remotely insignificant.” You can usually spot if someone in your office is older but whether someone has an underlying health condition can be impossible to judge. “I don’t think it’s fair to put the onus on that person to talk to everyone in the team,” Jarvis continues, “so perhaps have a chat with your line manager.” That is, after all, what bosses are for. As for the type of mask you wear, Sarah’s answer is wry but pertinent: “It does need to have at least two layers. But frankly, a fairly cheap, two-layer cloth mask is a great deal more effective if worn over your nose and mouth than the best FFP mask in the world when it’s only worn beneath your chin.” How do I tell my manager that I want to keep working flexitime? They don’t have kids and only have a 15-minute commute, so I just don’t think they understand. Ideally, you’d point to how well it has been working already, Green suggests. “Explain that it’s been a major boon to your quality of life not to have to spend as much time commuting, and talk about what you’ve done to ensure it hasn’t affected your work. If you haven’t already been doing it and thus don’t have that data to point to, another approach is to ask to do it as a limited-time experiment, such as for six weeks, and then revisit it after that so that your boss has a chance to see that it works.” Are tea rounds still allowed or do we all have to do the lonely caffeine walk to the kettle solo, now? I once worked with a woman who remembered whose mug was whose by lining them up along the counter from who she thought was most leftwing to most rightwing, while she boiled the kettle. You could, alternatively, reduce the chances of cross-infection by asking for a washing-up sponge and some detergent. “The tea round was a wonderful, very gentle assertion of these mini bonds of connection between us,” says Daisley, sounding wistful. “In the past few years we’ve got our work done tactically, and we’ve maybe detached ourselves from some of the office idiots, but one thing we’ve definitely done less in the past two years is laughed. The late chief rabbi Jonathan Sacks talked about ‘simcha’. It’s a Hebrew word that translates as joy, but it’s also a participle of ‘we’. Every time we have meaningful moments, they become part of who we are, they have simcha running through them. In a very small, British way, the tea round had that simcha to it.”",Lifestyle/Money,"Hot desking, tea rounds and surviving meeting irl: the new rules of the office",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/17/hot-desking-tea-rounds-and-surviving-meeting-irl-the-new-rules-of-the-office

Writing in the Radio Times, Lucy Worsley, a historian and author, said: “[Although] we like to think we’re better than the people who hunted witches, witch-hunting still happens in some parts of the world today.” The prejudices that led to witch-hunts in the 16th and 17th centuries continue to exist and women, especially outspoken ones, were still targeted by men, she said.

It’s still the case that women – especially odd-seeming, mouthy ones – often feel the anger of the men whose hackles they raise. “Today, ever so many people, but perhaps women in particular, feel a sense of kinship with our ancestors who were persecuted in this way. Anyone who has ever been put down as a ‘difficult’ woman hears a distant echo of the past.” The historian’s four-part series, Lucy Worsley Investigates, takes a closer look at the experiences of people who “lacked power in the past”, with one such example being Agnes Sampson, a Scottish woman who was accused of being a witch and burned at the stake in 1591. On International Women’s Day in March, the first minister of Scotland issued an apology to the 4,000 people in the country, the vast majority being women, who were convicted and often executed under the Witchcraft Act of 1563. “Those who met this fate were not witches, they were people, and they were overwhelmingly women,” Nicola Sturgeon said. “At a time when women were not even allowed to speak as witnesses in a courtroom, they were accused and killed because they were poor, different, vulnerable or in many cases just because they were women.” According to Worsley, Sampson was only one of the many women accused of witchcraft in 16th- and 17th-century Scotland, and “represents represents ever so many more”. She said: “I’m glad, 400 years later, that people reading this will also learn of her name and achievements, as well as the horrible, unjust way in which her life came to an end.” Worsley, who was awarded an OBE in 2018 for her services to history and heritage, is the joint chief curator and Historic Royal Palaces.

5/17/2022,"South American weevils have been released into Britain’s waterways by the government in order to tackle the invasive species floating pennywort. The industrious bugs are being heralded as a hope to cut back the weed, which grows rapidly and blankets rivers and canals, drowning out the light and choking the life within. Floating pennywort was brought over from North America as an ornamental plant. It can grow up to 20cm a day, forming dense rafts over rivers that are not only detrimental to biodiversity but disrupt recreational activities such as fishing and canoeing, and exacerbate flood risk. It is highly unusual to release non-native species into the wild to tackle invasive species, and this is the first time biocontrol has been used to tackle pennywort. When asked whether the release couldturn into an old-woman-who-swallowed-a-fly situation, with the weevils later needing to be controlled, officials assured the Guardian that there had been a decade of tests into the safety of the release. The government has also stressed that releases of weevils are strictly controlled, and require a licence from the Environment Agency. Richard Benyon, the minister for biosecurity, said: “It is important that we tackle invasive non-native species to protect our native plants and animals and safeguard our environment, economy and health. “We all have a role to play in stopping the destruction caused by floating pennywort – and the release of the South American weevil will boost our efforts to eradicate this pest from our waterways once and for all.” The releases were carried out during the winter, with more planned for this summer. Since 2011, the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CABI), with Defra funding, has been investigating the potential use of a biocontrol agent for floating pennywort. They found that Listronotus elongatus were effective at removing it as they laid eggs on and ate the plant. The larvae also eat into the stems, reducing its ability to grow. Djamila Djeddour, a senior scientific officer at CABI, said: “Following years of extensive research into the potential biocontrol of floating pennywort, we are pleased and excited to have released the weevil into the wild. Field studies by CABI scientists and collaborators in South America found this weevil to be the most promising agent and after comprehensive screening in CABI’s quarantine facility in the UK, it was confirmed to be highly specialised, only feeding and developing on this damaging weed. “Further releases will begin later this year, supported by a range of sponsors, and the weevil’s impact, establishment and spread will be closely monitored.”",News/Environment,South American weevils released in UK waterways to tackle invasive weed,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/17/south-american-weevils-released-uk-waterways-tackle-invasive-weed-floating-pennywort
5/17/2022,"Light pollution has decreased as a result of fears over soaring energy costs, a survey by the countryside charity CPRE has suggested. Stargazers have been enjoying the best view of the night sky since 2011, as light pollution sharply dropped during the pandemic lockdowns and the levels continue to fall despite restrictions having been lifted. Reasons light pollution has fallen, according to the charity, include households being more conscious about wasting energy due to high prices, and councils reducing street lighting. A continued trend of home working has also caused a reduction in light pollution from offices. In February and March this year, 2,500 people took part in the star count survey, in which they were asked to report the number of stars they could see in the Orion constellation. Light pollution, which the charity tracks by recording where people are able to see 10 or fewer stars with the naked eye, has continued to fall. This article includes content hosted on theguardian.. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. After peaking in 2020, when 61% of participants reported seeing 10 or fewer stars, severe light pollution fell to 51% of respondents in 2021 and continued its slide this year, to 49%. The charity hopes that even if energy prices fall, people, councils and businesses will continue to limit the lighting they use at night. This would reduce carbon emissions and help wildlife. Emma Marrington, CPRE’s dark skies campaigner, said: “Half of the people who took part in [the] star count experienced severe light pollution that obscures their view of the night sky. This is bad for wildlife and human health – and the energy being needlessly wasted is bad financially and bad for our planet. “But the good news is that these results show small adaptations can make a big difference. If there is a silver lining from the legacy of lockdown and, now, the soaring cost of energy, it is that it has never been clearer how simple it is to cut carbon emissions and energy bills while improving our natural environment.” The charity has been campaigning for legal protection for the night sky, and also has called for local authorities to better plan where they put street light, so it is used effectively and does not cause needless pollution. Crispin Truman, the chief executive of CPRE, said: “Our view of the night sky – and all the benefits it undoubtedly brings – is being blotted out by light pollution. Like all forms of pollution, it is damaging our mental and physical health, and also having a severe impact on wildlife. Yet, it is a form of pollution that is allowed to increase year on year without any effort being made to control the damage it is causing.”",News/Environment,"Light pollution falling amid soaring energy prices, star survey finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/17/light-pollution-falling-amid-soaring-energy-prices-star-survey
5/17/2022,"This is an intriguing landscape, not just because it’s a rare point of union for three counties: Derbyshire, Staffordshire and Cheshire. As much as it’s a real place, it exists as a powerful meme on social media, and come the bank holiday, the double stream through arched bridges, with its modest white-water fall of about 3 metres, is thronged with people. I’m not sure exactly why they come or what exists between the ears of some of those motivated to visit. Recently I was stopped by a carful of five arriving from Cambridge, who asked for directions. When I told them that they would have to park half a mile away and walk, they drove off, never to return. However, I then went on to have an experience at Three Shires Head that suggested there is something magical at play here. Three birds of prey – red kite, peregrine and buzzard – were all playing together in the sky over the River Dane. Had you seen such a constellation at Three Shires Head when I was a child you would have been overcome with shock and disbelief. Now the trio is less exceptional, but raptors at play in this manner are never less than pure joy. It began with a duet between kite and female falcon, the two long-winged, lithe birds each taking turns to shadow the other’s motion, rising and falling and spiralling in pursuit. The kite, its russet plumage bright even in that dull cold sky, was the more dynamic. Every wing beat was slow and deep. The long tail – brightest of all its parts – closed and flared as it jinked and shifted. No one will convince me that these jousts aren’t fun for their makers. Then the kite, with devilish intention, sallied through a bare oak and tipped a previously unseen buzzard off its perch. The peregrine called and circled away. The kite, wings half-closed and rudder flashing red, looks so loose and fluid compared with the solemn, grudging, unflapping response of the buzzard. Then all three rose and ringed around me overhead in a brief, air-uplifted circuit.
