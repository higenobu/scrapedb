3/19/2022,"As Boris Johnson flew to the Gulf this week to ask for more oil to replace supplies from Russia, he was accused by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, of “going cap in hand from dictator to dictator”. At the same time, a report produced by the International Energy Agency (IEA) underlined just how limited the options are for any economy seeking to replace Russian crude and other oil products. It says global oil demand is projected to be nearly 100m barrels per day (bpd) this year, lower than previously forecast because of the shock to global growth caused by the war in Ukraine. Russia produces about 10m bpd and exports about half of that plus about 3m bpd of oil products. It is unclear, however, how much of that supply might now be at stake. The IEA thinks that at least 1.5m bpd of oil and 1m bpd of oil products are likely to be lost from Russia, from April until at least the end of the year, as buyers either reject supplies voluntarily or do so to avoid breaching sanctions. It says: “These losses could deepen should bans or public censure accelerate.” “In reality, no one country can plug the hole that Russia would leave in the market in the event of a global ban,” says Sophie Udubasceanu, global crude oil expert at energy market analysts ICIS. So where can the world try to source anything up to 5m extra barrels of oil a day? It is no surprise that the Gulf should be the first stop on the UK prime minister’s itinerary. Saudi, with 2m bpd spare, and the United Arab Emirates with 1.1m bpd are the only two leading oil producers with immediate spare capacity to offset a Russian shortfall. As the IEA notes, however, they are so far “showing no willingness to tap into reserves”. Both are members of the Opec+ cartel of oil-producing countries, which meets again on 31 March to decide on output levels. Opec members agreed to raise output by a modest 400,000 bpd earlier this month, despite full knowledge of the Ukraine situation. A Saudi/UAE increase including their spare capacity would “potentially lead to the demise of the Opec+ cooperation”, says Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen, signalling such a move is unlikely. He also points out that no oil producer would ever max out their spare capacity, the maintenance of which is an important price stabiliser and a buffer in case of unforeseen disruption. The IEA reckons Iran has about 1.2m bpd of spare capacity in theory but there are some serious caveats. The first is the need for sanctions to be lifted, via a resolution in talks between Tehran and western economies about reviving the 2015 deal on Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Even then, the IEA says, it is likely to take another six months at least before 1m bpd from Iran could be factored in. Iran has 100m barrels in floating storage that could be accessed quickly but it would take months to feed into the global supply chain. Like Iran, Venezuela remains subject to US sanctions that would have to be lifted if its production was to increase. A return to 2015 output would mean an extra 1.8m bpd eventually but that would trickle through very gradually. “A few hundred-thousand barrels would be the initial impact with a continued recovery likely to take years and billions of dollars of new investments,” says Hansen. “US exports have been rising most of 2021, peaking in December at 3.45m bpd, when not threatened by hurricanes or power outages,” says Udubasceanu, who sees little chance of a rapid acceleration in that trend. Hansen agrees, saying an extra 0.5m bpd could be added if US shale output were to return to its 2019 peak but that this would be held up by ongoing shortages of sand, truckers, fracking crews and rigs. Nor would the uplift be fast. Rystad Energy, a research company, estimates an average time of eight months from spudding (starting) a new well to oil flowing to market. Nigeria is still 0.4m bpd below its 2019 peak output, says Hansen. Restoring that level would require investment from major oil companies and greater political stability. The IEA also cites Canada and Argentina as potential contributors via their own US-style shale resources, but nothing that would move the needle. It does not even mention the North Sea in its assessment of alternative supply sources.",News/Business,"After Ukraine, how will the world replace Russia’s oil products?",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/19/after-ukraine-how-will-world-replace-russia-oil-products
3/19/2022,"Last month, a small group of international scientists met to decide an issue critical to the health of millions of people all over the planet. For once, it wasn’t about coronavirus, although these experts know a lot about that, too. The task in hand was to save us from a bug we’ve been fighting since before the days of Hippocrates, the first doctor to describe it in 400BC. It’s an adversary potentially as much of a threat as Covid. These scientists are the flu hunters – heads of a handful of international institutions who track this old foe as it evolves and disperses in its own fight for survival. This crucial annual meeting was held, for the first time since Covid struck, in the plateglass anonymity of the World Health Organization building in Geneva, with a few participants on Zoom. The scientists came armed with mountains of data and decades of experience to decide which four strains of the flu virus circling the globe should be in the next flu vaccine, to protect us from illness and our healthcare systems from buckling. Each has their own opinion and there can be wrangling and even some political positioning. Experts from China, the US, Australia, Japan and Russia are involved. It’s not always easy. But on 25 February, with what surely ought to have been a white puff of pontifical smoke, they made their recommendation public. Many thousands of lives will be saved – if they have got it right. Chairing the meeting was British virologist Dr John McCauley, who has attended these meetings for more than a decade – usually in person. “It’s hard not on Zoom, but it’s awful on Zoom,” he says with a grimace. McCauley, who is in his 60s, grey-haired and jocular, has spent a lifetime watching the devious twists and turns of the shapeshifting virus. Since 2009, he has been director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre in London, based at the Francis Crick Institute next to St Pancras station. And in the months leading up to the meeting, he was busy taking delivery of large numbers of boxes of carefully packaged, potentially lethal human flu virus samples from 90 centres, mostly in Europe. In a normal year – and the last two have been far from normal – the Crick receives 120 or 130 shipments, containing about 5,000 samples. Other boxes stacked ready to be shipped out contain viruses destined for labs in other countries, where scientists will compare them with their own samples. The labels are a story of friendship, colonialism and cooperation: Cyprus, Valladolid, a pre-war St Petersburg. “There are periods in which we’re very busy and periods in which we’re extremely busy,” McCauley says. He patiently explains the complexities of the virus, with just an occasional flash of suppressed irritation at this interruption to his lifesaving work. He strides briskly in his white coat between his small glass office overlooking the institute’s atrium and the dark, closed-off labs behind it. Entry to the labs is restricted whenever there is live flu virus around. In January, the trickle of flu virus samples becomes a flood. Cardboard boxes containing the evidence of its latest mutations are brought in and transferred to freezers at -80C, where they will last for a couple of weeks while lab staff get to work. For what they have to do, the word “testing” is inadequate, McCauley’s frown makes clear. It’s about “isolating the virus, propagating the virus, doing the genetic analysis, doing the antigenic analysis, doing the drug resistance analysis, on all of these,” he says. McCauley must work out how the virus is changing so that he can inform the February meeting. This year something unusual has been happening. There has hardly been any flu for the past two winters. There’s even speculation that some strains have vanished completely. But the flu hunters know better than to underestimate their enemy. If you can’t see it just now, it’s probably only hiding. Flu is a killer. It’s not just a bad cold. Man flu is – well, not flu. If you’re at work and think you’ve got flu, you probably haven’t. A proper bout will keep you in bed for days, unable to do much more than moan. Without vaccines, it would regularly scythe through the population, and occasionally cause pandemics, as it did in 1918, when it killed at least 20 million people (Covid has so far killed an estimated 6 million). And it’s a complicated, slippery foe, one that is very good at evolving or mutating to escape vaccines. There are even two types: B, a historically human variety, and A, the animal sort, which can jump species and cause pandemics. Flu B, McCauley says, “has been with us for 10,000 years”. That’s the one Hippocrates knew about. Flu A, on the other hand, originates in animals and birds. Sometimes people in daily contact with domesticated animals, such as pigs and chickens, pick up the virus. Just before Christmas 2021, 79-year-old Alan Gosling caught bird flu from his Muscovy ducks. About 100 wandered his land in Buckfastleigh, Devon; he fed them and 20 lived in the house. He was the first person in Britain to test positive for an A strain called H5N1. The tragedy for Gosling was that all the birds had to be killed and he was banned from adopting more. The good news for everyone else is that the strain was incapable of spreading from him to any other human. There has been a lot of bird flu about, in the UK and across Europe, known as “highly pathogenic avian influenza” or HPAI. In England, it started in October in wild swans in Worcester. Wild birds carry the virus; domestic birds pick it up. When it gets into poultry, whole flocks have to be slaughtered. There is always the risk that farm workers in contact with chickens, geese or ducks will contract the virus, as Gosling did. Usually, this bird strain of flu cannot be transmitted from the farm worker to any other human. The nightmare scenario is where the virus evolves again and is able to be passed on. Then you’re in potential pandemic territory. In 1918, the “Spanish flu” came from birds. This was a lethal strain of Flu A called H1N1 that killed scores of soldiers and young people at the end of the first world war – previous infections meant older generations had more immunity to it. The strain stuck around until 1957 or so, but by then it was no longer causing devastation because so many people had been exposed to it. Another strain of H1N1 caused the swine flu pandemic in 2009, which took off in Mexico and the southern US. It caused a massive scare, but far fewer deaths than feared: approximately 400 in the UK and up to half a million worldwide. Bad, but not on the scale of 1918. Pandemic flu is so deadly because it is caused by a bird or animal virus that is totally unknown to the human immune system. As with Sars-CoV2, the cause of Covid-19, viruses kill when we are not prepared for them. Seasonal flus surge in the winter months, when people are huddled together indoors and breathing each other’s air. In a normal year, up to 646,000 people worldwide die of flu. A vaccine against one flu strain won’t always defend against another, which means the shot has to contain a cocktail. The two strains of Flu A in the current vaccine are H1N1 and H3N2. The latter arrived in the 1968 pandemic that began in birds in Hong Kong and killed millions. Each of these strains has evolved different versions, which have complicated code numbers and may also be named after the place they were first spotted, such as Victoria, Yamagata, Texas or Bangladesh. Flu isn’t fussy; it will happily mutate anywhere. So how do you outwit and outflank a virus this adaptable and devilish? How can you stop it in its tracks? Global flu surveillance started in the UK. Back in 1947, the year before the WHO was launched, British virologist Christopher Andrewes, arguably the first flu detective, was involved in talks about the nascent UN organisation’s work. The Spanish flu was a horror story in living memory and tracking influenza a priority. Andrewes was asked to set up a Worldwide Influenza Centre, which he did in 1948 under the auspices of the National Institute for Medical Research in London. In 2016, the NIMR became part of the Francis Crick Institute. Obituaries of Andrewes, who died in 1988, paint him as the archetypal eccentric but brilliant British boffin. “Christopher Andrewes was characteristically seen in a tweed jacket, white hair rather dishevelled, his ruddy face expressing interest, puzzlement, concentration, or fun – never boredom,” wrote fellow virologist, David Tyrrell, who in 1965 discovered the first human coronavirus (a cause of the common cold). In 1933, Andrewes helped discover the influenza A virus. Three years later, 16-year-old Dennis Busby, who had joined the NIMR straight from school as a “lab boy”, received the first ever flu vaccination. He was not paraded for the cameras like Margaret Keenan, the first in the world to receive an approved Covid vaccine. In those days, scientific breakthroughs happened more discreetly, and a vital global breakthrough went unmarked. The stories have become folklore among the virologists who have followed Andrewes down the years – a small group you can’t help thinking were cultivated in the same petri dish. “I knew Dennis Busby,” McCauley says. “He was one of the best virological, technical guys.” Busby went on to become head technician in the bacteriology and virus division of the NIMR, which moved to Mill Hill, London, in 1950. Was it ethical to jab him with an experimental vaccine at an age when most boys are at school? “He prepared it himself,” McCauley says, almost proudly. McCauley’s predecessor-but-one as head of the Worldwide Influenza Centre was Sir John Skehel, an eminent virologist who has shown, among other things, how the influenza virus enters human cells and how antibodies can block it. Skehel ran the centre from 1975 to 1993 and was director of the NIMR until 2006. “Would you like to meet him?” McCauley asks. And there he is, the 81-year-old recipient of a string of awards and honorary degrees, across the atrium from McCauley at the Crick, working in a similar small office, cheerful and welcoming. The two chat about the difficulties in tracking flu caused by the coronavirus pandemic. “We’re trying to get some virus in from Hong Kong, but there are no flights,” McCauley says. “It’s too bad,” Skehel says. “Hong Kong is an important laboratory. They picked up H5N1 bird flu in 1997.” In the past, Hong Kong has been a window on to what flu is doing in mainland China. It has excellent scientists, often trained in the UK and well known to their British counterparts, and some of the samples they collect are from southern China. As China takes an ever firmer grip of Hong Kong, it’s uncertain whether the UK will continue to get those sorts of insights. Seven WHO global reference centres – the Crick, Atlanta and Memphis in the US, Beijing, Tokyo, Melbourne and Novosibirsk – lead flu surveillance around the world. Five are devoted to human flu; two watch for animal viruses that might jump to humans. They are on the alert for flu outbreaks in chickens in Egypt and pigs in Central America, seeing whether farm workers or families with animals get infected and start to infect others. Feeding into those WHO hubs are national influenza centres. In England, this is run by revered virologist Prof Maria Zambon at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Zambon was one of the key members of the government’s Sage advisory committee during the Covid pandemic, alongside her Imperial College colleague Prof Neil Ferguson. She is also an adviser to the WHO. And she never stops working. Decades ago, Zambon was part of the core influenza group at Mill Hill. There is a “strong historical thread” running from Andrewes to the present day, she says. And she’s not surprised so many of the people she knew a quarter of a century ago, such as Skehel, are still tackling flu. “You fall in love with working on viruses,” she says. “It was a very good start for me because I was surrounded by top-class scientists in a wonderful, collaborative environment. And you take that passion with you.” Even when the world is engulfed in a pandemic caused by a different virus, flu really matters. “Whichever way you look at it, it’s a major public health threat. And we still haven’t quite solved the problem,” Zambon says. She is heavily involved in the response to Covid at UKHSA and Imperial College, where she is co-director of the NIHR health protection research unit. Was she surprised the pandemic that shut down the world was caused not by flu, as scientists had for so long predicted, but coronavirus? “The answer to that is yes,” she says, “and no. Coronaviruses have demonstrated their potential for causing havoc over a number of years.” Zambon helped identify the first Sars virus in 2003, as one of an international team of virologists analysing samples from 436 patients in six countries. In 2012, she led the UK’s efforts to understand another coronavirus, Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome), that turned up in two people who had travelled to the UK and spread to two others. She advised the WHO on it. “With both of those episodes, globally we dodged a bullet,” she says. It’s thanks to all that historical UK influenza effort that the world is in a better place to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. Not only is surveillance strong, but so is the UK’s ability to assess how well vaccines are working through the matching of data on immunisation and illness. “We have a vaccine effectiveness system for Covid vaccines that is virtually second to none,” she says. Zambon’s team at the national influenza centre sends the Crick “one or two examples of things that are absolutely representative. And then if we see anything unusual, or a bit weird, we’ll give it to them as well. So they are getting a kind of digest of viruses from us.” Each of the devolved UK administrations does its own collection and analysis of flu samples, and sends McCauley those they consider interesting. There can be variations in what you find even within regions, says Dr Catherine Moore, who heads flu surveillance at Public Health Wales. Her field is molecular diagnostics, investigating changes in human, viral and microbial genomes to diagnose diseases. She swung into action at the start of the Covid pandemic, developing a molecular assay diagnostics test (PCR) to detect its genetic material (RNA) within a month of the coronavirus being recognised. Moore knows Zambon and McCauley well, and shares their enthusiasm. She is “the current custodian” of a system that has been running for 40 years, she says. It’s “an absolute joy” to be even a small cog in the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). What matters is not the number of flu samples they collect, she says, but gathering high-quality data that can indicate the drift of virus strains, potentially into something different and troublesome. They operate within the hospital system in Wales: “What we want to look at is the severe end of the spectrum.” That’s all the way from a one-night stay to intensive care. Moore has 44 GP practices also feeding in test results. In England, there are 245, organised through a network run by the Royal College of General Practitioners. Since 1967, GPs have collated reports of flu diagnoses from selected practices around the country. In 1994, Zambon was involved in helping with the transition to a system where patients’ flu samples are dispatched to centralised public health laboratories for virological testing. GPs used to be at the sharp end of all of this, swabbing their patients’ throats for flu virus in the way we all now know how to do. Flu is easy to catch, so it was a high-risk occupation. Covid has changed things dramatically, and now people in low-risk groups with flu-like symptoms are able to request home test kits and submit their own samples. “One of the things the pandemic has done is ensure that much less explanation is needed now on how to take a swab,” says Prof Simon de Lusignan, an academic GP at the University of Oxford who runs the network organising sample collection in England. A charity called TakeATestUK dispatches the flu kit. The patient does the throat swab and posts it off to Zambon’s lab teams for analysis. GPs still feel they need to see some patients in person – such as older people who may have a chest infection, and small babies – but others will be told they are best staying warm, drinking fluids and getting over it at home. The vaccine strain selection meetings at the WHO started in the early 1970s and take place twice a year. In February, they recommend the virus cocktail to go into the northern hemisphere vaccine, with a meeting six months later for the southern hemisphere. The meeting used to recommend three strains. Now, manufacturing technology has improved to accommodate four. It is difficult stuff. Not every virus strain can be grown successfully – traditionally in chicken eggs – in the quantity needed (it is then deactivated). Usually, the committee gets it right, pretty much. “We normally say it’s right something like 70 to 80% of the time, because what you’re trying to do is to match a vaccine strain selection with a moving target,” Zambon says. But it’s an educated bet. You can see the runners and riders – the strains that are most prevalent in the world – but they can change within six months. “That’s what you need the crystal ball for,” she says. “Some of the time, there’ll be a runner that pops up by August or September that was not present in January or February and if that runner emerges, and is successful against the other riders, then you have a mismatch. It does happen, and it can be painful when it does.” A mismatch is the nightmare. The experts got it wrong in 2014-15. The vaccine protected against Flu B and the H1N1 strain of Flu A, but not against H3N2. In February 2014, the Geneva meeting had opted for the Texas strain of H3N2, kickstarting manufacture of the vaccine across Europe and the US. But as early as March, the flu watchers could see that a different strain of H3N2, from Switzerland, was spreading faster. “It dominated in the winter of 2014-15,” McCauley says. It was too late to switch horses. If vaccine production had been stopped to make a change in the component strains, there would not have been enough of it. That year, there were an estimated 43,900 excess winter deaths in England and Wales – the largest number since 1999-2000. Something odd is happening with Flu B, too. For some time, the two B strains in the vaccine have been Victoria and Yamagata. Now Yamagata seems to have disappeared. “At the start of 2018, half the intensive care unit beds in the UK were filled with people with B Yamagata lineage viruses,” McCauley says. “Now it might have shot its bolt. We haven’t seen a B Yamagata lineage virus for over a year in these laboratories.” What’s going on? The experts don’t know, exactly. The flu hunters trail influenza but can never get ahead of it. And right now, predicting what it will do next is difficult. Strange things are happening. Not only has Yamagata vanished, but China has reported only Flu B and no Flu A, the animal variety – so the speculation is that it’s not circulating. And in the US, neither Yamagata nor one of the substrains of H3N2 (which doesn’t have a place name) has been spotted since March 2020. The answer must have to do with the Covid pandemic. McCauley produces a slide that dramatically demonstrates what happened in the winter of 2020-21, the first of the pandemic. Flu went into lockdown; there wasn’t any to speak of. Social distancing and mask-wearing thwarted not just coronavirus but flu, too. At the Crick, they were able to clear a backlog of work. They hadn’t been able to do that since 2008. “Last year, we did have periods when we didn’t have stuff to do,” McCauley says with a grin. But if there are fewer reports of flu, is that really because of all the social distancing and mask-wearing? Or is it that people are not going to the GP or hospital and instead are staying at home in bed with a raging fever unnoticed? Moore in Wales says it’s been hard to read. “Because of the pandemic, a lot of our surveillance systems have been disrupted, and particularly in the community.” But, on the whole, it seems there genuinely is less flu. “It’s been quite remarkable. I don’t think I’ve seen anything like this in my entire career,” she says. In 2019, before the pandemic hit, things were looking dodgy. “We were in a really brisk season,” she says. There were four H3N2 substrains circulating in Wales, at least two of which were not great matches for the strain in the vaccine. Moore was expecting a tricky winter. “Then suddenly Sars [Covid-19] arrived,” she says. Because of mitigations such as social distancing, masks and working from home, “flu stopped circulating. We’ve had two years of basically nothing. No signal at all for influenza.” It’s no different in the rest of Europe. Flu can vanish – and flu can come roaring back. McCauley and the committee have chosen their strains for next winter. It includes a B Yamagata-type strain (Phuket) in spite of its apparent disappearance, along with H1N1 (Victoria), H3N2 (Darwin) and B (Austria). “It is far too early to conclude it [Yamagata] is extinct,” he says. And not much flu means there is less natural immunity against it. People don’t have the antibodies from getting ill; at least, not the antibodies from recent strains. All of us have some baseline immunity to flu. People born before about 1957 have some resilience to H1N1. It lurked for 40 or so years after the 1918 pandemic, altered in substrains, but older people have some general protection against it all the same. That’s why, in 2009 – the swine flu pandemic, which was also H1N1 – it was working people, aged 25 to 35, who died. Have I heard of “original antigenic sin”, Moore asks. The first flu strain you came into contact with is what your immune system remembers best, she explains. “That’s your immune system’s memory. If you encountered H1N1 as a child, you will be better protected against strains of that than against those of H3N2. And those born in the few years before the 1968-69 Hong Kong flu pandemic are likely to have more immunity to H3N2, which caused it. So H3N2 hits elderly people harder.” Flu travels the world. It may start in Hong Kong or in Bangladesh, but there are no border controls. Global cooperation is essential, and that includes sharing samples of virus – carefully. McCauley won’t send flu virus to countries whose labs are anything less than highly secure. He mentions a country that asked for samples from the UK for comparison purposes. He wasn’t impressed with their safety protocols. “I said, ‘Would you accept Ebola? Would you do this with Ebola?’ And they went, ‘No, no, we wouldn’t do that.’ I said, ‘OK, so Ebola kills 70% of people. And this virus kills 40% of people that it infects. What’s the difference?’” The flu hunters have decades of experience but there are always anxious moments. Moore is concerned about Alan Gosling and his Muscovy ducks. The ducks were infected because, while human flu is at low levels, bird flu in the UK is not. “We’re right in the middle of a massive epidemic in our birds in the UK,” she says. She cannot understand the lack of interest. “We have a human infection from it and birds are dying. Nobody seems to care, but it’s part of the same family of viruses. I find it remarkable that flu has been denigrated almost to just a cold. It’s not. It kills people every year, and it’s distressing.” After the coronavirus pandemic is over, she says, people need to be reminded to take flu seriously. In some respects, we are getting on top of flu. Conall Watson, a UKHSA epidemiologist, talks of “really positive developments in flu vaccinations”. He means the introduction of the adjuvant influenza vaccine, which gives older people’s immune systems a boost to help them respond and produce antibodies to the strains in the jab. “We’ve got evidence that it is preventing hospitalisations, but one of the really big steps the UK took was the introduction of a school-age and toddler vaccination programme,” he says, “with the idea of using vaccines to reduce community transmission.” And the mRNA technology that has proved so successful in the Covid pandemic, used in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, is likely to be the future for flu vaccines as well. The companies are now looking to see how they can adapt it. We know mRNA vaccines can be fairly swiftly altered if a serious new coronavirus variant turns up. We could see a scenario where both the Covid and flu vaccines are redesigned every year, depending on the prevailing strains. Will we ever get to a point where we don’t have to worry about flu? “No,” Zambon says, without hesitation, “because the natural reservoir for influenza A is wild birds.” They take the virus around the globe and there is nothing we can do about it. “So it will always be a threat to the human population.” Which means that our best hope will continue to be vaccines. We are in the hands of the flu hunters.",News/Society,Bless you!

3/19/2022,"The wife of a Russian businessman who at one stage pleaded guilty to defrauding the Kazakh government out of $4m (£3m) has stepped down as a patron of the Tate and from a prestigious advisory board at Somerset House, where she was a major donor. Maria Adonyeva, who has a London-based charitable foundation and has been pictured as recently as 2018 on her husband’s yacht with close friends, including the actor Melanie Griffith, has given at least £380,000 in the past two years to Somerset House, where she sat on the arts centre’s development advisory board. Her husband is Sergey Adonyev, a Russian telecoms multimillionaire whose Bulgarian citizenship – which he had acquired in return for a promise of investment – was revoked in 2019 over the fraud conviction in the US. In September he was successful in having that guilty plea and conviction overturned. Somerset House said Adonyeva had stepped down from its trust’s development advisory board after consultations on Tuesday. The Tate also said this week that she had stepped back as a platinum donor, a scheme that provides the highest level of patron engagement, with premier access to directors and curators, high-profile artists, leading collectors and art specialists. Somerset House said it had known Adonyeva since 2018 but had never had dealings with her. It conducted due diligence before receiving any donation from the Adonyeva Foundation, it said. It added: “Based on the information we had at the time, trustees felt able to accept financial support from the foundation to support Somerset House’s residencies and cultural programme. We have no contractual agreement for any further support.” Tate also said it never had any contact with Sergey Adonyev. The couple have been separated since 2016 . In 1998, Adonyev was convicted in the US of defrauding the Kazakh government of $4m through false sales of Cuban sugar. He was sentenced to 30 months in jail, much of which he had already served, before he was, in effect, deported to Russia the following year. Ranked by the Russian edition of Forbes magazine as Russia’s 114th richest man in 2020, he is the former co-owner of the Russian telecoms operator Yota and has had ties to Sergei Chemezov, the head of the Russian state defence corporation Rostec and a former KGB general close to Vladimir Putin. A smiling Putin was pictured watching as Chemezov and Adonyev sign an agreement paving the way for Adonyev’s company to make inroads into an already mature telecoms market. Chemezov is facing sanctions in the UK and EU, where Spanish authorities seized his yacht on Tuesday. Adonyeva describes herself as a businesswoman, philanthropist and art collector. Her Adonyeva Foundation, a charity, names her as the chair and her Eton-educated son as a trustee. It donated £699,000 to charity in the year to September 2020 and on its website lauds its support for Somerset House, saying it allowed the art centre to engage in “an ambitious commissioning programme”, including the exhibitions Get Up, Stand Up, Now and 24/7. The website appears to have removed most of its content this week. Sergey Adonyev is not subject to sanctions. The affair at Somerset House comes after controversies at other arts institutions in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the focus on wealthy Russian-linked donors. Transparency International said: “Prestigious British institutions should be aware that the legitimacy they give to their patrons is much sought after by those with reputations to burnish. While galleries and cultural centres are not regulated for money-laundering purposes, they should be really careful about where they’re taking their big donations from. “The last thing the arts wants to do right now is be associated unwittingly with those close to the Putin regime. These institutions can protect their integrity by making a positive statement and publicly refusing support from individuals with dubious pasts and associations.”",Arts/Culture,Somerset House donor married to oligarch quits board,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/19/somerset-house-donor-married-to-oligarch-quits-board
3/19/2022,"Pressure is mounting on Koch Industries, the conglomerate run by the rightwing billionaire Charles Koch, to pull out of Russia after it was revealed it was continuing to do business in Russia through three wholly-owned subsidiaries. Hundreds of companies including Coca-Cola, KPMG, McDonald’s, Netflix and Starbucks have paused operations in Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. But, as news site Popular Information revealed last week, three Koch subsidiaries are still operating in the country. “Koch Industries is shamefully continuing to do business in Putin’s Russia and putting their profits ahead of defending democracy,” the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, and Senator Ron Wyden, said in a joint statement. “As the democracies of the world make huge sacrifices to punish Russia for Putin’s illegal and vicious invasion of Ukraine, Koch Industries continues to profit off of Putin’s regime.” “It must stop,” Schumer wrote on Twitter, adding that he and Wyden were “exploring legislation to add Russia to existing laws denying foreign tax credits for taxes paid to North Korea & Syria.” Koch has defended its Russian operations. The company has three subsidiaries still operating in the country: Guardian Industries, a glass manufacturer; Molex, an electronic components manufacturer; and Koch Engineered Solutions, a provider of industrial products. In a statement released on Wednesday Dave Robertson, Koch president, condemned the invasion. “The horrific and abhorrent aggression against Ukraine is an affront to humanity,” he wrote. But he said the company would not “walk away” from its employees. “Koch company Guardian Industries operates two glass manufacturing facilities in Russia that employ about 600 people. We have no other physical assets in Russia, and outside of Guardian, employ 15 individuals in the country. While Guardian’s business in Russia is a very small part of Koch, we will not walk away from our employees there or hand over these manufacturing facilities to the Russian government so it can operate and benefit from them (which is what the Wall Street Journal has reported they would do). Doing so would only put our employees there at greater risk and do more harm than good,” he wrote. Robertson said the company was “complying with all applicable sanctions, laws and regulations” and would continue to monitor the situation. The statement was released on the same day that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made an address to Congress. “All American companies must leave their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood,” said Zelenskiy. The Kansas-based conglomerate – the second-largest private company in the US – is one of 40 companies “digging in” and refusing to leave Russia, according to a tally compiled by the Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and his research team. Popular Information also revealed last week that a network of pundits and groups funded by Koch has been publicly advocating against imposing economic sanctions on Russia.",News/US news,Pressure mounts on Koch Industries to halt business in Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/19/koch-industries-russia-business-pressure
3/19/2022,"What is bullying?It’s a sustained pattern of aggression by a person with more power, targeting someone with less power. The key, says Stella O’Malley, author of a ground-breaking new book, Bully-Proof Kids, is that it’s repeated behaviour. But beneath this simple definition lies a complex, multilayered situation that can be exceptionally tricky to unpack. What is the power, and where does it come from? With children, says O’Malley, it’s often that they have more social status, or have been led to believe they do. One very big issue, which she returns to time and again in her book and in our conversation, is that bullying is always about more than what’s going on with two people: the bully and the target. What about the children O’Malley calls “wingmen”, the bully’s supporters, the kids who think the bully is the bee’s knees and want to stay in their favour? What’s happening with the kids watching silently – the bystanders? Who is seeing what’s happening, when it all starts to kick off, and getting out fast? Who’s calling out the injustice? To understand bullying, you have to see the whole picture. Because, says O’Malley, bullying is about absolutely everyone in the group, room, office or playground; even the bystanders – those who do or say nothing when bullying is taking place – because, as the German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, not to speak is to speak; not to act is to act. Could any kid be a bully – and a target?Yes, says O’Malley. “I’ve never met anyone who I’ve thought could never be a bully, or anyone who could never be a target. The truth is that every single one of us has our shadow side – and it’s not until we can acknowledge it that we become better people.” Bullying behaviour in children, says O’Malley, tends to be very animalistic, with a strong instinct in many kids to join the pack. “Maybe it takes 18 years to civilise ourselves, and that’s where parents come in. There’s so much we can do to make a difference.” What can parents do?The most important thing, says O’Malley, is to pay attention to your child, so you can work out what their vulnerabilities are. You know your child better than anyone: what are their emotional needs? Do they need love and belonging, or crave power, status and recognition from others? The first of these could be a passive, gentle child who might be more vulnerable to bullying, or to being recruited by a bully to be one of their supporters. Similarly, if your child needs power and recognition – and that’s a great cocktail for success in many sectors – it can easily trigger bullying behaviour, and as a parent you need to be aware of that, and active in how you manage it. “A kid like this has wonderful strengths, but they need to learn empathy,” she says. “If you can nurture a sense of kindness in that child, help them understand how others are feeling, you’ll be combatting their bullying tendencies. Every child, every human being, has their flaws. Bullying has become demonised, but children can easily tip into it, and we need to help them out of it.” And the good thing, says O’Malley, is that it’s relatively easy to help a primary-school-age child out of being a bully. “They’re primed to be told how to behave, and they can learn to be different.” What if the parents are bullies themselves?Sometimes you come across a family where everyone is a bully: the parents, the older siblings, who bully the younger kids, and the younger kids, who bully others at school. These families are very difficult to help; but they’re also quite rare. What’s much more common is individualistic behaviour by parents that could set their child up to be a bully. What sort of behaviour should I look out for?There’s a certain sort of kid, warns O’Malley, who goes to school with a supercilious presumption that they’re better than the others. Make sure your child isn’t that child: the idea that your offspring is inherently smarter, better looking and more skilled across the board, is, in fact, a facet of your own dark side – and transmitting it to your child will lead to big problems. The much better approach is to think from the point of view of other children, and to encourage your child to do likewise. “When asking your child about their day, don’t just ask about lessons and what they had for lunch,” says O’Malley. “Ask them, did everyone have a friend at playtime today? And if they say someone was left out, ask them did they give that person a smile, or go to ask whether they wanted to play?” O’Malley prefers the term “tricky people” to “bullies”, and the truth about tricky people is this: they’re all around, and they’ll continue to be all around, right through your life. One of the biggest gifts a parent can give their child, O’Malley believes, is the skills to handle tricky people. “It’s not about being big; it’s about being clever,” she says. “It’s about your strategy, it’s about how you deal with these people. If you teach your kid that some people are pure evil, and will beat you, it’s not empowering. But if you teach them to recognise the tricky person, to be wary, to work things out around them: that’s empowering. You’ve taught them something massive.” Who are ‘upstanders’?There is another group and it’s one O’Malley wants to emphasise: the upstanders (she’s one herself; indeed her book is a kind of upstanding writ large). “The upstanders weigh in. They’re wired to weigh in – even when it’s nothing to do with them,” she says. “They can be really annoying people, actually.” But upstanders deflate the bully or bullies and the important thing to realise, and to make sure your child realises, is that it can be a very subtle role. “If you’re on public transport and someone is giving someone else racial abuse, even by just making eye contact with the target, and giving them a supportive look, helps reduce the bullying. Crossing the carriage to stand by them, maybe engaging them in conversation about the journey or the weather, will help reduce the power of the bully.” O’Malley’s mantra is to embrace the role of the upstander – and in schools in particular, she thinks nurturing an upstanding culture would make a huge difference. Has digitisation changed the nature of bullying, or has it merely given it a new arena?Bullying in the digital age is the same as the old, says O’Malley, but there are important differences. First, the digital world has created a much quicker path to the dehumanisation of the target – and dehumanisation is the horror we are trying to avoid. It’s very hard, says O’Malley, to bring a child back from being dehumanised: which is why she advises that, if you feel it’s happening to your child in any setting, and if the school or authorities aren’t working with you urgently to tackle it, you need to get the child out quick. But digitisation is already working to dehumanise people: huge swathes of social media, for example, are about creating a vision of someone who’s very far removed from the person they are in real life. On social media, celebrities can give the aura of being so successful, so good-looking, so much the inhabitants of another universe, that it’s easy to turn on them. The tragedy of Caroline Flack is one example O’Malley gives: “We’ve created a culture where to press ‘like’ makes you part of the mob, makes you a bystander. We need to be a lot more conscious of that.” Can anything good come of bullying?Absolutely, says O’Malley. Bullying is unpleasant, but it happens; and working out what’s going on, and going deeper into our own roles and our children’s roles, is a character-enhancing exercise. “Whether your child is the bully or the target, the bystander or the wingman, they can learn from it, and they can come through. Being on the receiving end of bullying is a traumatic situation, and like all trauma you can come out of it stronger, especially if you have good support. It can make a bigger person of an individual. It can give them a view of the human condition that they didn’t have. And learning to manage it can lead to a better understanding of the tricky people who your child will go on encountering right through their life.” Bully-Proof Kids: Practical Tools to Help Your Child to Grow Up Confident, Resilient and Strong by Stella O’Malley is published by Swift Press on 31 March.

3/19/2022,"For decades, television held the period drama to the rule of three Ms: make it love-shy, make it British, make it unapologetically white. Anything that fell short of this standard risked never making it to air. When Netflix announced plans to develop a one-hour show based on the Bridgerton novel series in 2018, they appeared to have it all wrong. Not only was bestselling author Julia Quinn – a New Englander! – playing Jane Austen and spilling sex all over the page, but her adaptation would feature a multiracial cast. It had all the ingredients of a giant flop, and might well have been if someone other than Shonda Rhimes had been stirring the pot. With Bridgerton’s second season premiering this Friday, viewers will be logging on to Netflix in droves to see if the series was indeed a worthy rival to Downton Abbey, or if it merely exploited our collective cabin fever during the pandemic. But if there’s reason to believe the series is more than a fleeting guilty pleasure, it’s because few showrunners have a better track record of spinning TV gold than Rhimes – the 52-year-old Chicago native who has ruled the small screen for the better part of the past two decades. The hot streak has continued at Netflix – where her initial offerings have her reigning supreme. Not only has Bridgerton gone on to runaway success, zooming to No 1 in 76 countries, with a viewership of 82m households on the way to becoming the second-most watched series by total watch time on the platform. But Rhimes’s follow-up, Inventing Anna – about the soon-to-be deported SoHo grifter Anna Delvey – has proved to be a cultural phenomenon as well, seizing on the current scammer culture zeitgeist. Of course for those versed in Rhimes’s work, with its hot-mess characters and soaring monologues, doubtless none of this comes as a shock. If there’s one thing Rhimes knows how to make, it’s eminently binge-worthy TV. Rhimes, of course, is the big brain behind Grey’s Anatomy, the soapy hospital drama that debuted on ABC as a mid-season replacement in 2005 only to become one of the longest-running scripted shows on American television. (In January, ABC renewed Grey’s for a 19th season.) The series minted the careers of Sandra Oh, Katherine Heigl and Jesse Williams; most incredibly, it established 52-year-old Ellen Pompeo – the titular Grey – as top earner in a medium that favours much younger up-and-comers. Grey’s even spawned two spin-offs: the firehouse-based Station 19 (renewed for a sixth season in January) and the medical office drama Private Practice, which enjoyed a six-season run before getting the axe in 2013. But Rhimes was only just getting warmed up. After Grey’s she came out with Scandal, the Kerry Washington-led series based on a real-life DC politico; and How to Get Away with Murder, the fast-paced legal drama that won Viola Davis an Emmy. For years, Rhimes had ABC’s Thursday nights all to herself, with Grey’s, Scandal and Murder all airing the same evening. Altogether, she was creating at a pace that even the prolific actor and director Tyler Perry would struggle to keep up with, producing about 70 hours of television a year while banking in excess of $2bn for parent company Disney. Despite her rainmaking, Rhimes was grossly underpaid at the network – a fact that became apparent during their negotiations for a multiyear extension in 2017. The final straw came when she asked a high-ranking executive for an extra all-inclusive pass to Disneyland. The alleged reply (“Don’t you have enough?”) all but sent her running to Netflix – where she’d be free of network TV’s tight shackles. That August, she signed on for a reported $150m – a bargain sum that does not include the lucrative streaming rights fees for the Grey’s, Scandal and Murder archives. For the past decade Netflix has noisily gone about poaching top talent from its rivals, tossing juicy nine-figure lures at the Star Wars director JJ Abrams, Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and DB Weiss, and fellow Disney macher Kenya Barris; in 2018, the streaming service reeled in the Fox hitmaker Ryan Murphy for a reported $300m that put Netflix on the hook to take whatever he decides to bring to them. The deal was described as “as close to absolute freedom as anyone is likely to get without owning the studio or being Christopher Nolan”. To date Murphy appears to be saving his best stuff for television. While his American Crime Story and American Horror Story franchises continue to create buzz for Fox and the recently cancelled ball culture drama Pose at least drew critical acclaim, Murphy’s Netflix offerings have mostly been thin soup. The Politician, about student government, is a watered-down remix of the 1999 Reese Witherspoon classic Election. His show Hollywood plays a bit too fast and loose with the facts while following a group of fictional aspirants through the industry’s postwar golden age. Halston, a focused retrospective on the life of the fabled clothing designer, was panned as overly glib. Only Ratched, which was viewed by 48 million people during its first four weeks according to Netflix, could credibly be called a Murphy hit for the streaming service – and it was no doubt boosted by Miloš Forman’s source material and the lead performances of Emmy winners Sarah Paulson and Cynthia Nixon. Murphy’s other Netflix projects were just as loaded with star power; Gwyneth Paltrow stars in The Politician, Jim Parsons is a central figure in Hollywood and Ewan McGregor won an Emmy playing Halston. And yet these series come and go without really leaving viewers wanting. Meanwhile, Rhimes repaid Netflix’s investment in her from the start. After debuting on Christmas 2020, Bridgerton became the most-watched series on Netflix even as it forced young adults into the uncomfortable position of having to watch sex scenes with their parents. This Is An Official Warning – Do Not Watch “Bridgerton” With Your Parents, advised BuzzFeed last January. It made a superstar out of Regé-Jean Page, now an odds-on favourite to replace Daniel Craig as the next Bond. Julia Garner is in the midst of a similarly sudden star turn on Inventing Anna. The out-of-the-box success is as much a credit to Rhimes’s eye for pulpy stories as her confidence to let others bring those stories to screen – with Shondaland alum Chris Van Dusen taking the reins on Bridgerton. For all her success Rhimes has been candid about how much she envies Murphy and the confidence with which he inhabits his Hollywood showrunner persona. But it’s clear Netflix values the understated self-possession that undergirds Rhimes’s near faultless track record. Last July she agreed to a multiyear extension with the streamer (bringing her more in line with Murphy) to provide feature films, gaming content and other offerings. Another producer might be scared to stray outside their lane and risk the possibility of crashing and burning. But Rhimes clearly does her best work when she pushes the limits.",Arts/Television & radio,Netflix royalty: Shonda Rhimes’s winning streak continues with Bridgerton and Inventing Anna,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/19/shonda-rhimes-netflix-bridgerton-inventing-anna
3/19/2022,"The British public have been asked to track flowering fruit trees to help determine whether climate change is changing blooming patterns, in one of the largest studies of its kind. The University of Reading and Oracle for Research have developed a fruit recording website where citizen scientists can easily post their findings. People will initially be asked to record the flowering cherry and plum trees near them, with apple trees soon to follow. Scientists fear that climate change may be causing trees to flower earlier than when insect pollinators are most active. Pollinators such as bees, hoverflies, wasps and moths have evolved symbiotically with the plants they pollinate. Now that plants are thought to be flowering earlier because of warmer weather, the yearly emergence of these insects may be too late. If this is the case, it could mean fruit trees such as apple, pear, cherry and plum are adversely affected, as they rely on insect pollination to produce their fruit. It could also harm insect populations if they arrive after plants have already bloomed. Chris Wyver, the PhD researcher at the University of Reading who is leading the Fruitwatch project, said: “We need members of the public to go out into gardens, allotments, orchards or parks and tell us what they see. We want as many eyes on as many trees as possible to tell us if climate change really is having an impact on fruit tree pollination. If it is, then action will be required to prevent a potentially significant impact on fruit production. “Pollinators and fruit trees falling out of sync could mean supply issues, and more expensive and lower-quality fruit. Pollinators do an incredible job for the planet, and if insects are unable to pollinate fruit trees then something else will have to – potentially humans.” People are asked to submit details of fruit trees they see and when they are in bloom. This information will be uploaded into an interactive map, and will show how climate change is affecting flowering times compared with pollinator activity. It will also give a clear picture of how blooming times differ between regions. Information required will include the type of tree, its location, and the stage of flowering, as well as photos, which will also be shared on the map. Scientists hope to use the information to target conservation action to the most affected areas and help with insect pollination in orchards. Pollinators are estimated to contribute more than £36m a year to the UK’s apple production alone. Oracle’s senior research advocate Rich Pitts said: “This is a practical project that anyone in the UK can take part in. The project has been warmly received and we are expecting to receive lots of records. If we get 50,000 records the team will be very happy and we’ll owe a huge debt of gratitude to the UK’s budding citizen scientists.”",News/Environment,Plum job: UK public asked to track fruit trees for climate study,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/19/plum-job-uk-public-track-fruit-trees-climate-study-fruitwatch

3/19/2022,"Since his premiership nearly sank a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson has done more foreign travel and frantic diplomacy than in all his previous years as prime minister combined. He has made phone calls almost daily to Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the war with Russia rages, and won praise from the Ukrainian president during his emotive video address to the House of Commons. And he has flitted to Kyiv, Munich, Poland, Estonia, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, as he tries to position himself as an international powerbroker in the new post-Brexit order, galvanising action against the Kremlin and dealing with the consequent shortfall in non-Russian energy supplies. Johnson is also likely to attend a Nato summit next week in Brussels, alongside the US president, Joe Biden, but the American leader is not currently thought to have any plans to make a detour to London. “It’s almost like he’s worried he won’t have many more opportunities to play the international statesman and his next tour is going to be on the lecture circuit,” said one unsympathetic Tory MP who also pointed to Johnson being forced to make friends with “second-tier” leaders rather than Biden, Olaf Scholz or Emmanuel Macron. But some in Johnson’s party are impressed. Some Conservative backbenchers claim to have been won round by Johnson’s decision to apply himself proactively to the international crisis triggered by Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine. At least two – out of more than a dozen – Conservative MPs have now withdrawn letters of no confidence in their leader, saying now is not the time for a change. And Johnson himself appears to have gained new vigour, after coming so close to being ousted. Although he was widely seen as a chaotic and gaffe-prone foreign secretary, with insufficient grasp of diplomatic details, those close to the prime minister say it is a part of the job that interests him much more than domestic policy detail. As a politician with a lifelong obsession with Winston Churchill, Johnson appears to be in his element in the role of war leader – despite the UK not being directly involved in the conflict. One person present on his latest trip to the Gulf said he appeared far happier this week meeting world leaders and having his photograph taken than he was “sitting behind a desk”. “This could be like Boris’s Falklands moment,” said Ryan Shorthouse, the chief executive of the Conservative thinktank Bright Blue. “The polls seem to indicate that the fall in support for the Conservatives seems to have stopped as a result of the crisis in eastern Europe, which would indicate that the public consciousness has moved on from the breaking of rules inside No 10.” He added that the crisis had “taken away the story from Partygate”, just as the Covid pandemic “masked some of the consequences of Brexit”. Like his foreign secretary, Liz Truss, whose Instagram profile channels Margaret Thatcher with pictures of her driving a tank, Johnson has used the international crisis to burnish his image. It has given him endless opportunities to be pictured in front of union flags, walking down red carpets and shaking hands with dignitaries. On many of the trips, journalists have not been given access, apart from one broadcaster and one wire reporter, so there is little visibility about what Johnson is doing – or promising – to his fellow international leaders while out of the country. For his visit to Ukraine in early February, the media were told there was “no room” on the 300-seat taxpayer-funded plane. And for his visits to UAE and Saudi Arabia, where Johnson was explicitly going to seek deals for more oil and investment, he also excluded the majority of the press. Accompanying him was Gerry Grimstone, a trade minister who is a former adviser to the Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and who has had deep business links with the Middle East. Part of the prime minister’s buoyancy is because his allies believe the plot against his premiership is over, with one telling the Daily Mail on Thursday that he would not lose a leadership challenge even if handed a penalty by the police. They are now confident he will fight the next general election and win. One Tory MP with a tin ear told the Guardian that the war in Ukraine meant “the mood is now really good in the party”. Domestically, Johnson’s activities also have the feel of a soft relaunch of his premiership, with the Tory chair saying a two-year election campaign would start from this May. The prime minister is speaking on Friday at the Scottish Conservatives’ conference, before heading to Blackpool on Saturday for the Tory spring conference – the first time in years that the event has been billed as a major event. The aim is to convince the party faithful that Johnson’s premiership is worth fighting for as the crucial May elections approach and to entrench him as the incumbent candidate, putting him back in campaign mode. In his foreword to the spring conference guide, the prime minister said his argument would be “an optimistic vision for the future of our country”. Those keeping a close eye on the public find a more mixed picture, however. Some Conservative MPs report voters may be distracted by the pressures of the cost of living crisis and worry over the Ukraine-Russia conflict, but many have not changed their minds that the prime minister should have resigned. “They’re saying he’s done better in relation to Ukraine but they haven’t forgotten the cake,” said one veteran Tory former cabinet minister. Robert Hayward, a Conservative peer and elections expert, said the impact of the Ukraine crisis on Johnson’s reputation “has two effects: one is the leadership effect, and there are signs that Macron and, to a lesser extent, Biden are having the same benefit. And then there’s a second effect, the obliteration factor, which is that by keeping on the page dealing with an international drama such as this, you hide other things.” Luke Tryl, a former Conservative aide and a UK director of More in Common, who has been carrying out regular focus groups with voters across the country, said the crisis “definitely changes the subject”. “Whereas at the start of February, the first thing people would come to when you asked them about stuff they’d seen in the news was Partygate, now, everyone says Ukraine,” he said. But he was not convinced the public were warming to Johnson the international statesman. “Some of the stuff that people quite liked about Boris, they now see as a little bit of a liability when we’re dealing with an invasion, a major international event. In some red wall groups we’ve had people say things like, ‘What do the other world leaders think of the fact that he doesn’t do his hair?’” He added: “If you prompt them on Partygate, they come back with the same level of crossness. It’s suspended it in time. If you ask about what should happen if he gets a fixed-penalty fine, people normally say some version of, ‘Well he obviously should resign; I don’t think he will though.’”",News/Politics,Don’t mention the Partygate: Boris Johnson is buoyant on the world stage,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/19/dont-mention-the-partygate-boris-johnson-is-buoyant-on-the-world-stage

Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer until the dal is cooked – this will take roughly 45 minutes, so the chana are tender but still have some bite. (You could also soak the chana overnight, which would cut down on the cooking time). While the dal cooks, warm a frying pan over a medium heat, then add the coconut flakes and stir for a couple of minutes until toasted and browned. Set aside in a bowl, then return the pan to the heat with a tablespoon of mustard oil. Add the onions and ginger and cook, stirring occasionally, for six to eight minutes, until the onions have browned a little at the edges and softened. Add the chilli and garlic, cook for another minute, then turn off the heat. When the dal has been cooking for 35 minutes, stir through the onion mixture and continue to simmer. Once the dal is cooked, prepare the seasoning. Put two tablespoons of mustard oil in a small pan over a low-medium heat, then warm the bay leaves, fenugreek, mustard and onion seeds in the oil for two to three minutes, until the mustard seeds start to pop.

3/19/2022,"The Covid-19 pandemic has been brutally tough on America’s homeless. Already difficult patterns of living, often just survival, were abruptly disrupted as the city emptied and shut down during spikes. Shelters and food pantries no longer functioned in a predictable fashion. Stores and 24-hour subways closed and the homeless were often and conveniently blamed for a wave of robbery and violence. But last weekend, matters became bleaker still: the terrifying specter of a gunman on the prowl who over the last two weeks shot five homeless men sleeping on the streets of Washington DC and New York, killing one in each city. Law enforcement officials described the man as a serial killer; the mayors of both cities offered a reward for information and issued advisories to get off the streets, a puzzling directive since the streets are home to the killers’ targets. The alert was withdrawn by Tuesday when federal agents took 30-year-old Gerald Brevard into custody in south-east Washington. No motive has been given, and he has yet to be charged. But the casual nature of the extreme violence – captured on surveillance video – has underscored the vulnerability of tens of thousands of people for whom rest is a sporadic luxury and safety relative in a city that never sleeps. “It took hours and tons of stress to make even five dollars” during the Covid shutdowns, said Sophie, a 25-year-old woman who has lived on the streets around Washington Square Park in Manhattan. “There was nothing open, no one on the streets, nothing in the garbage cans and you couldn’t even get water after eight during the curfew. It was scary and crazy.” But it was also safer than now. In the 18 months since, as the city has lurched back to life, the metropolis has been hit by a crime spike not seen since the 1990s, including murder and assault, making policing a hot-button political issue. In New York, Mayor Eric Adams has reinstated a controversial plainclothes “anti-gun unit” that targets illegal firearms and gang activity. Increased police presence in subways and trains, a refuge for the homeless, came after an Asian healthcare worker, Michelle Go, was pushed under a train by a man who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and hospitalized 20 times. A number of other incidents followed, with eight people over a weekend in February punched, stabbed, slashed, robbed, beaten with a pipe, or threatened with a hatchet. Each further blurred the line between victim and victimizer. “It has created the perception that homeless people are violent and dangerous, and that has become the focus,” said Charles King, CEO of Housing Works, a New York housing charity originally set up to help people living with HIV. Former governor Andrew Cuomo shut down the subway system at night during Covid, exacerbating a crisis for often seriously mentally ill New Yorkers. “They said they were cleaning the subways, but they were as much doing to get people off the trains. But you can’t just shove people out of the system if you don’t have a place they’re willing to stay,” King says. Advocates for the homeless say policing policies often fail to take into account their needs. The previous New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, re-designated several hotels in wealthy white neighborhoods as homeless shelters, triggering a backlash from property owners. “There was an uproar, and the mayor responded by moving people back in congregate shelters, which are a health hazard,” King said. “It wasn’t a surprise to see that homeless in the shelters got Covid and died at a much higher rate than people in the rest of the population.” At the same time, psychiatric beds were converted to Covid beds, psych and detox units merged, reducing resources as needs increased. Beat cops no longer make arrests for shooting up in public, a directive that follows city prosecutors’ guidelines. “Have some self-respect,” reasons Ice, an addict on 8th avenue in Midtown. “The cops don’t want central booking filling up if the courts are just going to turn them out again.” The cost of the turmoil is self-evident. Ice’s girlfriend Ashley said 15 friends died of fentanyl overdose during the Covid pandemic, including a girl named Amber. “They didn’t even give her Narcan, they just threw a blanket over her.” At the same time, the ingenuity of the street flourished. One woman took eight vaccine shots, in exchange for the city’s $100 vaccine incentive. Shrugs, formerly a homeless street artist, said homelessness can be a matter of choice for some, albeit usually one among bad options. “Just because people have somewhere to live doesn’t mean it’s a home,” he said. “Some people like to camp out.” But, he concedes, once you are on the street “it is hard to get off”. Shrugs got his name for his ability to amuse New Yorkers with a comedic shrug – “Free Shrugs, Laughs a Dollar.” “It’s harder than it looks,” he said. “It’s all about timing.” At his shrug-laugh peak, he was making $100 a day. He began living on the street after his marriage failed and sold his art on Union Square, a business that collapsed when the city emptied. “Covid increased the desperation,” he said. He began recycling aluminum cans, establishing a depot on Forsythe Park on the Lower East Side, with a system of feeders. At one point, before the cops shut it down, he was moving 30,000 cans a day. “If you’ve got a good shtick you can make good money on the street,” he said. “But keeping it going is hard. People get jealous. Sometimes you lose everything and have to start over.” According to New York’s Coalition for the Homeless, homelessness in New York City has reached the highest levels since the Great Depression of the 1930s. But official figures gleaned from the municipal shelter system – 48,413 homeless people, including 15,057 homeless children in January – may only hint at the true figure. Shelters are notoriously unsafe and, according to Shrugs, often infiltrated by gangs. Living on the streets in Manhattan is considered by many safer than the outer boroughs that are similarly troubled. But there are always new hazards. New York has a problem with rodent infestation, making sleeping in the parks unattractive. “Giant rats,” said Sophie, “and they turn the sprinklers on.” Still, as New York authorities push for the city workers to return to offices, the issue remains live. Adams has ordered all people off the trains at the end of selected lines and wants police to enforce rules prohibiting stretching out on seats or sleeping on platforms. “No more just doing whatever you want. No, those days are over. Swipe your MetroCard. Ride the system. Get off at your destination,” Adams said last month. “The system was not made to be housing, it’s made to be transportation.” But it does not help the root problem. “You can push people around, tear down encampments, but that’s just shuffling folks around and not fixing anything,” said Housing Work’s Charles King. “Part of the problem with the shuffling is that it creates the perception that homeless people are the menace, and not the people most in need of our compassion and care.”",News/US news,Shelter gangs and a serial killer: Covid crime surge leaves New York’s unhoused more vulnerable,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/19/new-york-covid-homeless-vulnerable
3/19/2022,"Four members of the Wolverine Watchmen, a Michigan group that the government accuses of plotting to kidnap and kill Governor Gretchen Whitmer, are – depending on whom you believe – members of a dangerous paramilitary or a group of big-talking good ole boys full of hot air. Adam Fox, Brandon Caserta, Barry Croft Jr and Daniel Harris were charged in October 2020 with conspiring to abduct Whitmer from her northern Michigan vacation house. Their motive, say prosecutors in Grand Rapids, was anger over the Democrat’s Covid-19 restrictions and their plan has become a symbol of rising far-right violence and the threat it represents to US democracy. At the moment the FBI arrested the men, prosecutors argued in court, they had plans to acquire a bomb to blow up a bridge near Whitmer’s home to hinder police. Jurors, they have said, would see social media posts and hear secretly recorded conversations, highly inflammatory language and details of a plan to take down a “tyrant”. When they were arrested the case seemed a slam dunk. But as more evidence has unfolded and the trial has begun, a different narrative has emerged. Far from being a dedicated bunch of coup-plotters, their attorneys argue, the Wolverine Watchmen are hapless victims of FBI entrapment who had been induced by paid informants to commit crimes they would not otherwise have considered. The FBI, according to defense filings, deployed at least 12 informants, as well as several undercover agents. “There was no plan, there was no agreement and no kidnapping,” defense attorney Joshua Blanchard said last week. It is not an entirely outlandish claim. The defense’s argument of FBI entrapment draws on a long history. In the post 9/11 era, when internal US security agencies focused on the existence of Muslim extremist plots, several prosecutions, including of the Newburgh Four, hinged on informants actively promoting a plot before turning would-be perpetrators over to the government to be tried on conspiracy charges. Activists and civil rights experts have argued that the FBI has frequently overstepped boundaries, essentially egging on people to participate in plots and locking up people for crimes that they would never have committed had it not been for the intervention of law enforcement. Those counter-terrorist techniques, reapplied to the threat of white nationalist radicalization that Joe Biden has repeatedly said is the “most lethal threat” to the US, will play a part in how the Wolverine Watchmen trial unfolds. It has raised the question: were the Wolverines more dupes than dedicated terrorists? “Counter-terrorism tactics have evolved because there wasn’t a lot of international terrorism occurring on the US soil,” said Mike German, author of Disrupt, Discredit and Divide: How the FBI Damages Democracy. “But there’s still pressure to make cases and that’s caused the FBI to adopt this methodology of manufacturing terrorism plots.” German, who served 16 years as an FBI special agent and is now attached to the Brennan Center for Justice and NYU law school, says the tactics have migrated to far-right groups, though not necessarily with much success. The Hutaree militia case of 2010, in which nine members of a Michigan group infiltrated by the FBI were accused of plotting to kill a police officer, ended in acquittal. “When these tactics first started it was easy to get the public on the FBI’s side just by making allegations,” German said, recalling the case of the Liberty City Seven – a Muslim extremist plot to blow up Chicago’s Sears Tower that ended, after three trials, in five convictions. “The problem is, they’re manufacturing crimes and that’s not the job of a law enforcement agency – to make themselves look good by solving crimes they create – and there’s no legitimate government purpose in manufacturing a plot,” he said. Another issue, German says, is that there’s more white supremacist/far-right activity in the US than there ever was Muslim extremism. But the federal government doesn’t maintain a database on white extremist violence, lumping all extremism – white nationalist, environmentalist – in one category under the Hate Crimes Statistics Act (1990) and the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism, announced last year. And that, German points out, has left the government without accurate data on what has occurred and in a position of trying to predict and prevent what might occur. “The issue is starting with talk and getting to violence, but not vice versa,” he said. In the Wolverine Watchmen case, the four defendants are accused of taking deliberate steps toward violence, including secret messaging, gun drills and a night drive to northern Michigan to scout Whitmer’s vacation house. Two of the six men initially arrested, Ty Garbin and Kaleb Franks, have pleaded guilty and will appear as government witnesses. But defense attorneys claim that one of the men on trial, Barry Croft, was lured to militia meetings and gun training by “Big Dan”, an informant with a long criminal history who was paid $54,000 by the FBI. Big Dan’s handler was Jayson Chambers, an FBI agent who was looking to build a security consulting business that included “online undercover techniques” and had participated in investigations of Muslim “plots” involving inducements. Another informant, Stephen Robeson, has pleaded to various felonies. Another government witness, FBI agent Robert Trask, was fired after beating his wife after a swingers party. Another was accused of perjury. Still, anti-government extremism in the upper midwest comes with a track record that includes Terry Nichols, a participant in the 1995 Oklahoma city bombing, who was from Michigan. Fourteen men from the state have been charged in connection with the January 6 insurrection. In 2020, hundreds of protesters, some armed, some driving Humvees, attempted to enter the floor of the legislative chamber of Michigan’s state capitol as lawmakers debated Whitmer’s request to extend emergency Covid powers. Some compared Whitmer to Hitler. “I’m not surprised this is coming out of Michigan because of its history and because Governor Whitmer has drawn a lot of negative attention for her lockdown procedures,” said Amy Cooter, a sociologist at Vanderbilt University and author of Problems Predicting Extremist Violence. Cooter suggests the alleged plot against Whitmer was not merely about Covid restrictions but also because she is a woman and a Democrat. In Cooter’s experience groups that indulge in extremist talk rarely translate that into action. “The problem is there’s always potential for it to evolve into something more,” Cooter adds. “So when a specific person is targeted I think we have to take it seriously.” Nils Kessler, the assistant US attorney prosecuting the current case, has drawn explicit parallels between the plan and the January 6 attack. “As the Capitol riots demonstrated, an inchoate conspiracy can turn into a grave substantive offense on short notice,” he wrote in a court filing. Whatever the jury’s findings in the Wolverine case, Cooter predicts, groups on the right are “going to assume they were set up and [it] could galvanize some to further action”. JoEllen Vinyard, a professor of history at Eastern Michigan University who notes that today’s white nationalists have antecedents in racist groups like the KKK, says groups like the Wolverine Watchmen “see themselves as standing for democracy and in many cases saving the country from its leaders”. Michigan, she said, gets a lot of attention because groups there appear to be periodically better organized, depending on their leadership. “It’s hard to know the role of the FBI in this but these particular guys don’t seem to be the type that could exert much leadership,” she said. She added: “There’s a lot of unrest in this country that we haven’t always recognized, and people have different reasons at different times. They were encouraged, of course, by Donald Trump. He didn’t create it, but he gave these people a sense that they were right and justified in their actions.”",News/US news,Michigan governor kidnap case: hardened terrorists or FBI dupes?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/19/michigan-governor-kidnap-case-terrorists-fbi-dupes-gretchen-whitmer
