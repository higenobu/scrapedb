3/21/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Even investors with a lot at stake tend to agree: The stock market shouldn’t be a president’s top priority, especially when issues like war, blistering inflation and a pandemic are in play. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Says Some Opposition Parties Suspended Ukraine Update: Biden to Hold Call With European, U.K. Leaders Putin Set a Trap for Ukraine and Walked Right Into It Where Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings Time Russia Uses Hypersonic Weapons as War Enters Bloodier Phase Still, for practical purposes, there’s no getting around the disparity between the styles of Joe Biden and Donald Trump when it comes to the intersection of markets and politics. On Twitter, the favored forum for politicians to boast about accomplishments, Trump posted about stocks dozens of times, treating a rising Dow as an alternative approval rating of his administration. Biden has yet to tweet about the market at all, despite a string of records in his first year in office. Or consider State of the Union addresses. Trump touted a 70% rally during his term. Biden’s only mention of equities was to point out that sanctions stemming from the invasion of Ukraine knocked 40% off the value of Russian stocks and caused that market to close. “I’m not getting the impression that they’re making decisions with the equity market at the forefront of their thinking,” Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said in an interview. “They’re just looking and making the decisions they think they need to make in terms of domestic policy and foreign policy -- and that is what they’re supposed to do.” At the same time, presidential silence on stocks is part of a shifting landscape for investors, one where they are left to fend for themselves amid a panoply of global threats that stretch well beyond the boundaries of Wall Street. With Biden’s blessing, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has stiffened his resolve against inflation, striking fear into markets everywhere. Tightening sanctions on Russia threaten to whip up price pressures even more. Even Biden himself has made note of the difference in approaches. Before equities fell into a correction this year, he pointed out the strength of the market -- but it was almost as an aside. “By the way, the stock market -- the last guy’s measure of everything -- it’s about 20% higher than it was when my predecessor was there,” he said. “It has hit record after record after record on my watch while making things more equitable for working-class people.” The otherwise lack of emphasis on market performance should not come as a shock to investors, considering that Biden’s platform included boosting corporate taxes and other agenda items that were obviously not aimed at juicing stocks in the short term. What is surprising is how much the stakes have grown, especially as investors also find themselves without the support of accommodating central-bank policy. Biden’s contrasting style came into stark relief last month as Russia prepared for, and then launched, its attack on Ukraine, prompting an aggressive and unprecedented response in the form of financial sanctions from the administration and many U.S. allies. As Biden told Congress earlier this month: “A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.” Those costs have included an economically dangerous surge in oil prices and some bone-chilling volatility in the stock market. Now, with Ukraine’s surprising strength in defending its government prompting speculation that Vladimir Putin will seek a peace deal, equities and oil have stabilized for the moment. Yet the shakeup provided investors with some valuable information for the remainder of this presidency. The way Biden views wins and losses in his presidency clearly prioritizes issues he sees as more important -- the lives and well-being of Americans and the defense of allied democracies -- above the performance of financial markets. “Our measure of success is really how real working families are doing,” White House spokeswoman Emilie Simons said Friday. “And we’ve seen a great deal of progress made on that front.” The two presidents also differ on how to handle other important financial issues. Trump took to Twitter to pressure OPEC to boost production when energy prices started getting high, and he repeatedly criticized the Federal Reserve as it raised interest rates seven times during his term. Biden, on the other hand, has chosen more quiet, private diplomacy to urge a boost in oil production to make up for shunned Russia’s crude. He’s also embraced the need for higher interest rates, urging Congress to confirm his nominees to the Federal Reserve because the central bank “plays a critical role in fighting inflation.” “There’s so many other things going on right now that you could argue are much more important to civilization than some of the obstacles that Trump faced,” said Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Zephyr. “And he’s focused more on inflation -- that should be probably his biggest concern, rather than the market.” Another factor to consider going forward is that the shot clock on much of Biden’s agenda could be running out with the approach of the midterm elections in November, which historically tend to go against the political party of the sitting president. That’s a risk to the Democrats’ current slim -- and sometimes nonexistent -- control of Congress. Many market participants have priced in a loss of the party’s legislative majority, according to Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen. “Starting with that assumption, which was the case before the invasion, then maybe that means they’re willing to tolerate a little bit more pain and maybe elicit some voter dissatisfaction if they think this is genuinely the right thing to do,” Nick said in an interview. Nonetheless, many of Biden’s top priorities -- repairing the nation’s crumbling infrastructure, alleviating wealth inequality, mitigating global climate change and avoiding a direct conflict with Russia -- in the long run could arguably end up being beneficial to the economy and the American people, and therefore ultimately help the stock market, even if they ruffle feathers for a bit. “You have to keep the bigger picture in mind,” said Scott Bauer, chief executive officer of Prosper Trading Academy in Chicago. “I do not believe they’re concerned about the market going down 10% or 15%. If that happens, it happens, as long as in the long-run, whatever policies they are trying to institute are benefiting Americans.” Meanwhile, in the near term, RBC’s Calvasina says there’s a point at which the market could start to reflect fears about the economy or other factors. And the administration won’t ignore those signs, if and when they arrive. But that’s not the case at the moment. “You can’t sit here and say, ‘The market falls X percent, and then they’ll start to care,’” she said. “It really is a question of what drives the market to any kind of low, what’s the conversation going on in the world or domestically that’s driving the market to a certain level.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Broke Oligarch Says Sanctioned Billionaires Have No Sway Over Putin A Once Radical Idea to Close the Wealth Gap Is Actually Happening For Sale: Trudeau’s Oil Pipeline.

3/21/2022,"Have the markets turned the corner? Maybe not – but maybe so, at least for the short term. Despite rising inflation in the States, and Russia’s continuing war against Ukraine, high prices for oil, and disruptions in the global commodity markets, Wall Street just finished its best week since November of 2020. Between March 14 and March 18, the S&P 500 rose ~6%, while the NASDAQ was up ~9%. Investors were clearly in a buying mood, and the indexes reflected it. However, some Wall Street pros are understandably concerned that the market is still vulnerable. In this environment, investors are going to gravitate toward stocks that have proven records of strong share price appreciation. While we all know that past performance won’t guarantee future results, the best place to start looking for tomorrow’s high-growth stocks is among yesterday’s winners. Using TipRanks’ database, we’ve found three ‘monster growth’ names that saw hefty gains over the past 12 months. Each name is well-loved by Wall Street analysts, and has received enough bullish calls to score a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Golar LNG Limited (GLNG) We’ll start in the energy industry, where Golar LNG has exploited some economic quirks of the natural gas industry to become a leader in the liquified natural gas sector. The company specializes in the building and operation of floating natural gas liquefaction facilities, a niche that makes it possible to exploit previously non-economic gas reserves. Natural gas must be liquefied for safe long-distance transport, and Golar brings the liquefaction facilities to the gas fields – and can move those facilities when necessary. Golar boasts that its floating gas liquefaction fleet can operation at a lower cost than land-based facilities. High energy prices, and particularly rising prices for natural gas on the global market, has been good for Golar. The company has seen its share price rise 70% so far this year. A quick look at the company’s earnings will show the extent of the growth, and the potential. In 4Q21, Golar showed $93.5 million in EBITDA, up from $78 million in the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, the gain was higher; Q3’s result had been $74.5 million. BTIG analyst Gregory Lewis sees Golar in a strong position to gain additional business, writing: “We believe we are on the cusp of a multi-year run in LNG project FIDs (Final Investment Decision) as we expect natural gas to serve as a bridge fuel as the world shifts to renewable energy over the next few decades. And more importantly… Golar has a much improved capital structure (~$500M in current liquidity to go after its next flexible Floating LNG (FLNG) project which includes ~$250M in cash), an existing base of LNG assets which could be FLNG conversion projects, and FLNG solutions, which we think positions the company to win multiple FLNG projects over the next two years.” These comments support Lewis’s Buy rating, while his $30 price target on GLNG stock implies ~43% upside for the coming year. (To watch Lewis’ track record, click here) Overall, Golar’s Strong Buy analyst consensus rating is based on 8 recent stock reviews, that include 6 to Buy and 2 to Hold. The shares are priced at $21.02, and their $22.81 average price target indicates an 8.5% upside from that level. (See GLNG stock analysis on TipRanks) Matador Resources Company (MTDR) Sticking with the energy sector, we’ll turn our view to Matador Resources. This company engages in hydrocarbon exploration, development, and extraction, focusing on unconventional plays in the North American oil and natural gas industries. Matador has is primary operations in the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays the Texas-New Mexico Delaware Basin, with additional assets in Northwest Louisiana. Matador’s operations are generating cash as well as hydrocarbons. The company reported $334.5 million in cash from operations for 4Q21, up 15% from Q3, and an even stronger 112% year-over-year. This total included $119.3 million in adjusted free cash flow, nearly double the year-ago quarter’s $60.7 million. The steady growth in cash flow prompted Matador to increase its quarterly dividend this past fall, and to maintain the higher payment this month. The last dividend, paid out on March 14, was for 5 cents per common share. This annualizes to 20 cents, and gives a modest yield 0f 0.3%. The key point here is not the yield, but the combination of management’s statement of intent to increase the returns to shareholders along with the company’s strong cash flow generation. It’s important to note here that MTDR shares have gained 118% in the past 12 months. Neil Dingmann, 5-star analyst from Truist, writes of Matador: “We believe Matador has done a notable job of creating value in its ten year existence... By our estimates, the company continues to be set up for solid upcoming production/cash flow/stock price growth despite the strong share performance already seen in the past several months. We have high confidence of continued strong well performance in the ~70 wells to be turned to sales this year given the continued operational efficiencies/outperformance previously demonstrated.” Dingmann’s bullish stance comes with a Buy rating on the stock, while his $68 price target suggests Matador has room for ~29% upside growth by the end of this year. (To watch Dingmann’s track record, click here) There are seven recent reviews of Matador shares on record and they all agree that this is one to buy, making the Strong Buy consensus unanimous. The stock is selling for $52.81 and its $62 average price target implies ~17% one-year upside. (See MTDR stock analysis on TipRanks) Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITCI) Let’s shift gears now, and turn to the biopharmaceutical industry. Intra-Cellular Therapies is a clinical- and commercial-stage research company developing new treatments for mental health disorders in adults. This is a field with, in the jargon, ‘high unmet medical needs.’ Mental health diseases place a heavy burden on both patients and caregivers, and treatments currently available suffer from both poor success rates, high con-compliance rates with treatment, dangerous or undesirable side effects – or all of that combined. This gives Intra-Cellular an opening, if it can get a more effective drug to market. The company is on the cusp of that. In December of last year, the FDA approved ITCI’s leading product, lumateperone (branded as Caplyta) for the treatment of bi-polar depression in adults. This was an important label extension for Caplyta, which has already been approved in December of 2019 as a treatment for adult schizophrenia. Having a drug on the market is the Holy Grail for biopharma companies, and Intra-Cellular has seen a steady – and steadily increasing – revenue stream from Caplyta since its initial approval. In the last quarter reported, 4Q21, Intra-Cellular showed $25.7 million in top-line revenues. This was a 106% jump from the year-ago quarter, and marks the 7th straight quarter of revenue gains since Caplyta went on the market. Shares in ITCI reflect this revenue growth – the stock is up 70% since this time last year. The company is following up on its current success with lumateperone, and has additional clinical trials underway. The drug is being evaluated in a pair of Phase 3 double-blind placebo controlled studies as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. In addition, Intra-Cellular has three other drug candidates in earlier-stage clinical trials, for conditions ranging from Alzheimer’s and dementia to Parkinson’s and opioid abuse. Covering ITCI for Jefferies, analyst Andrew Tsai writes: “In 2022, we think ITCI stock could break all-time highs despite a challenging tape, as Caplyta scripts are accelerating earlier (and perhaps even faster) than Street expectations… For SCZ/BPD, we can derive a valuation of $6-8B + (or $65-85/sh) by applying a 3-4x multiple to our above-cons $2B peak sales estimate, though this thinking is perhaps conservative and excludes the Phase II/III pipeline (which deserves credit). Bottom line, a healthy balance sheet (we est Q1 cash of $750M +), a strong narrative (clean story), and meaningful upside potential (SCZ/BPD plus pipeline optionality) drive scarcity value, leading us to think ITCI stock should continue outperforming this year.” In line with this upbeat outlook, Tsai rates the stock a Buy, and his $90 price target implies an upside of 47% this year. (To watch Tsai’s track record, click here) Tsai is hardly the only bull on this stock; ITCI has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating supported by 9 analyst reviews. The average price target of $68.67 gives a 12% upside potential from the current share price of $61.05.
