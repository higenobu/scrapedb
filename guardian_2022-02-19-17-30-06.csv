2/19/2022,"Katie Tannenbaum was the only athlete heading to the Winter Olympics this year from the US Virgin Islands, and the first they had sent since 2014. She had been fighting to reach the Winter Olympics for some time. In 2018, despite having reached the qualifying standard, the US Virgin Islands were not given a place in the Pyeongchang skeleton competition. An appeal to the court of arbitration for sport failed. Having finally secured a place for the 2022 Games, once she was in Beijing, 36-year-old Tannenbaum tested positive for Covid and had to go into isolation. Her dream of being flagbearer for the group of Caribbean islands with a population of around 87,000 was over. With their only athlete absent, and their opening ceremony uniforms failing to arrive on time, the US Virgin Islands National Olympic Committee decided they would not attend the opening ceremony at all.  “I had remained tough through the news that I had Covid,” Tannenbaum told the Guardian via email, “but the thought of the Virgin Islands having no representation at the opening ceremonies made me emotional. I insisted that if I couldn’t be there someone had to be.” So the team improvised uniforms, and got a volunteer to carry the flag. And then just before they entered the arena, in a moment captured for social media, they video-called Tannenbaum so that she could be a part of it. “I was watching excitedly on TV from my isolation room when they called me just as they were about to walk out. My coach told me that this moment was for me, that we wouldn’t be at the Games without me, and thanked me for getting us here. I was in tears.” Tannenbaum, who started her sliding career in 2011, was freed from Covid isolation in time to compete – but barely had an opportunity to train on the unfamiliar track at the Yanqing National Sliding Centre before race day. “It all happened so fast,” she said. “I was in isolation for over a week, then the next thing I knew I was on the start line at the Olympic Games. While I was elated to have been able to race, it was also devastating to be competing in the biggest race of my career, with the world watching, less prepared than I had ever been. When race day came I had exactly two options … I could race unprepared or I could not race at all.” Tannenbaum decided to race, and was eliminated after the third heat, placed last, with a combined time a massive 12.69 seconds off the lead of the eventual gold medal winner Hannah Neise of Germany. “When I consider how close I came to not having any option, to not being able to even be a part of the race, it makes it easier to accept and to choose to be grateful,” she reflects. Despite her last place, Tannenbaum was all smiles at the end of the run, proudly displaying the US Virgin Islands flag. In any other Olympics there would be a happy ending, and freed from Covid isolation Tannenbaum would at least get her chance to wave the US Virgin Islands flag at the Closing Ceremony on the final day of Beijing. But this isn’t an ordinary Olympics. “Due to the Beijing Organizing Committee’s Covid-19 policies, athletes have to leave the Games within 48 hours after they finish competing, so I won’t be able to attend the closing ceremonies,” she explains. The US Virgin Islands haven’t had much luck in recent years at the Winter Olympics. They sent one competitor in 2014, but their only athlete at the 2006 Turin Games was due to compete for the sixth consecutive time in the luge and break her own record as the oldest woman to compete at a Winter Olympics. Instead the 52-year-old Anne Abernathy broke her wrist in a practice run and could not take part. Is this Tannenbaum’s one and only Olympic experience? Might we see her at Milano Cortina 2026? Would she want to emulate Abernathy? That remains to be seen. “I haven’t put a ton of thought into what my skeleton career will look like four years from now,” she says. “First I am going to enjoy some downtime with friends and family and then make that decision in due time.”",Sport/Sport,Emotional rollercoaster of US Virgin Islands’ only athlete at Beijing Games,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/19/us-virgin-islands-katie-tannenbaum-winter-olympics-beijing
2/19/2022,"The read-outs from this week’s Cobra meetings held to discuss the Russia-Ukraine crisis do not reveal what, if any, refreshments were available for participants, but it seems unlikely they were asked to bring their own booze.These are work meetings. There are serious things to discuss. Anyone given security clearance to attend will not find much party spirit in evidence.But what about the other “work-related events” that have taken place in Downing Street over the past two years and that are now, finally, being investigated by the police? Was this work or play, a bit of both, or some new hybrid and uncategorisable form of activity?Boris Johnson seems likely to defend his perilous position in myriad ways. That, as allies claim, he thought he was attending work events (raising the question of why he did not halt proceedings when he realised they weren’t). That his (brief, perhaps reluctant) attendance at some of these gatherings was all just part of the job. Of course he had to drop in on morale-boosting parties and leaving dos, to say hello and thank his colleagues. Why, he didn’t even realise these were parties. Such was his commitment to the task of being prime minister that he failed to register that alcohol was being drunk, games were being played and that all of this ran counter to the restrictions he kept announcing in media briefings from his prime ministerial lectern.All work and no play makes Boris Johnson a dull boy. And we should acknowledge that any useful definition of work must allow for the variety of forms that work can take.In the past we might simply have described work as “the completing of tasks”. Work is about getting stuff done. In this simple framing, you are either working or you are not. Productivity has to do with output, and quantifying what you have done. In the context of manufacturing and parts of the service sector, you aim to hit targets and deliver goods and services on time and preferably in full.But clearly the nature of quite a lot of work has changed. The management writer Peter Drucker first started talking about “knowledge workers” 60 years ago. What does knowledge work look like? It might involve creative people chewing their pencils and staring out of the window. It might even mean going to the pub. All this could be part of work and lead to the successful completion of tasks.This may partly explain why measuring productivity accurately can be difficult. Is work going on or not? And in an increasingly digital economy, what constitutes meaningful output? When does work stop, if it ever does? The push for a “right to disconnect” and moves to introduce a four-day week are both responses to the risk of non-stop permawork.Work can carry on in unexpected ways. When lawyers and other professionals charge you for their services, they may talk in term of “billable hours”. This refers to the time during which they were working for you. And if your star legal adviser was thinking hard about your case and making a breakthrough while lying in the bath, then that was a billable bath. It was work.Does this mean that the prime minister is in the clear, and that everything he did at the various parties the police want to investigate in fact constituted work? Not so fast.For one thing, several of these gatherings seem to have been entirely social in nature. This was downtime. It was not work. Indeed, Johnson has already admitted that at least one of the gatherings should not have taken place at all.And then we have to ask: what sort of work does Johnson get up to as prime minister? There are the meetings we don’t see – although some witnesses suggest getting him to focus can be difficult. There are a lot of photo-opportunities in hi-vis jackets, a lot of knockabout speeches that prove more or less successful, and there is quite a lot of phrase-making for pooled news clips. It is quite a performance. He seems to be enjoying himself at least some of the time.But as the American writer and mystic Joseph Campbell said: “Work begins when you don’t like what you’re doing.” Is our prime minister really working? It doesn’t always look like it.For any journalist, this is pot calling the kettle black territory. And perhaps it lies behind the irritation (and worse) that Johnson provokes in his critics. He seems to be getting away with the sort of bad behaviour some journalists might also want to get away with, on expenses, and with a country house to relax in at the weekends. He is world king for now, and the fact that he enjoys it delights his remaining fans and is hard for his enemies to bear.Now the Metropolitan police have some work to do. Sue Gray will hand in a complete report in due course. When their work is done, Johnson’s time at No 10 may be done, too.His time in office will not exactly have been a non-stop party. But there has still been too much partying going on by far. “Follow your bliss,” the mystic Campbell also urged. Follow your bliss … but don’t take the piss.

2/19/2022,"When Manchester United lost 4-1 at Watford in November, a defeat that cost Ole Gunnar Solskjær his job, things were that bad I thought it could only get better for the club. Since then not much has changed at Old Trafford. The squad available to Ralf Rangnick should be finishing in the top four of the Premier League. They are fourth but could relinquish that position to teams who have games in hand. If they fail to qualify for the Champions League there will be a lot of blame to go round, not just for those in the dugout or on the pitch, but in the boardroom, too.  Manchester City are not only above United in the table but have also overtaken them off the pitch. City have eclipsed United in terms of revenue accrued, making almost £75m more than their arch-rivals in the 2020-21 season. I am studying business, and when that side of things is not going perfectly, it does filter down on to the pitch. United have made some bad business decisions; a number of managers have come and gone since Sir Alex Ferguson left nine years ago, none of whom have come close to replicating that level of success, and many signings have failed to make an impact. There were no signings in January to improve a squad with flaws in defence and midfield. United have an interim manager, so entrusting Rangnick with a budget to invest in players his replacement might not want could be seen as a risk not worth taking. There are obvious issues, such as in central midfield where United are very weak, but they will not be dealt with until the end of the season. It is difficult to make an impact on the squad as an interim. The defensive structure is better and they are pressing slightly differently, but nothing has made me sit up and take notice. Rangnick has managed Cristiano Ronaldo differently to the way Solskjær did, leaving him out when he sees fit and substituting him when required. Ronaldo may not appreciate it but he is 37 and it does not matter how fit he is, he cannot be at his best throughout a long season if he is playing 90 minutes twice a week from August to May. United need him to be thriving. He has 15 goals in 27 appearances, seven more than the club’s second-highest scorer. Without Ronaldo, United would be further down the table and out of the Champions League. As he showed against Brighton he can score an incredible goal out of the blue. Ronaldo might not be happy he is not playing every minute but Rangnick may be doing both Ronaldo and the team a huge favour. Leaks are seemingly coming out of the dressing room about the coaching staff and training. If the stories are accurate, you have to wonder who is leaking them and what they have to gain. It is not a good look. Some players will think they can get away with not adapting to Rangnick’s methods because he will not be there too long and they can wait for the next manager. I remember hearing United players of the Ferguson era saying that what happened in the dressing room stayed there. They would go away with England and not discuss things happening at Old Trafford to make sure nothing got further than those who needed to know, not even international teammates. Secrecy was sacred under Ferguson during their most successful spell as a club and he would not have stood for this. When things are being leaked, it does not bode well. The aura United had during the Ferguson era is long gone. Teams would arrive at Old Trafford and feel in the warm-up they were 1-0 down. Now they feel they can win and there is no sense of fear. United have won seven of 13 home league games this season, which is not good enough for a team aiming to finish in the top four. It gives incentive to opponents. Even though United are not the scalp they used to be, winning at Old Trafford is huge for an opposition player. The team are different but the kits and stadium are the same, so it will be a euphoric experience to take points off United. Rangnick has lost only one league match but has drawn four of those 11 games and he has been knocked out of the FA Cup by the Championship side Middlesbrough at home. In many of those fixtures United have taken the lead but failed to build on it. In times gone by, United would go on to hit three or four to be out of sight long before the final whistle. The reason they are not doing that is the defence and midfield are fragile. Players are putting in the effort for the manager but they are not going to throw caution to the wind – they are being protective of their lead. Missing out on the Champions League would be a huge failure for a club with United’s stature and a good enough playing squad. They need to be at Europe’s top table to give their new manager the best chance to take the club back to where fans want – but there is plenty to do if United are to compete with Manchester City and Liverpool again.",Sport/Football,Leaks and lost leads are haunting Manchester United under Rangnick | Karen Carney,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/19/leaks-and-lost-leads-are-haunting-manchester-united-under-rangnick
2/19/2022,"Before Pankaj Mishra and Kamila Shamsie settle down to earnest conversation, they spar about Mishra’s recent renunciation of cricket, both as a player and as a spectator; Shamsie, a die-hard fan who has interviewed some of the sport’s greatest players, is mock-horrified to hear that Mishra, 53, now prefers tennis. Ten minutes on court, he contends, feels more rewarding than a whole day at the crease. “This is the real migration that has happened in Pankaj’s life!” laughs Shamsie. “It’s dramatic – he’s exiled himself.” Sporting differences aside, the pair are united by a deep commitment to the power of fiction, a subject they interrogate during a wide-ranging conversation on a cold day in London. Shamsie, 48, is the author of seven novels, including Burnt Shadows and Home Fire, a contemporary retelling of the myth of Antigone that won the Women’s prize for fiction in 2018. Her new novel Best of Friends will be published in September.  Mishra’s second novel, Run and Hide, is published this week, 20 years after his debut, The Romantics; in between, he has written several highly acclaimed works of nonfiction, including Temptations of the West, Age of Anger and Bland Fanatics, as well as numerous essays and pieces of long-form journalism. Run and Hide centres on a group of friends who meet at the Indian Institute of Technology and come to occupy a dominant position in global technology and finance. KS: I’m interested in your return to fiction. Having read you through the years, there’s so much in your novel that you’ve been writing about in nonfiction. I wonder whether it’s a question of fiction doing something that nonfiction couldn’t, or was it just that you’ve been waiting for a long time to write a novel and the moment seemed right? PM: In a way, I turned to nonfiction because after 9/11, there was a demand for accounts of Pakistan or Afghanistan, and I suddenly found myself meeting that demand. So it was partly a professional decision and partly drift – this is how you end up in most places, you just arrive there, you’re not quite sure how, and then two decades go by. I’ve done a lot of nonfiction, I’ve done a lot of books. And yet, I’m sort of haunted by the feeling that this work that I’m doing is just not good enough, in the sense that it’s not really capturing what is going on in the moral and emotional lives of these people that I’m talking about. Returning to fiction was just so liberating. I was suddenly able to set aside all the formulas of magazine writing, periodical writing, op-ed commentary, and find myself in this realm where I can do anything. I realised this is how life is; people have ideas, but they also have deep inner doubts about those ideas, and their behaviour never quite conforms to how they project themselves to other people. KS: I wonder whether, around the time you started writing the novel, the need for a form which allows those contradictions became more pertinent? PM: Definitely. There are several events, obviously, that went into this particular decision, but one of them was certainly this question of identity. When you spend a lot of time in the west and you write in a particular way, pushing back against all kinds of crude prejudices and ideas about the part of the world that I come from, you’re given a certain kind of identity. It’s projected upon you that you are speaking up for people who have been misrepresented. You’re called a polemicist; that’s a word that’s often trailed me. And you realise that actually, your real engagement is what is happening in the part of the world that you spend most of your life in, which for me is India, the massive political changes there. And seven years ago, a person accused of mass murder [Narendra Modi] became prime minister. That was a traumatic event for many of us. And it’s difficult to process. How did a country that was one of the few democracies in Asia suddenly make this catastrophic decision? That was a question I felt I could not answer in my nonfiction. Then, of course, suddenly you saw that situation everywhere: in Pakistan, a populist coming to power, Brexit here, Trump, so then it became a kind of global situation affecting all our lives. You obviously felt the same in some ways? KS: Yes. And fiction is a very useful place if you have questions rather than answers. PM: That’s well put. KS: You don’t have to have a point of view or an argument you want to build up, you can have the mess of finding yourself holding contradictory thoughts or having sympathies for people in opposing places or finding someone has made a choice you really disagree with, but there’s something you understand about how that choice got made. PM: I think in both our cases, we’re also trying to hold a conversation between these two different worlds we inhabit. One is the place that we’ve grown up in. And the other is where we now live, where we have different identities, or we’re seen differently. And yet, those experiences often seem to be disconnected. One of the reasons I was motivated to write this book is that in the last four or five years, alongside the explosion of Trumpism and Boris Johnsonism, we’ve also had this other discourse, a lot of it extremely welcome, which is focused on the victims of history and historical injustices. But I think this discourse ought to be complicated by the issue of class, which is important in both our writings. Here you are in the UK and being upheld as a representative of darker-skinned peoples or a representative of Asian literature and religion, any number of things. But the fact is that we belong to privileged classes and caste groups. And that is not evident to people here. But we know that we are products of particular systems of injustices back home. KS: I think what can happen here is there’s a curious flattening when people talk about people who are not white, or are minorities, as though these class differences don’t exist, and as though some of us don’t step into London with huge privilege, which makes it possible to move through the city in ways that other people can’t. PM: In a way all these problems of representation, which is what essentially we’re talking about … fiction doesn’t exactly give direct answers to these problems, but it complicates them further. I mean, just to give you an example: I was looking at Vanity Fair, and there’s this famous Indian film star called Priyanka Chopra on the cover. And that struck me as actually a rather chilling example of how representation has worked here, which is that we’re supposed to celebrate the fact that a south Asian, a dark-skinned woman, has appeared on the cover of a magazine that has mostly featured either white people or people born in this part of the world. But what that fact hides is that this person who’s on the cover of Vanity Fair and has tweeted in support of Black Lives Matter is also a friend and supporter of Mr Modi, that she has posed for selfies with him, and that her position within the politics and society and culture of India is a deeply contested one. So it’s a question of breaking down these very simplistic ideas about race, class and gender people have in their heads. And fiction can do that. KS: One of the fascinating things about taking Antigone as a source text for Home Fire was looking at ways in which the play had been interpreted. And you realise in the 20th century, a lot of these rewrites were being written in situations of dictatorship and particularly in the face of civil disobedience to dictatorship. And then you get the 21st century: my Antigone is in Britain today, and Anne Carson when she wrote Antigonick [in 2012] very much referred to Guantánamo and George Bush. This figure of resistance to the unjust ruler is actually beginning to have more of a place in these western liberal democracies. And it was quite striking to me that it’s no longer writing against the junta in Argentina or apartheid in South Africa. Now it is Britain and America that are seen as the countries where there are laws that are inhuman. PM: Culture has been the enabling factor in much toxic populism around the world. The drumbeat of stories about Muslims by the rightwing media in this country has created a really toxic atmosphere, in which the apotheosis of people like Johnson becomes possible. Politics really cannot be disconnected from literary cultures, intellectual cultures, or popular cultures. KS: I became a UK citizen in 2013, and moved here a few years prior to that. I was having this conversation with a friend a couple of weeks ago, who said: “When you became a citizen here, you couldn’t have predicted what a bleak country this would become.” And I thought, no one who was Muslim in this country in the early 21st century would make a statement like that. I remember 9/11, 7/7, the grotesqueness and the horror of those times. And I thought: actually, it felt much worse then; back then I would enter a room and be told things like, but you’re not really Muslim, and asked in this very thoughtful, sad way: “What is it about Islam?” It was the kind of Islamophobia that was an assault, really. I’m not saying it’s gone away, but the temperature has lowered. It felt horrific to be in Britain as a Muslim back then. It’s only now that I realise the extent to which, if you weren’t Muslim, or living very close to someone who was, you probably really weren’t aware of just how suffocating and depressing it was. And there’s a clear line from the destruction of civil liberties that became acceptable then to the removal of citizenship that’s happening now. PM: The culture war globally is the reflex of people who feel besieged right now, who feel deeply challenged. Essentially, it’s people who feel that their moral order or their intellectual order is fading, and that they need to resurrect somehow the certainties that made them so unchallengeable for so long. I see the same reflex at work among people in my upper-caste group in India, who have cuddled up to a demagogue in order to feel protected from what they see as a mob of woke leftists and liberals. KS: Do you remember that Martin Amis interview [in the Times in 2006]? PM: Yes, absolutely. KS: It was such a punch in the stomach to read him basically saying that if Muslims won’t get their house in order, then maybe we need to make them suffer enough to do it. So perhaps they should be banned from travelling. And then, a year later, Amis says: “Oh, that was a thought experiment and I’ve decided, no, that’s probably not the way to go.” People now who complain about cancel culture probably would think those are the good old days when a writer says things like that in print. PM: One way of looking at it is to concede that cancel culture, if you want to use this unfortunate phrase, has always been with us. People in power have always stifled the free expression of things that they don’t want to hear. Without being melodramatic, from the beginning of my writing career in the west, I’ve confronted one form of cancellation or another. When Afghanistan was being invaded in 2001, I had such a hard time persuading my editors in the UK and the US to publish even something saying that war is a really, really bad idea, or something basic like, maybe the Taliban do have a stake in the country? It was such an atmosphere at that point, such a macho rush to war and to vengeful violence, it was very difficult to go against the consensus. KS: You’ve talked a lot about the things that you can do in fiction, but here’s my question to you. Isn’t it more fun than writing nonfiction? PM: Oh, my God. Oh, absolutely. No question. It’s exhilarating, it really is. I mean, you know, going back to your desk every morning, and starting with a scene that you have to describe, or a physical description, all just such stimulating challenges, as opposed to writing yet another piece about Johnson the liar or Joe Biden’s failures. You cannot imagine how demoralising it is, you know, to do it week after week. Here you can escape, even if you’re talking about dark things, there are still moments of beauty you can recover.

2/19/2022,"Iwasn’t expecting to well up while watching a documentary about Kanye West. The embattled rapper has made some of the most thrilling, expansive albums in the genre and beyond, but around the time he aligned himself with Trump politically and the Kardashian set personally, the music took a turn for the turgid, while it seemed kinder to look away from the celebrity theatrics. Exhaustively scrutinising his tumultuous life and work over 20 years, the nearly five-hour Netflix project Jeen-yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy is more moving than you might think. Its directors, Coodie Simmons and Chike Ozah, have history with West, having directed his breakout videos for the singles Through the Wire and Jesus Walks, and the film benefits from their thick-and-thin perspective. Filming for Jeen-yuhs effectively started in 1998, with a plan to chronicle the then 21-year-old unknown’s rise through the circuit, from securing a record deal through to the recording of his gamechanging 2004 debut The College Dropout – his blazing creative process at the outset captured like lightning in a bottle. After a period of estrangement, they catch up with the vastly changed West in the present day, beset with mental health problems, a ruinously inflated celebrity ego and lingering grief over the death of his mother, Donda. It’s upsetting viewing, and all the more poignant for the flashes of mercurial brilliance that still glimmer through his erratic behaviour. Try as the documentary might to end on a note of hopeful closure, we sense West’s story has a few more acts to go.  As it is, Jeen-yuhs is an essential addition to the ranks of hip-hop cinema: would that most titans of the genre had been so thoroughly documented at all stages of their career. For devoted thoroughness, it can be filed alongside Michael Rapaport’s Beats, Rhymes and Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest (2011; Mubi/Amazon Prime), a lively, semi-scholarly portrait of the influential rap collective, though that’s a rather more plainly celebratory affair. Nas: Time is Illmatic (2014; Dogwoof on Demand) focuses particularly on the creation of a single classic album rather than a whole career, and is rich in the kind of musicological detail that larger portraits tend to leave out. Meanwhile, for a bigger picture of an entire scene’s origins, the 1983 classic Style Wars (Amazon) holds up well, immersing us in the graffiti-tagged New York City social unrest that shaped the form. Hip-hop biopics are a patchier genre, often too sanitised and streamlined to serve their subjects well. Dynamically cast and performed, the NWA story Straight Outta Compton (2015; Netflix) is one of the best, though its conventional, Oscar-chasing rags-to-riches structure still feels ill-suited to such iconoclasts. Still, they fare better than the Notorious BIG in the Madame Tussauds-esque Notorious (2009; Disney+), which is bigger on bling than grit. More interesting is the subgenre of reflective star portraits for hip-hop icons playing versions of themselves. Eminem fared very well in his textured, propulsive Detroit origin story 8 Mile (2002; Netflix), a stiff 50 Cent less so in his vainglorious, Jim Sheridan-directed effort Get Rich or Die Tryin’ (2005; also Netflix), though it’s fascinating as an exercise in 00s celebrity iconography. Sometimes, however, there’s more authenticity in pure fiction. Terrence Howard scored an Oscar nomination for his scorching breakout turn as a Memphis pimp trying to break into rap in Hustle & Flow (2005; Apple TV), and the film, with its unflattering sweat and dirt and custom-written beats, hits harder than most. It’s also where women tend to get a fairer shake. A Sundance phenomenon a few years ago, Geremy Jasper’s Patti Cake$ (2017; Amazon Prime) – about a white working-class Jersey girl with big rap dreams – is too perfect an underdog story to be true, while writer-director-star Radha Blank’s delightful The 40-Year-Old Version (2020; Netflix) might be the most joyful hip-hop film ever made, with its story of a hard-up playwright fighting ageism, racism and sexism, and turning to hip-hop to find her voice. It’s a far cry from Jeen-yuhs’ sobering study of Kanye West struggling with his. Kimi(Sky Cinema/Now TV)With his talk of retiring from film-making now a distant memory, Steven Soderbergh continues to bounce fizzily from one genre to the next. This tight, trim thriller is one of his most purely enjoyable recent efforts. Starring a terrific, cobalt-haired Zoë Kravitz as an agoraphobic tech worker convinced she has overheard a violent crime, it nods to vintage Hitchcock and The Conversation in its prowling sense of paranoia, but also feels firmly rooted in the present. House of Gucci(Universal)As Lady Gaga fans dry their tears over the star’s omission from the best actress Oscar race, the arrival of Ridley Scott’s luridly entertaining true crime soap on small-screen media feels just right: it was always a glossy miniseries at heart. If Scott’s steely direction feels less than fully invested in the story of the Gucci family’s bloody downfall, you can’t say the same for Gaga, Al Pacino and Jared Leto’s grand, gale-force performances. King Richard(Warner Bros)Will Smith’s all-in star turn as ultimate tennis dad Richard Williams – who pushed his daughters Venus and Serena to greatness – is so charismatic as to make you almost overlook how odd and uninquisitive it is to frame the Williams’s story as an inspirational Great Man biopic. When the sisters’ mother, Oracene (a superb Aunjanue Ellis), takes him to task for hogging all the credit, this otherwise very likable film doesn’t offer much of a corrective. Old Henry(Sky Cinema/Now TV)So often a characterful presence at the edges of American independent films, Tim Blake Nelson gets the tailored starring vehicle he deserves in this pleasingly traditional, dirt-under-the-fingernails western.

2/19/2022,"The owner of a Hewlett-Packard printer has vowed to never buy another thing from the company after a “firmware update” left his £150 printer unusable because he had bought cheaper ink cartridges from another manufacturer. Dom Smith, who works in IT in the Netherlands but is originally from the UK, was left incensed after the HP OfficeJet Pro 8020 printer he bought during lockdown was rendered useless by a recent software update.  He is just the latest person to complain about the problem that has dogged the owners of HP printers who have balked at the price of the company’s own-brand ink cartridges. For several years, HP has been using the firmware updates to prevent the use of “fake” ink cartridges that it claims infringe its copyright. The policy has put the firm on a collision course with buyers, and has led to a number of legal actions. In 2018, HP agreed to pay $1.5m (£1.1m) to customers in the US, and the company is facing another class action from people claiming a firmware update made their printers incompatible with other brands’ ink cartridges. Smith, who had paid more than £150 for his printer, said he was quoted a “crazy” price to buy a complete set of replacement HP ink cartridges, so had bought cheaper aftermarket ones that had worked fine until the update. “It left me unable to print anything. I’m so cross about it that I would rather scrap my perfectly good 8020, and nearly full ink cartridges, than be strong-armed by HP into buying their products,” he says. “I can’t believe that this is even legal. Surely, once I have paid for the printer it is mine to do with what I want. I would strongly urge others with HP printers to change the settings so that they no longer accept any firmware updates and stop this happening to them.” Max Freeman, a commercial director at the Crewe-based supplier Cartridgepeople.com, says most consumers are unaware that it is possible for a printer manufacturer to stop them from using third-party ink. He agrees with Smith that there is little to be gained by consumers from allowing the HP updates, assuming you have the technical skills to stop them from happening. “This has been a long-fought battle. However, I would urge users not to be put off from using third-party cartridges, and many will still work – provided they retain the original HP chip.” He says companies such as his are careful to use recycled or remanufactured cartridges that will “span” a firmware update. His firm offers a lifetime guarantee on its cartridges and promises a refund if a software update leaves a customer’s printer out of action. It encourages the recycling of original HP empties, as once remanufactured they will continue to work, post any firmware upgrades. A spokesperson for HP says: “HP includes dynamic security to protect the quality of our customer experience, protect HP’s intellectual property, as well as reduce illegal counterfeiting of HP cartridges and warranty fraud. “Refilled or remanufactured supplies that use an original HP chip will continue to function normally. Other cartridges, including those using cloned chips, or modified or non-HP circuitry, may not work today or in the future.” They said the company offers a range of options for customers, including HP Instant Ink, that can save UK customers up to 70%. However, this has not been enough to convince Smith. He says his printer had a sticker offering the 70% discount but the site would not allow him to register. He has since bought a new printer from another firm, and says he will not be buying another HP product.",Lifestyle/Money,How cheap ink cartridges can cost you dear,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/19/how-cheap-ink-cartridges-can-cost-you-dear
2/19/2022,"Experts have sounded the alarm over a growing trend for selling human breast milk online, warning that it can contain harmful bacteria, drugs and viruses including HIV. The concerns prompted eBay to remove listings from its platform, saying it had updated its automatic filters to stop breast milk being sold on the site in future.  Dr Sarah Steele, a public health researcher at the University of Cambridge said that while human breast milk had been sold for some time on online platforms, it had normally been listed with some information about the potential risks. But in recent weeks – after reports on social media of women earning as much as £10,000 from selling their milk to bodybuilders – she had noticed a marked rise in the number of adverts. “We need to remember it’s a body fluid. Recently, I have observed, and what certainly ramped up very rapidly in the last week, is the rise of listings on auction sites and online social marketplaces with buy-it-now prices, minimal information about the seller, and no referencing to any safety advice or information whatsoever,” she said, adding there also appears to be an increase in listings offering to post the milk rather than courier it. “What’s new is this idea of remote sale from a total stranger you will never meet and therefore aren’t screening or building trust with at all. You have no idea who or what is at the other end of the transaction. It’s very unsafe,” she said. “Most of all shipping via Royal Mail is not temperature controlled and that’s when bacteria multiply. This should be obvious to people – you don’t send your mate milk via Royal Mail when they run out. Online grocery sites have had to implement a host of food safety protocols.” One advert on eBay seen by the Guardian on Thursday that was apparently posted by a 36-year-old in the UK, charged £15 for 150ml of breast milk. “My baby was born on 10 January and I have an oversupply of excess human breast milk for sale,” the seller wrote. “Milk will be posted frozen in insulated packaging with a frozen gel pack.” After being alerted to the advert by the Guardian, an eBay spokesperson said: “The sale of human breast milk is prohibited on eBay. We have removed listings of this item and updated our automatic block filters to prevent it being listed in future.” There are a number of milk banks in the UK, which provide free human breast milk to babies who need it. However these typically carry out lifestyle checks on donors for factors such as smoking or drug use, and screening of donors to check for infections including HIV, Hepatitis B and syphilis. The breast milk itself is also screened and pasteurised for safety. Steele said one risk from unscreened milk is cytomegalovirus or CMV, often found in households with cats. While the virus is generally harmless it can cause serious health problems in unborn babies and infants and adults with weakened immune systems. “While people assume the buyers are parents of newborns, actually quite a few people looking for milk online are adults, some who are looking for an alternative therapy when they have cancer or other conditions because they believe it will either offer an immune boost, or be a source of nutrition that they tolerate more,” said Steele. “A lot of the promises people read about in online forums about the miracles of breast milk for adults don’t hold up to science, and the risks of buying this online outweigh any purported benefits,” she added. Steele added research has previously found that human breast milk from online sellers can be rich in gram-negative bacteria, potentially linked to poor hygiene practices, which can be harmful. Another risk, said Steele, is that human breast milk sold online may be diluted with cow’s milk or other fluid, while the storage bags used may mean the milk could contain other substances, such as the industrial chemical BPA.",News/Society,Growing sales of breast milk online amid warnings about risks ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/19/growing-sales-of-breast-milk-online-amid-warnings-about-risks
2/19/2022,"As Joe Biden lurched from crisis to crisis with plummeting approval ratings, the Republican party seemed largely content to bury its internal differences and enjoy the show. But not for long.  Earlier this month Alyssa Farah Griffin, once communications director for President Donald Trump, made clear that her loyalties have shifted to former vice-president Mike Pence and the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell. “Put me squarely in the Pence/ McConnell camp,” Farah Griffin wrote on Twitter. “Certain denunciations must be unequivocal.” This drew a sharp retort from Keith Kellogg, who served as Pence’s national security adviser. “As midterms draw close and 2024 looms large, choices will have to be made and lines will be drawn,” he tweeted. “For me – it is Trump.” The exchange was a microcosm of factional struggles once again boiling to the surface of the Republican party. Trump remains dominant but, with elections in 2022 and 2024 concentrating minds, fragments of the establishment wing are stirring and probing for signs of weakness. What is unclear, however, is how much these disparate forces have in common and whether they are willing to make sacrifices to unite. Republicans’ recent ceasefire between Trumpists and not-Trumpists ended when Pence, who served as Trump’s loyal deputy for four years, uttered four words that few imagined they would ever hear: “President Trump is wrong.” It was a reference to Trump’s false claim that his vice-president could have overturned the 2020 election. The comment was endorsed by Pence’s former chief of staff, Marc Short, who has also testified to the House of Representatives select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. Should Pence challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2024, he would have a ready-made entourage, including Short and Farah Griffin. McConnell has made clear that he approves of Pence’s actions on January 6 and refused to amplify Trump’s bogus claims of voter fraud, even as opinion polls suggest a huge majority of the Republican electorate wrongly believes that Biden did not legitimately win the 2020 election. The senator from Kentucky also recently condemned the Republican National Committee for censuring Representatives Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois for sitting on the January 6 committee, which is led by Democrats and has subpoenaed many in the former president’s inner circle. Such positions have earned Trump’s wrath. He declared: “Mitch McConnell does not speak for the Republican Party, and does not represent the views of the vast majority of its voters.” Like other Trump antagonists before him, McConnell, who turns 80 on Sunday, has even suffered the indignity of a Trump nickname – “Old Crow”. Senate Republicans have never entirely yielded to Trump. Seven voted to convict him at last year’s impeachment trial. Mitt Romney of Utah is a trenchant critic. Last month Mike Rounds of South Dakota rejected his false claim of widespread voter fraud, prompting Trump to lash out: “He is a weak and ineffective leader, and I hereby firmly pledge that he will never receive my endorsement again!” But House Republicans are more tightly in Trump’s grip. Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader, frequently breaks with McConnell in his expressions of fealty, in part because his caucus includes “Make America great again” extremists such as Madison Cawthorn, Matt Gaetz, Ronny Jackson, Jim Jordan and Marjorie Taylor Greene. Then there are Republican state governors who, typically more pragmatic, have shown greater willingness to speak out against Trump. They include Larry Hogan of Maryland, who said on Sunday he is “certainly going to take a look” at a presidential bid in 2024. But as the centrist leader of a Democratic-leaning state, Hogan has little affinity with hardline conservatives such as Pence or Cheney. Add in vociferous groups of disaffected alumni such as the Lincoln Project and the Republican Accountability Project and it is clear there are different constellations in the Never Trump firmament. What they are against is self-evident; what they are for is more ambiguous. Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank, said: “There’s not really a Never Trump movement. There is a collection of people who aren’t for Trump’s continued domination of the Republican party. They tend to be on various sides of what we would have recognised pre-Trump as establishment Republicans.” But, notably, even Trump’s Republican critics rarely denounce his policies on border security, crime, immigration, taxes, voting rights or issues such as abortion or how race is taught in schools. Pence, for example, tempers his rare dissent with paeans to the accomplishments of the Trump administration. Olsen, author of The Working Class Republican, added: “Centrist Republicans have to ask whether or not they want to be leaders of this Republican party or of the Republican party they wish they had. The centre of the Republican party today is broadly pro-Trump policies, but preferring to move beyond Trump personally.” “A lot of these people still have problems with Trump policies. Larry Hogan is definitely not somebody who is national material for the Republican party, which is why I don’t think he’s going to run. He would have his hat handed to him because he’s not a conservative of any stripe and the Republican party is still a conservative party of some stripe or another, whether it is a Trump personality aspect or pre-Trump movement conservatism or something in between.” The challenge for any future standard bearer may be to create a coalition that links these different blocs. Olsen argues that the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, a co-founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, has shown an ability to adapt to the new Trumpist Republican party and is widely seen as an heir apparent. But first the party must navigate the midterm elections in November. It is expected to regain the House and possibly the Senate but Trump’s obsession with the “big lie” of a stolen election could prove a dangerous liability among votes focused on the future. McConnell is reportedly manoeuvring to recruit Republican candidates who reject the baseless assault on American democracy, with limited success so far, but is working behind the scenes rather than offering the kind of full-throated repudiation of Trump that some would like. Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: “If you’re trying to achieve real change inside the party, if you’re trying to take the party back or you want to move off of Trumpism, you’ve got to make it very clear. Mitch McConnell no more wants Donald Trump to be the nominee of the party in 2024 than I do. Then come out and say that.” If McConnell, McCarthy and Republican governors held a joint press conference to declare that Trump lost, denounce his lies and set out their governing principles, “then it begins to move the needle inside the party”, Steele added. Such an act seems unlikely, to put it mildly. McConnell is not a figure of mass popular appeal and his powers as a kingmaker are limited. Trump, by contrast, retains a fervent fanbase in the Republican grassroots, as evidenced by the big crowds at his campaign rallies. Next week’s Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, is expected to be another show of strength, with speakers including Trump, DeSantis, Cawthorn, Gaetz, Jackson and Jordan. Tim Miller, writer-at-large for the Bulwark and former political director for Republican Voters Against Trump, said: “I think the problem is bottom up, not top down. The voters want Trump and crazy and so the politicians that are giving it to them are doing the best.” Even so, the midterms could give Trump a black eye. He has showered endorsements on dozens of candidates, some of them long shots who trail their establishment counterparts in the polls and in fundraising. Defeats for Trump’s champions in marquee races such as Georgia would revive the perennial question – asked every year since 2015 – of whether his command of the party is declining. Frank Luntz, a pollster and strategist, said: “It’s now over a year since January 6 and support for Trump has decreased a little but those who have stayed with him are even more passionate and that’s what is going to characterise the next 12 months.” An NBC News poll last month found that 56% of Republicans now define themselves more as supporters of the party than of Trump, compared with 36% who are first and foremost committed to the former president (this marked a reversal from October 2020 when 54% put Trump above party). But his favorability remains high among registered Republicans – just under 80% in an Economist-YouGov tracking poll – and he is the clear frontrunner for 2024. Michael D’Anonio, a political author and commentator, added: “He does still have a death grip on the party and I don’t see that fading. As much as people who I admire want that to happen, I don’t think it’s at hand just yet.”",News/US news,Anti-Trump Republicans agree on one thing – but that’s about all,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/19/republicans-split-fealty-donald-trump
2/19/2022,"There was a craze in my youth for green moisturisers and foundation, notionally designed not to treat the causes of skin redness, but to colour-correct the ensuing ruddiness. The craze died off – mostly, I imagine, because it made most people look poisoned. I hadn’t tried one in years until I tested positive for Omicron, which gave me just enough itchy redness to put new, rebooted camouflage creams to the test. L’Oréal Paris C’est Magique CC Cream (£10.99) is an effective option at a terrific price. It’s essentially a green moisturiser containing tiny spheres of colour-adaptive foundation that sort of pop as you blend the fluid into your face with fingers or brush. The green cancels redness, the foundation provides a healthier tint, and the whole thing works very well on moderate cases.  IT Cosmetics specialises in colour correction, and makes a good green-tinted day cream called Bye Bye Redness (£40). But I’d say the hero product in its lineup is the Your Skin But Better CC+ Cream SPF50 (£32.50), since I can think of nothing more instantly de-reddening, inclusive and indispensable to the many men and women who flush. This is a cream that camouflages all sorts of redness, including birthmarks and scars, offering full coverage while being easy to apply. It’s available in 14 shades, with no green – you just match your tone using the helpful gallery of real faces online. Buff on with a brush (or fingers) in place of foundation, then wear whatever you like on top. This keeps skin comfortable and moist (there’s a version for oily skins) and stays smoothly in place all day. Dr Jart+ Cicapair Tiger Grass Color Correcting Treatment (from £15) is the final step in the brand’s solid anti-redness skincare lineup. It’s a mostly cosmetic solution: a balm that, although it looks mint green in the pot, turns beige when a small amount is warmed between the fingertips. (This step is crucial, as I discovered after my first attempt, which made me look like a waxwork.) When warmed and blended – very easily – over any red areas, it works well in unifying tone on fair to olive skins, making a fast and visible difference and readily accepting other types of makeup on top. I can certainly see why this product has been so hugely popular on TikTok. My only guidance would be that you should not attempt to use this as your moisturiser, since you’ll end up absorbing too much – and it’s very easy to go full broad bean.",Lifestyle/Fashion,The best creams and correctors to camouflage ruddy skin | Sali Hughes,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/19/the-best-creams-and-correctors-to-camouflage-ruddy-skin
2/19/2022,"The primordial deep, it turns out, is a very chatty place. In a new study published in the journal Ichthyology & Herpetology, Cornell University researchers reveal that fish rely on acoustic communication far more than previously thought.  People have long known that fish make sounds; in his History of Animals, Aristotle describes the “noises and squeaks” fish produce, sometimes by grinding their own bones against each other in a mechanism called stridulation. Yet for decades, a lack of adequate underwater microphones and recording technology has kept scientists in the dark about just how many species of fish make noises, and whether those noises are the incidental rumblings of speechless creatures, or actually constitute communication. Now, researchers have learned that sounds are “a major mode of communication among fish, rather than just limited to a few oddballs”, says lead author Aaron Rice, a researcher at the K Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Not only is acoustic communication widespread among fish, but Rice and his team’s analysis of sound-producing physical characteristics (like certain swim bladder musculature) across species suggests that ancient sturgeons first started chatting aloud 155m years ago, right around the same time some tetrapods, like birds and mammals, began speaking up, too. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05-61553-gnl.fw.200505.jf.ch7DW.mp3 Moreover, the study found that acoustic communication among different fish species has independently evolved at least 33 different times, probably due to the diversity of their habitats. This pattern suggests to researchers that more soniferous fish species and families exist and are yet to be recorded, and highlights the important role that acoustic communication has played in the history of vertebrates. What are fish talking about? Mainly sex and food, it seems. “We see more elaborate sounds being produced in reproductive contexts,” says Rice. How these noises actually sound to humans varies widely; scientists use a variety of onomatopoeic descriptors like “boops”, “honks” and “hoots” to convey what they’re hearing. Some fish, like the three-spined toadfish, sound similar to croaking frogs, whereas others, like the midshipman fish, emit low, haunting, foghorn-like hums. Prior research on the noises produced by highly vocal codfish even found fish can have regional accents strong enough that others in their species may find them hard to understand. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05-61553-gnl.fw.200505.jf.ch7DW.mp3 Recognizing the extent to which fish communicate using sound allows researchers to better determine the effects of noise pollution on many different aquatic species. Researchers consider noise pollution to be as harmful as overfishing, water pollution and the climate crisis, negatively affecting marine mammals and at least 21 species of fish that rely on their hearing to thrive. Cornell’s study suggests the threat posed by noise pollution is even more severe. “If you have literally millions of individual fish that are relying on communication sounds for the success of their populations, perturbing their acoustic environment may have real consequences,” says Rice. Rice hopes that capturing and cataloging fish sounds online will allow the public an opportunity to better connect with the often inscrutable creatures. Hopping on to a computer and listening to the sounds of the ocean could be a way to get people interested in and concerned for the wellbeing of fish the way we are with more familiar and charismatic animals, like birds. Andrew Bass, a behavioral and evolutionary neuroscientist and co-author of the study, hopes the research will help humans better appreciate the complexity of other animal societies overall. “There’s a reason why all these other species exist and have been successful,” he says. “A big piece of that success is social communication … [Humans] have very sophisticated language, but I think what our study shows is that the whole history of social communication using sound is very old. And that means we can learn a lot from other animals about ourselves.”",News/Science,"Hums, honks and boops?

2/19/2022,"Separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine have ordered a full military mobilisation, further escalating tensions in the region after Washington said Moscow would invade within days, and Ukraine’s president headed to Europe to drum up support. As the Kremlin said that Vladimir Putin will oversee major military drills along Ukraine’s borders on Saturday, the head of the pro-Russian separatist government in the Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, released a statement announcing a war footing and urging reservists to show up at military enlistment offices.  Shortly after the announcement on Saturday morning, a second separatist leader, Leonid Pasechnik of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR), signed a decree calling for a full military mobilisation, according to Reuters. The statements added to the febrile situation in eastern Ukraine, where the rebels have ordered mass evacuations in the face of alleged shelling and mortar attacks by the Ukrainian army. The US president, Joe Biden, renewed his warnings on Friday night that a Russian invasion of its neighbour could happen at any time, and said that claims by pro-Moscow separatists in eastern Ukraine that they were under attack by Ukrainian government forces were “fabricated”. Monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said on Saturday they had seen a significant rise in the number of attacks along the front line, particularly in the separatist areas of Donetsk and Lugansk, fuelling western fears that Moscow could use it as a pretext for an invasion. The Pentagon also said that 40% of Russia’s estimated 150,000-strong forces on the border were in “attack position”. US officials think that the total number of troops is 190,000 when Ukrainian pro-Moscow rebels are included in the figure. Compounding western concern about Russia’s military buildup, Russia’s defence ministry announced that Putin would personally oversee drills on Saturday that will involve multiple practice missile launches. The Kremlin denies it has any plans to attack Ukraine and added to the war of words on Saturday morning by rejecting US allegations that it was responsible for cyber-attacks on Ukrainian banking and government websites earlier in the week. “We categorically reject these baseless statements of the administration and note that Russia has nothing to do with the mentioned events and in principle has never conducted and does not conduct any ‘malicious’ operations in cyberspace,” the Russian embassy in the US said on Twitter. The US deputy national security adviser, Anne Neuberger, said on Friday that Russian military intelligence was behind the recent spate of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that briefly knocked Ukrainian banking and government websites offline. Speaking in Washington on Friday night, Biden said that the invasion would come in the next week or days and that his Russian counterpart Putin had “made the decision” to invade. But Biden left the door open for a diplomatic resolution. “Russia has a choice between war and all the suffering it will bring or diplomacy that will make a future for everyone,” Biden said at the White House. “[Putin’s] focused on trying to convince the world he has the ability to change the dynamics in Europe in a way that he cannot,” Bided added. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was due to travel to Germany on Saturday to meet western leaders at the Munich security conference, including the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss. But Biden questioned whether it was a “wise choice” for Ukraine’s leader to leave his country as war fears reached a fever pitch. There were growing fears that a spark, which Washington warns could be a deliberate “false flag” incident orchestrated by Moscow, could set off the largest military confrontation in Europe since the second world war. The Nato chief, Jens Stoltenberg, who will also be at the Munich security conference, warned the size of the assembled Russian force far exceeded that needed for military drills, and that Russia had the capacity to invade without warning. France and Germany have urged Russia to use its influence on rebels in Ukraine’s disputed east to “encourage restraint and contribute to de-escalation”. An Agence France-Presse reporter near the front between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists in the Lugansk region heard explosions and saw damaged civilian buildings on Kyiv’s side of the line. Officials told local media that 25,000 people had left Lugansk and more than 6,000 had left Donetsk for Russia. There were reports of long car queues at checkpoints in Donetsk. Seeking to reverse the aggressor narrative, Moscow-backed leaders have accused Kyiv of planning an offensive to retake the eastern territories. The evacuations of civilians there were said to be in response to worries about a government attack. Russian news agencies quoted officials in Lugansk saying there had been two explosions within an hour on a gas pipeline but the fires were under control. But the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who will meet his Russian counterpart for talks on Thursday, according to Biden, accused the Kremlin of mounting a propaganda campaign to create an excuse for war. Biden again ruled out sending US troops into Ukraine, but his administration reiterated that it would hit Moscow with costly sanctions that would transform Russia into “a pariah to the international community”.",News/World news,Ukraine rebels order full mobilisation as Putin oversees missile launch drills,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/ukraine-rebels-order-full-mobilisation-as-putin-oversees-missile-launch-drills
2/19/2022,"George Santayana’s aphorism “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it” doesn’t make an appearance in this book. But it could well serve as the subtitle. For if ever a field should heed the lessons of history it is the making of policy on alcohol and other drugs, and their associated addictions. Carl Erik Fisher takes the reader on a vivid tour over several thousand years of multiple cycles of science, medicine and literature, woven together by the thread of the author’s own alcohol and amphetamine addiction and treatment. It is made even more emphatic and moving because he is also a psychiatrist who treats such patients. At the end of 2021, the British government set out a “once in a lifetime” policy for tackling drug crime and drug use. It was a remarkable document not least because it contained no references to any previous research in this field – as if the last two millennia had taught us nothing. The authors of that report should now read this book and realise how wrong most of their ideas are, how their new vision will probably repeat a relentless cycle of failed policy approaches. Given that they are unlikely to do so, I will try to summarise the key messages from Fisher’s book.  Those are, first: don’t conflate drug use with addiction or even with harm – heed the research by Lee Robins on Vietnam vets, for example, which showed that most of those who used heroin in that war stopped once they returned to a normal life. Punitively extending the tentacles of drug-testing is harmful, because many will fail at some point, become marginalised and be driven from legal work into crime. Second, abstinence isn’t the only – or even necessarily the safest – goal of treatment. We know this because of the major contribution of methadone and, more recently, buprenorphine to opioid addiction treatment, though neither of them are yet fully utilised. Third, do not “wage war” on drugs, because that instantly becomes a war on drug users, with poor, non-white and disadvantaged people the most likely victims. Of course, none of these insights will be a surprise to experts in this field – they are established facts. But this book is not a polemic, and one of its pleasures is the succession of historical nuggets it serves up, many of which were unknown to me. For example, the word “addiction” was used for the first time in reference to chocolate. I was also unaware of the deliberate use of cheap alcohol to undermine Native American communities by the early white settlers. This led to the Code of Handsome Lake, the first mutual support group explicitly focused on addiction recovery in America, predating Alcoholics Anonymous by almost 150 years, and surviving to this day. Though I was familiar with the presumed role of cannabis and ephedra in the origins of Hinduism, I had not realised that gambling addiction appeared so early in literature, in the Rig Veda: hearing the sound of dice, the gambler rushes to them “like a girl with her lover”. He “goes to the hall of play asking himself, ‘Will I win?’ puffing himself up with ‘I will win!’” The book is rich with similarly potent quotations, among them two that capture the different faces of alcoholism. This one from Edgar Allan Poe, who died very young from the effects of drinking, sums up the paradox of self-destructiveness: “the unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itself, to offer violence to its own nature, to do wrong for the wrong’s sake”. Whereas Caroline Knapp describes how “liquor occupies the role of a lover or constant companion”. William Burroughs recounts that “heroin is momentary freedom from the claims of the ageing, cautious, nagging, frightened flesh”. Which of us hasn’t had similar longings to escape? And then there’s Fisher’s own remarkablestory, which includes an amphetamine-induced manic episode during which he was Tasered by the police before being forcibly taken into detox. Months later, on his first weekend leave from rehab, he describes walking back into his lonely apartment and finding the Taser wires “tangled on the floor, like a loose, copper bird’s nest”. The child of two alcohol and smoking addicts, he explores the reasons for both their and his vulnerability, though he cautions that “it is rarely useful to attempt to arrive at one major ‘cause’ of anyone’s addiction”. His mother, he writes, learned from her stressed immigrant father that “alcohol was a way to cope with a difficult world”. Even when she is dying from lung cancer she still drinks, though it messes with her treatments, and has an expert doctor as a son trying to stop her. His parents’ denial of their addictions translated into his own failure to recognise when his drinking had become out of control. Fisher is now working as an addiction psychiatrist and medical ethicist, but still undergoes regular alcohol and drug testing that he feels helps keep him clean – though it hasn’t been as successful among other medical professionals in his treatment group. If testing often fails among these people, what hope has it with those who have little or no incentive? Fisher argues that non-judgmental encouragement and understanding is the right approach. The book is thorough and revealing. It is largely US-centric, but, given the overwhelming influence that country has had in driving global drug policies, the narrative is still internationally relevant. Fisher’s personal saga, together with case studies of his patients, lend it an additional human depth. Pulling it all together is this final reflection, a mature view of the topic from someone with immense experience of it. “Addiction is profoundly ordinary: a way of being with the pleasures and pains of life, and just one manifestation of the central human task of working with suffering. If addiction is part of humanity, then, it is not a problem to solve. We will not end addiction, but we must find ways of working with it: ways that are sometimes gentle, and sometimes vigorous, but never warlike, because it is futile to wage a war on our own nature.” One can only hope the British government – and others like it around the world – is listening.
