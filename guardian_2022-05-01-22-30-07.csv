5/1/2022,"The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has defended himself against accusations that his approach to Russian aggression has been hesitant and timid, insisting his decisions followed close consultation with Germany’s allies and sought to avoid any suspicion that the country was “going it alone”. Scholz has faced fierce criticism even from within his own government and last week came under particular fire from the opposition leader, Friedrich Merz, who accused him of weak leadership and of “procrastination, dithering and timidity”. On Sunday it was reported that Merz was planning to travel to Kyiv on Monday. Scholz appeared to bow to immense domestic and international pressure last week by announcing that Germany would deliver heavy weaponry to Ukraine, in the form of self-propelled anti-aircraft systems, in what was seen as a sharp policy U-turn. But while the outspoken Ukrainian ambassador to Berlin, Andriy Melnyk, said he welcomed the move, he piled further pressure on Scholz on Sunday by insisting it did not go nearly far enough, and demanding more “fantasy and courage” from Germany. Responding to the criticism in an interview with the tabloid Bild am Sonntag, Scholz said: “I am making my decisions quickly and in conjunction with our allies.” He said that “overhasty actions and Germany going it alone” would be viewed with suspicion. Scholz said: “I am not fearful enough to allow myself to be affected by such accusations.” He insisted he would not be cowed into changing his strategy by his record-low popularity rating. “You should notice opinion polls but you should not make your actions dependent on them. Especially regarding questions of war and peace, this would be immensely dangerous,” he said. According to the polling institute Insa, 54% of Germans are unhappy with Scholz’s record. Scholz, who has been in office for just under five months, found himself plunged early on into dealing with the dilemma faced by almost every government leader since the second world war – having to tread a thin line between Germany assuming international responsibilities and avoiding accusations both at home and abroad that its actions might drag Europe into another war. Melnyk, who has himself drawn criticism within Germany for his persistent complaints about what he has repeatedly described as the country’s lack of decisive action, said that the Gepard anti-aircraft guns promised last week were insufficient and too old. “The direction is the right one, but of course they are not enough. In particular we’re lacking ammunition for the Gepards ... and in addition they are 40 years old. In order to defeat Russia we need the most modern Germany weaponry,” he said, also speaking to Bild. He said his criticism was directed at “the entire German political class”, accusing Germany of being “very wrapped up in itself” and urging it to “at last become aware of its enormous historical responsibility”. Melnyk listed the specific arms he said Ukraine needed Germany to deliver. “We want the speedy export of 88 Leopard tanks, 100 Marder armoured personnel carriers, self-propelled howitzers and much more. We are experiencing the biggest war in Europe for 80 years. It cannot be won with 30 or 100 more anti-aircraft systems.” Melnyk acknowledged that Germany had taken in a large number of refugees from Ukraine, including his own mother-in-law. Officially the figure is just under 400,000, according to German border police, although the real number is believed to be much higher as they are not required to register and can be in Germany without a visa for 90 days. “I am grateful to Germany for every help it gives. But we’re talking about life and death in Ukraine, and the survival of my nation,” he said. As debate raged among policymakers in Germany as to when and whether Germany can become independent from Russian gas supplies, the news agency DPA reported that the government was planning to support EU plans for a Russian oil embargo, as part of a sixth round of sanctions about to be announced by the bloc, despite opposition from Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, Spain, Italy and Greece. Germany has already reduced its dependence on Russian gas from 55% to 35% since the start of the war, but full independence is not expected to be reached until 2024, Robert Habeck, the economics minister, has said.",News/World news,Scholz defends Ukraine policy as criticism mounts in Germany ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/01/scholz-defends-ukraine-policy-as-criticism-mounts-in-germany
5/1/2022,"Even on a spring night blighted by a sudden cold snap, this production emanates the end of gloom and the start of a glorious summer. Set in April 1945 in northern Italy, days before the defeat of Mussolini’s fascist forces, there is a palpable sense of celebration as the heroes of war are welcomed back, with wine, singing and a troupe of accordionists. Lucy Bailey’s production is a thoroughly elegant one, with stylish gowns, leisurely timing and fluid movement across the stage’s various parts. Joanna Parker’s set is designed as one great garden, an aptly pastoral setting for the play’s two love stories, with climbing ivy across the back and islands of green turf at the front. The flora gives a traditionally romantic backdrop to the storyline between Hero (Nadi Kemp-Sayfi) and Claudio (Patrick Osborne) but also works well with the jousting flirtation between Benedick (Ralph Davis) and Beatrice (Lucy Phelps); the foliage is central to the comedy when they are tricked to fall in love with each other. A gender-reversed Leonata (Katy Stephens) gives an especially strong performance, alongside Davis and Phelps, whose verbal swordplay sparkles with intelligence and mischief. The chemistry between Kemp-Sayfi and Osborne is slightly more tepid and their romance – on which the central plot pivots – feels a little secondary. The comic scenes featuring the watchman, Dogberry (George Fouracres) and his crew – tricky ones that can easily feel protracted – are full of clarity and finesse here. This is largely down to Fouracres’ talents and it does not matter that the character of Boracio, normally performed by Ciarán O’Brien, is here played by Philip Cumbus with script in hand (he even manages to squeeze a laugh out of his script reading). There is a gentleness and restraint to the comedy altogether, though, rather than raucousness and the drama has a decidedly English look and feel despite its Italian setting, with its herbaceous borders, lawnmowers and village-hall style paper-chains. It ambles in pace, refusing to be rushed, it seems, and savouring every line of Shakespeare’s text. But arrive at the wedding that will turn the play its shade of dark two hours into the show – which feels too late – and the comic scenes might have gathered a more madcap momentum if executed slightly faster. There is arguably not enough force when the drama turns darker, either, in the public shaming of Hero by Claudio, at their aborted wedding. The production as a whole seems to want to stick to gaiety and gambolling. Even the play’s central schemer, Don John (Olivier Huband), has deadpan humour. It works to create a consummately summer comedy, its lightness carrying an edge of our own post-lockdown lifting of the clouds.

5/1/2022,"This was not in Celtic’s script. At 1-0 up here, Ange Postecoglou’s team were on course to secure the title barring some crossing of t’s and dotting of i’s. Victory would have sent Celtic nine points – and more than 20 goals – ahead of their oldest foes. Rangers were not of a mind to let that scenario transpire. Celtic remain the firm favourites to win the Premiership but Rangers will regard this draw as a moral victory. More so, indeed, because they completely deserved it. The width of a post prevented Fashion Sakala from handing Rangers an even better outcome, just days before the second leg of their Europa League semi-final against RB Leipzig. Jota handed Celtic the lead after capitalising on lazy defending from Borna Barisic when meeting a Daizen Maeda cross. Rangers’ Ryan Kent had missed an identical chance earlier in proceedings. Jota and Maeda passed up opportunities to double Celtic’s lead before the break. Maeda was again wasteful 20 minutes after the restart, a moment Rangers capitalised on. Sakala played a neat one-two with Kent before slamming home at Joe Hart’s near post. The ferocity of the shot left the former England goalkeeper helpless. Sakala had three chances to claim victory for Rangers. The woodwork denied the Zambian with the best of them. Celtic appealed in vain for a penalty after the ball struck John Lundstram’s arm from a Tom Rogic cross. At full-time, the home support acclaimed their players in a manner which suggested a title party was imminent; the underlying issue being that those in green and white had been of a mind to begin the celebrations here.",Sport/Football,Celtic close in on title despite Sakala salvaging derby draw for Rangers,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/01/celtic-rangers-scottish-premiership-match-report
5/1/2022,"The war in Ukraine will not affect the timing of a second independence referendum, Nicola Sturgeon has said, as she refused to rule out court action after Scotland’s information commissioner ordered her government to publish its legal advice on holding a second poll. The Scottish National party leader and first minister also challenged the UK government to take a four nations approach to mitigating the cost of living crisis, just as happened during the pandemic. Amid growing fears that the Russia-Ukraine conflict will continue into next year, Sturgeon said: “I’ve not changed my position on the timescale we won the mandate for in the election last year.” Sturgeon was speaking on board the SNP’s canary yellow campaign bus after knocking on doors around Glasgow with candidates for this Thursday’s council elections. The party’s local manifesto includes a reiteration of its 2021 Holyrood election commitment to hold a second independence referendum by the end of 2023. There has been increasing speculation that the ongoing war in Europe could impact this timetable, and that the party’s stance on a Trident-free independent Scotland is out of step with public mood at a time of international conflict. Sturgeon acknowledged that “everybody in the European Union is fundamentally rethinking defence and security” but insists this does not amount to the need for a more flexible policy around nuclear weapons post-independence. “My party is very strongly in principle and for practical reasons against nuclear weapons, and that’s not going to change. We’ve got to remember that the vast majority of countries in the world don’t have nuclear weapons.” The question of Nato membership has divided nationalist opinion - the SNP changed policy in 2012 to remaining within the alliance if Scotland becomes independent, prompting the resignation of 3 MSPs. Sturgeon said her party has to be “much more engaged” in the question of what an independent Scotland would bring to Nato. “What would be the specialisms and the expertise that we could put on the table, to be a much much more constructive partner in that security alliance?” Last week, Scotland’s Information Commissioner ordered Sturgeon’s government to publish its legal advice on whether it would have the requisite powers to hold a second referendum without Westminster’s consent – which Boris Johnson has consistently refused – following a lengthy FOI battle with the Scotsman. Are ministers planning to publish that information or challenge the ruling in court? “The Commissioner’s made his ruling, there’s now a June 10 deadline, any government is going to carefully consider all aspects of that and I’m not going to pre-empt that consideration,” said Sturgeon. “The question is not whether the Scottish government will comply with the law. We will. The question is whether political opponents and actually democrats are willing to argue their case democratically and allow the people to decide”. The SNP, the largest party of local government and now in power at Holyrood for 15 years, is facing serious challenges to its reputation for competence, including delays and mismanagement of vital ferry services and soaring NHS waiting times while there has been outcry at funding cuts handed down to local services following the latest Scottish budget. But latest polling suggests that the party will maintain its dominance, although the latest Panelbase tracker for the Sunday Times has support for the party down six points since last November. Scottish Labour is expected to push the Conservatives into third place, as pro-union voters react to Partygate. But with the constitution continuing to steer voter choice, elections expert Sir John Curtice has pointed out that every poll in Scotland is a “quasi-referendum”. “The anger about Partygate, feeding into and being fed by the anger and genuine distress people are feeling about the cost of living is palpable,” said Sturgeon. She was dismissive of the latest comments by Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross that Johnson was “fit for office”, despite previously calling for the prime minister to resign. “He got, rightly, some credit for doing that – not easy within his own party – but then to make the U-turn he’s made and now argue against all evidence to the contrary that Boris Johnson is actually fit to be prime minister, makes him look unprincipled, inconsistent, lacking resolve and a bit silly.” At her party’s council manifesto launch, Sturgeon promised a “pandemic-level” response to the cost of living crisis, highlighting the doubling of the new weekly child payment for low income families, the council tax reduction scheme and efforts to reduce fuel poverty. Now she is calling for a concerted four-nations effort, as happened throughout the Covid crisis, a point she says she raised last week with Michael Gove. “Inevitably that has to involve much more action on the part of the UK government because most of the resources and levers do lie there … I suggested we haven’t proper four nations discussion with actual proposals on the table from all four nations with the Treasury there, properly engaged.” Scotland elects councillors by proportional representation, making coalitions and minority administrations the norm, but Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, has ruled out deals with other parties. “What that says to me,” she said, “is that Anas Sarwar is a politician deep in opposition mindset, that he is not somebody who is yet anywhere close to thinking about what it means to be in power and take responsibility”. “In an STV election, if you have that position then you’re effectively freezing yourself in opposition.”",News/Politics,"Ukraine war will not affect independence poll, says Sturgeon",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/01/ukraine-war-will-not-affect-independence-poll-says-sturgeon
5/1/2022,"Nuclear power advocates believe energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng is open to extending the life of the Hinkley Point B plant to help wean the UK off gas imports and prevent a faster-than-expected decline in Britain’s fleet of atomic reactors. Soaring gas prices and the war in Ukraine have already spurred the government to ask coal power plant owners to stay open longer, while ministers also revisited their staunch opposition to fracking in the light of energy supply concerns. There is a growing feeling in the nuclear industry and its supporters that Kwarteng could also be persuaded to back an extension of up to 18 months to the life of Hinkley Point B, which is due to stop generating electricity this summer. Such a plan, which would chime with Boris Johnson’s backing for new nuclear in the recent energy security plan, would keep 1GW of electricity generation on the National Grid in the short term, replacing the need for gas-fired generation for up to 1.5m homes. Conservative MP Ian Liddell-Grainger, whose Bridgwater and West Somerset constituency includes Hinkley, said he had spoken to Kwarteng about the possibility and that he was “definitely” open to it. “Kwasi is no fool,” he said. “He understands the stresses and strains we’re going through and that we need to look at everything we can. They are fully aware of what the [Hinkley] B station is capable of. She’s old but she’s in good health.” Hinkley’s owner, EDF Energy, would have to produce a safety case for extending the life of a power station that was hooked up to the grid in 1976 and whose closure was previously postponed by seven years in 2012. EDF would have to prove to the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) that the ageing graphite rods in the plant’s reactors could be inserted, even in the event of a huge and unprecedented earthquake, to prevent a nuclear accident. One nuclear industry source said there was a “six-week window” left, during which EDF could still make that case in time for the ONR to give a verdict on the safety of the plans and postpone the scheduled end to Hinkley generating electricity on 15 July. Greg Hands, a junior minister in Kwarteng’s business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) department, visited Hinkley last week. Engineers there are understood to have told Hands that they expected the plant to shut as scheduled. But the nuclear industry source said that while engineers were naturally focused on shutdown plans they had been working towards for many months, senior figures at EDF were likely to be more open to extending Hinkley’s life. The ONR would ultimately decide on whether such a plan could go ahead but Kwarteng’s approval is crucial. This is because EDF would incur significant costs to put together a safety case for an extension and would need to be confident that ministers would not block it. EDF declined to comment on whether it was planning to do so. BEIS said it had not held any discussions about such a proposal. “It [extending Hinkley] would stop you having to import a chunk of gas,” said the nuclear industry source. The Guardian also understands that Torness, near Dunbar, and Heysham 2 in Lancashire could come off grid earlier than expected, depending on regular assessments of the state of their graphite rods. Their retirement has already been brought forward, with EDF saying earlier this year that they would stop generating in 2028, rather than 2030. In theory, each station that operates for a year can replace more than 1bn cubic metres of gas imports. While nuclear power is traditionally expensive, the sky-high price of gas in recent months, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, means the £45 per megawatt hour that EDF gets from its nuclear contract is significantly below wholesale market power prices. Trade unions Prospect and the GMB have also called for the life of Britain’s nuclear fleet to be extended. Pressure on Kwarteng to signal to EDF that the government would back plans to keep Hinkley Point B open comes against the backdrop of concern that the capacity of Britain’s nuclear fleet could be declining even faster than thought. Based on current projections for the retirement of reactors and the building of new ones, UK nuclear capacity will fall from 5.8GW today to 4.4GW in 2028, factoring in the construction of Hinkley Point C but also the end of life of Torness and Heysham. However, the 2028 completion date for Hinkley Point C, which is already over budget and behind schedule is under review, with a forecast due this summer.",News/Environment,Hinkley Point B nuclear plant could be spared imminent closure,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/01/hinkley-point-b-nuclear-plant-could-be-spared-imminent-closure
5/1/2022,"In the final minutes of the final episode of the genre-defining mockumentary The Office, our favourite disenchanted worker, Tim (Martin Freeman), neatly summarises the banal rhythms of the early 2000s workplace. “The people you work with are people you were just thrown together with,” he muses, noting that he spends more time with colleagues than his own friends or family. “But probably all you’ve got in common,” he adds, rubbing his nose, “is the fact that you walk around on the same bit of carpet for eight hours a day.” Ricky Gervais’s sitcom was rightly celebrated for its unvarnished depiction of the mundane, tedious and often soul-destroying reality of office life, but – hang on. Eight hours a day? Carpet? Walking around? Twenty years and two recessions later, the monotonies of Tim’s office environment almost look like perks. Cosy carpets have been replaced by sleek, characterless hard floors. In 2021, desk workers slogged for two extra hours a day, regularly logging off at 8pm. And monitoring software means overworked and underpaid employees barely have time to stop for a natter, let alone set their co-worker’s stapler in jelly (for the third time). Today, on the world’s 136th International Workers’ Day, we can see how recent cultural depictions of the workplace reflect these changed realities, and arguably reveal an even greater disillusionment with office life. The sci-fi series Severance, which debuted on Apple TV in February, follows employees of a mysterious, mammoth corporation who have had their work selves and home selves surgically split, so that the former have no memories of the latter’s lives (and vice versa). While Tim lamented seeing his colleagues more often than his loved ones, the “severed” employees of Lumon Industries have lost all of their intimate memories – they know nothing of their family and friends outside the office. Arriving at their desks with zero recollection of the night before leads to the unsettling sensation that they’ve been permanently at work. And then there’s HBO’s dark comedy Succession, a bleak portrait of life at the top of a cutthroat family empire – and BBC’s Industry, which conversely portrays life at the very bottom, as graduates forgo sleep while they compete for jobs at an investment bank. There’s a precariousness in both that wasn’t as present in pre-recession workplace dramas; a sense that at any moment everything could be lost. “There’s a feeling captured in 90s and 2000s pre-crash media, that sense that you were bored and stuck at work,” says Amelia Horgan, a philosophy PhD student at the University of Essex and author of an examination of modern employment, Lost in Work, “whereas the dominant feeling now is the fear that the rug will be pulled out from under your feet without you realising, very quickly.” Ash Atalla is an expert on how fictional workplaces have changed over the years – he produced both The Office and mid-00s IT department comedy The IT Crowd, and more recently, the estate agent sitcom Stath Lets Flats. “I think the trend is to go bigger on the world of work,” he says, noting that shows today focus on multinational corporations, not minor paper companies like The Office’s Wernham Hogg. “Now it would be like, ‘Who owns Wernham Hogg? Where are they based? Are they based in Holland?’ You’d want to see the superstructure of it.” Perhaps that is because small companies are increasingly disappearing from our monopolised world – perhaps it reflects a growing awareness that our boss has a boss. While The Office focused on the haphazard mishaps of small-town buffoon David Brent, Succession centres on Murdoch-proxy Logan Roy, who eats small towns for breakfast. Rising inequality has led to greater scrutiny of the billionaire bosses at the top; you’re unlikely to finish your daily paper without reading something about Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk. “We’ve seen in the pandemic a massive transfer upwards of wealth, and we have a concentration of power and wealth,” Horgan says, “You can see a reflection of that.” It’s no wonder that powerlessness pervades depictions of the modern office – Severance’s memory-holed employees have no idea what the data they’re working on actually is, and the severance procedure means they can’t take the corporation’s shadowy secrets into the light of the outside world. Mark Scout, the show’s protagonist, is played by Adam Scott – previously most recognisable as local government worker Ben Wyatt in NBC’s Parks and Recreation. Wyatt worked at a place that made tangible impact on the local community, a place where employees believed in “working hard at work worth doing”. In episode two of Severance, Scout’s date observes: “So you don’t know who you work with, or what you do, or anything?” In Severance, escape is almost impossible – employees lodge complaints that go nowhere, and “code detectors” set off alarms when they try to get written messages into the outside world. Horgan notes that the theme of escape is present in a lot of modern workplace books; “There’s a surrealness in some of the new literature on work,” she says, “The way a desire for freedom is expressed is much more surreal.” She cites Kikuko Tsumura’s There’s No Such Thing As an Easy Job, in which a nameless narrator cycles through bizarre jobs as she searches for work that is “practically without substance”, and Lara Williams’s The Odyssey, about an alcoholic cruise worker who takes part in a cult-like employee-mentorship programme. In Ottessa Moshfegh’s My Year of Rest and Relaxation, another unnamed narrator takes powerful drugs in her quest to sleep for a year after becoming disillusioned with her work at a gallery. “The art world had turned out to be like the stock market, a reflection of political trends and the persuasions of capitalism, fuelled by greed and gossip and cocaine,” the protagonist laments. Even work that is meant to be creative and fulfilling is ultimately empty. “I was perfectly happy to wipe all that garbage from my mind.” Of course, workers in The Office felt equally trapped and cynical – but at least they got an hour’s lunch break. (According to a recent survey by pickle brand Branston, the average worker now takes a 29-minute break, during which they regularly check their emails.) Atalla laughs when I mention this. “You’re absolutely right – the other day, my PA went out for like an hour for lunch, and I remember being just like, ‘For fuck’s sake…’! I remember when I was young and doing work experience people would go out to a restaurant together …I do think that’s gone.” Rebecca Watson’s Little Scratch neatly illustrates the indignities of eating at your desk; a colleague who has sexually assaulted the narrator asks, “That taste nice?” as she’s eating, and she’s suddenly “struck by” the “phallic” nature of her breakfast. In fragmented, poetry-like prose, our unnamed protagonist (noticing a pattern?) later pleads, “maybe one day/I’ll leave!/(please)/of course I will/right”. Taken together, these books and TV shows mirror how employees feel they are nameless, personality-less cogs in increasingly centralised machines. Over the course of the last year, the so-called Great Resignation has meant that many workers have seemingly escaped their dreary jobs – but questions have already arisen about whether there’s anywhere better to escape to. For all its mundanity, The Office never went full-blown bleak (one colleague might ask you, “Will there ever be a boy born who can swim faster than a shark?” but another might turn out to be the love of your life). But such hope and humanity may be absent from the next wave of pop-culture workplaces. Gruelling gig-economy jobs, timed loo breaks, enforced commutes after months of working from home, rising bills, closing companies, the looming threat of redundancy – the desperations of 21st-century capitalism have been neatly reflected in Korean dramas such as Squid Game and Parasite, and it’s unlikely the depictions will end there. There’s brutality at the heart of the new workplace drama, as there often is at the modern workplace itself.",Arts/Culture,From The Office to Severance: how the fictional workplace went from bad to worse,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/01/from-the-office-to-severance-fictional-workplace
5/1/2022,"Why there is no culture of salami-making in the UK? It’s not the weather, because Lombardy has worse conditions for processing than Norfolk. Lawrence Hallett Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com. Because of the damp climate. You need low humidity to air-cure without mould spoilage. That’s also why we don’t have air-dried hams like those from Italy and Spain. merchycwm We do make salami in the UK on an amateur basis. You actually require a minimum humidity of around 80%, otherwise the outside of the salami dries before the centre, which causes “case hardening”. Good salami will have a coating of mould. It needs to be the right mould, so you impregnate the salami with the appropriate one. simonhbacon I’m not sure this is true. I used to live in a very remote mountainous part of south-west China that was famous for its rain and humidity, but the country tradition of killing a pig and curing it for the winter – including whole legs – was very much alive (even if the pig very much wasn’t). Having said that, this used to be the British tradition too, where a pig would be killed and its meat cured to last the family throughout the winter. I suppose this would have been in the form of ham and/or bacon rather than the salami-type sausages you get throughout most of Europe? Just speculation. BluebellWood I’ve just read something from a British charcuterie-maker, a family firm started in the early 19th century, who reckons there was a big tradition of British air-dried pork products, but it didn’t survive the industrial revolution. Le74 I’m sure the weather must have something to do with it. Here in Spain, for example, chorizo and morcilla (black pudding) are normally salt-dried, whereas in Asturias and the north (where it rains even more than in parts of UK), it is traditionally smoked. Likewise, people in the north don’t eat as much cured ham because it doesn’t keep with the damp climate. David Smith I would have thought that the UK climate was usually not severe enough to prevent feeding pigs then slaughtering for fresh meat. Salami-type sausages are basically a way of preserving meat to last the winter. Geoffrey Peter It’s definitely not a question of the weather – Germany does have a salami culture and has a lot less mild weather than the UK. However, the lack of homegrown salami ties in with a general lack charcuterie in the UK. Many European countries have long and consequently comprehensive traditions of charcuterie, of which salami is just a tiny part. In the UK, this sort of thing is limited to cooked ham and to sausages that taste more of bread than actual British bread. So the correct question wouldn’t be why the UK has no culture of salami-making, but rather why the UK doesn’t have many different, local types of charcuterie. I have no idea – it might be because agriculture was industrialised much, much earlier in the UK than on the continent. On the continent, farmers processed their own products until shortly after the second world war, whereas I assume in the UK the processing was industrialised and outsourced a lot sooner. Doing the processing yourself lends itself to the development of many, very regional types of charcuterie. I can only speak for Germany, but to this day farmers that otherwise work in a farming cooperative will raise one or two pigs and when they are slaughtered – on the farm, not in a slaughterhouse – their meat is made into local types of charcuterie. Often this is accompanied by a feast where others are invited, and various pork products are afterwards gifted to friends. Additionally, in central Europe, charcuterie is part of the traditional breakfast alongside cheese (and widely available with butchers and supermarkets), and, at least in Germany, it’s also part of the evening meal (the main meal of the day is the midday meal, so the evening meal is not cooked). You’ll want some variety of sliced meats you can put on bread if you eat two meals of this kind per day. In the UK, cheese and charcuterie have little to do with breakfast, and most Brits I know eat either predominantly in the form of cheese and/or charcuterie boards. There was a time when there was very little variety of cheeses in the UK, but cheesemaking has undergone a revival, and many (but not all) traditional types of cheese are produced again. Maybe charcuterie will undergo such a revival too at some point and local types of charcuterie will flourish. kate7805 In the 1960s, Jane Grigson was writing about the lower-fat content of British pigs becoming less suitable for charcuterie. The prize in breeding and husbandry had seen as lower fat content for most of the 20th century. Official reports had reinforced the trend by suggesting a concentration on just three breeds for British pigs that would concentrate on production of fresh pork and bacon. The result was the disappearance of higher-fat traditional breeds, such as the Lincolnshire curly coat and the Cumberland, and much of the tradition of preserved pork products that would expect a higher fat content. Made with modern breeds, some of the speciality pork products do continue, such as Cumberland sausage and Lincolnshire chine, but they’re not quite the same product as would be seen 100 years ago. leadballoon Looking at the question from the other end, it may also have something to do with the easy availability of salt in Britain. With coastlines handy for almost everywhere, and the Cheshire salt mines as well, salt could easily be traded in large quantities throughout the country – look how many roads and footpaths are still called Saltergate or Salters Lane – and nobody needed to go to the effort of preserving meat in the form of air-dried sausages, which would, as pointed out above, have been a risky business in our damp, maritime climate. SpoilheapSurfer This is a query rather than an answer, but I understand that the Inquisition required households to keep some pork products in store as a proof of not being Jewish. As Britain had no Jews (until relatively recently), having expelled them in the early middle ages, perhaps there was not as much of a driver to keep pork in long-term storage, and it could be used up as and when available? Paulo777 I’ve certainly read that the reason Spanish cuisine is heavily based on pork products was that a sausage a day kept the Inquisition away. Not sure that the rest of the theory holds water, though, as the period during which Jews were banned from England was relatively short: the ban was repealed during the Commonwealth in the mid-17th century. SpoilheapSurfer The Irish don’t do salami either, but we do make a lovely cured pork shoulder, which I have not seen elsewhere in the world. Then there is black pudding and white pudding (mmmm) which is nothing like German cold black pudding blutwurst (don’t even try to fry it, retch). Gobsheisse Just an idea, but in my part of Italy, where people (including my own extended family) still make their own salami, almost all houses have deep stone cellars, where cheese is aged and cured meats are hung. It could be that salami-making is linked to a mixture of common architectural traditions and climate (temperature swings – extremes of cold and/or heat). In these cellars, the temperature stays around 12C during summer and winter (although outside in winter the temperature drops to below -10C and in the summer rises to well over 30C), day and night, and the humidity needs to be quite stable too. It would have been impossible to store food properly in summer or winter in sheds or even parlours. In the building I’m in right now, some of the cellars are three storeys underground, and that’s true throughout the town. valleyhumanoid This is a great article with a bit of marketing right at the very end but quite fascinating.

Signals relayed by automated telescope arrays and underground detectors will reveal that a star in our galactic neighbourhood has just turned supernova. A supernova occurs when a star destroys itself so completely it can outshine the combined light of an entire galaxy. In the last thousand years, only five have ever been visible to the naked eye. Ironically, all occurred before the invention of the telescope. “We know about supernovae from their appearance in other galaxies and from remnants left behind in our own galaxy,” says Smartt, an astrophysicist based at Queen’s University Belfast. “But what we would love to do is see one that appears fairly near us so we can study it with modern telescopes and detectors.” When a supernova erupts, it sprays the cosmos with heavy elements – so observing one nearby would provide precious information about the creation of matter in our galaxy. “Most elements heavier than oxygen were created in a supernova before being hurled across space,” says Prof Mark Sullivan of the University of Southampton. “These atoms provide the galaxy with material essential to life. The calcium in your bones and the iron in your blood – as well as the gold in the ring on your finger – were all created in supernovae explosions.” It is an image that continues to entrance writers and artists. In Jeanette Winterson’s words, astronomers have shown our first true parent was actually a star and that we are made of elements that are “the long-lived radioactive nuclear waste of the supernova bang”. Or, as Joni Mitchell put it, more simply: “We are stardust.” The most common type of supernova occurs when a very large star runs out of fuel, halting the nuclear fusion process that keeps it shining. The star’s outer layers fall inwards, and protons and electrons are crushed together to form neutrons that become packed into a superdense ball. Matter continues to rain down on this neutron ball before bouncing back, triggering a shock wave that destroys the star. All that is left behind is a neutron sphere that is so dense a matchbox of it would weigh about 3bn tonnes. And if the original progenitor star that led to the supernova was particularly large, this neutron star will become so heavy it will form a black hole from which nothing can escape, not even light. This is a core-collapse supernova and it can unleash more energy than our sun will release over its entire 10bn-year lifetime. If a star in our galaxy, too distant to be seen by the naked eye on Earth, becomes a supernova, it will suddenly shine so brilliantly it could be seen in daylight. Scientists estimate that on average about 20 supernovae occur in a galaxy such as ours every thousand years. Yet only five have been observed in the last millennium. East Asian and Arabic records indicate there were supernovae in 1006, 1054 and 1181, while European documents recall ones that occurred in 1572 and 1604. The first of this last pair flashed into sight in November 1572 and was observed by the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe. “Overhead, a certain strange star was suddenly seen, flashing its light with a radiant gleam,” he recalled. “I stood still, gazing … When I had satisfied myself that no star of that kind had ever shone forth before, I was led into such perplexity by the unbelievability of the thing that I began to doubt the faith of my own eyes.” But if supernovae are so brilliant, why have we only detected five in the past 1,000 years? Why have we not seen a number that is nearer the 20 suggested by observations of other galaxies? The answer is straightforward, says Sullivan. “Our galaxy is like a flat plate and our solar system is about two-thirds of the way towards its edge. A supernova that occurs on the other side of the plate will simply be obscured by all the dust and stars that lie at the centre of the galaxy.” Astronomers have since observed supernovae in other galaxies and studied remnants of those that have occurred inside our galaxy. These include the glowing filaments of the Crab Nebula, the remains of the supernova that lit up night skies in 1054AD and which have since been spreading across space. Galactic debris such as this reveals the enormous destruction that is unleashed by supernovae. Yet these stellar convulsions are also important engines of creation, scientists argue. Apart from spraying the cosmos with heavy elements on which life depends, they also play a key role in planet and star formation, says astrophysicist Cosimo Inserra of Cardiff University. “A supernova sends shock waves across a galaxy and these strike clouds of gas and dust in space, compressing them so that proto-stars start to form at their centres. Eventually, nuclear fusion begins, igniting a star’s store of hydrogen and it starts to shine. Planets form and orbit the star. That is probably how our sun and solar system came into existence.” Supernovae do pose threats, nevertheless. “If one occurred within 20 parsecs – roughly 60 light years – of the Earth, its intense cosmic rays could destroy our protective ozone layer, which would allow increased levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun to reach us,” says Sullivan. However, only one very close to Earth could have such an impact and at present there are no candidate stars near us that look ready to annihilate themselves this way, he adds. On the other hand, it is also clear supernovae have exploded near Earth in the past. As evidence, scientists point to the discovery of a radioactive isotope of iron – known as iron-60 – that has been found in seabed deposits laid down 2.5m years ago and in other deposits created about 7m years ago. Iron-60 is produced by supernovae and these deposits suggest at least two must have erupted near Earth within the last 10m years, probably at a distance of about 100 parsecs, or 320 light years. What impact that had on the planet is uncertain. “You might have had a rise in cosmic-ray activity and this might have affected cloud formation on Earth or reduced the amount of solar radiation reaching the ground,” says Prof John Ellis of King’s College London. “This could then have triggered a change in the climate, which in turn could have affected the course of human evolution.” Apart from the rather startling prospect that the appearance of Homo sapiens might have been shaped by local supernovae, these discoveries also suggest there might have been enough of them to have had a real influence on life earlier in our planet’s history. “If you find two that happened fairly near Earth within the past 10m years, that suggests hundreds must have appeared over the past billion years,” argues Ellis. “Some of them will have been quite distant … but a few would have been close, say 10 parsecs away. And we should be clear: if a supernova went off within 10 parsecs of our planet, it would very likely have caused a mass extinction.” Earth has experienced at least five mass extinctions that have each eradicated thousands of species of animals, plants and sea creatures, and at least one of these was caused by an extraterrestrial agent: an asteroid that struck Earth at the end of the Cretaceous period 66m years ago, wiping out the dinosaurs. Earth-based catastrophes – such as large-scale volcanism – have been blamed for the other mass extinctions. However, scientists now suspect that in one other case, an otherworldly event was to blame. They point to rocks that formed at the end of the Devonian period 360m years ago when there was another mass extinction that wiped out ammonites, trilobites and other early forms of life. These rocks contain hundreds of thousands of generations of plant spores that appear to be sunburnt by ultraviolet light – evidence of a long-lasting ozone-depletion event, says astronomer Brian Fields at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. “We propose that one or more supernova explosions, about 65 light years from Earth, could have been responsible for the protracted loss of ozone,” he argues. This blast would have first bathed Earth with powerful X-rays and gamma rays before debris from the blast slammed into the planet, stripping it of its protective ozone layer. This astronomical double whammy would have exposed the planet’s surface to deadly radiation for up to 100,000 years and led to a mass extinction. Further proof for this idea is now being sought by scientists. They have discounted looking for iron-60 atoms because these decay too quickly to have survived the 360m years since the late Devonian mass extinction. Instead, they plan to seek out atoms of the isotope plutonium-244, which is also produced by supernovae and could survive for a few hundred million years. That research is now under way. In the meantime, scientists are preparing themselves to react as speedily as possible to the first signs that a nearby supernova has begun. Crucially, these first signals will not come flashes of light but will emerge from underground detectors designed to spot the universe’s most insignificant entity, the neutrino. “Neutrinos are the first thing that will emerge from a supernova,” says Smartt. “They are so insubstantial, they are very difficult to detect and instruments have to be put in places where they do not pick up spurious signals from other sources. “However, if enough are detected, then an automated alert will be sent out and the arrays of telescopes that we use to study the night sky will be turned towards the sources of those neutrinos. Then we will be ready to study the first bursts of radiation and light emerging from the supernova and to watch how it unfolds.” While scientists are confident a supernova will occur in 2022, whether it occurs in our galaxy is a different matter. In any given year, it is an unlikely prospect. On the other hand, one day it may just happen in our galactic neighbourhood. If it does, astronomers say they will be ready.",News/Science,Catch a failing star: the tense wait for a supernova ,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/01/catch-a-failing-star-the-tense-wait-for-a-supernova
5/1/2022,"Britain right now smells like sex. As you stand outside the post office, looking through your bag for a mask, you are bathed in the smell of fornication. As you take your aunt Elsie for a quick stroll to the hairdressers, the air drips with coitus. While lining up outside nursery to pick up your child, your nose is full of the smell of bonking. The sweet, vaguely piscine, sometimes acrid smell of shagging is hanging heavy everywhere – and we seem determined to ignore it. At least, most of us. While poems are written about the nodding heads of daffodils, and Instagram stories are awash with swaying oceans of bluebells, most people seem rather less inclined to admit that – to paraphrase that famous Mitchell and Webb sketch – every park in England smells like semen. That walking your dog is, for a few weeks in May, the nasal equivalent of squelching through a bordello. It is quite an impressive act of dissociation to be standing beside, say, a hawthorn bush at the No 3 bus stop, as a sexually active adult, and not immediately turn to the person beside you to say, “Wow, this pavement really smells like fucking!” And yet we do. You might notice the odd quivering nostril, catch a conspiratorial smile, but you’re unlikely to meet a stranger who acknowledges that the air beyond their chin smells like nookie. It isn’t necessary to study for a degree in botany to understand the reason for this aromatic assault. Just as birdsong is the auditory result of a few million horny creatures standing on a branch after a long and lonely winter, screeching “I neeeeeed to get laaaaiiiid”, so the sticky, tannic smells of May’s various blooms are the floral world’s attempt to attract pollinators. The country is ripening and plants have a small seasonal window in which to get fertilised, produce seeds and ensure their future survival. Like a hopeful 17-year-old slathering themselves in Lynx Africa in the hope that they’ll get served, and get lucky, they produce a chemical compound, or pheromone, that signals to the natural world that they are open for business. We, as members of the natural world, are attuned to this frequency, just as we are aware of the smell of rain (petrichor), the sound of rain or the heavy closeness of an approaching thunderstorm. What I find most striking about this time of year isn’t just the presence of conjugal smells in totally unexpected places, but the variety. On a single run through, say, your local nature reserve or patch of woodland, you might snort up the ammonia tang of sweet chestnut, the glossy sweetness of gorse, the ferrous – almost menstrual – smell of nettles, the spicy sickliness of linden trees, the fishiness of hawthorn or the semen whiff of ornamental pear. It’s libidinous out there. Some of this is due to triethylamine – a natty little chemical released by hawthorn flowers that is also one of the first chemicals produced by a dead human body when it begins to decay. Sex and death, just hanging there in the air outside Lidl; no wonder studies have indicated that men produce more sperm in spring – we’re being aromatically ordered to get to it while we still can at every turn. Britain may be considered a buttoned-up country, where we cast ne’er a clout (never take off our clothes) til May is out (the hawthorn is in bloom), but that’s not for want of trying on nature’s part. While the phrase “the sap is rising” might make me queasy, it’s hard to deny that, from the smallest mitochondria to the tallest tree, something’s thrusting up out there. As spring blooms, the subliminal signs are all around us, even if they’re tucked behind a bottle dump, masked by petrol fumes or crushed beneath asphalt.

5/1/2022,"They were one of television’s most popular couples, and now they’re getting back together, especially for you – or at least for viewers of Neighbours. Scott and Charlene, played by Jason Donovan and Kylie Minogue, will return after more than 30 years for the show’s finale. Jason Herbison, executive producer of the Australian soap, said the pair were “the ultimate Neighbours couple and it would not feel right to end the show without them”. “We are thrilled that Jason and Kylie have come home to play a very special part in our series finale. It has been an emotional experience for them, for us, and I’m sure it will be for our viewers.” Minogue and Donovan both posted a photo of what appeared to be a glimpse of a Neighbours script on their Instagram accounts. The pair will both return to the show, which first aired in 1985 and centres on the fictional cul-de-sac community of Ramsay Street in Melbourne, before it ceases production in June after being dropped by its broadcaster. Minogue and Donovan, who are both 53, played Scott Robinson and Charlene Mitchell until their departures in 1989 and 1988 respectively. The pair were Ramsay Street’s power couple and a favourite with viewers. Their wedding episode was watched by more than 2 million Australian viewers when it first aired in 1987, and later pulled in an audience of almost 20 million when it was shown in the UK in 1988, becoming one of the most-watched TV moments of the decade. The announcement has delighted fans of the show in the UK and Australia. “This means so much!” one viewer wrote. “Not taking away from the amazing current cast of course, but to have the iconic Scott and Charlene return for the ending is absolutely icing on the cake!” After it was announced that the soap would stop production, Minogue said she would “be forever grateful for the experience and the friends I made on Neighbours. “We had no idea how big the show would become and how passionately viewers would take it to heart.” Donovan said he thought the news was sad, adding: “I think it’s time to celebrate Neighbours.” “It has kept my family employed for a long time, to be honest,” he said. “My daughter is currently in it, my dad was in it. I think we should be grateful for what it’s given Australia, it’s given actors, producers, writers, directors.” Along with Minogue and Donovan, the soap has helped launch the careers of Hollywood stars such as Margot Robbie and Liam Hemsworth. In March the soap announced that “following the loss of our key broadcast partner in the UK and despite an extensive search for alternative funding, we simply have no option but to rest the show”. “We are so sorry to say that after nearly 37 years and almost 9,000 episodes broadcast we have to confirm that Neighbours will cease production in June,” a statement read. “To our amazing, loyal fans, we know this is a huge disappointment, as it is to all of us on the team. We thank you for all your messages and support and promise to end the show on an incredible high. From here on, we are celebrating Neighbours.”",Arts/Television & radio,Jason Donovan and Kylie Minogue reunite for Neighbours finale,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/01/jason-donovan-and-kylie-minogue-reunite-for-neighbours-finale
5/1/2022,"New York Jets: Due to a slew of perplexing selections over the years, the New York Jets are often expected to fail on draft night. But on day one of this year’s draft, the Jets put the league on notice by selecting cornerback Ahmad “Sauce” Gardner (No 4), wide receiver Garrett Wilson (No 10), and defensive end Jermaine Johnson II (No 26). A shutdown specialist who did not give up a single touchdown while at the University of Cincinnati, Gardner has the length, speed, skill, and confidence to make life difficult for opposing wide receivers. In addition to Gardner, the Jets added a superior pass rusher in Johnson by trading three picks to the Tennessee Titans. Both players should do wonders for a team that finished as the NFL’s worst defense in 2021. On offense, the Jets walked away with arguably the best wide receiver in this year’s draft in Wilson. A crafty route-runner with good hands and separation speed, Wilson should help the maturation process of second-year quarterback, Zach Wilson. Even the most critical Jets fans should be pleased by their team’s productivity in this year’s draft. Philadelphia Eagles: Following a season where they tip-toed into the playoffs only to get demolished in the first round by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Eagles approached this year’s draft with more aggression than any other team in the league. On day one, the Eagles pulled off a shocker by acquiring the speedy receiver AJ Brown from the Tennessee Titans in exchange for picks No 18 and 101. Brown, who will line up with promising receiver DeVonta Smith, could give the Eagles two of the scariest downfield threats in the NFC. The Eagles also added key players on defense by drafting two elite athletes from the University of Georgia’s national championship-winning team: defensive tackle Jordan Davis (No 13) and linebacker Nakobe Dean (No 83). Davis is a massive (6ft 6in, 340lb) run-stopper who is also swift enough to carry the ball as a running back on offense. A winner of the prestigious Butkus Award for the best linebacker in college football, Dean has an innate ability to read opposing offensive schemes and serve as the quarterback of the defense. The addition of center Cam Jurgens (No 51) allows the Eagles to develop a valuable offensive lineman under the tutelage of veteran Jason Kelce. The Eagles continued to be assertive in the later rounds by trading up to select linebacker Kyron Johnson (No 181). The Eagles are on the rise and added multiple players who will solidify their future while also snagging an elite receiver who should make the team a playoff contender from the weak NFC East in 2022. Baltimore Ravens: The 2021 season ended in disappointment for the Ravens who missed the playoffs after losing their final six games. With the No 14 pick, they selected safety Kyle Hamilton, who could be the team’s best player at that position since the retirement of Hall of Famer Ed Reed. Similar to Reed, Hamilton has the instincts to make the big play in pass coverage, or at the line of scrimmage. With the selection of Tyler Linderbaum (No 25), the team added the best center of this year’s draft to their offensive line. Ravens’ second-round selection, David Ojabo (No 45), could miss the entire season due to an achilles tear, but he may end up being the steal of this year’s draft if he lives up to the pre-injury projections, which classified him as a top-15 pick. Defensive tackle Travis Jones (No 76) was another impressive late-round pick with the skills of a first-rounder. Jones (6ft 4in, 325lb) will bring much-needed youth to the Ravens’ aging defensive line. Arizona Cardinals: In what initially appears like an attempt to appease unsettled star quarterback Kyler Murray, the Cardinals traded pick No 23 to the Ravens for Murray’s former college teammate Marquise “Hollywood” Brown and pick No 100. Although Brown’s 2021 campaign featured career highs in receiving yards and catches, he’s not yet considered to be a standout in his peer group of receivers. The Cardinals may have overvalued the return in this deal with the hopes of keeping Murray happy. With the No 55 pick, the Cardinals selected tight end Trey McBride. McBride, the first tight end selected, is sturdy and sure-handed, but he lacks the athleticism to break tackles and escape defenders. The additions of defensive end Cameron Thomas (No 87) and linebacker Myjai Sanders (No 100) could add depth to the Cardinals’ defense. New England Patriots: It may be unfair to prematurely judge the New England Patriots due to the team’s history of finding diamonds in the draft. However, the Patriots’ first-round selection of offensive lineman Cole Strange (No 29) was the most puzzling pick of this year’s draft. Strange, a lineman from the small University of Tennessee-Chattanooga who did not allow a sack during his college career, was projected by multiple draft experts to be selected in the third round. Arguably, there were better players at every position than Strange at No 29. But Bill Belichick has a proud record of going against the grain only to be proven right years later. The Rams' reaction to the Pats taking Cole Strange is incredible 😂(via @AndrewSiciliano)pic.twitter.com/YYzhRGiNeX With pick No 50, the Patriots drafted another player, wide receiver Tyquan Thornton, who was initially projected to be selected in a later round. Thornton’s draft stock increased significantly after an impressive showing at the NFL Combine. Both players can add to Belichick’s legacy of finding greatness in unconventional picks. Or, they can become another blemish similar to the 2019 draft when the Patriots selected N’Keal Harry over Deebo Samuel and AJ Brown.

5/1/2022,"Joe Manchin has recorded an ad for a Republican in a West Virginia US House election, in which the Democratic senator trumpets his opposition to Joe Biden’s Build Back Better domestic spending plan. “David McKinley has always opposed reckless spending because it doesn’t make sense for West Virginia,” Manchin said. Build Back Better was the centrepiece of Biden’s agenda, a $1.75tn package meant to boost health and social care and combat the climate crisis. Biden needed Manchin’s vote to get it through a Senate split 50-50 and controlled via the vice-president, Kamala Harris. After lengthy negotiations Manchin sank the plan dramatically, using an interview with Fox News Sunday to say he was a “no”. The White House responded angrily. Manchin’s stances on Build Back Better and issues including voting rights protections have since made him a boogeyman among progressives. In a new book, This Will Not Pass, two New York Times reporters describe meetings in which Senate Republicans sought to persuade Manchin to switch parties and thereby hand them control of the chamber. In response, Manchin said: “I am who I am, I’m a West Virginia Democrat.” A former governor and the only Democrat in major elected office in the state, Manchin has now released a 30-second ad in support of McKinley, who because of redistricting is challenging another sitting Republican, Alex Mooney, in a 10 May primary. In the ad, Manchin says: “I’ve always said, ‘If I can’t go home and explain it, I can’t vote for it. And that is why I opposed Build Back Better. For Alex Mooney and his out-of-state supporters to suggest David McKinley supported Build Back Better is an outright lie.” Many observers have said Build Back Better would have benefited West Virginians, who live in one of the poorest states in the union, prey to the fossil fuel industry in which Manchin prospered. Manchin has suggested parts of the plan could win his support. No visible progress has been made. In the ad, Manchin also says: “Alex Mooney has proven he’s all about Alex Mooney. But West Virginians know David McKinley is all about us.” Mooney – who counts among his roles in Washington co-chairmanship of the bipartisan Congressional Rugby Caucus – tackled the ad on Twitter. It was, he said, “further proof that David McKinley is a complete and total RINO”, meaning “Republican in Name Only”. Mooney also pointed to a Biden domestic policy success, writing: “Joe Manchin and David McKinley both supported Joe Biden’s $1.2tn non-infrastructure bill. “They also supported the sham January 6 witch hunt investigation against Donald Trump and his allies. Manchin even voted for Trump’s impeachment.” All 50 Democratic senators and seven Republicans voted to convict Trump in his second Senate trial, for inciting the deadly Capitol attack. Trump was acquitted and remains free to run for office. His endorsements are highly prized. He has backed Mooney. Mooney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. McKinley did not immediately comment. A spokesman for Manchin told the Hill: “The ad speaks for itself.”",News/US news,Democratic senator Joe Manchin cuts ad for West Virginia Republican,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/01/joe-manchin-democrat-ad-west-virginia-republican-david-mckinley-alex-mooney-trump-build-back-better
