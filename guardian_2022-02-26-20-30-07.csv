2/26/2022,"In recent years, words and ideas used to describe discrimination against members of historically marginalized and disadvantaged groups have seemingly exploded into the lexicon: systemic inequality, privilege, white supremacy, the patriarchy, etc. In some senses, the apparent novelty is deceiving: most of these concepts have been around for decades in academic and activist circles. None of these ideas are genuinely new. Nonetheless, our new study published in Social Science Computer Review demonstrates that a substantial shift in discourse has occurred – at least in the US media. And it may have important social and political implications. Analyzing 27m news articles published in 47 popular news media outlets between 1970 and 2019, we find that there was a rapid uptick in the use of words related to prejudice and discrimination beginning in the early 2010s. These shifts occurred in left- and right-leaning media alike. Moreover, the changes are not limited to print media. Using data from the Stanford Cable TV News Analyzer, we found that the major shifts observed in print media seem to have been mirrored in television news coverage as well. Just as striking as the magnitude of the shifts is when they occurred. The attitudinal and discursive changes don’t seem to be a response to anything in particular. For instance, given that the shifts became increasingly pronounced in 2012, one might assume they are straightforwardly a response to the killing of Trayvon Martin. However, it is harder to explain why we see similar changes in discussion and public attitudes with respect to sexism, homophobia, transphobia, Islamophobia and antisemitism – all at roughly the same time as we observe the spikes related to race. The shifts with respect to sexism and misogyny, for instance, were not a response to #MeToo. They preceded the emergence of #MeToo by a few years, and may help explain why the movement was able to achieve the impact it did – why it was able to find such a receptive audience when previous efforts to elevate the issues of sexual violence, harassment and discrimination were less able to gain traction. Indeed, there may also have been some deeper antecedent shift that helps explain why the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Michael Brown resonated so strongly when other comparable incidents of violence against African Americans (including other incidents caught on film) did not, and which may also explain why #MeToo and other social justice movements were able to gain such strong traction during this period as well. One possible explanation: these movements occurred in the context of already-heightened concern and preoccupation with bias and discrimination among the literati. Beginning in 2012 there was a rapid and dramatic shift in expressed beliefs regarding race, gender, and sexuality, which Vox’s Matt Yglesias popularly described as “The Great Awokening”. Critically, this transformation was most acute among the Americans who happen to be the primary producers and consumers of journalistic content. Contemporary US media workers tend to hail from a very particular segment of the population. They tend to be urban dwelling and politically liberal. They tend to come from relatively wealthy backgrounds. They tend to be highly educated, and those who work at flagship outlets tend to hail from prestigious schools and programs. Reporters skew disproportionately white and male relative to the communities they are embedded in. Summarizing the primary producers and consumers of journalism in the US today, the media scholar Nikki Usher aptly described the current state of affairs as News for the Rich, White and Blue. It may be that this rapid shift in attitudes among news producers and their primary audiences is what ended up driving the rapid changes in media discourse – setting the stage for social justice movements to “break through” into the mainstream in a way that they might not have been able to prior. However, while the attitudinal shifts with respect to prejudice and discrimination may have begun among a specific subset of the population, they did not end up confined there. Broader shifts in perceptions of prejudice and discrimination seemed to follow shifts in media discourse. It was not just the media discourse that has changed since the early 2010s – public opinion has shifted dramatically too. For most types of prejudice and discrimination (with the notable exception of homophobia), Americans grew far more likely to claim that identity-based bias and unfair treatment are widespread in the US as compared to polling from the turn of the century. What’s more, our data suggest that it is changes in media coverage that seem to predict shifts in public perceptions around race and gender discrimination – not the other way around. While we cannot definitively establish causation between media coverage patterns and changes in public attitudes, our findings are compatible with the possibility that the former affected the latter. And insofar as this coverage influenced public opinion, at the margins it may have also altered the course of American politics. The shifts in media discourse and public perceptions about identity-based prejudice and discrimination predate Trump’s 2016 presidential run. In other words, it was not a response to Trump. Instead, Trump seems to have emerged on the political scene in the context of already-heightened news media discussion about prejudice and discrimination, and public concern with the same. Both trends continued to accelerate over the course of Trump’s stay in the White House and, indeed, have continued unabated since his ouster. With this in mind, many subsequent social and political developments become a bit more comprehensible: Previous quantitative analyses have shown that there was an unprecedented focus on Trump in print media, television news and academia alike. This coverage was overwhelmingly negative, and focused heavily on his purported sexism, racism, Islamophobia and xenophobia – attributes assumed to be shared by his supporters, and that were purported to be key to his political success. Yet under Trump’s tenure at the helm of the party, Republicans consistently lost ground with white people. The attrition was most pronounced among white people who were relatively well-off and highly educated; again – who are among the primary consumers of news media in the United States. What’s more, there is evidence that these disaffected white voters were alienated from the Republican party precisely as a result of Trump’s racialized rhetoric and policies. Overwhelming negative depictions of Trump in news media might have exacerbated this trend. That is, prior to and over the course of Trump’s presidency, media discussion of prejudice and discrimination increased significantly. The public grew increasingly concerned with identity-based mistreatment as well – particularly key subsets of white voters. This increased awareness and sensitivity around bias and discrimination – including among key Republican blocs – may have led many white people who previously (if begrudgingly) supported Trump to turn against the former president and his party in 2018 and 2020. Trump and his opponents seem to have been united in their belief that the former president’s racialized policies and rhetoric were key to his electoral success. Our data may provide important context for why Trump instead met his political demise in 2020. Despite consistent Republican gains among many ethnic and religious minority populations over the course of Trump’s candidacy and presidency, losses among key white constituencies proved fatal for his electoral prospects. Changes in media discourse around prejudice and discrimination seemed to both reflect and exacerbate the underlying attitudinal shifts among whites that may have led to this outcome.

2/26/2022,"Britain’s armed forces minister has pledged that the UK will do everything it can to help Ukraine but warned that the months ahead will be “bloody” and “brutal”. James Heappey said on Saturday that he feared Vladimir Putin had “backed himself into a corner” and gone “all in” on Russia’s attack on Ukraine. “Nobody should think that this is anywhere near over. What stands in front of Ukraine, its armed forces and, very tragically, its people is days, weeks, months more of what we have seen over that last 48 hours,” he told BBC Breakfast. “President Putin, if you listen to his speeches, look at his press conferences over the last two or three days, there has been a fanaticism in the language that he used, a fervour in the tone of his voice. He has gone all in on this. I am afraid that that means that what is in front of Ukraine is bloody, brutal.” He said the UK would do “everything we can” to help Ukrainians resist, but added that it would be “a long slog”. “We are going to see some horrendous things on our TV screens,” he said. In another interview, Heappey said the UK and other western allies would support Ukraine “in every way we reasonably can” but that there would be “utterly brutal fighting” ahead. “He has put a huge proportion of the Russian armed forces into this campaign in Ukraine and I am very concerned that he has backed himself into a corner,” he told ITV. Heappey praised the “incredible” Ukrainian resistance and said that as a result fighting in Kyiv had so far been confined to “very isolated pockets of Russian special forces and paratroopers”. So far, he said, Ukrainian resistance was thwarting the Russian plan to take the Ukrainian capital, and Russian forces were “nowhere near running to schedule”. He told Sky News: “I think that will be a great cause of concern for President Putin and rather points to the fact that there was a lot of hubris in the Russian plan and that he may be awfully advised.” He said the UK was looking to continue to supply weapons to Ukrainian armed forces and that on Friday some of the 25 nations that took part in a donors conference chaired by the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, pledged to send arms and other aid. “We know what the Ukrainians want. We are doing our best to get it to them,” he told Sky News. He also said the government was working on plans to support a resistance movement and a Ukrainian government in exile if Kyiv falls, but that it would be a decision for the National Security Council. Heappey said the UK was continuing to push for Russia to be excluded from the Swift international banking payment system, which he said would be the “ultimate economic sanction”, but more diplomacy would be needed to reach an international agreement. “Swift is not a unilateral decision that the UK can take,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “That really is the ultimate economic sanction. It is the one that the UK government wants to see enacted. It is just clear that there is more diplomacy required before that is going to happen.”",News/Politics,"Ukraine faces ‘bloody, brutal’ months ahead, warns UK armed forces minister",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/ukraine-faces-bloody-brutal-months-ahead-warns-uk-armed-forces-minister
2/26/2022,"The Los Angeles district attorney’s handling of a sexual assault case and decision to backtrack on part of his reform agenda has caused political division and media outrage, in a case that signals the intensifying opposition to progressive prosecutors across the US. George Gascón, who leads the largest local prosecutor’s office in the nation, had banned the practice of charging youth as adults at the start of his term in 2020. But over the weekend, in response to outrage over a sexual assault case, he announced he would shift his policy so that juveniles could be tried as adults “in the most extraordinary of cases”. The controversy stems from the prosecution of 26-year-old Hannah Tubbs who was 17 in 2014 when she physically and sexually assaulted a 10-year-old girl in a Los Angeles county restaurant bathroom. Tubbs was charged in 2021 after she was arrested in Idaho and her DNA linked her to the assault. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years in juvenile hall. Last week, however, Fox News obtained jail recordings in which Tubbs said she “lucked out” with a juvenile sentence and made disparaging and disturbing comments about the victim. The Tubbs case and its backlash come as progressive DAs across the US face mounting pressure from police, prosecutors, rightwing groups, media commentators, politicians and some communities to abandon reforms and restore harsher punishments amid rising gun violence and homicide rates. There’s an ongoing recall effort against the San Francisco DA, who has fought against mass incarceration and police misconduct. In New York, the DA reversed some of his policies meant to reduce incarceration – just one month in office. Experts and advocates say the LA case highlighted the precarious nature of even modest reforms and how media coverage of individual horrific crimes can derail criminal justice reform. In a surprise statement on Sunday, Gascón said he would have handled the case differently had he known about the recordings and announced that he was now implementing a “different pathway for outlier cases”. A panel of “trusted advisors” would consider prosecuting youth as adults in extraordinary cases. Another committee could also consider whether to seek life without parole for some adult defendants, backtracking on his ban on sentencing people to die in prison. Shifting policies was a “really difficult decision”, Gascón told The Guardian. He noted how other countries keep youth out of the adult criminal system and have better results: “It is very clear to me the harm that we’ve done for years in prosecuting juveniles as adults,” Gascón said. He acknowledged the audio obtained by Fox News prompted him to shift his thinking. Gascón, who won office on promises of ending harsh punishments and prioritizing racial justice, also argued that the current juvenile system in California could not adequately handle a case as complex as Tubbs, who has faced charges in other counties, but “never received any services”. He emphasized that it would be “very rare” for his office to try youth as adults: “I will not allow this to be something that happens regularly.” The shift has not appeased Gascón’s critics, with the furor over his policies only growing. The majority of rank-and-file prosecutors voted Tuesday to support a campaign to recall him from office. Liz Braunstein, an attorney for Tubbs, said the leak of audio violated confidentiality rules in juvenile cases and the judge’s orders. “Hannah was a teenager when this happened. Most of the children that we see in delinquency court have experienced multiple traumas and adverse life experiences,” Braunstein said. “Our collective goal should be rehabilitation, which will improve the lives of that young person and also offer a greater degree of public safety.” The victim released a statement after the sentencing that described the assault as “beyond horrible” and criticized Gascón for his handling of the case. “Not only do I have to live with that awful memory for the rest of my life, but I’m also given no true justice as to what happened to me.” An uptick in gun violence and killings during the pandemic has caused significant concern in communities across the US, even though the current crime rate is significantly lower than decades prior. District attorneys have faced widespread scrutiny in media coverage of individual cases of violence. At times, they’ve been criticized for issues they have very little control over such as worsening homelessness crisis and mental health challenges. The critics of more liberal DAs have argued that these problems warrant a tough response. But champions of reform note studies have shown that harsher punishments do not prevent or deter crime and instead can lead to worse public safety outcomes while also disproportionately hurting Black and brown communities. They also note that in some cases, progressive DAs have been blamed for high-profile incidents of violence in cases where there was no indication that the offenses had any ties to specific DA decisions or policies. “As a country, we tend to make decisions that are reactionary based on one or two high-profile incidents, instead of following the evidence and research on what is most effective and equitable,” said Kristin Henning, a Georgetown Law professor and author of The Rage of Innocence: How America Criminalizes Black Youth. She added Tubbs’ prosecution was “an unfortunate case” to be at the center of a debate on prosecuting children as adults because of its complexities. It was similar reports of rising crime in the late 80s and 90s that led to the racist “superpredator” myth, which was the basis for laws that made it easier to transfer youth to adult prisons, Henning noted. In New York, for example, a crime spree by a 15-year-old in 1978 led to a new state law allowing children as young as 13 to be tried as adults. Henning added that there was now much more research about adolescent development and the harms of imprisoning youth, as well as momentum for racial justice reforms after George Floyd’s murder. Kami Chavis, law professor and director of the criminal justice program at Wake Forest University, lamented that reforms and crime prevention were often framed as opposing forces: “There is a real danger that the electorate is going to conflate progressive criminal justice policies with a rise in crime.” Gascón himself said he concerned that “the rightwing narrative is permeating very effectively into the mainstream of our community, even to some progressive members”, adding, “People are running scared, because they’re hearing the same things over and over.” He said there were rises in crime in jurisdictions with conservative DAs, which demonstrated “the whole concept of simply locking people up doesn’t work … if it did, most places would be extremely safe.” In Los Angeles, Gascón’s handling of the Tubbs case and subsequent policy shift has angered people on all sides, said Anthony Robles, campaigns coordinator with Youth Justice Coalition, who is part of a group working to end youth incarceration in LA county. “I don’t think anybody is happy … The people who really want a transformed justice system – he’s reneging on us,” Robles said. “It’s shocking and disappointing.” Frankie Guzman, an attorney at the National Center for Youth Law, who served on Gascón’s transition team, noted that California has come a long way in the last decade. In 2020, 25 youth total across the state were transferred to the adult system, compared to 1,200 youth in 2008. He said he was confident Gascón would not let transfers become the norm: “I understand that he’s dealing with politics and a broken juvenile justice system … so he has to respond in a way that will allow him to stay in the job to continue to do the good work even if it means softening his blanket policy.” James King, with the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, said the policy shift was a reminder of the limits of DA reforms: “There’s really no such thing as a ‘progressive prosecutor’. By their very nature, they are charged with using the carceral system to solve trauma and harm in our society.”",News/US news,How a single case challenged the LA prosecutor’s reform agenda: ‘Nobody is happy’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/26/los-angeles-california-prosecutor-reform-agenda-roll-over
2/26/2022,"The footballer Troy Deeney, who still receives regular racist abuse and who has three children in the UK education system, has called for Black experiences to be properly taught in class. It’s an issue I’ve long campaigned for. Back in 2020, during the height of the Black Lives Matter protests, petitions were sent to the then education secretary, Gavin Williamson, for the national curriculum in England to include examples of Black history. The petition set up by my organisation, The Black Curriculum, gained more than 200,000 signatures. But these calls went largely ignored. The government said there were already enough examples of Black history in the national curriculum, and that schools were free to teach what they want. Many schools at this time, which were seeking guidance around how to teach Black history, contacted us. It was particularly clear to us that many teachers lacked confidence in how officials within their education department would respond. This is why Deeney’s latest calls are vital, and why the new education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, must treat this as a priority. Sadly, the teaching of Black history has been caught up in culture-war politics, with MPs and ministers wrongly claiming it means “cancelling” historically significant white figures. In October 2020, the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, told parliament: “The government does not want children being taught about white privilege and their inherited racial guilt.” Shortly afterwards, Liz Truss, then also an equalities minister, said of her schooldays: “While we were taught about racism and sexism, there was too little time spent making sure everyone could read and write.” But Black history should be a mission for all of us, whatever our politics, because to truly “level up” our society requires a rich, full-spectrum educational experience for all students. The benefits of inclusive teaching that acknowledges the impact of Black people across all subjects are tangible and long term for all students – for Black pupils, of course, but also for every child whose only knowledge of Black history is enslavement. This is about building a sense of identity and belonging, bringing in all young people and fostering social cohesion all year round – not just in Black History Month. By fostering greater understanding, empathy and knowledge, we are less likely to have negative perceptions that can have damaging consequences – such as the lowering of grades, exclusions, racist incidents and other systemic society issues. Deeney himself commissioned a YouGov poll, which showed that only 12% of teachers across primary and secondary schools in England feel empowered to teach optional topics around Black history. These topics – including colonialism, migration and identity – cannot be taught without the necessary guidance and accompanying material. If these are lacking, then children are being failed, and the survey found that. Most teachers (64%) felt they were not provided with enough ongoing training and personal development in this area. During 2021 alone, my organisation provided 6,000 teachers across the country with training in Black history: it is imperative that teachers are supported and don’t fear they’ll be put in compromising situations by teaching this subject. Yet recent government intervention in relation to Brighton and Hove’s anti-racist training – where the council was accused of telling schools to teach white privilege and inherited racial guilt to children – discourages schools from teaching history in a more accurate and truthful way. Teachers in our training sessions have revealed how they fear being accused of breaking the equalities law for simply teaching Black history. In a modern, multicultural country this cannot be right. Deeney, who we’ve been only too happy to work with over the past few months, has now stepped up his campaign to change the national curriculum. Following the adoption of an inclusive curriculum in Wales, we want to see England’s curriculum shaped around reality, we want teachers in all areas of the country, whether in primary or secondary, to have Black histories embedded in their teaching. Deeney is more than a footballer with a cause: he represents a key shift in British education. Our schools system is just a microcosm of wider society, and we now have an opportunity to make a permanent change by teaching the stories of all our people.

2/26/2022,"During her first year in the England’s Lane homeless hostel in north London, Queeny Singh barely left her room. She didn’t speak to her family, or the other residents. “I was embarrassed,” says the mother of three from south London. It was 2018. Singh had just been made redundant from her job as a deputy manager at the clothing chain Dorothy Perkins. She couldn’t find another job that would accommodate childcare. Singh fell behind on her rent, and lost her home. She moved into England’s Lane with her baby daughter Anyah and was also pregnant with son Zavier. England’s Lane is a large redbrick building originally used as a home for NHS nurses. In 2004, it was converted by the council into a hostel for around 160 homeless families. Although the accommodation was meant to be temporary, the shortage of social housing in the area meant that some families were stuck in England’s Lane for years. For Singh, “It was like a prison. There was no play area for the children. I spent a whole year sitting in that little room.” People in the hostel didn’t mix. One afternoon, Singh was sitting on the hostel steps when she saw a mum struggling with her daughter. The child wanted McDonald’s, but the mother couldn’t afford it. Singh cooked the family a meal on a two-ring stove in her bedroom. “By the end of the week,” she says, “I was cooking for 50 families.” What changed, Singh says, “was that I stopped feeling sorry for myself. I realised there were people in worse situations than me. People in the hostel had fled domestic violence. They had no voice.” Singh became a trusted community figure, the person people would go to when they needed someone to speak to the council or schools on their behalf. “I became their support system,” she says. Singh persuaded the council to let her convert one of the empty rooms into a play area for the children. She spent her limited savings on cooking equipment, and turned her room into a makeshift restaurant. “When the mums finished work or got their kids from school,” she says, “they’d come to mine for pots of curry.” Women from different communities began to mix in her bedroom. She started a WhatsApp group connecting the mums of England’s Lane for friendship and mutual aid. England’s Lane was never suitable for long-term residence and the council began moving people out in 2020. That year, Singh moved into her uncle’s house in Camberwell: he has dementia, and she is his carer. “Crazy as it might sound,” she says, “I was sad to leave the hostel.” By the time it closed, she had 150 families on a WhatsApp group. “They pleaded with me not to close it down,” says Singh. “Then I started to extend it to other mums in north London.” Singh now manages the group, which has about 200 members. Many of them are single mothers, refugees, domestic violence survivors or people on very low incomes. Singh wrangles donations from businesses and crowdfunders, and offer items on a first-come, first-served basis, whether it’s cooking appliances, furniture or toys. “Most of these mums are in debt,” she says. “Things like beds, cookers, fridges are expensive.” “She’s like a spinning wheel,” says Marie Hall, a single mother in Singh’s group. “How someone with three young children manages to do what she does is incredible.” Singh recently helped source Hall a cooker. “But it’s not just that,” says Hall. “There have been times when I’ve been feeling down and she’s there after 10pm, listening to me on the phone.” Accessing support through mainstream charities often involves a lot of jumping through hoops, Singh says: “It can be a long process. Whereas with me, say someone gives me a fridge or a freezer, I can put it on the WhatsApp group, and it will be gone the next day.” She also organises events every few months to get the women socialising with each other. “The mums often don’t go out,” she says, “because they can’t afford it.” For her treat, Singh suggests some makeup. She always used to take care of her appearance when she worked in retail and she had plenty of cosmetics and clothes. But when she moved into the hostel, she gave almost everything away. “I used to do pampering days for the mums,” she says, “and I’d constantly be giving stuff. If I didn’t give it away, my kids would use it to paint with.” MAC cosmetics sends Singh a box of makeup, including lipstick, lip liner and mascara. “I’m always giving, so it’s nice to receive something for a change,” she laughs. “It’s a lovely little treat.” Want to nominate someone for Guardian angel?

2/26/2022,"Baking with herbs inspires curiosity and fascination. Although herbs aren’t strangers to most kitchens, they aren’t particularly associated with sweet bakes, despite bringing such interesting and unexpected flavour profiles. Infusing a few sprigs or leaves in a butter or syrup is an easy way to add flavour to your baking and gives many options for jazzing up old favourites. I’ve dedicated a chapter to baking with herbs and tea in my new book, and today’s recipes are from its pages. I love the gentle liquorice notes that tarragon brings to the blondies and the flecks of rosemary running through the scones add a warm, piney aroma that makes them feel a little fancy without doing too much. Scones are my go-to when I’m short on time. Relying on store-cupboard basics, you’re likely to have everything to hand already, allowing you to throw these together as soon the craving hits.

In a large bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Add the butter and toss in the flour to coat, then rub the mixture between your fingertips until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Stir in the chopped rosemary. In a jug, whisk the milk, egg and honey. Make a well in the centre of the flour mixture and pour in the liquid, using a knife to stir it in until the mix begins to clump together and forms a soft dough. Turn out on to a lightly floured surface and knead very gently and briefly, folding the dough back on itself a couple of times – the surface doesn’t need to be perfectly smooth, so try not to overwork it. Pat the dough into a thick, round disc and cut into eight wedges. Place the wedges on the lined baking sheets, leaving about 2½cm between them, then bake for 16–20 minutes, until golden and well risen. To make the glaze, gently heat the honey, water and rosemary sprigs in a small pan, then bring to a boil and boil for one minute. Brush directly over the warm scones, then serve with salted butter or clotted cream and an extra drizzle of honey.

2/26/2022,"Iam no stranger to credit card fraud: in the past I have had my card cloned and had the details stolen from a hack on a retailer. But I thought a card I had never used would be safe from the threat of crime. I was wrong. Even if you lock your credit card in a safe the moment it arrives, you can still fall victim to charges made by criminals. But how can criminals steal your card details if you’ve never even used them? At 10pm on a quiet Thursday night in January, I got a text from my bank, Halifax, saying my credit card had been used at Domino’s Pizza for an order costing £30.67. After 30 minutes on hold on an extremely busy Halifax line the customer service rep asked why I had called. “Fraud,” I said. “Domino’s?” he replied. Clearly, I wasn’t the only one paying for someone else’s takeaway. In fact, the UK appears to have been in the grip of a takeway fraud boom. Recently a colleague’s card details were used to order £300 worth of takeways in the Andover area all over a single weekend. This week, thousands of First Direct customers found their cards had been used to order chicken dinners in Nando’s. Mention to friends or family that your card was used by fraudsters to buy takeaways, and you will soon learn that you not alone. In my case, Halifax froze my card to prevent further charges, and the next morning the card was cancelled and the charges marked to be refunded. Three days later a replacement card arrived on the doormat. Having activated it, I stashed it safely in a drawer. The next day I checked my statement to make sure the pizzas had been refunded – only to find to my horror seven fresh fraudulent charges totalling £465 – all on my new card. These weren’t at Domino’s but an unfamiliar sportswear company in the Midlands. Given I had only activated the card 16 hours prior, hadn’t used it, entered the new number into Apple Pay or any other service, it hadn’t left the house and no one else had access to it, how on earth had someone already spent money on it? I am not the only person to have found myself asking this question recently – this week, the Guardian Money reader Phoebe Maddrell got in touch to say that her debit card details had been used for fraudulent transactions even though she had never used it – either online or in person. In my case, Halifax’s fraud investigations team said I had fallen victim to what is called a “guess attack”, where an organised criminal gang work out the card number and the expiry date. They didn’t need to have stolen the card number in a hack or physical theft, and were able to use it as soon as it was activated. Looking at a bank card’s 16-digit card number and four-digit expiry date, you might be forgiven for thinking that the combination would be too complex to simply guess. Unfortunately, it is very much not the case. “The first thing to realise is that you are not guessing the full 16 numbers at random,” says Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity adviser at Eset. “The first six digits of a credit card number signify the card network and the issuing bank, while the final digit is the Luhn algorithm checksum.” That means they only have to guess seven numbers, while that final Luhn digit helps verify whether the rest of the card number is valid. The checksum was originally designed to help spot manual input errors, such as mistyped numbers or transposed sequences, but it can also be used by criminals to verify a number could be real. “There are websites out there that have Luhn verifiers which help find these numbers in little or no time at all, making the chances of locating a card in use relatively high,” Moore says. Once a criminal gang has a potentially valid credit card number it can then try it out to see if it is in use. The card verification value (CVV) – the three digits usually printed on the back of the card in or next to the signature strip – helps prevent this kind of attack by adding further burden on the criminals. “There are, however, many websites – often located outside the UK – that will accept card payments without any need for a three-digit CVV number or any other proof of identity,” Moore says. Banks and card companies have sophisticated technologies in place to spot and prevent these sorts of attacks from happening in real time using certain characteristics of each transaction. Reports after the fact help refine the systems so they can stop more like it. Criminals typically target websites that handle large volumes of low-value transactions, which makes it more difficult to spot fraud from the hundreds of thousands of genuine purchases. Once an attack is identified additional checks are implemented to block it and prevent further similar frauds but some will pass through at first. In my case, Domino’s did request the CVV of the first card but that, too, was guessed, allowing two of the transactions through before further transactions were flagged by Halifax’s systems. Takeways appear to be targeted as they regularly process low-value purchases where the card is not present. Criminals use a card’s details to make a series of rapid purchases until the card is stopped. A Halifax spokesperson says: “Through our multilayered fraud detection systems, we never stop fighting to prevent fraud, blocking the vast majority that is attempted. Unfortunately, highly sophisticated criminal gangs also never stop trying to break our defences and some fraud does get through.” This case has certainly made me reconsider the number of bank cards I hold and why. With every account opened, another card arrives that could result in me being a victim of fraud even if I never use it. Credit card fraud cost the UK £574.2m in 2020, according to data from UK Finance, including £376.5m of e-commerce fraud. While banks refunded 98% of customers and prevented an additional £983m of fraud in the year, there is always a risk it could happen to you. Protecting yourself against a guess attack is difficult but there are things you can do to prevent the damage they cause. Never approve a transaction you weren’t expecting. Measures to comply with the new strong customer authentication regulations are being phased in before the March 2022 deadline. These will typically require customers to verify some transactions via a one-time passcode sent by SMS or banking app prompt for about one in four online transactions. Most card issuers allow you to freeze or temporarily deactivate all or parts of the card’s functions. These include blocking transactions outside the UK, online or over the phone, in person or contactless payments. Freezes do not stop recurring transactions, direct debits or transactions where the retailers do not ask the bank for verification, such as public transport. Report fraud to your bank immediately you spot it. Moore says: “I always advise people to check their bank statements regularly, even daily, to spot any discrepancies. If card details are stolen and slip through the net a small number of times, these cards become very valuable indeed and can be used multiple times, even for years on end, without raising suspicions.” Phoebe Maddrell from Herefordshire was one of thousands of First Direct’s customers hit by fraudulent spending at the fast food chain Nando’s. She received a message on the morning of 17 February querying a £42 payment from the debit card linked to her account. She saw it when she woke up, and responded to say she hadn’t made the payment. “I then logged into my internet banking and saw that there were multiple transactions via Apple that I didn’t recognise,” she says. “I started the account last June for saving. I’ve never taken the card out of the house; it’s never been used at a retailer.” Maddrell contacted the bank straight away and was told that the Nando’s transaction had been blocked, and that the card would be cancelled and the Apple payments not charged to her account. However, later that day the Apple payments went through. “I really am concerned that something strange is going on,” she says. “There is no way that the fraudsters could have obtained the card details from anywhere. Unless somehow these were breached when the card was sent to me in the post.” Maddrell’s bank would not shed any light on how the fraud had occurred, saying it could not do so for security reasons, but said there had not been a data breach. It says Maddrell will be repaid in full and will not need to speak to the fraud team. A First Direct spokesperson said: “We are aware of some low-value unauthorised retail transactions appearing on a small number of our customers’ cards. “We want to reassure impacted customers that they will not be left out of pocket and apologise for any inconvenience caused. “We take our customers’ security very seriously and will be reaching out to affected customers in the coming days. “We would advise customers to regularly check their statements and get in touch if they notice any suspicious activity.” Maddrell has complained to the Information Commissioner’s Office about her case, and to the financial ombudsman about First Direct’s unwillingness to explain how the fraud happened, and because she was unable to reach the fraud team at first and told there was a four-week wait for a callback.Hilary Osborne",Lifestyle/Money,Credit card fraud: ‘How could scammers use it before I did?’,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/26/credit-card-fraud-scammers-guess-attacks
