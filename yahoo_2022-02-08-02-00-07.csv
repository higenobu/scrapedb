2/8/2022,"A recent internal White House investigation found that President Biden's top science adviser and director the Office of Science and Technology Policy Eric Lander ""bullied and demeaned his subordinates and violated the White House's workplace policy,"" Politico reports per the investigation, as well as interviews with current and former staffers. The probe, conducted over a two-month period, found that Lander was ""bullying"" with his former general counsel, Rachel Wallace. It also concluded there was ""credible evidence"" of ""disrespectful interactions with staff by Dr. Lander and OSTP leadership"" — including moments where he spoke ""harshly and disrespectfully to colleagues in front of other colleagues,"" and to women ""in a demeaning or abrasive way in front of other staff."" Staff interviewed by Politico detailed a similar toxic work environment, ""where they say Lander frequently bullied, cut off and dismissed subordinates,"" Politico writes. Wallace, Lander's ex-general counsel, said the director ""retaliated against staff for speaking out and asking questions by calling them names, disparaging them, embarrassing them in front of their peers, laughing at them, shunning them, taking away their duties, and replacing them or driving them out of the agency. Numerous women have been left in tears, traumatized, and feeling vulnerable and isolated."" On Friday, reportedly once he became aware of Politico's forthcoming report, Lander apologized for his behavior in an email to staff. Still, some staff are wondering why he hasn't been more seriously punished, especially after Biden pledged to honor a zero-tolerance staff disrespect policy among his political appointees, Politico notes. ""Everyone is afraid of him,"" said one OSTP staffer of Lander. ""There are a lot of brilliant people in this country,"" said another. ""I completely reject the notion that his brilliance is so singular and critical to the nation that his behavior is excusable.""

2/8/2022,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican authorities on Sunday cleared a makeshift camp in the north of the country where hundreds of migrants heading towards the U.S. border had been holding out for more than a year in what rights organizations criticized as deplorable conditions. Nearly 400 migrants have been transferred by bus to three different shelters near the border city of Tijuana, where they can remain ""indefinitely,"" said the city's Mayor Montserrat Caballero. Caballero promised help for those migrants regardless of whether they want to stay in Tijuana or return to their countries of origin. ""We're going to pay for the transfers and, if they want to wait for their 'American dream,' we're also going to support them while they wait,"" said Caballero. Dozens of security personnel, including soldiers from the national guard, were seen dissolving the makeshift camp, fenced by metal mesh, in videos shared on social media. Families, including parents with small children, were seen packing up their belongings. There were no reports of violence. Caballero said the troops were not armed and that migrants collected their belongings and boarded buses voluntarily because they had previously been notified they would be transferred. But one Guatemalan mother, who had arrived in Tijuana a year ago, and requested anonymity, said she felt migrants had little choice but to follow orders. On Saturday, Mexico's National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) urged immigration authorities to speed up the processes that would help nearly 2,000 migrants at the southern border get documents to regularize their stay in Mexico or let them travel through the country without being detained. Tens of thousands of migrants flee their home countries each year in an attempt to reach the United States, but many of them also seek refuge and protection in Mexico.
