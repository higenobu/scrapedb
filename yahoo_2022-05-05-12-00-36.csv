5/5/2022,"Michael Saylor is perhaps one of the most fervent supporters of Bitcoin on the planet—and that’s saying something, given the almost cultlike community behind the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Saylor, an MIT graduate and the cofounder and CEO of the business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, has become a hero to the Bitcoin faithful ever since his company began stockpiling the cryptocurrency in August 2020. The CEO has gone so far as to call Bitcoin “freedom,” and “the most universally desirable property in space and time.” And at Bitcoin 2022 Miami—the largest Bitcoin event worldwide—Saylor was met by thousands of cheering fans as he instructed the crowd to never sell their crypto. Saylor’s Bitcoin appetite has grown so much that the CEO is now borrowing millions from banks to add more of the cryptocurrency to MicroStrategy’s balance sheet. The collateral? That’s right, more Bitcoin. MicroStrategy added another $215 million worth of Bitcoin at an average purchase price of $44,645 per coin in the first quarter, SEC filings show, bringing its total holdings to 129,218 Bitcoins acquired for $3.97 billion, or $30,700 per coin. At Bitcoin’s $39,800 price as of 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday, the company’s holdings were worth over $5.1 billion. The company’s market cap, on the other hand, is roughly $4 billion. MicroStrategy has said it has no plans to sell its Bitcoin, and thus far, its buy-and-hold strategy has been profitable. But with Bitcoin’s price down roughly 35% in the past six months, that may be changing. As a result of its status as a quasi-Bitcoin ETF, and a pile of over $2.3 billion in long-term debt, MicroStrategy’s stock is down over 20% in the past month and nearly 65% from its February 2021 all-time high of over $1,000 per share. And if Bitcoin’s value continues to fall, Saylor and company could face one hell of a margin call. MicroStrategy’s CFO Phong Le explained in the company’s first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday that if Bitcoin’s price falls below $21,000, or around 50% from current levels, it will be forced to pony up more cryptocurrency to back its $205 million Bitcoin-collateralized loan with Silvergate Bank that was used to buy Bitcoin in the first place. “We took out the loan at a 25% LTV; the margin call occurs at 50% LTV,” Le said. “So essentially, Bitcoin needs to cut in half, or around $21,000, before we’d have a margin call.” The CFO noted that MicroStrategy still holds “quite a bit” of uncollateralized Bitcoin that it could use to answer any potential margin call, however. “As you can see, we mentioned previously we have quite a bit of uncollateralized Bitcoin,” Le said. “So we have more that we could contribute in the case that we have a lot of downward volatility. But again, we're talking about $21,000 before we get to a point where there needs to be more margin or more collateral contributors. So I think we're in a pretty comfortable place where we are right now.” Still, taking out a loan collateralized by Bitcoin to buy more Bitcoin is a risky game. If the world’s leading cryptocurrency falls and a margin call goes through, MicroStrategy would be put in a tough spot. MicroStrategy did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.

5/5/2022,"In just a little over three weeks, Nvidia (NVDA) is due to report its Q1 2022 earnings. Perhaps in preparation for that big event, investment bank Morgan Stanley announced it is resuming coverage of the semiconductors giant -- and provided a few thoughts on the company ahead of earnings. ""Nvidia,"" writes Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore, ""remains one of the best growth names in the semis space [and] is a core holding."" For this reason, the analyst says Morgan Stanley's approach will be ""to at least maintain a market weighting in the stock, and look for spots for an overweight."" In other words, Moore appears to be saying here that under no circumstances would Morgan Stanley consider rating Nvidia a Sell. Moore notes that Nvidia has built ""a strong, differentiated cloud [artificial intelligence / machine learning] business and leading position in gaming."" That being said, the gaming business does pose some concerns. Near term gaming numbers look ""solid,"" says Moore, and over the long term as well, the analyst says he's bullish on Nvidia's ""prospects and market positioning."" However, he does predict a deceleration in gaming revenues ""that should result in a modestly challenging 2023"" -- helped only partially by Nvidia's strength in selling server chips to data centers. So much for the business. Now let's consider the stock price. Nvidia continues to grow both sales and earnings for now, but even so, ""earnings growth will likely be partially offset by multiple compression,"" especially as inflation and interest rates rise and investors become less willing to pay large price tags for earnings far in the future. This could prove a problem for Nvidia stock, which sells for ""a meaningful premium to everything else."" By Moore's calculation, Nvidia stock sells for 38 times current year earnings and 32 times forecasts for earnings in 2023. (Valued on trailing earnings, the stock has an even higher P/E of 48). Even the most generous measurement of earnings, therefore, would require Nvidia to achieve and maintain 32% long-term earnings growth to maintain a PEG ratio of 1.0 -- and 32% long-term growth could be problematic. In part it's because these multiples are already so high that ""the stock has traded sideways since the broader high-growth tech selloff that we saw to start the year."" But a second reason for Nvidia's failure to outperform of late is because the gaming business is expected to decelerate this year. As the pandemic winds down, government handouts dry up, and Americans head back to the office to work, there's going to be less time, and less money available to spend on gaming and on gaming hardware, depressing sales of the GPUs that have always been Nvidia's forte. Additionally, recent weakness in crypto prices is hurting demand for Nvidia GPUs that have been repurposed for cryptocurrency mining, putting at risk ""about $800 mm per quarter [in sales of graphics chips] across the industry."" With these concerns in mind, Moore assigns Nvidia an equal-weight (i.e. Hold) rating for now, and a $217 price target. By the analyst's own admission, however, ""equal-weight"" is about as low a rating as Morgan Stanley is prepared to ever assign Nvidia. (To watch Moore's track record, click here) The rest of the Street is more optimistic than Morgan Stanley. 21 Buys and 6 Holds have been issued in the last three months, making NVDA a Strong Buy. At $331.14, the average price target brings the upside potential to ~68%.
