5/14/2022,"A mom in Texas says her son and some classmates were forced to do “bear crawls” on a hot track after they tried to get out of running by hiding in the shade during a physical education class, according to local reports. The punishment burned the hands of the Anthony Aguirre Junior High students, according to KRIV. Mother Wendy Alvarez says her own 12-year-old child has second-degree burns, KPRC reported. “When I saw him, he had a big blister here, blisters forming on the palm,” she said, according to the Houston-based TV station. A spokesperson with the Channelview School District confirmed in a statement to McClatchy News that four students had received “non-life threatening heat related injuries due to the conditions outside.” The teacher accused of disciplining the students has been placed on administrative leave as the district investigates the allegations, according to the statement. Bear crawls — “a bodyweight mobility exercise” — involve putting your weight on your hands as toes as you move while crawling low to the ground. After Alvarez’s seventh grader completed the exercise during his P.E. class on Monday, May 9, she told KPRC that he described his hands as being on fire. Temperatures in the Houston area ranged from the low to mid 90s with heat indexes in the 100s. “To me, that’s torture,” Alvarez told KRIV of the gym class discipline. “I feel like the punishment was too harsh,” she told KPRC. “I’m all up for discipline, disciplining the kids, but not like that.” “Channelview ISD does not condone aversive discipline techniques that may cause physical pain to a student in any way. We take these situations very seriously as the safety of our students is always our top priority,” according to the statement. The school district is located in unincorporated Harris County, east of Houston.

5/14/2022,"FRESNO, Calif. (AP) — Police in central California were searching for the driver of a pickup truck that struck a woman walking her dog Friday and kept going, dragging her more than 8 miles (13 kilometers) to a hotel parking lot, where she was found dead. The 29-year-old woman was pushing a shopping cart and had her dog on a leash when she was hit by a gray or silver pickup truck at the intersection of Herndon and Millburn in Fresno, said Fresno Police Lt. Bill Dooley. The man kept driving with the woman trapped under his truck and stopped at a hotel, where he parked in the parking lot, got out of the pickup truck and went to the lobby to ask for a room, Dooley said. When the man was told there was no vacancy, he left and was pulling back in his truck when another hotel guest saw the woman's partial remains dislodge from under the pickup truck and called police, Dooley said. “This is an absolute tragedy,” he said. Dooley said the woman has been identified and was believed to be homeless but that her name won't be released at this time out of respect for her and her loved ones. Surveillance video captured the man arriving at the hotel in his heavily damaged truck, exiting his vehicle, and leaving shortly after. Dooley said the surveillance video from the hotel won’t be released. “I saw the video footage because everything was captured on surveillance footage. We’re not going to release this,” he said. “There’s nothing to gain by releasing this.” Police released frame grabs of the Chevy Silverado pickup truck with its front heavily damaged and of the man in the lobby of the hotel and asked anyone who recognizes him to contact the Fresno Police Department. During a news conference, Dooley asked the man to turn himself in and for his family or friends to contact authorities. “If the driver of that vehicle was watching today, we’re asking you to contact the police department. If family members or friends recognize this photograph, we’re asking you to contact the police department,” he said.",U.S./Associated Press,"Police: Man struck woman with truck, dragged body 8 miles",https://news.yahoo.com/police-man-struck-woman-truck-185741765.html
