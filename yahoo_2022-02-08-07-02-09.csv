2/8/2022,"Bitcoin became increasingly correlated with equities toward the end of the fourth quarter of last year and fell when faced with the prospect of central bank tightening, FSInsight said in a note entitled “Digital Assets in a Post-Cycle World.” The correlation has become more pronounced with bitcoin and the wider crypto market now being strongly correlated with technology stocks because of “legacy market capital entering the fold,” Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy, wrote in the note on Friday. However, bitcoin is still king, Farrell wrote, adding that the crypto could reach $200,000 in the second half of the year, following a choppy start to 2022. FSInsight also said that decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other Web 3 applications have driven massive growth of the Ethereum network. Ethereum is undervalued relative to cloud platforms, and ether, which is the native token of the network, could reach $12,000 in 2022, the report said. There is optimism surrounding Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake in 2022, which if it happens, would likely result in capital inflows irrespective of bitcoin performance, the note added. Bitcoin was trading at $42,750, and ether at $3,068 as of publication time. CORRECTION (Feb 7, 13:40 UTC): Corrects headline to say $200,000 not $20,000.

2/8/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Optimists expecting the stock market to weather the rate-hike cycle as they’ve done in the past are missing one important detail, according to Bank of America Corp.’s strategists.

U.S. and European stocks have made a rocky start to 2022 amid concerns that more aggressive monetary steps to tame inflation will hamper the recovery. While a positive earnings season is easing some worries over a less forgiving macroeconomic backdrop, equity markets have remained volatile, and strategists are divided about what lies ahead for the rest of the year. BofA’s team is squarely in the bears’ camp, expecting the U.S. benchmark to end the year at 4,600 points, implying just 2% upside from current levels. The strategists argue that the closest historical precedent to the present outlook is the monetary tightening at the turn of the century, which “ended poorly” for stocks with the bursting of the tech bubble. “The pivot from super dovish to more hawkish policy underscores that we are at the point of peak liquidity,” they said in the note on Monday. While other notable Wall Street voices, including Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson, share their pessimism, the assessment is by no means the consensus view. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s team reiterated on Monday that growth will remain solid this year and with still more upside for equities, following the ferocious rally of 2021. For BofA’s strategists, though, an abundance of red flags including valuations, sentiment, fundamentals and technical factors point to a poor year for equities. “Moreover, we believe that risks to equities would be greater if the Fed did nothing,” they wrote. “Runaway inflation would likely compress S&P 500 multiples and cut into earnings.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek The Nuclear Industry Argues Regulators Don’t Understand New Small Reactors The Rise of the $2.5 Billion Ugly-Shoe Empire New Airline Bets You’ll Stop in Alaska for a Cheaper Flight to Asia Nurses Who Faced Lawsuits for Quitting Are Fighting Back Merck’s Covid Pill Fumble Gives Pfizer Potential $17 Billion Win ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•6 hours ago,Bank of America Strategists Warn Fed Hikes in Pricey Market to End Poorly,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-america-strategists-warn-fed-162547371.html

2/8/2022,"It may take a hot minute or two before investors consolidate their emotional hangover from Meta's awful earnings day and begin to buy the dip in the tech giant's valuations. ""I think there are some dark days ahead for Facebook. You can change your name every month if you want. Their strategy is ultimately social media and digital advertising,"" said Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives on Yahoo Finance Live. It's almost hard to imagine a darker day for Meta than Feb. 3. Shares crashed 26% by the close of trading after a very disappointing fourth quarter and outlook. Facebook said it added just 2 million monthly active users in the quarter, barely moving the needle from the prior quarter. In the third quarter, the platform added 15 million monthly active users. Daily active users fell by 1 million as Facebook saw increased competition from TikTok. The company missed analyst profit estimates by a whopping 14 cents. For 2022, Facebook sees slowing growth and a $10 billion hit from privacy changes to Apple's iOS operating system. The stock's slide wiped away $251.3 billion in market value from Meta. It marked the biggest one-day loss in value for any U.S. company ever. Shares have continued to trend lower in the wake of the destruction. Adds Ives, ""[Facebook CEO] Mark Zuckerberg has an uphill battle to get back to growth."" Even Meta bulls such as long-time tech analyst Mark Mahaney are cautious on the stock price in the near-term.

2/8/2022,"Many people who need the tax refund money the most are looking at even more delays than usual this tax season. A variety of factors could push tax refunds well into March or later for early filers, even though the Internal Revenue Service officially began processing tax returns on Jan. 24. Tax professionals say federal income tax refund money typically won't arrive until two weeks or three weeks after a tax return is processed. At best, many early filers who had returns in the pipeline Jan. 24 would receive their money in the next week or two. The IRS noted that most tax filers who have no issues would receive their federal income tax refund within 21 days of when they file electronically, if they choose direct deposit. The IRS said that's similar to previous years. Last year's average tax refund was more than $2,800. Many taxpayers, though, need to be aware that everything once again isn't likely to move smoothly. There is no such thing as a simple tax season. TAXES 2022: When can you expect this year's refund? George Smith, a CPA with Andrews Hooper Pavlik in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, said he expects longer refund delays for some tax filers who face challenges relating to additional stimulus payments and advance child tax credit payments received in 2021. ""How long I cannot say, but based on 2020 tax returns processed I’m not optimistic for quick refund turnarounds,"" Smith said. Before you file – or buy now with plans to pay it off using refund cash – take time to consider what issues could hold up your income tax refund in 2022. Here are some factors: Do not underestimate how many problems will be caused this tax season as filers compare the total advance dollars received from July through December with the amount one still is eligible to claim on the 2021 return. The first step is to look at the total dollar amount listed on the IRS Letter 6419 or letters that were mailed to you. A married couple filing a joint return is to receive two letters. But you're also going to want to double check that information with your own records and information the IRS has online. The letter itself spells out two key components that you need for a 2021 tax return – the total amount received in 2021 and the number of qualifying children taken into account when determining the advance payments in 2021. DON'T TRASH THIS IRS LETTER: Why IRS Letter 6419 is critical to filing your 2021 taxes What's confusing: Some letters the IRS is sending are wrong, situations with divorced parents can get tricky, and the IRS has been issuing some confusing advice. All this means that you may not be able to file as early as you had hoped – or mistakes could trigger a manual review by the IRS that will delay your refund. And if you know anything about the real world, well, you don't need a tax expert to tell you that we're looking at a ton of headaches ahead for some parents. Just because a couple is divorced, that doesn't mean they stop fighting about money. Right now, the IRS said only a limited number of letters appear to contain the wrong total for the dollars received in 2021. The issues apparently involve taxpayers who moved or changed bank accounts in December and now are seeing discrepancies with the information on their latest correspondence with the IRS on Letter 6419. DON'T TRASH THIS IRS LETTER: Why Letter 6419 is critical to filing your taxes The IRS noted the letter might have been generated in those cases before money may have been received by the taxpayer. You want to file an accurate and complete return, so you don't want to file until you absolutely know your numbers relating to the child tax credit are correct. Don't guess and hope the IRS will fix it. Amber Gray-Fenner, an enrolled agent at the Tax Therapy firm in Albuquerque, New Mexico, said the IRS often refers tax filers to the Child Tax Credit Portal for information. But if you go to the portal, the IRS states: ""Do not use the Child Tax Credit Update Portal for tax filing information. To complete your 2021 tax return, use the information in your online account. You can also refer to Letter 6419."" A new update from the IRS indicates that you can have an advance child tax credit payment traced by the IRS if you did not receive it. 2022 TAX TIPS: How to get child tax credit cash, charitable deductions and free help But Gray-Fenner notes it might take several weeks to get such information from the IRS, creating more frustration for taxpayers. ""If it is determined the payment was not received or was returned to the IRS,"" according to the IRS posting, ""IRS records will be updated, and you can exclude the payment from the aggregate amount of advance child tax credit payments you report on your tax return. This will allow you to claim, if eligible, the missing payment with your child tax credit on your 2021 return."" SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER: The Daily Money delivers our top personal finance stories to your inbox Taxpayers in this situation would be urged to contact the IRS as soon as possible from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. local time at 800-908-4184. When you call, be prepared to give specific information about the missing payment: the payment date, method, status, and amount that is displayed in your ""Child Tax Credit Update Portal."" When it comes to trying to trace a missing payment, that effort could hold up things as the taxpayer may not be able to clarify the issue quickly with the phone number that the IRS is providing, according to Mark Luscombe, principal analyst for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting in Riverwoods, Illinois. ""I would not hazard a guess as to how long that might take to resolve this year,"" Luscombe said. READY TO FILE YOUR RETURN?  Here's what you need to know Antonio Brown, a CPA in Flint, warns of potential headaches for parents who are divorced and then alternate claiming their child or children from one year to the next, as part of divorce agreement. ""Whoever claimed the child on the 2020 tax return would have received the advance payment unless they opted out,"" Brown said. Say one divorced parent, who is not entitled to claim the child on the 2021 return received the advance monthly payments in 2021. (The IRS used information on 2020 or 2019 tax returns, what was available, to issue those advance payments that began in 2021.) Luscombe said the parent who claimed the child in 2020 would be required to repay the advance money when filing a tax return for the credit received last year with the 2021 return in many cases unless they were protected by safe harbor rules. If you received the advance payments – but you can't claim the child on the 2021 return – you need to reconcile and pay back the IRS what's owed. The IRS says divorced parents in this situation could have gone online earlier in 2021 to opt out from receiving monthly payments using the child tax credit update portal at IRS.gov. If the divorced parent didn't opt out – or had trouble opting out using the IRS system, as some did – there will be issues. Now, what about the parent in this example who claims the child on the 2021 return? That ex-spouse will be able to claim the full amount of the child tax credit for the child, according to the IRS, even if the other parent received advance child tax credit payments last year. While the other parent should have opted out from receiving advance payments, the IRS maintains that ""their decision will not affect your ability to claim the child tax credit."" DON'T FORGET: Jobless benefits are taxable on 2021 tax returns For some filers, Brown said, it can be almost punitive if you didn’t opt out of the advance credit. There are some safe harbors that limit how much some might have to pay back. You only would qualify for full repayment protection, for example, if your modified adjusted gross income is at or below $40,000 in 2021 if you're a single filer or you are married and filing a separate return. For the head of household, the income needs to be at or below $50,000. And for married couples filing jointly, the income would need to be at or below $60,000. And if you make more money, you might qualify for some protection but even that goes away if your modified adjusted gross income is at $120,000 if you are married and filing a joint return or $80,000 if you are a single filer or are married and filing a separate return. The threshold is $100,000 if you're filing as head of household. ""Assuming that both spouses handle this in the correct way, there may be no holdup in processing or refunds,"" Luscombe said. ""The IRS is unlikely to be aware of the divorce agreement, but as long as only one parent claims the child each year, the processing should not be held up,"" he said. But if both ex-spouses claim all or part of the child tax credit for the child in 2021, Luscombe said, the IRS probably will flag the returns and that could hold up processing and refunds. Gray-Fenner said the advance child tax credit can prove to be quite confusing. Some letters that divorced couples are receiving could also be wrong, she said, adding to the confusion. And many may not realize that some people will have to pay back money received in 2021. ""If you got more than you are entitled to and don't qualify for the income-based safe harbor you are going to have to pay it back,"" Gray-Fenner said. Early birds who e-filed a federal income tax return on Jan. 24 or shortly after aren't going to see their refund money until mid-February or later if their return included a claim for the Earned Income Tax Credit or Additional Child Tax Credit. The IRS, by law, cannot issue those refunds with these credits before Feb. 15. Congress gave the IRS additional time to help the IRS stop the growth of fraudulent returns that tried to wrongly cash in on big refunds generated by these credits. The law was enacted in 2015. People who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit can expect to see tax refunds in bank accounts or their debit cards by the first week of March, according to IRS alerts. #IRS expects the earliest #EITC and ACTC tax refunds to be available in bank accounts or debit cards by the first week of March.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., and Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., introduced a bill to ""undo tax refund delays for recipients of the Earned Income Tax Credit who file their taxes early."" The bill would allow the IRS to issue many refunds to roll out earlier if the amount on the tax return can be matched and verified with information on W-2 forms, which are issued by Jan. 31.

2/8/2022,"Feb 7 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc plans to more than double its base pay cap to $350,000, from its previous maximum salary of $160,000 for U.S. employees, according to a company memo.

""This past year has seen a particularly competitive labor market,"" according to the memo, which added that there was a ""need to remain competitive for attracting and retaining top talent"". Last year, Amazon increased its average starting wage for operations staff in the United States to more than $18 an hour, against the backdrop of a tight U.S. labor market.

2/8/2022,"Hello friends, and welcome back to Week in Review! Last week, we talked about the ""de-stonkifying"" of the market. This week, we're looking at a wounded Facebook/Meta that finds itself backed into a corner. If someone forwarded you this message, you can get this in your inbox from the newsletter page, and follow my tweets @lucasmtny. Image Credits: Facebook Meta had a bad week -- like history-making rough. The Facebook parent company saw its stock price get bludgeoned after a bad earnings report showcased that Apple's ad-blocking changes are shaving billions off its books and the company's crown jewel -- the Facebook platform -- has stopped growing and actually shrank this quarter. The company's stock tanked by more than 26%, representing a $230 billion reduction in market cap and a $31 billion drop in Zuckerberg's personal net worth. Plenty of analysts shared that this was the biggest dollar amount single-day drop for a company's market cap ever. The company's rough turn of luck couldn't be happening at a worse time; as Facebook looks to pivot the broader company toward the ""metaverse,"" they also shared that they spent nearly $10 billion on the effort -- and don't expect to recoup that money any time soon. While Meta is managing to ship more and more Quest headsets, there anecdotally hasn't seemed to be much interest in the company's Horizon Worlds platform, and there are few shortcuts toward finding an audience on an unproven hardware platform. The AR/VR world is increasingly proving to be a tough place to do business. Apple has delayed its own headset again and again. This week, Insider reported on the struggles that Microsoft was enduring in its HoloLens division, sharing that the company was scrapping plans for a third-generation headset amid a lack of clarity in its path toward becoming a player in the untapped consumer AR space. Meanwhile, engineers got a look at the next-generation of Magic Leap's hardware. This writeup from industry analyst Karl Guttag showcases how Magic Leap has turned away from several of the key technologies it raised billions of dollars to develop with its latest hardware, which he nevertheless believes will ""blow away"" the HoloLens 2 in image quality. The point is, this stuff is hard, and the people who have been building in public are hurting even as they spend billions to develop the tech. There's no straightforward road for Meta to follow; they have to blaze a trail where others are actively failing and keep the rest of their company together while they do so. VR already a polished platform and could self-sustain I’m sure, would imagine bulk of the $10B is AR which is probably 7-10 years worth of iteration from being a revenue generator which is only an easy investor sell when your position in market is entirely secure. — Lucas Matney (@lucasmtny) February 6, 2022 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Image Credits: TechCrunch Here are a few stories this week I think you should take a closer look at: Snap has one hell of a week While Meta's week was downright awful, Snap had a strange reversal of fortunes that saw its stock plummet and then dramatically rebound hours later. The double-digit drop actually came from Meta's earnings report, which investors feared would be indicative of a broader revenue slump across social media stocks. When Snap actually showcased a healthy bottom line it its earning release, the stock shot back up, gaining nearly 60% Friday. Apple launches its first local newsletter Apple's pivot to services has been a mixed bag, and the company is looking to expand the appeal of its Apple News service to a wider swath of free and paid subscribers. This week, the company rolled out a local newsletter in the San Francisco Bay Area, bringing bundled local news curated by the Apple team. ""If Apple chooses to roll out more daily local newsletters, it will have several markets to choose from. Today, Apple News offers local news coverage in 11 markets, including San Francisco, the Bay Area, New York, Houston, Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento, Miami, Charlotte, San Antonio and Washington, D.C.,"" my colleague Aisha notes. Crypto startups are making it easier to build crypto clubs I've been writing quite a bit about crypto lately, and this week I dug into a particularly interesting facet of the industry called DAOs. The groups essentially allow a number of anonymous and pseudonymous users to collectively make decisions and function like mini crypto-backed governments. I talked to a handful of stakeholders in the space who see a bright and broad future for the collectives. “The fact that a DAO is just software that can can be spun up with the click of a button… but can catalyze thousands or tens of thousands of people — eventually we expect millions of people or larger numbers — that all put together capital and put together ideas to work together for some common goal… we see that as almost the purest vision of what web3 and crypto are all about,” a16z GP Ali Yahya told TechCrunch in an interview.

2/8/2022,"Cryptocurrencies have had an especially volatile past month, but an influential market analysis company is predicting gigantic gains in the coming months. FSInsight, in a note to investors, said Bitcoin could hit $200,000 in the second half of 2022. That’s a 462% increase from the crypto’s price as of Monday morning. Ethereum is also set for potentially huge gains, said FSInsight, with a prediction of a price as high as $12,000 this year, a 385% premium to where it is trading now. The report noted that cryptocurrencies are increasingly becoming connected to tech stocks. Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy, said this was due to the “legacy market capital entering the fold.” Last year, the crypto industry saw venture capitalists invest $30 billion into tokens and blockchain companies. Major corporations also boosted their holdings significantly. “This is much different from 2018 where tech stocks were still doing well but Bitcoin sold off along with the rest of the crypto market cap,” said Farrell. To meet the $200,000 target, Bitcoin would need to attract another wave of investors, as it did last year—something Farrell says he sees a “reasonable chance” of happening. It would also require the market to rebound in the second half, but prices are already notably higher than the Jan. 24 low (though well short of its all-time high). Meanwhile, growth in NFTs, Web3 applications, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications has resulted in significant growth for the Ethereum network, which makes it “remarkably undervalued” says Farrell. Bullish predictions on Bitcoin have been made before, of course, and the most optimistic have rarely proved accurate, but FSInsight and Farrell say they are still among the faithful, as long as the government doesn’t get in the way. “All assets can sell off and drop another 50% if the Fed hikes 4% tomorrow or next month,” he said. “But right now, as things stand, the upside to both Bitcoin and ETH is much larger than the downside.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Business/Fortune•7 hours ago,"Bitcoin will hit $200,000 in the second half of 2022, predicts FSInsight",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-hit-200-000-second-152309529.html
