5/21/2022,"Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, has disclosed that the UK has begun discussions with its international allies about sending modern weaponry to Moldova to protect it from Russia. She said that she wants to see the country, which is to the south-west of Ukraine, “equipped to Nato standard.” Moldova is not currently a Nato member and there are concerns that it could be a future target for Vladimir Putin after the Ukraine conflict. In an interview with the Telegraph, Truss said: “I would want to see Moldova equipped to Nato standard. This is a discussion we’re having with our allies. “Putin has been absolutely clear about his ambitions to create a greater Russia – and just because his attempts to take Kyiv weren’t successful it doesn’t mean he’s abandoned those ambitions.” The UK, US, France and Germany have held talks about whether to sign a form of security guarantee for Ukraine to continue providing weaponry and support in the long term. Truss added: “What we’re working on at the moment is a joint commission with Ukraine and Poland on upgrading Ukrainian defences to Nato standard. So we will scope out what that looks like, what the Ukrainians need. The question then is how do you maintain that over time? “How do we ensure … that Ukraine is permanently able to defend itself and how do we guarantee that happens? That’s what we are working on at the moment. “And that also applies to other vulnerable states such as Moldova. Because again, the threat is broader from Russia, we also need to make sure that they are equipped to Nato standards.” Truss has been criticised in some quarters after announcing earlier this week that the government was planning to table legislation that would nullify parts of the Northern Ireland protocol by exempting some goods moving between Great Britain and Ireland from EU customs checks. The US House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, warned on Thursday that unilateral UK legislation affecting the protocol could endanger British prospects for a free trade deal with the US. Pelosi said she viewed the protocol as essential to maintaining the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement which minimised border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Meanwhile, João Vale de Almeida, the EU ambassador to the UK, rejected the demand that the agreement be rewritten and argued that little had changed in the past 18 months since the government was threatening to pass the internal markets bill. However, Truss defended her stance, telling the Telegraph: “What we know is the situation in Northern Ireland is worsening. So the time has come where we have to be resolute, we have to be clear that we are moving ahead to legislate for these solutions.”",News/UK news,UK and allies discuss arming Moldova with ‘Nato standard’ weapons,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/20/uk-and-allies-discuss-arming-moldova-with-nato-standard-weapons
5/21/2022,"Arnaud Desplechin has once again wheeled his bizarre sweet trolley into the Cannes restaurant: another clotted confection of tragi-romantic-comic gibberish. Desplechin is a Cannes fixture and his weirdly indulgent jeux d’esprit certainly give the competition a flavour of sorts. But this is exasperatingly nonsensical and humourless: it is full of grand gestures, gigantically self-important acting, big scenes (though often bafflingly truncated), big emotions and smirkingly knowing dialogue. Yet I admit there is technique and gusto to the way it is put together. The story is about a brother and sister who hate each other. And why exactly? Well, it’s not entirely clear, and if the point is that sibling tension often isn’t explicable – well, that idea also isn’t clear. Marion Cotillard is Alice, a hugely famous stage star who is performing in an adaptation of James Joyce’s The Dead. Her brother Louis (Melvil Poupaud) is a celebrated author who is insufferably conceited in ways Desplechin presumably did not intend. There is a third sibling, who hardly features, and Alice has a husband and a child from whom she seems weirdly detached. Louis and Alice’s relationship has been poisoned by a gnawing envy of each other’s success. It came to a head when he apparently wrote a tell-all family memoir for which she sued him (this vital fact is thrown away in an almost subliminal fragment of dialogue). And when Louis got married to Faunia (Golshifteh Farahani) and had a child, Alice never even spoke to them. Then Louis’s child dies – a tragic event that seems all but forgotten in the maelstrom of pouty acting – and Alice’s ashen-faced appearance at the wake only exacerbates Louis’s hatred. He writes another hurtful memoir, but brother and sister may yet be brought together by a tragedy – yes, another tragedy – involving their elderly parents. There isn’t a single convincing moment in all the airily sophisticated dialogue. When Louis meets Faunia for the first time, it is in a restaurant: Louis is drunk and Alice, who is seated near him, makes a shocking emotional scene and crashes out of the room. But Faunia, like no human being you have ever met, continues to make knowing remarks. Is she supposed to be sociopathic? When Louis and Alice finally meet in a café for a big showdown, Desplechin simply cuts off the scene before anything important is said. Later, a highly emotional Louis gets out on to the roof, apparently about to throw himself from the edge. And then … the scene cuts to some other bit of nonsensical piffle, without us seeing how Louis was presumably talked back from the brink. Desplechin’s overwrought whimsy and fantasy has worked in the past, but increasingly his movies look like a two-hour perfume commercial: Insouciance, for men and women.  Brother and Sister screened at the Cannes film festival.",Arts/Film,Brother and Sister review – sibling battle with Marion Cotillard that leaves us all losers,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/20/brother-and-sister-review-cannes-2022-arnaud-desplechin
5/21/2022,"The world No 91 Aaron Wise enjoyed a lucky escape from serious injury after being struck on the head by a wayward tee shot during the second round of the US PGA Championship. Wise was bending down to assess the lie of his ball in rough at the 7th hole at Southern Hills as Cameron Smith, playing the adjacent 2nd, cracked a drive in his direction. Wind strength back towards Smith meant Wise did not hear a clear shout of ‘Fore.’ Smith’s ball struck Wise on the right side of his head, which left a mark on his hat and left the 25-year-old applying an ice pack for a lengthy period after the end of his round. He had applied a cold water battle to the injury at the time of the incident. “I was surprised my ball wasn’t in the fairway and the next thing you know, there’s a little bit of ringing in my head and I was down on the fairway,” Wise told the Golf Channel. “Obviously, there’s a lot of adrenaline in the body after something like that happens. So it’s really just trying to calm myself down and get back to feeling somewhat normal for the last few holes.” Wise added that he felt “fine” but a “little sore.” Joel Dahmen, playing alongside Wise, described the incident as “a glancing blow.” Dahmen added: “All the spectators heard it. It was loud. He was definitely shaken getting into that next shot, for sure.” To Wise’s immense credit, he saved par at the 7th. His second round of 72 left him seven from the halfway lead held by Justin Thomas at six-under par. It has been reported that a television reporter was struck in the face by a ball during round one, which left the individual in question requiring hospital treatment. Neither the PGA of America nor the tournament’s host broadcaster has commented.",Sport/Sport,Aaron Wise escapes serious injury after ball strikes him on head,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/20/aaron-wise-escapes-serious-injury-after-ball-strikes-him-on-head
5/21/2022,"Antonio Conte has said Tottenham’s Champions League push will not be derailed by a sickness bug as he closes in on an achievement he suggested was nothing more than fantasy when he took over at the start of November. The club’s supporters were given a nightmarish flashback on Friday lunchtime when Gary Lineker revealed he had heard “there’s a food poisoning outbreak at Spurs”. Numerous players at the club had fallen ill on the eve of the final-day decider at West Ham in 2006 – in the notorious Lasagna-gate episode – when they needed to win to secure a top four finish ahead of Arsenal. They lost and Arsenal pipped them to the position. This time, Conte’s team must avoid defeat at Norwich to ensure they qualify ahead of Arsenal, who face Everton at home. Harry Kane did not train on Friday because of a stomach bug but Conte stressed that the striker would be fine. The virus had affected four players before last Sunday’s home win over Burnley – Hugo Lloris, Pierluigi Gollini, Harry Winks and Dejan Kulusevski – although they were fit enough to be in the squad. Lloris started and Kulusevski came on as a substitute. One other unnamed player missed training earlier in the week but Conte said he had returned. “In my mind, it is not a problem,” Conte said, as the club stressed it was not food poisoning. “We are ready to fight and get a good result. For sure, Harry [Kane] will be OK. The availability of the players is the same as against Burnley. It [the bug] is a problem that lasts one or two days and then you are OK.” Spurs were eighth when Conte replaced Nuno Espírito Santo, and the outlook was bleak. Daniel Levy, the chairman, did not set any targets for Conte beyond telling him to improve the situation. “If he had asked me: ‘I want to go to the Champions League’ … at that moment, to be realistic, I can tell him only one thing: ‘Are you joking?’” Conte said. The manager is determined to see the job through, having been pleased with the development of his players, especially mentally. “In this aspect we have improved a lot,” he said. “I don’t forget my first game against Vitesse [a whirlwind 3-2 win with 10 men]. I said: ‘I don’t want to go crazy with this type of situation, the team showing not to be stable. It was really emotional but in a bad way. From that, we worked a lot.” Conte will sit down to discuss his vision for the summer transfer window at some point after Norwich, with fears swirling that the hierarchy may not be able to match his ambition. “I have a really good relationship with Daniel, with Fabio [Paratici, the managing director of football],” Conte said. “They know very well that I will try to do everything for the best for the club. I enjoyed a lot and I am enjoying a lot to work in this club. Now the most important thing is to try to get this result [at Norwich] and then we will find the right solution for everybody. “I repeat – I am happy and I want to tell thanks for the opportunity to work with this group of players and with this modern club, with these fans, with this atmosphere.”",Sport/Football,Bug fails to upset ‘happy’ Conte as Tottenham aim to bag fourth spot,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/20/bug-fails-to-upset-happy-conte-as-tottenham-aim-to-bag-fourth-spot
