1/12/2022,"There's good news about this Omicron phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and bad news, but much of it is based on educated guesses and the good and bad often blur together. One bit of good news, The Associated Press reports, is that ""scientists are seeing signals that COVID-19's alarming omicron wave may have peaked in Britain and is about to do the same in the U.S., at which point cases may start dropping off dramatically."" ""It's going to come down as fast as it went up,"" says Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington, whose influential model predicts that daily cases will peak at 1.2 million by Jan. 19 then start plummeting, he says, ""simply because everybody who could be infected will be infected."" ""I think it's hard to process what's actually happening right now,"" acting FDA commissioner Janet Woodcock told a Senate panel on Tuesday, ""which is most people are going to get COVID."" People should try to avoid infection, but as a society the priority right now should be to ""make sure the hospitals can still function"" and protect ""other essential services as this variant sweeps through the population,"" she added. ""I don't think that will last a really long time."" Where we are now, The Wall Street Journal reports, is record-high averages of COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations, but significantly below-peak ICU occupancy and deaths. ""There are still a lot of people who will get infected as we descend the slope on the backside,"" Lauren Ancel Meyers, whose University of Texas COVID-19 Modeling Consortium predicts reported cases will peak within the week, tells AP. ""At the end of this wave, far more people will have been infected by some variant of COVID,"" she added, but ""Omicron may be that point where we transition from what is a catastrophic global threat to something that's a much more manageable disease."" Or, Ancel Meyers says, a variant worse than Omicron could strike next. ""As Americans push into a third winter of viral discontent,"" The Washington Post reports, ""a strange unity of confusion is emerging, a common inability to decipher conflicting advice and clashing guidelines coming from government, science, health, media, and other institutions."" For example, the Post says, ""in liberal and conservative media alike, countervailing voices alternately raise and dash hopes that the pandemic endgame is nigh."" And many Americans are tuning out the muddled messages and managing the best they can.

1/12/2022,"The former president has heavily endorsed the COVID-19 vaccine in recent weeks. In an OAN interview this week, he reiterated his stance and said he got no side effects from his booster. He also criticized politicians who were being vague about their booster-shot status. Former President Donald Trump endorsed COVID-19 vaccines again and blasted ""gutless"" politicians who won't say if they've been boosted. In an interview with the far-right One America News network, Trump said he was pro-vaccination and that he experienced ""absolutely no side effects"" after receiving his booster shot. The interview was pre-recorded at the former president's Mar-A-Lago resort in Florida on Monday and aired on OAN on Tuesday night. Trump also slammed politicians who had been vague about whether they had received their COVID-19 booster shots. ""Many politicians — I watched a couple of politicians be interviewed and one of the questions was, 'Did you get the booster?' because they had the vaccine — and they're answering it like ... 'yes' but they don't want to say it. Because they're gutless,"" Trump told the OAN presenter Dan Ball. ""You gotta say it, whether you had it or not. Say it. But the fact is that I think the vaccines saved tens of millions throughout the world."" Watch part of the interview here: Trump did not name the politicians who he said were not disclosing their vaccination status. But Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Trump ally and possible 2024 contender, was criticized last month for giving an unclear answer as to whether or not he had been boosted. When asked by Fox News, DeSantis responded: ""So, I've done whatever I did ... The normal shot, and that at the end of the day is people's individual decisions about what they want to do."" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has also given mixed messages. After Abbott tested positive for COVID-19 in August, NBC News reported that Abbott had told people that he received a booster shot, but his spokesperson told The Texas Tribune she wasn't ""aware of any booster."" As of Tuesday, just over 36% of the US population has received COVID-19 booster shots, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two-thirds of the population received two doses of the vaccine, the CDC data said. Much of Trump's base is anti-vaccination. Last month, Trump told his supporters not to boo after revealing at a live interview that he had received a booster shot.

1/12/2022,"Dr. Anthony Fauci made headlines on Tuesday for firing back at two of his Republican critics during a no-holds-barred session on Capitol Hill. And “The Late Show” host Stephen Colbert loved every minute of it. “In usual fashion, senator, you are distorting everything about me,” Fauci told Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), then pointed out that the lawmaker often uses attacks on him as fundraising ploys. Or, as Colbert translated: “I have your results, senator, and I regret to inform you, you’ve contracted my boot in your ass.” Fauci, one of the nation’s leading infectious diseases experts, also sparred with Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), who demanded that Fauci make his financial disclosures public. But as Fauci noted, those disclosures have been public for decades, as is required by law. “Our office cannot find them,” Marshall said. When Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) called on the next senator, a hot mic picked up Fauci’s uncensored thoughts about Marshall. “What a moron,” Fauci could be heard saying. “Jesus Christ.” Both Colbert and his audience were here for it: “And now that clip lives forever on the Internet,” Colbert said. “The one place where Sen. Marshall and his staff will never be able to find it.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.
