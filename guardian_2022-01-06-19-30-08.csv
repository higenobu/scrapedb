1/6/2022,"Maybe Romain Saïss can no longer be described as underrated after his manager at Wolves, Bruno Lage, proclaimed him to be “the Moroccan Maldini” but the 31-year-old still tends not to get a mention in discussions of the Premier League’s most reliable and inspirational defenders despite his continued excellence this season. His quality has long been recognised in Morocco, whom he has captained since 2020 and hopes to lead on a more triumphant campaign than their disappointing past two appearances in the Cup of Nations. They will certainly not be allowed to ease their way into the 2022 edition, since they face Ghana in the first group game. While Saïss drives his team on from the rear, assisted by the wonderful Paris Saint-Germain full-back Achraf Hakimi, Morocco are likely to look to Ryan Mmaee to make the difference for them up front. The 24-year-forward, who plays for Ferencvaros, has made a thrilling impact since declaring for Morocco last year, his speed and dribbling helping him to score four goals – and create another four – in four matches. Born in Belgium to a Moroccan mother, he – and his brother Samy, who could partner Saïss in central defence – will be aiming for glory in Cameroon, the birthplace of their father. That would be a lovely family story, and also help vindicate the decision of the manager, Vahid Halilhodzic, to leave out Chelsea’s Hakim Ziyech for a perceived lack of commitment.  Djamel Belmadi was a hot-head as a player but his serene leadership since becoming his country’s manager in 2018 is the chief reason why Algeria are the favourites to win the tournament and retain the crown they claimed in 2019. The manager has brought order where they had been disarray, finding a way to turn an array of gifted individuals into a powerful collective. There is much more to Algeria than Riyad Mahrez. Milan’s Ismaël Bennacer, voted player of the last tournament, is not as spectacular as the Manchester City magician but is a dynamic, clever and constant influence in midfield, where Saïd Benrahma can also be expected to create regular problems for opponents – and chances for Youcef Belaïli, the striker who is seeking a new club after being let go last month by his Qatari employers a day after, coincidentally, scoring for Algeria to knock Qatar out of the Arab Cup. This striker is not defined by the past. He was a youth international for France and he was a flop for West Ham. Now, with Ajax, he is top scorer in the Dutch league and he set a record this season by scoring 10 goals in the Champions League group stage, more than any individual has previously managed. He hopes to take that form into the Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast, whose attack he has been leading since scoring on his debut in November 2020. In addition to one of European football’s most in-form strikers, the Elephants boast, with Franck Kessié and Ibrahim Sangaré, one of the strongest central midfields at this tournament. They could seriously complicate things for Algeria, whom they meet in the group stage and maybe later, too. The midfielder, who turns 19 this month, has made only one senior appearance for Manchester United, a fact that Ralf Ragnick has suggested he hopes to change after Hannibal Mejbri returns from his latest international adventure. He impressed at last month’s Arab Cup, where he helped Tunisia to finish as runners-up. There he demonstrated not just his technical finesse but also his personality, as he fended off occasional attempts to rough him up and took plenty of creative initiative. Reaching the final in Cameroon will be much harder but with Mejbri helping Wahbi Khazri to add ingenuity to a well-drilled side, Tunisia could go far. Steven Caulker’s first appearance for England, in 2012, is not easy to forget: the defender scored by heading in a free-kick from Steven Gerrard, who was making his 100th appearance, but that was rather overshadowed by four goals from one of the forwards he was tasked with subduing, Zlatan Ibrahimovic (although Caulker was on the pitch for only one of them). That was all in a friendly, however, and since Caulker did not appear again for England, he is free to celebrate his roots by representing Sierra Leone, the country where his paternal grandfather was born. When he makes his competitive debut at the Cup of Nations, it will be a moment to savour for the 30-year-old, who has overcome mental illness to continue to enjoy his career. The former Liverpool and Tottenham defender plays for Gaziantep in Turkey, on loan from Fenerbahce. Sierra Leone are underdogs in a difficult group but making it to the tournament is a commendable achievement for the country and for Caulker. Nigeria’s spluttering performances over the past year led to the dismissal of Gernot Rohr, who had been the country’s longest-serving manager until being jettisoned last month. The preparations of the interim coach, Augustine Eguavoen, have been hampered by the loss of key forwards: not just the brilliant Victor Osimhen but also Emmanuel Dennis and possibly Odion Ighalo, whose Saudi club, Al Shabab, are hoping to retain him on similar grounds to those that enabled Watford to keep hold of Dennis. All of which is likely to increase the pressure on Kelechi Iheanacho to provide goals. He can expect high-class assistance from the wonderful winger Samuel Chukwueze but also from central areas if Eguavoen’s plan to deploy the CSKA Moscow wideman Chidera Ejuke as a No 10 pays off. Ejuke’s extravagant skills and impressive speed make him a delight when on song and suggest he could run the Super Eagles’ show, which starts with a blockbuster against Egypt.",Sport/Football,From Bennacer to Haller: Africa Cup of Nations players to watch ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/06/africa-cup-of-nations-players-to-watch-saiss-bennacer-haller-mejbri-caulker-ejuke
1/6/2022,"At the temple of regret, you can have your mistakes burned away by a smiling practitioner, if you are willing to pay a hefty fee. I’m at an unremarkable office block near Monument tube station in central London, watching the remorseful have their body art erased at Pulse Light Clinic, which offers state-of-the-art tattoo removal using laser technology. As penitents of all ages, walks of life and ethnicities walk through the door, one thing becomes clear: there are a lot of terrible tattoos out there. In a spotless treatment room beside a £6,500 tattoo-removing PicoSure laser machine, senior practitioner Cherry Brierly is recounting her clients’ stories. “I had one lovely guy,” she says brightly. “He had a tattoo on his head. He was in his 60s, newly divorced. He came in and said: ‘It’s not me any more. I need to find a new wife.’” The tattoo said: “Made in London”. It disappeared in a single session.  Probably the worst tattoos Brierly has removed were the terrible jokes: “‘Tupac’ written across the stomach,” she says. “Or ‘Brexit’ on the bum. Or camel drawn on a toe.” As a tattoo remover, Brierly has a direct line into the shifting vagaries of the human psyche. “One guy did practically his whole body,” she says. “Everything was tattooed. He’d gotten divorced and was a Muslim.” As some Muslims believe tattoos are forbidden, she thinks they were his way of declaring he didn’t want to be a Muslim any more. There was just one problem: he rediscovered his faith. “All that was within six months.” The most common tattoos Brierly removes, however, are tribal designs out of favour since their 90s heyday. “Tramp stamps” – a tattoo on a woman’s lower back – are also routinely sandblasted away, as are dolphins, another relic of the 90s. (Samantha Cameron has one on her foot.) More recently, Brierly has had clients coming in to have full sleeves removed, as the 2010s trend beloved of footballers and social media influencers burns itself out. And then, of course, there are names – heartbreak is always good business for the tattoo-removal trade. “We’re impulsive,” says Brierly when asked what she has learned from her career. “Very impulsive.” In an adjacent treatment room, Candice Smith is having a youthful indiscretion scrubbed clean. “I remember I was walking down the street,” says the 30-year-old social work student, from east London, “and someone said: ‘She’s got a strawberry on her leg!’ I think that did it for me.” I contemplate the offending soft fruit, on Smith’s left calf. It is the size of a baby’s head, badly rendered in wobbly fluorescent pink. In all honesty, she’s making the right call. “It was only a small tattoo I wanted,” Smith sighs. “But it ended up being massive.” Smith can’t even remember why she got the strawberry tattoo – she is not particularly keen on the fruit but was 18 at the time, a wannabe Camden scene kid with tattoos, a face full of piercings, and an extreme haircut. “The regret kicked in as I got older,” Smith says. She’s having it lasered off so that she no longer has to worry about covering it when the weather gets warm. “Over the years,” she says, “it has just ruined every summer. I’m forever trying to cover it with the perfect length dress, and midi dresses aren’t my thing. Or culottes, which I don’t really like, but I wear because they cover the tattoo.” She is halfway through a course of six treatments, at a cost of £600, and her tattoo is much faded, although still visible. (Most tattoos take a number of sessions to be removed.) “I was shocked at how much it cost,” Smith says. “But I felt like getting this removed was very worth it for me.” Astonishingly, despite all this, she doesn’t regret the tattoo, and says it serves as a learning curve for her children. Beside her, practitioner Rene Cazzetta is programming the laser to the correct setting. Cazzetta is a smiling and ebullient presence with more than a decade’s experience in laser tattoo removal. Tattoos like Smith’s, she explains, pose a challenge, because pink is especially tricky to remove. “The way tattoo removal works,” Cazzetta says, “is that the laser breaks down the ink into very small particles, and the blood that flows under the skin takes away the ink.” The laser works on all skin types with black ink, but it can cause pigmentation – a permanent change to the colour of the skin – with coloured tattoos on black skin. Pink, yellow, and white are the most stubborn colours to remove; a practitioner may be able to fade them considerably, but a trace will remain. “They will go down in potency,” says Cazzatta, “and look like a bruise.” Some clients choose to cover up these faded remnants with a new tattoo; others are simply happy for their old ink to be barely visible. Visitors to the clinic are increasingly seeking to have their old tattoos removed and replaced by handiwork from artists more talented than the one who did the original tattoo. With darker inks, the laser can have phenomenal results: the tattoo simply vanishes, as if it was never there. Cazzetta, who is heavily tattooed, knows this first-hand: she had an ex-boyfriend’s name tattooed on her body, then had it lasered off after the breakup. “I wanted to join all my clients with their experiences,” she says drily. “I felt as if I was missing out.” As her ex-boyfriend’s name was written in fine black ink, it was soon gone. “He was removed in the space of 12 weeks,” Cazzetta smiles. She relishes the challenge of a tattoo like Smith’s strawberry. “Every tattoo can be extremely different from another,” she says. “Some tattooists put cheaper ink in, which is harder to remove. I’ve been doing this for a decade. And still, sometimes, when a client walks in, I think: ‘OK, how will I do this?’” It is a skilled job that requires practitioners to understand how best to programme the laser for each pigment colour and skin type. The most difficult tattoo she has ever removed? A beauty spot, “because the ink was pushed so deep into the skin”. Smith has prepared for her session by rubbing anaesthetic numbing cream on to the tattoo – a must for anyone contemplating laser tattoo removal. Without it, says Brierly, “the pain is horrific. I’m not going to lie. It’s a feeling you can’t describe. Like burning hot oil.” The cream “takes the pain off,” Brierly says. “You can sit through it. It’s fine. You can still feel it, but it’s nothing like what it would be without it. Without it, it’s horrible.” The treatment itself takes less than two minutes: Cazzetta zaps the tattoo with a PicoWay laser, which flashes and looks a little like a soldering iron. (Practitioners switch between the two machines, the PicoSure and PicoWay, depending on the type of tattoo being removed.) “The only way I can explain it,” says Smith, “is that it feels like someone is stretching an elastic band and flicking you with it, without stopping.” At the end of the session, her strawberry is further faded: a berry stain, rather than a succulent fruit. What becomes clear, after only a few hours in the clinic, is that there are a lot of tattoos out there that are not what the client had in mind. “I knew what I wanted,” says the hairdresser Roy Sword, furiously. “I drew it, and I knew exactly where I wanted it placed.” But his tattooist – Sword practically spits when he says his name – did not get it right. “I’m annoyed I didn’t go back to the woman who did my other tattoos,” says the 45-year-old, from south London. “I should have just stuck with her.” Today, he is getting two arrows, tattooed on his wrists, removed – they are too big. “I hated them the minute they were finished,” he says. Cazzetta’s next client is also someone who didn’t get the tattoo that she had in mind. “I had this whole idea of what I wanted it to look like,” says Gem Clay, a 26-year-old who works at a Lego Store and has travelled to London from Maidstone for the day. “But the artist didn’t do it like I thought it would be done. It was my first tattoo and I got really shy and said: ‘That’s fine, I love it.’” The tattoo in question is an orange maple leaf on her upper arm. Clay then added a rose to it, thinking she would like it more, but now she regrets that too, and wants both removed. This, says Brierly, is a common error. “My advice for anyone is that if you don’t like a tattoo, don’t cover it. Just get rid of it. Because it escalates. Some people get two cover-ups and then blackout over the top, and then take it off.” It’s best to treat a bad tattoo like a recipe that’s beyond saving: toss out the entire meal and start afresh, rather than trying to salvage it with additions. Clay is in for a patch test, a legal prerequisite before she books an appointment. Cazzetta uses a laser on a portion of the tattoo, a small leaf. The laser bathes the room in a fluorescent gleam. The effect on the tattoo is remarkable: the green ink almost seems to foam, turning a cloudy yellow. Clay flinches as the laser drags the green ink to the surface of her skin: as it is her first session, she forgot to apply numbing cream. “It’s probably the most expensive tattoo I’ll ever have,” she says, “and I’m getting it removed.” Britain’s unquenchable enthusiasm for tattoos means Pulse Light Clinic is, for now, doing a roaring trade. Unless the tattoo is particularly large, most people are in and out within 15 minutes. The laser process itself takes barely any time at all – seconds, in some cases – and afterwards the area is dressed in bandages, to prevent infection and promote healing. Some people come to the clinic to have tattoos removed for professional reasons. Members of the army, cabin crew and makeup artists at upmarket department stores are all forbidden from having tattoos on display. “Sometimes clients don’t like it,” says the 30-year-old Venezuelan model Rotceh Perez, “and they have to Photoshop it out. But I didn’t really like the tattoo enough to keep it.” She’s having an angel removed from her ribs: this is her fourth session, and only a few traces of ink remain. Perez got the tattoo when she was 16. “I saw it as a kind of protection at the time,” she says. Her parents, predictably, were not thrilled. “Of course, they were mad,” she says. Now, she understands. “I will do the same with my children,” she says. “I’ll tell them: ‘Please don’t get a tattoo until you are at least 25. Then you can decide.’” Not everyone has the excuse of youth. Although a global pandemic is not a bad second. “I had coronavirus at the time,” says Tom (not his real name), a 25-year-old PR worker from London who prefers to remain anonymous, for reasons which will become clear. “I was locked in the house with the woman I was seeing at the time. And it was just a spur-of-the-moment decision. I think I was suffering from being in the house for 12 days.” Tom’s then-paramour tattooed the word ‘gravy’ on his left arm, using a needle. “I honestly can’t even remember the whole conversation [leading up to it],” says Tom. “I think it was more to do with the phrase ‘It’s all gravy’. Then I realised afterwards everyone will think I’m a northern boy – because northern boys love gravy.” Cazzetta zaps his gravy into oblivion. “You see that blanching?” she says casually. “It’s because the laser is hot and it hits the ink and makes the ink hot. And then the steam comes up and blanches the skin white. It will go down after a few minutes.” Tom slinks off into central London once more, gravy diluted. Leaving the clinic, I can’t help but wish there was a PicoSure for all of our mistakes. Terrible boyfriend? Scald him away with a burst of concentrated light. Working in a career you hate? Laser those bosses into oblivion. Your regrets almost instantly fixed; vanished, as if they never happened. Until that day comes, tattoo removal is an option for our most visible errors of judgment.

1/6/2022,"While Florida has experienced a record number of Covid-19 cases and sharp increase in hospitalizations in recent weeks, there is disagreement between Republicans and Democrats over whether the Omicron surge has actually overwhelmed the state’s healthcare system. For example, Florida Republican senator Marco Rubio posted on Twitter that there “is no Omicron hospital ‘surge’ in Florida. People admitted for non-Covid reasons get tested. If they test positive they get counted as a ‘Covid patient.’”  Infectious disease experts and Florida hospital leaders say that – while there is some validity to the assessment that data showing an increase in Covid hospitalizations and cases can in part be attributed to increased testing – the state’s hospitals still face potentially serious staffing shortages. One hospital in the state had to close its maternity ward because of a Covid outbreak among staff. But in short, Florida has become a focal point of the often politicized debate over whether the Omicron variant is dangerous enough to overwhelm hospital systems and requires precautions taken earlier in the pandemic. “I think there are certainly pressure points because of staffing challenges,” said Dr Joshua Lenchus, chief medical officer of Broward Health. “There has been a tremendous shift with nurses and respiratory therapists that have migrated to areas in greatest need and some areas that may compensate them better than other areas.” Florida, which its rightwing Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, touts as a place free of federal and other states’ draconian Covid-related restrictions, has seen a 566% increase in Covid cases over the past two weeks and a 246% increase in Covid hospitalizations during that time, according to data from the New York Times. Sixty-four percent of the state has been vaccinated against the virus, which is slightly higher than the country’s vaccination rate. DeSantis on Monday at a press conference described other states as “letting hysteria drive them to doing really damaging things”. While acknowledging a shortage in Covid tests, the governor and Florida’s surgeon general also said that people were testing themselves for the virus too much and that the state would issue new guidance on testing. “Without it, we’re going to be sort of stuck in the same cycle. So, it’s really time for people to be living, to make the decisions they want regarding vaccination, to enjoy the fact that many people have natural immunity,” said the state surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo. Florida Democrats blamed DeSantis for the fact that state residents have recently waited hours in line to get a Covid test. “We have not received any assistance from the state of Florida at our testing sites,” Mayor Jerry Demings of Orange county, a Democrat, said, according to NBC News. “Local governments have been left to figure it out and respond on our own. We are doing our best.” The testing shortage has also prompted some Florida residents to visit emergency rooms in search of tests. The Florida Hospital Association last week on Twitter urged people with mild or no symptoms not to visit emergency rooms for tests and instead find a testing site. “While facing the strain of workforce challenges, ERs are being put under increased pressure to provide care,” the organization stated. Lenchus, of Broward Health, attributes the demand for tests in emergency rooms to the long wait at testing sites and the fact that people don’t first turn to their primary care provider. “They show up at the emergency rooms thinking they are going to get a test,” said Lenchus. “Our hospital, as well as other hospitals, are not community testing sites. We have a limited supply of tests … like others do, and those tests should be reserved for people who are symptomatic and admitted to the hospital.” Still, Broward Health tests all patients who are admitted. While Rubio described some of the Covid hospitalization data as misleading, those tests are still important because not everyone presents with classic Covid symptoms – even though the virus could be the reason for the hospitalization – and the virus can complicate other diseases, said Dr Aileen Marty, an infectious disease expert at Florida International University. Even if a patient comes to the hospital for a different issue, a positive Covid test is important because “we have to treat that patient differently”, said Marty. The personal protective equipment “we use is different even if that person’s symptoms are not directly related to Covid”. Regardless of how representative the Covid infection and hospitalization numbers are of the scale of the problem in Florida, the virus continues to upend normal care and staffing. On 2 January, Holy Cross Health in Broward county had to shut down its labor and delivery unit because of staffing shortages due to people who became sick with the virus. Five patients have been transferred to Broward Health, and a number of other patients proactively changed their plans to physicians at the hospital, according to a Broward Health spokesperson. “There are still staffing challenges, and I think we as a healthcare community work together to ensure that the care of the community is still addressed,” said Lenchus. He and Marty both said they expected the wave to peak in the coming weeks. They are also waiting on state or federal government to provide additional monoclonal antibody treatments and Pfizer’s new antiviral pill. “I would imagine things perhaps could be better if the governor and the president played nicer together, but I would hope that as two professionals, they understand that protection of the public – which is in the oath that they swore when they took office – should take precedence over everything else,” said Lenchus. “And to their credit, when push comes to shove, when we do get into a crisis, perhaps there is some politicking, but they do come to the table and do what is right.”",News/US news,"Crisis, what crisis?

1/6/2022,"More than one in six NHS trusts across England have declared a critical incident due to Covid pressures, a cabinet minister has revealed, saying the Omicron variant was putting “very real” pressure on the health service. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said ministers were trying to find the right compromise between imposing further restrictions and not allowing hospitals to be “overrun” given new cases of the virus have reached historically high levels.  Of England’s 137 NHS trusts, at least 24 have declared a critical incident, Shapps said, meaning they have reached an alert level signalling priority services may be under threat. He added it was “crazy” some people were still not getting vaccinated given the increased protection a booster jab offers against the Omicron variant, but that the government would not take the “draconian approach” of making vaccines mandatory. Shapps told Sky News it was “not entirely unusual” for NHS trusts to “go critical over the winter – often with things like the flu pandemic”, but conceded “there are very real pressures which I absolutely recognise”. Plan B, which came into force last month across England with a return to work-from-home advice, face coverings and the introduction of Covid passes, was still the right way forward, Shapps said. He faced down criticism that England is out of step with the three other UK nations, which all imposed tougher restrictions in the light of the more transmissible variant. Shapps said: “What we want to do is steer the country through the Omicron wave, and I think plan B has so far been shown to be the right way forward – not shutting down the country yet again with all the costs to people’s mental health and elsewhere.” Hospitalisations have been slower to rise than Covid cases, with ministers buoyed by the booster rollout. A further 967 people went into hospital with the virus, according to the latest daily figure published on Wednesday, taking the total to 17,276 – the highest since last February. However, the issue has been compounded further by NHS staff being among the hundreds of thousands of people self-isolating due to the rapidly increasing number of Covid cases. A further 194,747 infections were reported on Wednesday, one of the highest on record since the pandemic began. Jon Ashworth, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said it was vital key workers – including NHS staff – got access to lateral flow tests that enable double-vaccinated people to end their isolation early from day seven if they test negative twice. He said there had been “problems with the supply” and added: “Ministers have really got to get a grip of that.” Some restrictions on travel have been lifted, with the requirement for all those arriving in England to get a pre-departure PCR test now scrapped. Shapps said travel restrictions were always temporary and that PCR-testing everyone who entered the country to check if they had Omicron was no longer necessary, given it is now the dominant variant in the UK and spreading fast in many other parts of the world. He said the previous testing rule had “effectively outlived its usefulness when it comes to travel”.",News/Society,At least 24 NHS trusts declare critical incidents due to Covid pressures,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/06/nhs-trusts-england-critical-incidents-covid-pressures-omicron
1/6/2022,"Plans to tackle the “catastrophic impact” of the Covid pandemic on patients waiting for NHS treatment could be derailed by emergency care demands and a lack of staff, MPs have said. With about 6 million people already waiting for planned treatment, the backlog caused by the pandemic is a major and “unquantifiable” challenge as more people seek care, according to the cross-party health and social care committee.  A record number of 999 calls and long waits to be seen in A&E, coupled with an increase in the number of people waiting for planned care could result in an “entirely predictable staffing crisis” as burned-out staff quit the NHS. In its report, the committee calls for a wide-ranging national health and care recovery plan encompassing emergency care, mental health, GPs, community care and social care. The committee chair, Jeremy Hunt, also called for short-term measures to tackle the crisis. “We need to go a lot further. We’ve got 6 million people on the waiting list, we’ve got a crisis in our A&E departments, a record number of 999 calls, double the referrals to children and young people’s mental health in some areas,” he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme on Thursday. “We don’t have […] a workforce plan that says how we are going to get these 4,000 doctors, and unless we do that we’re going to find this incredible frustration from taxpayers’ point of view that they’re putting the money in but they’re not getting the results out that they were promised.” The report states that of the 5.8 million patients who were waiting to start treatment in September 2021, 300,000 had been waiting more than a year and 12,000 more than two years. MPs said government promises to carry out 9m extra checks, scans and operations would not be deliverable “without better short and long-term workforce planning”. The report noted that there were 93,000 vacancies for NHS positions and “shortages in nearly every specialty”, while there were 105,000 vacancies and a turnover rate of 28.5% in social care. Although the health secretary, Sajid Javid, had promised a plan would be produced by the end of November 2021, the report said NHS England had yet to publish details. “We remain unconvinced there are sufficient plans for recruitment and retention of staff,” said the report. MPs had previously called for short and long-term workforce projections, but plans to enshrine the requirement in law had been voted down by the government, and without that information it was “impossible for anyone” to know if enough doctors, nurses and care staff were being trained. “This creates a gap between ministerial rhetoric about supporting frontline staff and refusal in practice to do the biggest single long-term change that would relieve the pressure they face,” the MPs said. While use of the private sector to tackle the backlog was broadly welcomed, the report noted that it risked exacerbating existing health inequalities, as private hospitals tended to be in more affluent areas, whereas waiting lists were biggest in more deprived areas.The report warned against a target culture which could compromise quality and patient safety, and the efficacy of encouraging people to call 111 for urgent but non-life threatening medical need as no evaluation had been carried out. Dr David Wrigley, the British Medical Association’s deputy council chair, said the report exposed the “gargantuan challenge” facing the NHS. “The biggest barrier to tackling the backlog caused by the pandemic is a severe staffing crisis and our calls for improved workforce planning have thankfully been heard. It’s now time for the government to listen too.”",News/Politics,MPs call for urgent action to tackle NHS treatment waiting list,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/06/mps-call-for-urgent-action-to-tackle-nhs-treatment-waiting-list

1/6/2022,"Awitty retelling of a classic that leaves no buckle unswashed and no wink to the adults unwinked, this is the kind of production that, in a normal year, would have played to packed houses over the festive season. That this isn’t a normal year means that vacant seats in the auditorium and masks on the faces of those in seats that are occupied create a more subdued atmosphere than this hugely energetic and entertaining production deserves. But it is still a show that will surely make theatre lovers out of youngsters experiencing the art form for the first time. Adapter Ella Hickson wrings out the humour in every corner of the script, from an unrequited love story between Smee and Captain Hook to near-the-knuckle jokes about the anatomical logistics of how exactly a fairy might end up on top of a tree and, more importantly, stay there.  Taking JM Barrie’s original story and centring Wendy Darling in it is a smart move from Hickson and one that Amber James exploits to the full, playing the Darling girl like Dawn French in her pomp. Her counterpart, Pierro Niel-Mee, gives us a Peter Pan that is one part Rik Mayall’s Lord Flashheart with a generous helping of Robin Williams as he played the role in Hook, Steven Spielberg’s 1991 telling of the story. It’s a modern sensibility that works for a script that is Pixarian in its ability to appeal to all ages: those who grew up with The Simpsons will look at Smee and think Smithers, while the youngsters on whom those jokes are lost will surely simply marvel at the spectacular stage fights. Jonathan Munby, who directed the original version of this for the RSC in 2013, throws everything at this, alongside co-director Rupert Hands, staging the piece with huge bombast while not shying away from the story’s dark undertones of death and grief. The production, which was staged at the Tokyo Olympics, has been hit by delays to the set arriving from Japan and cancellations caused by cases of Covid among the cast over Christmas. It has been entirely worth the wait.
