1/22/2022,"One night last week, I sat in my kitchen with my eyes closed, inhaling the rich, earthy scent of tomatoes. I felt transported: I was in an Italian garden, sun-dappled leaves swaying as I picked the plump, ripe fruit for a late pasta dinner with my large and beautiful family. I was, in essence, one of the puppets from the Dolmio adverts. But the smell wasn’t coming from a tomato. It was coming from a candle. How did they make it smell so real? I called my boyfriend over to share in this miracle. He put his face right over the flame, said that it smelled like burnt nose hair and quickly lost interest. But I remained tickled by this magic trick. A candle, that smells like tomatoes!  There is something in the air at the moment, and it’s not just vine tomato candles: ever more eclectic smells – from the uplifting to the downright bizarre – have been making their way into perfume and candles. Is it a consequence of having been so smell-starved, so downright bored during the pandemic? An increased desire for the things we buy to give us experiences beyond mere enjoyment? And why do people want to smell weird stuff? Our interest in these smells has now spread outside our homes and into our cultural, public spaces. The past year alone has seen: an exhibition of floating machines perfumed with smells of coal, marine life and vegetation at Tate Modern; a gallery in the Hague infused with the fishy odour of a 17th-century Dutch canal; and a dedicated olfactory art space launched in New York. Olfactory art is far from new. Coffee beans were roasted behind a screen to create “the smell of Brazil” at the International Surrealist Exhibition of 1938. And let’s not forget the experiential dining experience at places like El Bulli and the Fat Duck at the start of this century. But the fact that we still view it as something of a novelty suggests we still view smell as a lesser sense. Novelty scents have been around for a while. In the US, Demeter Fragrance Librarywas established in 1996 selling perfumes based on everyday scents. It started with Dirt, Grass and Tomato, and has since expanded into more unusual smells like Play-Doh, New Car and Funeral Home. Yankee Candles’ off-the-wall options have included Bacon, Schnitzel with Noodles, and something rather unnervingly called Man Town. Anya Hindmarch sells candles that smell like pencil shavings and chewing gum. D. S. and Durga make several weird scents, including one called Burning Barbershop, which is supposed to smell like a specific barbershop in New York state that caught fire. I’ve never been, but the pleasing woody smell made me want to. Recent years have seen a rise in avant garde scents and more prosaic smells, says fragrance writer, Lizzie Ostrom. Perfumed goods used to be about beauty and vanity, she says. “But now we’re thinking, ooh, what is it that a fragrance can do? And what sorts of fragrances might I like that aren’t just the usual scents that I thought I wanted to wear?” Surprisingly, it seems the pandemic only increased our olfactory desire. We didn’t have any nights out to smell nice for, yet somehow the fragrance industry didn’t suffer at all – perfume sales were up 45% in the first quarter of this year. “I think people discovered that fragrance was not just for someone else to smell and admire, but is primarily a personal experience, with the power to make you feel good about yourself,” said public relations specialist Daniel Williams. Scented candles saw a huge boost in sales, too. Deprived of many kinds of stimulation – including smells other than that of our own homes or our breath inside a face mask, it’s no wonder we turned to scented candles. If we were going to be stuck in our homes 23 hours a day, we might as well make home a nice place to be. One of the many unhinged habits I developed during the winter lockdown was sitting in my bed holding a scented candle in both hands, breathing deeply from the flame and thinking, “what am I doing?” Looking back, I think my nose was hungry. Loss of smell as a side-effect of Covid has been a common experience in the p 18 eighteen months, and people who regain their sense of smelloften report that it comes back in patchy, faulty ways – smelling things that aren’t there, or favourite foods now smelling like sewage. Doctors have recommended “smell training” : buying essential oils and sniffing them repeatedly as a sort of nose physio to try to retrain the body to sense aromas. Remedies for smell loss trending on social media include eating burnt oranges. “Getting their sense of smell back has for millions of people a real source of relief and joy – and perhaps now they’re wanting to really explore,” Ostrom said. Vegetables are having a moment – as well as the Daylesford vine tomato candle that so impressed me, I could have a Loewe room spray that smell like coriander or beetroot – but there are also candles that smell of chlorine, and perfumes with a base note of asphalt. If I really wanted my bathroom to smell like beetroots, I would put some beetroots in there. And all the talk of everyday smells magically replicated at the light of a wick or the pump of an atomizer has a touch of 1999 about it, of scratch-and-sniff cards, and dorky experiments with Smell-o-vision. Last year, a lingerie brand released a range of “pillow mists”, supposedly designed to help you sleep, that smelled like celebrities such as Harry Styles and Maya Jama. Hotels, cars, sports stadiums have “signature scents”. McDonald’s did a line of Quarter Pounder-scented candles in February 2020. Products are also increasingly taking inspiration, although one hopes not ingredients, from the human body. There’s the infamous Goop vagina candle, of course, but that’s nothing compared with a scent called Vulva Original. The Amazon listing promises “intense scent of a vagina”, and it has some of the more disturbing reviews I’ve read in my time, including: “I have met several girls and I know what that smells like …” But for something truly out there, Etat Libre d’Orange’s Sécrétions Magnifiques is just the thing. The scent claims to smell of blood, sweat, sperm and saliva, and reviewers describe it as “upsetting”, “completely unwearable”, and like “sweaty debauchery in the locker room of an indoor pool with rusty metal ladders”. How much is this all just gimmick, simply another way to sell us stuff? Prof. David Howes, director of the Centre for Sensory Studies in Montreal and co-author of Aroma: The Cultural History of Smell, is rightly sceptical of this sort of marketing strategy, which relies on dodgy science about smell appealing to a primitive part of our brains: “The idea is that marketers can get under the conscious defences of the cerebral cortex by using smell to market things, which I think is rubbish. That kind of physiological reductionism is really just another marketing ploy.” Still, we ought to be wary of crying gimmick at any unusual smell experiences – and scents in art galleries – because we’re not trained to take smell seriously. Because of the Proustian madeleine moment, we in the west tend to connect smells with memories and emotions. We don’t think of, say, communication, or knowledge. Philosophers Aristotle, Kant and Hegel believed that the sense of smell it should be considered below sight and hearing, and Freud had almost a horror of smell, referring to it as something that we needed to move beyond now that we were no longer going around on all fours like dogs. Howes goes as far to say that we live in an odour-phobic society. “Witness all of our deodorising and then re-odourising rituals: the morning shower followed by adding all these artificial scents.” Why should smell remain such a neglected sense? Why should people wear one perfume but have a wardrobe full of clothes, several Spotify playlists, and eat different meals every night but balk at filling their living rooms with different scents? Just as we can learn to like fine whisky and coffee, we can learn to appreciate stranger smells – and perhaps should. “Our noses are woefully uneducated now,” Howes told me, “and I’m very much in favour of liberating the nose. It has been kept down for too long.” Last week, I came across a scent called Stercus. Made by perfumer Allessandro Gualtieri, Stercus is Latin for dung. “He [Gualtieri] is eccentric to say the least,” said Daniel Williams of the PR agency. “You’resitting there at a press launch and when you ask him what the smell is based around, he tells you it’s his anus.” When this bottle – which I’m sorry to have to tell you is brown – arrived at my flat, I interrupted my housemate watching a documentary about space and asked him to smell it with me. I gave it a couple of spritzes, and waited. “It’s like if you used a leather bag to steal a load of vanilla candles” he said, confusion on his face. I told him what the special note was, and we both sat there sniffing the air and thinking about arseholes. “I kind of like it,” he said. If you didn’t know what the scent’s origin was, you wouldn’t necessarily suspect, although there is an unmistakable note of the farmyard about it. Maybe all this is only the beginning. Maybe in 50 years’ time, when we’re stinking to high heaven of all manner of as-yet unimaginable futuristic smells, we’ll look back and think: “Chewing gum candles? Anus perfume? That’s nothing.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Scents and sensibility: what’s behind the rise of extreme smells?,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/22/scents-and-sensibility-whats-behind-the-rise-of-extreme-smells
1/22/2022,"Chopping down trees is not how most people would expect a river restoration project to begin, but Janne Raassina – who is expertly using a chainsaw to take down four or five earmarked trunks around the Särkkäjoki River in remotest eastern Finland – explains that the rotting wood will be hugely useful to the ecosystem. “This is a huge buffet for insects, and it’s something that has been missing in our nature for 100 years,” he says. “We are creating the food chain from scratch.”  Finland is the most heavily forested country in Europe, with about 76% of its land area cloaked by trees. However, this impressive statistic disguises the ecological damage that has been inflicted by the forestry industry over the last century or so. The old growth has almost entirely vanished, replaced by the skeletal monocultures of commercial plantations; today, less than 5% of Finland’s forest cover is more than 120 years old. These are a pale imitation of the lichen-laden, berry-filled forests of old – and the wildlife has suffered as a result. Rivers have been another casualty of Finland’s rapid industrialisation. From the 1850s, before the age of roads and rail, its waterways were engineered into unobstructed channels to create a vast fluvial transport network. Rapids were removed and bends straightened to allow logs to float hundreds of miles downstream for processing. The supply of dead wood that would once have fed into the rivers dwindled as the surrounding birch, pine and spruce was cleared. Though timber floating stopped by the 1980s, its legacy of sterility persists: the diversity of habitats that would have existed throughout the meanders and wetlands of a natural river system never returned, and the forestry industry continues to deprive these ecosystems of their dead wood. Studies of individual rivers have shown, in some cases, the complete decimation of once-thriving populations of fish. The stream that flows before us looks healthy enough, but, says Raassina, it is ecologically dead. All the creatures you would expect to see here – including fish, mayflies and other insects – have vanished. An investigation into the tributaries of the Lieksanjoki River failed to return a single brown trout. “We’re basically starting from zero. Our nation has been so shortsighted,” says Raassina. He and his two contractors, Janne Ratilainen and Henri Leskinen, have been tasked with restoring life to this 12km (7.5–mile) stretch of the Särkkäjoki, as well as 1.5km of another stream, the Rännänjoki, that crosses into Finland from Russia. Both flow into the larger Lieksanjoki river in the North Karelia region of eastern Finland. As well as adding dead wood to the water, the restoration work has involved adding gravel to the riverbed, recreating old spawning grounds for fish, and moving rocks from the riverbank into the water to hide the juveniles from predators. “The fish have all the instincts, but nowhere to practise them,” says Raassina. Some might hesitate to call this rewilding; with the need for chainsaws and a lot of manual labour, no one could suggest that they are taking a hands-off approach. However, the emphasis is ultimately on creating an ecosystem that will sustain itself over time, without the need for constant intervention. Raassina’s enthusiasm for the concept is immediately apparent: he has turned up for the day in a hoodie and a baseball cap, both emblazoned with “Rewilding” in an eye-catching comic sans. “I think rewilding is a really good term. I haven’t found any better in Finnish,” he says. While the focus is initially on creating healthy habitats, the ultimate mark of victory will be whether the trout return to them. Ideally, these would repopulate the river by themselves, but given the absence of the species in the surrounding area, it is likely that they will have to be reintroduced. It is a small start to a monumental task. The country has about 650 rivers. About 90 of these are major rivers that discharge into the sea or across borders; the rest are tributaries. But the Finnish public has embraced the task of river restoration. Because 60% of Finland’s forests are divided up between hundreds of thousands of private landowners, this has created plenty of work for Raassina, who initially turned down the project because he was too busy. What makes this project notable, however, is that the state-owned forestry company Metsähallitus is at the helm. It owns almost a third of Finland’s land, and without this powerhouse onboard, efforts to restore life to the “land of a thousand lakes” will always be piecemeal. If the agency can be persuaded of the value of this work, the potential for Finland’s river systems is enormous. Metsähallitus has worked on water-based restoration projects before, but this is the first time it has explicitly addressed the small creeks and their catchment areas that crisscross the larger part of the land. “Metsähallitus has been known for restoring swamps and marsh mires, but not so much creeks, rivers and lakes. But more and more, the focus is also turning to these water ecosystems nowadays,” says Arttu Kuiri, who designed the North Karelian part of the programme. He adds that every single one of Finland’s smaller streams would benefit from restoration, but with funding of just under €1m they had to settle on nine river basins. “People are starting to understand that rivers and clean waters are like the heart and lungs of the country,” says Kuiri. “Finland doesn’t really have anything else other than nature, and if we are going to ruin that, it doesn’t end well.” The scale of the damage means that wholescale river restoration will be no easy task. At Särkkäjoki, Raassina points out that a layer of sediment has gathered on one of the larger rocks. It is barely noticeable – a fine dusting of dirt – and yet it points to another major problem: soil erosion. Finland’s vast peatlands have been carved up by drainage ditches over the years, destabilising its once-waterlogged soils in the name of timber production. If the country is to have healthy rivers again, looking beyond the banks and towards the wider landscape will be essential. Kuiri agrees on the need for humans to set the wheels in motion. “We had good rivers and they have been healthy, but in a hundred years we have done so much bad to them. We need to revoke that – and the stones won’t move themselves.” For now, in North Karelia, the Särkkäjoki looks like it has lost a fight with a particularly industrious beaver – and that, of course, is the point. The chainsaw has done its work.",News/Environment,‘We’re basically starting from zero’: Restoring Finland’s river ecosystems,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/22/finland-restoring-river-ecosystems-rewilding
1/22/2022,"My right arm was out of action for weeks last year and it caused me to ponder again how ill-served those with long-term and more serious motor difficulties are by consumer industries, including beauty. It’s extremely hard to remove shiny screw-top lids, operate pipettes and prise open stiff palettes when you have only one or no working hands. Despite its feted 2019 inception, Grace Beauty – a brand specialising in stylish ergonomic grips for everyday makeup – has all but vanished, so for the time being, it’s a matter of seeking out existing products with accidental benefits. I found the matte finish of the lids and (refillable) plastic bottles from Skingredients easy to lift off and replace one-handed, and the pumps sufficiently sturdy for good purchase. Skin Good Fats, from £44, a creamy, barrier moisturiser for all skins, is my most used.  Almost all Drunk Elephant products (C-Firma, £52.80, is an outstanding vitamin C serum) feature twist-up pump dispensers that can be operated one-handed and dispensed directly on to the face. Milk Makeup has similarly accessible packaging: its chubby, non-slippery sticks of colour (Mini Lip+Cheek, £16.50, is an essential) can be twisted up easily, then daubed and blended without the need to grip a brush (though Kohl Kreatives has an extensive line of makeup brushes designed for those with motor disabilities, from £8.99). Makeup palettes can be tricky to handle, but Viseart’s Pro and Petits Fours shadows come in gatefold cardboard-lidded palettes that flip open without a clasp, then sit flat, so you won’t have to chase it around the tabletop with a brush. The eyeshadows are impeccable. To finish the look, Lottie London’s wing edition stamp liner, £5.95, requires less dexterity than a traditional eyeliner. You simply press the rubber stamp nib on to each eyelid for identical feline flicks. All this comes at a cost, inevitably, and there is gross unfairness in being penalised for the privilege of using everyday items. Hope came in Olay’s December piloting of its easy-open lid, a limited run of chunky tops with winged handles that will fit all Olay moisturisers, as part of manufacturer P&G’s pledge to make its packaging more accessible for people with disabilities. The new lids are so far available only in North America, but hopes are high for a UK release. Big change comes from huge brands, and this one is overdue.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Unlocked: the best beauty products for people with less mobility | Sali Hughes,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/22/unlocked-the-best-beauty-products-for-people-with-reduced-mobility
1/22/2022,"At 37 years old, LeBron James is having one of the best seasons of his 18-year NBA career. The Los Angeles Lakers star is averaging 28.8 points (his most since 2009-10), 7.6 rebounds and 6.4 assists in 33 games this season, shooting 51.7% from the field, 36.4% from three and 75.4% from the free-throw line, all above his career averages. After a relatively slow start and then an abdominal injury that sidelined him for eight games, James has been an MVP-level player over his last 15 games, averaging 33/9/6 on 53/37/75 shooting splits with 1.5 steals and 1.3 blocks.  And yet his Lakers – who entered the season as title contenders and who are 15 months removed from winning an NBA championship – are 22-23 on the season, including 6-9 over that same stretch. They currently rank eighth in the Western Conference standings, firmly in the play-in tournament if the season were to end today. Worse than that, the Lakers are experiencing internal strife, with head coach Frank Vogel reportedly on the hot seat fighting for his job, and the stubbornly proud Russell Westbrook being benched down the stretch of their most recent home loss to the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night. Vogel explained his benching of Westbrook as: “Playing the guys that I thought were going to win the game.” And Westbrook said he was “disappointed” by the decision but remains determined to figure it out with the Lakers, saying, “I’ve done everything that’s been asked of me here, and I’ll continue to do so and ride this out as long as we can toward our ultimate goal – and that’s to win a championship.” After being blown out by the Nuggets 133-96, we as @Lakers fans can accept being outplayed but we deserve more than a lack of effort and no sense of urgency. Owner @JeanieBuss, you deserve better. #LakerNation I apologize and I promise we’ll be better! 👑💜💛 But are Vogel and Westbrook actually at fault for the Lakers’ struggles this season? Or was the composition of this team doomed from the start? To be fair, the Lakers are missing 28-year-old big man Anthony Davis, who has missed 15 games and counting with a sprained MCL in his left knee but could return as soon as this week. But it’s not like the Lakers were world-beaters before Davis’ injury, going 13-14 with Davis in the lineup this season as he struggled to shoot the ball (17.9% from three) and provide the requisite spacing for James and Westbrook to co-exist. Clearly, the Lakers’ problems go beyond injuries or bouts with Covid-19, which every NBA team has dealt with this season. In reality, the problems date back to the offseason, when the Lakers front office – led by general manager Rob Pelinka and no doubt advised by (assistant GM) LeBron James – made a number of questionable decisions that culminated in the roster being ill-fitting and the players being by far the oldest in the league, with an average age of 30.0. By adding several past-their prime stars including Carmelo Anthony (37), Dwight Howard (36), Trevor Ariza (36), DeAndre Jordan (33), and to a lesser extent even Westbrook (33), the Lakers bucked the league-wide trend of youth in favor of veterans. But those veterans have struggled to perform, especially on the defensive end of the floor, where they contribute to the Lakers’ 20th-ranked defense. Plus, where the Lakers did go young, they seem to have made a significant mistake, choosing to re-sign unproven but promising 21-year-old combo-guard Talen Horton-Tucker to a three-year, $31m contract (including a player-option on the final year) instead of holding on to a proven thing in 27-year-old shooting guard Alex Caruso, who spent his first four seasons with the Lakers and fit in perfectly besides James. Horton-Tucker has been disappointing and inefficient this season while Caruso, who signed a modest four-year, $37m contract (including a partially guaranteed final year) with the Chicago Bulls this offseason, has been better in virtually every statistical category and has helped drive the feel-good Bulls to the top of the Eastern Conference. But the biggest miscue of all was the Westbrook trade. After going 42-30 last season – a disappointing record at the time but one that they would do anything to have now – the Lakers took a swing for the fences, trading Kyle Kusma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Montrezl Harrell and the No 22 pick in the 2021 NBA draft to the Washington Wizards for Westbrook. Sure, the 2017 NBA MVP was coming off a fantastic second-half of the season with the Wizards, where he (and Bradley Beal) willed the team to a 18-7 finish and the 8th seed, averaging 23/14/14(!) on 45/33/74 shooting splits. But Westbrook was always going to be a clunky fit besides James (and to a lesser extent Davis), because while he is one of the most electrifying and athletic point guards to ever play the game, he is ultimately a non-shooter who needs the ball in his hands to succeed. It never made sense to take the ball out of James’ hands – arguably the greatest on-ball player the NBA has ever seen – to accommodate Westbrook. Plus, the Westbrook trade made the Lakers financially inflexible and bereft of meaningful assets. As one of the highest-paid players in the NBA, Westbrook makes $44m this season (and $47m next year), so the Lakers were forced to fill out the rest of their roster with minimum-salary contracts – hence the old players at the end of their careers. Clearly, the Lakers took a swing and missed. But they haven’t struck out just yet. After all, this is the Lakers we are talking about, and normal rules do not apply to the NBA’s most glamorous franchise; nor do they apply to teams led by James, arguably the greatest basketball player ever, who is relentlessly chasing his fifth ring. Davis will be back soon, and Vogel will try to make the Westbrook-James-Davis trio work for as long as he remains in the coaching chair. The good news is that the Lakers have been very good when those three share the court and even better when they do so without a traditional center, outscoring opponents by 12.2 points per 100 possessions in those lineups. It will be key for the Lakers to build continuity in the second half of the season, as they have already used 21 different starting lineups and their most-used five-man lineup has played just 68 minutes together, while every other NBA team has had at least one lineup play a minimum 100 minutes together. Still, the roster is not balanced or deep enough to make a run at a title as currently constructed. And that is what they intend to do considering two of their three best players are 33 and 37 years old and the other one has a history of injury problems. In other words, the time is now. The Lakers have very few avenues to improve their roster ahead of the February 10th trade deadline, with Horton-Tucker, Kendrick Nunn, and a 2027 first-round pick the only real assets that they could deal. But they will make a run at impactful two-way players such as Detroit’s Jerami Grant or Sacramento’s Harrison Barnes, it’s just unclear if they have enough assets to get a deal of any significance done. For the time being, the Lakers are about to embark on a six-game road trip after a relatively easy, home-based schedule to start their season. In other words, their biggest test is yet to come.",Sport/Sport,"The creaky, mediocre Los Angeles Lakers should have seen this coming",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/22/los-angeles-lakers-struggles-mediocre
1/22/2022,"“Stagey” is a term generally used as a slight against a film, evoking that stiff, musty sense of confinement so particular to a bad play. But it doesn’t have to be. Some films use the restrictions of theatre – a small cast, a single location – to match on camera the intensity and intimacy of live performance, fused with the very screen-specific benefits of the closeup. American actor turned director Fran Kranz’s impressive debut feature, Mass (now streaming on Sky Cinema), is one such film. Set entirely within a suburban Episcopal church, and mostly within the four walls of a bland function room, it is stagey in the tensest, tautest sense. The setup is simple and wrenching: the church hall has been chosen as a neutral space for peace talks of a kind, between two sets of parents who are at once strangers to each other and inextricably connected by the tragedy of a school shooting – that most increasingly, queasily familiar of American atrocities. Depending on your point of view, there’s either much to be said here or nothing at all: eventually, they opt for the former, talking through waves and counter-waves of grief, guilt and white-hot anger.  You watch it thinking Kranz has done justice to what must have been an exceptional play, though the surprise is that it’s no adaptation: an original screenplay that deftly articulates specific personal crisis against a wounded national conscience. In an exercise of four people talking, of course, it helps if the four happen to be tremendous actors. Jason Isaacs, Ann Dowd, Martha Plimpton and Reed Birney make for an exquisite ensemble, one person’s rage bouncing off the other’s vulnerability, their silences as loaded as their shouting matches. It’s tempting to call it a great actors’ showcase, but that makes it sound like the film is under glass: Mass, for all its rigorous minimalism, feels full-blooded, with characters you want to reach out and touch. Kranz’s debut thus joins a fine subset of single location films that feel bigger and richer than the sum of their parts, or the square footage of their set. Some of the best of them, of course, are taken directly from the boards. There has perhaps never been a better theatre-to-film transfer than Mike Nichols’s scorching, tonic-bitter take on Edward Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966; Apple TV), which honoured the bilious text while riffing on the fascination of Hollywood’s most volatile celebrity couple, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Hitchcock was a dab hand at single location cinema – also proved in Lifeboat and Rear Window – but in his 1948 film of the Patrick Hamilton play Rope (Chili), the illusion of being shot in one real-time take added a jittery urgency to its suspense mechanics. William Friedkin’s underrated Bug (2006; Google Play), meanwhile, used the spatial restrictions of Tracy Letts’s play to amp up the claustrophobic nature of its conspiracy-minded psychodrama. 12 Angry Men (1957; Amazon) began as a teleplay, and later made its way to stage, but found its perfect form in Sidney Lumet’s blazing, debate-driven court drama, which ensured that no one can ever do jury service again without at least briefly pondering a righteous, me-against-the-world speech. There’s no such grandstanding in Louis Malle’s My Dinner With Andre (1981; Curzon), which instead uses the limitations of its single restaurant table setup to tune into the wayward, circuitous rhythms of human conversation. Far from that film’s genial naturalism, Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1972; BFI Player) reaches an overwhelming melodramatic pitch as it explores female co-habitation and co-dependency from one woman’s bedroom. Finally, single location films needn’t always confine themselves to the great indoors. Wolfgang Fischer’s superb, little-seen maritime thriller Styx (2018; Apple TV+) played out a life-or-death refugee crisis on the deck of one small sailboat, while Steven Knight’s Locke (2013; Now TV), starring Tom Hardy, sees a family man’s life come apart behind the wheel of a moving car on the motorway. Mass, in all its small beauty, seems positively epic by comparison. The Nest(Picturehouse)Canadian writer-director Sean Durkin took 10 years to follow up his breakthrough film, Martha Marcy May Marlene, with another feature, but this skin-prickling, extraordinarily well-acted domestic nightmare starring Jude Law and Carrie Coon proves he was no flash in the pan. Tracing an Anglo-American family coming apart at the seams after moving to a Surrey mansion in the 1980s, it mingles lacerating marital drama with the heavy dread of a horror film. Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn(Amazon/Apple TV)Romanian director Radu Jude won the Golden Bear at Berlin last year for this rude, raucous, intellectually fizzing black comedy, in which a Bucharest schoolteacher fights to save her job and clear her name after a personal sex tape of hers hits the web. The shadow of Covid era adds further layers of panic chaos to a bumptious satirical provocation. Dear Evan Hansen(Amazon/Apple TV)Last year brought us a surfeit of ambitious screen musicals with decidedly mixed results – none more disappointing than this beige, bloodless adaptation of the Tony- and Olivier-laden smash about a misfit teen caught up in the ramifications of an ill-judged lie. Diehard fans of the show may still be moved, though it gives the unacquainted no clue as to what the fuss was about.",Arts/Film,Streaming: Mass and other great single location films ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/22/streaming-mass-and-other-great-single-location-films
1/22/2022," Tarik Abdeladim, 51 “When I started out, getting harisssa in York wasn’t easy,” says Tarik Abdeladim. “There was one stockist.” Chefs have been frantic since reopening after lockdown, he says. “The combination of Brexit and the pandemic has been like a tsunami hitting our industry. We’re a tourist city. European staff, especially those without families here, have gone home.” He employs 20 mostly local workers. “People used to drop their CVs in all the time. I recently advertised for chefs and didn’t have one response. That’s a huge geographical and emotional shift; people no longer want to work long kitchen hours away from home.” Abdeladim moved to London from Algiers in 1990, aged 20: “We’d visit Paris when I was young and I worked in kitchens on the Côte d’Azur, so Europe was always on my radar. I visited a friend in London and fell in love with British culture, history, music, football. I never went home.” Having worked first as a pot washer, then later as a waiter and front of house, he moved to York in 1997, after visiting the city. “As an immigrant, language is a barrier to jobs,” he says, “but being in restaurants was what I knew. The pot wash suited me till I knew enough to speak to customers and take orders.” His falafel wraps and fiery merguez sausage, served with harissa on hot baguettes, quickly became the city’s top-rated food on Tripadvisor, after he opened a stall on Shambles Market in 2015. When a regular offered to sell him their restaurant three years later, he established Los Moros – a Spanish nod to his Berber heritage – serving modern north African cuisine. Its picturesque British exterior belies the colours and aromas of an Algerian souk you’ll find within. Abdeladim’s food is steeped in the legacies of Algeria’s invaders. He says: “My indigenous Berber family cooked tagines. My grandmother sat for hours at our kitchen table making kilos of couscous from semolina. The Romans brought olives and citrus; the Arabs brought spices; the Turks came to defend us, bringing coffee and baklava; and, finally, the French, with the croissants I ate for breakfast back home. All the cultures that shaped my taste buds exist on my menu.” They include the merguez he first cooked for his stall, now served in a butter bean dish his mother used to make:. “My father would go to the best butcher in Algiers.” Abdeladim says. “It’s the food of my childhood. When I came here at 20, I was young and adventurous, I wanted to discover and learn. My own business was never part of the plan. A guy from the Michelin guide tweeted about my food last year. I never envisaged that.” Algerian cassoulet (merguez and beans) Serves 4 2 tbsp olive oil1 large white Spanish onion, peeled and finely chopped2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced1 tsp sea salt1 tsp freshly ground cumin1 tsp paprika½ tsp ground coriander½ tsp ground ginger½ tsp turmeric½ tsp ground chilli (or more, if you like it hot)1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes1 tbsp tomato puree500g merguez sausages, each cut into 3 equal pieces500g drained, cooked butter beans (ie from 2 x 400g cans – we use Navarrico large butter beans)1 handful each flat-leaf parsley and coriander, roughly choppedCrusty baguette to serve Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. add the onion, garlic and salt, and fry until translucent. Add the spices, cook for a further minute or two, then stir in the tomatoes, tomato puree and half a pint of water, and cook on a medium heat for 10-15 minutes. Throw in the chopped merguez nd cook for another 15 minutes until the sausages are cooked, then add the beans and cook on a low heat until the sauce turns nice and thick. Adjust the seasoning to taste, stir in the chopped herbs and serve with a crusty baguette to mop up the sauce, Algerian style. Y Sok, 45 “Hunger pain never leaves you,” says Y Sok, who was raised in a refugee camp in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge civil war, where Red Cross food parcels sustained her family before they moved to America. “Every day there was a lottery system for a new life in France, the US or Australia. My father chose America.” She moved to the UK in 2014, aged 37: “I remember hanging up our sign and someone saying, ‘We’ll see how long that lasts.’ I wanted to change the perception of Asian food, the racism around it. People grew up eating £5 Chinese meals from the chippy but wouldn’t blink at paying triple for pasta. I wanted the suburbs to discover what ethnic food really is.” Sok’s 20 staff, who also run a market outpost, are mostly South Asian or Cambodian. She wants to sponsor skilled-worker visas for another two. “It is hard to find a Cambodian chef from our tiny UK population,” she says. “I have found loyalty in immigrant staff, who come looking for better opportunities. If you treat them well, give full benefits and respect, most tend to stay.” The restaurant, where walls are adorned with framed vinyls – it was formerly called Angkor Soul because of her husband’s record store downstairs – served takeaways during the pandemic. Sok says: “The supply chain has been horrible. I spent days driving round, looking for products.” Dishes include cha kroeung, a curry with lemongrass, galangal and turmeric, and loc lac, a French colonised dish. Growing up among Cambodian refugees, in Boston, then Los Angeles, where she would cater dinner parties and small weddings, food provided comfort for Sok’s community. Kambuja returned her to her roots. “As an immigrant kid, I wanted to eat American mac’n’cheese to assimilate,” she says. “I took the Cambodian food my mother cooked for granted. My restaurant brought me back to a place I had been away from for so long.” Cha kroeung chicken (spicy lemongrass stir-fry) Serves 4-5 2 tbsp vegetable oil400g boneless chicken breast or thighs, thinly sliced1 onion, in 1cm-wide slices1 red pepper, stem, seeds and pith discarded, flesh cut into 1cm-thick slices150g green beans, topped, cut in half100g roasted peanuts, roughly chopped1 large handful sweet holy or Thai basilSliced spring onions For the lemongrass paste3 lemongrass stalks, outer leaves removed, roughly chopped6 garlic cloves, peeled3 shallots, peeled6 Thai red or green bird’s eyes chillies (or fewer)2½ cm piece (about 15g) galangal, peeled and sliced, or ginger5 fresh or frozen makrut lime leaves, sliced2 tsp turmeric powder For the seasoning3 tbsp oyster sauce2 tbsp fish sauce2 tbsp palm sugar (or any other sugar or honey)1 tbsp tamarind paste or lime juice Blitz paste ingredients in a blender, adding enough cold water to make a smooth paste.

Add peanuts and, off the heat, basil. Garnish with spring onions; serve with steamed jasmine rice. Buzzrock, 72, and Farida Anderson, 60 Two decades after his parents arrived in the UK with the Windrush generation, Buzzrock came to Britain from Jamaica, in 1976, age 27, holding only a photograph of his mother. Raised by an aunt, Buzzrock (known as Buzz) was the last of his family to emigrate, following his three sisters, once his father – a second world war veteran – had made enough money. Buzz established his name in the shebeens and all-night Caribbean clubs of Manchester’s Moss Side where he met his wife Farida – the daughter of a Somali immigrant, now an MBE – and cooked up a taste of home for the city’s Jamaican community, including the tightly packed dumplings he is named after. Now his cafe, where meat marinates from 6am and punters queue before noon, dishes up 300 plates of island food a day. “Our customers are British, Irish, Asian, Caribbean – 80% are white. It gives me a buzz to see all of them with ‘dem belly full’.” (They sell T-shirts carrying Buzz’s slogan in their online shop.) “Buzz and I have put in a lot of hours to get here,” Farida says. “When they called the area ‘Gunchester’ we’d dodge bullets, serving food from our trailer. We fought for eight years to get our premises, experiencing racism as black shop owners.” The pandemic has had an impact, too. “Meat is 30% more expensive. I spent last summer policing the door, getting people to wear masks and sanitise.” In the shebeen days, Buzz’s cooking fuelled illicit gambling dens and a sideline supplying cannabis. He started the business following a two-year prison sentence for drugs offences and the (now expired) threat of deportation. Farida – later a campaigner for prisoners’ families – fought for him to remain. Now, they employ ex-offenders and prisoners on day release. “We believe in second chances,” Farida says. Thirty years after he started feeding crowds from a gazebo at Manchester’s Caribbean carnival, Buzz is still serving the same jerk recipe, salt fish patties, flavoursome gravy and curried goat (actually lamb, because British palates “don’t like the bones in goat”) in the shop the couple opened in 2007. “Consistency is the thing,” Buzz says. “People say they’ve been to many places but never tried jerk like I make it.” Barbecue jerk chicken with rice and peas Serves 5-6 For the jerk chicken4-6 full chicken legs3-4 tbsp lemon juice or vinegar100g Buzzrocks all-purpose seasoning (Buzzrocks products all available from buzzrockcaribbean.co.uk)Buzzrocks jerk marinade or mild jerk marinade For the rice and peas180g dried kidney beans – rinsed, soaked overnight and drained (you can use tinned beans, but it will affect the flavour)1 small onion, peeled and finely chopped2 spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped1 tbsp garlic paste2 tbsp Buzzrocks all-purpose seasoning4 sprigs thyme1 scotch bonnet chilli2 tsp salt1 tsp pepper400g long-grain rice Rub lemon juice or vinegar all over the chicken, to add flavour, then season lightly with our all-purpose dry rub. Pour the jerk marinade into a large bowl, add the chicken and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or for at least 30 minutes, and bring back to room temperature before grilling. Light your barbecue. Grill the chicken over a medium fire, turning occasionally, for 30-40 minutes, until well browned all over.Put the beans in a large pot, cover with 750ml water and bring to a boil. Stir in the onion, spring onions, garlic paste, all-purpose seasoning, thyme, scotch bonnet (pierce a hole in the chilli – this will stop it splitting and adding too much spice), salt and pepper, then cover and cook gently for about an hour, until the beans are tender. Stir in the rice, cover and simmer over a low heat for another 30 minutes, until cooked. Frederic Berkmiller, 51 “I have seen staffing problems in restaurants for years,” says Frederic Berkmiller, who established a French-Scottish training exchange for young chefs in 2011, long before Brexit and the pandemic triggered an exodus of foreign and casual workers. “Chefs say all the time that they can’t get waiting staff now foreigners have left. We have to build our own ecosystem. Young people brought up on chips, curry sauce and supermarket food will not aspire to cook and work with fresh fish or vegetables they’ve never seen before.” Since lockdown, he has slimmed his staff from 30, across two sites, to six, including chefs who have been with him for years. “The work is hard, so I look after my chefs,” he says. “We’ve been working four days on, three off, for 15 years.” Born in the Loire valley, Berkmiller moved to London in 1988, then to Edinburgh in 2004. He works to a sustainable, “producer to pass” ethos, farming himself and using nearby growers and suppliers for the dishes plated up at his chef’s pass. He serves classic French cuisine from a locally sourced Scottish larder and four-acre garden, employing skills he learned as a teenager. “School didn’t like me and I didn’t like school. At 14, I was sent to live in as an apprentice in a restaurant where food was hunted, picked and cooked on site.” L’Escargot Bleu is an authentic, charming bistro, with a blue frontage and a wood-panelled bar, tablecloths, a blackboard with the day’s menu and large, classic French advertisements on its walls. “I like to cook by my mood,” Berkmiller says. “My dream restaurant would have no menu. Time-intensive beef bourguignon and veal blanquettes are disappearing, but I’m a great defender of classic French cooking – it’s my origin.” Bourguignon of beef cheeks with garniture grand-mère Serves 4-6 4-6 beef cheeksOlive oil, for frying2 tbsp plain flour1 litre demi-glace or good beef stock For the marinade2-3 bottles red wine2 onions, peeled and cut into large dice2 large carrots, peeled and cut into large dice2 celery stalks1 large bouquet garni10 black peppercorns2 generous soup spoons cognacFor the garniture grand-mère2 knobs butter (approx 25g each)200g button mushrooms200g lardons, or diced smoked bacon200g silverskin onions20g caster sugar Plan ahead – marinading can take up to five days. Pour 80% of the wine into a large container, then add the onions, carrots, celery, bouquet garni, peppercorns and cognac. Cover with clingfilm or a lid, and refrigerate for two days. Add the beef cheeks to the marinade and return to the fridge for a further two or three days, turning the meat every day. When the beef has marinated, lift it out of the marinade, keeping the wine and vegetables, put on a tray between two cloths and pat until it is very dry. Heat the oven to 130C (110 fan). Put a splash of olive oil in a large, cast-iron casserole pan on a very high heat, then brown the meat all over, until golden. Lower the heat and sweat the drained vegetables (but not the bouquet garni) from the marinade, until the onions are softened. Return the beef to the pot, sprinkle over the flour, then pour over the marinade juices. Bring to a boil, season, then add the bouquet garni and the demi-glace or stock. Cook in the heated oven for two to three hours. (If you want to add even more flavour, spread the cooking time over two days: cook for one hour on day one, leave to cool, then refrigerate, and cook at the same temperature for another hour the following day. This is how my grandmother always cooked this dish.) When the beef is cooked, it should be almost falling apart. When it gets to this stage, lift it out of the pan and place on a tray. Pass the sauce through a strainer into another pan. Place the pot on the heat, bring the sauce to a boil and reduce until it has a good consistency, thick enough to cover the back of a spoon. Season to taste, then return the meat to the sauce and serve the same day, or cool and refrigerate for a day or two, before reheating. To make the grand-mère garnish, heat the butter and a splash of olive oil in a frying pan, saute the mushrooms until well coloured, then lift out into a bowl. Do the same with the lardons, then put with the mushrooms. Add the silverskin onions and sugar to the hot butter and toss until glazed and golden. Drain, then saute all the garnish ingredients together to heat through. When you are ready to eat, pour the reserved wine into the beef pot and gently bring up to a simmer. Stir in the grand-mère garnish and serve with boiled potatoes such as ratte or pink fir, or an earthy, creamy mashed potato. Alex Nietosvuori, 29 “It can be hard to find a passion for working kitchen hours among local boys and girls,” says Alex Nietosvuori, the Swede behind newly Michelin-starred Hjem, which he established in 2019 with his Northumbrian fiance Ally Thompson, 37; they also run the Hadrian hotel and a gastro pub in the north-east market town. While their fine-dining staff have expanded to a team of eight, lockdown triggered departures elsewhere in the business. “A lot of people are in our industry for convenience or to pay their way through uni,” Thompson says. “They realised there’s probably an easier way to live than working till midnight everyday.” Nietosvuori, who emigrated from Sweden in 2015, is matter of fact. “At the end of the day, if people leave, we don’t need them here,” he says. “We want all of our business to reflect the standards of our restaurant.” It compounded a problem started by Brexit, Thompson adds: “There are no applications from Europeans now. Our last stage [intern], an Italian, left before lockdown. Our two Polish chefs have said the vote made them feel unwelcome. I fear we will see fewer European chefs wanting to open here.” Hjem – both a Norwegian translation and Northumbrian dialect for “home” – sits on the same latitude as Nietosvuori’s native Skåne, in the south of Sweden. The same berries, mushrooms and plants go into the recipes on his tasting menus, including crisp croustades; pearly, white river cod; and the restaurant’s signature horseradish sorbet with spelt crumble and warm apple caramel served inside a wooden apple crafted by Thompson’s father. “In Sweden you can forage on anyone’s land,” Thompson says. “Alex will often be walking the dog and pull containers out from his backpack.” Nietosvuori, whose career began 12 years ago, making pies in Malmö, says: “Our ambition is very simple: to be the best in the country, then the world. Last time we opened bookings, they were gone in two minutes. I couldn’t care less about food when I was young. Now, food is everything.” Baked cod and Northumbrian ’nduja sauce Serves 4 1 cod fillet, around 40cm100g salt, for the brine2 heads of broccoli, washed500g spinach, washed350g butter50g ’nduja (we use Rachel Hammond’s Northumbrian ’nduja)300ml good chicken stock150ml double cream Plan ahead, as the cod needs to go in the fridge for 24 hours. Cut out the thickest part of the fillet and take off the skin; the rest of the fillet – the thinner part – is perfect for fish and chips later in the week. Measure out 2 litres of water, add 100g salt and whisk to dissolve. Put the cod in the brine and soak in the fridge for 24 hours. Next day, lift out and pat dry the fish, then place on clingfilm and roll into a sausage shape, twisting the ends to keep it as tight as possible. Wrap in foil to make a cylindrical shape. Bake at 110C, then remove and put it straight into ice water – still wrapped – to cool it down and stop any further cooking, then refrigerate overnight. The next day, slice the cod into 2cm-thick portions. Cook the broccoli in boiling water for about 10 minutes, adding the spinach for the last 30 seconds, then strain, put in a blender with 100g of the butter and blitz to a smooth puree (you might need to add a little water), then refrigerate. In a frying pan, sweat off the ’nduja without colouring it, to release some of the aromas, then add the chicken stock and reduce by half. Stir in the remaining 250g butter and blitz it all together. Put the slices of cod on a baking try and heat gently in a 150C oven for about three minutes, until just warm. In a pan, warm up the broccoli puree. In a separate pan, warm up your ’nduja sauce. Put a slice of cod in the base of four shallow bowls, top with a tablespoon of broccoli puree, pour over 2 tbsp of the warm sauce and serve. San Wong, 69, and his sons Charlie, 44, and Michael, 42 Charlie’s father, San, was 16 when he left Tai Po, Hong Kong, with his parents. “We couldn’t make a living in the New Territories,” San says. “My father left first; I followed six months later.” His 70-cover Chinese restaurant, situated on Stranmillis Road in Belfast, bills itself as the longest established in Northern Ireland (the first Welcome opened in Portadown in 1973; it switched location to the Belfast site in 1982) and passed to his sons, Charlie and Michael, five years ago. “We still use sauces from Tai Po, but the pandemic has hit the supply chain hard,” Charlie says. “People are stockpiling imported ingredients. You have to buy up what you can from Chinese supermarkets. Consistency is important.” During the Troubles, San stayed, while other families left. “Many Indian and Italian restaurants closed. Those were dark days, but they presented an opportunity to make our name. As an Asian family, we would be waved through road blocks while both sides of the city fought. “Today we have families who’ve been coming for three generations. I’ve turned away rock stars and politicians to honour bookings from my regulars.” Steamed mussels in black bean sauce Serves 1-2 1 spring onion, trimmed1 chilli (red or green)300g dry black beans50ml cooking oil (vegetable is fine but not olive), plus 10-20ml extra to finish100g sugar30g salt20ml light soy sauce10ml dark soy sauce50g garlic, peeled and minced (or garlic paste)7-10 frozen New Zealand mussels, in the half shell Cut the spring onion into thin strips, and slice the chillies into thin rounds, then set aside. Use a spoon to mash the black beans in a bowl. Put the oil into a pan on a low heat, then add the beans, sugar, salt, both soy sauces and garlic, stir to combine and cook slowly until they form a smooth paste. Take off the heat and set aside to cool. Put a steamer pan on to boil. Put the mussels on a plate and put a teaspoon of the black bean paste on each one. As soon as steam comes out from the steamer, put in the mussel plate, cover the steamer and leave to cook for seven to eight minutes, just until the flesh is bouncy, not squishy. To finish, heat 10-20ml cooking oil in a pan. Scatter the chopped spring onion and chilli on top of the mussels and, once the oil is hot, pour it all over the top so everything sizzles (this will add a sheen to the dish, too). Sprinkle over a drizzle of dark soy sauce, to add colour, and serve hot. Nand Kishor, 47 The pandemic dealt the worst possible blow to staff at Dastaan who lost their senior chef, Balam Singh, to Covid last January. “He was my right-hand man, my friend, we miss him terribly,” says chef-owner Nand Kishor Semwal, born in Dehradun, in the Himalayan foothills. Half of his 22 employees were taken ill over Christmas 2020. The 52-cover restaurant, born of a friendship between Semwal and co-owner Sanjay Gour, both former head chefs at the Michelin-starred Gymkhana in London (where Singh also worked), is operating at 30 covers with a delivery driver, post-pandemic. “We’re lucky – our staff have been here for years, but I’m paying £2-3 more per kilo of lamb, and a box of chillis is up 50%.” The name Dastaan is taken from the Urdu for fable or tale. The unassuming shopfront on a Surrey high street belies a vibrant, talked-about and beautifully plated menu served in simple surrounds. Semwal moved to England, for work, in 2003, having cooked in Mumbai’s best kitchens. His lamb chops with mustard relish remind him of the meat his mother and grandmother prepared. “I cook the food I ate at home in north India and cooked in kitchens in the south. I was always fascinated by food. My dream came true.” Lamb chops Serves 2 4 thick lamb chops50g melted butter, to serve For the first marinade2-3 x 4cm pieces ginger, unpeeled and bashed to bruise45g ginger and garlic paste5g ground kasuri methi7½g salt40g Kashmiri chilli powder25ml lemon juice45ml mustard oil For the second marinade200g Greek yoghurt, strained20g ginger and garlic paste5g ground kasuri methi40g Kashmiri chilli powder15g garam masala Plan ahead as the marinades take two days. Put the lamb in a container in which it will sit in one layer and add all the ingredients for the first marinade. Toss to coat, rub the marinade into the meat with your hands, then refrigerate for at least 12-18 hours. Next day, combine all the ingredients for the second marinade and again rub into the lamb, then refrigerate for six to 12 hours. Heat the oven to 170/180C (150/160 fan). Thread the chops on to skewers, passing them through each one two or three times, to secure. Roast for nine or 10 minutes, then turn and cook for four minutes. Remove, drizzle with melted butter and serve. Yeshi Jampa, 42 “We need more staff but we know it’s not a good time,” says Yeshi Jampa, who started up his canteen-style restaurant in November 2020, after six years serving up east Tibetan soul food at fairs and festivals, including Glastonbury. “There aren’t enough skilled workers around, or the time to train them.” Jampa and his wife, Julie, opened Taste Tibet’s distinctive blue front door, on a residential street, mid-pandemic. “It’s been really hard,” he says. “Suppliers didn’t want to come for our relatively small orders. I was going round shops buying chicken.” Their kitchen is open Wednesday to Saturday, with five employees, including staff from Tibet and Timor-Leste. “With more people, we’d be able to be open more often,” says Julie, who met her husband while working in India. Jampa had a semi-nomadic upbringing, followed by an accidental immigration. At 19, he crossed the Himalayas to help his brother join an Indian monastery. “I walked for 24 days. The journey was so hard, it was 17 years before I returned home.” He met Julie and moved to Oxford, where she worked, in 2011. “I’d never seen food covered in plastic or sold in such small quantities,” he says. Photographs of the mountainsides where he grew up, rearing yaks and cattle in summer and storing produce for winter, decorate the brick walls of his restaurant. The queue for his steamed momo dumplings hasn’t dissipated since he first pitched up on Gloucester Green market, in Oxford, in 2014. During lockdown, they used their premises, and customer donations, to send food to frontline workers and vulnerable people. A cookbook, Taste Tibet, follows on 17 March. Jampa says: “My driving force is to educate people about Tibet; food is a big part of that. Our canteen is a place where a rich man can eat the same food as a poor man. Being a refugee influences that. Where I grew up, the signs in schools said ‘Others before self’. That ethos, karma, is important in Tibet.” Heavenly vegan momos Makes 40 For the dough500g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting (or buy ready-made dumpling wrappers at a good Chinese supermarket) For the filling1 small sweetheart cabbage, about 500g, finely chopped200g spinach, finely chopped2 tsp salt2 tbsp cooking oil200g Chinese chives, finely choppedFor the dough, put the flour in a large bowl and slowly pour in about 250ml of warm water, while mixing it in with your other hand, to make a not-too-sticky dough. Knead until it forms a ball, cover and set aside for 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling. Put the cabbage and spinach in a bowl, add the salt and oil, squish it through the vegetables (to draw out excess moisture), then set aside for five minutes. Tip the vegetables into a colander and press down firmly to drain off as much liquid as possible. Return the vegetable mixture to the bowl and stir in the chives. Knead the dough again for a minute to ensure it’s soft and smooth, then divide it into four, and cover to stop it drying out. Sprinkle a little flour on a work surface, but don’t overdo it – too much can stiffen the dough. Roll one piece of dough into a 25cm-long sausage shape, then cut into 10 equal slices, lightly flattening each one with your hand. Using a rolling pin, and making one wrapper at a time, push and pull the flattened piece of dough up and down quickly and firmly, holding it with your spare hand and turning it as you go, until it’s the size of your palm with the centre a bit thicker than the outer edges; it doesn’t need to be a perfect circle. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Lay a wrapper on a chopping board, spoon a tablespoon of filling into the centre, gently fold one side of the circle over the filling to meet the other side and, starting in the middle, use your fingertips to press the edges together. (If you’re using shop-bought wrappers, you’ll need to wet the edges before sealing.) If the momo is not completely sealed, the juices will escape during steaming, so ensure there are no gaps. Place the filled momo on a lined baking tray, cover with a tea towel, then repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling; keep the filled momos at least 1cm apart, covered with the tea towel to stop them drying out. If you’re using a metal steamer, lightly brush each basket with oil or line with greaseproof paper; if you’re using a bamboo one, line with greaseproof paper. The water in the base of the steamer, or in a wok, should be boiling when the baskets go in. Steam the momos in batches (and depending on the size of your steamer) over a high heat for 13-16 minutes. To test whether they’re ready, press gently: if the dough doesn’t stick to your finger, they’re done. Serve with chilli dips. Jude Kereama, 48 The last two years have given hospitality workers time to take stock, according to Jude Kereama: “I think a lot have really enjoyed being at home with their families. That’s had a big impact on attitudes towards working in this industry. I’m lucky to have had loyalty from mine.” He employs 10 people across his two restaurants on Porthleven’s Harbour Head. “Brexit and the pandemic have also taught us we must change the way we cook. Fish prices are four times what they should be. It’s no longer sustainable to demand overfishing and huge pieces of cheap meat on meals.” Born in New Zealand to a Māori father and Chinese-Malay mother, Kereama has seen a lot of changes in the Cornish food scene. “When we moved here, everything around us was pubs. My menu was a culture shock.” After rising through the ranks of New Zealand hospitality, he came to England on a two-year working visa, aged 24, and fell in love with his restaurant manager wife, Jane. They converted a west Cornwall boat shed into Kota in 2006, and opened family-friendly Kota Kai in 2011. Jane died of cancer in 2019. His Kota menu pays homage to his childhood. Soft-shell crab in a bao bun, with Asian slaw and seaweed mayo, is a bestseller. “My siblings and I would catch blue swimmer crabs on Waikanae beach,” he says. “Mum would throw them in chilli paste and we’d dip in white bread and butter.” Tempura oyster, served at the restaurant, is inspired by the taste of his dad’s battered oyster, enjoyed with fish and chips every Friday, on the beach back home. “In New Zealand, everyone had an abundance of garden veg and fruit trees. We’d harvest everything. Dad taught us bushcraft and foraging. Mum brought Malaysia’s fusion flavours and had an open-door policy. Friends would walk past at 6pm, knowing they’d get an invite to dinner,” says Kereama, a finalist on the BBC show Great British Menu, whose dream is to cook for the Queen. “Immigration is about following a dream. I try to give people my soul food, something that comes from my upbringing, my journey, and no one else’s.” Singapore crab bao bun Seves 4 as a starter For the soft-shell crab4 soft-shell crabs200ml buttermilk1 tbsp Sichuan pepper1 tbsp Cornish sea salt250g plain flour For the bao buns (makes 24, which can be frozen once cooked)3g dried yeast170ml warm water25g sugar1/2 tsp vegetable oil1/4 tsp baking powder1/4 tsp baking soda1/2 tsp salt300g strong flourVegetable oil for brushing For the Singapore chilli sauce10 large dried red chillies, rehydrated, deseeded and diced (I like Sichuan long-dried chilli)5 serrano chillies, diced1 tbsp shrimp paste, roasted for 5 minutes1 thumb of galangal, diced1 stick lemongrass, diced1 banana shallot, peeled and diced3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed1 tbsp finely chopped ginger25ml vegetable oil3 tbsp tomato ketchup1 tbsp black bean sauce1 tbsp sugar¼ tsp salt3 spring onions, trimmed and chopped2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander For the Asian slaw100g chopped Chinese cabbage100g carrot, julienned or grated into matchsticks3 spring onions, trimmed and chopped6-7 tbsp (25g) chopped fresh coriander4 tbsp mirin1 tbsp brown muscovado sugar60ml rice-wine vinegar1 tsp golden sesame oil1 tsp light soy sauce1 lime, juiced For the seaweed mayo2 sheets nori200g mayonnaiseJuice of ½ lemon To garnish12 slices cucumberCoriander micro-cress (or large picked coriander leaves)1 lime, cut into wedges For the deep-fried soft-shell crab, soak the crabs in the buttermilk. Toast the Sichuan pepper in a frying pan for about a minute, then let it cool down. Grind the pepper with the salt, then season the flour. When needed, take each crab and let the excess buttermilk drip off, then dredge in the flour to coat. Deep-fry (at 180C if you can measure temperature) until crispy. For the bao buns, mix the yeast, water, sugar and vegetable oil in a mixing bowl and leave to react. Mix all the other dry ingredients together. When the yeast is activated, add everything together to make a dough. Knead for a good 10 minutes, then cover with a damp cloth and leave in a warm place to prove for about 1 1/2 hours. Knock the dough back and divide into about 24 even balls. Leave to prove for another 30 minutes. In the meantime, cut out 24 greaseproof paper squares (approx 10x10cm). When the dough balls are ready, roll them out into ovals. Take an oiled chopstick and place in the middle of the ovals, fold over the ovals to make a bao shape, then withdraw the chopstick. Place on the greaseproof paper and let them rise for another 30 minutes. When ready, steam the buns in batches for 10 minutes. For the Singapore chilli sauce, mix the chillies, shrimp paste, galangal and lemongrass, then blend to a paste. Saute the shallot, garlic and ginger in the vegetable oil until golden. add the chilli paste, ketchup, black bean sauce, sugar and salt, then take off the heat and stir in the spring onions and coriander. For the Asian slaw, put the cabbage, carrot, spring onions and coriander in a bowl. Combine the remaining slaw ingredients to make the dressing, whisk, then toss through the chopped vegetables. For the seaweed mayo, dry the nori in a cool oven until very crisp, then blitz to a powder. Season the mayonnaise with the lemon juice, then mix in ½ tsp of the nori powder. To assemble, open up the bao buns, smear chilli sauce to taste on the base, followed by slices of cucumber and a heap of coleslaw. Lay some crab meat on next, followed by a small dollop of mayo and, if you like it hotter, another smear of chilli sauce on top. Garnish and don’t forget to squeeze the lime over before eating. Beza Berhanu, 44 “My staff are students or mums who need some hours,” says Beza Berhanu, who was 16 when she followed her cousin to the UK. Her vegan restaurant in Elephant & Castle opened six months before the pandemic. During lockdown, locals and her landlord funded cooking for NHS staff, the homeless and those out of work. “When I came here I wanted to do something that helped people. I came for opportunity. Look at me now,” she says. Berhanu grew up in Addis Ababa. Weekends and the winter were spent away from the city, at her grandmother’s, where the table was full of colour – spinach, tomatoes, green beans. “She grew everything you can think of on her land. My grandmother was an Orthodox Christian who knew all the health benefits of vegan food, or what we knew as ‘fasting food’. She was over 100 when she died.” Berhanu studied as a nutritionist in London, and started making juices, then batches of red lentil and spinach, to sell at Camden market. “When I started cooking, all that my grandma taught me came back to me. Ethiopian food was new to my customers – they were full of wonder.” Long queues led to the offer of a 25-seat premises in another part of London, which has all the colour and flavours of her grandmother’s table. In fact a round, Ethiopian-made replica table, crafted from dyed grass and palm leaves, hosts her customers. “In my culture, if you have one meal, you share it with someone. My family would sit around my grandma’s table and tell each other about our day. Now everyone wants to sit at my table. “Sometimes I sit in my kitchen and think: ‘Now people know my culture.’ I still go back home to fill my suitcase with the berbere spice that my mum makes, to use at my restaurant.” Misir wot (spiced red lentils) Serves 2, generously 3 tbsp oil of your choice2 big red onions, peeled and finely diced3 cloves garlic, peeled and finely diced1in piece ginger, minced70g berbere spice mix (from the spice or world food section of big supermarkets) or paprika and cayenne pepper1 tsp black pepper500g red lentilsSalt to tasteFlatbread or injera to serve Place oil in a medium stock pot on a medium-high heat, add onions, garlic and ginger, and cook, stirring, for eight to 10 minutes, until golden brown. Add berbere spice and pepper, and cook, stirring, for five to seven minutes more; turn down heat, if need be, to prevent it catching. Add 250ml cold water and lentils, turn down heat and cook, stirring, for 20-25 mins, until it turns thick. Simmer for two minutes more, add salt and serve on flatbread (we use Ethiopian injera bread). Antonio Cersosimo, 45 “I wanted to live abroad and being in the EU made that easy,” says Antonio Cersosimo, who was a physics student when he left Italy for Wales in 1999, aged 22, to improve his English. Now he runs one of the country’s best, authentically Italian restaurants, where regulars visit twice a week and the menu uses a mix of local ingredients and Italian imports, including wine, truffle and salami, which are increasingly hard to come by. “The ripple effect of Brexit, coronavirus and the Suez canal blockage has been chaos,” he says. “Prices have gone up. In some cases we’re the only ones in the UK buying from small, family producers, so they simply had to stop exporting to us.” When he opened in 2005, it marked a departure from the garlic bread and lasagne served in Wales’s Italian cafes. “I’d never had garlic bread in my life. In my grandparents’ village in Calabria, we ate polenta or risotto. In Milan, where I was raised, my mother made her own passata and sourdough.” He says successive generations of immigration to the UK have changed attitudes to new cuisines. “When we first opened, I’d put goat and octopus in the bin every week because people wouldn’t try them – now they’re our bestsellers. “I was part of the second wave of immigrants. We came not because we had to but through choice, so we brought a different approach – less need to assimilate. I could make bolder choices with the food I cooked because, if it didn’t work, I could go home.” Ragù di agnello e fave (ragù of Welsh lamb and broad beans) Serves 4 For the ragù1 small onion, peeled and finely diced2 small carrots, trimmed and finely diced3 sticks celery, finely diced1 small leek, trimmed and finely diced1 tsp dried mintExtra-virgin olive oil400g Welsh lamb shoulder, trimmed and cut into small cubes250ml white wine1 large tomato, peeled and roughly chopped400g broad beans, shelled (or frozen and defrosted) For the gremolata butter30 fresh mint leavesZest of 1 orange1 clove garlic, peeled100g unsalted butter, at room temperature To finish400g orecchietteGrated pecorino If possible, make the ragù the day before and store it in the fridge, because it improves the flavour. In a thick-based saucepan or casserole dish, saute the chopped onion, carrot, celery, leek and dried mint, stirring often, for five minutes. Meanwhile, fry the lamb cubes in a frying pan, in extra-virgin olive oil, in batches if need be, until nicely coloured, then add to the vegetable pan. Deglaze the lamb pan with the wine, then pour over the meat, add the tomato and cook very gently for an hour and a half, until the lamb is very tender. (If the meat looks as if it’s drying out too much, add a little water.) Finely chop the fresh mint, orange zest and garlic clove for the gremolata, then stir into the soft butter. In a large saucepan, bring five litres of salted water to a rapid boil, add the pasta and cook for at least two minutes less than the stated cooking time – for this recipe, you want it very al dente. Drain the pasta, reserving a little of the cooking water, then return the pasta to the saucepan, pour in the ragu and broad beans, and cook gently, stirring, on a low heat for two to three minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the gremolata butter. Serve in large pasta bowls, topped with the grated pecorino and a generous drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Stosie Madi, 51 At the height of summer, pre-Brexit and pre-pandemic, Stosie Madi’s multi award-winning pub would cook for 300 people over a weekend, opening six days a week. This summer’s staffing shortage has halved their week and their capacity. “It is heartbreaking. We could still be cooking for those numbers – we have the demand – but we don’t have the staff. After being closed for 18 months, we have not been able to capitalise on the boom that followed.” With no local transport, and based in a wealthy hamlet where teenagers are not looking for work, Madi has relied heavily on staff from eastern Europe, often living on site. Her four core staff are Brits and one Romanian, who has been there for four years. “Brexit has been a nightmare. It stripped that workforce away. If something doesn’t change drastically, I can’t see how independent restaurants can survive.” Madi describes herself as a “French-born Gambian with Lebanese origins”. She was born at the end of colonial rule in West Africa and followed her parents into hospitality, opening a jazz club in her 20s, then a restaurant. The political situation forced them out when her daughter Laudy (now head waiter at Simon Rogan’s L’Enclume in Cartmel) was 10. “We witnessed defenceless children being shot at in front of us. Seeing poverty around us worsen, people disappearing, friends and colleagues threatened or jailed for political opinions was the last straw.” Rural Lancashire, the home of her long-standing friend and business partner Kathy Smith, became an unlikely new start and a culinary success. Its location, in the Forest of Bowland, was pivotal when they took on the Parkers Arms in 2007: “We wanted to cook food from the land around us, to be self-sufficient.” Citrus is one of their only imports and everything from ice-creams to bread, chutneys and pies is prepared on site: “I dream in ingredients. My cooking draws from my multinational background and my new, British one. One dish always on my menu is a pie – a dish from Middle Eastern culture, made with northern veg and the same pastry recipe I ate at school in Africa. Yet what could feel more British?” Beetroot, beet leaves and herb fatayer Makes 4 large pies 1 bunch beetroot with 3-4 beets and vibrant leaves1 small bunch coriander, roughly chopped1 small bunch mint, leaves picked and left whole1 small bunch thyme, leaves picked1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped4 large garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped2 red chillies, finely chopped (pith and seeds discarded for less heat)1 large red onion, peeled and finely sliced1 tbsp ground cumin For the dough375g wholewheat stoneground flour1 tsp salt50ml rapeseed oil125g warm water100g live sourdough (or 7.5g instant dried yeast or 15g live yeast) Pick the beetroots off the bunch, reserving the stalks and leaves. Cover beets with cold water, bring to a boil, then simmer until soft but still holding their shape. Drain, leave to cool, then peel, chop and put aside. Mix the flour and salt in a bowl, add oil and rub through. Pour the warm water on to the sourdough starter, stir gently to dissolve, then pour into the flour mix and bring together into a ball. Cover with a cloth and leave in a warm place for 30-60 minutes until doubled in size. Turn out and knead for five to 10 minutes (or work for five minutes in a food processor with a dough hook). Put in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean cloth and leave in a warm place overnight, until doubled in volume. (The dough can now be frozen for up to three months; just defrost before using.) Toss all the filling ingredients together well, check seasoning and allow to sit for 30 minutes to wilt the herbs and leaves, and create a sauce. Stir well and proceed to fill the pies. Gently deflate dough before portioning. For four large pies, divide into 160g balls (65g balls for 10 small pies), then cover with lightly oiled greaseproof paper. Roll dough into circles on a lightly floured surface. Place a spoonful of filling in the middle. Bring two sides together and pinch to close. Bring the third side up so it looks like a triangle and pinch shut. (You can freeze at this stage for up to three months; bake straight from frozen following the method below, but add 5-8 mins baking time.) To bake, brush lightly with rapeseed oil, sprinkle with sesame seeds and sea salt (optional) and place on lightly oiled nonstick trays, then bake in a pre-heated oven at 200C (180 fan) for 10-12 mins, until golden brown and crisp. (The pies can be frozen for up to three months; just defrost and reheat until crisp.) Delicious hot or cold, with whipped tahini or spicy tomato sauce and a crisp salad. Sera Gurung, 58 Sera Gurung opened Yak Yeti Yak with his wife, Sarah, 18 years ago to satisfy his desire for an authentic taste of home. He grew up in Armala, northern Nepal, without electricity or tap water. “Fresh vegetables grew outside and we kept buffalo and goats. My siblings and I would watch our mother cook on the open fire in the middle of the house.” Meat was a luxury and pork was forbidden. “As a boy, I’d travel to get it, then cook it on a fire by myself. It is still my favourite dish on my menu.” Gurung was studying business in London when he met Sarah in 1989. They returned to Nepal together for five years, before settling in the UK. At Yak Yeti Yak, tucked away in the basement of three Georgian townhouses, their core team has been with them more than a decade, serving customers on floor cushions, under walls adorned with rice dollies, fish traps, nets and Nepalese art. At this point in the pandemic, Sarah says, they are still in survival mode. “A few younger, newer staff liked furlough too much,” she says. Young employees saved their wages in lockdown and left when it was time to reopen. “Finding new staff to replace them and extra staff to keep up with Covid sanitation is difficult,” she adds. This has limited their capacity. Gurung says: “I’ve had people travel to Nepal after eating here, then come back to tell me my food is better. One Michelin chef sends his kitchen porter for takeaway at the end of his shift. In our culture, a guest is like a god, to be respected. To hear they love the food of my home country feels wonderful.” Pork belly bhutuwa Serves 4 with rice, dal and a vegetable dish, or a generous 2 with just rice 450g pork belly strips1 medium onion, peeled1 tomato3-4 spring onions60ml rapeseed or vegetable oil1 tbsp ginger, finely grated½ tbsp garlic, finely grated2 ½ tsp Kathmandu masala (thehimalayanspice company.com) or garam masala1 tsp salt60ml water Cut pork into 3cm squares. Cut onion into quarters from tip to root. Roughly chop tomato. Trim and cut spring onions into 4cm lengths. Heat oil in a large, heavy-based pan or wok until shimmering, then stir-fry pork belly until browned all over. Add onion, ginger and garlic, fry, stirring, until the onion is translucent, add the masala and salt, and cook for up to a minute, until the spices start sticking to the bottom of the pan. Add water, stir to lift any bits stuck to the bottom and reduce the heat to medium. Cover and cook until the pork is cooked through (it should give off lots of juice; if not, add 60ml more water). Remove the lid, return heat to high and cook until liquid evaporates, pork sizzles and the juices caramelise on the bottom of the pan. Stir and scrape the caramel to prevent it burning; as soon as you have difficulty scraping the caramel from the pan, stir in the tomato, which will lift it as it cooks. Add spring onions, cook long enough to soften slightly, then taste for salt, adjust and serve. This is a lovely, rich curry that goes well with fried rice, pilau rice or flatbread. As with most Nepalese curries, it is dry; for gravy, add 250ml water and 2 tbsp light soy sauce with the spring onions, and stir well. Ghofran Hamza, 23 “I didn’t even have time to switch on the kitchen equipment before the pandemic hit,” says Ghofran Hamza, a refugee of the Syrian war who planned to open Aberystwyth’s first Arabic restaurant in March 2020. When she did eventually open the doors, a year later, 200 people queued to eat there. “I will never forget that day,” she says. After leaving her home, in north-east Syria, for Lebanon in 2012, Hamza’s family relied on UN food parcels. “When war started, we would go out and never know if we’d make it home,” she says. “In Lebanon, we went a long time without work. The house we were in wasn’t fit for animals.” They were given a home in the UK in 2018. Hamza cooked with her mother and brother (she also has two younger siblings) to raise money for refugee families. “There is a Syrian community here of about eight families. We wanted to buy children clothes and send them on summer activities. The town loved our food.” A restaurant was never part of the plan. “But Mum and I walked past a place for rent and called the landlord. He kept rates low for us. People warned me that running a business when we’d been here just a few months would be too much for a young woman, but I saw a chance to create something.” Hamza is studying for a degree in international politics and Spanish while running the restaurant. She employs two staff – one local person and one student. “Locally, there were many people looking for work but to find someone who has grown up eating or cooking the same food is hard,” she says. “As a girl, I would watch my mum prepare stuffed vine leaves from scratch. When we moved here, she taught me how to cook. Now you can’t tell the difference between her food and mine. “In Lebanon, I went without food; now I cook for others. My journey has come full circle. It’s hard to think of my friends back home, but when I cook, it’s a little bit of the food we shared.” Stuffed vine leaves Serves 6 1 large jar (908g) vine leaves in brine (you can get them at any Middle Eastern food shop; the quality makes a big difference to the dish, so get the best you can afford – I use California Gardens) For the filling420g short-grain rice100g parsley, finely chopped6 tomatoes, finely chopped2 big onions, peeled and finely chopped, or 1 bunch spring onions, finely chopped5 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped60ml olive oil or vegetable oil For the spice mixYou can use any spices you wish, but the essentials are:2 tbsp tomato paste1 tsp black pepper2 tsp citric acid, or the juice of 4 lemons1 tbsp salt In additionEnough discs of sliced tomato, potato and onion to line your pan (around four slices for a medium pan) Put all the filling ingredients in a bowl and stir to mix. Before adding the spice mix, try some so you know whether to adjust the flavour by adding more lemon or salt. It should be a bit salty and sour. Combine the filling with most of the spice mix, leaving a little spice back for later. Drain and wash the vine leaves. Lay a leaf soft side down on a board, with the hard side facing up. Spoon the same amount of filling into each leaf, then fold it in at the sides first before rolling it up like a wrap. (The process is quite time-consuming.) At the bottom of a large, heavy pot, put slices of tomatoes, potatoes or any vegetables you like to prevent the leaves from burning, then cover with a layer of stuffed vine leaves. Add the remaining spice mixture at the bottom of the pot or between each layer of vine leaves to retain flavour. Repeat in layers until all the vine leaves are in the pot. Add water to cover and seal with a plate (you might want to place something heavy on top to keep it in place). Bring up to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and leave to cook for at least an hour. If they are soft, they are ready; if not, cook for up to 30 minutes more, then serve at room temperature, to six people as a main dish, 12 as a side. Roberto Alvarado Rios, 71 In autumn, a competitor walked in and tried to poach the Spanish staff at Mestizo, a bright, cosy restaurant and tequila bar in Camden, near Regent’s Park in London. “I was shocked,” says owner Marysol Alvarado. “I would never do that. It shows how desperate the industry is. We had already lost staff from the floor, the kitchen. They left because of the pandemic and never returned because of Brexit. Every restaurant owner is struggling.” Marysol and husband Roberto came to the UK from a restaurant background in Tecamachalco, central Mexico, in 1997 and opened Si Señor, in Soho, with an ambition to deliver traditional cuisine to Brits. In 2001, though, they were forced to close when the rent went up. The pandemic threatened financial ruin again – the family put their entire savings into keeping their restaurant, and the Mexican market next door, going. “The supply chain has been menacing,” Marysol says. “The customer may never feel this, and perhaps gets mad about not being able to get served their favourite tipple, but certain food and drink items are just not available any more.” Now the lively, 80-cover spot is thriving again, thanks to loyal locals and a solid reputation – a favourite dish is mole poblano (meat in a chocolate and chilli sauce). “Our menus are inspired by all parts of Mexico, by my mother and mother-in-law,” Marysol explains. “We are not fancy, but we are ambassadors for the food, flavours, colours of home. When Mexicans come to eat here, they remember when their grannies cooked for them: Mi casa es su casa.” Chicken enchiladas Serves 2 300g chicken breast1 bowl (size to your liking) cooked whole black beansCooked rice (amount to your liking)A little olive or vegetable oil4 corn tortillas (2 per serving)300ml salsa verde for enchiladas (ready made from mestizomarket.com) Roast or poach the chicken with your preferred seasoning and/or spices, then shred. Heat the beans and rice, ready to be served as sides. Once done, grease a pan with oil and put on a high heat. When the oil is hot, soften the tortillas by dipping them in for five seconds (use tongs), taking care not to leave them too long, as they will go crisp and won’t fold easily. In another pan, warm the salsa verde. Stuff the tortillas with the shredded chicken, roll to enclose the filling, then cover in the hot salsa verde.

1/22/2022,"As has often been the case in the past, England’s biggest selection conundrum for the Six Nations comes in midfield. The absence of Owen Farrell and Manu Tuilagi gives Eddie Jones the opportunity to try something different. He has the chance to develop his ‘New England’ a step further and perhaps even implement a different style that will remain in place until the World Cup next year. Eddie won’t address the fact Farrell and Tuilagi are missing with the squad in great detail on Monday when they assemble in Brighton. It can be disheartening to feel like you are just standing in for someone or keeping the jersey warm and I do wonder if, in Tuilagi’s case, that has been a problem in the past. He is such a valuable asset when fit and firing – and so popular with his teammates – that it has felt as if anyone who has worn the No 13 jersey has struggled to make it their own as a result.  For this Six Nations, I would like to see Jack Nowell deployed there. He has only done it once before for England – the ill-fated match against Japan in the autumn of 2018 that effectively ended the Test careers of Danny Care, Alex Lozowski and Zach Mercer – but I believe it is time to take another look. It is incredible to think that Nowell has only made five appearances and three starts for England since then but that is indicative of the problems he has had with injuries and getting back to his best form amid so many interruptions. It has been well documented how he has decided to stop drinking alcohol, how he looks and feels in his best shape for ages, and it is showing on the pitch. On top of that, Eddie is putting great emphasis on versatility at the moment. He has talked in the past – perhaps ever so slightly tongue in cheek – about Nowell playing as a flanker but the point he was getting at was how unique a skillset he possesses. As Eddie alluded to in the autumn, we can get hung up on numbers on jerseys a bit too much but playing Nowell at 13 gives him the platform to bring the best out of himself. He is such a rare talent because he has all the fundamentals that a top all-round rugby player needs. He has an incredible appetite for work, gets through so many involvements and has an excellent rugby brain. He’s not just a great rugby athlete, he’s a great rugby player as well. He’s strong, consistent, there are very few mistakes in his game but also that bit of sparkle, an X factor, which gets me excited about what he may be able to do. While Ollie Lawrence and Dan Kelly have fulfilled the role of direct-running outside-centre in the absence of Tuilagi in recent times, I would love to see Nowell given the chance this tournament. That in turn allows Henry Slade to be the ball-playing No 12 outside Marcus Smith that Eddie clearly wants. He feels the need to have a second pair of eyes and ears but Slade did that superbly well against South Africa and he and Nowell would not need introduction in midfield. To go back to Eddie’s point on versatility. It’s an interesting one because as well as Nowell, he has picked Luke Northmore, Joe Marchant, Max Malins, Freddie Steward and even Orlando Bailey, who can all fill in at different positions. In the past such versatility has counted against players in Six Nations and autumn campaigns, but helps when it comes to World Cup selection because whereas England were able to select 36 players this week, it will be 33 at France 2023. Eddie seems to be trying to get ahead of the curve in that respect. Looking at the squad on the whole, what excites me the most is not so much the personnel, but more the style of players Eddie has picked. I understand the disappointment that some supporters have when George Ford is not included, or Sam Underhill, who has been so important defensively in the past, but look at the players chosen ahead of them in those positions. Ford’s absence allows Smith to develop at fly-half and without Underhill, it looks as if Alex Dombrandt, Sam Simmonds or Alfie Barbeary may get a shot at No 8 and that again points to a more adventurous outlook. I do have some frustrations. I can’t understand why Adam Radwan played against Tonga but not Australia and South Africa and now finds himself on the outside looking in after two caps. Granted the talent pool in England is huge and Eddie will want to look at as many players as possible but that suggests to me that there is either something wrong with the talent identification or something about the environment that did not enable Radwan to flourish. Of course, it can also be down to the player, maybe Eddie has decided that he is not at the required international standard yet but if there is similar turnover in the summer and autumn it will be a concern considering there will be just 12 matches before World Cup preparations begin after this Six Nations. Much of it is ultimately down to the players to maintain their form but equally the coaches need to implement a consistency of selection and style to ensure England hit the ground running at France 2023.",Sport/Sport,Jack Nowell should be given another chance to shine for England at No 13 | Ugo Monye,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/22/jack-nowell-should-be-given-another-chance-to-shine-for-england-at-no-13
1/22/2022,"In the 112 years since it began, the Electric cinema in Birmingham has lived through the history of film-making. When it first opened its doors in 1909 it showed silent movies with a piano backing, rolling newsreels and cartoons in the 30s, adult films in the 60s, and blockbusters in the 80s. But the Covid pandemic nearly marked the end of what is believed to be the UK’s oldest working cinema when its owners decided to sell up after more than a year of continuous closure.  “It was the biggest existential crisis the industry has faced ever. The only time cinemas were forced by law to close was the first two weeks of world war two. So to be closed for 10 months was horrific,” said Kevin Markwick, the cinema’s new owner, who has brought the venue back to life, opening its doors on Friday for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Markwick, who also owns an independent cinema in East Sussex, was approached last year by the previous owners to see if he would consider saving the venue. It was the first time he had visited Birmingham, but he took one look at the traditional movie theatre with its art deco frontage and decided to buy it. “There is so much potential here. We can build something really special,” he said. When he announced the news on social media, he was overwhelmed by the response from people who feared the cinema had disappeared for ever, and the first screenings on Friday quickly sold out. A lot of work has gone on behind the scenes to get the cinema back in working order, including replacing all the digital cinema equipment – “It does not like being turned off,” Markwick said – and bringing the vintage 35mm projector back to life. He has plans to improve the venue further and enhance its classic aesthetic, including installing curtains in front of the screen. “I want it to be an old-school cinema experience,” he said. “It’s important to maintain that heritage, that through-line all the way from Charlie Chaplin through Errol Flynn to Marilyn Monroe, to Rex Harrison, to Arnold Schwarzenegger, to now.” The first film on the schedule is Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast, followed by an eclectic lineup including Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story and one of Markwick’s personal favourites, Billy Wilder’s 1960 romantic comedy The Apartment. “I want to programme it with a mixture of mainstream, art house, old films. Basically, I want to make it a go-to place for film lovers in Birmingham,” he said. When the Electric first opened on 27 December 1909, it was Birmingham’s first cinema and showed mostly American silent movies before adding sound in 1930. Much of the original building was rebuilt in 1937, and it reopened as a rolling news theatre, the Tatler. The cinema was rebranded again in the 1960s as the Jacey, mostly showing cartoons, and began showing adult films at the end of the decade to combat declining audiences. It went through various owners throughout the 1980s, before reverting to the Electric in 1993. While the pandemic has been tough for the cinema industry, Markwick is confident the success of blockbusters such as No Time to Die and the latest Spider-Man offering shows the appetite for cinema is as strong as ever. “We were hit hard during the pandemic by being forced to close and the studios going off with indecent haste to streaming, leaving us feeling like jilted lovers,” he said. “There was always this slight worry that we’d been abandoned by the film distributors, but obviously they’ve realised what side their bread is buttered on.” After a hectic few months preparing the cinema for the return of audiences, Markwick said he can’t wait to see a packed house for the first showing. “I’m as comfortable in a cinema as I am in my own front room. I’ve grown up around cinema and so have my children,” said Markwick, whose daughter Katie will be running the venue full-time. “Like me, she started working as an usher from about 16 years old. We love cinema and know all about it and, hopefully, we know what we’re doing.”",News/UK news,‘Go-to place for film lovers’: Birmingham’s Electric cinema reopens,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/22/go-to-place-for-film-lovers-birminghams-electric-cinema-reopens
1/22/2022,"Taiwan has reported a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases with a cluster among workers at a factory threatening authorities’ tenuous control of an Omicron outbreak on the eve of Lunar New Year. On Saturday, Taiwan’s centre for disease control reported 82 domestic cases, including 63 found at the Taoyuan factory in a first round of testing on Friday. Most of those sick are migrant workers, health and welfare minister Chen Shih-chung said.  Taiwan maintains strict controls on its borders, with the few eligible entrants sent into 14 days of quarantine, seven days of self-managed semi-isolation, and multiple tests. With Omicron sweeping around the world, larger numbers of positive cases have been reported among new arrivals, despite requirements for a negative test before boarding departure flights. In recent weeks authorities have responded to clusters in Taoyuan connected to the international airport, and another in the southern city of Kaohsiung. Among Saturday’s figures were 14 new cases in the latter cluster, but the CDC said the airport cluster appears to have stabilised after tracing and isolation efforts. Saturday’s figures followed 23 cases reported on Friday, in Taoyuan and Kaohsiung. Taiwan has adopted a zero-Covid strategy in practice, if not formal policy, which has kept the island relatively Covid free for most of the pandemic. Its largest outbreak in the second half of 2021 saw more than 800 died after the Alpha variant infected thousands and a small rural outbreak of Delta infected 17, but it was eventually brought back to zero. In the months since, vaccination rates have increased and booster shots have begun to be rolled out. The capital city Taipei on Friday launched a mandatory vaccine passport for entry into some venues, like bars and clubs. On Saturday the CDC said 73% of migrant workers were vaccinated with two doses. Governments and companies in Taiwan were criticised last year for poor treatment of migrant workers during the outbreak. Thousands were ordered to remain in crowded dorms, which many feared put them at higher risk of contracting Covid-19, and they were subjected to harsher restrictions than local employees who worked along side them. On Saturday, the ministry of labor recommended migrant workers in Taoyuan not go out into the city or Greater Taipei, and said companies which employ 50 or more migrant workers to conduct mass testing. With Lunar New Year holidays beginning next week, authorities urged people to be cautious in mixing with others and travel, but did not impose restrictions. The increased transmissibility of the Omicron variant has challenged the remaining jurisdictions with zero Covid strategies. In nearby Hong Kong authorities found at least 75 community cases at a residential block on Friday, the South China Morning Post reported. Another residential block was placed into a five-day lockdown on Friday after 34 cases were detected. Hong Kong has reintroduced social restrictions and imposed other controversial measures, including ordering the surrender and destruction of more than 2,000 hamsters across the city after 11 were found to be infected at a pet shop where an employee fell ill with Covid. In China, Omicron has been detected in at least seven of the country’s 31 provinces, including several cases in the capital, Beijing. A range of restrictions have been imposed by local authorities, causing some confusion and fear around the possibility of travel during the Lunar New Year period. Authorities in the north-eastern city of Harbin said on Saturday that they will conduct a city-wide exercise to test its roughly 10 million people for Covid from Monday, although it has had no recent cases, calling it an pre-emptive move ahead of the holiday.",News/World news,"Taiwan sees sharp rise in Covid cases, posing risk to Lunar New Year",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/taiwan-sees-sharp-rise-in-covid-cases-posing-risk-to-lunar-new-year
1/22/2022,"As Louise Erdrich’s new novel begins, her heroine, Tookie, has been sentenced to 60 years in prison for an offence both horrible and ridiculous. It’s 2005, and though Tookie is in her 30s, “I still clung to a teenager’s pursuits and mental habits” – drinking and drugging as though she is still an impulsive young adult. Her friend Danae’s lover Budgie has died in the arms of his ex, Mara; Danae persuades Tookie to steal a delivery truck in order to snatch Budgie’s body back. The judge who sends her away to a Minnesota jail is shocked by her crime; Tookie, however, is not surprised by his harshness. “I was on the wrong side of the statistics. Native Americans are the most oversentenced people currently imprisoned,” she says. But while in prison, books are her salvation. Even when she is not permitted to have them, she calls up a library in her head: “everything from the Redwall books to Huck Finn to Lilith’s Brood”. So when she is unexpectedly released in 2015 – her sentence commuted thanks to the tireless efforts of her tribe’s defence lawyer – it is perhaps unsurprising that she finds a job in a Minneapolis bookshop. And here this powerful, endearing novel takes a swerve from its Orange Is the New Black-style opening. It is not Tookie’s term in the savage American carceral system that is the true focus of the book, but her life after her release – a life as ordinary and extraordinary as any, delineated with the care and political acumen that have always distinguished Erdrich’s work, and which won her the Pulitzer prize for her last novel, The Night Watchman.  That book was inspired by the life of her own grandfather, tribal chairman of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, who in the 1950s campaigned tirelessly against the US government’s policy of “termination”, through which Native American tribes would be moved off their land, and the land sold. Over the course of her long and distinguished writing career, beginning with the acclaimed Love Medicine in 1984, Erdrich has charted Indigenous lives in the US in a manner that recalls William Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha County: the creation of a fictional universe centred in lived reality and experience. Her books always run right up against the politics of the present, and The Sentence has an almost shocking immediacy, set as it is against the background of the Covid-19 pandemic and the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, where Erdrich lives. And Erdrich not only lives there, but also owns a bookstore very similar to the shop in The Sentence. Birchbark Books describes itself as “a locus for Indigirati – literate Indigenous people who have survived over half a millennium on this continent”. And so it is with its fictional counterpart. Tookie looks over shelves filled with Indigenous history, fiction, memoir and poetry and “realised we are more brilliant than I knew”. One of their customers is Flora, a white woman who claims Native heritage. Tookie calls her “a very persistent wannabe”: a stalker of all things Indigenous. But when Flora dies suddenly, on 2 November, All Souls’ Day, “when the fabric between the worlds is thin as tissue and easily torn”, her ghost refuses to leave the bookshop. Her spirit haunts Tookie and her co-workers – and the mystery of her spirit presence is one of the motors that drives the book, as Tookie seeks to discover what keeps her drifting among the shelves. It’s not the only one. The joy of Erdrich’s novels lies in the way her characters live so richly, and are as present to the reader as our own friends and relatives are. Having had her life unexpectedly returned to her, Tookie savours the quotidian: the comforting presence of her husband, Pollux; her prickly relationship with her stepdaughter, Hetta. But as the novel’s chronology moves forward, catastrophe intrudes into Tookie’s happy if haunted life. An airborne virus closes the world down, though it makes the shop busier than ever, thank goodness. Erdrich captures the fear and the queasy pleasure of a suddenly deserted metropolis and a suddenly closed-down life. Tookie is content during the early months of the pandemic: safe. But Floyd’s death blasts apart any sense of safety, and in a sense takes the reader back to the novel’s beginning: to a legal system built on injustice and oppression, on the often brutal repression of Black and brown people. If the second half of the novel feels more chaotic than the first, why wouldn’t it? Erdrich is displaying the chaos of the moment as it occurs, and does so with astonishing grace. “I passed people going about their normal business, planting their gardens, flower beds, watering their lawns. I passed a popcorn store that was open and I stopped to buy popcorn. The popcorn smell modified the smell of old tear gas – sour, musky chalk.” The novel resolves in small moments of personal redemption and familial love, allowing for hope amid tragedy. Tookie’s courage and passion carry us; she is, throughout, a stalwart companion, facing hardship and aware of her own good fortune. “I live the way a person does who has ceased to dread each day’s ration of time,” she says – a motto to go by, surely, if we can.
