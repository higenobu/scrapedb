5/16/2022,"Rafael Leão held his head in his hands, but this was no gesture of despair. The Portuguese forward had just watched his Milan teammate, Theo Hernández, score the goal that would put them within a point of claiming the Scudetto, sealing a 2-0 win over Atalanta. He should have been celebrating but needed to stop for a moment and try to fathom what he had just seen. Theo had set off from the left corner of Milan’s penalty area moments before. When the ball ran to him from a sliding challenge by Rade Krunic on Jérémie Boga, he claimed it and took off, moving inside to shed one opponent and then accelerating away from another as he crossed halfway. Berat Djimsiti came haring across from the right, but Theo jagged left and caused the defender to collide with another teammate, Marten de Roon, on the edge of their 18-yard box. José Luis Palomino, the last defender, backed away, a bedazzled bystander to an unfolding moment in football history. Theo fired back across his body and into the bottom right corner of the net. It was not, could not be, the deciding goal in this season’s title race, not with Inter still in touching distance and waiting to play away at Cagliari later that evening. If Milan do seal the deal, though, this will be the highlight that gets played every time their triumph is remembered for decades to come. Parallels were immediately drawn with the iconic “coast to coast” goal scored by George Weah against Verona in 1996. They scored at opposite ends of the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, but he and Theo had started their runs from near identical positions, covering as many yards in more or less the same amount of time. Heck, even their names almost rhyme. Or perhaps comparing Theo to Weah was not taking things far enough. Milan’s goalkeeper, Mike Maignan, posted an Instagram story afterward insisting that “Not even Messi has done this”. Hyperbole? Oh, just a little. And who could begrudge that to a group who stand on the verge of ending Milan’s 11-year title drought? They are 15 games unbeaten in the league, and this was their fifth consecutive win. They were supposed to have the tougher run-in than Inter, with games at Lazio and ‘Fatal’ Verona, and home matches against Fiorentina then this Atalanta side – both chasing European qualification of their own. This Theo Hernández fella is unreal! 😱Runs through the entire Atalanta squad and slots home Milan's second.Is that the goal that seals the title? 🏆 pic.twitter.com/z6MsbhrSsO This weekend’s opponents might have taken a step back from recent seasons, falling out of the Champions League places after three straight third-place finishes, but they remain dangerous opponents for anyone: the fourth-most prolific team in the league. Milan had not beaten them at home for eight years. Stefano Pioli’s first game against them after taking charge of the Rossoneri in 2019 ended in a 5-0 defeat. On Sunday, Milan struggled at first to find ways through Atalanta’s deliberately congested midfield. Instead, in the second half, they bypassed it, Junior Messías lifting a pass over the top for Leão, who headed it down and ran through to slip a side-foot finish through the legs of Juan Musso for the game’s opening goal. Play should have been stopped before he ever had a chance to shoot. Milan had won possession with a foul, Pierre Kalulu bringing down Matteo Pessina from behind. Several players seemed to hesitate, expecting a whistle, but none came and Fikayo Tomori did well to stay alert in that moment, spreading the ball out to Messías to begin the move. Atalanta found their best chance in-between Milan’s two goals, Duván Zapata heading off target after getting in front of his man at a corner. He has not been the same since sustaining the first of a series of muscle injuries in December, scoring just once in his last 12 appearances compared with 12 in 19 beforehand. He is only the latest in a long line of strikers, however, to be thwarted by a Milan defence that has kept 17 clean sheets in this Serie A season, and 11 since the start of the calendar year. Pioli’s team are first and foremost very hard to break down. Among the many striking statistics of this Serie A season is the fact that the top scorer for the league leaders – Leão – has just 11 goals. Nobody else is in double figures. Milan have found different heroes in different moments, from Theo to Sandro Tonali, Olivier Giroud, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Swede did not get on to the pitch on Sunday, but he did crack the front window of the team bus as it arrived before kick-off, thumping too hard in acknowledgement of the sea of fans who waited to greet it at San Siro. Asked whether this could have been Ibrahimovic’s last chance to play here, Pioli said “I hope not”, leaving the door open for another contract renewal beyond this summer. He could not afford to indulge the Swede, or any other player, on Sunday with a title on the line. Even at full time, Pioli knew the job was not yet done, telling reporters he had shown his players a video of Kobe Bryant in which the five-time NBA champion insisted a playoff series was not finished despite his team leading by two games to none. Inter would not give them an easy passage. Later that evening, Serie A’s reigning champions won 3-1 at Cagliari, pushing the title race to the final weekend. Their manager, Simone Inzaghi, pointed out that he won a Scudetto under similar circumstances as a player in 2000, when Juventus suffered a 1-0 defeat at Perugia that allowed Lazio to jump ahead by a single point. “Sassuolo are an excellent team,” he observed of Milan’s final opponents. “We want to play out all of our chances, in football you can never give up.” Cagliari 1-3 Inter, Milan 2-0 Atalanta, Napoli 3-0 Genoa, Bologna 1-3 Sassuolo, Roma 1-1 Venezia, Udinese 2-3 Spezia, Verona 0-1 Torino, Empoli 1-1 Salernitana Monday Sampdoria v Fiorentina, Juventus v Lazio His misfortune is to run into rivals with the same mindset. “As I set off, I told myself, ‘I’m taking this all the way to the end’,” said Theo Hernandez as he sought to explain his solo strike. “It’s the most important goal of my life.” One so brilliant that some of his own teammates were unable to celebrate, losing themselves in the moment instead. Leão had his head in his hands on Sunday.

5/16/2022,"The Buffalo shooting has focused attention on the role of Twitch, the gaming platform used by the gunman to broadcast a live stream of the massacre, amid renewed calls for tighter regulation of social media platforms. Twitch allows creators, many with millions of followers, to stream themselves playing video games, chatting with fans, or simply going about their daily lives. The Buffalo suspect, a self-confessed white supremacist who allegedly shot 11 Black and two white victims, killing 10 people, in what authorities said was a racially motivated hate crime, used a Twitch channel to livestream the assault from a helmet camera. Amazon-owned Twitch said it took down the video within two minutes of the violence starting, but by that time it was already being shared elsewhere including on Facebook and Twitter. In a statement issued to the New York Times, Angela Hession, Twitch’s vice-president of trust and safety, said the site’s reaction was a “very strong response time considering the challenges of live content moderation, and shows good progress”. The fragmentary nature of modern social media platforms has added to the moderation difficulties. As news of the shooting went viral on TikTok, the platform’s moderators battled to take down uploads of the footage – but were much less successful at taking down videos that directed viewers to Twitter accounts where they could watch the shooting in full. The role of livestreaming is only part of the question. The shooter broadcast his intentions in advance – including by preparing a to-do list on the chat platform Discord – which meant some of his followers were ready to download the video as it was being broadcast. Initial repeat uploads appeared to come from supporters; however, within hours, the bulk of shares came from users seeking to satisfy the curiosity of others online – a similar pattern to that seen following the Christchurch shooting in 2019, which was initially livestreamed on Facebook before being distributed across YouTube, Twitter and Facebook itself. That live stream, however, ran for 17 minutes before Facebook’s moderators brought it down – a response time almost 10 times slower than that of Twitch. The New York governor, Kathy Hochul, told the ABC TV network on Sunday that social media companies needed to be held accountable for violent racist views circulating online. The Buffalo attacker posted a 180-page manifesto online before the shootings that focused on the racist “replacement theory”, a conspiracy theory that white people are being systematically replaced by non-white people. Hochul said tech firms “need to be held accountable and assure all of us that they’re taking every step humanly possible to be able to monitor this information”. She added: “How these depraved ideas are fermenting on social media – it’s spreading like a virus now.” The online safety bill and the Digital Services Act, pieces of legislation being introduced in the UK and EU respectively, are targeting criminal activity online but in the US progress is slower. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 absolves platforms of responsibility for content posted by others, although President Joe Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump, have supported overhauling it, albeit for different reasons. But the first amendment to the US constitution makes it unlikely that platforms will ever face significant liability for hosting racist content.",News/US news,Online hate under scrutiny after Buffalo shooter streamed massacre on Twitch,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/buffalo-shooter-twitch-streamed-online-hate
5/16/2022,"When Angelina Namiba was diagnosed with HIV in 1993, the virus was commonly believed to be a death sentence. “People were being told they had six months to live,” says Namiba, who is 55 and lives in east London. Thinking that if she was going to die, she may as well take a job to keep her busy, Namiba began working for a health authority. In her spare time, she volunteered for an HIV charity. Twenty-nine years later, Namiba is very much still here, and continuing her work. In 2016, the mother of one helped found the 4M Mentor Mothers Network, which trains women living with HIV to mentor mothers with the diagnosis across the country. In her work, Namiba draws on her experience of having her daughter in 1998. “I was lucky,” she says. “By the time I had my child, we had effective antiretroviral treatment, which meant I didn’t pass the virus on to my daughter, or partner.” But no pregnancy is without anxiety – and an HIV-positive pregnancy doubly so. “Pregnant women are worried not only about their own HIV, but also how the treatment will work for the baby,” says Namiba. Through the network, new mothers can “speak to other women who have walked in their shoes and can support them on the journey”. (Today, 99% of HIV-infected pregnant women who follow a treatment plan will not pass it on to their babies.) “Angelina is an incredible woman who makes real lemonade out of lemons for all around her,” says Alice Welbourn, who is part of the network. “She is a true leader and immensely loved and respected by all of us. I would just love the wider world to know what an amazing woman she is.” Namiba’s programme is led by Black women from migrant and refugee backgrounds. In addition to supporting women through their pregnancies, the mentors help them to come to terms with their diagnosis. “Sometimes women may be diagnosed for the first time in pregnancy,” Namiba says. “Sharing that with their significant others can be an issue. Women who are in abusive relationships may have to contend with their partners telling them that no one else will want them, and using that as a form of control. Others may have mental health problems that are exacerbated by the diagnosis.” Namiba and her fellow mentors help them to understand how to ask for mental health support, start their treatment, deal with side-effects and communicate with healthcare professionals. 4M Mentor Mothers also runs workshops to undercut the stigma around people living with HIV. “We don’t accept the negativity with which people tend to portray us,” says Namiba. “Someone living with HIV is a regular person.” She explains that asking people how they contracted the virus can be a loaded question. “People want to put you in a box, and see whether you did someone ‘wrong’. For me, what is much more important is how I live with HIV.” She says she is open about her diagnosis because “it’s important to have visible people out there. I’m not saying that everyone has to be out there. I know people who’ve been thrown out of their homes because of their status. But people who are able to do it, should. So we can show the world that people living with HIV are regular people. This stigma is killing people. It prevents them testing and accessing treatment, and staying on their treatment plans.” A lot has changed since Namiba was diagnosed. HIV is no longer understood to be a death sentence. But there is still much to be done. Most women and heterosexual men living with HIV in the UK are diagnosed late, sometimes after their immune systems have become damaged. “Anyone can be affected,” Namiba points out. When I ask Namiba what she’d like as a treat, she tells me how reading novels got her through a recent bout of ill-health. She enjoys books by African writers, and stories set in Africa. “They’re such a great way of escaping,” she says. Her favourite author is Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. The Willoughby Book Club has provided her with a regular selection of handpicked books tailored to her reading habits. Her first book, An Ordinary Wonder by Buki Papillon, promptly clatters through her letter box, and, when we speak, Namiba is about to dig in. “I’m really delighted,” she says, “because now I have a lot of African writers at my fingertips and I don’t even have to look for them! The books will be suggested for me. I’m really looking forward to enjoying my treasure trove.” Want to nominate someone for Guardian angel?

5/16/2022,"Repeatedly throughout last night’s The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee Celebration (ITV), we were told emphatically that the whole event was designed with the Queen’s interests in mind. There would be no youth-appeasing Live Aid-style concert. In fact, there would be no concession to popular tastes whatsoever. Instead, it was going to be two straight hours of looking inside Queen Elizabeth’s brain. So, if nothing else, at least we now understand why she looks so bored all the time. Good lord, was it a slog. The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee Celebration was essentially made up of three elements: celebrities, history and horses. And horses. And more horses. In retrospect, this unending equine onslaught should have been expected because, in a duplicitous move, ITV had basically just filmed the annual Royal Windsor Horse Show and passed it off as a once-in-a-lifetime jubilee celebration. The repackaging was so shameless that, for the most part, it was unclear whether the Queen actually knew any of this was for her jubilee or not. As such, your enjoyment of the night largely depended on how much you like watching lines of horses make geometric shapes. “This is a very difficult routine,” commentator Phillip Schofield told us again and again, as we were treated to the sight of several horses walking around a vast dirt area in a rectangle. Or in a circle. Or going quite fast, or going relatively slowly. Or, in one showstopping moment, temporarily lying down before getting back up again. The event was attended by 4,000 spectators and I sensed that those people, who love horses enough to watch them plod around for two hours, had an absolutely thrilling time. But the spectacle did not translate well to television at all. There was no idea of the speed or expertise or danger of any of it. I don’t want to repeat myself but, to the casual television viewer – perhaps lured in by the promise of big name celebrities – it was just a bunch of horses going backwards and forwards a lot. Only one horse-based segment stood out. When the Azerbaijani contingent arrived, hurling fire around and doing handstands on horseback, there was a moment of actual excitement. But that’s the level of daredevilry it takes to entertain a television audience in 2022 and, short of literally firing horses out of cannons, it’s a hard one to sustain. The horstravaganza wasn’t just horses for the sake of it, though. No, it was all in aid of the throughline of the evening, which was an attempt to retell 500 years of history in what felt like real time. Helen Mirren, dressed as Queen Elizabeth I, gave a speech about the Spanish Armada. Two fibreglass boats were dragged across the arena, the Spanish one getting booed beyond all comprehension by the audience. We were told about Guy Fawkes, about Captain Scott, about Barrington and Billington. All the way up to the present, in fact, with the modern age being represented by the Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force Steel Orchestra playing Hot Hot Hot on steel drums. It’s this retelling of history that prompted all the celebrity guests. The big draw of the night, of course, was Tom Cruise, who has a film to promote. Given how far Cruise will push his body in the name of entertainment, there had been hope he would indulge in some light stuntwork here: maybe abseiling from a helicopter or making a horse jump a doubledecker bus. In the end, however, he simply read a few passages from an Autocue, as did Damian Lewis and Martin Clunes . And that was it. Weeks of trailing, for the royal equivalent of presenting a Brit award. I don’t think I’m alone in feeling shortchanged. On Saturday night, Twitter became a swamp of Eurovision, with seemingly every single tweet dedicated to the event. Last night, I clocked only three or four tweets about The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee Celebration, and one of those read: “Is anyone watching ITV or am I having a stroke?” You can’t really begrudge the Queen for the show, because the least anyone deserves for keeping the same job for 70 years is getting to look at some horses for a bit. But that doesn’t mean we all had to. If The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee Celebration taught us anything, it’s that being a monarch might be hard, but filling two and a half hours of primetime ITV is much harder.",Arts/Television & radio,"‘More stunts, Maverick!’ Even Tom Cruise couldn’t save the Queen’s hellish jubilee horsefest",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/16/more-stunts-maverick-even-tom-cruise-couldnt-save-the-queens-hellish-jubilee-horsefest
5/16/2022,"A self-portrait of Joseph Wright of Derby, the 18th-century painter famous as a master of light and shadow, has been acquired for the nation through a scheme that allows people to donate artworks in lieu of inheritance tax. Self-Portrait at the Age of About Forty is the only self-portrait by Wright in which he depicts himself as an artist. It will go on permanent display in the city where Wright was born and lived. The painting was accepted in lieu of inheritance tax, settling a sum of £779,619. Because the work was worth considerably more, Derby Museum and Art Gallery made good the difference of £2.72m with a £2.3m donation from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, plus additional amounts from the Art Fund, private donors and foundations. The arts minister Lord Parkinson said: “It is wonderful that this rare self-portrait by Joseph Wright has been saved for the nation and acquired by Derby Museums … where it will take pride of place in the world’s largest collection of his works.” Tony Butler, the museum’s executive director, said: “The acquisition of this painting is a triumph for Derby Museums. The work has never been in public ownership having remained in private hands since it was executed in a studio not far from where Derby Museum and Art Gallery is now. We feel a palpable sense of bringing Joseph Wright of Derby back home.” The painting, completed around 1772, shows Wright holding a porte-crayon, with a white chalk at one end and a black chalk at the other. Light from a candle or fire plays on the folds of his artist’s costume. On the reverse is a study for Wright’s famous work, An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump, widely credited as his masterpiece, which was acquired by the National Gallery in 1863. Lucy Bamford, curator at the museum and expert on Wright’s work, said the self-portrait was of significant artistic quality. “The way it depicts his growing confidence as an artist is wonderful, and the incredible verso is the icing on the cake as it tells us so much about his way of working.” The self-portrait, in its original elaborate frame, has been in a private collection since it was completed, and rarely seen in public. It will be displayed at the museum in a free-standing case, allowing both sides to be seen. Acceptance in Lieu (AiL) allows people to pay an inheritance tax bill by transferring important cultural, scientific or historic objects and archives to the nation.

5/16/2022,"“We were the last resort for a lot of music because nobody else would touch it,” says Tony Herrington, publisher of the Wire magazine. He also once said: “Most people would take the mickey out of some bloke making music by bowing away at the femur of a mountain goat, but we’ll give them the benefit of the doubt.” For 40 years – it is celebrating this anniversary with a series of events in July – the Wire has been covering bold, strange, noisy, genre-busting experimental music, in a crisp, sharply designed magazine. It champions outsider artists and movements with profound reverence. Recent cover stars, the Argentine psych outfit Reynols, being a prime example. “Frontman Miguel Tomasín has Down’s syndrome and he’s front and centre,” says Herrington. “You don’t find people with Down’s syndrome on the cover of music magazines. But they’re there because they are one of the most interesting groups to have emerged over the last 25 years.” He casts this open-minded approach in stark contrast to their rivals. “With magazines like Songlines and Jazzwise, I might be interested in the music they’re talking about but I hate the way they talk about it,” says Herrington. “I hate the way they present it. I hate every aspect of those magazines. I fucking hate Mojo because I should be one of their key readers but it is so dull and conservative, the way they write about music. They’ve managed to make everything into grey slush. There are no new angles on the Beatles, Bob Dylan or the Rolling Stones. “People read Wire to find out about what they don’t know about, rather than to have what they already know reinforced.” The Wire was founded in 1982 by Anthony Wood and Chrissie Murray, who were frustrated with poor jazz coverage in other titles, and concocted in an Italian restaurant that doubled as the pair’s office. The then quarterly publication was named after a Steve Lacy track and given the strapline “jazz, improvised music and …”. It went monthly in 1984. Over the next decade it searched for itself, flitting between “the Wire” and “Wire”, trying new straplines, exploring more commercially leaning editorial philosophies, and going through three editors (Richard Cook, Mark Sinker, then Herrington). “It was a weird period,” Herrington recalls. “The great schism was when Michael Jackson was on the cover in 1991. I was working in a record shop and everyone knew I wrote for the Wire. People were berating me, like, ‘What the fuck is that?’ One bloke asked: ‘Can I have a bag? I’m not walking around with that’.” Rob Young, who became deputy editor in 1993 before being appointed editor in 2000, remembers: “It lost them a lot of core readers, and there were strong ripples.” It caused arguments. “There was a lot of internal tension about what the Wire actually was, and should it return to its jazz roots. But the editorial energies were surging towards stuff like Warp Records and early glimmerings of post-rock.” With a staff full of impassioned music heads, debates could be heated. “There was always trepidation coming to an editorial meeting,” says Young. “Putting an idea on the table and having a savage pack of dogs rip it to shreds.” Contributing editor Anne Hilde Neset recalls similarly. “You’d really need to defend something that wasn’t agreed upon as Wire-approved,” she says. “It’s very different today – of course you can like Rihanna and Coil – but at the time it was much more tribal.” The office stereo was “trial by fire”, says Young. “Musical reputations could be trashed after five seconds of some terrible intro.” By the late 90s, the Wire had settled into a more consistent groove as a home for radical music spanning genres and continents – as captured by a new strapline that stayed until 2012: “Adventures in Modern Music.” For Herrington, it was key that experimental music be given a broader definition. “There’s a certain pomposity, which I despise, that the Wire has always kicked against,” he says. “The idea that there’s a kind of formal experimental music. We are interested in experimental culture manifesting all over.” It remained a slog, taking years to convince labels and readers alike that they weren’t just a jazz title. But a vital network began to grow around it in a pre- and early-internet world. “We were a community,” says Neset. “Somewhere you could talk about obscure music without being seen as strange. You felt like you belonged.” The Wire often has an acute focus on scenes, cities, genres and micro-genres – say, nu-jazz in South Africa – but it has remained suspicious of PR bluster and hyperbole. “It’s so easy to commission a feature on someone being touted around,” says Young. “It’s about positioning yourself in a different space and refusing to take what’s handed to you on a plate.” On their covers, alongside the odd bigger name such as Scott Walker, Laurie Anderson or John Cale, they’ve championed artists such as outsider rapper Lil B or Japanese avant-pop singer Eiko Ishibashi. The writing is often positioned to be as agenda-setting as the music itself, with pieces having given birth to genre labels such as post-rock, microhouse or New Weird America. “New developments in music require new developments in the language of music,” says Young. “We really encouraged that.” Neset adds: “We were interested in reading experiences. To let the text be an adventure in sound.” Writers have included Simon Reynolds, David Toop, Kodwo Eshun, Ian Penman, Nina Power and a pre-fame Jonathan Coe. Herrington says of its appeal to talented contributors: “There’s something about the title that communicates that it is serious about serious music. Not up its own arse but not taking the piss.” Detractors may see this serious approach to serious music as snobby and lofty. “People used to say, ‘Oh, the Wire is too intellectual’,” says Herrington. “It’s hilarious. I left school at 16. The best one is when people say: ‘The Wire’s shit, I haven’t read it for years’. Well, how do you know it’s shit?!” Young adds: “Some people don’t think music is something you should think too hard about,” he says. “That’s fine, but it’s not right to criticise those that want to get something more out of it. It was never about publishing writing that is difficult to understand but about trying to open music up and shine a light on it. Not to sell it out by cheapening it. You have to give it the respect and intelligent treatment it deserves. If that’s elitist then so be it.” Neset compares it to the Angling Times. “It’s specialist knowledge and it’s proud to be specialist knowledge. If you’re not interested in fishing, don’t buy it.” In 2001 six staff, including Herrington, Young and Neset, bought the magazine from its publisher, Naim Attallah. “He said, ‘I want you to sell the Wire for me’,” recalls Herrington. “I offered to buy it but he told me: ‘You can’t afford it because I know how much I pay you.’” The staff members got a loan, negotiated for six months and bought it between them. “We didn’t want anyone else to have it,” says Herrington. “It was our lives.” It came after a frustrating and exhausting period when profits were not being put back into the title, technology was primitive, staffing was minimal, hours were crushing and pay was poor. Every issue was jokingly referred to as “the farewell issue”. “People were close to the edge in terms of mental health,” says Young. “Something had to give … the magazine or us.” The buyout re-energised the title and it entered its most successful period, with circulation peaking at about 27,000 in the early 2000s. Due to its niche nature, it has become a deeply important publication to artists as well as readers. “Its existence creates a frame around a disparate community of artists,” says Stephen O’Malley of drone titans Sunn O))). “It means a lot to be included in those communities, especially considering our background roots of metal are often pushed aside as non-artistic or immature.” Avant-pop artist Jenny Hval says: “Because I’ve been an outsider in so many different settings, it’s even more important for me to have the support from the Wire.” However, just when things were going well, the 2008 financial crash hit hard, compounded by the rise of internet publishing. “We felt very much out on our own, kicking against what we perceived to be the rest of the music media,” says Herrington. “Now there’s massive amounts of it and it’s incredibly difficult to cut through. It’s biting on our style and I used to get really annoyed with it – why can’t they just fuck off, this is our territory? – but it’s completely pointless, you’re like King Canute trying to push back the sea. We have lots of colleagues rather than rivals.” In 2002, when the Wire turned 20, Young pondered whether “some invisible guardian watches over the Wire. How else could such a capricious, unbusinesslike, idealistic, confoundedly cussed operation have lasted for one-fifth of a century?” Twenty years on, does he find himself asking the same question? “It is pretty miraculous,” he says. “I think it’s become more capricious and cussed and that can only be a good thing. To have survived the digital publishing and streaming revolution while making a magazine like this is quite extraordinary.”  The Wire marks its 40th anniversary with live events in July in London, Bristol, Brighton, Manchester, Glasgow, Chicago, and online.",Arts/Music,"40 years of the Wire magazine: ‘Music deserves intelligent treatment.

5/16/2022,"As the virus accelerates it evolution, the humans capitulate. For two and a half years, the virus has been outrunning our response, getting progressively more and more transmissible, reaching a level of infectiousness that few pathogens have ever attained. Instead of taking a stance of getting ahead of the virus, and out-smarting it, people have succumbed. In recent months, we experienced a striking jump in transmissibility when the Omicron (BA.1) variant became dominant with at least a threefold increase in reproductive number beyond Delta. Despite the hope that this might be reaching the upper limit of the virus’s spread ability, we quickly transitioned to a BA.2 wave with another jump of about 30% transmissibility, and now we are heading, in the United States, to a dominant subvariant known as BA.2.1.2.1, which is 25% more transmissible than BA.2 and already accounting for close to 50% of new cases. This surely constitutes a meaningful acceleration of the virus’s evolution. There have been thousands of variants over the course of the pandemic, but only five major variants, affecting large populations of people, received Greek letter designations (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron). Each of these previous variants had numerous sub-lineages, or mutations that might be considered relatives of the main variant, but had no functional consequence – they did not increase transmissibility or pathogenicity. But with Omicron, we have already seen multiple subvariants with heightened infectiousness, not just BA.2, BA.2.12.1, but also BA.4 and BA.5 which are leading to a new wave in South Africa. As we watch the virus strikingly improve its ability to find new or repeat hosts, you would think it would be considered an urgent call for action. But instead, there has been a public perception that the pandemic is over, while, at the same time, public health agencies are adopting the policy that we have to “live with Covid”. No, we don’t have to live with Covid, because the Covid we are seeing now is deeply concerning. While there has not been a surge in hospitalizations, they are clearly on the increase, with more than a 20% rise in the United States over the past two weeks. The proportion of people getting hospitalized and dying among the vaccinated, as compared with unvaccinated, has substantially increased. As have the deaths: during the Delta wave in the United States, vaccinated individuals accounted for 23% of the deaths, whereas this nearly doubled to 42% during the Omicron wave. Many of these hospitalizations and deaths among vaccinated people can be attributed to lack of a booster shot or the substantially waned effectiveness that sets in by four months after a booster. Moreover, a major misconception is that the vaccines are holding steady to protect against severe disease, hospitalizations and deaths. They are not. When a booster was given during the Delta wave, that fully restored protection against these outcomes, to the level of 95% effectiveness. But for Omicron, with a booster (or second booster) the protection was approximately 80% – which, while still high, represents a significant, fourfold dropdown (lack of effectiveness of 55% v 20%). Accordingly, the confidence that our vaccines, created to fight the original strain from 2019, are highly protective against severe illness is exaggerated. No less concerning are the clear signs that the durability of such protection is reduced. All of this is tied to the marked evolution of the virus, and we yet lack any data on vaccine effectiveness against the BA.2.12.1 variant, soon to be dominant here. With the prospect for more noxious variants that lie ahead, it is unfathomable that we now surrender. No more funding from the government. The only new vaccine in the hopper is an Omicron booster, but since that is based on the BA.1 variant, it may not provide much protection against what we are seeing now (BA.2.1.2.1 has reduced cross-immunity) or where the virus will be come this summer when that vaccine may become available. We even face a shortage of vaccines in the months ahead. Rather than giving up, it is time to double down on innovations that have high likelihood of anticipating the further evolution of the virus and facilitating the end of the pandemic. First on the list is the development of nasal vaccines that are variant-proof. A nasal spray that induces mucosal immunity would help to block transmission, for which we have minimal defense now from the hyper-transmissible Omicron family of variants. Three such nasal vaccines are in late-stage clinical trials, but unlike the shots, there has not been any Operation Warp Speed or governmental support to expedite their execution or success. Next, with so many promising candidate drugs, is to speed these clinical trials. Recall that Paxlovid was the most rapid small molecule (pill) program in history, less than two years from design of the molecule to the completion of definitive randomized trials showing high efficacy and commercialization. Why hasn’t such aggressive pursuit been applied to so many other antivirals, which include pills, inhaled nanobodies and decoys? The concept of a pan-β-coronavirus or pan-sarbecovirus vaccine is alluring and has been pursued by academic labs throughout the world over the past two years. Tens of broad neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have been discovered, which have high likelihood of protecting against any future variant. But there is nearly a void of developing and testing a vaccine based on these bnAbs. Such vaccines are clearly in our reach, but the lack of investment in a high priority and velocity initiative is holding us back. A combination of nasal or oral vaccines, more and better drugs, and a variant-proof coronavirus vaccine would catalyze a definitive pandemic exit. The public perception that our vaccines are “leaky” is true, but it’s off-base to assign the fault to the vaccines, which have saved millions of lives around the world. It’s the virus’s accelerated evolution – its sneakiness and its ability to become more formidable over time – that is at the root of our problem now. We can outsmart and finally get ahead of the virus if we don’t submit to fatigue and to foolishness.

5/16/2022,"Greggs has revealed its sales in large cities and locations near offices are lagging behind those elsewhere in the country amid the shift to working from home. The bakery chain reported a 27.4% rise in sales at established outlets in the 19 weeks to 14 May, led by strong growth for chicken goujons and potato wedges, as sales surged back after the loosening of Covid-19 restrictions. Greggs said sales in transport hubs, such as railway and bus stations, had shown a “marked increase” as day trips, holidays and more office working returns. But the lag in recovery in large cities suggests commuters are making fewer trips to the office than before the pandemic. Greggs said its clientele were under pressure from the rising cost of living while it was having to adapt to rising prices from suppliers. “Consumer incomes will clearly be under pressure in the second half of the year. We will continue to work to mitigate the impact of cost pressures while protecting Greggs’ reputation for exceptional value,” the company said in a statement. Greggs said in March that prices were likely to increase because of a rise in the costs of ingredients, energy and fuel after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The company added 5p to 10p to the price of products at the start of 2022. The baker, which is best known for its sausage rolls and pasties, predicted profits would fail to increase in the year ahead as it tried to offset cost inflation of up to 7%, up from 5% at the start of 2022. The company faces a potential shareholder revolt over high pay for its executives at its annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday after criticism by two respected investor advisory groups. Bonus payouts for Greggs’ outgoing chief executive, Roger Whiteside, amounted to more than double his basic salary of £575,209, taking his total package to £1.9m including benefits. The investment adviser Pirc said shareholders should vote against the bakery chain’s remuneration report, arguing that Whiteside’s pay was excessive and amounted to 79 times that of a regular employee.",News/Business,Greggs sales lag in cities amid shift to working from home,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/16/greggs-sales-cities-working-from-home
5/16/2022,"Last month, the top official charged with addressing homelessness in Los Angeles announced her surprise departure, offering a scathing message on her way out: the crisis is “a monster of our own making”, she wrote in her resignation letter. “Those in power who possess the ability to change the lives of more than 60,000 unhoused Angelenos must be willing to do so.” Heidi Marston’s public comments about her decision to leave the Los Angeles homeless services authority (Lahsa) offer a rare look from an insider at the systemic problems that have prevented major metropolitan regions like LA from adopting the rapid, large-scale and humane response that the emergency demands. Marston’s exit comes as Los Angeles is home to an estimated 66,000 unhoused people and accounts for 20% of all Americans living outside. More than five unhoused Angelenos are dying every day. Local residents are falling into homelessness faster than the unhoused are moving indoors. Large tent communities are growing on city streets and in parks. The crisis in LA and in California has reached record proportions, but severe inequality is a growing problem in many US metropolitan regions. LA’s broken system, experts say, mirrors the failures of cities across America to help their most vulnerable residents. Lahsa is the lead authority responsible for coordinating housing and services for unhoused people across LA county, the most populous county in the US. Marston started at the agency in February 2019, having previously worked at the US Department of Veterans Affairs. Her tenure as director coincided with the pandemic, when homelessness in LA dramatically worsened, and residents voiced increasing frustration with encampments and the immense human suffering on the region’s streets. Amid the crisis, Lahsa has faced its share of pressure, and of criticism. Marston herself has faced internal opposition over Lahsa’s relationship with police and activists have been critical of the conditions of some temporary programs where the agency has placed unhoused people. But Marston has also pointed at deep and systemic issues impeding the region’s response. LA leaders, she argued in a recent interview with the Guardian, have focused too much on removing visible signs of homelessness rather than getting people the housing they need and addressing the root causes of the crisis. During the pandemic, LA city officials have shut down large encampments that grew at major public sites, including at the Venice Beach boardwalk and MacArthur Park, while also passing a local ordinance restricting camping. But they have made little progress in tackling rising costs of living, low wages and racism and inequality in housing policies, Marston said, pointing at the need to construct new affordable housing, increase tenant protections and reduce restrictive zoning laws that prevent building. Before Covid, an estimated 600,000 LA renters were living on the edge, spending about 90% of their income on rent. As of April 2022, more than 300,000 households were estimated to be behind on rent. Meanwhile, rentals on the LA market have become largely unaffordable to the majority of Black, Latino and low-income residents. LA’s encampment sweeps, which often escalate around major events like award shows and the Super Bowl, are another example of the region’s flawed response, Marston said: “Unhoused communities get pushed out further and are not offered real options. The tendency is to do quick fixes, which ultimately hurts the people who are already hurting.” Marston also pointed at governments’ continued disinvestment in homelessness services, primarily relying on underfunded non-profit groups at a time when need is significantly growing. “The model is … ‘We’ll give you a little bit of money, we need you to solve the issue.’” LA, for example, pays non-profit providers $55 a night per shelter bed, when it now costs organizations closer to $90 to provide that service, Marston said. “The gap between what non-profits have and what they need to truly operate is getting greater and greater, and unhoused people are paying the price,” she added. And she cited an internal conflict about the salaries of Lahsa workers, some of whom had been making wages considered “very low income” by federal standards. Ninety-one per cent of the lowest-compensated workers were people of color. “There is a fundamental gap between what we say we value and how we actually put that into practice,” she said, noting she had heard from employees who were themselves unhoused, living in crowded one-bedrooms or working multiple jobs to survive. “There’s a a lack of funding to do what is really necessary,” echoed Theo Henderson, an LA activist and podcast host who was previously unhoused. He has been critical of Marston and Lahsa’s services but said: “Politicians want to seem like they’re offering solutions … and they blame Lahsa because they believe Lahsa has a magic wand to solve houselessness. “Everybody is losing – the unhoused, the taxpayers, and the people that really want to address houselessness and come up with solutions,” he said. Marston’s resignation also underscored how homelessness policy in many American cities is controlled by elected officials whose main priorities aren’t solving the crisis for the unhoused. In LA, the Lahsa director faces directives from 15 LA city councilmembers, the mayor, the elected county supervisors and an oversight board of political appointees. “Our response in LA is driven by constituent complaints, by people who call their elected officials to complain about the encampment on the corner – not by the needs of the people who are unhoused,” Marston said. “It’s just moving the problem somewhere else.” She cited the anti-camping city law adopted last year that has allowed councilmembers to ban encampments from specific locations. The city claims it offers shelter to residents before evicting tent communities, but Marston, whose agency does the outreach, said the ordinance was counterproductive. “We don’t have enough resources to offer to people to go inside, and we’re reaching a point of saturation,” she said. Case managers now regularly lose contact with unhoused people because they’ve been dispersed, she said; a spot will open up for someone on a waiting list who has gone missing. In March 2021, for example, one city councilmember pushed for a law enforcement shutdown of an encampment at Echo Park Lake, which displaced hundreds of people. The city promised housing for residents, but one year later, as the Guardian reported, Lahsa’s data showed the vast majority of people evicted from the park were not in stable housing. It is important to balance different needs in public spaces, Marston said, but she argued that LA councilmembers were using the new ordinance “as a weapon to move people from anywhere you don’t want them”. Wealthier, whiter neighborhoods in the region tend to have more funding and land, yet they force the unhoused outside of their districts, she said: “We’re just building smaller and smaller fiefdoms and squeezing people out and creating greater inequities.” Of this year’s local elections, she added: “Candidates are running on fear, and running to appease housed constituents. The real change is going to come from people willing to do the right thing … even at the cost of losing their seat.” Che Ramirez, deputy mayor for city homelessness initiatives, said in a statement that the mayor’s office and councilmembers had “worked collaboratively to ensure all people experiencing homelessness in areas impacted by [the anti-camping ordinance] are offered housing and services”, and said the efforts at Venice Beach and MacArthur Park had been successful. Councilmember Bob Blumenfield, who supported the ordinance, said in a statement that “humane laws ... are helping keep major public rights of way clear” and that he was working to create more housing. Mitch O’Farrell, the councilman for Echo Park, has brushed aside the findings about the lack of housing for people displaced from the encampment. A spokesperson said last week that his office had “overseen the construction or approval of thousands of units of affordable housing, and we continue to have numerous successes where the work of our dedicated outreach teams results in housing or shelter”. Hilary Malson, a UCLA urban planning researcher, noted how unhoused people in LA have to learn which districts are safe for them to sleep outside in based on the political stances of different councilmembers. “In election season, the narrative is: ‘We can’t have people camping all over the sidewalks. Where is the enforcement?’ And my counterpoint is: where is the enforcement of tenant rights that prevent people from becoming unhoused? Where is the enforcement of human rights to prevent people from experiencing multiple displacements and violations?” LA will never solve the crisis while officials continue to focus on removing people from sight, she added. “There is no political will to do the hard work of addressing systemic issues that cause homelessness … There is more of a will to disappear the symptom of the problem of inequality.”",News/US news,‘We hurt those already hurting’: why Los Angeles is failing on homelessness,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/homelessness-los-angeles-lahsa-heidi-marston
5/16/2022,"More than the semolina, tapioca or rice pudding itself, it was the spoonful of jam I liked best. The adult in charge of the jar would land a blob of red in the middle of each bowl of white, and the jam would sink slightly and spread into a pink puddle. It wasn’t just at home that we had semolina with jam; we had it at school, too, and, like custard, there were no ambivalent kids: you either didn’t like it or you did. Years later, I would make myself semolina when I got home late, eat it while watching TV, then leave the pan to soak overnight. In The Book Of Difficult Fruit, Kate Lebo notes: “Recipes are rituals that promise transformation.” It is a line that stuck in my head like a tune. It feels especially true in relation to recipes that involve thickening. Lebo also describes how recipes “blend the precision of an instruction manual with the faith of a spell and, no matter when they were written, occur in the present”. It is just you, a pan, a whisk, milk, water and fine semolina. The recipe is as confident as a head girl: it will thicken. But will it? I always have to stop myself throwing in another handful, to force myself to have faith. And, sure enough, it transforms. Semolina comes from durum wheat, which, as its name suggests, is a hard variety of wheat, resistant to milling, reducing to an angular, granular texture, and the colour of pale egg yolks. Ground twice, it becomes a flour, semola rimacinata in Italian, which is gently gritty, like fine sand, and ideal for pasta (it is the stipulated flour for all factory-made dried pasta in Italy). Ground coarsely, hard durum wheat becomes semolina, suitable for couscous, porridge, puddings and today’s recipe. Migliaccio napoletano is a dense Neapolitan cake-pudding traditionally made for carnival, and on Shrove Tuesday in particular. The name tells us it was originally made from miglio, or millet, but these days most versions are made with semolina, hence the alternative name, torta di semolino. While migliaccio napoletano is unmistakably made with semolina and has a dense pudding quality, the eggs and ricotta lighten it to ensure a custard-like quality, too, which cuts into smooth slices that wobble slightly. We didn’t have any cream, but I think it would have been even nicer with a spoonful or two. Or cherries in syrup, from a jar or tin, or fresh ones stewed in red wine. Vincenzo cut his slice in two across the middle, so he could fill it with red (raspberry) jam.

In a saucepan, gently heat the milk with 400ml water, a pinch of salt and the lemon zest until it comes to a steady boil. Shake in the semolina, whisking as you do, and continue to do so until the semolina thickens to a very dense mixture. Add the butter, whisk again, then pull off the heat and leave to cool. In another bowl, beat the eggs and sugar until light and fluffy. Working slowly, with a hand or electric whisk on slow, beat in the ricotta-milk mixture, liquor (if using), grated citrus zest and, finally, the cooked and cooled semolina. It will seem a little lumpy, but don’t worry. Tip the mixture into a lined 24cm tin and bake for an hour, covering loosely with foil if it seems to be browning too quickly.

5/16/2022,"In the summer of 2018, Kimberley was coming to terms with the end of a relationship. To cheer herself up, she went on holiday to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. “I’d never taken a trip by myself before but it seemed like a good time,” she says. When she boarded her return flight to Vancouver, an attendant asked if any adults were flying solo. “There were children sitting in the emergency exit aisle who wouldn’t be able to operate the doors in an emergency, so they wanted people to swap seats. I sheepishly raised my hand.” She soon noticed that another passenger had done the same. “He was so tall and handsome,” she remembers. They sat down together and started chatting. “I was heading to Iceland on holiday, passing through Vancouver,” says Manuel, who is Mexican and worked as a hotel architect. “We started talking about Vancouver because it’s where Kim is from, then she told me her family is actually Icelandic.” As the trip progressed they discussed “a million different things” and discovered common ground. “We’d even studied at the same university,” says Kimberley. “The five-hour flight went by more quickly than I’d have liked.” “Just as we started our descent, Manuel swept the hair off my forehead and kissed me,” says Kimberley. “I thought life had just thrown this person towards me, so I kissed him back. It was surreal – I’ve never had anything like that happen before.” When Manuel arrived in Iceland, he sent Kimberley a Facebook message and they began to chat every day. “I told him he should be busy flirting with beautiful Icelandic girls, and he said he already was,” she laughs. In October that year, she returned to Mexico to see him. “I took her to my favourite beaches and we had some romantic dinners,” says Manuel. “I really fell in love.” They stayed in touch and, just after Christmas, he went to visit her in Vancouver. But the long distance soon took its toll. “I work in PR and, at the time, remote opportunities were not an option. We didn’t see how we could make it work,” says Kimberley. They took some time apart in 2019, but stayed in constant contact. “I did a lot of travelling that year to try to come to terms with the fact we couldn’t be together,” says Manuel. “I wanted to focus on my personal growth because I was feeling very lost.” When the pandemic hit in March 2020, everything changed. “It was a horrible time for the world, but for me it was also a kick – it was now or never for us,” says Kimberley. “I proposed the idea of me moving to Mexico to try and make things work.” Although Manuel admits he was a “bit scared”, he jumped at the chance. “She was being so brave, I couldn’t be the chicken.” In June, Kimberley packed her bags. “I was moving to a new country where I didn’t speak the language, in the middle of a crisis, but it was a big opportunity.” She was able to work remotely by then and job opportunities quickly opened up. They married in Las Vegas in November that year, one of the few places they were able to travel to, due to border restrictions. “Everyone came up to us to congratulate us and share their own love stories,” says Kimberley. She loves how inquisitive and passionate her husband is. “Manuel is so supportive and loving, with this great sense of adventure that helps me cultivate my own spontaneity. That’s really important to me. He also has a way of making me feel safe, even when other things are difficult.” Manuel appreciates his wife’s intelligence, her passion for nature, and her zest for life. “She’s such a fighter – she never gives up.

5/16/2022,"This Scottish period drama is “inspired” by true events and adapted from a novel by John MacKay, who says he based his book on something told to him as a boy: a story about a newborn baby found floating in the sea near his grandparents’ house on the Outer Hebrides. It struck me watching the film that it must really inspired by thousands of true events unrecorded by history: of women being raped and keeping silent out of fear – afraid of being blamed or not believed at all. Otherwise, it’s a heartfelt, nostalgic film with traditional, almost old-fashioned, storytelling, and acting that feels a bit stiff in places. Though there’s nothing inhibited about the wild beauty of the Hebridean landscape photographed by cinematographer Petra Korner. It’s set in 1916 in a crofting community on Lewis, where village beauty Kirsty (Hermione Corfield) wants more from life than planting potatoes. She’s devoted to her mother and sister but dreams of emigrating to the United States with her poetry-reading love interest, Murdo (Will Fletcher). But first he must go off to fight on the western front. It’s at a dance to wave off the village’s half-dozen or so men of fighting age – teenagers, really – that the rape happens. Afterwards, the local doctor (Mark Gatiss) treats Kirsty’s injuries with tact and delicacy – it seems like an act of kindness, but he makes the rape her secret. She tells no one. What follows is the familiar story of pregnancy and denial. Kirsty hides her baby bump, but a godfearing local gossip catches a whiff of something not quite right. The lesson here is that Kirsty’s tiny village is both small-minded and big-hearted. Like I say, it’s sentimental, though the way Kirsty is helped by women boiling with fury at the injustice does feel modern.

5/16/2022,"Workers in America’s fast-food and retail sectors who worked on the frontlines through the dangers of the Covid-19 pandemic are continuing a trend of strikes and protests over low wages, safety concerns and sexual harassment issues on the job. The Covid-19 pandemic has incited a resurgence of interest and support for the US labor movement and for low-wage workers who bore the brunt of Covid-19 risks. The unrest also comes as corporations have often reported record profits and showered executives with pay increases, stock buybacks and bonuses, while workers received minimal pay increases. Workers at billion-dollar corporations from Dollar General to McDonald’s still make on average less than $15 an hour while often being forced to work in unsafe, grueling conditions. On 2 May, Dollar General workers at a store in Marion, North Carolina, walked off the job over low wages. Ashley Sierra has worked at Dollar General for two years and makes just $11 an hour, while only receiving part-time hours. A mother of three, she relies on family members to barely make ends meet. “My weekly paycheck is no more than $200, $260 at the max. I have three children, I cannot survive on $260 a week, it’s just not working. It needs to get upped to at least $15 an hour, the bottom is $15, because we work so hard for so little,” said Sierra. Dollar General reported a profit of $3.2bn and their CEO was paid over $16.4m in 2021, 986 times the median pay of the company’s workers. Sierra said the store was often understaffed and overstocked with items that block aisles, and that she feared for her safety over potential robberies and theft when she and just one other co-worker are working the entire store. Dollar General did not comment on the company’s low wages. In regards to the walkout, a spokesperson said in an email: “We understand a small number of employees chose to express their personal opinions about the company earlier this week by walking off the job. We respect our employees’ right to engage in protected activities and as is our practice, we plan to listen, and are listening, to their feedback.” Workers at a McDonald’s in Los Angeles began a strike on Monday, 2 May, in response to plumbing issues at the restaurant that recently worsened, emitting odors that have made workers sick. “It gives me headaches, stomachaches and nausea, and it’s been happening to my co-workers also,” said Jasmina Alfaro, one of the striking workers at the McDonald’s location. “It has become a horrible smell all over the kitchen and store and we’ve noticed there’s water also leaking with disgusting debris.” She explained for the past year a foul odor had been emanating from pipes near the drive thru window, but severely worsened over the past week throughout the entire restaurant. Despite the odor, workers were still expected to conduct business as usual. Alfaro said she had missed days of work due to getting sick from the odor and had not been compensated for that time missed from work. Alfaro said the strike will continue until the problem is fixed, and the issue is an example of why fast-food workers in California need local proposed law AB 257 to pass, which would establish a statewide fast-food council with worker representation to set wage and other industry standards, including safety protections. “This is the only way we’re going to have a voice that represents us, so we can be listened to and not be ignored. We shouldn’t have to risk our health to make a living,” Alfaro said. A spokesperson for McDonald’s did not comment on the strike but claimed in an email: “This restaurant underwent a recent health inspection and was found to be in good standing. We have already begun repairing a plumbing issue that recently arose at the restaurant and expect it to be resolved shortly.” At a Jack in the Box location in Sacramento, California, workers went on strike for three days at the end of April 2022 over faulty equipment and safety concerns, and short staffing. Workers at a Wendy’s in Weaverville, North Carolina, went on strike on 23 April through 1 May over sexual harassment and abuse from the restaurant’s general manager toward employees that upper management had not addressed. Charity Bradley, a Wendy’s manager at the restaurant, claimed she was retaliated against for reporting complaints about the general management to corporate, as she was taken off the schedule and locked out of the crew app used to communicate with co-workers. Bradley was reinstated by the end of the strike and returned to work on 2 May. Bradley said the strike began the very next day after she was removed from the schedule and the app. “When we reported it to upper management, they pretty much just blew it off, they really didn’t do anything. We called the corporate hotline several times and never received any response,” said Bradley. She added: “Wendy’s could be a good place to work. They need to get it together and start taking care of their people and start doing what’s right, not sweeping it under the rug.” The CEO of Tar Heel Capital Corp, which operates several Wendy’s franchises in North Carolina, said in a statement in regards to the strike: “We are aware of the allegations being made and are taking this very seriously, following our policy of conducting a thorough investigation into the matter. As an organization, we strive to create a safe and comfortable work environment free from harassment. If, at the conclusion of our investigation, we find that any of the accusations are true, we will take swift disciplinary action.”",News/US news,‘I cannot survive on $260 a week’: US retail and fast-food workers strike,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/strikes-us-retail-fast-food-dollar-general-mcdonalds-wendys
5/16/2022,"Labor has pledged more transparent funding to arts and cultural institutions, an examination of a national insurance scheme to protect the live performance sector from further shutdowns, and a plan to force multinational streamers to produce more Australian content, as part of the party’s detailed arts and culture policy. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, also promised a Labor government would put First Nations art and culture at the forefront of its policies, and, in a symbolic gesture, restore the word “arts” as part of a named government department, if he wins the 21 May election. As he launched the policy under St Kilda’s Bunurong Corroboree tree (Ngargee tree) in Melbourne on Monday night, Albanese conceded the policy was light on spending announcements “designed to get me through the week”. Instead, Labor outlined what its cultural priorities would be to get the sector “back on track quickly” after the devastation caused by Covid-19 lockdowns and event cancellations, and said the party would tailor funding decisions to that cultural policy. “If we win this Saturday, Australia will have cultural policy reviewed, revived and relaunched this year,” Albanese promised. According to data from the industry body Live Performance Australia, Covid lockdowns, venue closures and social distancing rules drained an estimated $1.4bn from the national live entertainment industry in 2020 alone. Up until the pandemic hit, Australian arts and culture had contributed about $15bn to the economy annually. The final report from a recent parliamentary inquiry into the creative industries made arts policy its first recommendation, encouraging the government to “develop a national cultural plan”. But the Coalition’s arts minister, Paul Fletcher, dismissed Labor’s policy announcement as “just a plan for a plan” and said it was conspicuous in its lack of any specific dollar commitment. “What on earth have they been doing during nine years in opposition?” Fletcher said in a statement. “By contrast, the Morrison government has invested $1bn in the arts and creative sector in the current financial year – the largest investment ever by any commonwealth government, Labor or Coalition.” A significant proportion of that $1bn is one-off Covid-19 emergency funding to keep arts and cultural institutions afloat after the financial devastation of the past two years. In his March 2022 budget, the treasurer Josh Frydenberg confirmed the next $20m tranche of the Restart Investment to Sustain and Expand (Rise) fund to salve the scars of Covid would be the arts sector’s last, bringing the total rescue package to just over $300m, once the arts sustainability fund is also taken into account. According to the budget’s forwards estimates, the nation’s peak arts funding body, the Australia Council, will over the next four years receive a boost of about $3m, which is a 1.5% increase – significantly less than the current inflation rate. Earlier this month the Greens released a series of Covid recovery arts policies, based on the prospect of holding the balance of power in a minority Labor government. One of those policies was to extend the Rise scheme, which, under the Coalition, will cease in 12 months. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, and the party’s arts spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, promised to bring to the negotiating table a national live performance insurance guarantee similar to the one Labor now says it is considering. Bandt said the Greens would push a Labor government to demand global streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney to invest 20% of money earned from Australian subscribers to be spent on Australian content. The last time a major political party launched anything approaching an arts and cultural policy during an election campaign was in 2010, by Labor’s Julia Gillard, who promised $10m for the Australia Council to invest in up to 150 new artistic works, presentations and fellowships. It took another two and a half years after winning that election for the Labor government to launch its national cultural policy, Creative Australia. Less than five months later the government went into caretaker mode, lost the federal election on 18 September 2013, and the new Coalition government promptly ditched Creative Australia. Within two years, the Australia Council’s budget was slashed by $105m, (the extricated funds were diverted to the office of the arts minister George Brandis, to be disbursed at his discretion), Screen Australia’s budget had been reduced three times in 18 months to help pay for a $47.2m lure to Hollywood to bring the production of Thor and Alien films to Australia, the Book Council of Australia had been scrapped, and a further $52.5m had been cut from the Communications and the Arts portfolio. By mid-2016, grants to individual artists and projects had shrunk by 70% over just three years. On Monday, Albanese said Gillard’s short-lived Creative Australia would be the starting block for Labor’s new overarching cultural policy. “Last time it took nearly six years to develop Creative Australia,” he told the gathered arts leaders and practitioners. “And within six minutes of the Liberals and Nationals winning it was gone. “The sector has been through its hardest time ever. We don’t have six years. So instead of starting with a blank page a Labor government will use Creative Australia as the starting document and immediately work with you to update it.”",News/Australia news,Labor pledges to get creative industries ‘back on track quickly’ as it announces arts policy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/labor-pledges-to-get-creative-industries-back-on-track-quickly-as-it-announces-arts-policy
5/16/2022,"Real Madrid are more optimistic than ever that Kylian Mbappé will join the club this summer after positive talks in recent days. Mbappé’s contract at Paris St-Germain expires next month and Madrid are confident he will turn down an extension and move to the Bernabéu. The Spanish champions’ most recent negotiations included productive discussions on image rights. The 23-year-old said on Sunday a decision would be announced “well before” he joins up with France for June’s Nations League matches. “I will give my decision very quickly; it’s almost over,” he said. “My choice is almost made.” Mbappé joined PSG from Monaco in 2017 in a deal worth up to €180m and has established himself as one of the world’s finest players. PSG rejected several offers from Madrid for him last summer, the last worth €200m on deadline day, and have tried to persuade him to continue with the club. PSG’s sporting director, Leonardo, admitted last August that Mbappé had wanted to leave but said Madrid’s initial offers did not meet their valuation and that they were not willing to do business in the final week of the window. Mbappé scored for PSG in both legs of their Champions League defeat by Madrid this season. Madrid have already secured one notable free transfer, doing a deal to bring in the defender Antonio Rüdiger when his Chelsea contract ends. PSG have Paul Pogba on their list of potential signings and have held talks over a possible move for the midfielder, who is leaving Manchester United. On Monday Pogba’s agent is due to have discussions with Juventus over a potential return for the 29-year-old, with the player’s salary a key point. Pogba is not minded to consider a switch to Manchester City at this stage.",Sport/Football,Real Madrid optimistic of signing Kylian Mbappé as PSG forward says ‘it’s almost over’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/real-madrid-optimistic-signing-kylian-mbappe-psg-forward-says-its-almost-over
5/16/2022,"A debut graphic novel documenting the stories of detainees inside Villawood immigration detention centre has been named book of the year at the New South Wales premier’s literary awards, lauded by judges as “a labour of generosity” and “an unflinching critique of policy”. Still Alive: Notes from Australia’s Immigration Detention System by Safdar Ahmed took out the annual literary award’s top prize, worth $10,000, on Monday night, having also won the $20,000 multicultural category earlier in the evening. Put out by tiny Melbourne publisher Twelve Panels Press, Still Alive is going through a reprint after accruing significant critical acclaim. Ahmed, an artist and writer, first visited Villawood in 2011. While recording video and audio is not allowed in the detention centre, he was able to take his pencils and sketchbooks in. Four years later he won a Walkley award for his web comic Villawood: Notes from an immigration detention centre. Speaking on Monday, before learning he had won book of the year, Ahmed said that it was “quite a surprise” to win the multicutural category. “It is unusual for a comic or graphic novel to be nominated for a prize like this so I wasn’t expecting to even be shortlisted to be honest. I am delighted,” he said. “I think people are still quite unaware just how cruel and punishing Australia’s policies are against asylum seekers and refugees. I hope this book educates people.” Ahmed said he would be giving his prize money to his mother: “She supported me for many years. Creative work is a big struggle as the arts are so underfunded, but on top of that, I have Crohn’s disease, a chronic illness which has made academic work quite difficult. Mum’s helped me for many years, so this is a way I can support her.” The senior judge for the NSW premier’s Literary awards, Jane McCredie, said that this year’s judges had “grappled with 750 written works presenting a rich array of genres and styles which explore everything from the major themes of our times to the most intimate details of what it is to be human”. The judges praised the shortlisted works for “provid[ing] considered and vociferous commentary about the challenges we must urgently address and reflect on as a multicultural nation”, before naming Still Alive the overall winner “for its vision, ambition and achievement”. “Ahmed’s work stands out as an example of brilliant storytelling created with and through community, a labour of generosity, and love. It is an unflinching critique of policy and discourse that demonstrates the power of art,” the judges said. Almost $300,000 was awarded to authors and writers across 12 categories. Author Tony Birch won the $40,000 Christina Stead prize for fiction for his story collection Dark as Last Night, while Kate Holden took out the $40,000 Douglas Stewart prize for nonfiction for The Winter Road: A Story of Legacy, Land and a Killing at Croppa Creek, a true crime book about the 2014 murder of a NSW environment officer. Debut author Chloe Wilson won the $5,000 UTS Glenda Adams award for new writing, with her story collection Hold Your Fire. And Anita Heiss won the biennial Indigenous writers’ category, worth $30,000, for her novel Bila Yarrudhanggalangdhuray, which was also nominated for this year’s Stella prize. Nitram, the 2021 film about the Port Arthur massacre killer Martin Bryant, won the $30,000 Betty Roland prize for scriptwriting, with judges praising Shaun Grant’s script as “a masterclass in screenwriting … a script of international quality.” Book of the year: Still Alive: Notes from Australia’s Immigration Detention System by Safdar Ahmed (Twelve Panels Press) Christina Stead prize for fiction: Dark as Last Night by Tony Birch (University of Queensland Press) UTS Glenda Adams award for new writing: Hold Your Fire by Chloe Wilson (Scribner) Douglas Stewart prize for nonfiction: The Winter Road: A Story of Legacy, Land and a Killing at Croppa Creek by Kate Holden (Black Inc.

5/16/2022,"Hungary has been accused of “holding the EU hostage” over its refusal to agree an oil embargo against Russia, as the bloc struggles to reach consensus on its latest sanctions aimed at eroding the Kremlin’s ability to wage war. Lithuania’s foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, said: “Unfortunately the whole union is being held hostage by one member state.” He was referring to Hungary, which continues to block the oil embargo, despite being offered an extension on phasing out Russian crude until the end of 2024. “Everybody expected this will be enough,” Landsbergis told reporters, reflecting the widespread view that Budapest would fall into line if it got more time to convert its energy system to accommodate non-Russian oil. The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said there were no guarantees the issue would be resolved at a meeting of EU foreign ministers on Monday. “We will do our best to unblock the situation,” he said. “I cannot ensure this is going to happen because positions are quite strong.” Johanna Sumuvuori, Finland’s junior foreign minister, who said she would update her counterparts on Helsinki’s bid to join Nato, said on the oil ban: “It’s very important to do our utmost, so that we can make a strong statement as an EU.” The EU has been unable to agree to its sixth package of sanctions against Russia – which includes asset freezes and travel bans on prominent Vladimir Putin supporters – 12 days after the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, outlined plans for a Russian oil embargo to come into force at the end of 2022. Since the proposals, EU officials have made a series of concessions. A plan to ban EU ships from transporting Russian oil was dropped, after opposition from Greece and Cyprus, which worried their industries would lose out to competitors. Meanwhile, landlocked countries that are heavily dependent on Russian oil were offered a delay in joining the EU embargo. Hungary and Slovakia were given until the end of 2024, while the Czech Republic has been offered a June 2024 deadline. While Slovakia and the Czech Republic appear ready to sign off the sanctions, Budapest continues to hold out on the oil embargo, which the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has likened to an atomic bomb hitting his country’s economy. Hungary says it needs five years and hundreds of billions of forints to convert its Százhalombatta refinery near Budapest, which can take only Russian oil. Hungarian officials also say Croatia must boost its capacity to ensure access to alternative supplies. Von der Leyen announced last week that she planned a video conference with Hungary and other countries in the region to work out how to rework Hungary’s oil supply. No details have been announced since Von der Leyen made that statement. EU foreign ministers, who are meeting in Brussels for talks with Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, were never expected to produce a breakthrough on the sanctions hold-up. The 27 ministers are also meeting their Canadian counterpart, Mélanie Joly, who called for Finland and Sweden’s speedy accession to Nato.

5/16/2022,"Russia has told Finland and Sweden that their decision to join the Nato military alliance is a serious mistake with far-reaching consequences and that they should not assume that Moscow will not respond. The Finnish government on Sunday confirmed its intention to join Nato while Sweden’s ruling party agreed to drop its longstanding opposition to the idea, paving the way for a joint membership application within days. The decisions by the two governments, both of which have remained neutral or non-aligned since the end of the second world war, herald a historic redrawing of Europe’s security map prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. “The situation is, of course, changing radically in light of what is happening,” Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said on Monday. “The fact that Finland and Sweden’s security will not be strengthened as a result of this is very clear to us.” Ryabkov added that the two Nordic nations “should have no illusions that we will simply put up with it”, warning that the move was “another grave mistake with far-reaching consequences” and the “general level of military tension will increase”. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, also said on Monday that Moscow would “follow very carefully what will be the consequences” of the Nordic nations’ move “for our security, which must be ensured in an absolutely unconditional manner”. Russia has repeatedly warned both countries against joining Nato, saying such a move would oblige it to “restore military balance” by strengthening its defences in the Baltic Sea region, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Finland shares an 810-mile (1,300km) land border with Russia and Sweden a maritime border. Both countries have for decades considered that joining the 30-member, US-led Nato alliance would represent an unnecessary provocation of Moscow. However, Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February has led to a profound change in Nordic thinking, with public support for Nato accession in Finland more than trebling to about 75% and rising to between 50% and 60% in Sweden. The Swedish and Finnish parliaments on Monday began debating the issue, with the session in Helsinki likely to last several days. While 85% of Finland’s 200 MPs back membership, 150 have requested to speak and a vote was not expected on Monday. “Our security environment has fundamentally changed,” the prime minister, Sanna Marin, told parliament as she opened the debate on Monday. “The only country that threatens European security, and is now openly waging a war of aggression, is Russia.” In Stockholm, where the parliamentary vote was also expected to be a formality, the prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, told MPs “a historic change in our country’s security policy” was underway and that Sweden “needs the formal security guarantees that come with Nato membership”. She added: “Unfortunately, we have no reason to believe the current trend [of Russia’s actions] will be reversed in the foreseeable future.” A formal Swedish government decision to join the alliance is expected later on Monday. The Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, is due in Stockholm on an official visit on Tuesday and Wednesday, suggesting a joint application by the two Nordic neighbours to join the alliance could be formally submitted within the next three days. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said the countries would be “welcomed with open arms” and their accession would be quick, although Turkish objections could delay the process, which requires unanimity among members. Sweden’s defence minister, Peter Hultqvist, said on Monday Stockholm was working to overcome Ankara’s reservations, which centre on Swedish support for the Kurdish PKK group, designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the EU and the US. “We will send a group of diplomats to hold discussions and have a dialogue with Turkey so we can see how this can be resolved and what this is really about,” Hultqvist said. Speaking before a meeting with EU foreign ministers in Brussels, the Canadian foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, called for Finland and Sweden’s speedy accession. “Our goal is to be amongst the first countries to be able to ratify the accession of Sweden and Finland, because we know that the interim period between the accession demand and the ratification must be shortened,” she said. Joly added that she had held discussions with Turkey, saying: “We need to meet this moment, this is historic and it is way more important than any bilateral issues.” Nato and the US have both said they were confident Turkey would not hold up the Sweden’s accession. “I’m confident we will be able to address the concerns Turkey has expressed in a way that doesn’t delay the membership,” Stoltenberg said on Sunday.",News/World news,Russia warns Finland and Sweden joining Nato would be ‘grave mistake’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/russia-finland-sweden-nato-ukraine-war
5/16/2022,"The UK government’s “jet zero” plan to eliminate carbon emissions from aviation relies on unproven or nonexistent technology and “sustainable” fuel, and is likely to result in ministers missing their legally binding emissions targets, according to a report. The study from Element Energy, which has worked for the government and the climate change committee in the past, says instead of focusing on such unreliable future developments, ministers should work to reduce the overall number of flights and halt airport expansion over the next few years. The report, released on Monday, was commissioned by the Aviation Environment Federation (AEF) and comes as five regional airports are in the process of seeking approval to expand. In addition, Gatwick and Luton have announced they will be submitting major applications later this year, while Heathrow has not abandoned its plans for a third runway. AEF’s policy director, Cait Hewitt, said the findings showed the government’s plan amounted to “sitting back and allowing both airports and emissions to grow in the short term while hoping for future technologies and fuels to save the day”. “These expansion plans will generate millions of tonnes of additional CO2 each year,” she added. “Until the government sets out a realistic net zero trajectory for the sector, and the industry is on track to outperform it, additional airport capacity should be off the agenda.” The government’s jet zero initiative was launched two years ago and is part of a raft of policies that aim to get UK emissions to net zero by 2050. Boris Johnson announced the proposals, declaring a goal of a commercial transatlantic flight that produces no carbon emissions by 2025, a claim that was widely dismissed by experts as a gimmick. The report adds weight to concerns about the viability of the government’s plans, stating that it is unclear how the Department for Transport would “deliver the technological improvements” it was relying on in terms of sustainable fuel and aircraft efficiencies. It concluded that ministers should instead aim to reduce the number of flights now – halting airport expansion plans, expanding carbon pricing and taxing frequent flyers and kerosene. Hewitt said: “[There is] a need for action now, including ruling out airport expansion and limiting demand, to ensure aviation makes a fair contribution to cutting emissions by 2035 and is on a pathway to net zero by 2050.” The DFT did not respond to a request for comment.",News/Environment,Johnson’s ‘jet zero’ plan unrealistic and may make UK miss CO2 targets – report,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/16/boris-johnson-jet-zero-plan-unrealistic-co2-targets-report
5/16/2022,"Good morning. As Buffalo, New York, mourns the victims of a mass shooting at a supermarket Saturday that left 10 dead and three wounded, details are emerging about the shooter’s movements and how the devastating racist attack unfolded. The 18-year-old shooter, who is a self-confessed white supremacist, shot 11 Black and two white victims in a “racially motivated hate crime” authorities said. It plunged the mostly Black Buffalo East Side neighborhood into grief and shock. But the plotting of the attack happened many miles away, had likely been in development for months and even apparently involved a reconnaissance of the targeted area. The shooter is believed to have traveled about 200 miles (320km) from his home of Conklin, New York, to Buffalo but signs of trouble had surrounded him for some time. One year ago, he was the subject of a law enforcement investigation, according to the Buffalo News. Where did the shooter get the gun? Officials have said that the shooter purchased his gun legally in New York. He did not purchase the high-capacity magazine in this state, they said. Meanwhile, California parishioners managed to subdue a gunman who killed one person and wounded five senior citizens. A pastor was able to hit the gunman on the head with a chair and then other parishioners tied him up with electrical cords. The supreme court is “dangerous to families and to freedoms in our country”, Nancy Pelosi said yesterday, as justices prepare to finalize a draft ruling stripping almost half a century of abortion rights in the US. The House speaker railed against conservative judges appointed by the former president Donald Trump in an interview Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union, in which she urged Democrats to keep their “eye on the ball” to protect other freedoms she sees under threat. “Beware in terms of marriage equality, beware in terms of other aspects,” she said. “Understand this. This is not just about terminating a pregnancy. This is about contraception, family planning. “This is a place where freedom and the kitchen table, issues of America’s families, come together. What are the decisions that a family makes? What about contraception for young people? It’s beyond just a particular situation. It’s massive in terms of contraception, in vitro fertilization, a woman’s right to decide.” What did Bernie Sanders say on the subject? He said he remained hopeful that abortion rights legislation could be resurrected before the midterms. “Nobody should think this process is dead. We should bring those bills up again, and again and again.” Russia has attacked positions in eastern Ukraine as it tries to encircle Ukrainian forces in the Donbas and fend off a counteroffensive around the city of Izium. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Russia’s Donbas offensive had stalled and Ukraine could win the war, an outcome few military analysts predicted at the outset of the conflict. “Russia’s war in Ukraine is not going as Moscow had planned,” Stoltenberg said. Finland on Sunday confirmed it would apply to join Nato, while Sweden’s ruling Social Democrats backed Nato membership, paving the way for an application and abandoning decades of neutrality. Nato and the US said they were confident both countries would be accepted and that reservations from Turkey could be overcome – it wants them to halt support for Kurdish militant groups present in their territory. How is the Russian invasion going? British military intelligence said Russia had lost about a third of the ground combat force deployed in February, and its Donbas offensive had fallen “significantly behind schedule”. What is the US doing to help? Washington has delivered all but one of the 90 artillery pieces it was due to send, according to the US embassy in Kyiv. The US is set to press ahead this week with efforts to send more aid. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 82 of the invasion. Kash Patel, a former Republican aide on the House intelligence committee who Donald Trump weighed installing as deputy CIA director, is publishing a children’s book that perpetuates the false claim the Steele dossier sparked investigations into Russian collusion. Warnings that a new statue of Margaret Thatcher would attract egg-throwing protests proved prescient within two hours of it being installed. The bronze statue of the controversial former UK prime minister was, without ceremony, placed on a 10ft high plinth to make it more difficult for protesters to inflict any damage. A British man has claimed the record for the most ascents of Mount Everest by a foreigner after standing on the summit of the world’s tallest mountain for the 16th time.

Shanghai has set out plans for the return of more normal life from 1 June and the end of a painful Covid-19 lockdown that has lasted more than six weeks and contributed to a sharp slowdown in China’s economic activity. Shanghai’s reopening would be carried out in stages, with movement curbs largely to remain in place until 21 May. More than 1 million people have died in the Covid-19 pandemic in the US, according to Johns Hopkins, far and away the most deaths of any country. While the sheer number of deaths from the coronavirus sets the US apart, the country’s large population does not explain the staggering mortality rate, which is among the highest in the world. Among the 20 worst affected nations, only two other countries – Brazil and Poland – have higher mortality rates per 100,000 people. The perennial question about Cannes, that millionaire’s playground on the Côte d’Azur, is whether it is a creative response to the woes of the world or a means of laundering its worst excesses? Nobody is certain. The jury’s always out. Cannes thrives on frictions, contradictions; that’s part of its appeal. This year marks the festival’s 75th edition, a birthday of sorts. It provides the perfect excuse to rewind through the event’s past, celebrating its history as a home for provocation. “Love is a biological necessity. We cannot live without it,” Dr Stephanie Cacioppo says. “And that’s hard to say for someone who lost their best friend, their soul mate, and the love of their life. But I realised that love does not have to be with the person who is physically here with you … We can be in love with someone even if they live far away from you. Or even if they passed away; we lost so many people in our lives during Covid and I think many people can relate to that.” The expansion of an iron ore mine in the Arctic that would have increased shipping and led to the “complete extirpation of narwhal” from the region has been blocked. After four years of deliberations, the Nunavut Impact Review Board rejected a request from Baffinland Iron Mines Corp asking to significantly increase mining on the northern tip of Baffin Island in Nunavut, Canada. The area is home to one of the world’s richest iron ore deposits, and the densest narwhal population in the world.

5/16/2022,"A new coalmine proposed for Cumbria is likely to be redundant before it even opens because the steelmakers that are its target market are moving so rapidly away from fossil fuels, analysis from green campaigners claims. Steelmakers across Europe are moving to “green steel”, which uses renewable energy and modern techniques to avoid the need for coking coal of the type that the proposed mine in Whitehaven would produce. According to analysis from Friends of the Earth, about three-quarters of EU blast furnace steel-making capacity will reach the end of its life and require reinvestment by 2030. Most of this is likely to be replaced with low-carbon technologies that do not require coking coal. This would vastly restrict the available market for any Cumbrian coal. Tony Bosworth, coal campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “The UK steel industry will buy only a small percentage of the Cumbrian coal, and with European steelmakers already moving to greener steel production, the market for this mine is declining before it has even opened. The Whitehaven mine risks becoming a stranded asset, with no market for its coal, and potential consequences for the jobs the developers claim.” A decision on the Whitehaven mine is due to be made by 7 July, after years of dispute over planning. The proposals were delayed during the UK’s hosting of the Cop26 UN climate summit last year, when the government risked embarrassment on the world stage by opening a new coalmine while urging other countries to give up coal. Ministers and some Conservative MPs have argued that the Cumbrian mine could go ahead despite the UK’s climate commitments because it would produce coking coal, rather than coal for use in power stations, which is the main source of greenhouse gas emissions from coal around the world. Coking coal is used mainly by the steel industry, to create the high temperatures and chemical reactions needed to produce high-quality metal. They say the UK’s steel industry would otherwise need to import coal, with higher emissions than producing it at home. However, analysis by the independent Committee on Climate Change found that about 85% of any coal produced at the Woodhouse Colliery in Whitehaven was likely to be exported. Monday’s report from Friends of the Earth suggests that even this export market is unlikely to materialise, as steelmakers across Europe are moving rapidly to green production methods. Its analysis found that companies responsible for more than half of the large proportion of EU’s steelmaking capacity that needs reinvestment by 2030 had already announced plans that would avoid the need for new coking coal. These include announcements by ArcelorMittal that its Sestao site in Spain would be the world’s first full-scale zero emissions steel plant by 2025, and by Salzgitter, a German steel company, that it would move fully to hydrogen and renewable energy. SSAB in Sweden has also agreed to switch all of its steelmaking in Scandinavia to electric arc furnaces, which do not require coal. For coking coal to be needed, steelmakers would need to take a different route to cutting greenhouse emissions, by planning to use carbon capture and storage alongside traditional techniques, instead of switching to green steel with renewable power. Using carbon capture and storage could be more expensive than opting for renewable energy alternatives, however, and there is some evidence that companies originally considering this route may rethink: for instance, IJmuiden steel plant in the Netherlands will use hydrogen, instead of coking coal with carbon capture and storage. Bosworth said: “With the world facing a climate emergency, green steel is clearly the future – something that any sensible government should embrace. Michael Gove [levelling-up minister] must reject this mine and ensure that areas such as west Cumbria are at the heart of the green industrial revolution that the UK so clearly needs.” The UK’s steel industry has already rejected claims that it would require coal from Cumbria. Chris McDonald, the chief executive of the Materials Processing Institute, which serves as the UK’s national centre for steel research, recently told the Observer there was no demand from his industry for the west Cumbria mine. A government spokesperson said: “The UK steel sector is committed to decarbonisation, with individual businesses making commercial decisions on how to do so. We are working closely with the steel sector to support its transition to a low carbon future, including through our £315m industrial energy transformation fund.”",News/Environment,"Cumbria coalmine redundant before it even opens, say campaigners",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/16/cumbria-coalmine-redundant-before-it-even-opens-say-campaigners
