5/16/2022,"Rafael Le√£o held his head in his hands, but this was no gesture of despair. The Portuguese forward had just watched his Milan teammate, Theo Hern√°ndez, score the goal that would put them within a point of claiming the Scudetto, sealing a 2-0 win over Atalanta. He should have been celebrating but needed to stop for a moment and try to fathom what he had just seen. Theo had set off from the left corner of Milan‚Äôs penalty area moments before. When the ball ran to him from a sliding challenge by Rade Krunic on J√©r√©mie Boga, he claimed it and took off, moving inside to shed one opponent and then accelerating away from another as he crossed halfway. Berat Djimsiti came haring across from the right, but Theo jagged left and caused the defender to collide with another teammate, Marten de Roon, on the edge of their 18-yard box. Jos√© Luis Palomino, the last defender, backed away, a bedazzled bystander to an unfolding moment in football history. Theo fired back across his body and into the bottom right corner of the net. It was not, could not be, the deciding goal in this season‚Äôs title race, not with Inter still in touching distance and waiting to play away at Cagliari later that evening. If Milan do seal the deal, though, this will be the highlight that gets played every time their triumph is remembered for decades to come. Parallels were immediately drawn with the iconic ‚Äúcoast to coast‚Äù goal scored by George Weah against Verona in 1996. They scored at opposite ends of the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, but he and Theo had started their runs from near identical positions, covering as many yards in more or less the same amount of time. Heck, even their names almost rhyme. Or perhaps comparing Theo to Weah was not taking things far enough. Milan‚Äôs goalkeeper, Mike Maignan, posted an Instagram story afterward insisting that ‚ÄúNot even Messi has done this‚Äù. Hyperbole? Oh, just a little. And who could begrudge that to a group who stand on the verge of ending Milan‚Äôs 11-year title drought? They are 15 games unbeaten in the league, and this was their fifth consecutive win. They were supposed to have the tougher run-in than Inter, with games at Lazio and ‚ÄòFatal‚Äô Verona, and home matches against Fiorentina then this Atalanta side ‚Äì both chasing European qualification of their own. This Theo Hern√°ndez fella is unreal! üò±Runs through the entire Atalanta squad and slots home Milan's second.Is that the goal that seals the title? üèÜ pic.twitter.com/z6MsbhrSsO This weekend‚Äôs opponents might have taken a step back from recent seasons, falling out of the Champions League places after three straight third-place finishes, but they remain dangerous opponents for anyone: the fourth-most prolific team in the league. Milan had not beaten them at home for eight years. Stefano Pioli‚Äôs first game against them after taking charge of the Rossoneri in 2019 ended in a 5-0 defeat. On Sunday, Milan struggled at first to find ways through Atalanta‚Äôs deliberately congested midfield. Instead, in the second half, they bypassed it, Junior Mess√≠as lifting a pass over the top for Le√£o, who headed it down and ran through to slip a side-foot finish through the legs of Juan Musso for the game‚Äôs opening goal. Play should have been stopped before he ever had a chance to shoot. Milan had won possession with a foul, Pierre Kalulu bringing down Matteo Pessina from behind. Several players seemed to hesitate, expecting a whistle, but none came and Fikayo Tomori did well to stay alert in that moment, spreading the ball out to Mess√≠as to begin the move. Atalanta found their best chance in-between Milan‚Äôs two goals, Duv√°n Zapata heading off target after getting in front of his man at a corner. He has not been the same since sustaining the first of a series of muscle injuries in December, scoring just once in his last 12 appearances compared with 12 in 19 beforehand. He is only the latest in a long line of strikers, however, to be thwarted by a Milan defence that has kept 17 clean sheets in this Serie A season, and 11 since the start of the calendar year. Pioli‚Äôs team are first and foremost very hard to break down. Among the many striking statistics of this Serie A season is the fact that the top scorer for the league leaders ‚Äì Le√£o ‚Äì has just 11 goals. Nobody else is in double figures. Milan have found different heroes in different moments, from Theo to Sandro Tonali, Olivier Giroud, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Swede did not get on to the pitch on Sunday, but he did crack the front window of the team bus as it arrived before kick-off, thumping too hard in acknowledgement of the sea of fans who waited to greet it at San Siro. Asked whether this could have been Ibrahimovic‚Äôs last chance to play here, Pioli said ‚ÄúI hope not‚Äù, leaving the door open for another contract renewal beyond this summer. He could not afford to indulge the Swede, or any other player, on Sunday with a title on the line. Even at full time, Pioli knew the job was not yet done, telling reporters he had shown his players a video of Kobe Bryant in which the five-time NBA champion insisted a playoff series was not finished despite his team leading by two games to none. Inter would not give them an easy passage. Later that evening, Serie A‚Äôs reigning champions won 3-1 at Cagliari, pushing the title race to the final weekend. Their manager, Simone Inzaghi, pointed out that he won a Scudetto under similar circumstances as a player in 2000, when Juventus suffered a 1-0 defeat at Perugia that allowed Lazio to jump ahead by a single point. ‚ÄúSassuolo are an excellent team,‚Äù he observed of Milan‚Äôs final opponents. ‚ÄúWe want to play out all of our chances, in football you can never give up.‚Äù Cagliari 1-3 Inter, Milan 2-0 Atalanta, Napoli 3-0 Genoa, Bologna 1-3 Sassuolo, Roma 1-1 Venezia, Udinese 2-3 Spezia, Verona 0-1 Torino, Empoli 1-1 Salernitana Monday Sampdoria v Fiorentina, Juventus v Lazio His misfortune is to run into rivals with the same mindset. ‚ÄúAs I set off, I told myself, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm taking this all the way to the end‚Äô,‚Äù said Theo Hernandez as he sought to explain his solo strike. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the most important goal of my life.‚Äù One so brilliant that some of his own teammates were unable to celebrate, losing themselves in the moment instead.

5/16/2022,"The Buffalo shooting has focused attention on the role of Twitch, the gaming platform used by the gunman to broadcast a live stream of the massacre, amid renewed calls for tighter regulation of social media platforms. Twitch allows creators, many with millions of followers, to stream themselves playing video games, chatting with fans, or simply going about their daily lives. The Buffalo suspect, a self-confessed white supremacist who allegedly shot 11 Black and two white victims, killing 10 people, in what authorities said was a racially motivated hate crime, used a Twitch channel to livestream the assault from a helmet camera. Amazon-owned Twitch said it took down the video within two minutes of the violence starting, but by that time it was already being shared elsewhere including on Facebook and Twitter. In a statement issued to the New York Times, Angela Hession, Twitch‚Äôs vice-president of trust and safety, said the site‚Äôs reaction was a ‚Äúvery strong response time considering the challenges of live content moderation, and shows good progress‚Äù. The fragmentary nature of modern social media platforms has added to the moderation difficulties. As news of the shooting went viral on TikTok, the platform‚Äôs moderators battled to take down uploads of the footage ‚Äì but were much less successful at taking down videos that directed viewers to Twitter accounts where they could watch the shooting in full. The role of livestreaming is only part of the question. The shooter broadcast his intentions in advance ‚Äì including by preparing a to-do list on the chat platform Discord ‚Äì which meant some of his followers were ready to download the video as it was being broadcast. Initial repeat uploads appeared to come from supporters; however, within hours, the bulk of shares came from users seeking to satisfy the curiosity of others online ‚Äì a similar pattern to that seen following the Christchurch shooting in 2019, which was initially livestreamed on Facebook before being distributed across YouTube, Twitter and Facebook itself. That live stream, however, ran for 17 minutes before Facebook‚Äôs moderators brought it down ‚Äì a response time almost 10 times slower than that of Twitch. The New York governor, Kathy Hochul, told the ABC TV network on Sunday that social media companies needed to be held accountable for violent racist views circulating online. The Buffalo attacker posted a 180-page manifesto online before the shootings that focused on the racist ‚Äúreplacement theory‚Äù, a conspiracy theory that white people are being systematically replaced by non-white people. Hochul said tech firms ‚Äúneed to be held accountable and assure all of us that they‚Äôre taking every step humanly possible to be able to monitor this information‚Äù. She added: ‚ÄúHow these depraved ideas are fermenting on social media ‚Äì it‚Äôs spreading like a virus now.‚Äù The online safety bill and the Digital Services Act, pieces of legislation being introduced in the UK and EU respectively, are targeting criminal activity online but in the US progress is slower. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 absolves platforms of responsibility for content posted by others, although President Joe Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump, have supported overhauling it, albeit for different reasons. But the first amendment to the US constitution makes it unlikely that platforms will ever face significant liability for hosting racist content.",News/US news,Online hate under scrutiny after Buffalo shooter streamed massacre on Twitch,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/buffalo-shooter-twitch-streamed-online-hate
5/16/2022,"When Angelina Namiba was diagnosed with HIV in 1993, the virus was commonly believed to be a death sentence. ‚ÄúPeople were being told they had six months to live,‚Äù says Namiba, who is 55 and lives in east London. Thinking that if she was going to die, she may as well take a job to keep her busy, Namiba began working for a health authority. In her spare time, she volunteered for an HIV charity. Twenty-nine years later, Namiba is very much still here, and continuing her work. In 2016, the mother of one helped found the 4M Mentor Mothers Network, which trains women living with HIV to mentor mothers with the diagnosis across the country. In her work, Namiba draws on her experience of having her daughter in 1998. ‚ÄúI was lucky,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBy the time I had my child, we had effective antiretroviral treatment, which meant I didn‚Äôt pass the virus on to my daughter, or partner.‚Äù But no pregnancy is without anxiety ‚Äì and an HIV-positive pregnancy doubly so. ‚ÄúPregnant women are worried not only about their own HIV, but also how the treatment will work for the baby,‚Äù says Namiba. Through the network, new mothers can ‚Äúspeak to other women who have walked in their shoes and can support them on the journey‚Äù. (Today, 99% of HIV-infected pregnant women who follow a treatment plan will not pass it on to their babies.) ‚ÄúAngelina is an incredible woman who makes real lemonade out of lemons for all around her,‚Äù says Alice Welbourn, who is part of the network. ‚ÄúShe is a true leader and immensely loved and respected by all of us. I would just love the wider world to know what an amazing woman she is.‚Äù Namiba‚Äôs programme is led by Black women from migrant and refugee backgrounds. In addition to supporting women through their pregnancies, the mentors help them to come to terms with their diagnosis. ‚ÄúSometimes women may be diagnosed for the first time in pregnancy,‚Äù Namiba says. ‚ÄúSharing that with their significant others can be an issue. Women who are in abusive relationships may have to contend with their partners telling them that no one else will want them, and using that as a form of control. Others may have mental health problems that are exacerbated by the diagnosis.‚Äù Namiba and her fellow mentors help them to understand how to ask for mental health support, start their treatment, deal with side-effects and communicate with healthcare professionals. 4M Mentor Mothers also runs workshops to undercut the stigma around people living with HIV. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt accept the negativity with which people tend to portray us,‚Äù says Namiba. ‚ÄúSomeone living with HIV is a regular person.‚Äù She explains that asking people how they contracted the virus can be a loaded question. ‚ÄúPeople want to put you in a box, and see whether you did someone ‚Äòwrong‚Äô. For me, what is much more important is how I live with HIV.‚Äù She says she is open about her diagnosis because ‚Äúit‚Äôs important to have visible people out there. I‚Äôm not saying that everyone has to be out there. I know people who‚Äôve been thrown out of their homes because of their status. But people who are able to do it, should. So we can show the world that people living with HIV are regular people. This stigma is killing people. It prevents them testing and accessing treatment, and staying on their treatment plans.‚Äù A lot has changed since Namiba was diagnosed. HIV is no longer understood to be a death sentence. But there is still much to be done. Most women and heterosexual men living with HIV in the UK are diagnosed late, sometimes after their immune systems have become damaged. ‚ÄúAnyone can be affected,‚Äù Namiba points out. When I ask Namiba what she‚Äôd like as a treat, she tells me how reading novels got her through a recent bout of ill-health. She enjoys books by African writers, and stories set in Africa. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre such a great way of escaping,‚Äù she says. Her favourite author is Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. The Willoughby Book Club has provided her with a regular selection of handpicked books tailored to her reading habits. Her first book, An Ordinary Wonder by Buki Papillon, promptly clatters through her letter box, and, when we speak, Namiba is about to dig in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really delighted,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúbecause now I have a lot of African writers at my fingertips and I don‚Äôt even have to look for them! The books will be suggested for me. I‚Äôm really looking forward to enjoying my treasure trove.‚Äù Want to nominate someone for Guardian angel?

5/16/2022,"Repeatedly throughout last night‚Äôs The Queen‚Äôs Platinum Jubilee Celebration (ITV), we were told emphatically that the whole event was designed with the Queen‚Äôs interests in mind. There would be no youth-appeasing Live Aid-style concert. In fact, there would be no concession to popular tastes whatsoever. Instead, it was going to be two straight hours of looking inside Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs brain. So, if nothing else, at least we now understand why she looks so bored all the time. Good lord, was it a slog. The Queen‚Äôs Platinum Jubilee Celebration was essentially made up of three elements: celebrities, history and horses. And horses. And more horses. In retrospect, this unending equine onslaught should have been expected because, in a duplicitous move, ITV had basically just filmed the annual Royal Windsor Horse Show and passed it off as a once-in-a-lifetime jubilee celebration. The repackaging was so shameless that, for the most part, it was unclear whether the Queen actually knew any of this was for her jubilee or not. As such, your enjoyment of the night largely depended on how much you like watching lines of horses make geometric shapes. ‚ÄúThis is a very difficult routine,‚Äù commentator Phillip Schofield told us again and again, as we were treated to the sight of several horses walking around a vast dirt area in a rectangle. Or in a circle. Or going quite fast, or going relatively slowly. Or, in one showstopping moment, temporarily lying down before getting back up again. The event was attended by 4,000 spectators and I sensed that those people, who love horses enough to watch them plod around for two hours, had an absolutely thrilling time. But the spectacle did not translate well to television at all. There was no idea of the speed or expertise or danger of any of it. I don‚Äôt want to repeat myself but, to the casual television viewer ‚Äì perhaps lured in by the promise of big name celebrities ‚Äì it was just a bunch of horses going backwards and forwards a lot. Only one horse-based segment stood out. When the Azerbaijani contingent arrived, hurling fire around and doing handstands on horseback, there was a moment of actual excitement. But that‚Äôs the level of daredevilry it takes to entertain a television audience in 2022 and, short of literally firing horses out of cannons, it‚Äôs a hard one to sustain. The horstravaganza wasn‚Äôt just horses for the sake of it, though. No, it was all in aid of the throughline of the evening, which was an attempt to retell 500 years of history in what felt like real time. Helen Mirren, dressed as Queen Elizabeth I, gave a speech about the Spanish Armada. Two fibreglass boats were dragged across the arena, the Spanish one getting booed beyond all comprehension by the audience. We were told about Guy Fawkes, about Captain Scott, about Barrington and Billington. All the way up to the present, in fact, with the modern age being represented by the Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force Steel Orchestra playing Hot Hot Hot on steel drums. It‚Äôs this retelling of history that prompted all the celebrity guests. The big draw of the night, of course, was Tom Cruise, who has a film to promote. Given how far Cruise will push his body in the name of entertainment, there had been hope he would indulge in some light stuntwork here: maybe abseiling from a helicopter or making a horse jump a doubledecker bus. In the end, however, he simply read a few passages from an Autocue, as did Damian Lewis and Martin Clunes . And that was it. Weeks of trailing, for the royal equivalent of presenting a Brit award. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm alone in feeling shortchanged. On Saturday night, Twitter became a swamp of Eurovision, with seemingly every single tweet dedicated to the event. Last night, I clocked only three or four tweets about The Queen‚Äôs Platinum Jubilee Celebration, and one of those read: ‚ÄúIs anyone watching ITV or am I having a stroke?‚Äù You can‚Äôt really begrudge the Queen for the show, because the least anyone deserves for keeping the same job for 70 years is getting to look at some horses for a bit. But that doesn‚Äôt mean we all had to. If The Queen‚Äôs Platinum Jubilee Celebration taught us anything, it‚Äôs that being a monarch might be hard, but filling two and a half hours of primetime ITV is much harder.",Arts/Television & radio,"‚ÄòMore stunts, Maverick!‚Äô Even Tom Cruise couldn‚Äôt save the Queen‚Äôs hellish jubilee horsefest",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/16/more-stunts-maverick-even-tom-cruise-couldnt-save-the-queens-hellish-jubilee-horsefest
5/16/2022,"A self-portrait of Joseph Wright of Derby, the 18th-century painter famous as a master of light and shadow, has been acquired for the nation through a scheme that allows people to donate artworks in lieu of inheritance tax. Self-Portrait at the Age of About Forty is the only self-portrait by Wright in which he depicts himself as an artist. It will go on permanent display in the city where Wright was born and lived. The painting was accepted in lieu of inheritance tax, settling a sum of ¬£779,619. Because the work was worth considerably more, Derby Museum and Art Gallery made good the difference of ¬£2.72m with a ¬£2.3m donation from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, plus additional amounts from the Art Fund, private donors and foundations. The arts minister Lord Parkinson said: ‚ÄúIt is wonderful that this rare self-portrait by Joseph Wright has been saved for the nation and acquired by Derby Museums ‚Ä¶ where it will take pride of place in the world‚Äôs largest collection of his works.‚Äù Tony Butler, the museum‚Äôs executive director, said: ‚ÄúThe acquisition of this painting is a triumph for Derby Museums. The work has never been in public ownership having remained in private hands since it was executed in a studio not far from where Derby Museum and Art Gallery is now. We feel a palpable sense of bringing Joseph Wright of Derby back home.‚Äù The painting, completed around 1772, shows Wright holding a porte-crayon, with a white chalk at one end and a black chalk at the other. Light from a candle or fire plays on the folds of his artist‚Äôs costume.

Lucy Bamford, curator at the museum and expert on Wright‚Äôs work, said the self-portrait was of significant artistic quality. ‚ÄúThe way it depicts his growing confidence as an artist is wonderful, and the incredible verso is the icing on the cake as it tells us so much about his way of working.‚Äù The self-portrait, in its original elaborate frame, has been in a private collection since it was completed, and rarely seen in public.

5/16/2022,"‚ÄúWe were the last resort for a lot of music because nobody else would touch it,‚Äù says Tony Herrington, publisher of the Wire magazine. He also once said: ‚ÄúMost people would take the mickey out of some bloke making music by bowing away at the femur of a mountain goat, but we‚Äôll give them the benefit of the doubt.‚Äù For 40 years ‚Äì it is celebrating this anniversary with a series of events in July ‚Äì the Wire has been covering bold, strange, noisy, genre-busting experimental music, in a crisp, sharply designed magazine. It champions outsider artists and movements with profound reverence. Recent cover stars, the Argentine psych outfit Reynols, being a prime example. ‚ÄúFrontman Miguel Tomas√≠n has Down‚Äôs syndrome and he‚Äôs front and centre,‚Äù says Herrington. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt find people with Down‚Äôs syndrome on the cover of music magazines. But they‚Äôre there because they are one of the most interesting groups to have emerged over the last 25 years.‚Äù He casts this open-minded approach in stark contrast to their rivals. ‚ÄúWith magazines like Songlines and Jazzwise, I might be interested in the music they‚Äôre talking about but I hate the way they talk about it,‚Äù says Herrington. ‚ÄúI hate the way they present it. I hate every aspect of those magazines. I fucking hate Mojo because I should be one of their key readers but it is so dull and conservative, the way they write about music. They‚Äôve managed to make everything into grey slush. There are no new angles on the Beatles, Bob Dylan or the Rolling Stones. ‚ÄúPeople read Wire to find out about what they don‚Äôt know about, rather than to have what they already know reinforced.‚Äù The Wire was founded in 1982 by Anthony Wood and Chrissie Murray, who were frustrated with poor jazz coverage in other titles, and concocted in an Italian restaurant that doubled as the pair‚Äôs office. The then quarterly publication was named after a Steve Lacy track and given the strapline ‚Äújazz, improvised music and ‚Ä¶‚Äù. It went monthly in 1984. Over the next decade it searched for itself, flitting between ‚Äúthe Wire‚Äù and ‚ÄúWire‚Äù, trying new straplines, exploring more commercially leaning editorial philosophies, and going through three editors (Richard Cook, Mark Sinker, then Herrington). ‚ÄúIt was a weird period,‚Äù Herrington recalls. ‚ÄúThe great schism was when Michael Jackson was on the cover in 1991. I was working in a record shop and everyone knew I wrote for the Wire. People were berating me, like, ‚ÄòWhat the fuck is that?‚Äô One bloke asked: ‚ÄòCan I have a bag? I‚Äôm not walking around with that‚Äô.‚Äù Rob Young, who became deputy editor in 1993 before being appointed editor in 2000, remembers: ‚ÄúIt lost them a lot of core readers, and there were strong ripples.‚Äù It caused arguments. ‚ÄúThere was a lot of internal tension about what the Wire actually was, and should it return to its jazz roots. But the editorial energies were surging towards stuff like Warp Records and early glimmerings of post-rock.‚Äù With a staff full of impassioned music heads, debates could be heated. ‚ÄúThere was always trepidation coming to an editorial meeting,‚Äù says Young. ‚ÄúPutting an idea on the table and having a savage pack of dogs rip it to shreds.‚Äù Contributing editor Anne Hilde Neset recalls similarly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd really need to defend something that wasn‚Äôt agreed upon as Wire-approved,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very different today ‚Äì of course you can like Rihanna and Coil ‚Äì but at the time it was much more tribal.‚Äù The office stereo was ‚Äútrial by fire‚Äù, says Young. ‚ÄúMusical reputations could be trashed after five seconds of some terrible intro.‚Äù By the late 90s, the Wire had settled into a more consistent groove as a home for radical music spanning genres and continents ‚Äì as captured by a new strapline that stayed until 2012: ‚ÄúAdventures in Modern Music.‚Äù For Herrington, it was key that experimental music be given a broader definition. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a certain pomposity, which I despise, that the Wire has always kicked against,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe idea that there‚Äôs a kind of formal experimental music. We are interested in experimental culture manifesting all over.‚Äù It remained a slog, taking years to convince labels and readers alike that they weren‚Äôt just a jazz title. But a vital network began to grow around it in a pre- and early-internet world. ‚ÄúWe were a community,‚Äù says Neset. ‚ÄúSomewhere you could talk about obscure music without being seen as strange. You felt like you belonged.‚Äù The Wire often has an acute focus on scenes, cities, genres and micro-genres ‚Äì say, nu-jazz in South Africa ‚Äì but it has remained suspicious of PR bluster and hyperbole. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so easy to commission a feature on someone being touted around,‚Äù says Young. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about positioning yourself in a different space and refusing to take what‚Äôs handed to you on a plate.‚Äù On their covers, alongside the odd bigger name such as Scott Walker, Laurie Anderson or John Cale, they‚Äôve championed artists such as outsider rapper Lil B or Japanese avant-pop singer Eiko Ishibashi. The writing is often positioned to be as agenda-setting as the music itself, with pieces having given birth to genre labels such as post-rock, microhouse or New Weird America. ‚ÄúNew developments in music require new developments in the language of music,‚Äù says Young. ‚ÄúWe really encouraged that.‚Äù Neset adds: ‚ÄúWe were interested in reading experiences. To let the text be an adventure in sound.‚Äù Writers have included Simon Reynolds, David Toop, Kodwo Eshun, Ian Penman, Nina Power and a pre-fame Jonathan Coe. Herrington says of its appeal to talented contributors: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something about the title that communicates that it is serious about serious music. Not up its own arse but not taking the piss.‚Äù Detractors may see this serious approach to serious music as snobby and lofty. ‚ÄúPeople used to say, ‚ÄòOh, the Wire is too intellectual‚Äô,‚Äù says Herrington. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hilarious. I left school at 16. The best one is when people say: ‚ÄòThe Wire‚Äôs shit, I haven‚Äôt read it for years‚Äô. Well, how do you know it‚Äôs shit?!‚Äù Young adds: ‚ÄúSome people don‚Äôt think music is something you should think too hard about,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs not right to criticise those that want to get something more out of it. It was never about publishing writing that is difficult to understand but about trying to open music up and shine a light on it. Not to sell it out by cheapening it. You have to give it the respect and intelligent treatment it deserves. If that‚Äôs elitist then so be it.‚Äù Neset compares it to the Angling Times. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs specialist knowledge and it‚Äôs proud to be specialist knowledge. If you‚Äôre not interested in fishing, don‚Äôt buy it.‚Äù In 2001 six staff, including Herrington, Young and Neset, bought the magazine from its publisher, Naim Attallah. ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòI want you to sell the Wire for me‚Äô,‚Äù recalls Herrington. ‚ÄúI offered to buy it but he told me: ‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt afford it because I know how much I pay you.‚Äô‚Äù The staff members got a loan, negotiated for six months and bought it between them. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt want anyone else to have it,‚Äù says Herrington. ‚ÄúIt was our lives.‚Äù It came after a frustrating and exhausting period when profits were not being put back into the title, technology was primitive, staffing was minimal, hours were crushing and pay was poor. Every issue was jokingly referred to as ‚Äúthe farewell issue‚Äù. ‚ÄúPeople were close to the edge in terms of mental health,‚Äù says Young. ‚ÄúSomething had to give ‚Ä¶ the magazine or us.‚Äù The buyout re-energised the title and it entered its most successful period, with circulation peaking at about 27,000 in the early 2000s. Due to its niche nature, it has become a deeply important publication to artists as well as readers. ‚ÄúIts existence creates a frame around a disparate community of artists,‚Äù says Stephen O‚ÄôMalley of drone titans Sunn O))). ‚ÄúIt means a lot to be included in those communities, especially considering our background roots of metal are often pushed aside as non-artistic or immature.‚Äù Avant-pop artist Jenny Hval says: ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôve been an outsider in so many different settings, it‚Äôs even more important for me to have the support from the Wire.‚Äù However, just when things were going well, the 2008 financial crash hit hard, compounded by the rise of internet publishing. ‚ÄúWe felt very much out on our own, kicking against what we perceived to be the rest of the music media,‚Äù says Herrington. ‚ÄúNow there‚Äôs massive amounts of it and it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to cut through. It‚Äôs biting on our style and I used to get really annoyed with it ‚Äì why can‚Äôt they just fuck off, this is our territory? ‚Äì but it‚Äôs completely pointless, you‚Äôre like King Canute trying to push back the sea. We have lots of colleagues rather than rivals.‚Äù In 2002, when the Wire turned 20, Young pondered whether ‚Äúsome invisible guardian watches over the Wire. How else could such a capricious, unbusinesslike, idealistic, confoundedly cussed operation have lasted for one-fifth of a century?‚Äù Twenty years on, does he find himself asking the same question? ‚ÄúIt is pretty miraculous,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs become more capricious and cussed and that can only be a good thing. To have survived the digital publishing and streaming revolution while making a magazine like this is quite extraordinary.‚Äù  The Wire marks its 40th anniversary with live events in July in London, Bristol, Brighton, Manchester, Glasgow, Chicago, and online.",Arts/Music,"40 years of the Wire magazine: ‚ÄòMusic deserves intelligent treatment.

For two and a half years, the virus has been outrunning our response, getting progressively more and more transmissible, reaching a level of infectiousness that few pathogens have ever attained. Instead of taking a stance of getting ahead of the virus, and out-smarting it, people have succumbed. In recent months, we experienced a striking jump in transmissibility when the Omicron (BA.1) variant became dominant with at least a threefold increase in reproductive number beyond Delta. Despite the hope that this might be reaching the upper limit of the virus‚Äôs spread ability, we quickly transitioned to a BA.2 wave with another jump of about 30% transmissibility, and now we are heading, in the United States, to a dominant subvariant known as BA.2.1.2.1, which is 25% more transmissible than BA.2 and already accounting for close to 50% of new cases. This surely constitutes a meaningful acceleration of the virus‚Äôs evolution. There have been thousands of variants over the course of the pandemic, but only five major variants, affecting large populations of people, received Greek letter designations (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron). Each of these previous variants had numerous sub-lineages, or mutations that might be considered relatives of the main variant, but had no functional consequence ‚Äì they did not increase transmissibility or pathogenicity. But with Omicron, we have already seen multiple subvariants with heightened infectiousness, not just BA.2, BA.2.12.1, but also BA.4 and BA.5 which are leading to a new wave in South Africa. As we watch the virus strikingly improve its ability to find new or repeat hosts, you would think it would be considered an urgent call for action. But instead, there has been a public perception that the pandemic is over, while, at the same time, public health agencies are adopting the policy that we have to ‚Äúlive with Covid‚Äù. No, we don‚Äôt have to live with Covid, because the Covid we are seeing now is deeply concerning. While there has not been a surge in hospitalizations, they are clearly on the increase, with more than a 20% rise in the United States over the past two weeks. The proportion of people getting hospitalized and dying among the vaccinated, as compared with unvaccinated, has substantially increased. As have the deaths: during the Delta wave in the United States, vaccinated individuals accounted for 23% of the deaths, whereas this nearly doubled to 42% during the Omicron wave. Many of these hospitalizations and deaths among vaccinated people can be attributed to lack of a booster shot or the substantially waned effectiveness that sets in by four months after a booster. Moreover, a major misconception is that the vaccines are holding steady to protect against severe disease, hospitalizations and deaths. They are not. When a booster was given during the Delta wave, that fully restored protection against these outcomes, to the level of 95% effectiveness. But for Omicron, with a booster (or second booster) the protection was approximately 80% ‚Äì which, while still high, represents a significant, fourfold dropdown (lack of effectiveness of 55% v 20%). Accordingly, the confidence that our vaccines, created to fight the original strain from 2019, are highly protective against severe illness is exaggerated. No less concerning are the clear signs that the durability of such protection is reduced. All of this is tied to the marked evolution of the virus, and we yet lack any data on vaccine effectiveness against the BA.2.12.1 variant, soon to be dominant here. With the prospect for more noxious variants that lie ahead, it is unfathomable that we now surrender. No more funding from the government. The only new vaccine in the hopper is an Omicron booster, but since that is based on the BA.1 variant, it may not provide much protection against what we are seeing now (BA.2.1.2.1 has reduced cross-immunity) or where the virus will be come this summer when that vaccine may become available. We even face a shortage of vaccines in the months ahead. Rather than giving up, it is time to double down on innovations that have high likelihood of anticipating the further evolution of the virus and facilitating the end of the pandemic. First on the list is the development of nasal vaccines that are variant-proof. A nasal spray that induces mucosal immunity would help to block transmission, for which we have minimal defense now from the hyper-transmissible Omicron family of variants. Three such nasal vaccines are in late-stage clinical trials, but unlike the shots, there has not been any Operation Warp Speed or governmental support to expedite their execution or success. Next, with so many promising candidate drugs, is to speed these clinical trials. Recall that Paxlovid was the most rapid small molecule (pill) program in history, less than two years from design of the molecule to the completion of definitive randomized trials showing high efficacy and commercialization. Why hasn‚Äôt such aggressive pursuit been applied to so many other antivirals, which include pills, inhaled nanobodies and decoys? The concept of a pan-Œ≤-coronavirus or pan-sarbecovirus vaccine is alluring and has been pursued by academic labs throughout the world over the past two years. Tens of broad neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have been discovered, which have high likelihood of protecting against any future variant. But there is nearly a void of developing and testing a vaccine based on these bnAbs. Such vaccines are clearly in our reach, but the lack of investment in a high priority and velocity initiative is holding us back. A combination of nasal or oral vaccines, more and better drugs, and a variant-proof coronavirus vaccine would catalyze a definitive pandemic exit. The public perception that our vaccines are ‚Äúleaky‚Äù is true, but it‚Äôs off-base to assign the fault to the vaccines, which have saved millions of lives around the world. It‚Äôs the virus‚Äôs accelerated evolution ‚Äì its sneakiness and its ability to become more formidable over time ‚Äì that is at the root of our problem now. We can outsmart and finally get ahead of the virus if we don‚Äôt submit to fatigue and to foolishness.

5/16/2022,"Greggs has revealed its sales in large cities and locations near offices are lagging behind those elsewhere in the country amid the shift to working from home. The bakery chain reported a 27.4% rise in sales at established outlets in the 19 weeks to 14 May, led by strong growth for chicken goujons and potato wedges, as sales surged back after the loosening of Covid-19 restrictions. Greggs said sales in transport hubs, such as railway and bus stations, had shown a ‚Äúmarked increase‚Äù as day trips, holidays and more office working returns. But the lag in recovery in large cities suggests commuters are making fewer trips to the office than before the pandemic. Greggs said its clientele were under pressure from the rising cost of living while it was having to adapt to rising prices from suppliers. ‚ÄúConsumer incomes will clearly be under pressure in the second half of the year. We will continue to work to mitigate the impact of cost pressures while protecting Greggs‚Äô reputation for exceptional value,‚Äù the company said in a statement. Greggs said in March that prices were likely to increase because of a rise in the costs of ingredients, energy and fuel after Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. The company added 5p to 10p to the price of products at the start of 2022. The baker, which is best known for its sausage rolls and pasties, predicted profits would fail to increase in the year ahead as it tried to offset cost inflation of up to 7%, up from 5% at the start of 2022. The company faces a potential shareholder revolt over high pay for its executives at its annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday after criticism by two respected investor advisory groups. Bonus payouts for Greggs‚Äô outgoing chief executive, Roger Whiteside, amounted to more than double his basic salary of ¬£575,209, taking his total package to ¬£1.9m including benefits. The investment adviser Pirc said shareholders should vote against the bakery chain‚Äôs remuneration report, arguing that Whiteside‚Äôs pay was excessive and amounted to 79 times that of a regular employee.",News/Business,Greggs sales lag in cities amid shift to working from home,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/16/greggs-sales-cities-working-from-home
5/16/2022,"Last month, the top official charged with addressing homelessness in Los Angeles announced her surprise departure, offering a scathing message on her way out: the crisis is ‚Äúa monster of our own making‚Äù, she wrote in her resignation letter. ‚ÄúThose in power who possess the ability to change the lives of more than 60,000 unhoused Angelenos must be willing to do so.‚Äù Heidi Marston‚Äôs public comments about her decision to leave the Los Angeles homeless services authority (Lahsa) offer a rare look from an insider at the systemic problems that have prevented major metropolitan regions like LA from adopting the rapid, large-scale and humane response that the emergency demands. Marston‚Äôs exit comes as Los Angeles is home to an estimated 66,000 unhoused people and accounts for 20% of all Americans living outside. More than five unhoused Angelenos are dying every day. Local residents are falling into homelessness faster than the unhoused are moving indoors. Large tent communities are growing on city streets and in parks. The crisis in LA and in California has reached record proportions, but severe inequality is a growing problem in many US metropolitan regions. LA‚Äôs broken system, experts say, mirrors the failures of cities across America to help their most vulnerable residents. Lahsa is the lead authority responsible for coordinating housing and services for unhoused people across LA county, the most populous county in the US. Marston started at the agency in February 2019, having previously worked at the US Department of Veterans Affairs. Her tenure as director coincided with the pandemic, when homelessness in LA dramatically worsened, and residents voiced increasing frustration with encampments and the immense human suffering on the region‚Äôs streets. Amid the crisis, Lahsa has faced its share of pressure, and of criticism. Marston herself has faced internal opposition over Lahsa‚Äôs relationship with police and activists have been critical of the conditions of some temporary programs where the agency has placed unhoused people. But Marston has also pointed at deep and systemic issues impeding the region‚Äôs response. LA leaders, she argued in a recent interview with the Guardian, have focused too much on removing visible signs of homelessness rather than getting people the housing they need and addressing the root causes of the crisis. During the pandemic, LA city officials have shut down large encampments that grew at major public sites, including at the Venice Beach boardwalk and MacArthur Park, while also passing a local ordinance restricting camping. But they have made little progress in tackling rising costs of living, low wages and racism and inequality in housing policies, Marston said, pointing at the need to construct new affordable housing, increase tenant protections and reduce restrictive zoning laws that prevent building. Before Covid, an estimated 600,000 LA renters were living on the edge, spending about 90% of their income on rent. As of April 2022, more than 300,000 households were estimated to be behind on rent. Meanwhile, rentals on the LA market have become largely unaffordable to the majority of Black, Latino and low-income residents. LA‚Äôs encampment sweeps, which often escalate around major events like award shows and the Super Bowl, are another example of the region‚Äôs flawed response, Marston said: ‚ÄúUnhoused communities get pushed out further and are not offered real options. The tendency is to do quick fixes, which ultimately hurts the people who are already hurting.‚Äù Marston also pointed at governments‚Äô continued disinvestment in homelessness services, primarily relying on underfunded non-profit groups at a time when need is significantly growing. ‚ÄúThe model is ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòWe‚Äôll give you a little bit of money, we need you to solve the issue.‚Äô‚Äù LA, for example, pays non-profit providers $55 a night per shelter bed, when it now costs organizations closer to $90 to provide that service, Marston said. ‚ÄúThe gap between what non-profits have and what they need to truly operate is getting greater and greater, and unhoused people are paying the price,‚Äù she added. And she cited an internal conflict about the salaries of Lahsa workers, some of whom had been making wages considered ‚Äúvery low income‚Äù by federal standards. Ninety-one per cent of the lowest-compensated workers were people of color. ‚ÄúThere is a fundamental gap between what we say we value and how we actually put that into practice,‚Äù she said, noting she had heard from employees who were themselves unhoused, living in crowded one-bedrooms or working multiple jobs to survive. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a a lack of funding to do what is really necessary,‚Äù echoed Theo Henderson, an LA activist and podcast host who was previously unhoused. He has been critical of Marston and Lahsa‚Äôs services but said: ‚ÄúPoliticians want to seem like they‚Äôre offering solutions ‚Ä¶ and they blame Lahsa because they believe Lahsa has a magic wand to solve houselessness. ‚ÄúEverybody is losing ‚Äì the unhoused, the taxpayers, and the people that really want to address houselessness and come up with solutions,‚Äù he said. Marston‚Äôs resignation also underscored how homelessness policy in many American cities is controlled by elected officials whose main priorities aren‚Äôt solving the crisis for the unhoused. In LA, the Lahsa director faces directives from 15 LA city councilmembers, the mayor, the elected county supervisors and an oversight board of political appointees. ‚ÄúOur response in LA is driven by constituent complaints, by people who call their elected officials to complain about the encampment on the corner ‚Äì not by the needs of the people who are unhoused,‚Äù Marston said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just moving the problem somewhere else.‚Äù She cited the anti-camping city law adopted last year that has allowed councilmembers to ban encampments from specific locations. The city claims it offers shelter to residents before evicting tent communities, but Marston, whose agency does the outreach, said the ordinance was counterproductive. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have enough resources to offer to people to go inside, and we‚Äôre reaching a point of saturation,‚Äù she said. Case managers now regularly lose contact with unhoused people because they‚Äôve been dispersed, she said; a spot will open up for someone on a waiting list who has gone missing. In March 2021, for example, one city councilmember pushed for a law enforcement shutdown of an encampment at Echo Park Lake, which displaced hundreds of people. The city promised housing for residents, but one year later, as the Guardian reported, Lahsa‚Äôs data showed the vast majority of people evicted from the park were not in stable housing. It is important to balance different needs in public spaces, Marston said, but she argued that LA councilmembers were using the new ordinance ‚Äúas a weapon to move people from anywhere you don‚Äôt want them‚Äù. Wealthier, whiter neighborhoods in the region tend to have more funding and land, yet they force the unhoused outside of their districts, she said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just building smaller and smaller fiefdoms and squeezing people out and creating greater inequities.‚Äù Of this year‚Äôs local elections, she added: ‚ÄúCandidates are running on fear, and running to appease housed constituents. The real change is going to come from people willing to do the right thing ‚Ä¶ even at the cost of losing their seat.‚Äù Che Ramirez, deputy mayor for city homelessness initiatives, said in a statement that the mayor‚Äôs office and councilmembers had ‚Äúworked collaboratively to ensure all people experiencing homelessness in areas impacted by [the anti-camping ordinance] are offered housing and services‚Äù, and said the efforts at Venice Beach and MacArthur Park had been successful. Councilmember Bob Blumenfield, who supported the ordinance, said in a statement that ‚Äúhumane laws ... are helping keep major public rights of way clear‚Äù and that he was working to create more housing. Mitch O‚ÄôFarrell, the councilman for Echo Park, has brushed aside the findings about the lack of housing for people displaced from the encampment. A spokesperson said last week that his office had ‚Äúoverseen the construction or approval of thousands of units of affordable housing, and we continue to have numerous successes where the work of our dedicated outreach teams results in housing or shelter‚Äù. Hilary Malson, a UCLA urban planning researcher, noted how unhoused people in LA have to learn which districts are safe for them to sleep outside in based on the political stances of different councilmembers. ‚ÄúIn election season, the narrative is: ‚ÄòWe can‚Äôt have people camping all over the sidewalks. Where is the enforcement?‚Äô And my counterpoint is: where is the enforcement of tenant rights that prevent people from becoming unhoused? Where is the enforcement of human rights to prevent people from experiencing multiple displacements and violations?‚Äù LA will never solve the crisis while officials continue to focus on removing people from sight, she added. ‚ÄúThere is no political will to do the hard work of addressing systemic issues that cause homelessness ‚Ä¶ There is more of a will to disappear the symptom of the problem of inequality.‚Äù",News/US news,‚ÄòWe hurt those already hurting‚Äô: why Los Angeles is failing on homelessness,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/homelessness-los-angeles-lahsa-heidi-marston
5/16/2022,"More than the semolina, tapioca or rice pudding itself, it was the spoonful of jam I liked best. The adult in charge of the jar would land a blob of red in the middle of each bowl of white, and the jam would sink slightly and spread into a pink puddle. It wasn‚Äôt just at home that we had semolina with jam; we had it at school, too, and, like custard, there were no ambivalent kids: you either didn‚Äôt like it or you did. Years later, I would make myself semolina when I got home late, eat it while watching TV, then leave the pan to soak overnight. In The Book Of Difficult Fruit, Kate Lebo notes: ‚ÄúRecipes are rituals that promise transformation.‚Äù It is a line that stuck in my head like a tune. It feels especially true in relation to recipes that involve thickening. Lebo also describes how recipes ‚Äúblend the precision of an instruction manual with the faith of a spell and, no matter when they were written, occur in the present‚Äù. It is just you, a pan, a whisk, milk, water and fine semolina. The recipe is as confident as a head girl: it will thicken. But will it? I always have to stop myself throwing in another handful, to force myself to have faith. And, sure enough, it transforms. Semolina comes from durum wheat, which, as its name suggests, is a hard variety of wheat, resistant to milling, reducing to an angular, granular texture, and the colour of pale egg yolks. Ground twice, it becomes a flour, semola rimacinata in Italian, which is gently gritty, like fine sand, and ideal for pasta (it is the stipulated flour for all factory-made dried pasta in Italy). Ground coarsely, hard durum wheat becomes semolina, suitable for couscous, porridge, puddings and today‚Äôs recipe. Migliaccio napoletano is a dense Neapolitan cake-pudding traditionally made for carnival, and on Shrove Tuesday in particular. The name tells us it was originally made from miglio, or millet, but these days most versions are made with semolina, hence the alternative name, torta di semolino. While migliaccio napoletano is unmistakably made with semolina and has a dense pudding quality, the eggs and ricotta lighten it to ensure a custard-like quality, too, which cuts into smooth slices that wobble slightly. We didn‚Äôt have any cream, but I think it would have been even nicer with a spoonful or two. Or cherries in syrup, from a jar or tin, or fresh ones stewed in red wine. Vincenzo cut his slice in two across the middle, so he could fill it with red (raspberry) jam.

In a saucepan, gently heat the milk with 400ml water, a pinch of salt and the lemon zest until it comes to a steady boil. Shake in the semolina, whisking as you do, and continue to do so until the semolina thickens to a very dense mixture. Add the butter, whisk again, then pull off the heat and leave to cool. In another bowl, beat the eggs and sugar until light and fluffy. Working slowly, with a hand or electric whisk on slow, beat in the ricotta-milk mixture, liquor (if using), grated citrus zest and, finally, the cooked and cooled semolina. It will seem a little lumpy, but don‚Äôt worry. Tip the mixture into a lined 24cm tin and bake for an hour, covering loosely with foil if it seems to be browning too quickly.

To cheer herself up, she went on holiday to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never taken a trip by myself before but it seemed like a good time,‚Äù she says. When she boarded her return flight to Vancouver, an attendant asked if any adults were flying solo. ‚ÄúThere were children sitting in the emergency exit aisle who wouldn‚Äôt be able to operate the doors in an emergency, so they wanted people to swap seats. I sheepishly raised my hand.‚Äù She soon noticed that another passenger had done the same. ‚ÄúHe was so tall and handsome,‚Äù she remembers. They sat down together and started chatting. ‚ÄúI was heading to Iceland on holiday, passing through Vancouver,‚Äù says Manuel, who is Mexican and worked as a hotel architect. ‚ÄúWe started talking about Vancouver because it‚Äôs where Kim is from, then she told me her family is actually Icelandic.‚Äù As the trip progressed they discussed ‚Äúa million different things‚Äù and discovered common ground. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd even studied at the same university,‚Äù says Kimberley. ‚ÄúThe five-hour flight went by more quickly than I‚Äôd have liked.‚Äù ‚ÄúJust as we started our descent, Manuel swept the hair off my forehead and kissed me,‚Äù says Kimberley. ‚ÄúI thought life had just thrown this person towards me, so I kissed him back.

In October that year, she returned to Mexico to see him. ‚ÄúI took her to my favourite beaches and we had some romantic dinners,‚Äù says Manuel. ‚ÄúI really fell in love.‚Äù They stayed in touch and, just after Christmas, he went to visit her in Vancouver. But the long distance soon took its toll. ‚ÄúI work in PR and, at the time, remote opportunities were not an option. We didn‚Äôt see how we could make it work,‚Äù says Kimberley. They took some time apart in 2019, but stayed in constant contact. ‚ÄúI did a lot of travelling that year to try to come to terms with the fact we couldn‚Äôt be together,‚Äù says Manuel. ‚ÄúI wanted to focus on my personal growth because I was feeling very lost.‚Äù When the pandemic hit in March 2020, everything changed. ‚ÄúIt was a horrible time for the world, but for me it was also a kick ‚Äì it was now or never for us,‚Äù says Kimberley. ‚ÄúI proposed the idea of me moving to Mexico to try and make things work.‚Äù Although Manuel admits he was a ‚Äúbit scared‚Äù, he jumped at the chance. ‚ÄúShe was being so brave, I couldn‚Äôt be the chicken.‚Äù In June, Kimberley packed her bags. ‚ÄúI was moving to a new country where I didn‚Äôt speak the language, in the middle of a crisis, but it was a big opportunity.‚Äù She was able to work remotely by then and job opportunities quickly opened up.

5/16/2022,"This Scottish period drama is ‚Äúinspired‚Äù by true events and adapted from a novel by John MacKay, who says he based his book on something told to him as a boy: a story about a newborn baby found floating in the sea near his grandparents‚Äô house on the Outer Hebrides. It struck me watching the film that it must really inspired by thousands of true events unrecorded by history: of women being raped and keeping silent out of fear ‚Äì afraid of being blamed or not believed at all.

5/16/2022,"Workers in America‚Äôs fast-food and retail sectors who worked on the frontlines through the dangers of the Covid-19 pandemic are continuing a trend of strikes and protests over low wages, safety concerns and sexual harassment issues on the job. The Covid-19 pandemic has incited a resurgence of interest and support for the US labor movement and for low-wage workers who bore the brunt of Covid-19 risks. The unrest also comes as corporations have often reported record profits and showered executives with pay increases, stock buybacks and bonuses, while workers received minimal pay increases. Workers at billion-dollar corporations from Dollar General to McDonald‚Äôs still make on average less than $15 an hour while often being forced to work in unsafe, grueling conditions. On 2 May, Dollar General workers at a store in Marion, North Carolina, walked off the job over low wages. Ashley Sierra has worked at Dollar General for two years and makes just $11 an hour, while only receiving part-time hours. A mother of three, she relies on family members to barely make ends meet. ‚ÄúMy weekly paycheck is no more than $200, $260 at the max. I have three children, I cannot survive on $260 a week, it‚Äôs just not working. It needs to get upped to at least $15 an hour, the bottom is $15, because we work so hard for so little,‚Äù said Sierra. Dollar General reported a profit of $3.2bn and their CEO was paid over $16.4m in 2021, 986 times the median pay of the company‚Äôs workers. Sierra said the store was often understaffed and overstocked with items that block aisles, and that she feared for her safety over potential robberies and theft when she and just one other co-worker are working the entire store. Dollar General did not comment on the company‚Äôs low wages. In regards to the walkout, a spokesperson said in an email: ‚ÄúWe understand a small number of employees chose to express their personal opinions about the company earlier this week by walking off the job. We respect our employees‚Äô right to engage in protected activities and as is our practice, we plan to listen, and are listening, to their feedback.‚Äù Workers at a McDonald‚Äôs in Los Angeles began a strike on Monday, 2 May, in response to plumbing issues at the restaurant that recently worsened, emitting odors that have made workers sick. ‚ÄúIt gives me headaches, stomachaches and nausea, and it‚Äôs been happening to my co-workers also,‚Äù said Jasmina Alfaro, one of the striking workers at the McDonald‚Äôs location. ‚ÄúIt has become a horrible smell all over the kitchen and store and we‚Äôve noticed there‚Äôs water also leaking with disgusting debris.‚Äù She explained for the past year a foul odor had been emanating from pipes near the drive thru window, but severely worsened over the past week throughout the entire restaurant. Despite the odor, workers were still expected to conduct business as usual. Alfaro said she had missed days of work due to getting sick from the odor and had not been compensated for that time missed from work. Alfaro said the strike will continue until the problem is fixed, and the issue is an example of why fast-food workers in California need local proposed law AB 257 to pass, which would establish a statewide fast-food council with worker representation to set wage and other industry standards, including safety protections. ‚ÄúThis is the only way we‚Äôre going to have a voice that represents us, so we can be listened to and not be ignored. We shouldn‚Äôt have to risk our health to make a living,‚Äù Alfaro said. A spokesperson for McDonald‚Äôs did not comment on the strike but claimed in an email: ‚ÄúThis restaurant underwent a recent health inspection and was found to be in good standing. We have already begun repairing a plumbing issue that recently arose at the restaurant and expect it to be resolved shortly.‚Äù At a Jack in the Box location in Sacramento, California, workers went on strike for three days at the end of April 2022 over faulty equipment and safety concerns, and short staffing. Workers at a Wendy‚Äôs in Weaverville, North Carolina, went on strike on 23 April through 1 May over sexual harassment and abuse from the restaurant‚Äôs general manager toward employees that upper management had not addressed. Charity Bradley, a Wendy‚Äôs manager at the restaurant, claimed she was retaliated against for reporting complaints about the general management to corporate, as she was taken off the schedule and locked out of the crew app used to communicate with co-workers. Bradley was reinstated by the end of the strike and returned to work on 2 May. Bradley said the strike began the very next day after she was removed from the schedule and the app. ‚ÄúWhen we reported it to upper management, they pretty much just blew it off, they really didn‚Äôt do anything.

5/16/2022,"Labor has pledged more transparent funding to arts and cultural institutions, an examination of a national insurance scheme to protect the live performance sector from further shutdowns, and a plan to force multinational streamers to produce more Australian content, as part of the party‚Äôs detailed arts and culture policy. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, also promised a Labor government would put First Nations art and culture at the forefront of its policies, and, in a symbolic gesture, restore the word ‚Äúarts‚Äù as part of a named government department, if he wins the 21 May election. As he launched the policy under St Kilda‚Äôs Bunurong Corroboree tree (Ngargee tree) in Melbourne on Monday night, Albanese conceded the policy was light on spending announcements ‚Äúdesigned to get me through the week‚Äù. Instead, Labor outlined what its cultural priorities would be to get the sector ‚Äúback on track quickly‚Äù after the devastation caused by Covid-19 lockdowns and event cancellations, and said the party would tailor funding decisions to that cultural policy. ‚ÄúIf we win this Saturday, Australia will have cultural policy reviewed, revived and relaunched this year,‚Äù Albanese promised. According to data from the industry body Live Performance Australia, Covid lockdowns, venue closures and social distancing rules drained an estimated $1.4bn from the national live entertainment industry in 2020 alone. Up until the pandemic hit, Australian arts and culture had contributed about $15bn to the economy annually. The final report from a recent parliamentary inquiry into the creative industries made arts policy its first recommendation, encouraging the government to ‚Äúdevelop a national cultural plan‚Äù. But the Coalition‚Äôs arts minister, Paul Fletcher, dismissed Labor‚Äôs policy announcement as ‚Äújust a plan for a plan‚Äù and said it was conspicuous in its lack of any specific dollar commitment. ‚ÄúWhat on earth have they been doing during nine years in opposition?‚Äù Fletcher said in a statement. ‚ÄúBy contrast, the Morrison government has invested $1bn in the arts and creative sector in the current financial year ‚Äì the largest investment ever by any commonwealth government, Labor or Coalition.‚Äù A significant proportion of that $1bn is one-off Covid-19 emergency funding to keep arts and cultural institutions afloat after the financial devastation of the past two years. In his March 2022 budget, the treasurer Josh Frydenberg confirmed the next $20m tranche of the Restart Investment to Sustain and Expand (Rise) fund to salve the scars of Covid would be the arts sector‚Äôs last, bringing the total rescue package to just over $300m, once the arts sustainability fund is also taken into account. According to the budget‚Äôs forwards estimates, the nation‚Äôs peak arts funding body, the Australia Council, will over the next four years receive a boost of about $3m, which is a 1.5% increase ‚Äì significantly less than the current inflation rate. Earlier this month the Greens released a series of Covid recovery arts policies, based on the prospect of holding the balance of power in a minority Labor government. One of those policies was to extend the Rise scheme, which, under the Coalition, will cease in 12 months. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, and the party‚Äôs arts spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, promised to bring to the negotiating table a national live performance insurance guarantee similar to the one Labor now says it is considering. Bandt said the Greens would push a Labor government to demand global streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney to invest 20% of money earned from Australian subscribers to be spent on Australian content. The last time a major political party launched anything approaching an arts and cultural policy during an election campaign was in 2010, by Labor‚Äôs Julia Gillard, who promised $10m for the Australia Council to invest in up to 150 new artistic works, presentations and fellowships. It took another two and a half years after winning that election for the Labor government to launch its national cultural policy, Creative Australia. Less than five months later the government went into caretaker mode, lost the federal election on 18 September 2013, and the new Coalition government promptly ditched Creative Australia. Within two years, the Australia Council‚Äôs budget was slashed by $105m, (the extricated funds were diverted to the office of the arts minister George Brandis, to be disbursed at his discretion), Screen Australia‚Äôs budget had been reduced three times in 18 months to help pay for a $47.2m lure to Hollywood to bring the production of Thor and Alien films to Australia, the Book Council of Australia had been scrapped, and a further $52.5m had been cut from the Communications and the Arts portfolio. By mid-2016, grants to individual artists and projects had shrunk by 70% over just three years. On Monday, Albanese said Gillard‚Äôs short-lived Creative Australia would be the starting block for Labor‚Äôs new overarching cultural policy. ‚ÄúLast time it took nearly six years to develop Creative Australia,‚Äù he told the gathered arts leaders and practitioners. ‚ÄúAnd within six minutes of the Liberals and Nationals winning it was gone. ‚ÄúThe sector has been through its hardest time ever. We don‚Äôt have six years. So instead of starting with a blank page a Labor government will use Creative Australia as the starting document and immediately work with you to update it.‚Äù",News/Australia news,Labor pledges to get creative industries ‚Äòback on track quickly‚Äô as it announces arts policy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/labor-pledges-to-get-creative-industries-back-on-track-quickly-as-it-announces-arts-policy

5/16/2022,"A debut graphic novel documenting the stories of detainees inside Villawood immigration detention centre has been named book of the year at the New South Wales premier‚Äôs literary awards, lauded by judges as ‚Äúa labour of generosity‚Äù and ‚Äúan unflinching critique of policy‚Äù. Still Alive: Notes from Australia‚Äôs Immigration Detention System by Safdar Ahmed took out the annual literary award‚Äôs top prize, worth $10,000, on Monday night, having also won the $20,000 multicultural category earlier in the evening. Put out by tiny Melbourne publisher Twelve Panels Press, Still Alive is going through a reprint after accruing significant critical acclaim. Ahmed, an artist and writer, first visited Villawood in 2011. While recording video and audio is not allowed in the detention centre, he was able to take his pencils and sketchbooks in. Four years later he won a Walkley award for his web comic Villawood: Notes from an immigration detention centre. Speaking on Monday, before learning he had won book of the year, Ahmed said that it was ‚Äúquite a surprise‚Äù to win the multicutural category. ‚ÄúIt is unusual for a comic or graphic novel to be nominated for a prize like this so I wasn‚Äôt expecting to even be shortlisted to be honest. I am delighted,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think people are still quite unaware just how cruel and punishing Australia‚Äôs policies are against asylum seekers and refugees. I hope this book educates people.‚Äù Ahmed said he would be giving his prize money to his mother: ‚ÄúShe supported me for many years. Creative work is a big struggle as the arts are so underfunded, but on top of that, I have Crohn‚Äôs disease, a chronic illness which has made academic work quite difficult. Mum‚Äôs helped me for many years, so this is a way I can support her.‚Äù The senior judge for the NSW premier‚Äôs Literary awards, Jane McCredie, said that this year‚Äôs judges had ‚Äúgrappled with 750 written works presenting a rich array of genres and styles which explore everything from the major themes of our times to the most intimate details of what it is to be human‚Äù. The judges praised the shortlisted works for ‚Äúprovid[ing] considered and vociferous commentary about the challenges we must urgently address and reflect on as a multicultural nation‚Äù, before naming Still Alive the overall winner ‚Äúfor its vision, ambition and achievement‚Äù. ‚ÄúAhmed‚Äôs work stands out as an example of brilliant storytelling created with and through community, a labour of generosity, and love. It is an unflinching critique of policy and discourse that demonstrates the power of art,‚Äù the judges said. Almost $300,000 was awarded to authors and writers across 12 categories. Author Tony Birch won the $40,000 Christina Stead prize for fiction for his story collection Dark as Last Night, while Kate Holden took out the $40,000 Douglas Stewart prize for nonfiction for The Winter Road: A Story of Legacy, Land and a Killing at Croppa Creek, a true crime book about the 2014 murder of a NSW environment officer.

5/16/2022,"Hungary has been accused of ‚Äúholding the EU hostage‚Äù over its refusal to agree an oil embargo against Russia, as the bloc struggles to reach consensus on its latest sanctions aimed at eroding the Kremlin‚Äôs ability to wage war. Lithuania‚Äôs foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, said: ‚ÄúUnfortunately the whole union is being held hostage by one member state.‚Äù He was referring to Hungary, which continues to block the oil embargo, despite being offered an extension on phasing out Russian crude until the end of 2024. ‚ÄúEverybody expected this will be enough,‚Äù Landsbergis told reporters, reflecting the widespread view that Budapest would fall into line if it got more time to convert its energy system to accommodate non-Russian oil. The EU‚Äôs top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said there were no guarantees the issue would be resolved at a meeting of EU foreign ministers on Monday. ‚ÄúWe will do our best to unblock the situation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI cannot ensure this is going to happen because positions are quite strong.‚Äù Johanna Sumuvuori, Finland‚Äôs junior foreign minister, who said she would update her counterparts on Helsinki‚Äôs bid to join Nato, said on the oil ban: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very important to do our utmost, so that we can make a strong statement as an EU.‚Äù The EU has been unable to agree to its sixth package of sanctions against Russia ‚Äì which includes asset freezes and travel bans on prominent Vladimir Putin supporters ‚Äì 12 days after the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, outlined plans for a Russian oil embargo to come into force at the end of 2022. Since the proposals, EU officials have made a series of concessions. A plan to ban EU ships from transporting Russian oil was dropped, after opposition from Greece and Cyprus, which worried their industries would lose out to competitors. Meanwhile, landlocked countries that are heavily dependent on Russian oil were offered a delay in joining the EU embargo. Hungary and Slovakia were given until the end of 2024, while the Czech Republic has been offered a June 2024 deadline. While Slovakia and the Czech Republic appear ready to sign off the sanctions, Budapest continues to hold out on the oil embargo, which the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb√°n, has likened to an atomic bomb hitting his country‚Äôs economy. Hungary says it needs five years and hundreds of billions of forints to convert its Sz√°zhalombatta refinery near Budapest, which can take only Russian oil. Hungarian officials also say Croatia must boost its capacity to ensure access to alternative supplies. Von der Leyen announced last week that she planned a video conference with Hungary and other countries in the region to work out how to rework Hungary‚Äôs oil supply. No details have been announced since Von der Leyen made that statement. EU foreign ministers, who are meeting in Brussels for talks with Ukraine‚Äôs foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, were never expected to produce a breakthrough on the sanctions hold-up. The 27 ministers are also meeting their Canadian counterpart, M√©lanie Joly, who called for Finland and Sweden‚Äôs speedy accession to Nato.

5/16/2022,"Russia has told Finland and Sweden that their decision to join the Nato military alliance is a serious mistake with far-reaching consequences and that they should not assume that Moscow will not respond. The Finnish government on Sunday confirmed its intention to join Nato while Sweden‚Äôs ruling party agreed to drop its longstanding opposition to the idea, paving the way for a joint membership application within days. The decisions by the two governments, both of which have remained neutral or non-aligned since the end of the second world war, herald a historic redrawing of Europe‚Äôs security map prompted by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. ‚ÄúThe situation is, of course, changing radically in light of what is happening,‚Äù Russia‚Äôs deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said on Monday. ‚ÄúThe fact that Finland and Sweden‚Äôs security will not be strengthened as a result of this is very clear to us.‚Äù Ryabkov added that the two Nordic nations ‚Äúshould have no illusions that we will simply put up with it‚Äù, warning that the move was ‚Äúanother grave mistake with far-reaching consequences‚Äù and the ‚Äúgeneral level of military tension will increase‚Äù. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, also said on Monday that Moscow would ‚Äúfollow very carefully what will be the consequences‚Äù of the Nordic nations‚Äô move ‚Äúfor our security, which must be ensured in an absolutely unconditional manner‚Äù. Russia has repeatedly warned both countries against joining Nato, saying such a move would oblige it to ‚Äúrestore military balance‚Äù by strengthening its defences in the Baltic Sea region, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Finland shares an 810-mile (1,300km) land border with Russia and Sweden a maritime border. Both countries have for decades considered that joining the 30-member, US-led Nato alliance would represent an unnecessary provocation of Moscow. However, Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine on 24 February has led to a profound change in Nordic thinking, with public support for Nato accession in Finland more than trebling to about 75% and rising to between 50% and 60% in Sweden. The Swedish and Finnish parliaments on Monday began debating the issue, with the session in Helsinki likely to last several days. While 85% of Finland‚Äôs 200 MPs back membership, 150 have requested to speak and a vote was not expected on Monday. ‚ÄúOur security environment has fundamentally changed,‚Äù the prime minister, Sanna Marin, told parliament as she opened the debate on Monday. ‚ÄúThe only country that threatens European security, and is now openly waging a war of aggression, is Russia.‚Äù In Stockholm, where the parliamentary vote was also expected to be a formality, the prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, told MPs ‚Äúa historic change in our country‚Äôs security policy‚Äù was underway and that Sweden ‚Äúneeds the formal security guarantees that come with Nato membership‚Äù. She added: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, we have no reason to believe the current trend [of Russia‚Äôs actions] will be reversed in the foreseeable future.‚Äù A formal Swedish government decision to join the alliance is expected later on Monday. The Finnish president, Sauli Niinist√∂, is due in Stockholm on an official visit on Tuesday and Wednesday, suggesting a joint application by the two Nordic neighbours to join the alliance could be formally submitted within the next three days. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said the countries would be ‚Äúwelcomed with open arms‚Äù and their accession would be quick, although Turkish objections could delay the process, which requires unanimity among members. Sweden‚Äôs defence minister, Peter Hultqvist, said on Monday Stockholm was working to overcome Ankara‚Äôs reservations, which centre on Swedish support for the Kurdish PKK group, designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the EU and the US. ‚ÄúWe will send a group of diplomats to hold discussions and have a dialogue with Turkey so we can see how this can be resolved and what this is really about,‚Äù Hultqvist said. Speaking before a meeting with EU foreign ministers in Brussels, the Canadian foreign minister, M√©lanie Joly, called for Finland and Sweden‚Äôs speedy accession. ‚ÄúOur goal is to be amongst the first countries to be able to ratify the accession of Sweden and Finland, because we know that the interim period between the accession demand and the ratification must be shortened,‚Äù she said. Joly added that she had held discussions with Turkey, saying: ‚ÄúWe need to meet this moment, this is historic and it is way more important than any bilateral issues.‚Äù Nato and the US have both said they were confident Turkey would not hold up the Sweden‚Äôs accession. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident we will be able to address the concerns Turkey has expressed in a way that doesn‚Äôt delay the membership,‚Äù Stoltenberg said on Sunday.",News/World news,Russia warns Finland and Sweden joining Nato would be ‚Äògrave mistake‚Äô,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/russia-finland-sweden-nato-ukraine-war
5/16/2022,"The UK government‚Äôs ‚Äújet zero‚Äù plan to eliminate carbon emissions from aviation relies on unproven or nonexistent technology and ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù fuel, and is likely to result in ministers missing their legally binding emissions targets, according to a report. The study from Element Energy, which has worked for the government and the climate change committee in the past, says instead of focusing on such unreliable future developments, ministers should work to reduce the overall number of flights and halt airport expansion over the next few years. The report, released on Monday, was commissioned by the Aviation Environment Federation (AEF) and comes as five regional airports are in the process of seeking approval to expand. In addition, Gatwick and Luton have announced they will be submitting major applications later this year, while Heathrow has not abandoned its plans for a third runway. AEF‚Äôs policy director, Cait Hewitt, said the findings showed the government‚Äôs plan amounted to ‚Äúsitting back and allowing both airports and emissions to grow in the short term while hoping for future technologies and fuels to save the day‚Äù. ‚ÄúThese expansion plans will generate millions of tonnes of additional CO2 each year,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúUntil the government sets out a realistic net zero trajectory for the sector, and the industry is on track to outperform it, additional airport capacity should be off the agenda.‚Äù The government‚Äôs jet zero initiative was launched two years ago and is part of a raft of policies that aim to get UK emissions to net zero by 2050. Boris Johnson announced the proposals, declaring a goal of a commercial transatlantic flight that produces no carbon emissions by 2025, a claim that was widely dismissed by experts as a gimmick. The report adds weight to concerns about the viability of the government‚Äôs plans, stating that it is unclear how the Department for Transport would ‚Äúdeliver the technological improvements‚Äù it was relying on in terms of sustainable fuel and aircraft efficiencies. It concluded that ministers should instead aim to reduce the number of flights now ‚Äì halting airport expansion plans, expanding carbon pricing and taxing frequent flyers and kerosene. Hewitt said: ‚Äú[There is] a need for action now, including ruling out airport expansion and limiting demand, to ensure aviation makes a fair contribution to cutting emissions by 2035 and is on a pathway to net zero by 2050.‚Äù The DFT did not respond to a request for comment.",News/Environment,Johnson‚Äôs ‚Äòjet zero‚Äô plan unrealistic and may make UK miss CO2 targets ‚Äì report,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/16/boris-johnson-jet-zero-plan-unrealistic-co2-targets-report
5/16/2022,"Good morning. As Buffalo, New York, mourns the victims of a mass shooting at a supermarket Saturday that left 10 dead and three wounded, details are emerging about the shooter‚Äôs movements and how the devastating racist attack unfolded. The 18-year-old shooter, who is a self-confessed white supremacist, shot 11 Black and two white victims in a ‚Äúracially motivated hate crime‚Äù authorities said. It plunged the mostly Black Buffalo East Side neighborhood into grief and shock. But the plotting of the attack happened many miles away, had likely been in development for months and even apparently involved a reconnaissance of the targeted area. The shooter is believed to have traveled about 200 miles (320km) from his home of Conklin, New York, to Buffalo but signs of trouble had surrounded him for some time. One year ago, he was the subject of a law enforcement investigation, according to the Buffalo News. Where did the shooter get the gun? Officials have said that the shooter purchased his gun legally in New York. He did not purchase the high-capacity magazine in this state, they said. Meanwhile, California parishioners managed to subdue a gunman who killed one person and wounded five senior citizens. A pastor was able to hit the gunman on the head with a chair and then other parishioners tied him up with electrical cords. The supreme court is ‚Äúdangerous to families and to freedoms in our country‚Äù, Nancy Pelosi said yesterday, as justices prepare to finalize a draft ruling stripping almost half a century of abortion rights in the US. The House speaker railed against conservative judges appointed by the former president Donald Trump in an interview Sunday on CNN‚Äôs State of the Union, in which she urged Democrats to keep their ‚Äúeye on the ball‚Äù to protect other freedoms she sees under threat. ‚ÄúBeware in terms of marriage equality, beware in terms of other aspects,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúUnderstand this. This is not just about terminating a pregnancy. This is about contraception, family planning. ‚ÄúThis is a place where freedom and the kitchen table, issues of America‚Äôs families, come together. What are the decisions that a family makes? What about contraception for young people? It‚Äôs beyond just a particular situation. It‚Äôs massive in terms of contraception, in vitro fertilization, a woman‚Äôs right to decide.‚Äù What did Bernie Sanders say on the subject? He said he remained hopeful that abortion rights legislation could be resurrected before the midterms. ‚ÄúNobody should think this process is dead. We should bring those bills up again, and again and again.‚Äù Russia has attacked positions in eastern Ukraine as it tries to encircle Ukrainian forces in the Donbas and fend off a counteroffensive around the city of Izium. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Russia‚Äôs Donbas offensive had stalled and Ukraine could win the war, an outcome few military analysts predicted at the outset of the conflict. ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs war in Ukraine is not going as Moscow had planned,‚Äù Stoltenberg said. Finland on Sunday confirmed it would apply to join Nato, while Sweden‚Äôs ruling Social Democrats backed Nato membership, paving the way for an application and abandoning decades of neutrality. Nato and the US said they were confident both countries would be accepted and that reservations from Turkey could be overcome ‚Äì it wants them to halt support for Kurdish militant groups present in their territory. How is the Russian invasion going? British military intelligence said Russia had lost about a third of the ground combat force deployed in February, and its Donbas offensive had fallen ‚Äúsignificantly behind schedule‚Äù. What is the US doing to help? Washington has delivered all but one of the 90 artillery pieces it was due to send, according to the US embassy in Kyiv. The US is set to press ahead this week with efforts to send more aid. What else is happening? Here‚Äôs what we know on day 82 of the invasion.

5/16/2022,"A new coalmine proposed for Cumbria is likely to be redundant before it even opens because the steelmakers that are its target market are moving so rapidly away from fossil fuels, analysis from green campaigners claims. Steelmakers across Europe are moving to ‚Äúgreen steel‚Äù, which uses renewable energy and modern techniques to avoid the need for coking coal of the type that the proposed mine in Whitehaven would produce. According to analysis from Friends of the Earth, about three-quarters of EU blast furnace steel-making capacity will reach the end of its life and require reinvestment by 2030. Most of this is likely to be replaced with low-carbon technologies that do not require coking coal. This would vastly restrict the available market for any Cumbrian coal. Tony Bosworth, coal campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: ‚ÄúThe UK steel industry will buy only a small percentage of the Cumbrian coal, and with European steelmakers already moving to greener steel production, the market for this mine is declining before it has even opened. The Whitehaven mine risks becoming a stranded asset, with no market for its coal, and potential consequences for the jobs the developers claim.‚Äù A decision on the Whitehaven mine is due to be made by 7 July, after years of dispute over planning. The proposals were delayed during the UK‚Äôs hosting of the Cop26 UN climate summit last year, when the government risked embarrassment on the world stage by opening a new coalmine while urging other countries to give up coal. Ministers and some Conservative MPs have argued that the Cumbrian mine could go ahead despite the UK‚Äôs climate commitments because it would produce coking coal, rather than coal for use in power stations, which is the main source of greenhouse gas emissions from coal around the world. Coking coal is used mainly by the steel industry, to create the high temperatures and chemical reactions needed to produce high-quality metal. They say the UK‚Äôs steel industry would otherwise need to import coal, with higher emissions than producing it at home. However, analysis by the independent Committee on Climate Change found that about 85% of any coal produced at the Woodhouse Colliery in Whitehaven was likely to be exported. Monday‚Äôs report from Friends of the Earth suggests that even this export market is unlikely to materialise, as steelmakers across Europe are moving rapidly to green production methods. Its analysis found that companies responsible for more than half of the large proportion of EU‚Äôs steelmaking capacity that needs reinvestment by 2030 had already announced plans that would avoid the need for new coking coal. These include announcements by ArcelorMittal that its Sestao site in Spain would be the world‚Äôs first full-scale zero emissions steel plant by 2025, and by Salzgitter, a German steel company, that it would move fully to hydrogen and renewable energy. SSAB in Sweden has also agreed to switch all of its steelmaking in Scandinavia to electric arc furnaces, which do not require coal. For coking coal to be needed, steelmakers would need to take a different route to cutting greenhouse emissions, by planning to use carbon capture and storage alongside traditional techniques, instead of switching to green steel with renewable power. Using carbon capture and storage could be more expensive than opting for renewable energy alternatives, however, and there is some evidence that companies originally considering this route may rethink: for instance, IJmuiden steel plant in the Netherlands will use hydrogen, instead of coking coal with carbon capture and storage. Bosworth said: ‚ÄúWith the world facing a climate emergency, green steel is clearly the future ‚Äì something that any sensible government should embrace. Michael Gove [levelling-up minister] must reject this mine and ensure that areas such as west Cumbria are at the heart of the green industrial revolution that the UK so clearly needs.‚Äù The UK‚Äôs steel industry has already rejected claims that it would require coal from Cumbria. Chris McDonald, the chief executive of the Materials Processing Institute, which serves as the UK‚Äôs national centre for steel research, recently told the Observer there was no demand from his industry for the west Cumbria mine. A government spokesperson said: ‚ÄúThe UK steel sector is committed to decarbonisation, with individual businesses making commercial decisions on how to do so. We are working closely with the steel sector to support its transition to a low carbon future, including through our ¬£315m industrial energy transformation fund.‚Äù",News/Environment,"Cumbria coalmine redundant before it even opens, say campaigners",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/16/cumbria-coalmine-redundant-before-it-even-opens-say-campaigners
