1/18/2022,"Everton’s attempt to rehire Roberto Martínez has hit an immediate problem with the Royal Belgian Football Association rejecting a proposal for their head coach to combine his role with managing the Premier League club. Everton made a formal approach to the Belgian FA for Martínez on Sunday after sacking Rafael Benítez. The former Everton manager, who himself was sacked by majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri in 2016, is keen on a return to Goodison Park but also wants to remain Belgium’s head coach until his contract expires after this year’s World Cup.  The 48-year-old had hoped the Belgian FA would agree to an unusual job share – Belgium have only one international friendly before the end of the Premier League season – but that option was rejected during talks with Everton officials on Monday. Belgium are determined to avoid disruption in the buildup to the World Cup in Qatar and are confident Martínez will not walk out on his contract. The former Swansea and Wigan manager also became Belgium’s technical director when signing a new contract in 2020, with far-reaching responsibilities for football development in the country, and has resisted previous approaches to return to the Premier League. Everton explored the possibility of Martínez taking the job on an interim basis with a final decision that would suit both parties, though not Belgium, at the end of the season. That was also dismissed by the Belgian FA, who have a Nations League campaign in June. Everton will consider other candidates as they look to haul themselves clear of relegation trouble following a dreadful run of one win in 13 Premier League games, although may not have conceded defeat in their pursuit of Martínez. Duncan Ferguson, who had a short but successful spell as caretaker manager following Marco Silva’s dismissal in 2019, could be asked to take interim charge again. The Derby County manager and former Everton striker , Wayne Rooney, and José Mourinho are among the alternative options under consideration by a hierarchy that has struggled to agree on managerial appointments in the recent past.",Sport/Football,Everton’s Roberto Martínez job share proposal rejected by Belgian FA,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/17/evertons-roberto-martinez-job-share-proposal-rejected-by-belgian-fa
1/18/2022,"When announcing the departure of Marcel Brands as director of football on 5 December Everton revealed that: “a strategic review of the football structure will now take place which will inform the best model for the club to proceed with in the long-term.” A clean slate to implement the findings has materialised at a most inopportune moment but Farhad Moshiri must capitalise all the same.  As the threat of a relegation fight grows increasingly real at Goodison Park Everton find themselves lacking not only consensus among the hierarchy, a clear football plan and sufficient character within the dressing room. They also have no director of football following the exit of Brands, eight months after he signed a lucrative three-year contract, no head of recruitment and development nor a manager of scouting and operations after the previous incumbents, Gretar Steinsson and Dan Purdy respectively, decided to leave with the Dutchman. There is no manager either now after results, more than any connection with Liverpool, did for Rafael Benítez. On Monday it was announced his assistant manager Francisco de Miguel Moreno, first team coach and senior analyst Antonio Gómez, head of sports science Jamie Harley and first team rehabilitation coach Cristian Fernández had also left the club with immediate effect. Fernández was hired in October after Benítez’s review into Everton’s medical department and concern over injuries led to Dan Donachie’s exit as director of medical services. “How people treat you is their karma. How you react is yours,” was the Wayne Dyer quote that Donachie tweeted on Sunday, the day Benítez was sacked six months into a three-year contract. That’s another hefty compensation bill loaded on to a club that has been carefully navigating Premier League profit and sustainability rules since last summer. Benítez was never told how tight finances would be when he met Moshiri on board Alisher Usmanov’s yacht in Sardinia to finalise an appointment that had car crash written all over it from the start. Only two people, Benítez and Moshiri, appear to have been convinced otherwise. It has always perplexed why Moshiri, Everton’s billionaire majority shareholder, did not install his own executive upon arriving at the club in 2016 and instead maintained an unsuccessful status quo. Many of Moshiri’s actions have bewildered, from clearly ill-suited managerial appointments to heeding the advice of a few influential agents that have cost him a fortune in bad signings. The recent mass exodus and on-going strategic review offers Moshiri opportunity to demonstrate he does have a plan for bringing to fruition his vision for the club, beyond that of the new stadium currently under construction at Bramley Moore Dock. Growing criticism of an owner upon whom the stadium depends, and at a time when Everton’s Premier League status is far from secure, leaves the club in a precarious position. Everton must pray Moshiri has learned from his mistakes. The early signs are not encouraging. At his final pre-match press conference as Everton manager Benítez refused to comment on claims that the recent signing of Anwar El Ghazi had been imposed on him by the club’s owner. Benítez had wanted a central midfielder. He got a winger from Aston Villa out of the negotiations to sell Lucas Digne instead. Then there is the early move to install Roberto Martínez as Benítez’s replacement. As with several former Everton managers, underwhelming at Goodison has not been an impediment to succeeding elsewhere for Martínez, who has remained close to chairman Bill Kenwright since being sacked by Moshiri in 2016. Everton fans staged sit-in protests calling for the removal of the likeable Belgium head coach, who received a pay-off in excess of £10m after a legal dispute with Moshiri. His would be another divisive appointment and, if led by Kenwright, further evidence of a hierarchy pulling in different directions. Moshiri overlooked Martínez’s claims last summer. Everton’s strategic review should involve the club’s majority shareholder, chairman and fellow board members – excluding Graeme Sharp, who has only just been appointed – holding a mirror to their own performances. Under-achievement predates the arrival of Moshiri and his money. Whatever his failings at Everton, and there were many, Benítez’s insistence that improvement was needed in all departments at the club was not among them. The path is clear for Moshiri to implement the sweeping changes Everton require but, with the team six points above the relegation zone, the priority is to stay afloat. Root-and-branch reviews may have to wait. Everton are seeking their sixth permanent manager in six years. They have to get one right before it’s too late.",Sport/Football,Relegation fears will grow for Everton unless Moshiri learns from mistakes | Andy Hunter,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/17/relegation-fears-will-grow-for-everton-unless-moshiri-learns-from-mistakes
1/18/2022,"Big Dog was having a temper tantrum. He had been hiding out in Downing Street since Wednesday and all anyone was still talking about was the number of parties he had held and how long he could get away with lying about them. It’s just not fair, he had shouted at a member of staff. Why did everyone blame him for everyone in No 10 being pissed more often than not during lockdown when he was merely the person who had been in charge and let it all happen? It wasn’t his fault he was unable to see the difference between working and having a social event. Surely the person who warned him about the party on 20 May should have made a greater effort to get his message across? “We need to move on,” he had said eventually. What was required was a secret plan. Or two secret plans. Operation Save Big Dog and Operation Red Meat. Secret plans that were so secret he was going to make sure everyone knew what they were. First off, he was going to sack however many members of staff were necessary for him to keep his job. Because that was the kind of threat that would be guaranteed to buy the loyalty of everyone in No 10.  And then he was going to offer up some policies he hoped would be catnip to both the rightwing press and the far right of his party. With any luck it would stop them writing letters of no confidence to Graham Brady. Big Dog might even get round to doing a bit of work after that. Then again, why break the habit of a lifetime? Monday saw the plans go into action. At Home Office questions, Priti Patel declared she was going to set the navy on refugees trying to cross the Channel in inflatable boats. She didn’t quite say what she expected the navy to do about them. But hopefully it would find a way of pushing them back to France. Failing that, it could just sink them. A warm glow of pleasure passed through Priti Vacant’s veins as she thought of foreigners fighting for their lives in a gunmetal-grey sea. It was for moments like this that she lived. To be home secretary was very heaven. Next up was Nadine Dorries who, having already announced her plan to freeze the BBC licence fee for two years and then discontinue it from 2028 in the Mail on Sunday and on Twitter, belatedly got round to informing parliament in a statement to the Commons. The BBC had quite enough money to be going on with, people were broke and the licence fee was an outdated business model. Furthermore, it was about time the BBC learned to be a bit more impartial and stop reporting things that were damaging to the government. Stories about corruption and lying at the heart of government had no place in a national broadcaster’s reporting. And while the Beeb was about it, it should get out of its London bubble and stop showing programmes for the metropolitan elite. Shows like Strictly Come Dancing, Doctor Who, David Attenborough and Match of the Day. It was an outrage that no one from the BBC had ever bothered to adapt one of her third-rate books for television. Labour’s Lucy Powell, the shadow culture secretary, wasn’t having any of this. This wasn’t a policy announcement so much as a minor distraction, to prevent Red Meat from becoming Dead Meat. While there should be no blank cheques for the BBC, this really wasn’t about the cost of living. If it was, then the government could have done more to help with energy price rises and tax increases. She could also have mentioned the £20 reduction in universal credit and the £4.3bn the government had written off in fraudulent Covid schemes. So what did Nad expect the BBC to do? Just show repeats or cut its local journalism and regional programming? Or it could just dump its offering for children and Bitesize education? And as for linking the licence fee to editorial content of which the government approved, that was the kind of thing you would expect of a tinpot dicatorship. Nad merely shrugged dismissively. Nobody was thinking of getting rid of the BBC, she said, merely thinking of ways to make it more like Big Dog wanted. Even though Big Dog had been very supportive of the BBC before he went into politics. And no, she hadn’t given a moment’s thought to what funding model might replace the licence fee. All she wanted to do was whip up a distraction by starting a discussion about the BBC’s future. If Dorries had thought she was in for an easy ride from Tory backbenchers grateful for a chance to settle scores with the national broadcaster, she was in for a nasty surprise. Peter Bottomley, the father of the house, reckoned it was just petty to freeze the inflationary increases for the next two years. Damian Green suggested that the least the government should be doing was maintain the licence fee till 2038, but Nad wasn’t having anything to do with it. As Tory after Tory got up to ask about nonprofitable parts of the BBC they admired, Nad became increasingly unhinged. It wasn’t until an hour in that she got unequivocal support from Jonathan Gullis, who declared the Beeb deserved to be dismantled because it hadn’t unequivocally supported Brexit. That’s more like it, Dorries cheered. Operation Red Meat was a success after all. Big Dog could relax. For one more day at least.
