2/20/2022,"The prime minister is to announce the end of the legal duty to self-isolate after testing positive for Covid-19 next week. Downing Street said Boris Johnson will lay out his intentions to repeal all pandemic regulations that restrict public freedoms in England as part of his “living with Covid” plan on Monday.  Johnson will also tell MPs returning to parliament after February recess that the country can rely on the vaccine programme, testing, and new treatments to keep people safe. The prime minister said: “Covid will not suddenly disappear, and we need to learn to live with this virus and continue to protect ourselves without restricting our freedoms. We’ve built up strong protections against this virus over the past two years through the vaccine rollouts, tests, new treatments, and the best scientific understanding of what this virus can do. “Thanks to our successful vaccination programme and the sheer magnitude of people who have come forward to be jabbed, we are now in a position to set out our plan for living with Covid this week.” By the end of the week, local authorities will be required to manage outbreaks with pre-existing public health powers. Pharmaceutical interventions will “continue to be our first line of defence”, with the vaccine programme remaining “open to anyone who has not yet come forward”, Downing Street added. Sir David Spiegelhalter, a professor at Cambridge University, argued that some form of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) study on coronavirus should remain in place regardless of other changes. “It has been absolutely so important as we have gone along,” the non-executive director for the ONS and chairman of the advisory board for the Covid Infection Survey told Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday. “It has been running since April 2020, and so, as I said, I do have a bias here but it is not just me – I think lots of people are saying how important it is, particularly the statistical community.” Meanwhile, the scale of free testing to be retained is still being thrashed out within government this weekend amid a dispute between chancellor Rishi Sunak and health secretary Sajid Javid over the costs. Current data suggests that nearly 4 million people take regular Covid tests, including those who visit and help vulnerable relatives. That number also includes vulnerable people who work in settings that could put them at greater risk, where they have face-to-face contact with others. Research based on the average cost of tests internationally, compiled by the Liberal Democrats, suggests that people who take two tests a week face an average bill of £534 a year. The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, said: “Boris Johnson is declaring victory before the war is over, in an attempt to distract from the police knocking at his door. “Labour doesn’t want to see restrictions in place any longer than they need to be. The government should publish the evidence behind this decision, so the public can have faith that it is being made in the national interest. Now is not the time to start charging for tests or weaken sick pay, when people are still being asked to behave responsibly.”",News/Politics,Johnson to end forced self-isolation after positive Covid test in England,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/19/johnson-to-end-forced-self-isolation-after-positive-covid-test-in-england
2/20/2022,"Abolishing free Covid tests for those who look after the vulnerable will amount to a “tax on caring” that would cost them more than £500 a year, ministers have been warned. All remaining domestic Covid regulations that restrict public freedoms are expected to end this week, with Boris Johnson expected to announce a move away from government intervention to “personal responsibility”. However, the scale of free testing to be retained is still being thrashed out within government this weekend amid a dispute between chancellor Rishi Sunak and health secretary Sajid Javid over the costs. There is also growing anxiety among scientists over the future of the main survey used to monitor Covid in Britain.  Current data suggests that nearly 4 million people take regular Covid tests, including those who visit and help vulnerable relatives. That number also includes vulnerable people who work in settings that could put them at greater risk, where they have face-to-face contact with others. Research based on the average cost of tests internationally, compiled by the Liberal Democrats, suggests that people who take two tests a week face an average bill of £534 a year. It comes after the government’s own scientific advisers have warned that removing free testing will “increase anxiety” and limit the “social participation outside the home” of those who are clinically vulnerable or who live with someone in that position. “Charging people for the tests they need to safely see vulnerable loved ones is a tax on caring that risks leaving millions of people in lockdown by stealth,” said Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader. “It means vulnerable people will see fewer loved ones and will be able to enjoy less of their lives. It is unfair and unjust. Ministers need to scrap these plans to stop a ‘cost of living with Covid’ crisis. Throughout the pandemic, people have been trying hard to do the right thing and keep others safe. The government should not be making that harder.” Professor Graham Medley, Sage’s chief Covid modeller, said that it was a “good time to take stock” on what might be needed to help the country in another pandemic or Covid wave. “The main purpose of making tests for infection freely available to the UK population is so that people can make individual decisions about their risks to themselves and others,” he said. “If we deprive people of testing then the population will not be able to make informed choices.” He also warned against scrapping the Office for National Statistics (ONS) survey that monitors Covid infections: “The Covid-19 Infection Survey (CIS) surveillance is the best way we have of knowing what the virus is doing in the community – if this is removed then we will largely be ‘flying blind’. Governments have to make decisions from multiple perspectives. Testing and the CIS are expensive. But we will need them again at some point in the future and need to be able to restart them quickly.” Johnson, who is facing pressure from the right of his party over his leadership and the continuation of coronavirus restrictions, said that while Covid would not disappear, “we need to learn to live with this virus and continue to protect ourselves without restricting our freedoms. “We’ve built up strong protections against this virus over the past two years through the vaccine rollouts, tests, new treatments and the best scientific understanding of what this virus can do,” he said. “Thanks to our successful vaccination programme and the sheer magnitude of people who have come forward to be jabbed, we are now in a position to set out our plan for living with Covid this week.” The chief executive of NHS Providers, Chris Hopson, said ministers should think hard before abandoning the Covid surveillance measures that have been “key parts of our defence”.“One of the distinguishing features of the pandemic has been our inability to predict its course,” he said. “While NHS trust leaders recognise the ongoing cost of [testing and surveillance] regimes, they are clear that the government should err strongly on the side of caution before dismantling or scaling them back.” Government pressure to dismantle the Covid surveillance system is already taking a toll on local authorities. The national contact tracing service may also be abolished and responsibility for tracing contacts of infected people will lie solely with local authorities. That work was funded by the £400m Contain Outbreak Management Fund, which is due to end next month and the Treasury appears unlikely to renew. The lack of secure funding means some councils have already let staff go. If no further money becomes available, vital services are under threat including contact tracing, testing for care homes and schools and surge testing for new variants. Business leaders are also worried that getting rid of testing and Covid self-isolation measures will create more tension and disputes in workplaces. HR directors taking part last week in a focus group run by the CIPD, the association of HR professionals, said they were concerned that if free testing ends, employees who only receive the statutory sick pay of £96.35 a week – among the lowest rates in Europe – will go to work while infectious. Lower-paid workers and those vital for supply chains are often only entitled to the minimum statutory sick pay. Ben Willmott, CIPD’s head of public policy, said: “There are real costs, hidden costs of not paying statutory sick pay at a reasonable rate. People can’t afford to live on £96 a week so they end up falling out of employment. The onus is likely to shift to employers to decide how best to manage the risk of Covid in the workplace. There is a lot of desire for clarity [from government] and it would be useful to have updated guidance from the Department of Health and Social Care.”",News/World news,Ministers warned getting rid of free Covid tests will lead to £500 ‘caring tax’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/ministers-warned-getting-rid-of-free-covid-tests-will-lead-to-500-caring-tax
2/20/2022,"Look at Wolves go. They are this season’s most unlikely contenders for a top-four finish and could boost their chances on Sunday by winning at home to Leicester. Bruno Lage deserves high praise. So does the manager’s little brother. Luis Nascimento, at 42 three years younger than his more prominent sibling, was one of the six backroom staff members brought to Molineux after Lage’s appointment in June. Lage had collaborated with each of them before but had never worked directly with his brother, whose career has largely mirrored his own.  Nascimento’s official title is Wolves’ senior professional development coach but he is nicknamed “Il Capitano” after Capitano Nascimento, the lead character of the 2007 Brazilian movie Tropa de Elite, about a no-nonsense policeman tasked with cleaning Rio de Janeiro of drug gangs before a visit by the pope. “He is different to me, he is more serious,” says the jovial Lage, explaining the tag was coined by Carlos Carvalhal, under whom they served as assistant manager: Lage at Swansea and Sheffield Wednesday between 2015 and 2018 and then, in 2019, Nascimento at Rio Ave in Portgual. “He has had the same pathway as me,” says Lage about his brother. “I went to Benfica in 2004, he went in 2005. We worked together but not in the same teams. When I was at the under-15s, he was working with the under-11s. But the good thing is we shared experiences between us. Then, after I went to Dubai [in 2012], and then also with Carlos, if I was doing something new – a new exercise or idea – I would share with him and he would try it with the kids. Similarly, he would share experiences with me. After I left Carlos’s staff, Carlos invited him and it was very good. He is a top professional. When I came to Wolves I thought: ‘I need one more person to work with me because I want to control everything.’” He may want to control everything but Lage seems to take genuine pleasure in talking about the contribution others have made to Wolves’ success this season. He does not feel threatened by the expertise of others; he thrives off it. “All my staff, not just Luis, know they have the freedom to do their work. I have specialists and they understand the way I want to work. I have Luis doing some things, I have Alex [Silva, assistant head coach] doing some things, Carlos [Cachada, fitness coach] doing things and Tony [Roberts] doing the work I want to do with the goalkeeper and I have two analysts (Jhony Conceição and Diogo Camacho]. Then I receive all the information from them to take the best decisions. “We control everything. In some things they are better than me, that’s why I invited them to be here with me. There are too many things to know, I need top guys with me to be a better manager.” Nascimento’s role is to prepare training sessions. “This is the big responsibility he has,” says Lage. “To try to look at all the information on the opponent. Like how can Leicester play against us with three or two midfielders. We try to create scenarios and prepare those things. It’s teamwork. I’m just one of them. I’m the manager, I have the big salary but they are the same level as me.” Leicester beat Wolves 1-0 on the opening day of the season but the teams have gone in opposite directions since then. That is partly because of injuries – Leicester will be without their entire first-choice defence again on Sunday whereas Wolves will be at full strength for the first time this season. But it is also because Wolves have grown slicker and tighter. They still need to improve their finishing but they could hardly defend better, since only Manchester City have conceded fewer goals in the Premier League this season. When opponents have managed to pierce Wolves’ defence, they usually been thwarted by José Sá, who has the best shots-to-save ratio of any goalkeeper who has played regularly in the league this season. Again, Lage is quick to hail the people who work with him. “In modern football the goalkeeper has a massive influence and José gives us that,” he says. “When you start buildups from the back, you need to take the best decisions with where you pass the ball. Also, when you want to try to press more high it’s important that the keeper comes out of the box to control the space behind the defenders. The way Tony Roberts works with him is improving those skills. I’ve known José since he was 16-17 and he has the same mentality. His career is about steps and he conquers with the right work. He is in a good moment and he needs to continue.” That is the message Lage keeps drumming into the whole squad with talk of a top-four challenge. “My ambition is for the team to play in the next 15 games with the character we played against Tottenham,” he says of last Sunday’s 2-0 win. “I want that solid personality. That’s the only thing we can control. Don’t relax with what we have.”",Sport/Football,Family fortunes: Bruno Lage happy to have brother assist Wolves’ rise,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/19/family-fortunes-bruno-lage-happy-to-have-brother-assist-wolves-rise
2/20/2022,"They can seem more Manchester Disunited than Manchester United: an underachieving club with a mismatched group of players, capable of squandering a colossal budget and letting points slip through their grasp. An interim manager halfway through a temporary reign that has taken on an underwhelming feel denying he will remove the captaincy from Harry Maguire and reject reports of dressing room divides. But Ralf Rangnick delivered a staunch defence of his tenure, arguing performances are on an upward graph and that if United continue at their current rate of progress they are likely to qualify for the Champions League, and pointing to the difficulties with his inheritance. Rangnick argued he is more solution than problem; that, incrementally, his methods are working. They have drawn three of their past four matches, but he has taken encouragement.  “We have won six [league] games, drawn four and had one defeat against Wolves; that was one of the worst games we played,” he said. “Since then it’s obvious that the team has developed, that we control, not for 90 minutes, but for larger parts of the game. We are dominating and controlling games.” If Brighton were dominant and in control for the opening 45 minutes on Tuesday, United nevertheless won 2-0 and although a 90-minute performance remains their holy grail, Rangnick detects a rise in belief. “To me, it’s obvious speaking regularly to the players that they feel confident and strong on the pitch as a team. We have shown some improvement in the weeks and months, but there is still space for more in the future.” If he made his name with a high-pressing blueprint, he believes he has built from the back. United conceded 21 goals in 12 league games under Ole Gunnar Solskjær – when only Norwich and Newcastle had worse records – and eight in Rangnick’s 11. “We had to reduce the number of goals conceded, which we did,” he said. That is in part because David de Gea has made the most saves in the division. “I would love to be with a team that has allowed the fewest amount of shots on our goal but that is not the case,” Rangnick said. If De Gea’s season has amounted to a damage-limitation exercise, perhaps Rangnick’s salvage job has certain similarities. In each case, it may be rendered tougher by the personnel around them. “The challenge for me was in coming mid-season at a time when the team was lacking confidence and not doing well,” he said. “And to work with a group that was not put together by me; that’s not alibis or excuses, just a mere fact.” United’s false start to the season has left them playing catch-up. Rangnick was a voice of caution. “Everybody wants to play in the Champions League every season, but we have to be realistic,” he said. “I think when I came we were eighth in the table, trailing by quite a few points.” They were 10th before the caretaker Michael Carrick’s parting gift, victory over Arsenal, lifted them to seventh. Rangnick has taken them higher again, procuring 22 points from 11 matches. “If you win two points [per game] on average in the whole season you are probably finishing in the top four and qualifying for the Champions League,” he said. “Right now, we have played 11 games, we have another 13 left and if you ask me now if I would be happy with another two points on average in those 13 games, I would probably say yes.” Two points a match from hereon would take United to 69 and if Rangnick applied a caveat – that football “is not mathematics” – there is another. The fixture list may have made his record flattering. Those 11 matches have not pitched United against any of the so-called big six. March brings three such meetings. The stakes are about to get higher, the opponents tougher, the need for United to excel from first to last whistle much greater. “One thing is to know the gameplan, the other is to transform it and translate it on to the pitch,” Rangnick said. “Hopefully we can do for that for more than 45 minutes or 60 minutes; for the whole game.”",Sport/Football,Rangnick insists he is more solution than problem at Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/19/rangnick-insists-he-is-more-solution-than-problem-at-manchester-united
