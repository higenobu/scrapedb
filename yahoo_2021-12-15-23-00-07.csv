12/15/2021,"Tom Brady said he follows the 80/20 rule, meaning 80% of his plate is plant-based and 20% is meat. This is one of Brady's lifestyle habits that have allowed him to play in the NFL at the age of 44. Nutritionists say that following the 80/20 rule might be even healthier than being a full vegan. Tom Brady follows the 80/20 rule — meaning 80% of his dish is plant-based, made up of vegetables or rice and grains, and the other 20% is made up of leane protein, like wild-caught fish or organic chicken. Brady, who is currently leading the NFL in passing yards and touchdowns at the age of 44, uses this diet to stay fit as he gets older, according to a post on his personal wellness brand TB12. Veganism is known to offer health benefits like improvements to gut health, reduced inflammation, and lowered risk of certain diseases, according to the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine. But it can cause complications as well. For one, it makes getting dependable sources of protein more difficult, it can deprive the body of vitamins like calcium and iron. In extreme circumstances over time, vegans who do not have a healthy balance of vitamins in their diet can have an increased the risk of stroke, according to WebMD. Brady's strategy of adding 20% meat and fish into his diet is one very effective tactic to remedy many of these risks, registered dietitian Alix Turoff told Insider. It creates a healthy compromise that results in most of the benefits of veganism with fewer drawbacks and less arduous planning. Turoff said she generally doesn't recommend veganism to her clients because it's difficult to eat healthy while vegan and get good sources of protein. Brady's approach is a good one, Turoff said, because it is an easy way to incorporate that benefits of some animal-based protein while still emphasizing vegetables and plant-based carbs as the main source of calories and nutrients. ""I think we can all agree that adding more plants to our diet is always a good idea but that doesn't mean being full plant based is necessary,"" Turoff told Insider. ""Especially for someone like Tom Brady who's protein needs are going to be very high with his activity level!"" Kris Solid, a registered dietitian who is also the senior director of nutrition communications at the International Food Information Council, said that people should generally try to include more plant-based foods into their diet, but a diet of only plants isn't necessarily healthier than a diet that includes meat and fish as well. Solid classifies Brady's diet as a ""flexitarian diet"" which is a semi-vegetarian, plant-forward diet that incorporates dairy and eggs and allows room for meat from time to time. ""The emphasis on plant foods is thought to contribute to the health benefits associated with a vegetarian diet without requiring compliance to a 100% vegetarian or vegan diet,"" Solid told Insider. ""A flexitarian diet, as its name implies, allows for flexibility while striving to slowly increasing fruit and vegetable intake over time without eliminating animal foods.""

12/15/2021,"A Henrietta woman at the center of a controversy involving the Clay County sheriff has won a judgement against a Wichita Falls strip club in a different legal setting, according to court records. Sarah Lynn Johnson, 29, was awarded $88,425 in a labor lawsuit against Bombshells' Topless club in federal court, according to court filings. Johnson accused Bombshells' owner David A. Brooks and his company, North Texas Dancers, of wrongly classifying her and other female dancers as independent contractors, court filings show. 'A ham sandwich': Sheriff Jeff Lyde blames judge for 'fiasco' that led to oppression charges The topless dancers did not receive hourly wages since they were classified as contractors instead of employees — plus they had to pay a house fee for each shift, according to court filings. This setup violated the Fair Labor Standards Act, according to court filings. Johnson was awarded $44,212.50 for unpaid wages and $44,212.50 for damages in a May 24 judgement, court records show. Efforts to collect the judgement continued when a U.S. deputy marshal served Brooks on Dec. 9, court filings show. Johnson filed the lawsuit against the club's parent company, North Texas Dancers, on Sept. 8, 2020, in a Wichita Falls federal court. She worked as a dancer from about May 2014 through March 2020 at Bombshells' and the company's after-hours strip club, located at the same property and called The Alibi or Vudu Lounge, according to court filings. Not only did North Texas Dancers fail to pay wages for hours worked, but the company also required them to hand over a house fee or kickback ranging from $20 to $50 for each shift to the owner or management, according to the lawsuit. Brooks and North Texas Dancers denied the allegations, according to court filings. Johnson sought minimum wages, damages, attorneys' fees and court costs, court records show. The lawsuit allowed other dancers employed by the company to opt in, but court records did not show any others joining Johnson's lawsuit. More: Why were Clay County Sheriff Jeff Lyde's accusers arrested? Here's what we know Brooks' attorney, Mark Barber, withdrew from representing him because his client didn't cooperate in his own defense, according to court records filed by Barber. Brooks failed to hire a new lawyer, so on April 2, U.S. Judge Reed O'Connor directed Johnson to ask for a judgement, which he granted, court documents show. Johnson is also one of Clay County Sheriff Jeff Lyde's accusers. Lyde is accused of intentionally jailing Johnson and her boyfriend, 33-year-old Landon Paul Goad, for over 48 hours without a finding of probable cause from a magistrate, according to allegations in court records. A Clay County grand jury indicted Lyde on two charges of official oppression in connection with July 10 incidents, court records show. Lyde maintains his innocence. He blames a local magistrate for the situation that led to Johnson and Goad's overlong stay in jail without probable cause findings. The magistrate, Clay County Justice of the Peace John Swenson, wrote a letter to a district attorney that led to an investigation and indictments against Lyde.

12/15/2021,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The U.S. Navy announced Wednesday it tested a laser weapon and destroyed a floating target in the Mideast, a system that could be used to counter bomb-laden drone boats deployed by Yemen's Houthi rebels in the Red Sea. The test Tuesday saw the USS Portland test-fire its Laser Weapon System Demonstrator at the target in the Gulf of Aden, the body of water separating East Africa from the Arabian Peninsula. The Navy’s Mideast-based 5th Fleet described the laser as having “successfully engaged” the target in a statement. Previously, the Portland used the laser to bring down a flying drone in May 2020. The Gulf of Aden sits along the southern coast of war-torn Yemen, which has been at war since Iranian-backed Houthi rebels seized its capital, Sanaa, in 2014. A Saudi-led coalition entered the conflict in March 2015 but the stalemate conflict has dragged on for years, becoming the world's worst humanitarian disaster and killing an estimated 110,000 people. The war also has bled into the surrounding waterways, like the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb, which connects the sea to the Gulf of Aden. These waterways lead to the Suez Canal and onto the Mediterranean Sea, making them crucial for international shipping and global energy supplies. The Houthis have deployed drone boats into these waters, which can be piloted remotely and sent up to a target before detonating. These boats are suspected of being built with Iran's help. Emirati officials in 2018 showed off footage they described as coming from a drone boat computer that had Iranians building components for the boat’s guidance system, with a hat visible in the background of one picture bearing the symbol of Iran’s hard-line paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. Iran has denied arming the Houthis, though United Nations experts, independent analysts and Western nations point to evidence showing Tehran's link to the weapons. The Portland, a San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock, has its home port in San Diego. The ship is deployed as part of the Essex Amphibious Ready Group that's now in the Mideast. ___ Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.",World/Associated Press,US Navy fires laser weapon in Mideast amid drone boat threat,https://news.yahoo.com/us-navy-fires-laser-weapon-104908712.html
12/15/2021,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Kim Yong Ju, the younger brother of North Korea founder Kim Il Sung who was once regarded as the country’s No. 2 official before his nephew was anointed as the next ruler, has died, state media reported Wednesday. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the grandson of Kim Il Sung, expressed “deep condolences” over the death and sent a condolence wreath, the official Korean Central News Agency reported. “Kim Yong Ju devotedly struggled to implement the (Workers') Party’s lines and policies and made a contribution to accelerating socialist construction and developing the Korean-style state social system, while working at important posts of the party and the state for many years,” the KCNA dispatch said. The news report didn’t say exactly when Kim Yong Ju died. According to Seoul’s Unification Ministry, he was born in 1920, meaning that he was either 100 or 101 at the time of his death. Three generations of the Kim family have ruled North Korea since Kim Il Sung established the country in 1948. When Kim Il Sung died in 1994, his eldest son, Kim Jong Il, inherited power. Kim Jong Un is the third and youngest son of Kim Jong Il and assumed power upon his father’s death in 2011. During Kim Il Sung’s rule, many outside experts viewed Kim Yong Ju as the North’s second most powerful official or even his brother’s heir apparent. He held a slew of top posts such as director of the organization and guidance department and member of the Politburo, both at the ruling Workers’ Party. In 1972, he represented North Korea in signing a landmark peace accord with South Korea, the rivals’ first major joint communique on unification. Kim Yong Ju gradually faded from the political scene after Kim Jong Il took over his Workers’ Party department director post in 1973, a move seen by outsiders as a key step in the path to succeeding Kim Il Sung. Kim Jong Il’s position as successor was made public at a party congress in 1980. After nearly two decades of seclusion, Kim Yong Ju was made a vice president and regained his Politburo membership in 1993. The appointment came after Kim Jong Il had secured his status as the next leader, and experts said Kim Yong Ju didn’t wield substantial power in key state affairs. He later served as honorary vice-chairman of the standing committee of the Supreme People’s Assembly, the North’s rubberstamp parliament, and as a delegate to the Assembly. Before Wednesday’s report on his death, his last known public activity was in 2015, when state TV showed him bowing before the portraits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il after casting a ballot during local elections.",World/Associated Press,"Kim Yong Ju, younger brother of North Korea's founder, dies",https://news.yahoo.com/kim-yong-ju-younger-brother-080355002.html
12/15/2021,"James and Jennifer Crumbley appeared in court Tuesday for a probable cause hearing. They are each charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter in connection to the Oxford High School shooting. James Crumbley mouthed ""I love you"" to his wife during the hearing. The father of the Oxford, Michigan, high school shooting suspect mouthed ""I love you"" to his wife during an in-court conference for their probable cause hearing on Tuesday. James Crumbley and his wife, Jennifer Crumbley, are each charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter in connection to the Oxford high school shooting that left four students dead and seven others injured. Their son, a 15-year-old student at the school, is the sole suspect in the shooting. The couple sat with their lawyers between them during the hearing, but James Crumbley was seen mouthing words to to Jennifer Crumbley when both lawyers approached the judge for a private discussion, according to video of the conference watched by Insider. The parents, who were arrested in the basement of a commercial building in Detroit on December 4, are accused of not taking any steps to prevent the shooting. The Crumbleys reportedly bought their son the gun he is accused of using in the shooting as a Christmas gift, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald has said. McDonald also said that Jennifer Crumbley previously ignored calls and emails from Oxford High School officials after her a teacher reported that the Crumbleys' son had been looking up ammunition on his phone during class. On the morning of the shooting, the Crumbleys met with school officials after a teacher saw their son writing concerning notes in class. The Crumbleys refused to take their son home and instead urged the school to send him back to class, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said that when Jennifer Crumbley later heard there was an active shooter at Oxford High School, she texted her son ""don't do it."" Judge Julie Nicholson postponed the Crumbleys' probable cause hearing to February 8 at the request of both the prosecutors and the defense team. The later hearing will determine whether the Crumbley's will face a trial for their charges. The Crumbleys' lawyer did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.
