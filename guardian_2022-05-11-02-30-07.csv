5/11/2022,"Vladimir Putin could view the prospect of defeat in Ukraine as an existential threat to his regime, potentially triggering his resort to using a nuclear weapon, the top US intelligence official has warned. The warning on Tuesday came in an assessment from intelligence chiefs briefing the Senate on worldwide threats. The prediction for Ukraine was a long, gruelling war of attrition, which could lead to increasingly volatile acts of escalation from Putin, including full mobilisation, the imposition of martial law, and – if the Russian leader felt the war was going against him, endangering his position in Moscow – even the use of a nuclear warhead. The grim forecast came on a day of continued fighting in the east and south of Ukraine, and Russian missile attacks on the port of Odesa, with the UN conceding that the civilian death toll from the war is likely to be far higher than the current official estimate of 3,381. The director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, told the Senate armed services committee that Putin would continue to brandish Russia’s nuclear arsenal in an attempt to deter the US and its allies from further support for Ukraine. The shift of focus to the east and the south are most likely a temporary tactic rather than a permanent scaling back of war aims, she said. The Russian leader would not use a nuclear weapon until he saw an existential threat to Russia or his regime, Haines argued. But she added that he could view the prospect of defeat in Ukraine as constituting such a threat. “We do think that [Putin’s perception of an existential threat] could be the case in the event that he perceives that he is losing the war in Ukraine, and that Nato in effect is either intervening or about to intervene in that context, which would obviously contribute to a perception that he is about to lose the war in Ukraine,” Haines told the committee hearing. She added that the world would be likely to have some warning that nuclear use was imminent. “There are a lot of things that he would do in the context of escalation before he would get to nuclear weapons, and also that he would be likely to engage in some signaling beyond what he’s done thus far before doing so,” Haines said. That signalling could include a further large-scale nuclear exercise involving the substantial dispersal of mobile intercontinental missiles, heavy bombers and strategic submarines. The assessment the US intelligence chiefs laid out for the senators suggested that Ukraine was faced with the prospect of a war of attrition. They said Putin intended to conquer the Luhansk and Donetsk regions plus a buffer zone around them, to secure a land bridge to Ukraine. He wanted to hold Kherson, north of Crimea, to secure the water supply to the peninsula. However, his ambitions did not stop there. Haines said there were “indications” that Putin wants to extend the land bridge as far as Transnistria, the Moscow-occupied region of Moldova, thereby controlling all of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast. Haines said, however, that Putin would face an uphill task, and that the extension of the land bridge to Transnistria, including the capture of Odesa, would not be possible without a full mobilisation. She added that the capture of the Donbas plus a buffer zone was unlikely in the next few weeks. The head of the Defence Intelligence Agency, Lt General Scott Berrier, said that the US believed that between eight and 10 Russian generals had been killed so far in the conflict. Like Haines, Berrier predicted a stalemate, with neither side able to achieve a breakthrough. But a decision by Putin to order a full mobilisation in Russia, ushered in by a formal declaration of war, could change the military balance. “If they do mobilise, and they do declare war, that’ll bring thousands more soldiers to the fight,” Berrier said. “And even though they may not be as well trained and competent, they will still bring mass and a lot more ammunition.” Despite all the setbacks, Haines said Putin was probably convinced that Russia ultimately had more stamina than Ukraine and its backers. “He is probably counting on the US and EU resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse,” she said. Given Putin’s conviction he could ultimately prevail, and the fact that Ukraine showed no signs of giving in, Haines said US intelligence agencies “do not see a viable negotiating path forward, at least in the short-term”. Meanwhile, as the war of attrition continued, the conflict was likely to take “a more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory”. “The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means, including imposing martial law, reorienting industrial production, or potentially escalatory military actions to free up the resources needed to achieve his objectives as the conflict drags on, or if he perceives Russia is losing in Ukraine,” Haines said. The most likely flashpoint in the coming weeks, she added, would be escalating Russian attempts to intimidate the west to stop weapons supplies into Ukraine and possible retaliation for western economic sanctions or perceived threats to Putin’s regime at home.",News/World news,US intelligence chief warns of nuclear risk if Putin perceives ‘existential threat’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/putin-nuclear-weapons-us-intelligence-avril-haines
5/11/2022,"Sundiata Acoli, 85, the oldest former member of the Black Panthers still to be incarcerated for acts of violence during the 1970s Black liberation struggle, is finally to be released from prison after the New Jersey supreme court ruled that he was no longer a risk to public safety. Acoli has been held captive for more than 49 years for the May 1973 shooting of New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster. He was found guilty the following year and sentenced to life plus 24 to 35 years. The supreme court noted in its ruling that under the terms of his sentence, Acoli first became eligible for parole 29 years ago. On each occasion that he came before the panel his release was denied. Yet for more than a quarter of a century his prison record has been “exemplary”, the judges said. He had completed 120 courses while in prison, participated in counseling, had a constructive rapport with prison staff and fellow inmates, and had positive evaluations from prison officials. Twelve years ago, a state-assigned psychologist assessed Acoli’s progress in prison and concluded that he was deeply remorseful for Foerster’s death and that it was “time to seriously consider him for parole”. Despite that, his parole was denied; in his latest parole hearing he was still being classified a potential danger to society. The parole board had “lost sight that its mission largely was to determine the man Acoli had become”, the supreme court judges concluded. It added that his age, at 85, was another important factor that the board had failed to consider given that elderly people released from prison have extremely low rates of reoffending. Acoli, whose given name was Clark Edward Squire, was involved in an encounter with Foerster and another state trooper, James Harper, on 2 May 1973 after the car he was in was stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike for a broken taillight. He was traveling with two other members of the Black Liberation Army, Assata Shakur (previously JoAnne Chesimard) and Zayd Malik Shakur (James Costan). In the ensuing melee, shots were fired, killing Foerster and Shakur. Harper was wounded and Acoli and Assata Shakur, also wounded, were arrested after a police chase. In his defense, Acoli said that he was shot in the crossfire and had blacked out. When he came to, he found Foerster’s body on the ground nearby. Acoli was one of at least 12 former members of the Black Panthers and their armed wing, the Black Liberation Army, who are still in prison. Many are now approaching, or exceeding, half a century behind bars. Last year Acoli wrote to the Guardian, describing himself as an old man “who’s been imprisoned since age 36 for almost 50 years, who now poses a threat not even to a flea, let alone public safety. My sentence is obviously too long. I am rapidly disintegrating before my family and friends’ eyes.” Soffiyah Elijah, a civil rights attorney and a lead advocate for Acoli, said that it was time now for him “to live the rest of his life in the loving care of his family and community”. She added that she hoped his release would bring attention “to the thousands of elders like him trapped in the New Jersey prison system”. Though Acoli’s release brings to a conclusion one of the unfinished stories of the Black Panther era, in another regard the narrative remains unresolved. After her arrest alongside Acoli in 1973, Assata Shakur escaped and fled to Cuba, where she has been granted asylum by the Cuban government. She remains on the FBI’s most wanted list as a “domestic terrorist”, with a $2m reward on offer for information that leads to her capture.",News/World news,Former Black Panther Sundiata Acoli released from prison after 49 years,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/sundiata-acoli-black-panthers-released-prison
5/11/2022,"A paedophile has been jailed for 10 years after using social media to groom children. Rachel Fenton, who police said was known as Richard Fenton when arrested and charged, pleaded guilty to 21 child sexual abuse offences and a drug offence and was sent to a male prison. The Guardian understands Fenton was living as a man when arrested in November 2020 and was later charged under that name. But during the sentencing hearing on Monday, Manchester Minshull Street crown court heard Fenton had changed their name and was in the process of transitioning to become a woman. A spokesperson for Greater Manchester police (GMP) said the force first heard about Fenton’s transition in a pre-sentence report in April. Fenton, from Wythenshawe, was first arrested in November 2020 after an online vigilante group contacted police. They said they had been communicating with Fenton by posing as a 12-year-old girl. Fenton tried to incite the girl to engage in sexual activity and send videos, not knowing it was a fake profile. Fenton sent indecent images to the profile and tried to encourage the “child” to engage in sexual activity with an even younger child, aged six. Police arrested Fenton in November 2020 on suspicion of arranging a child sexual offence and on suspicion of possession of a class A controlled drug and possession of cannabis. Around the same time, Fenton had also been in contact with the profile of another 12-year-old girl that was controlled by law enforcement. Fenton had contacted the undercover officer and carried on conversation of a sexual nature even after the believed victim revealed her young age. Fenton sent indecent images to the operative and tried to incite the believed child to meet to engage in sexual activity and to send indecent images of herself. After arrest, Fenton breached bail by inappropriately contacting a third “child”, who was in fact another undercover operative using a fake profile of a 13-year-old girl. Fenton requested inappropriate images of the girl and again tried to incite the child to meet to engage in sexual activity. Police arrested Fenton in January 2021 on suspicion of a number of child sexual abuse offences. Fenton’s devices were seized and forensic examination found multiple indecent images of children, including a large number of child sexual abuse images and images of young children. DC Ceri Martin from GMP’s sexual crime unit said: “Fenton is a paedophile who knowingly attempted to exploit children for his own sexual gratification. This behaviour is deplorable and completely unacceptable. The safety of our children is a top priority in Greater Manchester and I hope today’s sentencing spreads the message to anyone thinking of engaging in this type of behaviour that it will not be tolerated. “GMP will do their absolute utmost to thoroughly investigate all reports of this type of crime and bring the perpetrators to justice.” Fenton has been in a male prison on remand since January 2021.",News/UK news,Paedophile jailed after trying to groom children on social media,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/10/paedophile-jailed-trying-groom-children-social-media
5/11/2022,"A Canadian lawmaker has apologized after he was caught logging on to a closed parliamentary session from a toilet stall. Liberal party member Shafqat Ali participated in a hybrid session of parliament last Friday, joining with a Zoom-like feed visible only to other parliamentarians. But Conservative members grew suspicious of his surroundings. Conservative MP Laila Goodridge told the House of Commons that a lawmaker “might be participating in a washroom” somewhere inside parliament – an allegation that baffled the Speaker of the House until it was confirmed by parliamentary pages. On Monday, the Conservative House leader, John Brassard, told parliament that after studying the stonework, door hinges and coat hook, lawmakers had concluded Ali had placed his camera “on the ledge or ridge on the wall just above the back of the toilet”. “The member of parliament was literally using the washroom while participating in a sitting of the House of Commons, the cathedral of Canadian democracy,” he said. “I can’t believe I actually just said those words, Madame Speaker.” Ali apologized, calling the incident from a toilet stall in the building’s West Block an “unfortunate event” that arose from a lapse in judgment. “I take this matter extremely seriously, and I promise never to repeat this error again,” he said. The deputy House speaker, Chris D’Entremont, said Ali’s apology was sufficient enough to close the matter – but warned MPs “to always be vigilant” when participating remotely. “If you don’t have to have the camera on, turn it off,” D’Entremont said. “If you don’t have to be in voting, turn it off.’ The bathroom stall incident is the second time the Liberals have been embarrassed by the conduct of a party member participating in parliament remotely. In 2021, Will Amos was spotted naked on camera while changing after a run. He apologized, but then later admitted to urinating in a mug while attending a committee session. He said he would “seek assistance”” and did not run in last year’s federal election.",News/World news,Ordure! Ordure!

5/11/2022,"Rishi Sunak has moved to weaken regulation of financial services brought in after the 2008 crash amid fears he is aiming to make London into a post-Brexit “Singapore-on-Thames” pushed by Tory donors. The chancellor is bringing forward a new financial services and markets bill as part of the Queen’s speech with the aim of “cutting red tape in the financial sector”. Under the changes, Sunak is planning to get rid of the EU regulatory regime covering the City of London and replace it with a UK-specific one. The Queen’s speech insisted that “high standards” in financial services regulation will be maintained but the move stoked fears that Sunak is looking to rip up rules governing the banks, insurers, traders and others in the City in order to boost the economy. Tory and leave donors have long been pushing for a move towards a lighter touch regulatory regime, sometimes referred to as the Singapore-on-Thames model. Sunak earlier this year said that Brexit would lead to a “big bang 2.0” in reference to the period of financial services deregulation in the 1980s, which was later blamed for paving the way to the financial crash of 2008. The description of the bill does not go into details about which elements of regulation will be scrapped or changed, but it does mention reform of rules around the UK’s capital markets “to promote investment”. This appears to take aim at MIFID II – tough regulations brought in by the EU after the 2008 crash to improve markets. The government claims that removing restrictions on trading in wholesale markets will benefit about 3,200 investment firms in the UK “who are currently prevented from getting the best price for investors”. Ministers are also looking at Solvency II regulation of the UK insurance sector, which could aim to release investment by reducing capital buffers and risk metrics for insurance and pension funds. The legislation is also designed to facilitate greater trading of cryptocurrencies, which regulators have warned must be tightly controlled to prevent people losing their savings. In a further deregulatory move, Sunak plans to update the objectives of the financial services regulators – the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority – to “ensure a greater focus on growth and international competitiveness”. Their aims at the moment are to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system as well as promoting competition in the interests of consumers – rather than the economy overall. Another element of the bill will be introducing additional protections for those investing in financial products to make it safer and support the victims of scams. Civil society groups warned that the legislation overall could “erode the ability of regulators to act in the public interest and catalyse a global ‘race to the bottom’ on social and environmental standards”. Fran Boait, executive director of Positive Money, a campaign group for a fair economy set up in the wake of the financial crisis, said: “Plans to force regulators to promote the ‘growth and international competitiveness’ of the City of London is at odds with such efforts to increase financial inclusion, as well as the government’s climate and ‘levelling up’ goals. “A focus on the growth and ‘competitiveness’ of the finance sector is what led us down the path to the 2008 financial crisis, and will mean regulators prioritising banks’ profits over the public’s access to financial services, as well as the wider health of the economy.” The move was welcomed by the financial services industry. UK Finance, the lobbying body for the industry, said it “provides the opportunity to tailor the UK’s regulatory framework and so create a more competitive financial services sector post-Brexit, supporting jobs and investment across the country”.",News/Business,Rishi Sunak to weaken City regulation in post-Brexit nod to Tory donors,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/10/rishi-sunak-city-regulation-financial-services-brexit-tory-donors
5/11/2022,"Discussions of gender identity and sexual preference are banned in many Florida classrooms because of governor Ron DeSantis’s “don’t say gay” law, alongside dozens of math textbooks blocked for “prohibited topics”. Now the Republican who has loudly condemned what he sees as the “indoctrination” of young people has made another subject compulsory: students must receive at least 45 minutes’ instruction every November about the “victims of communism”. In a ceremony Monday at Miami’s iconic Freedom Tower, where tens of thousands of Cuban immigrants fleeing Fidel Castro’s revolution were admitted into the US between 1962 and 1974, DeSantis signed into law House Bill 395, designating 7 November as Victims of Communism Day. Florida is one of a handful of states to adopt the designation, but is believed to be the first to mandate school instruction on that day. The instruction will begin in the 2023-2024 school year, DeSantis said, and will require teaching about Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong and Fidel Castro, as well as “poverty, starvation, migration, systemic lethal violence, and suppression of speech” endured under their leaderships in the Soviet Union, China and Cuba respectively. DeSantis, mispronouncing the name of the revolutionary leader Che Guevara as “Che Kay-Farra”, railed against students who wear T-shirts he said were oblivious about what communism represented. “You can see at a college campus students flying the hammer and sickle from the old Soviet Union flag, you will see students that will have T-shirts with Che Guevara, you will see students that will idolize people like Mao Zedong,” he said. “To me, this speaks of a tremendous ignorance about what those individuals represented and the evils that communism inflicted on people throughout the world. While it’s fashionable in some circles to whitewash the history of communism, Florida will stand for truth and remain as a beachhead for freedom.” Educators in Florida are banned, however, from teaching students about racial issues, including the history of slavery, if it makes them “feel uncomfortable”, according to DeSantis’s recently signed Stop Woke Act. DeSantis, seen as a frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, has waged a war on perceived “wokeness” and “transgender ideology” in Florida’s campuses and workplaces in recent months. He is feuding with Disney after the state’s largest private employer opposed the “don’t say gay” law that bans “inappropriate” classroom discussions of LGBTQ+ issues, and which is the subject of a legal challenge. The governor, who is seeking re-election in November, has signed a number of other bills popular with the Republican base, including a 15-week abortion ban and a “racist” redrawing of Florida’s congressional maps that critics say robs Black voters of representation. DeSantis’s detractors argue that the governor has focused on culture war issues while ignoring the real challenges facing the state’s residents, such as soaring rents that exacerbate racial inequality. “Why the hell can we not focus for even a moment on what’s impacting people everyday?” Brandon Wolf, press secretary of Equality Florida, said in a tweet. Jeanette Nunez, Florida’s lieutenant governor and the daughter of Cuban immigrants, hailed the move as a continuation of DeSantis’s efforts to remove critical race theory from classrooms, despite the fact it is not taught in them. “We will always ensure that our students are getting the best education free of socialist ideologies and CRT and woke terms that we will not allow,” she said.",News/US news,DeSantis signs bill for Florida students to learn about ‘victims of communism’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/10/florida-ron-desantis-communism-bill-students
