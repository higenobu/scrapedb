2/23/2022,"Good morning. If Russian forces try to take new territory in Ukraine, they will face an army that is far smaller and less well equipped than their own but hardened by eight years of fighting, writes Emma Graham-Harrison in Kyiv.  Nearly a decade of war has also left Ukraine with nearly half a million combat-experienced veterans, many now preparing to fight again, officially or unofficially. “The Russian army has better weapons and technical equipment than us, so we may lose battles or campaigns. But they can never win the country if the Ukrainian people are motivated,” said Serhiy Kryvonos, a retired special forces general and former deputy secretary of the national security and defence council. The likelihood of a larger war in the near future dramatically increased yesterday when Vladimir Putin said Russia would support the territorial claims of its proxy states in east Ukraine, in what Joe Biden denounced as an attempt to carve out “a big chunk” of the country. Is Russia invading Ukraine and what will happen next? Putin has sent soldiers on a “peacekeeping mission” but is likely to threaten Ukraine with a broader war. Here is an explainer on what could happen next. Is all hope for a diplomatic solution lost? Not necessarily. Putin said this morning: “Our country is always open for direct and honest dialogue, for the search for diplomatic solutions to the most complex problems.” However, he added Russia’s interests were “non-negotiable”. What is Biden doing to stop the crisis? The president has threatened tougher steps for further provocation, but some believe he is holding back in order to preserve the potency of sanctions as a deterrent. The Pentagon is expected to approve the deployment of 700 to 800 unarmed national guard troops to Washington DC, a US official said yesterday, in the face of trucker convoys that are planning protests against pandemic restrictions beginning next week. The District of Columbia government and the US Capitol police are requesting the national guard assistance. The troops would be used largely to help control traffic and were expected to come from the district’s national guard and three states, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss aid not yet formally approved. Modelled after recent trucker protests in Canada, separate truck convoys have been planned through online forums with names such as the People’s Convoy and the American Truckers Freedom Fund – all with different starting points, departure dates and routes. Some are scheduled to arrive in time for Joe Biden’s State of the Union address on 1 March, although others may arrive afterward. It remains to be seen if any of the US convoys would seek to actively shut down Washington’s streets, the way their Canadian counterparts did in Ottawa. Some convoy organisers have spoken of plans to briefly roll through the city, then focus on shutting down the Beltway, which encircles the capital. Donald Trump’s former attorney Rudy Giuliani is expected to cooperate with the House select committee investigating 6 January, and reveal his contacts with Republican members of Congress involved in the former president’s effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The move by Giuliani to appear before the panel – in a cooperation deal that could be agreed within weeks, according to two sources briefed on negotiations – could mark a breakthrough moment for the inquiry as it seeks to interview key members of Trump’s inner circle. Even though Trump’s allies and Republican members of Congress already known to have been involved in such efforts have refused to help the panel, Giuliani is now in a position to inform House investigators about any possible culpability. What could he reveal? The former president’s attorney is prepared to reveal his contacts and the roles played by Republican members of Congress to have then vice-president Mike Pence stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election victory. What else? He is also prepared to divulge details about Trump’s pressure campaign on Pence to adopt the scheme, and the effort to have legislatures certify slates of electors for Trump in states actually won by Biden. A North Carolina motorcyclist is suing Amazon for $100m after his collision with a delivery driver resulted in the amputation of his left leg, claiming the company’s pressure on its employees rendered the driver distracted and caused the crash. The lawsuit claims Amazon’s “Flex app” creates “foreseeable risk”. The three men convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery were found guilty of federal hate crimes yesterday, for violating Arbery’s civil rights and targeting him because he was Black. The jury reached its decision after several hours on the charges against Greg and Travis McMichael and William “Roddie” Bryan. Four people have died in the crash of a contractor’s helicopter on the Hawaii island of Kauai, the US navy said yesterday. The Pacific missile range facility said the aircraft crashed on the north side of the installation shortly after 10am. There were no survivors. The names of those killed were not yet available. Japanese women have outperformed men in medical school entrance exams for the first time since universities admitted they had deliberately failed female applicants to inflate the number of male doctors. The schools said they had deliberately failed female candidates due to concerns that women were more likely to quit their medical careers to start families. Wildfires that have devastated California, Australia and Siberia will become 50% more common by the end of the century, according to a report that warns of uncontrollable blazes ravaging previously unaffected parts of the planet. The escalating climate crisis and land-use change are driving a global increase in extreme wildfires, with a 14% increase predicted by 2030 and a 30% increase by 2050, according to a UN report involving more than 50 international researchers. Sex and sexual politics have long featured in David Mamet’s work. He has an immense, omnivorous oeuvre, from Hollywood hits to Broadway smashes as well as novels, children’s stories, essays, articles and cartoons, writes Arifa Akbar. His liberal-baiting plays have even caused punch-ups in the aisles and he hasn’t finished yet. As The Woods – his incendiary take on sexual politics – returns, the writer cuts loose, discussing how well Donald Trump did as president, as well as the art of writing and the death of free speech. Plugging methane from leaky oil and gas facilities would be free of cost almost everywhere in the world, and in many cases would produce a significant profit, at today’s soaring gas prices, the International Energy Agency has found, suggesting that governments have few excuses for not taking action to curb emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas. Last year, leaks from fossil fuel operations amounted to as much gas as Europe burns for power in a year. If that methane had been captured and used, the current gas crisis could have been largely avoided, the IEA said. A young bull that was swept into a surging river during flooding on New Zealand’s west coast has miraculously survived, turning up unharmed a week later, 80km (50 miles) downstream, snuffling about in a blackberry bush. The bull’s owner said he would have to get a special welcome home party – most likely a paddock full of grass. The pressure is also building to give his celebrity bull a name, but what exactly was “still under discussion”. First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

2/23/2022,"If Abbott elementary were a real school, the online reviews would probably be brutal. The students are unruly. The principal’s out to lunch. One teacher even kicked a kid. You can imagine childless neighbors complaining about their property values, former teachers ranting about why they quit and school parents cautioning other families to stay away. Of course, Abbott Elementary isn’t a real school. It merely depicts a fictional one on ABC, and in the mockumentary style. The workplace under the microscope in this sitcom is a West Philadelphia public school that’s typical of its subject. Which is to say it’s overcrowded, underfunded and underserving its community. It’s too true to the woeful state of public education in America to seem like it could be funny.  And yet it mines laughs, big ones, through its note-perfect imitations of life. After two years of Covid-related school closures, Zoom classes and critical race theory panic, it’s nice to be transported back to a simpler time when public schools were symbols of urban decay, and not the downfall of America. There’s a reason why teachers are the rarest television fodder; unlike doctors or lawyers or even journalists, their lives don’t appear to be especially cinematic. (Never mind the raft of headlines and cellphone videos that teachers attract for everything from breaking up hallway fights to entering into underaged affairs.) And when teachers are on screen, they mainly function as props for the angst-riddled teens or tweens really driving the story. (See NBC’s Saved By the Bell, HBO’s Euphoria, Netflix’s Sex Education, etc.) Glee and season four of The Wire are the rare shows that actually deem teachers worthy of genuine exploration. AP Bio, the NBCUniversal comedy that ran for four seasons, is a notable exception that foregrounds faculty – but even that sitcom is less a reflection on the seemingly impossible challenges of the job than one teacher’s unhinged fantasy of avenging the loss of a tenured professorship at Harvard. Even its fictional Whitlock high is a small-town, blue-sky idyll for the college-bound, majority white middle class. Abbott Elementary, though, keeps it real. It doesn’t shrink from urban public schools’ well-known occupational hazards – the metal detectors, the corroded infrastructure, the expired books, the broken families. (Not even West Philadelphia gets a Fresh Prince-like caricaturization.) Abbott’s comedy comes from teachers who are committed to solving these seemingly intractable problems, even when it would be easier – and smarter – to take the path of least resistance. None in the teachers lounge is more keen than, Janine Teagues, –whose dedication is driven by a desire to be remembered as that elementary school teacher we adults canonize long after the world turns us cynical. If that character sketch seems more grounded than “Harvard redundancy with an axe to grind”, it’s because Quinta Brunson – the A Black Lady Sketch Show alumna who stars on screen and as a writing executive producer – conceived of the ABC series in tribute to her mother, a near 40-year schoolteaching vet. And the show takes its name from Brunson’s actual sixth grade teacher, Joyce Abbott – still of West Philly’s Andrew Hamilton school. She even gets an onscreen avatar who is played to utmost primness by the Tony-nominated Sheryl Lee Ralph (of Moesha fame). As for the rest of Abbott’s core faculty, you’ve got the tough neighborhood broad (Lisa Ann Walter), the woke Teach for America type (Chris Perfetti), the blasé principal (the devastatingly charismatic Janelle James). And then there’s the substitute whose ambition and hotness keeps tongues wagging, played by Everybody Loves Chris’s Tyler James Williams, whose on-screen chemistry with Brunson dates to their Black Lady Romeo and Juliet spoof. Interestingly, Williams is inarguably the biggest name on the show. But for Abbott, the absence of celebrity actors is an asset, as it allows the story to be the star. And so far the story has resonated. After modest promotion and a launch in early December, ratings for the Abbott premiere quadrupled over the next 35 days, in an ABC first. Even more impressive: the series has avoided stigmatization as a Black show despite its overwhelmingly Black cast, a pitfall NBC’s excellent Grand Crew could not avoid. If anything, Abbott’s Black cast of teachers and students deepens its authenticity. In interviews, Brunson has spoken of her desire to create a show with heart. And there’s little doubt her success on that score has Abbott Elementary poised for a Ted Lasso-like breakout. But ultimately this show is a win for teachers, many of whom have contacted Brunson directly to say that, finally, they feel seen. It’s high praise; who knows if it’ll lead to any substantive reforms or even motivate viewers to shore up their public schools and advocate for those teachers. At the very least, Abbott offers a refresher on comedy’s golden rule: the truth is always funnier than fiction. Which is to say it’s not a school you want to skip.",Arts/Television & radio,Abbott Elementary sees teachers for who they are: big-hearted and underfunded,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/23/abbott-elementary-tv-show-teachers-schools-quinta-brunson
2/23/2022,"Around 1,300 workers at a Hershey’s candy manufacturing plant in Stuarts Draft, Virginia, are voting on whether to unionize, in a move organizers say is led by older workers seeking to ensure good benefits for newer employees. The ballots for the mail-in election to join the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers’ International Union will be sent to workers on 24 February, with results to be counted on 24 March.  The Hershey Company is publicly opposing the effort, encouraging workers to vote against it and hiring the union-busting Labor Relations Institute to hold captive audience meetings with workers. The LRI has also created an anti-union website ahead of the election and reportedly made ‘union-free’ lawn signs to distribute throughout the community. Workers at two of seven Hershey plants in the US are currently represented by unions. A worker at the Virginia plant, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, said the union organizing drive began around September 2021. The worker said employees suffer from a lack of respect and dignity on the job, grueling work schedules and conditions, and a two-tier system in which younger and newer workers are paid less than previous groups of employees. The union drive is being led by longtime workers nearing retirement, who are trying to ensure incoming workers are afforded the same pay, benefits, and working conditions they received when they began. “When you work seven days a week and you don’t know when you’re getting a day off, you’re just living so you can go to work,” said the worker. “We’re not the happy place to work that you would think a chocolate plant would be right now.” The worker described a strict disciplinary attendance system that reprimands workers for taking sick days they’ve accrued or for leaving during a shift due to a medical emergency. The company then requires mandatory counseling and drug testing if workers accrue too many absences. The worker also criticized practices that kept employees at lower pay scales by restricting access to training programs, and modifications that reduced workers’ eligibility for premium pay on weekends. “It’s a broken system on training, attendance, and then we have the administration simply not listening to people and their concerns,” said the worker. “They don’t care about us. They look at us as robots.” A spokesperson for Hershey responded to the unionization drive and working condition complaints by saying the company is “proud to have created a culture that empowers our team members to speak openly and directly with leadership and ultimately drive change within the organization.” They added: “While we respect our team members’ right to make an educated decision on whether they want to be represented by a third-party like a union, we believe the insertion of a union would be counterproductive and undermine the open and collaborative environment that has allowed the Stuarts Draft plant to thrive for nearly 40 years.” The worker at Hershey emphasized the fear of retaliation for union activity that they and other workers have faced throughout the union drive, while being forced to attend meetings held by anti-union consultants. “I walk in every day expecting to be fired. That’s something I’ve carried with me over the months,” added the worker. “I just feel a sense of violation of being forced into these meetings and listen to what I call propaganda. I never dreamed that I would experience something so negative in my life as being forced to go to these meetings.” The BCTGM union has criticized Hershey’s conduct throughout the organizing drive, including the timing of a longtime plant manager’s departure. Hershey says he left due to a planned retirement. “They’ve given the impression of surveillance with union activity and they went out and hired the very notorious union-busting law firm, consultants at the Labor Relations Institute,” said John Price, the director of organizing at the BCTGM International Union. “They are going around soliciting grievances from the workers with the implied promise that they can fix them without a union, and they coerce workers by superficially fixing some of these problems.” Price explained some workers have gotten the hired consultants from the LRI confused with the National Labor Relations Board, and that workers have been questioned about union activity that was conducted in a private Facebook group for workers interested in unionizing. He expressed intent to file several unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB. A second worker at Hershey, who also asked to remain anonymous, said that Hershey’s workers were motivated to unionize after their breaks were reduced and their overtime pay cut. “They think of us as machines that just work seven days a week,” said the worker. “They can invest more money to have more capacity so we don’t have to do that all the time. That’s the biggest issue for most people, they’d like to have a life and see their family.” The worker also criticized Hershey’s move to reward growing profits during the pandemic with t-shirts instead of higher pay. In 2020, Hershey reported a revenue of nearly $8.15bn, up from $7.99bn in 2019, and a profit of about $1.28bn in 2020 compared to $1.15bn in 2019. In 2021, Hershey saw a record year of production and over $1.47bn in profits. “That kind of stuff just really bothers people, to know that all that profit is generated by us and here’s a t-shirt,” added the worker. “I’d like more compensation for the profits we generate.”",News/US news,"More than 1,000 Hershey’s workers vote on plan to unionize Virginia plant",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/23/hersheys-union-vote-virginia
2/23/2022,"Aston Martin Lagonda reduced its losses in 2021 as it reported surging sales amid ongoing disruption to its supply chain and a slow start to deliveries of its new “hypercar”, but said it expected its finances to improve this year thanks to strong demand. The luxury carmaker, best known for making James Bond’s vehicles, reported a £76.5m operating loss for 2021, compared with a loss of almost £323m a year earlier.  Sales to dealers climbed by 82% during the year, after it was able to return to more normal operations following 2020’s Covid restrictions. The company began deliveries of its £2.5m Valkyrie hypercar in December, and shipped 10 vehicles to customers, however this was at a slower pace than originally expected. The company said in January the lower-than-anticipated number of Valkyrie deliveries would make it miss its annual profit target by £15m. Aston Martin expects to deliver between 75 and 90 Valkyrie vehicles in 2022, and said all of its Valkyrie coupes were sold out, with a waiting list. The carmarker delivered more than 3,000 of its DBX sports utility vehicle – targeted at wealthy female customers and on which the company is pinning its recovery – in 2021, accounting for half the vehicles sold through dealers. It is is aiming to increase the number of cars it produces by about 8% in 2022, to 6,600 vehicles, which it hopes will enable it to improve its adjusted profit by half. It plans to sell around 10,000 cars a year by 2024-25. The company said the return of the Aston Martin name to Formula One in 2021 had increased its “brand exposure, desirability and global awareness”. Aston Martin’s chief executive Tobias Moers said it was seeing demand from customers for all models. “Brand desirability is strong as evidenced by retails outpacing wholesales and the demand we see for our products, with the Aston Martin Valkyrie Spider, two-times oversubscribed following its launch in the summer,” he said. He added that the order book was filling up for its plug-in hybrid Valhalla supercar, which the company now expects to start delivering to customers in early 2024. The carmaker, which was saved from collapse in early 2020 in a £500m rescue deal by a consortium led by the Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, said it had faced “new and old challenges” in 2021 amid supply chain constraints and the pandemic. Stroll, the firm’s executive chair, said that when he invested he expected the company’s transformation to take “four to five years”. “We have made very strong progress already and are well on plan to achieve our ambitious goal,” Stroll said. Aston Martin’s shares, which have experienced a mostly downwards ride since its disastrous stock market flotation three years ago, rose by as much as 5% in early trade on Wednesday.",News/Business,Aston Martin optimistic after sales surge and slashed losses in 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/23/aston-martin-optimistic-after-sales-surge-and-slashed-losses-in-2021
