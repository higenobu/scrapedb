12/23/2021,"Trump said it was ""tough"" to criticize Biden because he complimented Operation Warp Speed. ""It is a little tough to be overly critical now, because he just thanked us for the vaccine and thanked me for what I did,"" Trump told Fox News. Biden on Tuesday praised ""the prior administration and our scientific community"" for fast-tracking a COVID-19 vaccine. Former President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that it's tough for him to criticize President Joe Biden after Biden complimented his administration's success in developing COVID-19 vaccines. ""Thanks to the prior administration and our scientific community, America is one of the first countries to get the vaccine,"" Biden said earlier Tuesday during a speech from the White House. ""Thanks to my administration, the hard work of Americans, we let, our roll-out, made America among the world leaders in getting shots in arms."" A few hours later, Trump told Fox News that he was ""very appreciative"" of Biden's acknowledgment and that it was difficult to criticize Biden in the wake of his remarks. ""It is a little tough to be overly critical now, because he just thanked us for the vaccine and thanked me for what I did,"" Trump said. ""You know, that's a first — so it is very tough for me to be overly critical now."" Trump also told Fox that he was ""surprised"" Biden praised his administration for fast-tracking the COVID-19 vaccine, adding, ""I think it was a terrific thing, and I think it makes a lot of people happy."" ""I think he did something very good,"" Trump said. ""You know, it has to be a process of healing in this country, and that will help a lot."" The former president has urged his supporters to get the COVID-19 and booster shots in recent weeks, though he's said he's opposed to vaccine mandates. ""This was going to ravage the country far beyond what it is right now. Take credit for it,"" Trump said last week while appearing on the former Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly's ""History Tour."" He later added: ""It's great. What we've done is historic. Don't let them take it away."" The former president drew cheers from the crowd when he said that he was opposed to vaccine mandates, adding, ""If you don't want to take it, you shouldn't be forced to take it. No mandates."" But the crowd began booing when Trump and O'Reilly revealed they were both vaccinated and had gotten booster shots. Trump attempted to throw cold water on the audience's negative reaction. ""Don't, don't, don't,"" he said. ""That's all right. It's a very tiny group up there."" Much of the US's pandemic response has been politicized, and the vaccines are no different. Republicans are far more skeptical of the vaccines and less likely to be vaccinated than Democrats. Many of Trump's most loyal supporters have for months spread deadly misinformation about the vaccines. While the Biden administration has pushed Americans to get one of the three available COVID-19 vaccines — which have proved effective at significantly reducing the likelihood of hospitalization and death from the virus — Trump has said that while the shots are safe, Americans should not be required to get them. The former president first encouraged Americans to get vaccinated in March, months after the vaccine was first developed and after he left office. The New York Times reported that both Trump and then-first lady Melania Trump privately received their vaccines in January, before he left office.

12/23/2021,"An Idaho sheriff is being charged for pulling out a gun on seven young girls between the ages of 12 to 16 in November. He is charged with assaulting their church group leader and publicly threatening to shoot her in the head in front of the girls in an encounter on a residential street in Blackfoot, Idaho. KTVB reports that on Dec. 14 the state’s Attorney General’s Office charged Sheriff Craig Rowland with aggravated battery, aggravated assault, and exhibition or use of a deadly weapon. In the state of Idaho, aggravated battery and aggravated assault are felonies, and the exhibition or use of a deadly weapon is a misdemeanor. A probable cause affidavit revealed that the girls were participating in a service activity and were giving out paper “thankful turkeys” notes to the community in the southeastern Idaho town. The girls would tape the notes to the door of a neighbor, ring the doorbell, and run away before the person could see who left the thoughtful note. Rowland was one of the neighbors to receive a “thankful turkey.” He told the investigators that around 8 p.m. on Nov. 9 he heard his dog barking and he went to see if anyone was at his door. He then saw two individuals running away from his door. The girls had tried to deliver him a note. A 10-page affidavit from the Blackfoot Police Department picks up the story from there. Police wrote that the girls were not able to deliver the secret note because Rowland had come to the door. They ran back to their group leader, who was waiting in her car. They were giggling as they shared their story and joined the other girls to continue to give out their paper turkeys. They went back to Rowland’s home and tried again to drop off the note. Rowland’s story to law enforcement is different. He recalls that a few minutes after he saw the people running from his home, he heard his doorbell go off and someone was fiddling with his door. That is when he got his gun and came outside in his winter undergarments, a pair of long johns and socks. By this time, the girls had gathered in their group leader Chelease Cox’s car and they were driving off. She noticed that Rowland was flagging them down, so she stopped. The girls thought that he was joking. She told him that the girls were trying to leave something for his wife. At this time, Cox reports, the sheriff looked into the window of the car and pulled out his gun. He pointed first at her, then at the two girls sitting in the front seat passenger side, and then back at her, saying, “get the f- -k out of the car.” As Cox put the car in park so she could comply with his request, he reached into the car, grabbed her by her hair, and dragged her from the car — in front of the girls who gave their blow-by-blow account to the investigators. It is at this point, Cox remembers, him aiming the gun inches away from her forehead. He then asked who she was and told her that he would shoot her. The chaperone tried to remind him that she was his longtime next-door neighbor and that she grew up in the house to the side of his home. She even said that she considered him a “family friend,” giving him her name. Her story did not move him, according to Cox. She told police, “That’s when I really got scared, because the gun was still at my head and he didn‘t know who I was.” Rowland didn’t recognize her and told the police when they arrived that he had no idea who she was. He did say that he could tell that she was terrorized and he told her to “get the f- -k out of here.” The affidavit also reveals that the sheriff did not deny his actions, telling them that he did pull her out of the car and pointed the gun at her head or neck. Rowland admitted to drinking earlier but told police, “I had all of my facilities with me, I was clear as a freakin bell.” This contradicts what he later told investigators about his adjustment to the time change. He told them that the time falling back actually really messed him up. He further admitted that he was agitated because he and his wife have had some unfavorable conflicts with the surrounding indigenous community. He said, “I have been doing this job for 36 years. I’ve had drunk Indians drive down my cul-de-sac. I’ve had drunk Indians come to my door. I live just off the reservation, we have a lot of reservation people around us who are not good people.” An official statement from the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes explains how offensive the sheriff’s statements regarding Native Americans were. It read in part, “The Shoshone-Bannock Tribes are disappointed in Bingham County Sheriff Craig Rowland’s comments that hit the news media on December 15, 2021. The incident did not directly involve tribal community members, although Rowland made racist comments about the Fort Hall Reservation.” It continued, “Members of the Fort Hall community disagree with Rowland’s statement including Chairman Devon Boyer, who states, ‘Rowland’s use of racial slurs about ‘Indians’ is extremely offensive.’ According to the Tribes Attorney, ‘Local law enforcement has a long history of violent criminal conduct towards tribal community members, stemming back decades. Race relations between local law enforcement has been controversial and sometimes violent.’ The Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, with over 6,000 tribal members, is not only the largest reservation in Idaho but in the southeast region. The statement reveals that the tribe does have power behind them, and is calling for his resignation. They are not the only ones calling for his resignation. The Associated Press reports that on Friday, Dec. 17, the Bingham County Prosecutor Paul Rogers and Blackfoot Mayor Marc Carroll called on Rowland to step away from his duties. Footage captured on Sheriff Rowland’s Ring doorbell camera gave investigators a more accurate picture of what transpired that day. In a step-by-step replay, it showed the girls taping the turkey to the door. It also shows them running away. It shows Rowland stepping out of his house, looking at the note, mouthing while he read the words “Thank you,” and then exclaiming, “That’s frickin’ bullsh–.” He is then heard calling to his wife to get his gun. As of publishing, Rowland has not entered his plea on the charges.

12/23/2021,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration on Wednesday extended a student loan moratorium that has allowed millions of Americans to put off debt payments during the pandemic. Under the action, payments on federal student loans will remain paused through May 1. Interest rates will remain at 0% during that period, and debt collection efforts will be suspended. Those measures have been in place since early in the pandemic, but were set to expire Jan. 31. President Joe Biden said financial recovery from the pandemic will take longer than job recovery, especially for those with student loans. “We know that millions of student loan borrowers are still coping with the impacts of the pandemic and need some more time before resuming payments,” he said in a statement. The omicron variant of COVID-19 that has swept through the U.S. with a fury has lent a new urgency to the question over whether the moratorium would be extended. Administration officials had initially said they expected the January extension to be the last. But even as the economy improves, there are concerns that borrowers are not ready to start payments again. Once the moratorium ends, those who were already behind on payments could have wages and benefits taken away as part of debt collection efforts. The policy applies to more than 36 million Americans who have student loans that are held by the federal government. Their collective debt totals more than $1.37 trillion, according to the latest Education Department data. About a third of borrowers are in default or delinquency and the average monthly payment is $400 a month. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a statement that the extension will allow for repayment plans responsive to the financial needs of the students, including an income-driven repayment plan. The continued pause “will provide critical relief to borrowers who continue to face financial hardships as a result of the pandemic, and will allow our administration to assess the impacts of omicron on student borrowers,"" Cardona said. The Trump administration initially suspended federal student loan payments in March 2020 and later extended it through January 2021. Biden has now moved to continue it twice, and the Education Department raised concerns about the effects of suddenly restarting payments, both for students and administratively within the department. The extension of the loan moratorium comes as decision whether to erase large swaths of student debt altogether is still on the table. Some Democrats are pushing for mass forgiveness of debt. But Biden has questioned whether he has the authority for that kind of mass cancellation, and legal scholars differ on that. Earlier this year, Biden asked the Education and Justice departments to study the issue. Officials have said that work is still underway. Biden has previously said he supports canceling up to $10,000 in student debt, but he has argued it should be done by Congress. Meanwhile, in October, the administration  relaxed the rules for the student loan forgiveness program it has in place already, ditching some of the toughest requirements around the program that was launched in 2007 to steer more college graduates into public service. Biden said that he was also asking all student loan borrowers to “do their part as well."" He said they should take full advantage of Education Department resources as they prepare for payments to resume, look at options to lower payments through income-based repayment plans, explore public service loan forgiveness, and make sure you are vaccinated and boosted  when eligible.”",U.S./Associated Press,Pause on student loan payments is extended through May 1,https://news.yahoo.com/pause-student-loan-payments-extended-171625750.html
12/23/2021,"JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israel Antiquities Authority announced Wednesday the discovery of remnants of two shipwrecks off the Mediterranean coast, replete with a sunken trove of hundreds Roman and medieval silver coins.  The finds made near the ancient city of Caesarea were dated to the Roman and Mamluk periods, around 1,700 and 600 years ago, archaeologists said. They include hundreds of Roman silver and bronze coins dating to the mid-third century, as well as more than 500 silver coins from the Middle Ages found amid the sediment.  They were found during an underwater survey conducted by the IAA's Marine Archaeology Unit in the past two months, said Jacob Sharvit, head of the unit. Among the other artifacts recovered from the site near the ancient city of Caesarea were figurines, bells, ceramics, and metal artifacts that once belonged to the ships, such as nails and a shattered iron anchor.  The IAA made its announcement just days ahead of Christmas, and underscored the discovery of a Roman gold ring, its green gemstone carved with the figure of a shepherd carrying a sheep on his shoulders.  Robert Cole, head of the authority's coin department, called the item “exceptional.” “On the gemstone is engraved an image of the ‘Good Shepherd,’ which is really one of the earliest symbols of Christianity,” he said. Sharvit said that the Roman ship is believed to have originally hailed from Italy, based on the style of some of the artifacts. He said it remained unclear whether any remnants of the wooden ships remained intact beneath the sands. ",World/Associated Press,Israeli archaeologists find treasures in ancient shipwrecks,https://news.yahoo.com/israeli-archaeologists-treasures-ancient-shipwrecks-151307554.html
