2/10/2022,"The UN’s food agency has warned that the “overexploitation” of fish in west Africa by the growing global fishmeal and fish oil industry is having a “considerably negative impact” on food security, undermining the ability of local communities to feed themselves. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report said that in Senegal, where three more huge fishmeal factories opened between 2015 and 2019, the industry was “likely increasing the risk” of overexploitation of sardinella and bonga, two pelagic fish on which communities depend.  In Uganda, where the factories rely mainly on fish species eaten by poorer communities, the industry competes directly with the “poorest consumers”, it said, making the price of fish unaffordable. The FAO has previously called for catches of sardinella species to be halved as a matter of urgency. Dr Aliou Ba, senior oceans campaigner at Greenpeace Africa, said: “We are heading for disaster and here is the proof. People here are facing rocketing food prices and devastating unemployment. “West African governments have created an economic model that benefits the wealthy in developing economies rather than our own people,” he said. “West African states should get rid of these destructive industries and take their responsibilities in order to preserve food security, jobs and the wellbeing of populations.” Last October, Greenpeace activists intercepted a 96-metre tanker in the Channel carrying fish oil from west Africa to Europe, to highlight the threat the industry poses to food security and to livelihoods in the region. The FAO report focused on nine countries, concluding that while the sector offered some economic opportunities, its “social benefits remain limited”. In Senegal, the gap between supply and demand for fish is forecast to hit 150,000 tonnes a year this decade, sending prices rocketing . The industry creates employment in the factories and mills. However, many of the jobs are insecure, temporary and do not always employ local people – in Mauritania, for example, employees in the industry were mostly from China and Senegal. In Senegal, fish oil and fish meal factories employed 129 permanent and 264 temporary staff in 2018 – compared with 600,000 workers in the artisanal fishing sector. Almost all the fish-derived ingredient (FDI) produced in Congo, the Gambia, Mauritania and Senegal is exported to China and Turkey, where the owners and investors in the west African factories and industrial fishing fleets mainly come from, the report found. Globally, 69% of fishmeal and 75% of fish oil is used to feed farmed fish such as salmon and trout.",News/Environment,"Fish oil and fishmeal industry harming food security in west Africa, warns UN",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/10/fish-oil-and-fishmeal-industry-harming-food-security-in-west-africa-warns-un
2/10/2022,"Josh Frydenberg’s attempts to cripple the proxy advisers who advise superannuation funds on how to vote on issues including executive pay have been described as a “cluster fiasco” after the senate killed off the regulations introduced by the treasurer. The regulations, which were introduced in December and had been in force for just three days when the senate disallowed them on Thursday.  The move was another blow for the government on a messy day in parliament where the government also shelved its contentious religious discrimination bills. The superannuation regulations required proxy advisers to hand the companies they have researched their reports on the same day as they have gone to paying clients. They also prohibited clients from owning proxy advisers. Critics said the rules robbed proxy advisers of their intellectual property and would have cost retirement savers money by forcing industry super funds, that have been a frequent target of Morrison government attacks, to set up their own individual research teams rather than use the services of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, where many are shareholders. The disallowance motion, which was proposed by independent Rex Patrick and Greens senator Nick McKim and supported by Labor, One Nation and Jacqui Lambie, formed part of a day of defeat for Frydenberg on financial services that also included the prudential regulator rejecting the government’s efforts to ban super funds paying fines from members’ funds. The regulations were introduced after Frydenberg failed to get similar legislation through – a process Labor frontbencher Andrew Leigh told parliament was an “underhanded attempt to undermine the proxy advisers”. Dean Paatsch, a co-founder of proxy adviser business Ownership Matters who has embarrassed the Morrison government through his work on jobkeeper payments, said the entire process had been a “cluster fiasco”. “It was profoundly disappointing that the government indulged crony capitalists and the major business lobbies at the expense of respect for property rights, the freedom to contract and the right to confidential advice”. Patrick said the regulations were “bad law, crafted to please Josh Frydenberg’s big business mates and political donors, and the senate rightly rejected it”. “This has got to be a world record start-up then shut down of a regulatory regime. It lasted three days. It was one big thought bubble from the treasurer that just wasted taxpayers’ money and the parliament’s time.” Leigh told parliament the defeat of the regulations, which included fines of up to $11m and jail terms of up to five years for operating without a licence, was “a victory for shareholder capitalism, for transparency, and for small business in Australia”. He told parliament it was also a “defeat for Arnold Bloch Leibler, the firm that pays the treasurer’s pro bono legal bills and has campaigned against the transparency that proxy advisers bring.” ABL partner Jeremy Leibler declined to comment. Acsi welcomed the senate’s decision to put the regulations to the sword. “The regulations were rushed through without parliamentary scrutiny and with no justification, rationale or harm identified,” a spokesperson said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Australian Institute of Company Directors, whose members regularly face scrutiny by proxy advisers over their pay and performance, said it was disappointed that the senate disallowed the regulation. Frydenberg said that “the Labor party has sided with the Greens again to roll back reforms designed to improve the accountability and transparency of the proxy advice and superannuation sectors”. Meanwhile, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority pushed back against efforts by Liberal backbenchers Andrew Bragg and Jason Falinski to stop industry super funds from paying fines out of members’ funds. A general ban on the practice was introduced in legislation passed in 2020 as part of the Morrison government’s response to the banking royal commission, but last year the courts said it was permissible for industry funds to levy members to build up a war chest to pay fines levied against trustees because their trustees have no reserves of their own. The backbenchers had promised to explore all possible methods of stopping funds using members’ money to pay fines, with Falinski calling the court decisions “a direct attack on parliament’s role in setting law in this nation”. However on Thursday Margaret Cole, an Apra executive board member told the House of Representatives economics committee that it was vital super funds be allowed to build up reserves. “To be clear as to the significance of this issue, without the ability to build and maintain a risk reserve an otherwise well run and well performing trustee could be rendered insolvent by a minor operational administrative error, such as submitting data one day late, resulting in a maximum penalty of $11,100,” she said. She said this “would be likely to be severely detrimental to members as it would probably impose material costs and create significant operational risks” and urged parliamentarians to move on from the issue.",News/Australia news,Senate dumps Josh Frydenberg’s superannuation changes in further government setback,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/senate-dumps-josh-frydenbergs-superannuation-changes-in-further-government-setback
2/10/2022,"Nathan Chen left no doubt, making good on his long-held promise to finally take hold of figure skating’s ultimate prize. The world’s most dominant skater over the past 47 months roared to the Olympic men’s title on Thursday, winning by more than 22 points after a mesmerizing long program that included five quadruple jumps and a pair of triples.  Chen, skating last after Tuesday’s record-breaking short programme, earned a standing ovation after completing a near-flawless routine an Elton John medley to finish with an overall score of 332.60, three off his world record and more than enough to hold off Japanese rivals Yuma Kagiyama, who won silver with a score of 310.05, and Shoma Uno, whose 293.00 was good for bronze. Moving across the ice with athleticism and pace in a Vera Wang-designed galaxy-print costume befitting of his ascent into the cosmos of the sport’s all-time greats, the 22-year-old from southern California by way of Salt Lake City captured the lone prize missing from his trophy cabinet and finally put to rest the demons of his catastrophic Olympic debut back in 2018. Four years ago, Chen arrived in Pyeongchang on a tailwind of hype as the joint-favorite with Japanese superstar Yuzuru Hanyu, but finished in fifth after dismal short programme where he tumbled to the ice on his opening quadruple lutz, failed to complete his required combination and was unable to land a single jump cleanly. He settled for fifth overall while Hanyu became first men’s skater to defend an Olympic gold in 66 years. Since then, Chen has dominated the circuit like few skaters in recent memory – topping the podium in three straight world championships, three head-to-head meetings with Hanyu and all but one of the 17 competitions he’s entered overall – while expanding his repertoire to push the sport’s outer technical limits. Chen has gently pushed back on the redemption narrative throughout the run-up to Beijing, preferring to frame his journey in terms of personal fulfillment. But the outcome stands regardless of the framing: Chen becomes the seventh American man to win Olympic gold in men’s figure skating and the first since 2010. One of the prestige fixtures of any Winter Olympics was billed for months as the climax of figure skating’s most compelling rivalry in a generation. In one corner: Chen, who has won all but one competition he has entered since the 2018 Olympics. In the other: Hanyu, the two-time defending Olympic gold medallist who inspires a near-religious fervour both in his native Japan and beyond. But Hanyu, who entered the Beijing Olympics under a cloud of uncertainty after missing the entire Grand Prix season due to an injury suffered in a November training fall, entered Thursday’s free skate in eighth place after his lowest short programme score in three years and needed something extraordinary to even get within touching distance of the podium. He didn’t wait long to attempt it on Thursday, attempting the quadruple axel on his opening attempt. But he underrotated the four-and-a-half-revolution jump and fell to the ice, then fell again moments later on his quad salchow. From there he showed impressive fight to finish with an overall combined score of 283.21 that remained in gold medal position until the final three skaters knocked him down to fourth.",Sport/Sport,Nathan Chen wins figure skating gold for US and Olympics redemption for himself,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/10/nathan-chen-wins-figure-skating-gold-for-us-and-olympics-redemption-for-himself
2/10/2022,"More than 400 sq miles (1,000 sq km) of Amazon rainforest has been felled to expand farms growing soya in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso in a 10-year period, despite an agreement to protect it, according to a new investigation.In 2006, the landmark Amazon soy moratorium was introduced banning the sale of soya grown on land deforested after 2008. From 2004 to 2012, the clearing of trees in the Amazon fell by 84%.But in recent years deforestation has climbed steeply, reaching a 15-year high last year – encouraged, campaigners say, by President Jair Bolsonaro’s anti-conservationist rhetoric and policies. With the moratorium applying only to soya, farmers have been able to sell the crop as deforestation-free, while still clearing land for cattle, maize or other commodities.  To map the deforestation, researchers from the Brazilian NGO Instituto Centro de Vida, along with Greenpeace’s Unearthed and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, looked at satellite data of land where soya was being grown in Mato Grosso state, which stretches across the southern part of the Amazon. The state grows more soya than anywhere else in Brazil. They found that while studies show the moratorium had successfully stopped rainforest being directly converted into soya fields, deforestation had continued. Farmers were clearing land to grow commodities other than soya, with 450 sq miles of rainforest – equivalent in size to Greater Manchester – felled in Mato Grosso between 2009 and 2019, according to the research.Holly Gibbs, professor of geography and environmental studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US, said: “At the same time that soy farmers comply with the moratorium, they continue to deforest illegally for other purposes.” The revelations undermine claims by supermarkets that soya is no longer linked to the loss of Amazon rainforest.Soya is a key commodity used by dairy, cattle, pig and poultry farmers in Europe and the rest of the world to feed their livestock. The Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (Abiove), the main association for soya traders in Brazil, said the moratorium had resulted in significant reductions in deforestation in municipalities that produce soya.“If soy beans are planted in polygons [an area between a specified set of coordinates] with deforestation after 2008, the entire farm is considered noncompliant with the soy moratorium,” Abiove said a statement.Previous analysis has suggested more than 1m tonnes of soya used by UK livestock farmers to produce chicken and other food in 2019 could have been linked to deforestation. Gibbs said pressure from soya buyers in Europe and the US was needed to stop the deforestation. “Legislation in the EU, UK and the US raises the stakes of this ongoing deforestation on soy properties. The soy industry could consider broadening the Amazon soy moratorium to close the door to all deforestation connected to soy.”Prof Raoni Rajão, an agricultural specialist at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, said the current regulations were insufficient. “Only the specific areas where soy is grown are monitored, not the entire property. Farmers have already noticed this loophole.” The Retail Soy Group, which represents leading retailers including Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Lidl and Waitrose, acknowledged there were limitations to the moratorium and said the new allegations “further highlight the need to have strengthened legal protections of these vital ecosystems”.Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the biggest farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

2/10/2022,"The low point for Matt Gammell, co-founder of Pickering’s Gin, came last spring when he got down to his last pallet of glass bottles. A longstanding order with a European glass maker was cancelled at short notice, and the Edinburgh-based spirit maker feared it might have to stop production.  After ringing around many different suppliers, Gammell managed to find enough bottles. He bought up the lot, exhausting most of the company’s dwindling cash reserves in the process. “It’s your brand DNA, it’s in a specific bottle, the label is designed to fit. You can’t just grab another bottle, it’s not how it works,” Gammell said. “It was exceptionally challenging.” Pickering’s Gin imports some of the glass bottles in which it sells some of its gins from China, and has suffered during Covid, paying elevated costs and dealing with unreliable shipments. Shipments from China that used to take on average 36 days have sometimes taken almost double that to arrive. The travails of Pickering’s Gin exemplify the difficulties faced by many smaller companies struggling to keep trading during Covid, buffeted by headwinds including product shortages, supply chain disruption, rising costs and lockdowns. And their struggles have shone a light on one critical link in supply chains that was at times stretched to breaking point: the shipping industry. Despite recent falls in cargo shipping prices, the world’s largest shipping companies have been reporting extraordinary rises in annual profits in recent months. Logistics analysts are forecasting that average shipping costs could reach levels never seen before, while disruption to international shipping will continue. For Pickering’s Gin, the price of bringing a shipping container from China soared from $2,500 – $3,000 (£1,845 – £2,213) prior to Covid, to hit a peak of about $18,000. The price has come down in recent weeks, but Gammell said it is hovering about $10,000, four times higher than the pre-pandemic cost. Businesses have been warning for some time of the impact of the surging cost of moving goods. MakeUK, which represents the manufacturing industry, and the British Chambers of Commerce, wrote last autumn to the UK’s competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), asking it to look into the world’s biggest shipping companies and whether soaring costs could be justified. The CMA told the groups it would monitor the situation, but informed them it was not able to address the price rises unilaterally, because shipping costs were “the product of multiple factors, often international in nature”. The complaint from the business groups came as shipping industry analysts forecast that the biggest global shipping firms would make extraordinary profits in 2021. Danish firm AP Moller-Maersk, the world’s largest container shipping company, reported on Wednesday that its 2021 pre-tax profits trebled to $24bn compared with a year earlier. Søren Skou, Maersk’s chief executive, said it had enjoyed “record-high growth and profitability” as a result of “exceptional market conditions”. However, the company said it had “spent tremendous efforts in mitigating bottlenecks” by increasing its capacity, and working to improve productivity. Maersk’s rival Hapag-Lloyd, a German container shipping line, also reported a huge profits increase in its 2021 results, with pre-tax profits reaching $12.8bn, almost $10bn more than a year earlier. The average cost of shipping a 40-ft container from Asia to northern Europe has remained elevated since last summer, and currently stands at $14,483, according to Freightos, an online marketplace that tracks freight shipping prices, which is about 10 times higher than 2019 levels. Cargo shipping prices had retreated since late September, when companies rushed to move goods ahead of Black Friday and the Christmas trading period, but have been on the rise again in recent weeks. Smaller businesses believe they are often the hardest hit by higher freight costs and shipping disruption. MakeUK warned prices are becoming unmanageable for some manufacturers. “While the pot may not be at the boiling point it has been over the last year, logistics costs remain a big part of the high cost temperature that businesses face,” said Verity Davidge, director of policy at MakeUK, adding it was difficult to predict when the costs and disruption would be resolved. At the time of its complaint to the CMA, the UK Chamber of Shipping said higher prices were caused by higher demand for goods, and said container lines had been responding with more capacity. Hapag-Lloyd said that its costs – including fuel, chartering vessels and storage – have risen tremendously. The company added that the shipping industry has not been able to cover its capital costs over the past 10 to 15 years. Pickering’s Gin produces several hundred thousand bottles of gin each year, but Gammell said that unlike larger companies, it does not have fixed price agreements in its supply chain.“We are at the bottom of the pecking order,” said Gammell. “We can’t commit to enormous volumes; we don’t have that buying power.” Even as container shipping companies reap the rewards of higher prices, disruption is set to continue. Delays to cargo shipments are likely to run well into 2022, according to logistics and supply chain analysts project44, amid China’s “zero-Covid” strategy, which has led to repeated port closures. The Covid lockdown in the Chinese province of Zhejiang in December sparked restrictions on the number of trucks allowed to enter the port of Ningbo – the third busiest in China – slowing port operations. As a result, the average shipping delay for vessels travelling from China to Europe jumped to six days in December, project44 found, in the face of high demand. Shipping companies are still being forced to cancel sailings, and vessels are stuck at congested ports in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the US, causing a ripple effect down supply chains, project44 said. Fluctuating costs and delivery schedules can make annual planning and forecasting extremely challenging for businesses. “We are making decisions on what to do this year. Having visibility on the future is really difficult,” said Laura Rudoe, the founder of an organic skincare company, Evolve Beauty. While the company tries to source its raw materials and packaging close to its Hertfordshire base, Rudoe said some parts – such as spray pump components for its bottles – are not produced in the UK or Europe. “We have to place the order now, and the shipping cost will happen in the summer,” Rudoe said, adding that packaging for Evolve’s Christmas range has be ordered months in advance. “It is really uncertain for us, we don’t know what to expect and it is hard to make a decision.”",News/Business,‘Exceptionally challenging’: how rising shipping costs hit UK firms,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/10/exceptionally-challenging-how-rising-shipping-costs-hit-uk-firms
2/10/2022,"Several US states, many of them governed by Democrats, began rolling back mask mandates this week, a move public health experts warn could set back progress battling Covid. On Wednesday, Massachusetts, Illinois, New York and Rhode Island joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey and Oregon in lifting mask mandates for some public places.  The wave of relaxations comes after months of private meetings among state leaders and political focus groups after the November elections, according to reports. “Now, it’s time to give people their lives back,” Sean Maloney, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, tweeted in support of New York suspending its indoor mask-or-vaccine mandate. Yet the lifting of rules has not been universally applauded and is coming at a time when the vast majority of the country (99%) is still seeing high transmission of the virus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Public polls show consistent support for mask mandates and other precautions, and experts say the time to relax precautions is not here yet – and acting prematurely could prolong this wave. “In my view, it’s too soon. I feel like we’re anticipating too much,” said Justin Lessler, a professor of epidemiology at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. “We’re being too confident that things are going to keep going the direction that they have been going.” The CDC’s director Rochelle Walensky also recently said that “now is not the moment” to drop masks in public, although the agency is reportedly weighing changes to its guidance on masks. While Covid cases have dropped from Omicron’s record-shattering peak, the US still has an average of more than 230,000 cases each day – similar to the height of last winter’s wave – and more than 2,300 people are dying from Covid each day, according to the CDC. While hospitalizations are beginning to fall, 80% of hospitals are still under “high or extreme stress”. Treatments, including antivirals and monoclonal antibodies, that keep Covid from progressing to serious illness and death are still in short supply throughout the country. Children under the age of 5 are not yet eligible for vaccines, while less than a quarter of kids ages five to 11 are fully vaccinated. “We have hundreds of thousands of people dying, we have millions who’ve been hospitalized and we have an unknown number who have long Covid and who will get long Covid as we roll back what little mitigation we have,” said Julia Raifman, assistant professor at Boston University School of Public Health and creator of the Covid-19 US state policy database. “Saying things are normal undercuts us in getting more people vaccinated and in helping people wear masks, because transmission actually remains quite high,” Raifman said. “The best way to help people think things are more normal is to reduce the amount of virus with the mitigation measures that we have.” The failure to set measures on when to drop or reinstate precautions “starts from the top”, including the CDC and the White House, Raifman said. “The whole of the pandemic response is being mismanaged, and only better leadership can help us come together to better address it.” Anthony Fauci, the president’s chief medical adviser, says the US is leaving the “full blown” phase of the pandemic. In September, he said controlling the pandemic meant having fewer than 10,000 cases a day. “This is not a declaration of victory as much as an acknowledgment that we can responsibly live with this thing,” said the New Jersey governor, Phil Murphy, who is also a key leader of the National Governors Association. Governors have reportedly urged Biden to “move away from the pandemic”. Many states – including Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Oregon, New Jersey and Rhode Island – are also set to lift school mask mandates. California is considering changes to the rules on school masks, while Illinois and New York will keep theirs for now. The governor of Pennsylvania lifted the school mask rule last month. Teachers’ unions have joined health experts in calling for science-based recommendations in order to keep educators and students safe, and to keep the virus from forcing further school closures caused by worker shortages. “I worry about taking off measures just because cases are trending down,” Lessler said. “At least some of the rate of decrease has to do with what little we’re doing to try to control transmission, and by stopping these measures – both directly and in the message it sends about the risk of the virus – you slow that down-trend.” A new variant could also emerge and change the situation yet again, he said. “We’ve time and time again been surprised by new variants.” Lifting measures too early and slowing the decrease in cases can result in “a lot of unnecessary cases and deaths that you might have avoided simply by waiting a few weeks”, Lessler said. “And if we change what we’re doing substantially, we may not get there, or it may take us longer to get there than anticipated.”",News/World news,Blue states are rolling back mask rules – but experts warn it’s too soon,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/us-mask-mandates-covid-omicron-democrats-cdc
2/10/2022,"Juan Carlos Marrufo Capozzi, an electrician and former soldier from Valencia, Venezuela, and his wife María Auxiliadora Delgado Tabosky, were at home when agents from the South American country’s military intelligence unit barged in. Soldiers with rifles sifted through their paperwork and hard drives, before taking the couple away, leaving Marrufo’s distraught teenage daughter from a previous marriage behind. That was in March 2019, and they haven’t tasted freedom since.  “They are completely innocent, they don’t even have any political affiliation,” said one of their family members on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. “Now they are trapped in an underground jail cell, and we don’t know when they will be free.” The couple was released in October and dropped off on a highway, only to be recaptured on the way home, and accused of terrorism and treason, amid a host of other offenses. News of their arrest appeared in the media, as often happens when people are detained on spurious charges in Venezuela. A report released on Thursday by Amnesty International found that politically motivated arrests were often preceded by stigmatization and smear campaigns launched by pro-government media in Venezuela. “Our research shows that there are instances where there is an extremely high correlation between public stigmatization and politically motivated arbitrary arrests,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, in a statement. “This correlation is a new indicator of a systematic policy of repression and points to the crime against humanity of persecution, which must be investigated by the international justice system.” For Marrufo and Delgado – who respectively also hold Italian and Spanish citizenship – the media attention was only part of the ordeal. “Their detention makes no sense, and they are in a very bad way psychologically,” said the family member, who has been in contact with the couple. “Juan Carlos is having suicidal thoughts because he’s been falsely accused of the worst crimes that there are. He needs help.” Hundreds of other people remain detained without trial in Venezuela, a country mired in social, political and economic ruin, and run by the authoritarian and isolated government of Nicolás Maduro. Venezuela boasts the world’s largest proven oil reserves, but runaway hyperinflation has rendered the local currency practically worthless, leading to the tacit dollarization of a so-called socialist country. Shortages in food, medicines and fuel are a daily reality. The UN working group on arbitrary detentions said in January that the couple’s detention was part of a “systemic practice of depriving people of their liberty without respect for the rights enshrined by international law”, and that such a practice “could constitute crimes against humanity”. Delgado’s brother, Osman Delgado Tabosky, was accused of financing an assault on the Fort Paramacay military base in August 2017, which was raided by soldiers loyal to the opposition for weapons. The Miami-based businessman was later accused of plotting a brazen assassination attempt on Maduro with explosive-laden drones in 2018 and labelled a terrorist by the government. Lawyers working on the couple’s case say their ordeal is the result of petty retribution from the regime. “It’s clear that there’s no guilt there, it’s just vengeance against María’s brother,” said Alfredo Romero, a lawyer with Foro Penal, a Venezuelan rights watchdog that is working on the couple’s case. “They are political prisoners, and of the 240 political prisoners currently in Venezuela, 91 have been detained for more than three years without even a trial.” In the face of growing discontent, the Maduro government has clamped down on enemies perceived and real, as he continues to resist a challenge to his legitimacy from the US-backed opposition leader Juan Guaidó. Mass protests in 2017 were met with brutal repression, with thousands of demonstrators injured and hundreds arrested. Arbitrary detentions and cases of torture abound, leading the international criminal court to announce an investigation into the government for possible crimes against humanity in November last year. “We can only hope that the investigation follows through to the end,” said Melania Leal Rosales, whose sister, Emirlendris Benítez Rosales, has been jailed since August 2018, also accused, without evidence, of being part of the plot to assassinate Maduro. “My sister is innocent and she can’t take much more.” Benítez, who was three weeks pregnant when arrested, lost her unborn child while jailed. She has also been beaten and tortured behind bars, according to the UN’s working group on arbitrary detention. She now struggles to walk and uses a wheelchair. “The papers said they found drugs in her car and some parts of the drones that were supposedly used to kill Maduro, and that she was trying to flee the country, but that’s all a lie,” her sister said. “They were looking for blame where there is none.” Meanwhile, the Maduro government’s tightening vice on society is causing some to lose faith in the ability of international mechanisms, such as the ICC investigation, to bring about justice. “People have been and gone before and the regime is still in power,” the family member of Marrufo and Delgado said. “It’s hard to keep the faith when reports get written but nothing ever changes.”",News/Global development,"Venezuelans despair at smears, stigmatization and arbitrary arrests",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/10/venezuela-amnesty-international-arbitrary-arrests-political
2/10/2022,"When Boris Johnson wrongly accused Keir Starmer of having failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile, many people reacted with a slight sense of bemusement. However, for those of us who research and monitor the far right, it was instantly recognisable. It wasn’t surprising that these comments were soon followed by the Labour leader being heckled by an angry mob repeating the conspiracy theory. Despite having been around since 2018, the disinformation about Starmer had recirculated in January this year, with major far-right figures such as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (AKA Tommy Robinson) sharing it with his 155,000 subscribers on the secure messaging service Telegram. The post whipped Lennon’s supporters into conniptions, with one simply posting the image of a noose in response.  There has been an increasing creep of far-right rhetoric and conspiracy theories into mainstream politics and it is important to understand how this occurs. It is unlikely that Johnson was scrolling through Tommy Robinson’s Telegram channel and came across the Savile slander. Rather, conspiracy theories and talking points circulate within far-right spaces, and the ones that gain the largest traction are spread incrementally via mainstream hosts such as rightwing commentators, until they are picked up by people who often have no idea where they originate. The best recent example of this has been some of Priti Patel’s rhetoric around cross-Channel migration. In early 2020, the organisation I work for, Hope not Hate, began to closely monitor a small group of far-right activists who spent their days on the beaches and at lookout points around the port of Dover. Their videos, which occasionally showed them chasing and harassing migrants on the beaches and at their accommodation, quickly spread across far-right social media platforms and whipped anti-immigrant activists into a peak of anger. The daily drip of anti-migrant content into far-right online spaces forced the issue of cross-Channel migration up the agenda within the movement. Started by solo far-right activists – so-called “migrant hunters” – the issue was soon adopted by more formal far-right organisations such as Britain First which began to enthusiastically campaign around the issue. Nigel Farage then joined in and began to discuss it on his LBC radio show. This was the moment the specific rhetoric around cross-Channel migration by boats escaped the confines of the far right and entered the mainstream once again, having dropped down the news agenda. Dehumanising talk about “floods” of migrants and alarmism about an “invasion” were once again amplified and subsequently picked up widely by rightwing traditional media outlets. The result was dangerous, with Patel, the home secretary, then echoing the language of the far right when she spoke of “activist lawyers” who she said were frustrating the removal of migrants. Sadly, some far-right conspiracy theories gain such traction that they become widely believed, most notably the “Muslim no- go zones” conspiracy theory. Hope not Hate polling, carried out by YouGov, found that 58% of Tory party members say it is true that there are “no-go zones” in Britain where sharia law dominates and non-Muslims cannot enter. Here we see an unsubstantiated belief, pushed by the far right and subsequently widely believed. Too often people think of the far right as a tumour on the body politic, something to be cut off an otherwise healthy host. In reality, it is better understood as a gangrenous limb that, if left untreated, poisons the rest of the body. Words have power. The cordon sanitaire that kept the far right “beyond the pale” is crumbling and the results are extremely dangerous.

2/10/2022,"When Michelle Dornelly is hoisting heavy crates of food into and out of her van, she thinks about her building. When her shoulders ache at night and she spots new bruises on her legs, she thinks about her building. She thinks about her building when she contemplates her living room, which is so full of tins that her children long ago stopped using it to watch TV, instead sitting in their bedrooms. Her building. A place where Dornelly could run the Hackney Community Food Hub, in east London, seven days a week. Where she could store the supplies she keeps in her living room. Where they could run workshops for families and take deliveries from their supermarket partners.  But they do not have a building. Instead, Dornelly and her team of 100 volunteers bounce around three different Hackney community centres, four days a week. On Mondays and Thursdays, the hub is in De Beauvoir Town; every other Tuesday it is in Homerton; and on Wednesdays it is at a different location in Homerton. Since it was launched in April 2020 in response to the pandemic, as part of the charity Children With Voices, the hub has supported more than 100,000 people, despite not having a permanent base. The building comes up in conversation almost every day at the hub, usually accompanied by sighs, as the volunteers help Dornelly pack up the van. They all worry about how much she takes on. Dornelly is strong, but she can feel her back starting to go. Her ribs are always bruised. Sometimes her fingers seize up into a claw-like shape. She can’t afford to pay private rent on a building: the organisation is a self‑funded food hub, not a large charity. She emailed a detailed proposal to Hackney council in October, asking for assistance in finding somewhere, but the council has not yet secured her a permanent location. She finds this infuriating, as the council refers people to Dornelly for emergency food. “There are so many empty buildings in Hackney,” Dornelly says. “Why can’t I get a building?” The council even gave Dornelly a civic award. Which was nice. But it is no building. Working at the hub is full-on at the best of times – and particularly hectic around Christmas. Dornelly became a community activist because she had to do something with all of her despair and frustration. It was consuming her. Her sons were getting attacked in the street. (She is a single parent to a daughter and three sons; all of her sons have additional needs.) The boys were continually harassed by the police. It all got so much that she had to get cognitive behavioural therapy. “I was the angry black mother,” she says. “Angry at the world.” She lives in London Fields, Hackney, an area with high rates of poverty and youth violence. According to a 2021 report from the thinktank Policy Exchange, Hackney has one of the highest rates of knife crime in London. Also, 12.1% of residents have no qualifications, compared with a London-wide average of 6.6%, according to the 2018 Office for National Statistics Annual Population Survey. A 2019 study from Loughborough University said 48.1% of children live in poverty, giving Hackney the third-highest level of child poverty of local authorities in the UK. So, in 2010, Dornelly founded the charity Children With Voices, which provides after-school and holiday clubs and mentors local children, with the aim of combating obesity, holiday hunger and gang violence. Initially, Dornelly funded it herself, using money from her benefits. She would walk around local shops, asking if they would donate food for the workshops. “I decided to be a proactive parent, because it was either that, or go mad,” she says. When the pandemic hit in March 2020, Dornelly pivoted to providing food to the “at-risk” families she had been supporting for years. She put out a call on social media for volunteers and more than 250 people responded. Some of them were middle-class professionals who had moved into the area – Hackney has rapidly gentrified in the past decade, causing house prices to rise to an average of £552,000, compared with a London-wide average of £467,000 – and were horrified by the hidden poverty in their community. “They lived around the corner and had no idea what was happening in London Fields and how bad it was,” says Dornelly. Many of the people the hub supports are on low incomes or benefits. “The support offered to someone who’s out of work has been falling as a share of earnings since 1960,” says Karl Handscomb, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, which says that the value of the main rate of unemployment benefit that a single person today can expect to receive is only 13% of average earnings. “What this means is that the level of support being offered is only just above what is considered the destitution line, meaning the bare minimum needed to get by,” says Handscomb. “But people may also be struggling to pay back debts or universal credit advances. That can take them below the destitution line and leave people struggling to decide whether to pay their bills or have food.” Dornelly relies on a team of 100 volunteers, including (top, from left) Ziggy Noonan, Ruth George, Tasha Paul and (bottom right) Brian Parker. Research from the Family Resources Survey found that 43% of people on universal credit are food insecure, meaning that they struggle to reliably put food on the table. According to the Food Foundation, 9% of all UK households are food insecure. It is estimated that 2.3 million children live in households that have experienced food insecurity in the past six months. Food bank usage has exploded in the past decade. In 2012-13, the Trussell Trust, the national food bank charity, supplied emergency food parcels to 350,000 people; in 2020, this figure was 2.5 million. Dornelly doesn’t have many good things to say about professional food banks. She is always keen to stress that she runs a food hub, not a food bank, meaning that she doesn’t require people to have referrals when accessing support: anyone can walk up. “We have loads of clients coming to us with horror stories about food banks,” she says. “For some, you have to get a referral, and you can only go there a maximum of three times, and they only give you tins.” Dornelly and her team of volunteers collect surplus food from local supermarkets, almost all of which would otherwise go to waste. “We say smell it, sniff it, taste it,” she says. “No one’s come back to us in two years to say that anyone got sick or died.” Dornelly’s family eat the same food as her clients: she receives universal credit. She could not afford to work and pay for childcare – plus, one of her sons is often in and out of hospital, due to his medical condition. She receives no salary for her community work, only occasional expenses towards her fuel costs. She says: “I’m experiencing the same situation everyone else is experiencing. I am still struggling myself.” She is by no means clear of her own financial worries – she is in arrears on her rent – although she doesn’t like to talk about it, because, relative to the community she serves, she says she is doing OK. And she is worried for them. The government’s furlough scheme ended in September. The temporary universal credit uplift of £20 a week was revoked the month after, which has been devastating for Britain’s poorest households. Handscomb says: “When the chancellor announced the uplift, he said it was to mitigate the temporary costs of the pandemic. But I would argue those costs haven’t gone away. Rising energy and fuel prices are a result of the pandemic. “We know that people on low incomes spend the biggest share of their income on heating and fuel bills.” He says existing government initiatives are inadequate. “The cold weather payment and warm home discount scheme are likely to provide only a few hundred pounds of support.” When the energy price cap goes up by 54% in April, the 22m households on default or variable rate tariffs will see their energy bills rise by £693 a year on average. The new price cap will put more than 25% of households into fuel poverty, according to the Resolution Foundation, meaning that they spend more than 10% of their income on energy bills after paying for housing costs. Research from the Food Foundation found that 55% of households with children fear that not being able to afford their energy or food bills will directly affect their children’s health and wellbeing. A rare moment of peace. “I know people who have five or six children at home,” Dornelly says. “Furlough has finished and their benefits have gone down. Gas prices have gone up. They have to heat the house because they have children. They’re asking me: do I heat the home or fill the children’s bellies and we go cold?” Yet, says Dr Rebecca O’Connell, an expert in the sociology of food and families at University College London (UCL), there are even worse predicaments. “It’s a cliche, isn’t it?” she says (UCL). “Having to choose between heating and eating. But some people aren’t even in that situation. They have neither heating, nor anything to eat.” It is the first week of November. Dornelly is at the De Beauvoir hub on a Monday morning. It is a cramped room, full of crates of food. On two trestle tables, volunteers sort out donations of meat, ready meals and packaged salads. Dornelly is beavering away in a corner of the room, allocating half the donations to be packed up and taken to the Tuesday hub in Homerton. Tuesday. Lizzie, a regular, arrives at the hub. She is in her 80s and walks there every week, even though volunteers would be happy to deliver her food and it takes her an hour each way. Walking helps her arthritis, she insists. Lizzie’s family do not know she comes to the food hub: she is too proud to tell them. Were it not for the hub, Lizzie wouldn’t be able to afford fresh fruit and vegetables. “A common strategy for people on very low incomes is to buy food that is filling, rather than nutritious,” says O’Connell. Public Health England publishes an Eatwell Guide, which outlines the optimal diet to meet basic nutritional standards. According to the Food Foundation, 27% of households would need to spend more than a quarter of their disposable income after housing costs to meet these dietary requirements. Many simply do not have the money to do so. Lizzie also picks up food for one of her neighbours, a man in his 80s who lives across the road from her. She used to split her food parcel with him, until Dornelly got wind of it and instructed her volunteers to make up a second parcel. Dornelly has a soft spot for Lizzie. She always stops to chat to her, no matter how busy she is. But although Dornelly doesn’t let the clients see her exhaustion, everything is starting to get on top of her. It is just relentless. “It’s starting to wear me out,” Dornelly says. One client has travelled all the way from Romford, Essex, with their child: they were rejected by their local food bank because they used it too often. Today, a volunteer is in tears because a client has confided in her that she has been going to bed hungry to feed her daughter. “Parental sacrifice comes up a lot in our research,” says O’Connell. “Most commonly, it is mothers who are heading up lone parent households and have had cuts to their benefits. They go without food so the children have enough. We also see older children sacrifice their food intake to protect their siblings.” Research from the Living Wage Foundation found that 37% of parents working full-time and earning less than what it terms the “real living wage” regularly skip meals for financial reasons. This food will be used to feed those in need, but Dornelly has occasionally been forced to refuse donations due to a lack of storage space. According to the Office for National Statistics, the poorest 10% of households spend just £34.40 a week on food and non-alcoholic drinks. Any unexpected costs – new school uniforms, benefits sanctions – can wipe out a food budget. This is without the increasing cost of food, being driven by Brexit and Covid-related issues in the supply chain. In January, grocery prices were 2.7% higher than a year ago, while wages remain stagnant for many people. “You often hear this idea that low-income families need to be taught to budget and cook. But, usually, low-income families have a really good idea of the cost of things,” says O’Connell. “When you have less to spend on food, you’re much more sensitive to those price rises.” The Homerton hub always serves a hot meal on a Wednesday. One regular arrives and eats seven bowls of soup in a row, to Dornelly’s alarm. “He’s starving,” she says. “What’s going on? What’s happening?” Mid-November. At 7pm on Saturday, Dornelly gets a text message from a mother of three: “Sorry to message you so late, but I’m just wondering if you know of any food hubs that are open.” Dornelly meets her the morning after and hands over a bag of food. A few days later, Dornelly gets a phone call from Claude, one of her volunteers. He regularly picks up food from a Marks & Spencer store in central London and drives it to the De Beauvoir hub. But he has just been given an £80 parking ticket. This is his third ticket. Dornelly decides that she can’t risk any more and informs M&S that she is no longer able to collect their leftover food. If the hub had a building, they could store items for longer, meaning they wouldn’t have to run about all the time, parking where they shouldn’t and racking up fines. All week, Dornelly is so frustrated that she keeps breaking down in tears. All she can think about is her building. The volunteers keep asking her about it. “My life is not my own,” she says. “I eat, breathe and sleep this. I’m out in the daytime working on it all day and I’m doing emails at night until 2am. I’m not getting paid for any of it. It’s too much to handle. I just want them to let us have a building.” Outside the De Beauvoir hub. First week of December. Demand is increasing. Dornelly is working 80-hour weeks, even though her volunteers try to minimise her workload by never emailing her out of hours. A pensioner comes to the Monday morning hub. He tells Dornelly that he is trying to live within his means, but he just can’t manage it. The pensioners really get to her. “The elderly fought in the war,” she says. “They gave their life for our country. And they’re sitting in their chairs with the little they have from their pension, thinking: do I eat or do I heat the house?” Dornelly doesn’t like it. She doesn’t like it when she is pressing packets of food upon grateful but ashamed elderly people. She doesn’t like it when she drives past homeless people on the streets on her way home. She doesn’t like it when she sees expensive blocks of flats popping up all over the borough, developments that will push up rents and drive locals out of the community. She doesn’t like any of it. “There is no need for it,” Dornelly says. She is standing outside the hub, shivering in the cold. “The way the government is treating people.” She almost spits out the words. “One of the solutions to food poverty is to ensure that wages and benefits are adequate to allow families to buy food that meets their needs for health, but also for social participation,” says O’Connell at UCL. “Food is how we live and participate in society. Being excluded from that is very painful.” She has carried out research in other inner-London areas with similar demographics to Hackney. Children would talk to her about the experience of never being able to go to Costa for a hot drink and a slice of cake, like their friends, because that might be half of the family food budget. “When children are surrounded by expensive eateries and coffee shops that some of their peers can go to, but they cannot, that is really excluding,” she says. A woman calls Dornelly on Thursday evening, after the Homerton hub closes. Dornelly takes a bag of food and meets her in Dalston. When the woman arrives, she is faint with hunger. She is in her 60s, a pensioner. She asks if it is OK to give out some leaflets for the food hub to other people who are struggling. Dornelly presses them upon her. Mid-December. There are issues at the Wednesday hub in Homerton. The building is open to the public and people attending events keep helping themselves to food from the food hub’s fridge. Dornelly remonstrates with one of the people who manage the building, but the man is dismissive; he tells her that if someone ate her food, it must have been because they were hungry. The man pulls out some money and tries to thrust it upon her. Dornelly refuses to take the money, telling him that it is about the principle. She wants people to respect what she is doing. She says that the man throws the money into her fridge instead. Dornelly goes outside to get away from him. She is hyperventilating. A teenager walking past asks her if she is OK. “I felt so bad,” she says. “I felt so low.” She is sick of lugging the crates between community centres, getting bruised and wrecking her back, only for people to help themselves to the food she sets aside for people in need. “I’m just getting tired,” she says. “I don’t know how much I can continue to go on. Because it’s getting a lot.” Dornelly and her team will deliver to anyone unable to visit the hub. Christmas week. The man has texted Dornelly to apologise. She plans to avoid that hub this week all the same. She can’t face seeing him. On Monday, one of Dornelly’s volunteers, Ziggy Noonan, sends her a voice note. She has just had a phone call from a distressed mother with a daughter of 12, with no money for food. The headteacher of her daughter’s school gave her the food hub’s number. “Honestly, Michelle, she was sobbing,” says Noonan. “I said: ‘It’s OK, it’s going to be all right, we’re going to support you here.’ I got a bit emotional myself.” At the Tuesday hub, Christmas music plays. Noonan is dressed up as Santa. Dornelly’s 22-year-old daughter, Renisha, is wrapping presents on a trestle table in the open air. Every child arriving at the hub today will receive an age-appropriate gift. For some, it may be the only gift they receive. Dornelly is in a Santa dress, accessorised with her signature slash of purple lipstick. She is in frantic form, darting from volunteer to volunteer and coordinating drop-offs from local businesses and well-wishers. She stops to chat to a stressed-out mother whose benefits are about to be sanctioned because she doesn’t have the laptop she needs to complete her online learning. “It’s horrible,” Dornelly sighs. Barry, one of her regular volunteers, comes in to pick up a parcel for a woman in her 80s. Her husband died recently and she is struggling. “They call me black Jesus,” Barry chuckles to the volunteers as he bags up the food. The council dropped off a carrier bag earlier, containing a few toys and some biscuits. “There’s nothing to it,” says Dornelly, dismissively. The council has previously supplied the hub with bulk food orders, while Dornelly has received some funding and assistance with querying parking tickets. But relations between the council and the food hub are strained at best. To add insult to injury, last night she got another referral from a council worker, directing her towards someone who needed emergency food. In response, the mayor of Hackney, Philip Glanville, told the Guardian: “Children With Voices is part of the Hackney Food Network, a partnership of over 60 community organisations in the borough providing food solidarity to residents through community food hubs, co-ops and food banks, and I am very grateful to all the organisations in our network for the work they continue to do in supporting our residents. “The council seeks to work closely with all of the community partners in our network, and has specifically supported Children With Voices with bulk food orders and in connecting it with the commercial property team for a suitable vacant property. A number of sites have been discussed, but a suitable property has not been found yet.” Boxing Day. Dornelly drops off a food parcel to a homeless man in his 50s, whom the hub has been supporting on and off for two years. The council keeps moving him from hostel to hostel. “He was very grateful we hadn’t forgotten about him,” she says. First week of January. Dornelly gets an exciting email: someone is trying to convert a Clapton church into a community centre and asks if she would like to come and have a look. Dornelly heads down, but the space isn’t big enough for the food hub. She is about to close up the Thursday hub when a 94-year-old woman comes in, accompanied by a friend. The woman had a fall a few weeks ago and, because she lives on a quiet road, she was left out on the street, in freezing weather, for nearly three hours. Her friend, who looks out for her, heard about the food hub and brought her to it. Dornelly tells the woman her volunteers can drop off food to her front door and keep an eye on her. “I’m still coming to terms with it now,” she says. “Imagine that poor lady being left on the ground for three hours. It’s diabolical. People like that should be monitored.” The work is physically demanding, leaving Dornelly with bruises and back pain. Second week of January. After an unseasonably warm end to the year, a cold snap arrives. At the De Beauvoir hub on Monday, clients are complaining about the cost of gas. Inflation has reached 5.4%, its highest level in 30 years. “This is the steepest rise in the cost of living we’ve experienced since the 1990s,” says Handscomb. “If the government wants to protect the incomes of low- to middle-income households, it has to do something.” In response to the growing cost-of-living crisis, and the news that the energy price cap is to rise by more than 50% in April, the government last week announced a one-off energy bill rebate of £200 in October, although this amount will have to be repaid in £40 increments over the next five years. Council taxpayers in bands A to D in England will also receive a £150 rebate that will not have to be repaid. The government will also increase the number of homes eligible for the warm homes discount. Around Dornelly, her team is working conscientiously, bagging up individual portions of fruit and vegetables – someone has donated a gleaming box of pastel-pink rhubarb – and sorting through packets of meat. Salads and sandwiches are stacked on a trestle table; Dornelly presses her team to have some for lunch. She mothers all of them, constantly checking to see that they have had something to eat, calling everyone “darling” or “sweetheart”, regardless of their age. A volunteer makes Dornelly a cup of tea, but she gets distracted and it goes cold. (This is typical of her; Dornelly always has to reheat her hot drinks in the microwave.) Demand is intensifying. The team signs up three new clients for deliveries in one day: one young person who is vulnerable, two pensioners who live alone. But despite this increase in need, Dornelly is having to turn away food. M&S emails to offer another collection, but Dornelly wouldn’t have anywhere to keep it. “Thank you for the opportunity,” she responds, “but until we can get a bigger building I will have to say no thank you this time.” It is painful, having to turn down food. Come Thursday, Dornelly is meant to be having a day off when she checks her Instagram. “I’m in dire need of help to get through until Wednesday for my two-year-old, partner, and me,” a woman writes. Dornelly invites her down to the Thursday hub, but she doesn’t have any money for the bus fare. “I don’t have any money to my name at all,” the woman writes. A volunteer drives to the woman’s house and drops off some food. Later the same day, another client messages Noonan. She forwards it to the hub’s WhatsApp group. “I tested positive for Covid and I have nothing, even my bread is green,” the client writes. “Is there anything you can help with by getting some food bits here? If not, no worries, thanks for the help always.” Another volunteer, another drop-off. Mid-January. More issues at the Homerton hub. Dornelly has been allocated a fridge, but it is overflowing with food – her volunteers have to tape it shut. There is a second fridge, but she says she has been told that she is not allowed to use it. Now, when Dornelly goes in there, she feels there is a horrible atmosphere. She feels as if she is being monitored by the people who manage the building. She says they find excuses to come into the hub and hover, watching her team. Dornelly has been feeling unwell all week. The stress of the situation causes her to break down in tears. “This is making me sick,” she says, choking back sobs. “I’m getting weak and emotional about it. It’s not making me better. It’s just getting really awkward and complicated. I don’t know what they want from me. I’m bringing in food to serve their community. If I bring in less food, less people will get fed.” Late January. Late Monday evening, she is at home when one of her volunteers knocks on her door and unexpectedly unloads a crate of M&S food. Dornelly takes it, even though she doesn’t have anywhere to store it, because the hub isn’t open tomorrow. She drops most of it off at a local homeless hostel and makes up a bag to take to Lizzie. When she gets there, Lizzie is upset. She has been looking after a neighbour, a man in his 80s, who lives alone. He just got out of hospital. Lizzie always brings him food from the hub. When she got there earlier, she found him sitting in the dark. There was no gas or electricity. It was cold. He didn’t have a bed. Lizzie contacted the council and someone went around and switched his gas and electricity back on, but he is still in dire need. Tomorrow, Dornelly will arrange for a food parcel to be dropped off at his house. She will try to find him a bed, a mattress and a warm quilt. She will make sure that her volunteers go around there regularly, to provide him food. She will check on him herself. “I don’t like to see how he’s going to be living in that house on his own when it’s so cold,” says Dornelly. Sometimes it feels as if everything is disintegrating around her. There is so much need, everywhere she looks, in this city. The institutions that should be helping don’t seem to do anything. What would happen, Dornelly wonders, if she just stopped? Who would look after all these people – and all the other people they don’t even know about yet? But there is no time to think. There are crates to be stacked and loaded into the back of the van. Drop-offs to be coordinated. Street corners to wait on, to press food into the hands of hungry, desperate people. Pensioners to visit and donations to sift through. Dornelly’s body may be bruised and exhausted, but she plans to keep on going, for as long as she can.

2/10/2022,"Nacreous clouds, also known as “mother-of-pearl clouds” or “polar stratospheric clouds”, are a rare type of cloud best known for their vivid and sometimes luminous colours. Almost all clouds form in the troposphere, which typically extends 10-15km (6-9 miles) in altitude. However, nacreous clouds form higher up in the atmosphere, between 15 and 25km, in the lower part of the stratosphere, the layer of atmosphere above the troposphere in which we live. The stratosphere is very dry, so very cold conditions are needed to form the ice crystals that are needed to develop nacreous clouds. The clouds require temperatures lower than -78C. Temperatures as low as this are generally only found in the stratosphere during polar winter, and nacreous clouds can form only in lower-than-average stratospheric temperatures. As a result, nacreous clouds are generally visible only at high latitudes and rarely observed in the UK.  However, if conditions are favourable, the best time to try to observe nacreous clouds is shortly after sunset or shortly before dawn in a period known as “nautical twilight”. When the sun is just a few degrees below the horizon, it can result in beautiful and colourful clouds as a result of interference of light waves through the Earth’s atmosphere.

2/10/2022,"Ifound myself, during our strange, second Covid Christmas, sandwiched between my 22-year-old daughter and my 89-year-old mother. This year, more than ever, the umbilical connection between us tugged at me as I, Janus-in-waiting, observed, monitored and enjoyed the miraculous luxury of three generations together. My daughter has tattoos. I like them, which surprises me. I understand the urge to mark life’s more seismic events upon your body. They sear themselves into our brains after all, so perhaps tattoos are just the outer version of the inner burns.  My mother’s body bears witness in more traditional ways – watching her navigate its frailty and bentness is a daily learning, a meditation. She taught me to walk when I was a baby, and now, she teaches me how I will walk when I am old: how to reach for this, bend for that, move around the obstacles like an ancient, patient stream. I try not to help. Living between these bodies is an odd mixture of joy and grief. My daughter thrums. Her life force changes the atmosphere in the room as soon as she enters. We all receive the electrical charge and, once again, we dance. I must have done that once. Or my daughter comes in upset, chaotic, spinning out and sits by my mother and receives a calming nod – no questions, I note – and the chaos subsides. Whatever made us think we could live without this? We were stuck on our goals and our aspirations and – God forbid – our dreams. We were too busy to notice how the bodies silently speak to one another, how we breathe each other in, recalibrate and breathe out. But the meeting of these life forces now feels more essential than ever. We are constantly exchanging ever-altering resonances, and balance occurs. Not perfectly – nothing’s perfect – but, consistently, we change and reset one another’s state. So instead of grieving my mother’s ageing, instead of envying my daughter’s youth, I find I am buoyed up and calmed down by turn. “Why is my fanny getting bigger?” my mother breathes at me one morning as she is washing the forks. We laugh for quite a long time. Her skin reminds me of my daughter’s when she was a baby: the same almost-not-there softness, lovely to stroke. It feels like she’s returning to something. When I hold my daughter, I can feel, in deeply recessed parts of my body, her vulnerability. She’s all fire and sparks, but I know it’s there. I try not to help. She’s brimful of the world, and the image in my mind’s eye is of her walking away towards the sun carrying a rucksack, my mother sitting by the fire, dozing to the crackle, and me, standing in the doorway, held between the two states of departure. One towards action and one into stillness. It’s a rich position to be in, full of nutrients, somehow. I exist between them. I’m grateful I can still get up a hill and I’m depressed about my thighs.

2/10/2022,"In 25 years of presenting documentaries, I’ve made it something of a specialty to go to places and listen to people whose views represent something troubling, even dangerous. The first segment I ever made on TV, for Michael Moore’s TV Nation, was about millennial cults and involved a trip to western Montana, where I spoke to two neo-Nazis in a trailer. For several hours, they explained how some time in the not-too-distant future there would be global racial conflict, leading to Jesus Christ returning and banishing the different races to separate planets in some cosmic version of old-school southern segregationist policies. Late in the evening, when it had grown dark outside, they made me a cup of tea, which I appreciated. They seemed a little warmer towards me and I asked whether, after the inevitable race war, I might be able to make occasional visits to the black people’s planets, but it was still a non-starter. In the years since, I’ve made many more hours of documentaries on a variety of subjects, some of them focused on more innocent kinds of cultural oddity, such as infomercial gurus or swingers’ parties; others on more serious social themes of crime and mental health. But there has always been a strand in my work of being curious about the side of life deemed – in that rather woolly pejorative buzzword – “problematic”.  On Sunday, have a new series going out on BBC Two. Louis Theroux’s Forbidden America is squarely in the sweet spot of problematic content. White nationalists, trigger-happy rappers and figures in the porn world accused of sexual misconduct – they all make appearances. In one sense, in the context of my output, it is business as usual – my latest stop-off in a journey that started all those years ago with neo-Nazis in Montana. But in another sense, in releasing this series now, I am aware that it is business as unusual. Times have changed. The world is different; the pandemic, social media, the killing of George Floyd and the ensuing conversations about institutional prejudice and Black Lives Matter. In the context of everything that’s happened in the last couple of years, the decision to put out a series chockful of troubling individuals giving expression to upsetting and extreme opinions might seem odd. The term is “platforming”: the idea that it is irresponsible to amplify hateful voices and that in doing so one is contributing to their power and their harm. We should instead ignore the toxic and the dangerously misinformed, the argument goes: exclude them from the conversation. At its simplest, this is a view so uncontroversial as to be almost banal. Quite clearly, we don’t want card-carrying neo-Nazis hosting daytime quiz formats or giving talks to children at our local schools. There is no obligation for us to hear paedophile apologists or Isis sympathisers on Radio 4’s A Point of View. Nor to give air time to flat-earthers or climate crisis deniers on current affairs shows. This has been the case for as long as the media have existed: broadcasters have always had an obligation to think about ways in which they reflect opinions that may be misinformed or hateful. Making it even more pressing nowadays is the demonstrable harm caused by the spread of false information online and the way this has empowered formerly marginal figures such as conspiracy theorists and nativists. The world we were delivered by Mark Zuckerberg, instead of the promised one in which we would connect with friends via Facebook and share pictures of banana bread, has curdled into a more troubling place where trolls, anti-vaxxers, ethnonationalists and conspiracy loons can pipe their nonsense directly on to our laptops and phones. Dodgy algorithms have weaponised our anger and fear, enticing us into liking and sharing content that is false and divisive. And in a manner reminiscent of the fast-food industry, and its reliance on high-fat, high-sugar content, we appear powerless to resist the spread of junk information about lizard overlords, Pizzagate, and what Phoebe Cates looks like now and how it will leave you speechless (answer: she looks fine). In this new landscape, every day seems to bring a new test case of whether some influencer or high-profile person should be deplatformed, or whether tech companies and media outlets are throttling free expression by deciding what we can and can’t see and hear. Donald Trump fomented unrest on Twitter and was kicked off. The comedian Dave Chappelle sparked boycotts and a campaign by trans rights activists for jokes on a comedy special on Netflix. As I write, the papers are reporting a growing groundswell against Spotify for its deal with the US podcast host Joe Rogan. Musical artists Neil Young and Joni Mitchell have taken their music off the streaming platform, saying they don’t wish to be part of a service that – in their view – contributes to vaccine misinformation. These aren’t always easy situations to figure out and each of them needs careful thought. The bigger point, though, is that I do understand how, viewed in this context, my decision to put some potentially dangerous and inflammatory figures on BBC Two primetime might appear flat-out weird and irresponsible. And to be clear, some of the people who feature in the documentaries are several orders of magnitude beyond Rogan and Chappelle on the “cancelometer”. Extreme and Online, the first episode of Forbidden America, is about a community of trolls and white nationalists whose mascot and leader, the diminutive streamer and broadcaster Nick Fuentes, tells me at one point it would be better if women didn’t have the vote. He says he views homosexuality as “disgusting”. He has also made Holocaust-denying remarks in his online broadcasts. He was outside the Capitol on 6 January and is on record as praising the events of the day, viewing them as a blow for freedom and justice. Other interviewees in the show are cut from similar cloth. A far-right hipster-influencer who calls himself Beardson Beardly, and has appeared online in images doing what many believe to be Nazi salutes (though he denies this), gets some airtime – before he throws me out of his house for asking him about the salutes. Another person I speak to is a troll and livestreamer who uses the pseudonym Baked Alaska (his real name is Anthime Gionet), who has posted inflammatory racist content online – getting himself kicked off Twitter– and was inside the US Capitol building on 6 January, livestreaming his own act of alleged trespass and soliciting several thousand dollars’ worth of donations as he did so. So no – they wouldn’t be your first choices to fill in for Sue Perkins and Gyles Brandreth on Just a Minute. And yet I believe I was right to make a programme about them. There are several reasons why. The most obvious one is the nature of the project. I make immersive documentaries, researching, shooting and editing over the course of months or even years. It is very far from the “here’s your mic, have at it” atmosphere of a conventional debate or TV appearance. Over the years I have made programmes in prisons, among confessed murderers and paedophiles, and in maximum security hospitals for paedophiles. These troubled, sometimes dangerous people are legitimate subjects of journalistic inquiry. You wouldn’t have them sitting in as pundits on The Moral Maze but in the right context, with the right approach, speaking to people who have done terrible things can be a totally valid exercise: revealing and ultimately life-affirming, shining a light on aspects of human psychology and society in a way that promotes understanding and cultivates empathy. You might argue that an inmate or convicted predator is a different case from someone actively promoting a divisive political position. And there’s something in that. But – without wishing to sound too much like Liam Neeson – I have a specific set of skills that means I believe I can be trusted to tell these stories in a responsible way. By being informed, by doing the research, by spending time in the field – for hours or days or weeks even – questioning, challenging and revealing the reality of the people we are reporting on, and doing responsible journalism. “But why do we need to hear from these people?” you may ask. Well, you might not need to. But the reason you might choose to is because of what their existence says about the world we are living in, and because of the very real power they represent. The truth is, in terms of his online following, Nick Fuentes and his ilk already have platforms from which they can and do reach audiences, in bedrooms and living rooms around the world, in the millions. And just as Trump has shown no sign of disappearing – notwithstanding his cancellation from virtually every social media outlet going – the reach of Fuentes and his supporters is not likely to end soon. So the choice we are faced with is whether to be curious about that phenomenon, try to figure out why it’s growing, what it’s feeding on, how it can be challenged, or whether to ignore it and hope it goes away. Incidentally, so far, I’ve only written about the first episode, Extreme and Online. In other episodes we meet rappers in Florida who appear to enjoy stoking beefs that have cost lives and getting tattoos on their eyelids that say “Fuck you”; and we interview the porn agent Derek Hay, who has been accused by some former models of sexual misconduct but who has denied any wrongdoing. Part of the job of telling these stories has been working hard to reveal the layers underneath. Over the more than two years we’ve spent making it, enormous effort has gone into giving the programme the necessary shape and context to ensure that questionable views are interrogated, conveying to viewers the whole story and not just those parts the interview subjects wish to show. One positive side-effect of the new media landscape is that it’s harder for people to hide their real views. In having their own platforms, the participants in these worlds have not only acquired new influence, they have also created vast digital catalogues freely available online and filled with candid expressions of their sincere opinions, for all of which they can be held accountable. This brought an enjoyable transparency to the filming and a sometimes edgy and even hostile energy: the sense of it being a showdown between a legacy media emissary and an insurgent force of disrupters. In several meetings with the far right, they had their own cameras trained on me. Baked Alaska implied he might be making a documentary about me. On several occasions, the far-right influencers did broadcasts about me when I wasn’t around, making clear their real feelings, including one in which Nick Fuentes described me as “pretentious” (moi!?) and ridiculed what he took to be my view of him as a hatemonger, characterising it as either dishonest or – in his word – “retarded”. But the bigger point is that, for all their intricacy and ironical pirouetting around the subject of their real beliefs, their digital footprints meant I had the advantage of being informed as to who I was really dealing with. I understand why some may question my decision to bring figures such as Fuentes to the attention of a wider mainstream public. Grappling with these subjects over the past two years hasn’t always been easy. We started researching in 2019 and were about to start filming in March 2020 when Covid hit. Now here we are, two years on in a culture whose increasing virtuality and virality shows no sign of ending. But for all the challenges we faced, and the difficulties of facing up to content that is upsetting at times, I’d also like to think the job is important and worthwhile, and that the difficulties involved are, among other things, a testament to the timeliness and weight of the subjects. They are powerful and troubling programmes. But I’m proud of how they turned out. Just like the new digital landscape the films reflect, their darkness also presented me with new possibilities for reaching people. The old world, with its heirloom newspapers and broadcasters monopolising debate, is gone. Now we face a chorus of maverick voices – some hateful, some benign, all of them disruptive, and no longer confined to trailers in Montana.

2/10/2022,"The New South Wales auditor general has warned her unqualified audit of the state’s finances could be at risk after the secretary of transport told a public hearing he had not yet agreed to provide an extra $5.2bn to fund a controversial rail corporation. A day after her scathing report accused the NSW Treasury of being “unnecessarily obstructive” during her audit of the government’s finances, auditor general Margaret Crawford told a parliamentary inquiry on Thursday that her unqualified audit would need to be “reaffirmed” after earlier evidence from transport secretary Rob Sharp.  At the centre of Crawford’s extraordinary report was the Transport Asset Holding Entity (Tahe), a corporation established by the NSW government to hold $40bn in NSW rail assets, in a move that had the effect of inflating the state’s budget by several billion dollars. Crawford’s signoff on the state’s overall finances was delayed by three months last year as a result of what she labeled “significant accounting issues” with the body. Her office eventually gave the government an unqualified audit on the state’s finances on Christmas Eve after the government agreed to inject a further $5.2bn into Tahe. However, during evidence to the inquiry earlier on Thursday, Sharp suggested negotiations on the access fees paid to Tahe remained ongoing and that his department had not signed off on the agreement. “The agreement was to agree to a framework [to] negotiate in February and March the actual agreement,” he said. “We know what the number [put forward by Tahe] is but as I indicated we do have a formal negotiation process we go through – all of these are up for discussion.” The evidence sent shock waves through the office of the auditor, who gave evidence to the public inquiry shortly after Sharp. In her opening statement, Crawford told the hearing she had been “quite alarmed” by Sharp’s evidence because she had been told that the $5.2bn payment had been agreed to before signing off on the audit. “We agreed in good faith to accept the heads of agreement undertakings [but] on the basis of what we’ve heard today we will now have to reaffirm those commitments,” she said. Crawford’s deputy, Ian Goodwin, told the inquiry that if the extra funding was not secured then “we’re back to where we were before December”. The Guardian previously revealed that on 18 December a heads of agreement deal was signed between Tahe and its “customers”, the state’s rail networks, to inject funds into the corporation. The extra funding was part of an “access fee” paid to Tahe by transport for use of the state’s rail network. But only $1.1bn of the extra funding had been agreed to up to 2024-25, meaning another $4.1bn would be required over the 10-year agreement. Asked at the inquiry by Labor’s shadow treasurer Daniel Mookhey whether the new information could impact her unqualified audit of the state’s finances, Crawford said it “does have consequences”. The funding agreement, she said, was “one of the key matters that meant that we could be satisfied [there would be] a reasonable return on the state’s equity investment into Tahe”. “We accepted in good faith that that would be followed through on quickly and [the] heads of agreement would be turned into a legal agreement. I think that now needs to be clarified,” she said. Crawford’s evidence comes just 24 hours after her scathing report accused Treasury of having “tested the constructive partnership” between the two offices by withholding key information about Tahe during her audit. Giving evidence, Goodwin said it was “not the first time we’ve heard evidence presented to this committee that is [the] first time we’ve heard a fact”. He said that Treasury had left the auditor’s office with him in no doubt that the heads of agreement would be executed as it was presented to them before the finances were signed off, revealing the document even had a table that included the $5.2bn. “The $5.2bn was never in question. The evidence presented that it might be in question is the first time this office has heard that and we need to clarify that because that’s important,” he said. “If the $5.2bn doesn’t have reality it undermines the projections Treasury put to the audit about the rate of return and we’re back to where we were before December.” He told the inquiry that during discussions with a senior Treasury official last year it had been made “quite clear to me that those amounts would follow through and if they didn’t everyone would be embarrassed”. Earlier on Thursday the new secretary of the treasury department, Paul Grimes, told the inquiry he would order an “independent assessment” of the processes that led to the “important, serious matters” raised in the auditor’s report. The premier, Dominic Perrottet, said on Thursday he had yet to read the auditor’s report but that if Treasury “needs to review its processes in relation to its engagement, whether the auditor general or any of the other integrity agencies, they should take that on board and adopt that process”. “What’s important is that the government considers it, the relevant minister focuses on it and ensures that within the public service changes that need to be made in relation to a whole range of areas are taken on board and adopted and that’s what my expectation would be,” he said.",News/Australia news,‘Quite alarmed’: NSW auditor general says she will reconsider approval of state’s finances,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/quite-alarmed-nsw-auditor-general-says-she-will-reconsider-approval-of-states-finances
2/10/2022,"New Zealand officialdom is wielding a new frontline force against the Ottawa-inspired anti-vaccine convoy occupying the capital’s inner city: parking wardens. Since Tuesday, Wellington has faced traffic delays and closed streets, as a collective of anti-vaccine-mandate protesters left cars, vans and buses parked in the capital city in their effort to occupy parliament’s lawn.  By Thursday afternoon, the protesters’ time was up, and the wardens hit the streets, apparently with popular support from the city’s residents. Wellington city council said it had issued about 120 tickets, and was still dishing out fines. Each warden was accompanied by two police officers for their safety. Fines of NZ$40-$60 (£20-£30) apiece were issued for parking in bus stops, on yellow lines, and the broader charge of “inconsiderate parking”. Those who opted to remain and ignore their fines would be towed, a spokesperson said. The council said it had received demands from frustrated Wellingtonians that they start issuing tickets and an outpouring of support – a rare occurrence for parking wardens, who are not always viewed with universal affection by residents. The council had been “a heavy amount” of correspondence “from Wellingtonians about the fact that we need to get in there and sock it to these protesters basically”, a spokesperson said. “The amount of support we’ve had … is very, you know, very unusual for parking wardens – they don’t usually get support for enforcement.” On social media, some protesters and their affiliates took novel approaches to enforcement efforts – with some advising that if they refused to provide consent to be arrested or issued a ticket, it was not legally binding. Others believed they could issue their own counter-fine of $40,000 to the council for breaching their wishes by putting a ticket on the car. “Let’s see whether that works for them,” the council spokesperson said. “That’s not our concern. Regardless of whether we have their consent, they will be towed.” New Zealanders who object to the vaccine make up a small fragment of the overall population – 95% of those aged 12 and over are now vaccinated with two doses. Estimates of the convoy protesters’ numbers have fluctuated as the crowd wanes – from up to 3,000 down to about 1-200.",News/World news,Wellington unleashes parking wardens in operation to remove Covid protesters,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/wellington-unleashes-parking-wardens-in-operation-to-remove-covid-protesters
2/10/2022,"There is a shadow-life to things. From the iron rail at the edge of the aqueduct, the abyss plunges through trees down to the river. Low winter sunlight casts shadows of the piers (pillars) like the ribcage of some great creature straddling the gorge. This massive shadow seems to move, to have a life, an animus free of the stone and iron that make this wonder of the industrial age. At 38 metres above the River Dee, Pontcysyllte is the highest navigable aqueduct in the world. Its 18 piers span 307 metres, carrying the “stream in the sky” – the Llangollen canal – across the Vale of Llangollen. Yes, it is an engineering feat worthy of its Unesco world heritage site status, but it is not just the genius of engineers such as Thomas Telford that should be recognised, but the lives of all the workers and their families who toiled for years after the first stone was laid in 1795, a dangerous place where many died.  It also stands for those bargees and their horses and canal folk who plied the waterways around the country. Wood smoke rises from the narrowboats of those who inherit that nomadic life. There is a piddling sound as water leaks from a cast iron joint into the void below. The canal’s water level is maintained by Horseshoe Falls, a weir on the Dee beyond Llangollen. Water diverted into the canal, through nature’s shadow engineering, is returning to the river. The aqueduct’s shadow is the kind of spirit thing that in superstitions changes the destiny of what, or who, it touches. Local people say that the aqueduct has a strange kind of tranquillity for such a huge construction. To see the shadow of a narrowboat float softly through that impossible space across the treetops is a dreamlike experience. Only birds can fly through the same space. The light changes by the minute. The River Dee has a song of restless travel. The aqueduct is also not so fixed; it has a shadow-life, a thing that roams the valley – moody, ephemeral and transformative.
