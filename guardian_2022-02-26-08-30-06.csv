2/26/2022,"Ralf Rangnick believes Marcus Rashford can draw inspiration from Jadon Sancho as the forward tries to lift himself out of a run of poor form. Rashford started Wednesday’s Champions League last-16 first leg draw at Atlético Madrid but an anonymous display caused him to be replaced on 75 minutes by Anthony Elanga, who scored United’s equaliser. The 24-year-old has only five goals in 22 appearances but Rangnick cited Sancho, who has scored twice and made two assists in his past six games, as an example of another player who struggled previously before enjoying an upturn. “We had a very similar situation as I can remember with Jadon six or seven weeks ago,” the interim manager said. “He is the best example of what can happen. It’s the player himself who has to perform and get the best out of his own performance and this is the same with Marcus.” Rangnick said Rashford is fully fit. “He is definitely not injured,” the German said. “I have personally spoken a lot with him. It’s with him like with all players: when it counts and they are on the pitch – he started against Atlético Madrid – just have to perform. I am pretty sure he is not happy with his performance right now but it doesn’t help if we discuss that every week and talk about our thoughts about what it might be … “Right now he is trying to find his best possible shape and performance, and we just try to give him helping hands with everything we can. We show him video footage, and we speak with him regularly. In training he is in top form – that is why I decided to play him. Now it’s about having that transformation from training to [competitive games] and this is the next step he has to take.” Rangnick indicated he is content for Rashford and Sancho, who are predominantly wide players, to operate on either wing. “Marcus has played on the right [as well as left] and I remember in the game against Arsenal the last game when Michael Carrick [as caretaker] was in charge he did well in that game so for me it’s not a question of who plays left or right.”",Sport/Football,Ralf Rangnick urges Marcus Rashford to draw inspiration from Jadon Sancho,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/ralf-rangnick-urges-marcus-rashford-jadon-sancho-manchester-united
2/26/2022,"Antonio Conte has promised to continue delivering home truths at Tottenham, no matter how brutal, as he suggested his explosive outburst after Wednesday’s defeat at Burnley was merely a sign of how much he cares. The manager offered another one on Friday when he admitted the club was in a much worse state than he had imagined when he joined last November. “Maybe in my heart, in my mind and my head I thought to find a situation not better but more ready to fight and to win,” Conte said, as he prepared for Saturday’s Premier League game at Leeds. “Instead I found a situation where we have to work a lot, much more than was my expectation to do. “But I am not scared about the work. Only through work have I reached an important level in my career. When I arrived here, I did not ask anything. But at the same time, I know that if I arrive here, they know they are taking an important coach, not a medium coach.” Conte was overcome by rage after Burnley, which was a fourth league defeat in five matches, with resignation about the club’s situation prominent among his emotions. He said that he could not go on like his, adding “maybe I’m not the right guy”, sparking fears he might quit. The Italian eased them as he looked ahead to Leeds but there was no rowing back on his combative style, nor will there be. Conte, who has regularly shone a harsh light on the squad’s shortcomings, was asked whether his outbursts risked destabilising the players and club. The gist of his answer was that if they did, the players were no good to him anyway. “If you tell the truth, you destabilise?” Conte said. “In my opinion and in my education … my family said to me: ‘With the truth, you grow. With a lie you destabilise people.’ If I destabilise someone, [he is] not good man, [it is] not a good club. I want a strong club, strong men, strong players. The truth is the only way that I know to grow.” Conte said his problem was that he is a “perfectionist” and so when results slip his reaction will always be the same. He can only be himself. “When you lose a game, I’m not the person to have dinner with,” he said. “My mood is very bad. I prefer to stay alone … to live the defeat, metabolise the defeat. For sure, I need one day to recover – at least. There are many coaches that don’t suffer. Sometimes I envy them. “When I lose, if you expect me to come to a press conference and laugh … I am not this person. I am sorry if I show my disappointment because maybe it would be good to keep this inside and not show my emotion. But it is difficult for me to lie or hide the truth. I am a person who hates to lose and maybe in this club not many are used to having this type of person. “I’m enjoying my time in Tottenham and especially when I show disappointment after a defeat, it means I feel commitment for the club. Others can think: ‘We win, tomorrow we lose, one day [we] have to go’ … and he doesn’t care. No. I want to leave something important for this club.” Conte said he had spoken to the chairman, Daniel Levy, after the Burnley game and that they understood each other. Asked whether he could guarantee he would stay until the end of the season, Conte said: “In this moment, I guarantee the best commitment I can give to the club. I have another season of contract but you know very well that football is strange. You can have three, four years of contract and the club can sack you. Sometimes, someone decides to go away. “You know that football changes quickly. But in this moment, I repeat, I am totally committed to Tottenham and I have a good relationship with the club, especially with Daniel. He knows very well what are my thoughts for the present and what is my vision. Everything. It is best to have a direct way with the owner. It is OK.”",Sport/Football,Antonio Conte vows to continue telling home truths at Tottenham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/antonio-conte-vows-to-continue-telling-home-truths-at-tottenham
2/26/2022,"Everton are expected to silence the air-raid siren that sounds before matches at Goodison Park when Manchester City visit on Saturday out of consideration for the Ukraine internationals Vitalii Mykolenko and Oleksandr Zinchenko. The move comes amid support from several Premier League clubs for players affected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. West Ham’s manager David Moyes has given the former Ukraine captain Andriy Yarmolenko time off after the attack on his country, with the winger not in the right frame of mind to play against Wolves on Sunday. “He’s not in a very good position at the moment,” Moyes said. “We’ve given him a few days off. We’ll do all we can to help him – it’s a really difficult time for him and his family. I spoke with him yesterday and he was upset, which you can imagine. We just hope his family keep safe.” Two Ukraine internationals could be involved when Everton host the Premier League leaders. The club has sounded an air-raid siren before its traditional Z-Cars theme as a way of galvanising the Goodison crowd in recent seasons but that is likely to be dropped given the situation in Ukraine. Mykolenko, who joined Everton only last month from Dynamo Kyiv, has written on social media about the worry of being unable to help his parents back home. Several Everton supporters’ groups have produced a banner that features the 22-year-old, his country’s colours and the words “We stand with Ukraine” for Saturday’s game. Frank Lampard says a decision on whether to select Mykolenko against City will be down to the player. “I wouldn’t try to force him into a direction,” the Everton manager said. “The decision will be his. The feeling I get is that by coming here and feeling our support in training, it is a small period where his mind is not on other things. That is what it feels like at the minute and I’ll keep tabs on that day by day. “In terms of us as a club, we’re here to support him in any way we can. He just needs to know we are here for him. How we can help with his family, all we can do at this point is support him. He’s been good, training well. Training is a mini-escape in terms of what is going on in his head. In tough moments it can help a young lad in a tough position. I know there are many others in tougher positions but he has been fine.” Zinchenko, who has captained Ukraine, took part in a vigil outside Manchester Central Library on Thursday along with hundreds of his compatriots. Pep Guardiola said: “What would you do if someone attacked the UK? How would you react? How would you feel? It’s what he feels [to protest]. Unfortunately around the world there are many wars – this is a new one. It’s more than a pity because innocent people are dying when these innocent people just want to live in peace. “He is worried. What would we feel if in our country, where we were born and have family and friends, innocent people are being killed? How will you feel? I guess that’s what he feels. Of course, the team and the club is close to him, unconditionally.” The City manager confirmed the 25-year-old was available for the game at Goodison. “Oleks is an incredible, strong guy,” he said. “Of course it’s not easy at the moment but in training yesterday he was brilliant so he’s ready to play in case he has to.” Everton, meanwhile, have appointed Kevin Thelwell as their new director of football. The 48-year-old joins from New York Red Bulls, where he was head of sport, and was previously sporting director at Wolves. He replaces Marcel Brands, who left the relegation-threatened club in December.",Sport/Football,Everton to silence air-raid siren out of respect for Ukraine internationals,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/everton-to-silence-air-raid-siren-out-of-respect-for-ukraine-internationals
2/26/2022,"Thomas Tuchel has admitted that he and his players are worried and distracted by the “uncertainty” created by the Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, being named in parliament on Thursday. Tuchel said he was aware that Chelsea could be affected if the UK government targets Abramovich with sanctions after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The manager acknowledged that Chelsea could not ignore that a Labour MP told parliament that Abramovich was identified by the Home Office in 2019 as having links to the Russian state as well as to “corrupt activity and practices”. Telling MPs that he was quoting from a Home Office document leaked to him, Chris Bryant suggested that the UK should seize Abramovich’s assets and bar him from owning Chelsea. Bryant also questioned why nothing more had been done about the 55-year-old’s UK assets given this official verdict. Abramovich has put huge sums into Chelsea since buying the club in 2003 and Tuchel faced questions about the situation before his side face Liverpool in Sunday’s Carabao Cup final. Tuchel said that his mind was “clouded” after the outbreak of war and he was asked about the potential impact on Chelsea employees and supporters if Abramovich were targeted by sanctions. Abramovich has vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin and Russia or that he has done anything to merit sanctions being imposed against him. “I am aware of all these scenarios and I am aware of all these discussions at the moment,” Tuchel said. “I would love to take my right not to comment on this until there is a decision made. But we are aware of it and it’s distracting us, it’s worrying us. To a certain degree I can understand the opinions and the critical opinions towards the club, towards us who represent that club. I can understand that and we cannot fully free ourselves from it. “Maybe people understand that me as a coach or the players, we don’t have the insight what is really going on. At the moment we don’t feel responsible for all this. We feel that it is horrible and there can be no doubt about it. War in Europe was unthinkable for me for a long period. The impact is clear and the discussions have an impact. Let’s be a bit more patient and understand what the measurements will be and then we have to maybe deal with it.” In 2018 Abramovich withdrew his application for a new UK investor visa, amid worsening links between the UK and Russia. Abramovich has an Israeli passport and has since travelled to the UK using that. Last November he attended his first Chelsea match at Stamford Bridge in more than three years and he has continued to give the club huge financial backing. Chelsea won the Champions League last season and collected the 21st trophy of the Abramovich era with the Club World Cup this month. But Tuchel accepted that Chelsea could be under a harsher spotlight now and he did not shy away from a question about Abramovich being named in parliament. “You’re right, we should not pretend that this is not an issue and I agree,” Tuchel said. “The situation in general, for me and for my staff and for everybody here at the Cobham, for the players, is horrible. Nobody expected this. “It’s pretty unreal, it’s clouding our minds, it’s clouding excitement towards the final and it brings huge uncertainty. Much more to all people and families who are actually more involved than us. And our best wishes and our regards and thoughts are obviously with them. “Still, there are so many uncertainties around the situation of our club and of the situation in the UK with scenarios like this that it makes no sense if I comment on it. We are aware of it, we have not so much inside information as you think and in the very end, and don’t understand me wrong, I think it’s also derived from the team and from the staff, and I include myself, to be maybe not political. To do do sports and to focus on sports. Not because we are hiding. The situation is clear, it’s horrible, there is no doubt about it.” Tuchel said that he would not try to take his mind off the crisis in Ukraine before the Liverpool game. “I think you can’t,” he said. “I think the situation is too big and it is not an isolated situation somewhere. It concerns Europe, it’s in Europe and we are part of Europe. We cannot say let’s put this to the side. It’s the opposite. We have to live with it right now. There is no running away from it. “There is no shutting the doors and now we focus on football. We are still privileged to live in peace and freedom right here where we are right now. And we are still privileged to have a game of football, to have an emotional but peaceful environment with fans in the stadium.”",Sport/Football,Tuchel admits Chelsea concerned and distracted by Abramovich ‘uncertainty’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/tuchel-admits-chelsea-concerned-and-distracted-by-abramovich-uncertainty
2/26/2022,"There have perhaps never been greater differences surrounding the circumstances surrounding one manager’s last game in his old job, and the first game in his new one. Three years ago, Mark Hughes’s tenure as Southampton manager came to an end with a 2-2 draw against a Manchester United side managed by José Mourinho which featured Paul Pogba, Romelu Lukaku and Marcus Rashford. This Saturday, it is Mansfield Town and players such as Lucas Akins and Jordan Bowery who stand in Hughes’s way for his match as manager of League Two side Bradford City. The challenges are different too. Back then, Hughes was fighting to keep Southampton in the Premier League and retain his record of having never managed outside the top flight. That record officially disappears when he takes charge of Bradford, who are 15th and 10 points adrift of the play-offs. It is one of the more remarkable appointments in recent memory. But while so much is different about the circumstances Hughes will walk into at Valley Parade on Saturday, he insists one thing remains the same. “I’ll still have that same excitement about this match as I did with the last one,” he says. “It will absolutely be no different to managing in the Premier League in that regard. The build to a game is great, being on the grass and training, but by far the best thing is the matchday itself. It’s turning up there, seeing the crowd build and it’s the thing I’ve missed the most, without a shadow of a doubt.” With around 15,000 spectators expected on Saturday, including a large travelling contingent from Mansfield, the 58-year-old is being given a soft opening, of sorts, to life in the lower leagues. Having spent three years out of coaching, there will be keen interest in Hughes to see how he adjusts to not only his return, but his first experience of a new level with a group of players that are complete unknowns to him. For Hughes though, this is a chance to make a significant impact at a club which has sacked seven managers in the last four seasons alone. “It’s happened very quickly, but all the information is out there and anything I need to know about Bradford and I can find out very quickly,” he says. “It’s a club I would like to put my mark on in terms of driving them forward from the low ebb they are at right now.” The big question though is: why Bradford? “There were opportunities to return elsewhere but some of them coincided with Covid restrictions and I found it very difficult to get enthused about football behind closed doors,” Hughes says. “That maybe shaped my view on a couple of opportunities but this is good timing. “It’s a good opportunity and I get a chance to look at the players I’ve got and the structure of the club and look at maybe what’s desperately needed to push it forward.” There is so much mystery and intrigue surrounding this move, nobody is quite sure what to expect, least of all Hughes, who will be exposed to away trips at places like Forest Green and Sutton United before the end of the season. But the one thing you can guarantee is this will be a story well worth following. With Bradford so far adrift of the League Two play-offs, it is not unthinkable he will still be managing in the fourth tier next season. “That doesn’t faze me at all,” Hughes says. “There will be a period of adjustment but it’s up to me to make that as short and sharp as possible. I’m excited for the challenge.” You wonder if Hughes will feel the same come 5pm on Saturday evening.",Sport/Football,Manchester United to Mansfield: Mark Hughes relishing Bradford bow,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/manchester-united-to-mansfield-mark-hughes-relishing-bradford-bow
2/26/2022,"San Francisco’s troubled Millennium Tower, which has continued to sink despite multimillion dollar efforts to correct it, has developed yet another problem. The luxury tower, popular among star athletes and retired Google employees before the tilting issues were widely publicized, has sunk 18in since its construction was completed in 2009 and has a 26in tilt at the top. Now, the engineer overseeing the retrofit of the tower has said the movement caused the formation of a one-inch gap between the building and a smaller 12-story adjacent structure. “Given the present westward tilt of the building, about 24 inches as measured at the roof, the gap between the two buildings in the east-west direction has widened by about 1 inch[2.5cm],” the project engineer, Ron Hamburger, said in a statement to NBC Bay Area. The Millennium Tower uses an underground parking garage housed within the smaller structure. Despite the gap, engineers “determined that the building is not at risk due to this movement, or any movement likely to occur before construction completion”, Hamburger said, and the gap is not expected to worsen. He has previously warned that the tower’s elevators and plumbing may no longer work if sinking continues at its current rate. Engineers are working on a retrofit of the building and plan to install 18 steel piles to bedrock, relieving pressure on the foundation, to stop further tilting and sinking as well as possibly reverse some of the movement. “Once the voluntary upgrade is complete, further settlement of the building at the northwest corner will be arrested, some rebound will occur, and slight additional settlement of the rest of the main tower will act to reverse the tilting that has occurred and close the gap between the elevator thresholds in the adjacent podium building that connects the main tower and mid-rise together,” Hamburger told the San Francisco Chronicle. Previous efforts to reinforce the foundation of the downtown tower came to a halt last summer, when engineers found the building had sunk an inch in the months since the attempted repairs started.",News/US news,An inch apart: new troubles for San Francisco’s Millennium Tower,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/25/inch-san-francisco-millennium-tower
