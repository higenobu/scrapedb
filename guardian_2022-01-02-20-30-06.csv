1/2/2022,"Government policy towards Covid-19 has come full circle. For now, at least, England has returned to the Swedish way of dealing with the pandemic. Tough, officially imposed lockdowns are out. Trusting the people to do the sensible thing is back in. Whether this approach will survive the expected surge in hospitalisations from Christmas and New Year revelries remains to be seen. Boris Johnson is the master of the screeching U-turn and with the number of infections hitting new records pressure on Downing Street to act is growing. We have been here before.  Back in the early days of the pandemic the prime minister was minded to copy Sweden, a country that imposed few restrictions and decided early on that it needed to learn to live with the virus. The prime minister’s flirtation with the “Swedish experiment” was brief, and at the end of March 2020 a draconian lockdown was imposed. Ministers knew this would have a dire impact on the economy but felt the risk of the NHS being overwhelmed left them no choice. A paper published in the magazine Nature last year examined what would have happened had Britain followed the Swedish approach. Even assuming the public here would have been as willing to adhere to non-mandatory recommendations as the Swedes (a pretty big assumption) the UK death rate would have at least doubled. This time, the decision is a lot less clear cut, not least because vaccines are providing protection from the virus. The news from South Africa, one of the countries where Omicron first surfaced, has also been encouraging. While more transmissible, the new variant has resulted in fewer hospitalisations and deaths. Case numbers, after rising rapidly, have now started to decline. A degree of caution is needed when comparing the two countries, because South Africa has a much younger population than Britain, and it is summer rather than the middle of winter there. Even so, it is clear the government has set a high bar for imposing further restrictions. The prime minister’s weakened political position is one reason the government has gone Swedish. The risk of causing serious damage to the economy when it is looking particularly vulnerable is another, because this is going to be a tough year for the British public. Inflation is rising, interest rates are going up, and energy bills are expected to rocket in the spring just as Rishi Sunak’s increase in national insurance contributions comes into force. The cumulative effect is a whopping cut to living standards. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank the average household is going to be £1,000 a year worse off. Those on the lowest incomes will be especially hard hit by soaring gas and electricity bills. In the circumstances, it is easy to see why the government is reluctant to add to the economic pain by imposing tougher restrictions to slow the spread of the Omicron variant. Fresh curbs mean slower growth and a hit to the public finances. They would also test the resilience of the labour market. The Swedes came in for a lot of criticism for their go-it-alone approach. While death rates were much lower than the initial pessimistic forecasts, they were still higher than in neighbouring Scandinavian countries, where tough restrictions were imposed. Moreover, the initial hit to the economy was as severe in liberal Sweden as it was in locked-down Denmark. That said, as the second anniversary of Covid’s arrival looms, governments are beginning to see merits in the Swedish approach. In part, that’s because Sweden now has a lower death rate than countries that went down the full lockdown route, including the UK, France, Spain and Italy. It is in the bottom half of the EU league table for deaths once the size of population is taken into account. Economic recovery has been pretty brisk. The UK is still struggling to get back to pre-Covid levels of output: Sweden had managed that by the middle of 2021. But there are other factors, too. Sweden has avoided the problem of lockdown fatigue and has not caused damage to the life chances of its children because schools were kept open throughout the pandemic. All of which suggests the Nature paper will not be the last word on the Swedish experiment. There have been precious few upsides to the pandemic but one of them is that it has thrown up rich country-by-country data for academics from all disciplines – epidemiologists, economists, educationalists, sociologists – to examine and argue about. Even within countries different approaches have been tried. The four constituent nations of the UK have exercised their own powers, so it should soon be possible to assess the impact of closing nightclubs in Scotland and Wales, but not in England, for New Year’s Eve. EU countries have varied in their approach, while the US provides 50 states to study. What is clear is that no one country got everything right and all made mistakes, unsurprisingly enough given they weren’t expecting a global pandemic. It is also obvious, as time passes, that governments – be they in London, Edinburgh, Rome or Paris – are only tightening restrictions with reluctance. In a way, that’s a backhanded compliment to the Swedes for perhaps being on to something right from the start.",News/Business,A wounded PM and ailing economy forces England to ‘go Swedish’ on Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/02/a-wounded-pm-and-ailing-economy-forces-england-to-go-swedish-on-covid
1/2/2022,"Women today are experiencing the “inherited trauma” of the persecution and execution of their forebears who were branded as witches, according to the curator of a new exhibition on the period known as the Burning Times. Thousands of women were accused of witchcraft in the UK and Ireland between 1450 and 1750. Many were tortured until they identified relatives and neighbours as witches; those deemed guilty were hanged or burned at the stake.  “The Burning Times affected everyone within a community – men, women and children alike, not just those branded as witches,” said Cali White, the exhibition’s lead curator. “Our whole nation was traumatised and divided by what became a mass hysteria, passed down over generations. The legacy of this has left a collective wound which affects us all in some way, and which we are now being called to understand and heal.” The exhibition seeks to dispel myths of “black pointy hats, devil-worshipping and warty-nosed old women”, instead educating people in the “untold history lesson” of what happened over three centuries. “Witch-hunts affected everybody, not just the witches. It affected whole communities,” said White. It became a way to rid a community of anyone viewed as a problem. “People who questioned the authority of the church or state could easily become a target. Women learned it was safer to stay quiet than to speak up or stand out.” Women were forced to betray each other under torture. “There was fear of betrayal, fear of persecution, fear of ostracisation. And then when the hanging or the burning took place, the whole town was expected to go and watch. Can you imagine watching somebody you know being put to death in such a brutal way?” Witch-hunts “divided our communities, taught us to play small in order to survive and broke our trust in the people closest to us. The scars we still carry show up in many ways: 25 generations on, we are left feeling powerless, isolated, stuck, divided, unsafe and unsupported,” said White. Last year, a campaign was launched in Scotland to pardon about 2,500 women who were burned at the stake, often after prolonged torture, and for a national memorial to be created. Accusations of witchcraft were four times higher in Scotland than elsewhere, according to Claire Mitchell QC, the campaign’s founder. According to White, there are 36 countries in the world where witch hunts still take place, resulting in thousands of people tortured and killed every year. Half the profits from the exhibition will be donated to charities working to stop modern-day witch-hunts. But witches are also being reclaimed as a “positive force”, said White. “There’s a younger generation that has grown up with the likes of Harry Potter, for whom being a witch has become a positive identity.” Witch groups have large followings on social media, and for some it is a “pathway to spirituality”. The centrepiece of the exhibition is a memorial comprising 4,000 hand-printed and stitched pieces of fabric, each bearing the name of a woman found in records of witch trials in the UK and Ireland. More than 1,000 women across the world were involved in making the memorial, which White described as “beautiful, very feminine and very tactile”. The exhibition, created by the Silver Spoons Collective, also includes interactive installations, painting, film, music and storytelling. “We offer a powerful opportunity for reflection and reconnection, and the chance to be part of a growing movement for social change and healing,” said White.

1/2/2022,"Hang on, wait there a minute, I want to show you something,” says Gabriela Hearst, hopping up from her chair in her airy Manhattan office and reaching for something on the shelves in the background of her Zoom frame. “These are my journals from when I was 16 or 17 – let me check the date, um 1993, yes I was 17 and look!” She flattens a page full of colourful teenage drawings and holds it up to the camera: “I designed a whole freaking shoe collection!” That these journals remain within reaching distance of the fashion designer’s desk in her Chelsea studio is testament to the fact that despite the success she has achieved, Hearst never forgets where she came from. As creative director of her award-winning brand, founded in 2015, and a year into the same prestigious role at the fashion house Chloé, it would be an understatement to say that Hearst is hot property in the fashion world right now.  Not only can she count the likes of Angelina Jolie, Gillian Anderson, Greta Thunberg and Jill Biden as fans of her brand (she dressed the latter in the embroidered white coat for the evening of the 2020 inauguration), but she is making all the right kind of fashion headlines for her determination to demonstrate to an industry famed for its unsustainable practices that sustainable innovation can make good business sense, too. It’s also a serious asset that her husband, John Augustine Hearst – a senior member of the Hearst Corporation and an heir to one of the wealthiest families in America – is involved in the self-financed company. Since day one of her eponymous brand, which is famed for its luxe-craft aesthetic, she has raised the bar for how to run a luxury fashion house sustainably. She has set a goal to use 80% deadstock fabric within three years and no virgin materials by 2022. Her first fashion-week catwalk in 2016 – where she brought chairs from her house and donated the metal floorboards from the show when it was over – laid the foundations for the first-ever carbon-neutral fashion show in September 2019. Earlier that same year her brand declared itself plastic-free, “front and back of house”, using recycled cardboard hangers and bio-based TIPA packaging that is fully compostable. And she has re-romanticised the idea of waiting lists, making her handbags more or less to order to avoid any waste. It’s a passion which comes from the bucolic childhood that Hearst likes to keep as close to heart as she does to hand. Born into a sixth generation of ranchers in remote Uruguay in November 1976, she spent her childhood living pretty much off the grid, herding cattle from a young age at her parents’ 17,000-acre ranch in Paysandú. “It is extremely remote,” she emphasises. “When I was a kid and it would rain, you wouldn’t get out because the rivers would flood. We would have to plan a whole year of what we would eat because you couldn’t just pop to the supermarket or deli.” In the absence of a TV, the radio provided entertainment, while for the designer, “My toy was my imagination,” she says. “A lot of the creativity I have today is from using my imagination [back then]. Imagination is all problem solving, right? On a ranch you have to use it a lot; you can’t just bring in an expert if something doesn’t work. That time taught me that essentially quality comes from a utilitarian perspective… and even in a humble environment there is high quality, because everything is made to last a lifetime.” This rationale – and the rhythms of following nature in her early developmental years – is what Hearst credits her appreciation of the earth and its resources to. She also has an innate understanding of how to use common sense: “Resetting your mind on what needs to be done in order to function? Ways to prioritise was ingrained in my upbringing!” she says. Such formative years would go on to create a force to be reckoned with later down the line. In 2017, she won the prestigious womenswear International Woolmark Prize; in May 2018, she won Pratt’s Fashion Visionary Award for her commitment to sustainability; in April 2019, LVMH Luxury Ventures took a minority stake in the business; she was named the Fashion Council of America’s Womenswear Designer of the Year in 2020 (the fashion equivalent to the Oscars); and last month she was named a Leader of Change at the British Fashion Awards. “This recognition humbly gives us more drive for the road ahead,” she told her followers on Instagram (where, by the way, you can find her high-kicking her way into buying meetings, demonstrating how to wear her designs, and sharing inspirational images of her mother herding criollos horses). Hearst’s own road to success, it transpires, has been as dynamic as she is. Turning the page in her journal, she proudly holds up a sketch that reads: ‘I am going to Australia!’ “When you live in Uruguay, you are really far away from everything and [when I was 17] I wanted to go to Australia like nothing else in the world. I told everyone I was going there and they said I was crazy,” she explains. “Then one day a friend told me about a scholarship that would take me there. There was one place, I applied with this whole presentation and I got it.” After returning to Uruguay, Hearst convinced her mother to let her get a paid job to save money to go and see a friend in New York who she had met during her scholarship. “I arrived [in New York] in 1994 when I was 18 and within hours I said, I am going to live here,” she says matter-of-factly. Six years later, she made the move a permanent one, enrolling at the Neighbourhood Playhouse School of the Theatre to study performing arts. After persuading her father to pay for her fees – “convincing my father who was a Gaucho to pay for acting school in New York was my best performance ever” – she worked around her studies to cover her living costs. While a career on stage proved not to be her calling, she took an important lesson from her time there. “We studied Meisner technique, which I got,” she says. “It’s the technique of being truthful – of dealing with the truth [it takes] to perform and performing from a place of truth. It was a remarkable experience and without it I wouldn’t be able to do interviews like this or be so present [today].” None of her friends or family are surprised that Hearst ended up as a fashion designer, she says, although she admits to falling into it by coincidence. Before Gabriela Hearst and long before Chloé, came Candela, the womenswear brand she started with two partners and $750 each. “At that point, if it didn’t work out, I would have needed to go back to selling cattle with my dad – so I gave it my all!” she laughs. “I don’t recommend it, but at the time it was like 0% APR and so we maxed out credit cards [to get it started]. Luckily the business went from zero to a million dollars in no time so we were able to pay it off.” It was Candela that taught Hearst the nitty gritty of supply chains and logistics, for which she is grateful, but ultimately led to disillusion. “We were making [clothes] for the contemporary market at cheap prices and low quality and there was a total disconnect for me.” In 2011, her father died and she inherited his ranch (that she still runs remotely to this day). Finding herself back in Paysandú “working with tradition, organising animals, [watching] the circle of life” she knew something had to change. “I thought about it and I said, ‘If I am going to put something new out there, it needs to be better made and with a lower environmental impact to anything else.” Four years later, and after much research and planning, her brand was born in partnership with her husband, with whom she has three children, Jack, six, and Olivia and Mia, both 13. It was with his encouragement that Hearst pursued the top job at Chloé, which came about in characteristic go-getting style. “I had one of these crazy Gabi moments when I told my future boss, ‘Look, my name is Gabi, just like the founder Gaby [Aghion] so this is it’!” she laughs. “Then of course I did a 92-page presentation and justified my thought process, but it was really meant to be because it’s a language I love.” To achieve a work-life balance while heading up two of the most successful fashion brands in the world is “very challenging”, she says. “But I have a very supportive family. My husband’s responsibilities changed and adapted so there’s definitely sacrifice.” Living a “moderated” life that includes bed by 9.30pm to get at least eight hours’ sleep a night, exercise and a healthy diet – “I mean, I’ll derail in certain pressure times and eat too many freaking gummy bears and drink too many coffees, sure” – she believes in keeping a clear head so she can “access information from the subconscious” and she picks what takes her away from home carefully. In November, Hearst spent her birthday in Glasgow on a panel at Cop26 talking about achieving climate success through low-impact business models. “To spend your birthday away from your kids is painful and so if I’m going to do it, I really wanted it to be worth it, and it was.” Her work as trustee of Save the Children since 2018 has also turned her attention to Ghana, Kenya and most recently Afghanistan. Not for the first time, she leveraged the exclusivity of her waiting lists and limited-edition designs this December and donated 100% of net proceeds across all items in her flagship stores in London and New York as well as her website to the charity’s Afghanistan Crisis Children’s Relief Fund. “I don’t like it when brands bombard me with gifting lists and things like that,” she says. “The period of the holidays is about giving and consciousness of others, so I’m not comfortable with just selling a product to make more money. Can’t we think of other people? Afghanistan is one of the places that is hell on earth right now and why do those children have to suffer? It may not be on the news now, but that doesn’t mean the problem has been eradicated.” This year, she quietly launched the Gabriela Hearst Youth Program in the States, too, to create a space for teenagers to be able to channel anxieties through teaching them about fabrics and the future of fashion design. One of her proudest accomplishments of the year, it says a lot about Hearst’s motivation for doing everything she does. Two of her main takeaways from the Cop26 summit this year were: “Anyone who fights the youth will lose” and that when it comes to the environment, we’re all supposed to leave our kids better off than when we started. “The mission is all worth it,” she says. “I can honestly say to my kids that I tried, I freaking tried.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Fashion designer Gabriela Hearst: ‘I could always have gone back to selling cattle’,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/02/fashion-designer-gabriela-hearst-i-could-have-gone-back-to-selling-cattle
1/2/2022,"A new tax rule will impact millions of small businesses in 2022. You can thank one small change buried in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. Let’s suppose you’re a small business owner or freelancer, and you get paid from a digital payment service like PayPal, Venmo, Zelle, Cash App or any third-party settlement provider that’s accepting credit cards on your behalf and putting money into your bank account. If those payments were for goods and services that you sold to customers, it was previously up to you to make sure you were reporting that income on your tax return. But now, beginning in 2022, if you receive more than $600 in total during the course of the year – regardless of how many customers are paying – your payment service is required to report that amount to the IRS.  Let’s be clear: you should be reporting those amounts as income anyway. But the reality is there are 30 million small businesses, freelancers, solo-preneurs and independent contractors in the US and – if my client base is any indication – many of them who receive a number of small payments from many customers throughout the year may, well, forget. Particularly if – as is often the case – there are many small transactions or their record keeping is sub-par. But no worries! The IRS will now be able to find out what you earned anyway. This means that whether you’re selling products or services on Amazon, Etsy , eBay or at craft shows or just face-to-face, you can now expect to receive a 1099-K form – after 31 January 2023 – from the payment services that you’re using of the revenue they reported on your behalf to the IRS for the purchases of goods and services made in 2022. How do these services know that the purchases were made for goods and services and not just a payment from a friend or family member? Most of them are adding an extra form during the payment process for the payer to identify the nature of the payment. You can also expect more questions this year from your payment service provider. “You may notice that in the coming months we will ask you for your tax information, like a social security number or tax ID, if you haven’t provided it to us already, in order to continue using your account to accept payments for the sale of goods and services transactions and to ensure there aren’t any issues when these changes take effect in 2022,” PayPal warns in a blogpost. This helps us meet our obligations to the IRS and ensures that you will be able to continue using your account and access PayPal and Venmo features and services.” There will be some overlap. For example, if you’re an independent contractor working for a company and you receive more than $600 via a payment service then you’ll likely get both a 1099-MISC from that company and a 1099-K from the payment service. In this situation you’d use the amount on the 1099-MISC and, assuming there are no other amounts from the payment service, you’d disregard the 1099-K. Got it? So what will the government do with this information? Nothing bad, I’m sure. They just want to know more about you and your business, that’s all! According to the IRS the data collected will only be used for “taxpayer education and outreach products and services” as well as “new examination and collection approaches”. Translation: if you’re not reporting the right amount we’re gonna get ya! “For the 2022 tax year, you should consider the amounts shown on your 1099-K when calculating gross receipts for your income tax return,” PayPal warns. “The IRS will be able to cross-reference both our report and yours.” Happy new year, everyone!",News/Business,There’s a new tax rule for US small business owners.

1/2/2022,"In the weeks after my grandfather died in 2019, I spent a melancholy few days sorting through the “Gramps” section of my filing cupboard, mainly the many letters he’d sent to me over the years. It was a way, I suppose, of continuing the 40-year conversation we’d had about books, of keeping his voice loud in my mind. One letter struck me with particular force, though – a page and a half in response to a short story I’d sent him aged 10. It was typical of his letters about my writing: warm yet forthright in its criticism, even at this early stage showing something that I came to recognise as a gift – the fact that he took me seriously as an author, that this was feedback from one writer to another. It’s one of the central messages in Cathy Rentzenbrink’s wise and generous book about the writer’s life, Write it All Down; this idea that one of the hardest things for a writer to do is to take themselves and their work seriously. There is, as she acknowledges early on here, an awful lot of snake oil sold in the creative writing industry: “Books that are too focused on structure make me want to cry,” she says. “Their authors seem to enjoy discussing the classical three-act structure, protagonists and antagonists and all that, but it is just too cold a way to go about things for me, and I know it would never lead to anything good.” Write it All Down is not a book that gives you structure; rather it helps the aspirant writer fashion a vessel into which they might safely pour the contents of their heart.  In a series of short, chatty chapters, Rentzenbrink doles out advice that conveys one central message: that in writing, we become writers. This is not a book whose intended audience has had the privilege of a creative writing MA (or a sternly encouraging grandfather); it’s for anyone who picks up a pen, or sits before the ominously blank computer screen, and wonders if they have it in them to write. Rentzenbrink’s own background is salutary: her father was a miner who couldn’t read or write for most of his life. Her youth was marked with tragedy, as recorded in her devastating memoir The Last Act of Love. She is now a furiously productive author – since that memoir in 2015 she has written four other books, including a brilliantly caustic first novel, Everyone Is Still Alive. Rentzenbrink teaches classes on life writing for Arvon, and at Kestle Barton in Cornwall, and reading Write it All Down feels like a decent second best to being in the classroom with her. She is disarmingly frank about both the limitations of creative writing as an academic discipline – “I don’t have all the answers and don’t believe that anyone does” – and on the challenges of entering an industry that is perhaps the most competitive and least well remunerated of any. Not to mention the physical and mental challenges of getting anything down on paper at all – “almost all writers exist in a continual vortex of despair and doubt”. What Write it All Down does more than anything, though, is to make the reader – the writer! – feel part of a community. Rentzenbrink peppers her work with thoughtful answers to the questions that get in the way of writing: “Should I work if I am ill? What about when depressed? How do I know if I’m doing it right? I keep getting stuck… I’m so confused!” At the end there are messages of solidarity and inspiration from a host of other writers, from Lucy Mangan to Matt Haig to Maggie O’Farrell. They underline the collaborative, confidence-building ethos of the book, which provides an arm around the shoulder as we struggle with that most difficult of things: the “tricky, slippery business” of writing.

1/2/2022,"A whistleblower in the Canadian province of New Brunswick has warned that a progressive neurological illness that has baffled experts for more than two years appears to be affecting a growing number of young people and causing swift cognitive decline among some of the afflicted. Speaking to the Guardian, an employee with Vitalité Health Network, one of the province’s two health authorities, said that suspected cases are growing in number and that young adults with no prior health triggers are developing a catalog of troubling symptoms, including rapid weight loss, insomnia, hallucinations, difficulty thinking and limited mobility.  The official number of cases under investigation, 48, remains unchanged since it was first announced in early spring 2021. But multiple sources say the cluster could now be as many as 150 people, with a backlog of cases involving young people still requiring further assessment. “I’m truly concerned about these cases because they seem to evolve so fast,” said the source. “I’m worried for them and we owe them some kind of explanation.” At the same time, at least nine cases have been recorded in which two people in close contact – but without genetic links – have developed symptoms, suggesting that environmental factors may be involved. One suspected case involved a man who was developing symptoms of dementia and ataxia. His wife, who was his caregiver, suddenly began losing sleep and experiencing muscle wasting, dementia and hallucinations. Now her condition is worse than his. A woman in her 30s was described as non-verbal, is feeding with a tube and drools excessively. Her caregiver, a nursing student in her 20s, also recently started showing symptoms of neurological decline. In another case, a young mother quickly lost nearly 60 pounds, developed insomnia and began hallucinating. Brain imaging showed advanced signs of atrophy. The Vitalité employee, who asked not to be named because they were unauthorized to speak publicly and feared repercussions for speaking out, said they decided to come forward because of growing concerns over the speed with which young people have deteriorated. “This is not a New Brunswick disease,” said the employee. “We’re probably the area that is raising the flag because we’re mostly rural and in an area where people might have more exposure to environmental factors.” But in January, the province of New Brunswick is widely expected to announce that the cluster of cases, first made public last year after a memo was leaked to the media, is the result of misdiagnoses, which have mistakenly grouped unrelated illnesses together. The Special Neurodegenerative Disorder Clinic, also called the Mind Clinic, in the city of Moncton is the clearing house for cases referred from within the region as well as neighbouring provinces. Prospective cases have typically stumped doctors and resisted a battery of standardized neurological tests used to rule out certain conditions. Using a case description guideline developed by a team of neurologists and epidemiologists, the clinic decides if the patients warrant further investigation or if they may have a known illness or disease. Determining who becomes part of the cluster is subjective, largely because the brain is notoriously difficult to study. Certainty is often only obtained after the patient dies and the cerebral tissue can be fully tested. Despite the striking details surrounding the newer cases, the province has worked to tamp down fears. In October, officials suggested that the eight fatal cases were the result of misdiagnosis, arguing that instead of suffering from a shared neurological illness, the victims had died of known and unrelated pathologies. But experts familiar with the cluster are alarmed, largely because of the age of the patients. Neurological illnesses are rare in young people. “The fact that we have a younger spectrum of patients here argues very strongly against what appears to be the preferred position of the government of New Brunswick – that the cases in this cluster are being mistakenly lumped together,” said a scientist at the Canada’s public health agency, who specializes in neurodegenerative illnesses but was unauthorized to speak. In October the province also said an epidemiological report suggested there was no significant evidence of any known food, behaviour or environmental exposure that could explain the illness. Tim Beatty’s father Laurie, a retired hardware employee, died in 2019 after the onset of mental confusion around Christmas marked the beginning of his rapid deterioration. Beatty says the family was “gobsmacked” when he learned his father was one of eight people a pathologist controversially declared was improperly diagnosed and had instead died of Alzheimer’s. Beatty and his sister have pleaded to have their father’s remains tested for neurotoxins, including β-Methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), which some have suggested could be the culprit behind the illness. In one study, high concentrations of BMAA were found in lobster, an industry that drives the economies of many of New Brunswick’s coastal communities. The province’s apparent resistance to testing for suspected environmental factors has led to speculation among families that the efforts to rule out the existence of a cluster could be motivated by political decision making. “If a group of people wanted to breed conspiracy theorists, then our government has done a wonderful job at promoting it,” said Beatty. “Are they just trying to create a narrative for the public that they hope we’ll absorb and walk away from? I just don’t understand it.” Documents obtained through freedom of information requests and seen by the Guardian showed scientists at the country’s public health agency were considering BMAA as a possible cause, but needed the province to order the testing. “I don’t know why the province wouldn’t just simply do the science and look. They have my dad’s remains. We’ve given them full permission to do toxicology and do what needs to be done,” said Beatty. “Yet, nothing has been looked at.” But experts nonetheless warn that testing itself is also more difficult than the public realizes. While some medical tests can provide quick and definite results other types of investigation require far more work. “What people are talking about really amounts to a full research investigation, because then we know what we’re looking for precisely,” said the federal scientist who was familiar with both the cluster and the testing process. “Right now we don’t have a way to interpret simple data that you might get when testing a person’s brain tissue for a particular toxin. For example, how much are ‘elevated’ levels of a neurotoxin compared to the rest of the public? And when does that become a cause for concern?” The scientist said teams are ready to begin the research, but “New Brunswick has specifically told us not to go forward with that work”. Those familiar with the cluster are bracing for a January report, written by the province’s oversight committee, which will determine if the 48 cases are genuinely suffering from a neurological illness or the result of misdiagnosis by neurologists. Amid mounting tension between specialists and the provincial government, a source familiar with the Mind Clinic say the postings for several jobs at the clinic – a social worker, an administrator and a neuropsychologist – were recently made temporary, the budget would no longer be recurrent and the clinic would be converted into a Alzheimer’s and geriatric clinic. Health minister Dorothy Shephard told reporters on 1 December that speculation the clinic would be shut down was untrue. “We keep telling the patients that the country is behind them, and that the tests will be done so that we can figure this out. We tell them we will get to the bottom of this so that we can help them,” said the Vitalité employee. “And so far, that hasn’t happened.

His playful, anthropomorphised illustrations of grinning kittens took Victorian society by storm. This suitably eccentric biopic from director and co-writer Will Sharpe, with Benedict Cumberbatch in the title role, takes Wain’s art as an initial visual key, but goes further, using everything from a heightened palette to woozy Dutch camera angles to shimmering auras to convey Wain’s unsteady mental state. The artist was, not to put too fine a point on it, delusional. As the film tells it, he believed that cats were evolving to communicate with humans, and that they would ultimately turn blue; he was obsessed with the idea of electricity, but believed it to be a free-floating entity that drifted around the ether. But in all the churning chaos in Wain’s mind, there was a place of calm reserved for his wife, Emily (Claire Foy). Through her, and their all-too-brief marriage, he was able to tune out the noise and into the beauty of the world around him. Like Wain’s art, the film is superficially twee – characters are referred to as “nosy poseys” at one point – but under the kitsch is something more rewarding: an affecting portrait of a creative but troubled man.

1/2/2022,"Axel Tuanzebe, the Manchester United defender, is set to join Napoli on loan, putting to an end his spell at Aston Villa.  Tuanzebe, 24, was due to spend the season at Villa in his third loan spell at the club but he has been redirected to Serie A, where Napoli will pay a €500,000 fee to loan him until the end of the 2021-22 season. The former England U21 player spent last season at his parent club, making 18 appearances, but returned last summer to the club for whom he played during two separate spells in the 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons. He has played just six times this season, and Dean Smith, the manager who brought him back to Villa, has since been replaced by Steven Gerrard. The Napoli loan, with paperwork completed, does not include an option to buy the player.

1/2/2022,"Real heroes don’t wear capes, but they do bring duvets. Such as Bex Wilson and her dad, Mark, who spent the night before Christmas bringing beds and duvets to children who would otherwise have been sleeping on the floor or in a bathtub. “It surprises people how many kids in Leeds don’t have beds. It surprised me,” said Wilson.  On Christmas Eve alone, the pair delivered beds to 17 children across Leeds. It would have been 21 beds but one family had a bug infestation so bad it was better to wait before delivering new ones. The week before Christmas, the charity Wilson founded with friends delivered 50 beds. Since 2018 the organisation, Zarach, has given more than 1,400 beds, mattresses, duvets and sheets to families and children who had little prospect of getting them any other way. A teacher at a primary school in Burmantofts, Leeds, Wilson was stunned to find that children in her classes were living in such desperate circumstances. “There was a little boy who was normally fine, and he was having a bad morning, being moody and short with his classmates. So I said to him at the end of the lesson, are you OK? Are you tired? And he just said: ‘I’m always tired, Miss, I don’t have a bed.’ That’s exactly how he said it. “I couldn’t believe it and said, what do you mean you don’t have a bed? And he pulled up his jumper and showed me infected sores on his stomach that were bed bug bites, from him and his brother and his sister sharing an infested sofa cushion on the floor in his house.” Not able to believe the lack of support, even in a city such as Leeds with all its resources, Wilson decided to act. Her father had a van and a connection to a bed factory, so after consulting her headteacher and the pupil’s mother, she set off. “I honestly thought then that I’d go into this house and there would be a space in each bedroom where the beds should go, and that I’d feel like a super teacher for delivering these beds,” she said. “But when we went in the house to deliver the beds, the only thing in the house was one white plastic garden chair. There was no other furniture. I thought, they must have just moved in. But the mum explained that they had been there for months. “It was quite late when we got there. The mum got up on the white plastic chair and took the lightbulb out of the socket in the downstairs living room, and she went upstairs and put it in there because she only had one working light bulb.” The mother, a single parent, had been the victim of fraud and moved to an unfurnished house to save money. Wilson found there was no food in the house other than some milk. “I left absolutely shell-shocked, that a child I’d been teaching for weeks and known for a long time, that this was what he was living through. It changed the rest of my life.” A few weeks later the mother appeared at the school gates and pressed some cash into Wilson’s hand. “I said I don’t want paying back, and she said: ‘No, I’m giving you this so that you can buy them for some other families like mine.’” Wilson said she resisted the idea of starting a charity to provide beds. “I thought: there can’t be that many kids without beds, it’s 21st-century Britain. How bad can it be?” But previous research by the Buttle UK trust ranked Leeds as one of the worst areas for “bed poverty” in the UK, with more than 5,000 children in the city living without beds. A nagging feeling that something needed to be done led Wilson and some friends to set up Zarach, but they found themselves having to make difficult decisions: “There were many times when we were weighing up, well this child is sleeping in the bathtub or this child is sleeping on a beanbag, but we’d only got money to buy a bed for one.” While Wilson remains a committed full-time teacher and deputy head, support for Zarach has grown so that it can afford to pay a small number of staff and has expanded to offer food clubs, emergency gas and electricity supplies, a school uniform exchange and holiday projects. The Covid pandemic has led to an increase in demand, in particular from the number of families fleeing domestic abuse, according to Wilson. “I went to a house last week, there was no carpet, no furniture, no curtains on any windows, just nothing, a couple of bin liners of clothes, and that was it. But the parent was so happy – she said: ‘I feel like I’ve won the lottery, I’ve been living in a hotel for six months with three children in one room, because I fled domestic abuse, and I’ve just been given this house by the council in time for Christmas.’” While local authorities do their best, Wilson says they are overwhelmed by the demands they face. Zarach has now expanded outside Leeds, to Dewsbury in West Yorkshire and Romford in east London, where it hopes to apply the lessons Wilson and her colleagues have learned. Zarach, Wilson explains, is the Hebrew word for rising light, from a verse in the book of Isaiah that helping the hungry and oppressed rises a light in the darkness. The inspiration came from the first mother, who needed to move her only lightbulb for the bed delivery. “She said: ‘You were the light in my darkest day, and I’ll never forget that.’ And that’s what I wanted everything that Zarach did to try and be, to bring hope in desperate situations.”",News/Society,"‘I’m always tired, Miss’: the sleepless children of Leeds’ bed poverty crisis",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/02/leeds-bed-poverty-crisis-bex-wilson-zarach
