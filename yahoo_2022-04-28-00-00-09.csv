4/28/2022,"A “concerned citizen” is being credited in the rescue of a 5-year-old girl taken by her non-custodial mother across Pennsylvania state lines, Virginia police say. Inez Foulk went missing on Monday, April 25, from Polk Township when her grandmother said the girl’s mother fled with her as they were at a ShopRite Supermarket. The mother, Courtney Foulk, is only permitted to have supervised visits with Inez and is not allowed to be alone with her, according to Pennsylvania State Police. Troopers sent out a missing endangered person advisory for Inez and also released identifying information for the blue Chevy Lumina driven by her mother. A citizen traveling on Interstate 95 on Tuesday, April 26, saw the advisory and observed the vehicle disabled at an Exxon gas station in Caroline County, Virginia, state police said. The gas station is nearly 300 miles south of where Inez was last seen. The Caroline County Sheriff’s Office said the citizen called 911 and provided the license plate number of the vehicle, which was confirmed to be the one involved in the missing person advisory. Deputies responded to the gas station, where they safely rescued the child and arrested 37-year-old Courtney Foulk, the sheriff’s office said. It was a truck driver from New York who alerted deputies to the location of Inez, Caroline County Lt. Travis Nutter told WTVR. “When deputies searched the car they were in, they were unable to locate any clothes for the child or the mother,” Nutter told the station. “There was no food, no money for the mother to be able to purchase food and that sort of thing.” Caroline County Sheriff Tony Lippa said he is “thankful” for the citizen who alerted authorities when he saw the vehicle and the girl. “This citizen watched the vehicle and child, constantly providing information, until deputies could arrive and recover the child,” Lippa said. “I am also very thankful for the continued hard work and dedication of our Caroline County deputies. More than all, I am happy to report that the little girl in this case is safe.” Foulk will be extradited to Pennsylvania, state police said. Her charges have not been announced.

The acquisition comes after Musk’s longstanding gripes with what he deems a lack of free speech on Twitter, as the platform has been known to ban users who violate its terms of service. One celebrity in particular who was elated with the news is Ice Cube, who viewed Musk’s purchase as an opportunity to remove himself from the infamous “shadow ban” list. “Free at last! @elonmusic take off my shadow ban homie,” the veteran rapper, actor, and producer wrote on Twitter.

Over the years, though, panic about just how safe vaping actually is have made headlines time and time again. Back in 2019, the CDC clarified its stance on vaping. The agency admitted that bootleg THC products were likely to blame for vaping illnesses making headlines at the time. Now, though, the stance on vaping, or e-cigarettes, continues to be one of debate. A new study on how vaping affects the brain, lungs, and the rest of the body could shed more light on the subject.

The legendary Chom Chom Roller pet hair remover is down to just $25 Researchers published the new study in the journal eLife in early April of 2022. The researchers say that it’s the first study to assess how JUUL devices and their flavorings affect multiple organs in the body. The study was carried out by researchers at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine. “These pod-based e-cigarettes have only become popular in the last five or so years,” Laura Crotty Alexander, MD, and senior author of the study explained in a statement. Crotty Alexander says that currently, we don’t know much about their long-term effects on health. With over 12 million adults using e-cigarettes, learning more about how vaping affects the brain is more important than ever. The researchers say they focused on JUUL and its most popular flavors, mint and mango. To model the usage of e-cigarettes, they used young adult mice. They exposed the mice to the flavored JUUL three times a day for three months. Then they looked at the body for signs of inflammation. One of the most important effects they took note of were several inflammation markers in the brain. The researchers saw that several inflammatory markers in the brain had become elevated. Additionally, they noted that changes in the neuroinflammatory gene expression could be seen in the nucleus accumbens. This part of the brain is critical for motivation and processing rewards. The reason that the way vaping affects the brain is so notable is that this region has been linked to anxiety and depression. It has also been linked to addictive behavior. The researchers say this could further increase the amount of substance use as well as how addictive using the JUUL is. But the brain isn’t the only organ that vaping affects. The study also noted increased inflammatory gene expression in the colon. The heart, on the other hand, showed decreased levels of inflammatory markers. The researchers say this state of immunosuppression could make cardiac tissue more vulnerable. The researchers also found that the state of inflammatory response changes based if they change the flavor of JUUL, too. It’s an interesting look at how vaping affects the brain, as well as the other organs in the body. However, it’s still just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to truly understanding how our bodies might respond to those particular chemicals. Click here to read the full article.

4/28/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia and the United States have carried out an unexpected prisoner exchange in a time of high tensions, trading a Marine veteran jailed by Moscow for a convicted Russian drug trafficker serving a long prison sentence in America. The deal announced by both countries involving Trevor Reed, an American imprisoned for nearly three years, would have been a notable diplomatic maneuver even in times of peace. It was all the more surprising because it was done as Russia's war with Ukraine has driven relations with the U.S. to their lowest point in decades. The U.S., for its part, returned Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot who’d been serving a 20-year federal prison sentence in Connecticut for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the U.S. after he was arrested in Liberia in 2010 and extradited to the U.S. The Justice Department has described him as “an experienced international drug trafficker” who conspired to distribute thousands of kilograms of cocaine around the world. Despite Reed’s release, other Americans remain jailed in Russia, including WNBA star Brittney Griner and Michigan corporate security executive Paul Whelan. The exchange took place in Turkey, Reed's father, Joey Reed, told CNN. “The American plane pulled up next to the Russian plane and they walked both prisoners across at the same time, like you see in the movies,"" he said. The swap seemed unlikely to herald any larger breakthrough between Washington and Moscow. A senior Biden administration official cautioned that the negotiations centered on a “discrete set of prisoner issues” and did not represent a change to the U.S. government’s condemnation of Russia’s violence against Ukraine. “Where we can have discussions on issues of mutual interest we will try to talk to the Russians and have a constructive conversation without any way changing our approach to the appalling violence in Ukraine,"" the official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the administration. President Joe Biden, who met in Washington with Reed’s parents last month, trumpeted Reed’s release and noted without elaboration that “the negotiations that allowed us to bring Trevor home required difficult decisions that I do not take lightly.” The Russian foreign ministry described the exchange as the “result of a long negotiation process.” Reed, a 30-year-old former Marine from Texas, was arrested in the summer of 2019 after Russian authorities said he assaulted an officer while being driven by police to a police station following a night of heavy drinking. He was later sentenced to nine years in prison, though his family maintained his innocence and the U.S. government described him as unjustly detained and expressed concern about his declining health. A lawyer for Yaroshenko, who last year sought a reduced prison sentence because of Yaroshenko's vulnerability to COVID-19, did not immediately return an email seeking comment Wednesday. Russia had sought Yaroshenko's return for years while also rejecting entreaties by high-level U.S. officials to release Reed, who was approaching his 1,000th day in custody and whose health had recently been worsening, according to his family. A senior U.S. official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, described Reed's case as one of “utmost priority"" for the Biden administration. His family said Reed's poor health included symptoms of tuberculosis. “It was a difficult decision but one that we thought was worth it,” the official said. Though officials would not say where the transfer took place, in the hours before it happened commercial flight trackers identified a plane belonging to Russia’s federal security service as flying to Ankara, Turkey. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons also updated its website overnight to reflect that Yaroshenko was no longer in custody. Reed was en route back to the U.S., traveling with Roger Cartsens, the U.S. government's special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. “Today, our prayers have been answered and Trevor is on his way back safely to the United States,” Reed’s family said in a statement. The prisoner swap was the most prominent release during the Biden administration of an American deemed wrongly detained abroad and came even as families of detainees who have met over the last year with administration officials had described the officials as cool to the idea of an exchange. The U.S. government does not typically embrace such exchanges for fear that it might encourage foreign governments to take additional Americans as prisoners as a way to extract concessions and to avoid a potential false equivalency between an unjustly detained American — which U.S. officials believe Reed was — and a properly convicted criminal. In this case, though, the U.S. decided the deal made sense in part because Yaroshenko had already served a long portion of his prison sentence, which has now been commuted. The Reed family thanked Biden “for making the decision to bring Trevor home” as well as other administration officials and Bill Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who the family said traveled to Moscow in the hours before the Ukraine war began in hopes of securing Reed's release. The Reed family had also been working with a consultant, Jonathan Franks, who has been involved in other high-profile releases, such as the case of Michael White, a Navy veteran freed from Iran in 2020. Reed's release had no immediate impact on the cases of other Americans held by Russia. Griner, for one, was detained in February after Russian authorities said a search of her bag revealed a cannabis derivative. Whelan is being held on espionage-related charges his family says are bogus. U.S. officials have described Whelan as unjustly detained, and Biden said Wednesday “we won’t stop until Paul Whelan and others join Trevor in the loving arms of family and friends.” Reed's parents demonstrated outside the White House last month in hopes of getting a meeting with the president. “We believe that that meeting with the president is what made it happen” Joey Reed told CNN. “Which is what we had said all along — if we could just speak to the president, he's that kind of person.” When he is reunited with his son, the father said, “I want to hug him and not let him go.”",World/Associated Press,Russia releases US Marine vet as part of prisoner exchange,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-releases-us-marine-vet-113929166.html
