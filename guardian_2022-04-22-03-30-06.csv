4/22/2022,"News of numerous takeover approaches sounds thrilling but outside investors in THG, formerly The Hut Group, would be wise to contain their excitement. The online retailer’s share price had sunk so low that the company was being valued at half the level of its annual turnover, so it would almost have been odd if nobody wanted to have an exploratory poke around the aisles. Nor did THG say at what price the “indicative proposals” were pitched, only that the founder and chief executive, Matthew Moulding, and the board thought they failed to reflect “the fair value of the group”. The definition of a fair price in this context is anybody’s guess. THG floated at 500p in 2020 but, even after Thursday’s mini relief rally, now trades at 110p. No approaches remain on the table, the company added, so shareholders should probably assume that THG’s attempt at investment redemption will have to follow the harder road that involves grinding out the reliable numbers. On that score, Thursday’s report was mixed. Revenue guidance for 2022 – growth of 22-25% – is intact and, while pre-interest, pre-depreciation profit margins for 2021 were a bottom of the range 7.4%, they didn’t qualify as a miss. On the other hand, margins are probably going lower this year as input inflation hits in key areas of protein shakes and makeup. And true believers in the tale of building infrastructure to deliver abundant long-term growth still have to look past the operating losses (a thumping £137m last year). Then there is Moulding’s apparent obsession with corporate reinvention – the promised demerger of the Lookfantastic-based beauty division plus the Japanese group SoftBank option to buy 20% of the Ingenuity, the bit that provides “end-to-end technology services” to THG’s and other people’s brands. That agenda (plus Moulding’s hyperbolic utterances) is one of many factors that tends to baffle outsiders. Why does THG make the relatively simple business of selling stuff online sound so complicated? The arrival of Charles Allen as chairman is supposed to deliver governance reforms and greater clarity. Both are work in progress. The boardroom needs to be rinsed of Moulding’s former private equity fanclub, and THG needs to say out loud that the demerger plan has been dropped, rather than merely hint at a rethink. Meanwhile, an end to the tease with SoftBank, which surely isn’t going to exercise its Ingenuity option at the advertised (and out of date) $1.6bn price, would remove another distraction. Allen is fresh in post. The sooner he sets a new direction towards boring simplicity, the better. “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do?” runs the quote of disputed origin. In the case of Bill Ackman and Netflix, the answer is that the billionaire investor has learned to run for the hills. His Pershing Square fund, an off-shoot of which is a member of the FTSE 100 index, sold its entire 7% in the streaming firm on Wednesday at a loss of $400m only three months after buying it. Back in January, Ackman gushed about Netflix. The subscription model offered “highly recurring revenues, which have enormous future growth potential”. Management was “truly best in class”. The company enjoyed pricing power, an opportunity to increase profit margins and an “improving free cashflow profile”. Now he’s not so sure. Ackman supports the company’s response to weak subscriber numbers but reckons actions such as chasing non-paying customers and introducing a discounted option with adverts will make the business model harder to predict. Thus he’s out. He will look a fool if Netflix’s share price rallies after this week’s 40% plunge. But one can almost admire the willingness to cut losses. Ackman’s biggest disasters over the years – at the pharma group Valeant and via a short bet against Herbalife – involved hanging around too long. Investment mistakes, or doubts, are best admitted early. Elon Musk seems to have the financing in place for a $43bn offer for Twitter. The package includes putting up $21bn of his own money and raising $12.5bn of debt secured against his Tesla stake. As long as the equity portion is secure, and assuming Musk is prepared to brave the board’s devious “poison pill” tactics, it ought to be enough to launch a tender offer. The hardest part, though, is understanding why Twitter’s shareholders would want to accept an offer at $54.20 a share. The price was $70 as recently as last summer. Because it’s Musk, the narrative is all about one man’s ambition – but the takeover terms really aren’t compelling.",News/Business,Investors should take a cautious approach to THG takeover talk,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/apr/21/thg-takeover-talk-investors-retailer-online
4/22/2022,"Even at the moment of Borussia Dortmund’s greatest ecstasy, Hans-Joachim Watzke saw what was coming. It was May 2012 at the Olympiastadion in Berlin and Dortmund were blissfully tearing apart their rivals Bayern Munich 5-2 to seal their first league and cup double. Robert Lewandowski scored a scintillating hat-trick. Jürgen Klopp got so drunk during the celebrations that he later claimed to have no recollection of them. But their famously pessimistic chief executive was more worried about what might follow. “The echo,” Watzke told his colleagues, “will be dramatic.” A decade on, the echo is still reverberating. Even Watzke could scarcely have foreseen just how accurate his prediction would be. On Saturday, Bayern face Dortmund at the Allianz Arena. Win and they will clinch their 10th consecutive Bundesliga title. No other major European club can match that feat. Bayern’s humiliation, as it turned out, set off a reaction that would lead to them becoming not only the most dominant side in the history of German football, but one of the most dominant seen in the sport. Their combined margin of victory over the past 10 campaigns has been 137 points. They have beaten Dortmund in their past seven meetings in all competitions, another record. “Dortmund’s biggest mistake,” Watzke would later admit, “was to irritate FC Bayern too much in 2012.” For all the impressive feats and imposing numbers Bayern have accumulated over the past decade there is also a cold weirdness to their dominance, the sort of surrealness that arises when conventions have been bent and warped to the extent you are no longer really sure what they mean. On the one hand, winning 10 Bundesliga titles in a row is a genuinely staggering achievement. But the flip side of the argument goes: if a club can win 10 titles in a row, can it have been that hard to begin with? Even the Bayern coach, Julian Nagelsmann, occasionally senses that curious and restless feeling of ennui, often from within his own camp. This will be his first league title, a landmark for one of Europe’s most exciting young coaches. Thomas Müller, by contrast, is about to win his 11th. “I know that the league is a little bit less important in Munich,” Nagelsmann said on Thursday. “Still, it’s a very good achievement.” Beyond Bavaria, Bayern’s success often inspires much simpler feelings: from outrage to derision. To some, the case of Bayern is irrefutable evidence that football needs more protections against unfettered wealth. To others, it is irrefutable evidence of the opposite: that German football’s resistance to outsized investment, via its 50+1 ownership rule, has helped to entrench Bayern in their supremacy. The truth, as ever, is a good deal more complex. It’s easy to say Bayern winning 10 titles in a row is bad for the game. But then, how many is too many? What is the correct number of teams that should be allowed to hold sway over a league? Two, as in Spain and England? Three or four, as in Italy? Half of them? Ideally, should a different club be winning the title every season? Klopp addressed the issue in an interview with the German magazine Bild this month. “There are two reasons for Bayern’s dominance,” he said. “One, of course, is simply the quality they have. The other is that the pursuers steal points from each other. The other teams are probably too close.” What Klopp is saying, in essence, is the scrap to finish second – which in a typical year might involve Dortmund, RB Leipzig, Bayer Leverkusen and often an outsider or two – is so fierce and attritional that no one of them can sustain a genuine title challenge. The numbers tend to bear this out. On a simple points-per-game basis, Bayern are roughly on the same level as other title winners. Their form this season would translate to 91 points over 38 games. Manchester City are on course for 91, Real Madrid for 90, Paris Saint-Germain for 89. The big difference, however, is in the level of their competitors. Over the past five seasons, the average gap between the second- and fifth-placed teams in the Bundesliga has been 10 points. In England and Spain, the average gap is 17 points. In a way, Germany has traded an interesting title race for more and closer rivalries further down the league. The other point to make is that there are already early signs things may be changing. One of Bayern’s deadliest weapons in its search for domestic dominance has been its ability to pick off its rivals’ best players. A decade ago, it ransacked Dortmund for Lewandowski, Mario Götze and Mats Hummels. More recently, Marcel Sabitzer and Dayot Upamecano have been poached from the upstart RB Leipzig. But the influx of Premier League money has made it a tougher tactic to employ. Bayern are highly unlikely to challenge Europe’s giants for an Erling Haaland or a Jude Bellingham. Liverpool look better placed to sign the Leverkusen prodigy Florian Wirtz. Meanwhile, Bayern’s summer shopping list – which, according to various accounts, includes players such as Ajax’s Noussair Mazraoui and Antony, Benfica’s Darwin Núñez and the Leeds winger Raphinha – suggests Bayern are no longer shopping at the very top table. As Kai Havertz put it when spurning Bayern for the Premier League in 2020: “A title with Chelsea is worth a lot more.” Perhaps this is the logical upshot of essentially hobbling your own domestic league: it makes the whole much more vulnerable to predators. Already the great Lewandowski is stalling over a new contract, with Barcelona circling. The Champions League defeat to Villarreal demonstrated Bayern are no longer the team which once inspired fear across the continent. This month, the Bundesliga revealed its revenue had fallen 10% compared with the previous year, a product not just of empty stadiums but a decline in marketing rights as viewers begin to turn off the product. If Bayern’s rivals do not manage to put a dent in them, perhaps the market soon will.",Sport/Football,Bayern Munich poised for 10th title in a row but how many is too many?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/bayern-munich-bundesliga-10-titles-in-a-row
4/22/2022,"The former chief executive of a major foreign aid contractor has blasted police after being acquitted in a landmark foreign bribery case, saying its poor handling of the investigation was conducted with “little regard” for its “human, reputation, and financial cost”. In 2018, Australian federal police charged consulting firm Sinclair Knight Merz, a political donor and frequent contractor for the foreign affairs department, with bribing officials in south-east Asia to obtain work across almost a decade. The case alleged the company paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to officials in the Philippines and Vietnam governments between 2003 and 2012 to obtain work on development projects, often disguising them as “marketing” or other payments to third parties. The company, since acquired by Californian consulting giant Jacobs, pleaded guilty and was fined more than $1.4m in the New South Wales supreme court last year. The company’s former chief executive, Paul Dougas, and four other executives were also charged with engaging in a conspiracy to bribe officials, but took the case to trial last month. It was the first time a foreign bribery case had gone to trial. The case focused only on the allegations related to bribery in the Philippines. A jury took two days to acquit them and commonwealth prosecutors subsequently dropped plans for a second trial over the Vietnam bribery allegations. Suppression orders that had blocked reporting of details of the case were lifted this week. In a statement, Dougas said he was “relieved and grateful for the jury’s decision to acquit me and my former colleagues”. “The four years that this prosecution has taken have been exceptionally difficult, not only for me but also for my family, who have lived with the uncertainty that this prosecution cast over my professional standing and future,” he said. “Throughout my tenure as CEO of SKM, I endeavoured to lead a company that acted legally and ethically at all times, no matter where we were operating throughout the world.” Dougas said he felt the ordeal could “have been avoided if the AFP had properly and adequately investigated the matter for itself, instead of pursuing their case with little regard for the human, reputation and financial cost of doing so”. The firm conducted an internal investigation and self-reported the bribery allegations to the World Bank’s integrity arm in 2012. The AFP began investigating the allegations in July 2013, but did not bring charges until 2018. In sentencing SKM last year, the NSW supreme court said the delays “have not been adequately or satisfactorily explained”. The court found the offending was limited to one small part of the company and the “participants took great care to conceal their criminality from the wider company”. The AFP declined to comment. A Jacobs spokesperson has previously told the Guardian the activities took place well before it acquired SKM and in no way reflect the “ethical business standards and practices of Jacobs”.",News/Australia news,Former chief of foreign aid contractor acquitted of bribery blasts police over investigation,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/22/former-chief-of-foreign-aid-contractor-acquitted-of-bribery-blasts-police-over-investigation
4/22/2022,"Employers in New South Wales will still be able to require workers to be vaccinated against Covid-19 in high-risk settings, despite the removal of vaccine mandates, according to one of the nation’s leading health and safety lawyers. From 6pm on Friday, public health orders requiring key workplaces to be vaccinated will be lifted, and based instead on risk assessments under occupational workplace health and safety rules. Orders requiring aged care and disability workers to be vaccinated will remain in force, however. Michael Tooma, managing partner of law firm Clyde & Co described the move as a sensible next step in the management of the pandemic but said it wouldn’t mean the end of vaccination requirements in workplaces. “As we moved into the more normalised, living with the virus stage in the pandemic, this was always going to be something that was going to happen but really, it’s business as usual,” he said. “Vaccination will remain an effective control against the spread of the virus in workplaces where there is a higher risk of transmission.” Tooma said under workplace health and safety laws, employers have a duty of care to maintain a safe workplace for their employees as well as contractors, subcontractors and visitors. In terms of Covid-19, this obligation requires employers to take all reasonably practicable steps to minimise the risk of exposure to in the workplace. Employers are required to conduct a risk assessment, which factors in the nature of the workplace and the type of work being undertaken, and implement control measures to minimise risk. “For businesses that have a high customer interaction, businesses that have high density in their enclosed workplace or low ventilation, or businesses that have dealings with vulnerable communities – aged care, childcare and immune compromised people – maintained vaccination is one of the controls you would need to have,” Tooma said. He said vaccination was a “passive control” compared to measures such as social distancing, hygiene, cleaning and personal protective equipment. “The more passive the control the better, we say, because you’re not then relying on people remembering to do things or ensuring people are trained and instructed in certain procedures,” Tooma said. Several companies have already introduced workplace mandatory vaccination requirements, including Aldi, Coles, Commonwealth Bank, Qantas, SPC, Telstra, Virgin Australia, Westpac and Woolworths. A move by BHP to make Covid vaccinations mandatory at its Mt Arthur coalmine in the Hunter Valley was found to be unreasonable by the Fair Work Commission, however, as the mining giant failed to reasonably consult with its employees about the policy. Bernie Smith, the secretary for the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees’ Association, said the union was working with companies that have introduced their own vaccination requirements. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Our first preference was that our frontline workers have priority access, which would have probably minimised the need for mandates, but that’s not been the case across the board,” he said. “Then when it comes to mandates, our view is that it should be mandated by the government rather than by companies but we’ve had to deal with the fact that some companies have mandated and have the legal capacity to do that.” Smith said the union encouraged its members to follow the science, with vaccines providing the best protection from the virus. It comes as NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, encouraged unvaccinated teachers back into classrooms when the mandate ends. “I do want to encourage teachers [who left during the pandemic] to come back,” he told an estimates hearing on Thursday. “We put those mandates in place not to discriminate. We put those mandates in place to keep people safe. “Where we sit today, we’re in a very strong position to shift to more of an occupational health and safety approach.” However, Tooma said he expected vaccines would be required for teachers. “It comes down to the risk assessment. How many kids are in the classroom? How close are they to the teacher? Are the students vaccinated? Is there anyone immune compromised in the classroom, how about their family members?” he said. “In that environment a proper risk assessment is likely to result in vaccination being the appropriate control, but it’s a case by case. There might be a small school that has a small number of students and a large classroom and it’s not an issue but for most schools, it is likely to be.” Meanwhile, in Victoria, mandates will remain in place for the time being as authorities work with individual industries in the coming months to “transition” away from mandates. “Some industries will no doubt lift mandates and allow their workforces to attend work without a vaccination requirement, but some of them may well land on a policy that has an ongoing mandate but that should be worked out industry by industry,” the state’s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said in announcing the easing of restrictions on Wednesday. Australian Medical Association vice-president, Dr Chris Moy, said Victoria had likely chosen to maintain worker mandates to protect its struggling healthcare system and boost vaccination rates. “In health, you’d rather a government that somewhat over-corrects than make a reckless decision,” he said. “I think in Victoria they are really trying to push vaccinations because overall they are still concerned about making sure that they have a greater buffer if things get a bit hairier, coming into winter. And Victoria has gone through a lot more and is struggling with its health system.”",News/Australia news,"NSW employers can still require staff Covid jabs, despite end of most mandates, say workplace lawyers",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/22/nsw-employers-can-still-require-staff-covid-jabs-despite-end-of-most-mandates-say-workplace-lawyers
4/22/2022,"The Greens candidate for the seat of Griffith has threatened legal action against Brisbane city council for ordering his supporters to remove election signs from their front yards. The Brisbane council – Australia’s largest – introduced legislation last May capping election signs to 150 for each federal candidate and requiring residents to register their address with the council before erecting signs on their properties. The legislation, which reversed a 2015 easing of restrictions, also stated signs on private property could not be installed more than 28 days prior to the election and must be removed within seven days of the election. At the time, Brisbane’s lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, said the changes would “help reduce the wastefulness and the significant free-for-all and visual pollution across the city”. But the move was criticised by the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties for infringing on people’s political freedoms. Michael Cope, the president of the QCCL, said laws requiring “people to register with the council before they can … express a political opinion on their own private property is fundamentally repugnant to the whole concept of freedom of speech”. Max Chandler-Mather, the Greens candidate for Griffith, argues the law defines the election date as the opening of pre-polling, meaning signs could be erected from 11 April. However, authorities say the pre-polling reference does not apply to private property, and only to election signage on continuous signage devices, mobile vehicle election signs and election signs at pre-polling places. The threats of legal action meant people had been ordered to remove signs this week, which they would be able to return to their yards on Saturday. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Holland Park resident Claire Mitchell said she was “disappointed” to receive a letter on Wednesday, days after erecting a sign on her property promoting Chandler-Mather. “I was home yesterday and I noticed [council workers] walked over to my sign and took a photo of it … then they left a notice in my letterbox,” she said. “It said I need to urgently contact them in regard to removing the election sign.” Mitchell said she had seen election yard signs for different candidates up all around her area. And despite a warning from council, she was determined to keep her sign up, even if it meant incurring a penalty. “When I realised what was going on, I was really angry about it. I feel like it’s bullying and undemocratic,” she said. Another Brisbane Labor MP confirmed their office had also received requests to ask supporters to take down their signs. Chandler-Mather said the Greens were prepared to take council to court over the “draconian” directive. “I want to be very clear, we won’t be taking a single yard sign down,” Chandler-Mather said. “If they start issuing fines, that’s absolutely something we’ve already sought legal advice on and we’d pursue it as far as we possibly can. “And if that means going to court, then so be it.” Griffith, the former seat of then prime minister Kevin Rudd, is one of the Greens’ biggest targets at the May election. Chandler-Mather said laws restricting the number of yard signs unfairly targeted the Greens as a minor party which relied on significant organic community support to campaign.

4/22/2022,"Insurance industry files used to decide whether to give customers coverage and how much to charge are riddled with errors, according to new research. There was a material error in each of 15 “My Insurance Claim” reports examined by researchers for the Financial Rights Legal Centre, the advocacy service said. The FRLC said the reports, which currently cost $22 for consumers to obtain, should be free and the complicated process of applying for your file should be made simpler. It has called on the industry to clean up its act and for the federal government to intervene to improve customer access to their own data, which the researchers found was difficult to obtain even from your own insurance company. “I was gobsmacked at how bad the quality of the data and the process was,” Drew MacRae, a senior policy officer at FRLC, said. “Frankly I thought the insurance sector at its heart is about data, it’s about being able to calculate risk and it should be their bread and butter, so I was a bit surprised to see how poor the data standards were.” The Insurance Council of Australia provides the reports, which are supposed to summarise insurance information – including claims made, paid and denied – to insurers and consumers through a subsidiary called Insurance Reference Services. However, the FRLC’s researchers, Roger Clarke and Nigel Waters of Xamax Consultancy, found that errors in the reports included missing claims, the listing of additional claims that were never made and incorrect settlement and excess figures. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In addition, they said obtaining the report involved a multi-step process that involved filling out an insecure form in Microsoft Word format, which included text in four-point type and the Windings font used to display symbols, and emailing it back to a service provider. The researchers found that after sending off the form it usually took three to four days to receive the report, but sometimes took as long as a month. While privacy rules require companies to provide the information they hold on customers to them free of charge, the researchers found that actually getting the data was a difficult and bureaucratic process and produced inconsistent results. “Some of them we literally got … one line with three points of information,” MacRae said. “And then others, we’ve got 170 pages, a 10mb file full of screenshots that were unintelligible and unexplained. “In the data world, with insurance, you either get minimal information, like a skerrick of information, or you get a whole lot and you have no idea what to do with it. And I just think that needs to be sorted.” The findings should concern the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, which oversees privacy issues, as well as the insurance industry’s primary regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, he said. MacRae said the industry needed to act quickly because it will soon become subject to consumer data right rules, which are designed to give consumers more access to and control over personal information about them held by companies. The rules already operate in the banking and utilities sectors. “It really needs to be done in such a way that ensures people’s privacy is kept secure and that there are safety and security measures in place,” he said. An ICA spokesperson said the organisation welcomed the FRLC report and was already working on improving the IRS service. “IRS and its 16 insurer members are well advanced in a significant data improvement program in 2022 to address IRS data quality and consistency across the 16 insurers, that will address many of the points raised in the FRLC report,” the spokesperson said. “In addition to these issues of process, insurers see a significant need for engagement and policy deliberation around the proposed introduction of the consumer data right to general insurance. “While CDR may provide customers with greater control over their personal information it will also give insurers much greater line of sight on customer data.” Application times would be shorter under the CDR, the spokesperson said.",News/Business,"Australian insurance reports are riddled with errors and difficult to access, research finds",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/22/australian-insurance-reports-are-riddled-with-errors-and-difficult-to-access-research-finds
4/22/2022,"As the Coalition campaign seeks to revive the talking point that Labor always “takes China’s side”, Scott Morrison implored reporters to “just look at the record”. So we did just that and found the claims by the prime minister and his senior ministers are either factually inaccurate, misleading, or lack context. What I don’t understand is that when something of this significance takes place, why would you take China’s side? – Scott Morrison in response to Labor criticism over the security agreement between China and Solomon Islands, leaders’ debate, Wednesday Reality: Australia is a democracy. Questioning how the government has approached a challenging issue of foreign policy, and whether it could have done anything better to pursue Australia’s interests, is not taking China’s side. The Coalition and Labor have the same position on the major points of tensions in Australia’s relationship with China. When I called out China for where the pandemic started and said there had to be an independent investigation into the origins of Covid – apparently this was the wrong thing for us to do. Labor said that Australia was at fault in calling for that and our government was at fault for doing that. – Morrison, Thursday Reality: This is incorrect. Labor voiced support for such an international inquiry from the outset, with Albanese saying on 29 April 2020 that Australians “have an interest in finding out exactly the details of how this crisis came about, the source of the virus, how it happened … so that we can avoid it ever happening again”. Labor did criticise the government’s tactics though after the foreign minister, Marise Payne, first called for it in an interview on the ABC’s Insiders program. The shadow foreign minister, Penny Wong, said at the time it “would have been preferable” if the government had done more diplomatic legwork to lock in support from Australia’s close partners and allies before publicly announcing the call for an inquiry. Essentially, this amounted to a “safety in numbers” argument. When we shut the borders at the start of the pandemic, they accused me of being racist about that as well. No, I was protecting Australia.” – Morrison, leaders’ debate, Wednesday Reality: Albanese said on 14 April 2020: “We did shut down the border with China very early. That was a good decision and that made a big difference, no doubt.” Asked on 15 April 2020 whether the government had moved quickly enough to secure Australian borders, Albanese said: “Well certainly, the border closure with China was one of the successes.” When China were making decisions to apply trade sanctions and tariffs against Australia, Labor seemed to want us to reach a compromise with China rather than to stand up for Australia. When Anthony Albanese spoke at the National Press Club not that long ago, he actually suggested that we should negotiate or settle some of the points with China. – Finance minister Simon Birmingham, ABC TV, Thursday Reality: Actually, Albanese told the National Press Club on 25 January 2022 that Australia should “stand up for our values and we should be prepared to not compromise on them at all”. More likely Birmingham meant to refer to Albanese’s comments two days later, when the Labor leader said: “China should certainly withdraw some of the actions that have been taken to stop Australian products going to China.” The government has seized on the clumsy use of the word “some” to claim Labor is giving China a green light for some of the trade restrictions to remain in place. Albanese has said this misinterprets his comments, because he went on to call on Beijing to remove sanctions on Australian wine, other agricultural products and natural resources. Have they backed the Australian government in standing up for Australia, or have they run the talking points, have they run the lines of those who are seeking to criticise Australia for the important decisions that we’ve taken in our national interest? – Morrison, Thursday Reality: The truth is both major parties have been recalibrating their China policy over the past decade in response to what they see as a more assertive nation under Xi Jinping. Hence, on some issues there have been times when Labor has had a more hawkish position than the Coalition. Labor was early, for example, in opposing the extradition treaty with China at a time when it was official Coalition government policy (Coalition rebels were also influential in scuttling that deal). Wong coordinated with Payne’s office before meeting with the new Chinese ambassador earlier this year, in order to ensure Australia was sending a united bipartisan message to Beijing on key priorities. Consequently, Wong’s readout of her meeting was almost identical to the readout from Payne’s meeting from the previous week. There have been times, though, that Labor has accused Morrison of leaving a leadership void that was filled by outspoken Coalition backbenchers, and of lacking a cohesive strategy for dealing with a more assertive China. When they were last in office, [they] let our investment in our defence forces whittle away to the lowest levels as a share of the economy since 1938. And now we’ve restored that significantly, brought it back up to more than 2% of GDP. – Simon Birmingham, ABC TV, Thursday Reality: This is probably the government’s strongest line of attack against Labor on national security grounds. It is true, but lacks context. The Gillard government’s 2012 budget outlined plans to cut about $5.5bn from the defence portfolio, spread over four years. That was a time when Labor remained under significant political pressure to deliver promised budget surpluses, and months before Xi took power in Beijing. (Remember that two years later, Tony Abbott invited Xi to address the Australian parliament and feted him at a state dinner.) According to an analysis of official data compiled by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, annual defence spending as a share of the economy hovered between 1.7% and 1.8% of GDP during the life of the Howard government. Under the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments, it hit a peak of 1.96% in 2009-10 and a low of 1.59% in 2012-13. Under the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments it has steadily risen to be about 2% now – and will continue to increase. The Gillard government published a new defence white paper in 2013 that recommitted to increasing the defence budget to 2% of GDP as budget circumstances permitted. Albanese backed the Coalition’s 2020 defence strategic update which flagged $270bn of additional spending on defence capability over a decade, and he has pledged that if elected he will also spend at least 2% of GDP on defence.",News/Australia news,"Factcheck: the Coalition says Labor always ‘takes China’s side’, but are the parties’ positions so different?",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/22/factcheck-the-coalition-says-labor-always-takes-chinas-side-but-are-the-parties-positions-so-different
4/22/2022,"How do we capture something as complex and chaotic as becoming a mother? How do we survive it? In Mothertongues, acclaimed author Ceridwen Dovey and writer and actor Eliza Bell – both mothers – attempt to answer the question by way of a deconstructed, genre-bending collaboration. As Bell puts it in the intro: “As an artistic form, absurdism really captures something about motherhood.” The form of Mothertongues is striking. It sits somewhere at the intersection of experimental non-fiction and auto-fiction, borrowing liberally from other genres and forms to create a collective, meandering narrative about the early years of motherhood, when mothers are pushed to the boundaries of themselves again and again. Bell and Dovey weave together their reflections, using theatre, life-modelling, text messages, memoir and the hero’s journey as vessels for their experiences. It is an experiment in form (which Dovey, the author of Only the Animals and Blood Kin, is known for) that works in tandem with its topic: motherhood is lived in fragments, in bursts of clarity and in relentless, exhausting repetition. When it works, Mothertongues is a triumph, the abstract structure making space for the absurdity, wonder and grief of motherhood to step through into the body of the reader. It is immersive and thrilling in these moments, particularly as a mother – to feel surrounded and held in this way. But this free form occasionally becomes too loose, the bonds between the parts either sagging or feeling forced. Even this, though, is part of the experiment: not everything is expected to resonate. As Bell reflects early in the book, absurdist theatre doesn’t present us with a single satisfying narrative – but it can offer glimpses of insight: “When I watch these kinds of plays performed – the absurdist ones – sometimes I think, This is terrible! Even though I know the experience of confusion and frustration is very deliberate. But then, after a while, something pops – a poetic image that is briefly beautiful even if I don’t understand it.” There are plenty of these moments throughout Mothertongues – these briefly beautiful “pops”. The way in which Bell is introduced to the reader as a character onstage, posing as a life model for a room full of anonymous artists. The soundtrack released alongside the book, by Keppie Coutts, which offers moments of pause throughout. The oddly insightful/banal text messages between AI assistants Siri and Alexa: two absurd fictional characters whose friendship transcends months of no contact, and surreal non sequiturs. The tiny shards of domesticity – discarded lists, the contents of a handbag – that are at once insignificant and profound. There are plenty of the other moments too: the deliberately confusing or frustrating ones – scenes that hang in limbo, or tangents that stray a step too far. But these, too, say something about motherhood: the unfinished conversations; the standing in front of the fridge at midnight, wondering what you’re doing there. Not all mothers will see their struggles reflected here; the experience of motherhood becomes doubly complex among women of colour, queer mothers, disabled mothers, in ways that go largely unexamined. Mothertongues may have roots in memoir but it is also a collaborative and experimental narrative, making this oversight unfortunate and unnecessary – and preventing a broader scope that would truly speak to the communal experience. What may resonate more universally is the genuine friendship that so obviously exists between both writers, who refer to it in their individual acknowledgements and in the book itself. “Until you stepped into my life as a friend and muse – I hope it’s not too much for me to call you that – I would never have dared say a single thing about motherhood,” Dovey says at one point (although it could just as easily be Bell; their narratives aren’t always neatly distinct). “It felt like either it had all been said already, or that to say it truthfully would feel like a kind of self-murder.” Where parts of the book are flawed, or where the experiment doesn’t quite work, there is this vulnerability to keep it together. Even as they try on a myriad of forms, Bell and Dovey display a genuine commitment to exposing themselves as mothers. The rawness of these moments captures something fundamental about the way mothers look to each other to survive and understand their experiences. Motherhood can be luminous and infuriating. It can be deeply, intensely lonely. It can be a time of intense connection. It can be all of these things at once. Mothertongues is many things – an anthropological study, an artistic experiment – and most of all, a bold, exciting attempt to preserve the moments whose significance is fleeting and too often denied.",Arts/Books,Mothertongues by Ceridwen Dovey and Eliza Bell review – a bold experiment in form,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/22/mothertongues-by-ceridwen-dovey-and-eliza-bell-review-a-bold-experiment-in-form
4/22/2022,"More than 50,000 older Australians have died while on the waiting list for home care in recent years, data which Labor says shows the system is still in crisis. The federal government last year announced a major package to alleviate the pressure on home care and cut the number of people who have been approved for a home care package but are still waiting to receive it. Government data shows the time people spend on the waiting list, known as the National Priority System, is still significantly high despite substantial improvements in recent years. Those funded for the highest level of support are still waiting on average six to nine months for their approved package, down from 12 months or more in 2020. The data also shows that, despite the improvements, thousands of older Australians on the NPS are still dying before receiving their approved home care. In the last six months of 2021, 3,802 people on the NPS died before receiving the home care package they had been approved for. More than 8,000 died in the 2020-21 financial year, and 10,563 died in 2019-20. All up, more than 50,000 older Australians have died while waiting for home care since 2017-18. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning There is no suggestion the deaths were caused by the delays to home care and the government says it would be misleading to draw any causal link. Senior health officials also say the number of deaths is proportionate to the general rate of deaths in the community for older age cohorts. But Labor’s Mark Butler said the delays, which he described as a “tragedy” and a “national disgrace”, showed continuing problems in the wait to access home care. “Most Australians want to age in their own home but the system that’s supposed to help them do that is in crisis,” he said. “There are still tens of thousands of older Australians waiting for Home Care Packages. 50,000 have died waiting since July 2017.” “This is a national disgrace.” A spokesperson for Colbeck said it would be misleading to suggest the deaths occurred “as a result of having to wait for a home care package”. “As Department of Health secretary Prof Brendan Murphy noted during Senate estimates, the number of people over the age of 75 who have died while on the waiting list for a home care package is exactly the same proportion of people who have died in that aged bracket in the general community,” the spokesperson said. “Importantly, the National Prioritisation System didn’t even exist under the last Labor government.” The Coalition has accused Labor of announcing nothing on home care, while pointing to its own funding of 80,000 home care packages in the last budget. The new packages are coming online progressively until 2023 and are helping to reduce the waiting list. But while the funding is largely welcomed by the sector, peak bodies have repeatedly warned that a significant staffing crisis is hampering the actual delivery of funded services. Leading Age Services Australia on Wednesday questioned a claim by the government that the workforce had in fact grown by almost 15% in five months. That claim was at odds with the severe staffing shortages LASA’s members were reporting. “We are not aware of any data that reflects this level of growth in the home care workforce,” its chief executive, Sean Rooney, told the Guardian. The largest home care provider, myHomecare Group, said its staff were at breaking point and that the Coalition’s $800 staff bonus was doing nothing to alleviate the crisis.",News/Australia news,"More than 50,000 older Australians died while waiting for approved home care since 2017, data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/22/more-than-50000-older-australians-died-while-waiting-for-approved-home-care-since-2017-data-shows
4/22/2022,"Just two of the 23 recommendations handed to the New South Wales government after an inquiry into kangaroo population levels and culling practices have been accepted in full. Inquiry chair and Greens MP Cate Faehrmann said the response was “dismissive of the serious issues raised” during the three-day inquiry called to understand the wellbeing of the state’s kangaroo population, amid concerns about the scale and regulation of culling. Leading kangaroo scientists have backed the government’s reply as fair, given the inquiry’s limited remit, but said much more work was required to develop cohesive policy for macropod populations. George Wilson, a leading researcher and ANU science professor said both the inquiry and government kangaroo policy generally left many areas “completely under-addressed” and called for an end to “short-termism”. “We don’t even know if we want more kangaroos or less kangaroos. How can you have a management plan if you can answer that question?” Wilson said. Last year’s inquiry received more than 400 submissions, hearing from experts and the public over three days before handing down a raft of recommendations including greater transparency in licensing and regulation of the industry. The inquiry also called for the establishment of an independent panel of ecologists to examine the scientific evidence for assumptions used in the state’s kangaroo management plan. In its repose, the government agreed to produce and publish “plain English” explanations of its planning and methodology around kangaroo harvesting and consult with and include Indigenous perspectives. It did not support a number of the recommendations including getting the auditor general to review the kangaroo management plan, the introduction of video monitoring for kangaroo populations, and the collection and publishing of data around joeys orphaned due to culling. According to 2021 government data, the estimated kangaroo population in management zones in NSW was 10.9 million kangaroos, up from 10.5 million the previous year. Faehrmann said she was disappointed the government had ignored recommendations for the Natural Resources Commission to have a role in reviewing the methodology used to estimate kangaroo numbers, and for more research into the potential impacts of climate heating on macropod populations. “For the government to dismiss all of this outright suggests that they aren’t concerned about the sustainability of their kangaroo management program whatsoever,” she said. Wilson said there needed to be greater engagement with graziers given the number of kangaroos living and being harvested on privately managed properties. “[Farmers] have got two mechanisms to manage –they can get a professional kangaroo shooter in or they can fence their properties off. This is really not the way forward – we need to have a good hard look at this,” he said. “We need to get all the stakeholders around the table. We all need to discuss what it is we’re trying to achieve, and then set up a pathway to achieving that.” Michael Archer, a UNSW biological science professor agreed that the government’s response was reasonable but that the inquiry and current government management plans needed to take into consideration graziers’ role in population control and habitat management. “I’d like to see some encouragement from the government to explore issues with the industry about some percentage of the income that’s derived [from kangaroo harvesting] being returned to the grazier in exchange for guaranteeing the maintenance of the habitat,” he said. “As soon as that begins to happen then we’re going to see a massive reduction in the amount of land clearance that goes on.” A NSW government spokesperson said the government’s response had been developed by the Department of Planning and Environment.",News/Australia news,NSW government criticised for ‘dismissive’ response to inquiry into kangaroo population,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/22/nsw-government-criticised-for-dismissive-response-to-inquiry-into-kangaroo-population
4/22/2022,"More than 15% of the Melbourne international comedy festival’s shows have been hit by Covid-related cancellations, prompting some independent artists to urge the state government to boost its arts funding ahead of next month’s state budget. Despite the festival helping boost pedestrian traffic in the CBD to pre-pandemic levels, 17% of the 505 scheduled shows were forced to cancel some performances due to Covid or isolation as a close contact. Throughout the festival, which ends on Sunday, 5% of individual performances were cancelled due to Covid. The Gold Coast-based performer Clara Cupcakes travelled to Melbourne for the festival but was only able to perform eight of her 14 scheduled performances after she caught the virus. “It halved my income and while I was able to get the pandemic disaster income, it really doesn’t touch what could have been my potential earnings,” she said. She urged the state government to consider an add-on arts payment that would support performers. “There needs to be some acknowledgement of the gig economy because the sector generates so much money for the economy and people take a huge gamble to put on entertainment for people.” The Melbourne-based comedian Sashi Perera was forced to cancel half of her 12 scheduled performances after her performing partner caught the virus. “There are so many fixed costs because you’re still paying for the venue for two weeks even though you’re just using it for one week. We’ll be lucky to break even,” she said. “There’s not just the financial implications but you also lose out on word of mouth opportunities to spread around and you’re not eligible for awards, plus you miss out on review opportunities.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Simone Pulga, the director of Melbourne venue The Butterfly Club, said the financial impact of cancelled shows for him was minimal compared to artists. The Butterly Club is an independent or satellite venue, meaning it is not managed by the festival. “The real losers here are the artists. As a venue, we are in the privileged position where we can reschedule slots. But there is an increased administrative cost,” he said. “For the artist who works to put something on and then loses shows, it’s catastrophic. Because it’s seasonal, cancellations can be career-defyingly bad. The human impact for the artist is huge.” Of the 250 performances scheduled at the venue, 39 – or 15% of the original program – were cancelled due to Covid. But Pulga said the venue was often able to find other performers to fill the cancelled slots.

Designed to give certainty for event organisers, it provides a 100% payout if a cancellation occurs due to a state or commonwealth public health order such as a lockdown. Pulga said the state’s event insurance scheme was “useless” in these circumstances because it did not cover artists for when they got Covid. “The fact it only covers for lockdowns at the same time the state government says there will be no more lockdowns means it fails in these situations,” he said. Evelyn Richardson, the chief executive of Live Performance Australia, said the arts sector was undergoing a “messy transition” as Covid restrictions were relaxed. “We’re not sure what will come our way and history tells us we always have to prepare and have contingency plans,” she said. A Victorian government spokesperson said the state had invested more than $1bn throughout the pandemic to support performers, practitioners and arts businesses. “We understand the frustration of cancelled shows. The best way to guard against infection is by getting vaccinated, but the reality is sometimes that won’t be enough.” Susan Provan, the Melbourne international comedy festival director, said it was working with government to determine what support would be needed in the future. “The government support we’ve received this year has assisted us with significant digital marketing campaigns to build audience confidence and visitation, encouraging people out and back to live events,” she said. The Melbourne lord mayor, Sally Capp, said the festival had boosted foot traffic in the Melbourne CBD to above pre-pandemic levels on the weekend and between 80-95% of the benchmark on weekdays. “The city is absolutely buzzing, with laughter and cheer spilling out of the festival venues and into our streets, shops, restaurants and bars,” she said. Capp said the festival’s success had given Melburnians the confidence that the city was “open for good”.",News/Australia news,Covid disrupts Melbourne comedy festival as calls grow for arts support,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/22/covid-disrupts-melbourne-comedy-festival-as-calls-grow-for-arts-support
4/22/2022,"Health experts are pleading with both sides of politics to commit to increased funding for GPs after figures reveal lower income areas are among those most disadvantaged by the Medicare gap. In the face of doctor shortages and rising patient fees, new data reveals some of the most disadvantaged electorates have among the highest average out-of-pocket costs for a consultation. Medicare funds a rebate of $39.10 for a standard consultation, however aside from indexation rises, this amount has been frozen since 2013, with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) warning that a disconnect between the rebate and real cost of delivering services is forcing GPs to either increase out-of-pocket costs for patients or, increasingly, shut down entirely. Moreover, the RACGP and other industry experts are concerned that unless the government overhauls how GPs are funded, increasing numbers of medical graduates will opt for a career in higher earning specialties, which in turn would worsen health outcomes for lower income earners who could not afford rising out-of-pocket costs. Commonwealth data broken down by electorate shows that the average out-of-pocket costs for a GP consult range from $27.11, in the South Australian seat of Spence, to $52.05 in Wentworth, home to some of Sydney’s wealthiest suburbs in the city’s east. Several inner city and suburban seats such as Melbourne’s Higgins and Macnamara – third and fourth most expensive at $50.65 and $50.29 – as well as Sydney – the fifth most expensive at $49.55 – also feature as some of the most expensive electorates for out-of-pocket costs. However, out-of-pocket costs in the Northern Territory are among the most expensive in the country, with Solomon – the electorate that is home to Darwin – recording the second highest average out-of-pocket costs in Australia, at $50.78, while Lingiari, which takes in the remainder of the territory, is the 14th most expensive, at $45.61. Both Solomon and Lingiari are marginal seats, held by Labor at 3.1% and 5.5% respectively. The marginal north-western Sydney seat of Greenway, which Labor MP Michelle Rowland holds by 2.8%, has the 20th highest average out-of-pocket cost for a GP visit, at $45.17, while in Queensland, the seat of Groom, which takes in Toowoomba, ranks 18th highest, with an average cost of $45.36. Dr Karen Price, the RACGP president, wants the Coalition and Labor to commit to better funding GPs in line with the rising costs, and is keen for voters to understand the associated impact on health outcomes for Australians. She said it was proven “time and time again” that investments in primary care lead to a greater saving for the government in hospital costs, by treating before conditions escalate. Price acknowledged a government figure that about 89% of GP services were bulk-billed – but said this did not mean that 89% of patients were not paying for their doctor visits, rather, that a visit that included a consult and having something removed registers as two services. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We think the number of Australians who don’t pay anything for their GP visits is between 67% and 70%.” Price was alarmed at some of the higher average out-of-pocket costs in poorer areas. “If you’re in an area where there’s no other doctor and you’ve got a six-week wait for a bulk-billed appointment, they can charge more,” she said. “But the vulnerable people in those electorates are not going to access it. “Most of the healthcare people need is related to their postcode and their socio-economic status. It’s often those who need the most care that are least able to pay for it.” Price said higher out-of-pocket costs in regional areas came at a time when it was tough to attract GPs trained in cities to relocate for work. Even in cities, Price said, current Medicare funding levels were turning graduates away from general practice. “We know that only 15% of medical graduates are looking to enter general practice, which is down from 50%. When you’ve got kids and Hecs debt after a long course, it can be more attractive to stay in a hospital job with leave and other entitlements, rather than become a GP.” Price noted that the Australian Medical Association recommends GPs charge $86 for a standard consult, and that if they don’t charge this, “they’re basically discounting their work”.

We have an ageing population, and mental health and complex chronic conditions are more common. They require consultations but are not valued by Medicare in the same way. You’ll earn more if you see three patients in the time it takes for an extended appointment for one patient,” Price said. Additionally, Price pointed to the increased cost of paying staff, acquiring and maintaining new computers and technologies used to treat patients, and the price of PPE that soared during the pandemic, as reasons why some GPs were forced to increase their out-of-pocket costs. Dr Stephen Duckett, a Grattan Institute health economist and former secretary of what is now the Department of Health, echoed Price’s concerns that general practice was underfunded and graduates were turning away from the career, but said “the right answer may not be by increasing the rebate”. “We want to reshape the way primary medical care works … so exploring funding that increases the incentive for continuity, to reward GPs for building a relationship with patients, which can allow them to be more proactive in their care with things such as phone checkups. “You’ve got to invest more money in general practice. And we can’t ignore that if you’re leaving medical school today, the choice between being a GP and a cardiologist is five times as much money, so we have to start addressing that,” Duckett said. The opposition health spokesperson, Mark Butler, did not directly answer if Labor would increase the Medicare rebate, but said “Labor will always strengthen and protect Medicare, we’ll have more to say during the campaign”. “Under Scott Morrison it’s never been harder or more expensive to see a GP. “We know that when people can’t afford to see the GP they either end up in overwhelmed emergency departments or just put off getting the healthcare they need,” Butler said, also pointing out Labor’s urgent care clinic commitment. Guardian Australia asked Greg Hunt, the outgoing health minister, if the Morrison government planned to increase the Medicare rebate. A spokesperson did not answer directly, but referred Guardian Australia to the figure that 89% of GP services are bulk-billed, and said that “the Morrison government is committed to not just supporting GPs, but also supporting their patients”. “In terms of funding, Medicare was $19bn under Labor and is $31bn this year growing to almost $36bn over the forward estimates,” the spokesperson said.",News/Australia news,Calls for GP funding boost as figures reveal how Medicare gap hits some of Australia’s poorest areas,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/22/calls-for-gp-funding-boost-as-figures-reveal-how-medicare-gap-hits-some-of-australias-poorest-areas
4/22/2022,"I never imagined that an interstate trip could be so exciting. But when your world shrinks the way it has since the pandemic hit Australia two-and-a-bit years ago, and then slowly expands, only to contract and gradually open up yet again, the most prosaic experience attains new meaning. And so it was with my first flight in more than two years. There was the airport. Airports have been a mainstay of my life since I was in my mid-20s (that’s a long time); always departing and arriving, often weekly, sometimes melancholy at leaving little kids behind, other times elated or excited, and sometimes afraid of the unknown upon arrival. I’d forgotten how it felt to be amid that mad bustle of people coming and going. The atmosphere freighted with the anticipation of love or conflict, duty maybe – or just out-and-out fun. Obligations. Reunions. Goodbyes. The air was palpable with it all on Good Friday. I’m an early-to-the-airport person (thanks Dad – although, unlike you, I don’t wear a tie when flying) so two hours before boarding to negotiate a seriously undermanned and overstretched Sydney Airport was no chore. Time for the bar and, of course, people-watching. That woman with the New Yorker tote-bag? Between alternate gentle laughter, scowls and shakes of her head she wrote furiously on her laptop and into a Moleskine notebook. Play? Short story? Novel? That group of young Arab men and women laughing and posing for photographs by the expansive windows, aircraft in the background, lighting up the place with their infectious happiness. The man in the corner drinking three to everyone’s one. Alone. Brooding. Dutch courage for a showdown? Or fearful flyer? Another one of the 70,000 stories who passed through the airport that day. I’ve never exactly been a chilled flyer. But when the plane took off I was hypervigilant and excited, thrilling in that moment of exquisite weightlessness as the wheels departed Earth, leaning across my partner towards the window to watch everything below miniaturise. I felt seven years old again. And I experienced that déjà vu sense of ambiguous possibility I’d always had, fleetingly, all those thousands of times I’d flown … until two-and-a-bit years ago. During lockdowns I’ve been in the privileged position of being able to embrace the shrunken pandemic world. My routine revolved around my neighbourhood, my dogs, my immediate family, my kitchen and my desk. The extraction of everything extraneous (socially, professionally, recreationally) from life was at once a liberation and an incarceration. Mundanity has its own hypnotic rhythm, of course, and one thing I learned about myself during lockdown (something I’d long suspected) was how very comfortable I’d become in recent years with a minimal external – and conversely vivid internal – life. The other thing about pandemic life, of course, is that it is the ultimate enemy of the well-laid plan. Like everyone, Covid-19 had scuttled numerous holidays, birthday celebrations, day trips and get-togethers. When, some weeks ago, we booked to fly last Friday, I never actually expected it to happen. Perhaps that’s why, with wheels-up, I felt more consumed by a moment than I have for some time. The city we visited – the last place I flew to before the pandemic and where I’ve been dozens of times – seemed, if not quite exotic, remarkably compelling. Is it possible that the denial of so much during the pandemic lockdown (Melbourne people are the experts on such advice) had added new allure to what was formerly the prosaic. I think so. The restaurant meal, the plane ride, the hotel stay, the social occasion all now come with a joy that might previously have been a certain nonchalance or even weariness. Last June, just weeks ahead of the long Sydney lockdown that would soon follow, a dear friend held a big birthday bash. It was no special number as big birthdays go (though it could be said that every one beginning with a “6” is momentous). But our friend wanted a party after the preceding 18 months of pandemic fear and loathing, there was a brief unlocked opportunity and, besides, he wanted to get drunk and karaoke that Beatles song about a significant birthday. It may as well have been an Oscars after-party for the vibe and cut-loose fun that was had. The experience resonated joyfully through some of the darkest months of lockdown that followed. Notwithstanding the (increasingly hidden) economic and physical suffering, (and continuing) fear, illness and deaths that the raging pandemic still holds, it remains a bright, warm memorial light. That’s what happens when everything old is new again, when simplicity spawns a new virtue. So much so that, on the return flight last Sunday, I became that person who feverishly takes bad photographs of the harbour from the plane window.",Opinion/Opinion,"I never imagine flying could be so exciting, but everything old is new again | Paul Daley",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/22/i-never-imagine-flying-could-be-so-exciting-but-everything-old-is-new-again

4/22/2022,"“I won’t be leading in with singles,” Daniel Johns declared when announcing FutureNever, his second solo release. “The album is designed to be enjoyed as an album.” It’s a romantic notion, in a world where playlists are populated by robots, but the album’s cyberpunk artwork and dystopian title meshes nicely with Johns’ conceptual thesis: “‘FutureNever’ is a place where your past, present and future collide – in the ‘FutureNever’ the quantum of your past experiences become your superpower.” Despite the sci-fi wrapping, FutureNever clearly wasn’t conceived as a united body of work. Johns calls it “an eclectic mix of music that I’ve made over the last couple of years” and this haphazard nature looms large, despite attempts to tie a neat bow around it all. Within the first 10 minutes, FutureNever erupts with Diorama-level theatrics, busts into a perfectly paced day-glo RnB gem, then comes down hard with a Peking Duk collaboration about cocaine. FutureNever feels like a number of separate projects played on shuffle. There are four songs that seem like offcuts from an aborted operetta, a few dance collaborations that belong on Ministry of Sound mixes, and a handful of tracks that split the difference between the slinky electro of his debut solo album, Talk, and his bright and loopy Dissociatives work with Paul Mac. There’s also a lot more guitar shredding than expected, despite this being very much not a guitar record. It’s shocking Johns released this in the traditional album format at all, considering the sonic dissonance. As a statement of intent, it is inscrutable. As a concept album, it seems suspiciously reverse-engineered. Which is only to say that FutureNever makes for an uneven album. As a collection of music, it is unassailable, ambitious, and often brilliant, with the album’s high points sitting among his very best work. FutureNever begins and ends with the same piano run, a stab at cohesion furthered by Johns’ decision to bookend the record with the two most bombastic songs of his career, both of which would have been at home on the Dracula puppet musical. Johns’ grander orchestral ambitions are pushed to 11 on opener Reclaim Your Heart; his full-throated vocal is so rich and completely over the top, pushed so high in the mix, that it feels uncomfortably intimate at times, sliding towards histrionics while somehow still feeling sincere. It’s a high-wire act and he only occasionally slips. Likewise, closing track Those Thieving Birds Pt. 3 completes the Young Modern trilogy of whimsical, twerping tunes, but with far more weight. When We Take Over, another treacly tune, sounds like an open-call audition for a Broadway musical. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Johns delayed the album’s release by three weeks in order to include a collaboration with Van Dyke Parks that needed more work; a wise move, as Emergency Calls Only is the record’s high-water mark, both musically and emotionally. It is a stunning pocket symphony, in the vein of Silverchair songs Tuna in the Brine and Across the Night. The exercises in genre-hopping throughout FutureNever are mostly successful. I Feel Electric sounds like pristine Off the Wall-era Michael Jackson. Somebody Call An Ambulance benefits from its late-run sequencing, bursting through like a sun ray and finding the ghost of Luke Steele still lurking in Johns’ songwriting years after their fruitful collaborations. D4NGRSBOY has hooks for days. FreakNever is the track that will elicit the most discussion and disagreement among fans. An emotional recasting of Silverchair’s 1997 single Freak, Johns pens third-person lyrics to his hit single, looking back at the earth-shaking trauma of his teenage fame. Relative unknown Purplegirl sings his biography to devastating effect: “No more maybes, the world stole a baby, took his soul on tour, and made a deal with the devil.” It’s heartbreaking and creepy, The Exorcist as told by TikTok.

Resignation would have to follow. Beyond that, he has the May elections and further penalty notices ahead. Even his talents as a political Houdini will be tested. The issue is not what he did. No one doubts that there were rule-breaking gatherings in Downing Street during coronavirus restrictions. Proof enough lay in the resignations that followed their disclosure. In December last year, Sue Gray was asked, quite unnecessarily, to see whether they were true. The Metropolitan police then did likewise, proceeding with inexcusable delay, as if the culprits were an elusive and secretive mafia. This favoured Boris Johnson’s strategy of playing bad news long, hoping for luck and events to postpone any day of judgment. The home secretary, Priti Patel, should have ordered the police to resolve this matter immediately months ago. It is suspicious that she did not. I at first assumed that Johnson’s lifelong tactics would see him through. He would fumble and lie and delay. He has duly used the Met’s dilatoriness to silence Gray and consign her to history. He has fled the scene to Ukraine and now taken refuge in a JCB factory in India. He has invoked the aid of Vladimir Putin, the cost of living crisis and the virtues of political continuity. He ordered his MPs to stall a vote to refer him to the privileges committee, in what appeared to be a tacit acceptance of guilt, but that transparent delaying tactic quickly fell apart in the face of accusations of a cover-up. Tory whips withdrew their blocking amendment, allowing the Labour motion to pass and the examination of Johnson’s actions by the privileges committee to proceed. Politicians lie to the Commons all the time, but with a subtlety that eludes Johnson. If he was innocent, he would have referred himself to the committee. This is not over. If one fixed-penalty notice can yield the past week’s pandemonium, what of the next multiple notices, all reputedly more serious? There is no question of guilt, only of punishment. In the middle ages, political executions were preceded by a prolonged ritual of hanging, drawing and quartering. Death was postponed amid screams of pain to enlighten and entertain the populace. Today’s torture is psychological, leaving Johnson’s face pallid with daily torment. Keir Starmer can barely suppress his glee. The Labour leader works himself into a froth, his vitriol sprayed over Johnson beyond that of any opposition leader in my memory. But then, Starmer cannot really want Johnson to resign. He would be mortified to lose such a heaven-sent target before the next election. Rishi Sunak would make a hopeless victim of his abuse. Tory MPs are so far more opaque, though bellwether Steve Baker has made his feelings known. Local elections in Britain have become opinion polls rather than expressions of lower-tier democracy. Those forthcoming in May are Johnson’s next day of reckoning. Even assuming Johnson evades an adverse judgment from the privileges committee, his colleagues seem increasingly likely to realise that they are going to need a new leader, and soon, but preferably not until a plausible alternative is on offer. They appear ready for the time being to play along with Johnson’s can-kicking buffoonery, but their humiliation before the electorate can go on only so long. Polls suggest two-thirds of the public want him to go if fined again. The country at large must now accept that the future of the government depends on an indefinite series of fixed-penalty notices, as ordained by a currently leaderless London police force. This is, of course, democracy. The US’s leadership once hung on an act of fellatio. But the question remains open as to how Britain should be led through a period of acute strain infecting all areas of the state. The prime minister has no programme, no strategy, no professed ideology: only a frantic search for survival. In a revealing aside last Tuesday, Johnson argued that this was demanded by circumstance. Whenever challenged, he refers to the war in Ukraine, as if this was Britain’s business. A war is handy for any prime minister. Thatcher’s leadership in 1982 was rescued by the Falklands war. David Cameron wanted to go to war in Syria and went to war in Libya. But these prime ministers were conducting or proposing conflicts on their country’s behalf. Ukraine is not Britain’s war, thank goodness. It may be that Johnson would dearly love to swap places with Volodymyr Zelenskiy. But it is outrageous that he feels he can periodically lecture him on what he should or should not concede to Russia. That is not Johnson’s business, any more than underpinning his leadership struggle is Zelenskiy’s. In fact, Johnson’s most distinctive contribution to Ukraine’s plight has been to deny an open door to Ukrainian refugees, leaving in place the Home Office’s “hostile environment” to all European migrants. Nothing must breach Brexit’s aversion to foreigners, however desperate their plight. Yet, as Johnson turns away the refugees, he could fly for a picture opportunity with Zelenskiy in Kyiv. Even Emmanuel Macron did not descend to such a stunt. That stable leadership is advisable when the economy is in trouble is beyond argument. But Johnson is not in control. He leaves Downing Street almost daily to wander the country in a desperate search for photo opportunities for the evening news. He deports asylum seekers and reverses energy policy. He attacks the archbishop of Canterbury. Every utterance drips with self-righteousness. The British economy currently rests in the hands of Rishi Sunak. His inexperience has led him to make mistakes, but he is a competent chancellor facing the toughest challenge in a generation and needing constant support. He did not deserve to be paraded as Johnson’s accomplice in the last fixed-penalty ritual. The last thing he now needs is a boss teetering almost daily on the edge of downfall. The security of any prime minister should not turn on a random mistake or misdemeanour. Downing Street is a job under phenomenal pressure, besieged by a catalogue of accidents and errors, not all of the prime minister’s making. Over Partygate there was some justice in Johnson’s plea that its criminality did not merit the penalty of resignation. But that excuse needed to be deployed instantly and sincerely in a burst of confession and apology. Johnson’s error was not to do that. Denial was buried deep in his narcissism. He fell back on a conviction that he could bluff and squirm his way through what should have been a passing crisis. In doing so he has subjected his country to a distasteful farce that has lasted six months and is not yet over. It is that farce that has deflected attention from Ukraine, the economy and the cost of living. Partygate has thus confirmed the view that Johnson was never fit for the office he holds. At an appropriate moment his friends should advise him not to seek re-election, but simply resign. Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,Boris Johnson’s guilt is beyond doubt.

4/22/2022,"Gordon Glassford (Letters, 16 April) needs “tae think again” about Flower of Scotland. It is no surprise that the brutal savagery visited on the Scottish in the past should have left an anti-English legacy. The recent renewed focus on slavery shows that we cannot just forget the past and its impact. Looking back is essential to looking forward in the most constructive way. It is absurd to reduce Scottish nationalism to anti-English sentiment. The Scottish have a history, culture, language and identity that they quite reasonably wish to be enshrined in independence. The imposition of Brexit on Scotland against its will is just the latest example of English arrogance and indifference to Scottish interests. But “we can still rise now and be [a] nation again”.Nigel FlorenceMevagissey, Cornwall  A national anthem does not need words. I’ve always thought that a fitting anthem for an independent Scotland would be the wonderful theme from the final movement of Mendelssohn’s Symphony No 3 (the “Scottish”). Stirring, romantic and not encumbered by any embarrassing or clumsy declarations. And the work of a German Jew.

4/22/2022,"The Salvation Army has been accused of acting like “a rogue landlord” by leaving some of its private residential tenants in Hadleigh, Essex, exposed to “serious” hazards for at least seven years. Some of the charity’s tenants tell their stories here: Peggy Jane Smith, 58, has lived in a first-floor two-bedroom Salvation Army maisonette since 1983. When she first started renting the property, it felt like a return to her roots: she was born in a house nearby and her first trip outdoors was when her mother walked her to the ruins of Hadleigh castle. “When I first moved in here, I was so grateful to have this place. I felt so lucky. And part of that feeling was, I thought to myself, I’ve got the Salvation Army as a landlord,” she said. “Perfect, perfect. I thought, there won’t be any bad treatment here.” But she has now been complaining about the condition of her home for the best part of a decade. One complaint related to an infestation of rats in the property below. “I was told by the estate manager at the time, there were no rats. There was evidently rats,” she said. “There have been floods. I’ve had no heating. I’ve had no water. There’s [the Salvation Army’s] treatment as well … they will ignore me … that is their way of treating me, ignoring me or showing contempt when they do talk to me.” The most serious problem with Smith’s home is the fire risk, with an unsafe kitchen and very little to prevent any fire from spreading to her neighbour’s adjoining upstairs maisonette, or vice versa. “There is no party wall between the two lofts and as a consequence, that’s a fire risk,” she said. “The actual party wall itself has a huge, great crack in it … that is a terrible fire risk. It’s only half a brick wide. Downstairs, there’s a boarded-up door that is also a fire risk … The list just goes on … there are things that really should have just been immediately dealt with.” She adds: “It makes you wonder how much respect they actually do have for their tenants.” Despite the problems Smith doesn’t want to move from her home. “I have lived here for 38 years and I love my home … My mother just lives up the road. I care for my mother. My friends are here. My neighbour is my friend. What move where? This is my home,” she said. David Launn, 52, moved into a Salvation Army semi-detached home with his parents and siblings in the 1980s, when he was a teenager, and still lives there with his 88-year-old mother, Rita. For years they have been putting up with a hole in the roof that has resulted in constant damp inside the house. “It hurts, [we feel] neglected, forgotten about,” he said. The windows need urgent attention, he said. There’s “the damp problem, obviously the roof, because we need to keep the heat in the house. Not have it blowing up out the house. The windows and the doors don’t fit properly … [I] have to have the heating on 24 hours a day to keep the house warm [in the winter].” Rita, a Christian who lives with him and suffers from arthritis and angina, has had to have her bedroom moved to a downstairs room to avoid the worst of the problems. She said: “[The Salvation Army treated us] badly, but at the same time, I’m sorry for them. Because they don’t realise what damage they’re doing and what harm they’re doing to other people. Not just me, all our neighbours … It hurts really.” Barry Bull lived in a Salvation Army property in Hadleigh for 40 years – and worked as a dairyman on the charity’s farm for 30 years. His daughter says his final years were spent dealing with a cold and vermin-infested property, while he suffered from stomach cancer. Tracey Longcroft described the treatment of her father by the Salvation Army as “disgraceful”, adding that the charity never rectified the poor condition of the accommodation. She said the problems included rats in the loft, an insect infestation, gaps between the window panes and window frames that exposed the house to the weather and left it extremely cold during winter, a poor heating system, and dangerous electrics. The Salvation Army offered an “unreserved apology” to the tenants of Hadleigh, adding that “for some months now we have been working on an urgent action plan to bring these properties up to the correct standard”.",News/Society,"‘It hurts, we feel neglected’: Salvation Army’s tenants in Essex speak out",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/21/salvation-arm-tenants-hadleigh-essex-speak-out
4/22/2022,"The death of a 23-year-old man who ran away from a Priory mental health hospital and was killed by a train was “contributed to by neglect” on the part of the institution, an inquest has concluded. After a two-week inquest at Birmingham coroner’s court, the jury found it was not safe for Matthew Caseby to be left unattended in the courtyard where he jumped over a low fence, and staff had “missed an opportunity” to improve the area’s security after previous patients had absconded. They also highlighted poor record-keeping, inadequate risk assessments and the absence of a policy on observation of the courtyard. In a statement, Matthew’s father, Richard Caseby, said the inquest had shown “a litany of failings” at the hospital: “The Priory Group were accountable for Matthew’s care and safety yet they failed profoundly to prevent harm to him. “To prevent such tragedies ever happening again, NHS England should review its national policy of outsourcing mental health beds to a supplier like the Priory, which consistently fails to keep patients safe.” Just 60 hours after being admitted, Matthew absconded from the Priory Woodbourne in Birmingham when left unsupervised in a courtyard. He had been sectioned as an NHS patient under the Mental Health Act after being found running along a railway line and telling doctors he was hearing voices. His father, Richard Caseby, told the inquest he raced up to Birmingham from London to help search for Matthew, and was just 200 yards away from his son when he was hit by a train near the university station. He said Priory staff told him patients absconded “all the time”, and that Matthew had been deemed a low suicide risk, even though he was diagnosed as psychotic. Forensic psychiatrist Prof Jennifer Shaw, who carried out an independent investigation into Matthew’s case, told the inquest he was at high risk of absconding, having previously tailgated staff and “eyed up” the fence, but was still left unattended. She said other patients had previously absconded from the hospital and staff had “raised concerns […] that they felt hadn’t been listened to”. She said it wasn’t until another patient absconded on 19 November 2020, two months after Matthew’s death, “that there was any change in the physical security of that courtyard”. Deborah Coles, director of Inquest, said the charity was “deeply concerned by the number of deaths occurring at Priory-run mental health units nationally”. “Neglect contributing to the premature and preventable death of Matthew, a young man who had his life ahead of him, once again demonstrates the inability of these services to change,” she said. “How many more people must die before the NHS and government reconsider commissioning services from a company that puts profit over patient safety?” The inquest also heard that, 42 days after his son’s death, Richard was told by NHS staff that Matthew was still alive and being cared for. Fiona Reynolds, chief medical officer at Birmingham Women’s and Children’s NHS Trust (BWCH) which outsourced Matthew’s treatment to the Priory, said: “I am appalled and I have apologised. It should not have happened. Mr Caseby should not have been subjected to that and I am very sorry.” Matthew, a personal trainer who had a first-class degree in history from Birmingham university, began seeing a counsellor in 2019 and his mental health deteriorated during lockdown. “He was loved by his family and he had so much promise,” Richard said. “After a long campaign, we are pleased that the truth has finally been heard.” A Priory spokesperson said: “We would like to say how deeply sorry we are to Matthew’s family, and we apologise unreservedly for the shortcomings in care identified during both the investigation process and the inquest. “We accept that the care provided at Woodbourne in this instance fell below the high standard patients and their families rightly expect from us, and we fully recognise that improvements are needed to the service.” They added changes to policies and procedures at the hospital have already been implemented, but they would study the coroner’s findings to ensure all steps are taken to improve patient safety.Reynolds said on behalf of BWCH that Matthew “tragically did not receive the standard of care [from the Priory] he deserved when he was at his most vulnerable”. “This is why we commissioned both an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death and a comprehensive review of contracting arrangements with The Priory Group. The recommendations of both of these reviews have already been implemented.”",News/UK news,"Priory hospital neglect contributed to death of patient, jury finds",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/21/priory-hospital-neglect-contributed-to-death-of-patient-jury-finds
