2/1/2022,"The AFLW star Tayla Harris has told a parliamentary inquiry that continued cyber abuse she has suffered since the infamous photo of her kicking a goal went viral has had a negative impact on her mental health. The 24-year-old gave evidence at the parliamentary inquiry into social media and online safety on Tuesday where she spoke about being attacked when she moved from Carlton to Melbourne last year.  Here’s a pic of me at work... think about this before your derogatory comments, animals. pic.twitter.com/68aBVVbTTj Harris said when she switched teams from Carlton to Melbourne in 2021, she began to receive “some pretty nasty and hurtful comments” from people in private messages or post tags after, she claimed, a narrative was created that she wanted much more money. “Which wasn’t true, which was the most frustrating part,” she said. “So my responsibility after speaking with my team was I just needed to just go about my business and get on with it, I guess, on the footy field. “So that was the concerning thing, that people, obviously particularly men, are just so obsessed with the idea that women do not deserve anything near what the men deserve.” She said it was an attack on her character and left her in a worse mental state than when the photo incident happened. Harris said she would love to delete all social media and had retreated from posting. “I’ve very consciously not been using it and not been active recently, which is disappointing because I love to share positive messaging, I love to inspire people, but at what cost?” she said. “Anything I put [up] is a platform for someone to come back with more hurtful things, and I don’t have the energy to continue to delete [them]. “And the reason I would delete is because I don’t want a 15-year-old girl who’s aspiring to be a footy player to see what she might be exposed to … I am so conflicted, because I want to inspire people, I don’t want them to be exposed to the kind of people that think it’s acceptable to pile on.” The inquiry is part of the federal government’s push to introduce laws that would force social media platforms to take down offending posts and, in some circumstances, reveal the identity of anonymous posters. A Hawthorn Indigenous player, Chad Wingard, said the online bullying of players around the time they are traded from one club to another is damaging. “I know a lot of people will say that it comes with being an AFL player but … being bullied or being discriminated against isn’t a job description,” he said. He said the AFL gives players training on the pros and cons of social media, but does not prepare players for the toll it can take. Wingard called for people to need to be identifiable on social media, pointing to an incident on Instagram where a “burner account” with one follower commented a monkey emoji on a photo of 10 AFL players. “It’s taken him five minutes to really ruin 10 people’s days, weeks, months, it could be years to get over that kind of stuff, and that’s how easy it is for someone to really make an impact,” he said. “And it’s not the one comment. It’s the thousands, it’s the daily, it’s the weekly struggles – people don’t understand that.” Wingard said while he initially let it slide, he has decided to call abuse out every single time now. Tanya Hosch, executive general manager of inclusion and diversity at the AFL, told the committee she knows some players keep a minimum presence on social media as a result of the abuse. “We wouldn’t have any data on that, but I certainly anecdotally know that there are some players who just have a minimum presence as a result of direct abuse themselves or through watching other teammates, friends, family members going through a terrible amount of abuse,” she said.",News/Society,‘Nasty and hurtful’: AFL players speak out against cyber abuse at online safety inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/01/nasty-and-hurtful-afl-players-speak-out-against-cyber-abuse-at-online-safety-inquiry
2/1/2022,"When social media influencers turned up at the Azimuth music festival in the middle of the Saudi Arabian desert they were promised a festival of musical and gastronomic excess, all subsidised by an arm of the Saudi government. What attendees did not know was that the pricey music festival was secretly organised by youth media company Vice, as part of the media company’s ongoing push to make money in the Middle Eastern state despite the country’s poor human rights record.  Just three years after Vice publicly announced that it was pausing all work in Saudi Arabia due to the fallout from the state-ordered murder of dissident Jamal Khashoggi, insiders at Vice told the Guardian the company was once again aggressively pursuing business opportunities in Saudi Arabia. “Vice employees have for years raised concerns over the company’s involvement with Saudi Arabia – and we’ve been fobbed off with empty statements and pathetic excuses,” said one Vice employee. Although the Azimuth music festival received little publicity in the western media when it took place at the start of the Covid pandemic, it is believed to be have been highly lucrative for Vice. Staff at the company estimate the total budget was $20m (£15m). Azimuth Festival 2020, AlUla, KSA. Where History Meets Culture.Until next year !#AzimuthFestival#WhereHistoryMeetsCulture pic.twitter.com/fI7YjK9rqt The event promised to bring together the best of eastern culture (it took place among ancient carvings at the historic world heritage site of Al-’Ula on an ancient trade route) with the best of western culture (it featured a performance from the dance duo Chainsmokers). The lineup was topped by French electronic musician Jean-Michel Jarre who appeared alongside rapper Tinie Tempah. High-end chefs from restaurants such as New York’s Michelin-starred Contra and London’s Annabel’s were flown in to cook for guests. British contemporary artists Lauren Baker joined the conceptual studio Shuster + Moseley to provide special art displays. 🚨🚨🚨 The wait is over. Azimuth festival is here! 🚨🚨🚨 #AzimuthFestival #WhereHistoryMeetsCulture pic.twitter.com/qb7oKKM7H8 Despite this, efforts were taken to keep Vice’s name off the event. Contractors who worked on the music festival – organised through Vice’s creative marketing agency Virtue – were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements, while Vice’s did not appear on public marketing material. Saudi Arabia is desperate to spend big money to rebrand itself in the eyes of western youth – and Vice, despite its counter-cultural roots, is now an ageing business that needs to improve its financial position fast. The company rode the new-media start-up wave of the early part of this century but has already burned through billions of dollars of investment – all while also dealing with allegations of sexual harassment and trying to deliver a financial return to investors. As a result, the money on offer in the Middle East has been tempting and Vice last year opened a dedicated office in the Saudi capital Riyadh. It has also had a deal to make promotional films for the country in conjunction with the Saudi Research and Marketing Group, a business with close ties to the Saudi state which also has a partnership with the Independent and Evening Standard. One employee claimed Vice executives were acutely aware of the potential reputational damage that could be caused if Vice’s western audience became aware of the extent to which it was working with the Saudi state, saying: “It is astounding that – despite ongoing opposition from staff – Vice is still happy to take money from a country that was literally responsible for the state-sanctioned murder of a journalist.” Asked about concerns from staff about its return to doing business in Saudi Arabia, a spokesperson for Vice said: “Vice Arabia was set up over four years ago as part of our global expansion – alongside many other media and content businesses who have expanded into the region. Vice has always been about creativity and culture for youth in every corner of the world – and in the Saudi Region, two-thirds of the population are under the age of 35. “We opened a commercial and creative office in Riyadh earlier this year, which was reported and shared publicly. Our editorial voice has and always will report with complete autonomy and independence.”",News/Media,Vice Media secretly organised $20m Saudi government festival,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/01/vice-media-secretly-organised-20m-saudi-government-festival
2/1/2022,"Internal documents and Slack messages obtained by the Guardian reveal senior executives at the New York Times are heavily leaning on workers to vote “no”in a union election for more than 600 tech employees at the media company. CEO of the New York Times Meredith Kopit Levien wrote a memo on 19 January circulated to staff titled “Why a Tech Union isn’t Right for Us” on the tech workers’ union election at XFun, the group within the New York Times responsible for product development operations.  “In short, we don’t believe unionizing in XFun is the right move. But that’s not because I’m anti-union,” said Kopit Levien. In the memo, Kopit Levien went on to cite the origin of the XFun group and its growth, and attributed some disconnect workers might be feeling to working apart during the pandemic. She goes on to cite Wirecutter’s union as a warning sign for unionization. Workers at Wirecutter walked out on Black Friday weekend in late November 2021 and called on the public to boycott the publication, alleging that the New York Times was bargaining in bad faith and in protest of unfair labor practices. Shortly after the walkout, an agreement was reached between the union and the Times management. “It took Wirecutter two years to reach an agreement with the NewsGuild. And the result of those prolonged Wirecutter negotiations was a set of terms that are, in most ways, what the rest of the company already enjoys. This was two years of uncertainty and discord to negotiate terms that were largely in line with what they and their non-union colleagues already had in place,” said Kopit Levien. She emphasized the relationship between management and workers, alleging the relationship would be disrupted by a union, and that the New York Times’ diversity, equity and inclusion goals would also be disrupted by a union. Kopit Levien concluded, “This is an unproven experiment with permanent consequences.” In Slack messages, Times chief product officer Alexandra Hardiman and chief growth officer Hannah Yang posted messages urging workers to vote “no” in the union election. Yang reshared the CEO’s letter to workers, prompting workers to see it on the company’s internal election resources hub. “A union is not a silver bullet,” wrote Hardiman, urging workers to vote no. “It will introduce another layer into our process that we believe will make it harder to work – and achieve – together.” Yang argued that a union would “dilute” the voice of smaller teams within the group of workers. “If you have any concerns about how your voice will be represented in negotiations, we urge you to vote no for the union.” “We encourage you to vote no,” a leaflet distributed by the Times to workers said. It cited three reasons: “weakening relationships between employees and managers”, “lengthy negotiating processes and inflexible multi-year agreements” and “reducing your flexibility to learn new skills”. The Slack messages from the executive were quickly flooded by negative emojis. Only a select few workers can post in the staff-wide Slack channels, so emojis are often the only way most workers can respond to the posts. Ballots for the mail-in election were sent out on 24 January and are due on 28 February, with vote tallies to be counted on 7 March. The National Labor Relations Board rejected the New York Times’ attempt to stop the election, alleging the bargaining unit was improper. The company had previously declined to voluntarily recognize the union and immediately began holding anti-union captive audience meetings with workers. The NewsGuild of New York filed a complaint earlier this month with the National Labor Relations Board accusing the Times of violating federal labor law by adding new paid days off to the company holiday calendar for non-union employees only, which was viewed as a tactic to dissuade workers from voting for the union. After the complaint was filed, the New York Times made similar changes to its bereavement policy, making it applicable only to non-union workers. The union is collecting signatures as part of a public petition demanding that the New York Times stop union busting. On 5 January, the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against the Times, ruling the company violated federal labor law by telling some employees they could not show support for tech workers seeking to unionize. If successful, the tech workers at the New York Times would form the largest bargaining unit of tech workers in the US, according to the union.",News/Media,Leaked messages reveal New York Times’ aggressive anti-union strategy,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/01/leaked-messages-new-york-times-anti-union-strategy
2/1/2022,"Marcus Rashford is writing a follow-up to his bestselling debut You Are a Champion, in which the England footballer will explore “how to celebrate and champion difference”. Rashford’s first book, published last May and co-written by Carl Anka, was the bestselling children’s non-fiction title of last year, selling over 220,000 copies in the UK, according to its publisher. His and Anka’s follow-up, which will be called You Can Do It: How to Find Your Team and Make a Difference, will be published in July, Macmillan Children’s Books said today.  Rashford said that before he and Anka put together the idea for You Can Do It, they spent time with children who had read You Are a Champion, “understanding what they took away from the book and what tools we could still equip them with, so they are best prepared for adult life”. “The insight sessions were brilliant and I’m proud of the outcome, focusing on how we can best champion one another, and view difference as a positive rather than a means to discriminate,” Rashford said. “This is about how you can use your voice to support others.” Described as an “inspirational guide” for children aged between 10 and 14, You Can Do It will see the footballer “encourage readers to use their voice to champion causes they care about”, and give advice about the importance of teamwork, how “even the smallest changes can have the biggest impact”, and how to “use your voice to make a meaningful change for the better”. Anka said he “leapt” at the chance to collaborate with Rashford again. “We want to build on some of the ideas and principles developed in the first book and hopefully create something to help young people foster their communities and go out and shape the world,” said Anka.

2/1/2022,"In this frenetic, rumbustious new graphic biography of Diego Rivera by Francisco de la Mora and José Luis Pescador, the Mexican artist’s third wife (and fourth: they married twice) appears only fleetingly. We don’t find out where or how they met; the powerful connection between them, never fully explained, must simply be taken for granted by the reader. But perhaps the authors feel that Frida Kahlo has had a bit too much attention just lately: who could forget the snaking queues at the V&A’s show of her work in 2018? In their book, then, it’s Rivera who is centre stage. Like a raging bull, rushing into the ring for a fight, he dominates every page, all bristling melodrama and animal energy. “There have been two great accidents in my life,” Kahlo said. “Diego was by far the worst.” There is surely hyperbole in this statement, however unhappy Rivera made her at times (both of them were repeatedly unfaithful). But you grasp her meaning: the sense of collision that accompanied her husband wherever he went. Though his talent was prodigious – he went to art school at 11 – it often struggled to find its place in a life that was by any standards overpopulated with incident. Born in 1886, Rivera was the son of a journalist who was involved in revolutionary politics, instincts he would famously go on to share. Travelling in Europe, he met Lenin in Paris and Stalin in Moscow; later, he offered refuge to Trotsky during his Mexican exile. But revolutionaries come in many guises. If he talked the talk – even after fame arrived, he remained proudly un-clubbable – he was also easily distracted, usually (though not exclusively) by women.  De la Mora and Pescador pick and choose when it comes to the biographical details. They make little, for instance, of Rivera’s Jewishness on his mother’s side – her family was supposed to have converso history (ancestors who were forced to convert to Catholicism) – something that he felt informed both his art and his politics. But they’re predictably enthralled – and who can blame them? – by his years in Paris, where he knew Braque, Picasso and Modigliani and embraced cubism (a passion that did not last). There is, perhaps, a bit too much wild sex in their book – bed springs are always groaning; women are ecstatic at his merest touch – but they make the most both of his return to Mexico and, later, the time he spent in the US, where he accepted commissions from such giants of capitalism as John D Rockefeller. Pescador, who illustrates, has a feeling for the epic scene; he knows just how to do it, stepping back from the frame, opening things out. Depicting the artist at work at his mural The History of Mexico in the stairwell of the National Palace in Mexico City – Rivera’s Sistine Chapel, it took six years to complete – he uses fold-out pages, the better to give us a 360-degree fix on the spectacle and the result is quite wonderful, a moment of quiet in a narrative that is at times very noisy. Rivera and Kahlo, now in a wheelchair, are tiny on a landing. Like two small children, their chins are raised, they eyes look ever upwards. Here is his vision, vast and teeming and fervent, and it seems that even they must struggle to take it all in.

2/1/2022,"When BBC Three is reborn as an on-air channel at 7pm today, its schedule includes Eating With My Ex, a post-dating format in which former lovers meet up over a meal. It’s an appropriate choice given that the network itself is returning to a former partner after a split that caused serious disagreement and left messy unfinished business.  The first three series of Eating With My Ex were branded as BBC Three content but could only be streamed via iPlayer, as the youth-oriented service, which launched in 2003, was dropped from the airwaves in 2016 when the BBC was looking for budget cuts. However, the chances of a long, harmonious partnership second time around have been vastly reduced by this comeback coinciding with a funding crisis even more severe than the one that axed BBC Three six years ago. When the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, recently announced that the £159 TV licence would be frozen for two years, fall behind inflation for six and might cease completely from 2028, BBC director-general Tim Davie warned that the necessary economies might “absolutely” include axing channels. As a result, Three might feel this week like an ex who arrives at the reunion restaurant to be told the other person already feels this is a bad idea. In adding another channel while simultaneously threatening to cut some, the BBC might seem to many viewers chaotic and contradictory. But to be fair, the timing was not its choice. Still, there is reason to wonder if the restoration of Three ever made sense. In 2016, the corporation gave these reasons for the decision to move the channel aimed at 16- to 34-year-olds to iPlayer alone: although Three had an impressive hit record (Gavin & Stacey, Little Britain, Murdered By My Boyfriend etc), data showed that the target demographic was much more likely to watch by streaming or catchup than on linear TV. In 2022, these are the reasons given for the reversal: younger viewers still watch a surprising amount of linear television, and terrestrial restoration ensures that there will be a dedicated BBC channel for them, viewing of which will “complement” iPlayer viewing and may even drive additional youth viewing to it. These contrasting rationales are explained by recent research revealing that younger audiences are failing to make a progression that was once standard – from watching Doctor Who courtesy of a licence fee bought by your parents or place of education, to enjoying 9pm crime dramas covered by a permit you paid for yourself. The regulator Ofcom and BBC bosses hope the return of a linear BBC Three will help to restore the BBC habit to the absconding demographic. But even before the additional difficulty of whether the corporation can afford another linear network, the strategy looked a huge and probably futile gamble. Are younger viewers really consuming fewer BBC shows because there isn’t a button on the remote for them, or because they prefer material from rival streamers such as Netflix, Sky and Disney or the vast quantities of other content available online? Will the return of “their” channel energise them to buy TV licences, or has the impulse to fund public service broadcasting gone, killed by the multiplicity of content and the widespread (though false) belief that no licence is needed to watch BBC content online? The relaunch schedules also raise the question of what BBC Three is for. During its streaming interlude, the franchise proved a very impressive feeder to the main BBC channels. Normal People, Clique, Fleabag and People Just Do Nothing were among the many shows to flourish on BBC One or Two after iPlayer debuts. Shows on the new Three include Conversations With Friends (another Sally Rooney adaptation) and Mood, a comedy drama with a genesis very similar to Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag, having also started as a solo theatre piece: Nicôle Lecky’s Superhoe. Aside from the issue of how the BBC hopes to appeal to younger viewers if Superhoe is apparently considered too rude a title to use on air, have Normal People and Fleabag not opened up a space on One and Two into which Conversations With Friends and Mood could move at once? Similarly, Stacey Dooley, one of the best reporters on television, has made another impressive documentary called Stalkers, about those who inflict and suffer obsessive attention. But surely such a combination of star and subject matter could, even should, be on BBC One? At a relaunch event, Dooley joked that she was surprised to be involved – she also fronts a new Three cookery show, Hungry for It – as, 35 next birthday, she is about to move beyond the channel’s demographic. But the gag raises a serious point: as Dooley is at such a different age and stage now, why is the channel still being branded with her? And, although BBC management would hate this conclusion to be drawn at this point of the debate with government on the corporation’s funding, BBC Three may show the way towards a subscription model. Younger viewers might be persuaded to pay, among a portfolio of subscriptions, a low-ish fee for Three-like material. Traditionalists would object that this arrangement would deny them exposure to BBC News, wildlife shows and arts documentaries, but viewing, especially among the young, no longer works like that, and the reappearance of an old channel seems unlikely to change that. Diners on Eating With My Ex often find that there were very good reasons for having gone their separate ways. That feels dangerously likely to be the case with BBC TV and BBC Three.",Arts/Television & radio,A huge and probably futile gamble: the strange TV return of BBC Three,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/01/a-huge-and-probably-futile-gamble-the-strange-tv-return-of-bbc-three
2/1/2022,"The company behind Irn-Bru has revealed it is increasing its prices after its packaging, ingredients and energy-linked commodity costs jumped, as it raised its sales and profit estimates. AG Barr said owing to rising costs it had put up prices “where appropriate” and signalled further price increases as it pointed to the UK’s inflation rate rising above 5%, the highest in decades.  Sales of the Scottish fizzy drink, made to a secret recipe, are likely to have been boosted in part by it becoming the talk of the recent climate summit Cop26 in Glasgow. The drink made global headlines when the US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted an Instagram video of herself praising Irn-Bru, after being handed a can by the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, on her arrival in Glasgow. Irn-Bru is often referred to as Scotland’s other national drink – after whisky – and AG Barr was the exclusive soft drink and water supplier at two convention centres in Glasgow used during Cop26. The company, which also makes Rubicon drinks and Funkin cocktail mixers, said it made revenues of £267m in the year to 30 January, up 17.5% on the previous year and ahead of its own expectations – despite the spread of the Omicron Covid variant and restrictions on socialising. Sales are also higher than its pre-pandemic performance of £255.7m. As a result, AG Barr expects its full-year profit before tax and one-off items to be slightly higher than its November estimate of £41m. The company said: “While government restrictions have impacted consumer behaviour across the year, both our Barr Soft Drinks and Funkin business units have traded well, particularly during the periods when restrictions were eased.” Its chief executive, Roger White, said: “We have remained fully operational throughout the year, producing high-quality products and providing strong business support to all of our customers. “We have delivered an excellent financial performance against a volatile backdrop, while at the same time delivering on our strategic priorities.”",News/Business,Irn-Bru maker raises prices as UK inflation soars,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/01/irn-bru-raises-prices-uk-inflation-ag-barr-sales-profit
2/1/2022,"Two years after Brexit formally took effect on 31 January 2020, and a year since the UK’s exit from the single market and customs union, we can attempt a provisional economic stocktake for both sides. Nearly 52% of UK voters supported Brexit in the 2016 referendum. Nearly 100% of citizens elsewhere in the bloc were shocked by the result, and the first concern was that Brexit could mark the unravelling of the whole European project. That did not happen: indeed, quite the opposite. Even in the most Eurosceptic countries there was an increase in support for the European Union, a sort of closing of the ranks. There was a clear risk that the EU would become disunited in the buildup to Brexit. But again, it did not happen. All countries gave a strong mandate to the European Commission, and stood united.  Today, British politics appears increasingly folded in on itself, and the British economy is arguably less outward-looking than before the referendum. Countless questions remain unresolved with the commission, and mutual trust between London and Brussels has long since collapsed. From the EU, the drama of the Brexit negotiations was watched with mixed feelings. Initial regret shifted to a desire to limit the damage. Some economic opportunities to fill the gaps left by the UK opened up. Brexit was clearly going to be a loss for everyone, but far greater for the UK than for any continental European economy. The negative impact on trade, so far, is substantial for the UK. The Centre for European Reform recently estimated that there has been an 11.2% negative impact on trade as a result of Brexit. The UK share of world trade has fallen by a further 15% compared to pre-referendum projections. Assessing the impact of Brexit on the EU presents a challenge, as macro-economic data is contaminated by the pandemic shock. However, digging into the details of trade flows, there has been a noticeable negative effect on some countries, sectors and firms. This has been especially sizeable for small producers who used to have unbounded single market access to the UK. Now, the extra paperwork puts off firms that lack the critical mass to absorb the extra fixed costs of handling non-EU trade procedures. Over time, the situation may well improve, but some companies have already given up. British consumers have paid the price, EU consumers far less. A more precise picture of the geographical and sectoral composition will emerge once EU funds to compensate countries for the impact of Brexit are distributed. Since 2016, the flow of EU workers to the UK has been in decline. That process accelerated last year, causing major imbalances in hospitality, agriculture, transport and healthcare, but also in some highly qualified jobs. The corresponding impact in the EU is a greater pool of labour in some countries and less of a brain drain, which increases unemployment but over time becomes a positive supply-side phenomenon. Again, while the impact is sizeable for the UK, it is very much diluted in continental Europe. Although the impact of Brexit on the City of London is not yet significant, the possibility of maintaining an undisputed dominant position in increasingly integrated European financial markets has been jeopardised. On the margins, London financial job openings have moved to continental Europe, and some firms have relocated. The historically Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative party wanted Brexit to deliver more freedom from what was perceived as the unnecessary constraints and bureaucratic burdens imposed by Brussels. A minority ultra-liberal wing naively dreamt of an even more open, deregulated, low-tax environment to increase economic dynamism and transform the UK into a Singapore-like haven. That raised fears in the EU of unfair competition through access to the single market, especially given the uncooperative approach to negotiations chosen by the UK government. Again though, these risks have by and large not materialised and concerns are dissipating. The illusion of giving a boost to the UK economy with a reduction in taxation has clashed with the new needs for public spending for healthcare, the fight against the climate crisis, infrastructure investments, and the various electoral promises to the point of forcing the government to raise taxes. Instead of diverging, policies in the UK and the EU look increasingly alike. Finally, there are non-tangible effects. In the past, the UK government has been obstructive on various initiatives aimed at strengthening the EU’s architecture and achieving stronger economic and political integration. It opted out of schemes developed to alleviate the impact of the financial and economic crisis on Greece and other economies. Would the ambitious €800bn (£665bn) pandemic recovery plan have even been possible with the UK government still around the table? Some in Brussels would say it would have been inconceivable. The economic effects of the pandemic inevitably blur into those of Brexit, and therefore only once the dust settles can the damage be properly assessed. Of the many problems the EU is currently facing, Brexit has happily receded from the foreground.

2/1/2022,"The threat to the west from the Chinese government is “more brazen, more damaging” than ever before, FBI director Christopher Wray has said, accusing Beijing of stealing American ideas and innovation and launching massive hacking operations. The speech at the Reagan Presidential Library in California on Monday amounted to a stinging rebuke of the Chinese government just days before Beijing is set to occupy the global stage by hosting the Winter Olympics.  In another salvo from the US towards China on Monday, billionaire George Soros said Chinese president Xi Jinping was the “greatest threat” to open society throughout the world. However, he added in his speech that the crisis engulfing China’s “unsustainable” property market could be the downfall of Xi, along with other mounting problems such as containing Omicron, the pursuit of total social control, and a plummeting birthrate. Wray’s remarks made clear that even as American foreign policy remains consumed by Russia-Ukraine tensions, the US continues to regard China as its biggest threat to long-term economic security. “When we tally up what we see in our investigations, over 2,000 of which are focused on the Chinese government trying to steal our information or technology, there’s just no country that presents a broader threat to our ideas, innovation, and economic security than China,” Wray said, according to a copy of the speech provided by the FBI. The bureau is opening new cases to counter Chinese intelligence operations every 12 hours or so, Wray said, with Chinese government hackers pilfering more personal and corporate data than all other countries combined “The harm from the Chinese government’s economic espionage isn’t just that its companies pull ahead based on illegally gotten technology. While they pull ahead, they push our companies and workers behind,” Wray said. “That harm – company failures, job losses – has been building for a decade to the crush we feel today. It’s harm felt across the country, by workers in a whole range of industries.” Chinese government officials have repeatedly rejected accusations from the US government, with the spokesperson for the embassy in Washington saying in July last year that Americans have made “groundless attacks” and malicious smears about Chinese cyber-attacks. The statement described China as a “staunch defender of cybersecurity”. The threat from China is hardly new, but it has also not abated over the past decade.“I’ve spoken a lot about this threat since I became director” in 2017, Wray said. “But I want to focus on it here tonight because it’s reached a new level – more brazen, more damaging, than ever before, and it’s vital, vital that all of us focus on that threat together.” Speaking at a Hoover Institution panel on China, Soros said the victory of open societies “can’t be taken for granted” in a world teetering on the edge of military aggression in Ukraine and Taiwan. However, Xi Jinping’s attempt to impose “total control” on China through a strategy of city-wide lockdowns, could jeopardise his chances of staying in power, Soros claimed, because they are “unlikely to work against a variant as infectious as Omicron”. Despite Xi’s firm control over the military and his tools of repression and surveillance, Soros said that it should not be assumed, given strong internal opposition, that the president will stay in power. He rules by “intimidation” and “nobody dares to tell him what he doesn’t want to hear”, he said. The Soros comments appeared timed to coincide with the run-up to the Winter Olympics, although several countries – including the US and UK – will not be sending any diplomats in protest at human rights abuses in Xinjiang and elsewhere. Soros also argued that the world’s second-biggest economy has become too dependent on using “unsustainable” property development to power growth since Xi took power in 2013. The sector that accounts for about 30% ofChinese economic output was faltering with high-profile failures such as Evergrande spreading throughout the industry, leaving “people’s confidence shaken” and the economy struggling, he said. Add in the disruption caused by trying to stamp out every case of the Covid-19, and a falling population that will lead to labour shortages, and China’s economic growth could not be taken for granted. “The model on which the real estate boom is based is unsustainable. People buying apartments have to start paying for them even before they are built. So, the system is built on credit. Local governments derive most of their revenues from selling land at ever-rising prices. The fall in prices already under way in many parts of China “will turn many of those who invested the bulk of their savings in real estate against Xi”, Soros claimed.",News/World news,"China more ‘brazen and damaging’ than ever, says FBI director",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/01/china-more-brazen-and-damaging-than-ever-says-fbi-director
