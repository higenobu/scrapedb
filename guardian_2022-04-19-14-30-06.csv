4/19/2022,"Diners in Japan could soon be able to savour the umami of a bowl of ramen or miso soup without having to worry about their salt intake. In what they claim is a world first, researchers have developed chopsticks that artificially create the taste of salt, as part of efforts to reduce sodium levels in some of the country’s most popular dishes. The chopsticks work by using electrical stimulation and a mini-computer worn on the eater’s wristband. The device transmits sodium ions from food, through the chopsticks, to the mouth where they create a sense of saltiness, according to Homei Miyashita, a professor at Meiji University in Tokyo, whose laboratory collaborated with the food and drink manufacturer Kirin to develop the device. The team said they would refine the prototype and hoped to make the chopsticks available to consumers next year. The utensils could find a receptive audience in Japan, where the traditional diet tends to be high in salt due to the use of ingredients such as miso and soy sauce. The average Japanese adult consumes about 10 grams of salt a day, double the amount recommended by the World Health Organization. The health ministry has proposed reducing daily salt intake to a maximum of 7.5 grams for men and 6.5 grams for women. The chopsticks use “very weak electricity – not enough to affect the human body – to adjust the function of ions such as sodium chloride and sodium glutamate to change the perception of taste by making food seem to taste stronger or weaker”, Kirin said in a statement. Miyashita and Kirin said clinical tests on people who follow a low-sodium diet had confirmed that the device enhances the salty taste of low-sodium food by about 1.5 times. They said participants given reduced-salt miso soup had commented on the improved “richness, sweetness and overall tastiness” of the dish. High salt intake can contribute to high blood pressure, which is the single biggest cause of heart attacks and strokes. “To prevent these diseases, we need to reduce the amount of salt we take,” said Kirin researcher Ai Sato. “If we try to avoid taking less salt in a conventional way, we would need to endure the pain of cutting our favourite food from our diet, or endure eating bland food.” Miyashita’s lab is exploring other ways in which technology can be used to engage the senses – it has also invented a lickable TV screen that imitates the flavours of various foods.

4/19/2022,"As the government presses ahead with the privatisation of Channel 4 , famous faces have come out swinging. Kirstie Allsopp, of Location, Location, Location, tweeted “no true Conservative would sell Channel 4” and the broadcaster “was set up to foster the British film and TV industry and it has done that job admirably”. Russell T Davies, creator of It’s a Sin, suggested that a privatised broadcaster would be less likely to commission queer and diverse voices. Meanwhile, the broadcaster and naturalist David Attenborough signed an open letter calling for an end to “short-sighted political and financial attacks” on public service broadcasters. While the government insists that the sell-off would “give Channel 4 the tools and freedom to flourish and thrive as a public service broadcaster long into the future”, some argue that it is a politically motivated retaliation against a channel long perceived as left-leaning, and which angered No 10 with stunts such as replacing the Boris Johnson with a melting ice sculpture after the prime minister didn’t turn up to a climate change debate. Dorothy Byrne, a former Channel 4 editor-at-large, has described the looming privatisation as “a nice bit of red meat, to throw to [Boris Johnson’s] rightwing supporters, who are currently unhappy at him”. The fear is that much of what made the channel a unique and disruptive broadcasting force may be lost. We asked leading figures from Channel 4’s history to reflect on its optimistic and sometimes chaotic early days. The first time I ever heard of Channel 4, it was called the fourth channel. That gives you an indication of how big the media were at the time. Its remit was to create the independent sector in the UK, and open up that market to advertising. I knew I wanted in. Jeremy Isaacs [the founding chief executive of Channel 4] held an event at the Royal Institution in 1981. It was like a gathering of the senate, with Jeremy in the centre – the emperor – giving his address. I remember walking through the throng, and everyone was slapping him on the back. I said: “Hi, Jeremy. I’m Phil Redmond. I do [the BBC One children’s drama] Grange Hill. Will you allow me to say fuck at 8pm?” The hubbub quietened. Then he said: “Come and see me at 9am tomorrow.” He was in an empty office on the Brompton Road, opposite Harrods. I told him he needed a soap. Every successful channel has one. Jeremy told me he couldn’t afford it. I said: “Tell me how much you have, and I’ll tell you how we can make it happen.” That’s how I became the third person to join Channel 4. The launch night, on 2 November 1982, was crazy. As episode one of Brookside went out, I was still editing episodes three and four. I left at 7pm to watch the first episode go out, and 10 minutes after it finished, I was back in the edit suite, frantically trying to get the next ones done. The day after, I like to joke that national cardiac arrest rates rocketed. The press was aghast at all the swearing. We had a chat, and agreed to tone down the language to save the overall project. Our viewing figures were in a ski slope decline for nine months. Brookside had been marketed to the wrong audience. After the first year, the audience started to come back. People got the message: Brookside is for 16- to 24-year-olds. But getting the soap renewed for a second year was the hardest negotiation I had ever been in. We had to persuade them that the potential was there. Eventually, the advertising revenue for Brookside and Hollyoaks covered the cost of Channel 4. Years later, Jeremy told me that we saved the channel. I thought, I wish he’d said that at the time! What Channel 4 did was give new voices a space to express their creativity. Jeremy was a creative’s dream. He would buy into people’s visions and fight for their projects. But I think the channel started to lose its way at the end of the 90s. It began to think about itself as a media company, which it shouldn’t have done because it couldn’t compete with the bigger players. They commissioned the wrong type of programmes, like test cricket. And when they poached The Great British Bake Off from the BBC, people saw it as a great coup, but really it was just one public service broadcaster outbidding another public service broadcaster. There was a lack of focus on the channel’s original vision, which was to provide a platform to the underrepresented. There was a hell of a buzz on launch night. The Channel 4 headquarters on Charlotte Street was swarming with people. Everyone was drinking champagne cocktails apart from me and the other people who had to put the thing on air. We went down to the basement. There were no windows, just TV monitors. There was this huge sense of occasion. You were very aware you were part of broadcasting history. Everything was live, apart from the opening announcement. We were worried that there might be a technical hitch, so I recorded myself saying: “Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be able to say to you, welcome to Channel 4.” When I listen back to it I cringe. Everything else was fine, but my opening. I modified my Scottish accent and ended up sounding like a Tom Conti impersonator. When the launch night was over, we came up with the idea of me blowing out a candle in the shape of the Channel 4 logo. But in rehearsal, every time I blew the candle out, it fell over and was in danger of setting fire to the studio. Luckily, on launch night, it didn’t fall over. I couldn’t sleep when I got home. I was so anxious to see the reviews. I don’t think there was any denying it: the reviews did deflate us. After that, it became us versus them. We knew that we knew what we were doing, and that the public just had to bear with us. And they did. People started to find their favourite shows: Brookside or The Tube, or The Last Resort With Jonathan Ross. I think the privatisation conversation has been coming for a long time. When Channel 4 was launched, it was in a completely different environment. It’s not the station it was in 1982. It didn’t have to be competitive back then. We could take more risks. Channel 4 needs to convince the public that this is the wrong idea. Do the public care? I’m not sure they do. By the time The Word aired in 1990, Channel 4 was already known for celebrating innovation and volatility. The BBC felt like “take your medicine” TV. ITV was mainstream. But Channel 4 was always flirting with disaster. Every time we did The Word, there was always the possibility it would go up in a big old bang. It was the norm for the Monday after a Friday broadcast to feature a newspaper editorial bemoaning the immorality of the show, usually written by a bishop. The notoriety was a badge of honour among production staff. To be fair, we did skate close to the wind. I remember one item where we put [actor] Oliver Reed in a dressing room full of vodka, with a camera trained on him. I was monitoring him on a hidden camera and offering commentary, before finally bringing him out, in front of a baying crowd. I wasn’t 100% certain if he was drunk, or if it was an act. He had a certain poise, even when he was off his face, that made me unsure who had the upper hand in that scenario. That was always the dissonance with The Word items: they danced between cruelty and entertainment; laughing at and laughing with people. We did crazy stuff, like floating through a flooded Welsh village on a dinghy, bringing people joke supplies. Once, we tried to make [former professional boxer] Barry McGuigan cry, because he was known for crying easily. We surprised him with a male choir singing Danny Boy, and fireworks spelling out his name. It was actually incredibly moving; we weren’t just taking the mickey. I think that’s harder to come by now on TV because viewers know all the moves. They’re sophisticated and cynical. I think the early 90s was the golden age of Channel 4. Everything was being invented. All the formats that are tried and tested, like “making ofs”, “behind the scenes”, “access all areas”, and reality TV: those things we see, in part, because of The Tube. Channel 4 also brought club culture to our screens for the first time. The first time we saw RuPaul on British TV was on Channel 4. It felt like the beginning of rock’n’roll – only this was rock’n’roll television. People have rewritten history when it comes to The Girlie Show. Everyone hated us! I remember being called a slut and a slag in the newspapers. People thought it was a shit version of The Word. But I had a great time. If it wasn’t for The Girlie Show, I wouldn’t have had a 15-year career in broadcasting. But it was difficult. The press weren’t very kind and we were babies. I was only 23. Back then, the senior executives at Channel 4 were very working class. They were real rebels. Everyone would make fun of me for being a middle-class girl who had taken ballet lessons. Youth TV was really innovative back then. People remember The Girlie Show for its shock value. We used to do a segment called Wanker of the Week. I hated doing it because I didn’t want to be nasty about anyone. Once I had to do Eamonn Holmes – he was having a spat with Anthea Turner at the time. I met him a few weeks later. I said: “Sorry! It was the producers, not me.” With the audience, there was the sense that anything could go wrong. I remember Tara Palmer-Tomkinson coming in once, off her face. God, she was lovely. After the show was cancelled, I worked in a charity shop for six months. I felt I had to redeem myself! Looking back now, I see what an important period of history it represented. We had the Spice Girls on, just as they became huge. It was the peak of the 90s. I was living hangover to hangover, out on the Britpop scene. It was all one big party. It was epic. In 1992, I was working at Oxford University Press, which publishes the dictionary used on Countdown. They lent the show a group of lexicographers who would take turns to sit in Dictionary Corner. My boss asked me if I’d be one of them. I said no, twice. Eventually he brought me round to the idea, and I’ll always be grateful to him for that. My first day was surreal. I spent it longing to hide behind Rula Lenska’s gorgeous hair, answering Richard’s [Whiteley] and Carol’s [Vorderman’s] questions and trying to make sense of the game. I think the success of Countdown is unquestionably the format: it’s a simple, quietly compelling game. It was the very first programme to be aired on Channel 4, and I like to think it’s still the bedrock of the daytime schedule. It’s a British institution that almost everyone has watched at some point in their life. The channel’s remit is to be innovative and inclusive, and I think Countdown fulfils that beautifully. We choose our contestants not for their telly appeal, but because they genuinely love the game – that integrity is, I think, at the heart of what Channel 4 is about. I worry that Channel 4’s incredible support of independent production companies will be diminished by privatisation, and that its bold programming and social impact will also be hit hard. The rate of HIV testing went up considerably after It’s a Sin, for example, while the scale of the Paralympics coverage this year was the biggest yet. This, for me, is the potential of a public broadcaster, not a private one. The early days were undoubtedly the happiest of my life. The atmosphere was very egalitarian. You could walk into Jeremy’s office and have a chat about anything. I always remember launch night: this wonderful, tumbling Channel 4 logo, and champagne corks popping all around the floor. It was so exhilarating. We had the freedom to do things that you just couldn’t do at the BBC or ITV, like make wacky trailers. I made one for The Tube with a voiceover that said: “Are you always missing the tube on a Friday night? Never mind! This clever man has recorded it.” Then I had some video of a tube train going backwards into a tunnel. The chief engineer went ballistic. It all simmered down in the end. You could never have gotten away with that at the BBC. At the beginning, we got mixed reviews. We were doing something that no one had done before. We commissioned almost all of our programmes out. A lot of our staff hadn’t even worked in TV before. I remember getting into constant battles with our engineering colleagues. There were some bumpy rides. But we came through it all. Plus, we didn’t have to pay for cups of tea on the trolley, like we did at the BBC. We had a kitchen with a coffee grinder and everything. I loved The Tube. [Host] Paula Yates was amazing. She was so funny and cool and confident. So when I got a phone call asking me to cover for her when she was on her maternity leave, I said yes straight away – even though I knew nothing about music, and I had no experience of live TV. Waiting for the show to come on air, I’d go like jelly. Because it was such a new channel, we had no commercials: everything would just cut to black. It was all so new and weird and exciting. Channel 4 was really hip. It felt like you were in a band. It felt like our channel. It belonged to young people. If you weren’t cool, you shouldn’t be watching it. Channel 4 still feels different. If you watch BBC and ITV, they are so careful about everything. Working on The Tube, we had the most amazing artists: the Pretenders, Wham!, Bananarama – they were really mean to me, actually, but we’re friends now – Johnny Rotten, Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox. I was terrified of Annie. I dried up completely. But she ended up interviewing me, which was so kind of her. I remember Jools [Holland] swearing and getting banned for an episode. I think the bosses secretly thought it was cool. And I always remember interviewing McCartney. I was staring at him, thinking: “Fuck, it’s Paul McCartney!” All my questions went out of my head. He had an album out called Pipes of Peace. I ended up calling it Pipes of Piss by mistake. Thankfully, he thought it was funny.

4/19/2022,"Christmas 2015 was a miserable one for the 1,000 employees of Leicester-based Mark Group who had lost their jobs with the energy efficiency company just weeks before. The business, named Britain’s fastest-growing in a prestigious list published just two years earlier, had become a casualty of then prime minister David Cameron’s environmental flip-flopping, which saw him oscillate from hugging a husky to issuing a pledge to “cut the green crap”. A wave of state-funded schemes helping homeowners to patch up draughty homes had been replaced in 2013 with the deeply flawed green deal, which was eventually killed off in summer 2015. Companies in the sector shrank or folded in the face of a sudden dearth of customers able to afford improvements. The annual number of installations of cavity wall and loft insulations has fallen from more than 2m to barely a tenth of that today. “Helping people [laid-off employees] carry personal belongings to their cars brings it home to you,” says Mark Group’s chief commercial officer Bill Rumble. “You’re not sure what to say when they close the boot.” It’s not rocket science,” says David Adams, of the UK Green Building Council, who witnessed the insulation industry’s rapid decay. “If the market reduces by three-quarters, you have to take three-quarters of your capacity out. Some will close and to a significant extent they have not rehired because activity has remained low since.” Boris Johnson has fared little better than Cameron. His Green Homes Grant for England was introduced in summer 2020 only to be axed six months later. It was branded a “slam dunk fail”. Meanwhile, upgrades made under the Energy Companies Obligation system have risen and fallen as short-term schemes ended, never fuelling a return to the pre-2013 glory days. The UK’s piecemeal attitude to patching up its energy inefficient homes – among the leakiest in Europe – is back in the spotlight after the government’s energy security strategy, published earlier this month, was criticised for failing to include any new measures on insulation. The government has said it wants as many homes as possible to be upgraded from energy efficiency band D to C by 2035 but Adams does not see where that shift will come from. “There are no policies for delivering it,” he says. “It’s simply words.” Meanwhile, the Italian government is effectively paying its citizens to upgrade their homes, offering 110% on the cost of installing insulation systems, heat pumps and solar panels or replacing an old boiler. It has cost about £17.5bn so far. Labour has criticised the lack of action on the issue as “shameful” and has offered its own pledge, costed at £60bn over 10 years, to fund the upgrade of 2m homes in the first year. That is double the rate that even the insulation-friendly Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) thinktank has proposed, but Labour insists it can be done with sufficient investment. Dr Simon Cran-McGreehin, of the ECIU, anticipates significant challenges, not least reanimating an industry that was badly beaten down a decade ago and has had only scraps to feed off. “The industry is severely jaded and wounded from all the changes,” he says. “The rug was pulled out in 2013 and they laid off thousands of people. “The industry made an effort for no real return. So getting them to upsize now would need good long-term commitment and a programme that was really viable.” You cannot get the staff these days either, according to Prof Sir Jim McDonald, president of the Royal Academy of Engineering. He estimates that 30,000 new skilled workers would be required to retrofit buildings, while 60,000 technicians would have to be on hand to go one step further and install energy efficient heating systems in homes, offices and factories, with intensive training required. “The ability to fill vacancies in these highly technical fields is restricted by the UK’s stagnating levels of engineering skills over the past decade,” he says. Adams thinks the industry can rise to the challenge but that “fatigue” after years of broken promises means it could only do so in response to a bold and ambitious long-term strategy. “What we don’t need it is a one or two-year programme again. They’re incredibly inefficient. You’ve got to hire and train people, buy loads of kit and then you end up having to lay them off again.” It is hard to see where the insulation revolution is coming from. The only new measure on the table is a VAT cut – from 5% to 0% – on installing solar panels and energy efficiency materials, a welcome but small-scale measure announced in Rishi Sunak’s spring statement rather than the energy strategy. That, says James Higgins, of the National Insulation Association, is “not a gamechanger”. The NIA has been supportive of government measures that do exist for funding home upgrades, particularly for the poorest households, but envisages more ambitious thinking. The big challenge, says Higgins, is not simply returning to the high levels of cavity wall and loft insulation that were going on prior to Cameron’s 2013 U-turn, but the 9m homes that could benefit from more expensive solid wall insulation. “What we need as a country is to look at homes in the round and say what do they need to be compatible with net zero. “It’s insulation but not just walls; there’s roof space, underfloor, draft exclusion, doors and windows. The whole house retrofit is the future but it’s a massive job.” A chart produced by parliament’s climate change committee illustrates the eye-watering costs involved in implementing the most effective measures. Nearly 11m homes are suitable for loft insulation, it says, at a cost of between £440 and £740 each. That’s £8bn for a 4% reduction in heat demand for a semi-detached home. An 18% reduction could be achieved with external wall insulation but that would cost up to £8,590 per home, or nearly £65bn. With relations between Sunak and the business and energy minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, strained, it is hard to envisage the Treasury opening the purse strings for the most ambitious projects, even spread over a decade. Insulation advocates think there are mechanisms that could complement direct government support, harnessing market forces to incentivise homeowners to spend their own money. Ideas include council tax discounts for people who upgrade the energy efficiency of their home, or a sliding scale of stamp duty, with leaky homes taxed more highly but a rebate available for homeowners who make improvements within two years of buying. “It means there’s no free money,” says Adams. “But it does encourage you to think about what needs to be done.”",News/Environment,Where Britain’s journey to insulation went wrong,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/19/where-britains-journey-to-insulation-went-wrong
4/19/2022,"Labour has said it would insulate 2m houses within a year to slash bills and reduce reliance on Russian gas, accusing Boris Johnson of a “shameful” failure to stop Britain’s homes leaking heat. The government put major nuclear and onshore wind projects at the heart of its energy security strategy announced earlier this month, but faced criticism for failing to include any new measures on insulation despite the UK having some of the draughtiest housing in Europe. The shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said that, if elected, Labour would aim for 2m household upgrades in the first year of a decade-long £60bn scheme that could save households £400 on bills annually. “As families face the steepest rise in energy bills on record, it is shameful that Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are refusing to take the action needed to help them,” he said. Miliband said one reason for sky-high bills was “12 years of failure” to back energy efficiency upgrades, which have dwindled from nearly 2.5m a year to a tenth of that, after funding cuts that followed David Cameron’s 2013 pledge to “cut the green crap”. “Insulating as many homes as possible to cut bills, protect our pensioners, and reduce our dependence on Russian gas must now be an urgent priority,” said Miliband, adding that Labour would make energy efficiency a “national mission”. He said this could cut average bills, which are on track to soar to more than £2,500 later this year, by up to £400, as well as eliminating Russian gas imports and supporting jobs. “If this government were serious about cutting people’s bills, it could start right now, insulating 2m homes this year,” he said. “Anything less will damage our energy security and leave families to pay the cost.” The chief executive of the UK’s second largest energy supplier, E.ON, has argued that the failure to back insulation projects “condemns thousands more customers to living in cold and draughty homes, wasting energy and paying more than they need to for their heating”. Meanwhile, Italy has already spend £17.5bn on a 110% tax credit for people who install insulation systems, heat pumps and solar panels, or replace an old boiler or undertake works that reduce the risk of damage from seismic activity. A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is exactly why we have set out a generous £22bn package of support, and the energy price cap continues to insulate millions of customers from volatile global gas prices. “We have an excellent record on insulation, with the energy company obligation alone delivering around 3.4m measures in 2.4m homes since 2013. “We are building on that record by already investing over £6.6bn to decarbonise homes and buildings, and bringing in higher minimum performance standards to ensure all homes meet EPC band C by 2035.”",News/Business,Labour says it will insulate 2m houses in first year to cut bills,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/labour-says-it-will-insulate-2m-houses-in-first-year-to-cut-bills
4/19/2022,"In the UK, we are witnessing the “decriminalisation of rape” and as a result, more and more women are having to find alternative ways to access justice. In the year to September 2021, police in England and Wales were told of 63,136 allegations of rape, but only 820 alleged rapists were charged: the prosecution rate for rape was just 1.3%. As a result, more and more rape victims are turning to the civil courts for some semblance of justice. Unlike in the criminal courts, those found to be rapists do not receive a criminal record or time in jail. Instead the judge can issue a “finding” of rape and issue a financial “award” for victims (although enforcing an order for damages can be an uphill struggle against a defendant who is, or claims to be, impoverished). In a criminal court, the state must establish that the jury “are satisfied so that they are sure”, the defendant raped the complainant, but in the civil court, the standard of proof is lower, the claimant must prove the defendant raped her on the balance of probabilities (51% likely). The process is not without hardship. The burden is on a traumatised victim to bring a claim within a narrow time limit, pay for it and wait (sometimes) years to conclude. Some victims don’t have any resources or power to access the civil courts. Victims do not have the same legal powers as the police to gather evidence. Despite the difficulties, a finding of rape by a judge can give closure to victims. After Ms M’s rapist was acquitted at a Scottish criminal trial (that she described as “abysmal”), she won £80,000 in damages against him at a civil trial in 2018. She said: “It was never about the money, it was about the law acknowledging what Stephen Coxen did to me was wrong and against the law.” These victories, however, are few and far between, as some perpetrators buy their way out of justice by settling the claim and paying the victim off, before it even reaches a trial. The data suggests a general settlement rate of 96% to 97% of civil claims in UK county courts. In 2011, Denise Clair reported two former Scotland football players, David Goodwillie and David Robertson, to the Scottish police for rape but the criminal case was dropped due to insufficient evidence. In a civil claim in 2017, she won a finding of rape and £100,000 in damages. Such an amount would be a drop in the ocean for the rich and powerful. Some women are instead turning to private prosecutions (when a private individual rather than the CPS takes a case to criminal court). Unlike civil claims, private prosecutions result in the same criminal punishment upon conviction as public prosecutions. But the director of public prosecutions (DPP) has the power to take over a private prosecution and either continue it or end it, and in some cases, the private prosecutor must seek the consent of the DPP or attorney general before commencing proceedings. The average cost of a private prosecution is about £8,500. It’s not just rape complainants looking for alternative justice: domestic abuse victims are also taking matters into their own hands. Earlier this year, a husband who, among other things, failed to grant his wife a Jewish religious divorce was convicted of coercive or controlling behaviour after his wife brought a private prosecution against him. While it is positive that victims have the power to bring private prosecutions, many survivors do not have the resources to do so. The state has a duty to bring perpetrators to account rather than putting the onus on victims. The philosopher Kate Manne has described a culture of “himpathy”, which is inappropriate or disproportionate sympathy towards male perpetrators of sexual violence over their female victims, who are erased in the process. Himpathy means worrying about his bright future rather than her suffering. She is right. In one case, in which a soldier was accused of raping a woman he met in a Dundee nightclub, the victim claimed that the jury in the criminal trial were told to think about the impact their verdict would have on his military career. When the victim brought a claim in the civil court, where there was no risk of a criminal record, the judge made a finding of rape. There is a genuine question as to whether rape has become decriminalised in part because society doesn’t believe the crime justifies “ruining” a rapist’s life. Rape should be treated as seriously by the state as terrorism: it is an invasion of (usually) women’s autonomy by men using domination. Instead it has become a “problem” that can potentially be solved with a chequebook.

4/19/2022,"The Royal British Legion has apologised for its historical refusal to acknowledge the sacrifices of LGBTQ+ British military personnel. For decades, campaigners have accused the organisation of homophobia, claiming it sought to erase LGBTQ+ people’s contributions to British war efforts and to actively oppose queer remembrance efforts. Now, in a letter seen exclusively by the Guardian, the organisation has tried to make amends. The note came in response to correspondence from the human rights activist Peter Tatchell, who reminded the Royal British Legion (RBL) late last year that he had written to it back in 2007 to complain about the same stance. But, he said, it had declined even to answer. “I am deeply saddened by your previous experience with the charity, and I can only apologise on RBL’s behalf for not responding and the discrimination shown at the time,” the charity’s director general, Charles Byrne, wrote to Tatchell last week. In the 2007 letter, the human rights activist said the RBL had accused his organisation OutRage! of “making political capital” out of Remembrance Sunday after its members laid a pink triangle wreath at the Cenotaph. “Our observance of queer remembrance day was, you say, in ‘bad taste’. Who does the British Legion think it is? It is sheer arrogance for you to criticise and demean our act of remembrance. The gay community has as much right to honour its members who fought for freedom as the Black and Jewish communities, both of which pay respect to their war dead without being vilified by the British Legion.” He said the RBL lacked the “decency to acknowledge the contribution of queer soldiers, sailors and aircrews to the allied victory over Hitlerism”, adding that the organisation refused to “officially admit that any homosexuals fought in the last war, let alone that some of them acquitted themselves with distinction”. Finally addressing the concerns 15 years later, Byrne – who became the director general in 2016 – said the RBL had “very much changed”. He added: “The behaviour you outline of the RBL of the past is not tolerated in today’s organisation.” A ban on gay people serving in the armed forces was lifted in 2000. Yet OutRage! claimed that an unwillingness to acknowledge the gay and lesbian people who served nevertheless persisted. In 1999, Tatchell and his colleagues followed the main remembrance ceremony with a special service honouring LGBTQ+ personnel. In 2007 – the same year his letter to the RBL went unanswered – the Ministry of Defence apologised to all gay service personnel who faced persecution and discrimination before 2000. Responding to Byrne’s letter, Tatchell said: “Our praise and thanks to the Legion for eschewing its homophobic past with this forthright and fulsome apology. We are delighted by its commitment to support LGBT+ veterans and work with the LGBT+ community. “This draws a line under the pain of the RBL’s previous prejudice and discrimination. LGBT+ people can now confidently collaborate with the RBL, knowing that they are on our side.”",News/World news,Royal British Legion apologises for past LGBTQ+ discrimination,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/royal-british-legion-apologises-for-past-lgbtq-discrimination
4/19/2022,"G20 countries are being urged by a group of renowned economists to use the crackdown on oligarchs’ wealth amid Ukraine sanctions as a spur to tackle tax havens once and for all. An open letter sent to the 20 finance ministers before they meet on Tuesday called on them to implement a global register to link assets, companies and structures to their owners so they could no longer deprive countries of what they owed. Its 14 signatories – all commissioners of anti-tax avoidance group the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT) – include the economists Gabriel Zucman, Joseph Stiglitz and Thomas Piketty, as well as the French investigative judge Eva Joly. They argued that the concentration of extreme wealth hidden in tax havens was increasing inequality and impoverishing the poorest in society, and demanded reform of an international financial system that was “skewed in favour of wealthy tax abusers”. Since the start of the pandemic, the world’s richest people have seen their wealth double to $1.5tn (£1.01tn), yet the ICRICT commissioners found the gap between rich and poor had only widened during that time, a situation that had been exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine and had left many of the poorest facing a cost of living crisis and soaring energy and food bills. They wrote that members of the global elite often hid their wealth “through elaborate structures to avoid paying taxes, but also to hide money generated by corruption and illegal activities … Global finance allows tax abuses, corruption and money laundering to flourish.” Attempts to sanction assets belonging to Russian oligarchs after Vladimir Putin’s invasion had highlighted what the signatories caled the “wall of opacity” over where their wealth was held, causing difficulties for nations looking to impose penalties on those with links to the Kremlin. The letter read: “The war in Ukraine shows that we need to tackle tax havens head-on now, by implementing transparency measures as a matter of urgency. It is about targeting all oligarchs, and all forms of wealth hidden from the tax authorities and the public in general and hidden in jurisdictions with high levels of financial opacity.” Some progress in linking wealth to its real owners had been made in recent years, according to the group, including the automatic exchange of financial account information, and the introduction of national registries of beneficial ownership. However, they said previous developments had lacked “political will”, prompting them to urge the G20 countries to do more. Huge leaks of documents – including the Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers, and most recently Suisse Secrets – have highlighted the activities of wealthy individuals and companies, and their use of offshore tax havens. However, despite the resulting pressure on governments to take tougher action on tax, activists say little progress has been made to crack down on their use. The ICRICT economists proposed the introduction of an international network of asset registries that listed all different forms of wealth: from assets including property, yachts, jets and jewellery; to bank accounts, cryptocurrency assets and safe deposit boxes; as well as trusts and other legal arrangements; and even intangible assets such as intellectual property and trademarks. These would be linked to their actual, beneficial owners, who may be different to their legal owners. The economists said a global asset registry that detailed what was owned where and by whom would enable countries to record and analyse wealth and inequality and would lead to greater enforcement of tax laws while hindering those who wanted to pursue illicit activities. The commissioners urge G20 leaders to convene an urgent international summit to implement such a system and discuss offshore wealth and tax havens. “No more excuses, no more pandemics, no more wars to justify lack of action,” they sign off, concluding that such action was required “to preserve democracy, end spiralling inequality and rebuild the social contract”.",News/World news,G20 ministers urged to use oligarch crackdown to tackle tax havens,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/g20-ministers-urged-to-use-oligarch-crackdown-to-tackle-tax-havens
4/19/2022,"The billowing black smoke that has cloaked the US Pacific north-west during wildfire disasters in past years has caused atmospheric carbon monoxide levels to spike, with the contaminants offsetting recent reductions in emissions, scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research have found. As the American west faces increasing threats from big blazes that are fueled by a climate that’s growing warmer and drier, researchers have documented the impact of smoke on public health. But scientists are increasingly finding that the fires may be part of a feedback loop that could accelerate the change in conditions and that health impacts officials have long warned would worsen with climate crisis, may in fact already be here. “Our research contributes to the growing body of research that shows that fires – in particular Pacific north-west region fires – are becoming more important for North American air quality” said Dr Rebecca Buchholz, a project scientist at National Center for Atmospheric Research. Looking at carbon monoxide, a trace gas emitted during fires, researchers analyzed the impact on atmospheric chemistry from 2002 to 2018, Buchholz explained. Though the scientists relied on carbon monoxide data to guide them, the contaminant also provided a framework to understand how other sources of pollution might be tied to the flames. Her team, which also included scientists from across the country and around the globe, found that the dangerous pollutant peaks in August when fires are typically raging in the region, but dips during other months. The deviation from the annual cycle, she said, “is telling us that fires are compromising the ability of the atmosphere to self-clean”. Globally, carbon monoxide concentrations receded by half a percentage point a year over the 16-year study period. But across North America, the scientists found that August was an outlier. Carbon monoxide levels in the atmosphere follow a seasonal flow, driven to ebb and increase through a photochemical process. Prior to 2011, the regions fell in line with this pattern and levels of the pollutants peaked in the spring and waned in late summer. In a more recent period the researchers analyzed, from 2012-2018, a new trend began to emerge. In August – when CO was expected to be driven to its lowest points – there were instead spikes. The scientists found that this not only affects atmospheric carbon monoxide, but was found closer to the Earth’s surface as well. The deviation from the worldwide trend was strongest in the Pacific north-west, where wildfire risks are high during that month, but the effect lingered in data collected in areas across the country and into the north-east of the North American continent. The study’s findings were supported by four different global fire emission inventories, which consistently showed carbon monoxide fire emissions peaked in the Pacific north-west in August. Data from two other inventories that catalog emissions from human activity show carbon monoxide was not increasing in the region during the study period, helping the researchers rule out other causes of the August surge and its spread. A growing body of research has shown how wildfires raging across the west can impact the air locally and afar, with the potential to affect millions across the country. Last year the sun glowed ominously red as far away as New York City, shrouded in haze from land burning on the other side of the country. In 2020, which had the worst wildfire season on record, levels of the most dangerous type of air pollution rose by 7% in the US even after the pandemic shutdowns delivered steep reductions in fossil fuel use. The toxic output from fires is dangerous, contributing to an estimated loss of more than 15,000 lives in the US each year. Some scientists say that number will double by the end of the century. Smoke from western fires has also been attributed to up to 5,900 asthma-related emergency department visits a year, according to a separate study published last year. Nearly three-quarters of these visits and hospital admissions tied to smoke inhalation were outside the western US. While some questions still remain about the connection between ignitions and climate crisis, it’s clear that spiking temperatures are spurring the desiccation of landscapes and priming them to burn. Fires are still predominantly caused by people. Land management, including the use of prescribed fire – which doesn’t burn with the same amount of intensity or smoke – plays an important role in mitigating the potential for disasters. But as the west warms, bigger blazes are expected to follow. This study shows that this could have a more lasting effect. “There is definitely a feedback between fires and climate,” researcher Buchholz said, noting that big questions about the specifics of the relationship between the two still remain. But her research shows that the conflagrations have a compounding effect on bad air quality and that it has the potential to affect millions across the continent. It will be important to start looking at August as a significantly changing month when it comes to contaminants, she said.",News/US news,Wildfire smoke in Pacific north-west erasing reductions in emissions – study,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/18/wildfire-smoke-emissions-study-pacific-north-west
4/19/2022,"Next time you’re considering a passionate embrace, you might want to consult your partner’s dental records. A Houston dentist is confronting TikTok with a brutal truth: you can get cavities from kissing the wrong person. “Thinking about the kiss I gave my husband even though he has cavities,” Dr Tasneem Mahmood writes in her video, captioned: “And that’s on cavities being contagious.” The clip has been viewed more than a million times. It seems bizarre – how could a void in your tooth result in a similar crater in the mouth of a lover? But to dentists, it’s not exactly breaking news. Experts have been aware of the transmissibility of tooth decay since at least the 1970s, according to Dr John Featherstone, professor emeritus and former dean of the School of Dentistry at the University of California, San Francisco. Decay is linked to the presence of certain bacterial strains in our mouths, and that bacteria can be exchanged between people through the saliva – by, say, kissing. In 2011, a dentist told the New York Times about a patient in her 40s who had never had a cavity – until she started seeing a guy who hadn’t visited the dentist in 18 years. Featherstone, who has spent four decades investigating the management of tooth decay, has seen similar cases in his own research. But the bacteria don’t do the job on their own. “The second absolutely essential thing for tooth decay is frequent ingestion of what we call fermentable carbohydrates. So sucrose, glucose, fructose, high fructose corn syrup and bread for that matter,” Featherstone says. The bacteria feed on the carbohydrates that we unwittingly provide for them, and they produce acid in the process. This acid dissolves the calcium phosphate in our teeth and leads to decay. So even if your partner does give you some of these bacteria, you can improve your odds of staying healthy by following good dental practices. That includes avoiding excessive ingestion of these risky carbohydrates, maintaining “very low frequency of ingestion of sugars during the day in between meals”, Featherstone says. It also means “brushing twice a day with a fluoride-containing toothpaste”. (Here’s a much more detailed account of Featherstone’s findings, aimed at providers but with useful information for patients.) “Most of us have these decay-producing bacteria in our mouths,” says Featherstone. “I do. And I don’t have tooth decay – I haven’t had it for decades.” That doesn’t mean we should let dental nightmares stop us from expressing love, Featherstone says. “Kissing is a really good way to pass on any disease from one to another. So I think it’s very important not to say that kissing is bad, because it’s part of humans’ activity.” Mahmood agrees, telling Insider she isn’t advising against kissing people with cavities. “Not at all,” she tells the site. “Having cavities is not a moral failing.” Still, Featherstone says, “be careful if your partner has lots and lots of decay. They are going to transmit to you.” You’ll need to take extra care with your hygiene. “So if your partner is loaded with active decay, do send them to a dentist and get it fixed.”",News/Society,A TikTok dentist says cavities are contagious – is the viral claim true?,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/19/are-cavities-contagious-tiktok-dentist
4/19/2022,"Tuesday marks 1,000 days since Boris Johnson first began working in Downing Street on 24 July 2019. When he came to power, many warned that UK was in for a bumpy ride. He promised to defy the “the doubters, the doomsters and the gloomsters”, but since then his premiership has exceeded even the gloomiest, most doom-laden fears of his doubters and detractors. Here is a list of some of the most notable scandals, U-turns and examples of law breaking. Unlawfully proroguing parliament The supreme court unanimously ruled that Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament at the height of Brexit crisis was unlawful. In a devastating judgment, Lady Hale, the president of the court, said the move was “unlawful, void and of no effect”. Purge of senior Tory MPs Johnson removed the whip from 21 senior Tories who defied the government by voting to delay Brexit to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a deal. The prime minister’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, who was believed to be behind the move, was quoted as saying: “When are you fucking MPs going to realise we are leaving on 31 October? We are going to purge you.” Former lover Jennifer Arcuri awarded cash and access The Sunday Times revealed that US business woman Jennifer Arcuri was given tens of thousands of pounds in public funds and access to overseas trade missions led by Johnson during his time as mayor of London. Johnson made no mention of Arcuri in his lists of interests as mayor, and claimed was no interest to declare. But Arcuri later allege that she had an affair with Johnson. He avoided a criminal investigation into the funds and favours granted to Arcuri, but the Independent Office for Police Conduct found evidence that officials were influenced by the close relationship between the pair. The IOPC investigations are ongoing and Johnson has denied misconduct in public office. Attempting to use public money to attack LabourJohnson’s administration was blocked from attempting to use the civil service to rubbish Labour’s spending plans before the December 2019 election. The permanent secretary, Mark Sedwill, ruled that the publication of Treasury analysis before the 12 December poll would be improper. Hiding in a fridge Johnson was caught hiding in a fridge in Pudsey, West Yorkshire, to avoid being interviewed by ITV’s Piers Morgan on the eve of the election. He also refused to be interviewed by the BBC’s Andrew Neil ahead of the election. Leaving Brexit unresolvedAs promised in the election the UK formally left the EU on 31 January. But Brexit is far from done. Unresolved rows rumble on over UK imports, fishing, and the Northern Ireland border. Fatally slow response to Covid Medical experts believe that 20,000 deaths from Covid could have avoided if Johnson had not delayed the decision to introduce the first lockdown. The prime minister skipped the first five Cobra meetings about the virus and boasted of shaking hands with medical staff on his first hospital visit to a Covid ward. Backs Cummings over lockdown breaches The Guardian and the Daily Mirror reveal that Dominic Cummings breached lockdown rules by travelling to Durham and Barnard Castle with his family after they contracted Covid. The revelations prompt widespread anger, including among dozens of Tory MPs, and the first accusation that the government is operating by different rules from the rest of the country. ‘Chumocracy’ Covid contracts Appointments and millions of pounds worth of PPE and Covid-related contracts were awarded to individuals and companies with links to the Conservative party. The High Court later ruled that the VIP lane for awarding PPE contracts was illegal. The government insisted that circumventing the usual procurement rules allowed it to act quickly in national emergency. U-turn on school meal vouchers Johnson’s government had refused to provide £15 food vouchers for some of England’s poorest families, but was forced into a humiliating U-turn after a campaign launched by the footballer Marcus Rashford. Test-and-trace failures Johnson promised a “world beating” test-and-trace system for tackling coronavirus in England. Instead the £12bn scheme was dogged by delays, IT problems, expensive contracts and proved only to have a “marginal impact”. Planning reform prompts Tory revolt Johnson’s government proposes tearing up the planning system by tipping the balance of power in favour of developers and away from local objectors. The plans cause outrage in the Tory heartlands, and were seen as the main cause of the loss of the previously safe Tory seat in the Chesham and Amersham byelection 10 months later. Exams U-turnIn a humiliating change of policy the UK government abandoned a controversial computer modelling system for assessing the exam grades after thousands of stories of unfairly awarded grades. Gavin Williamson, 12 August, to ITV “[I have] every confidence that the system we have put in place is a robust system, a system that’s fair” Gavin Williamson, 12 August, to the BBC “The system, for the overwhelming majority of young people, is going to deliver credible, strong results. It’s a robust system, it’s a fair system, it’s making sure that young people get the grades that they’ve worked so hard towards” Nick Gibb, 12 August, to Sky News “Most young people … will get the grade that the teacher sent in to the exam board that they thought they would get.” Gavin Williamson, 13 August, to Sky News Q) “Can you give a cast-iron guarantee that you will not be forced into the embarrassing U-turn that John Swinney and Nicola Sturgeon were in Scotland?”A) ""Absolutely"" Boris Johnson, 13 August, to reporters in Northern Ireland “Let’s be in no doubt about it, the exam results that we’ve got today are robust. They’re good, they’re dependable for employers. It’s very important that for years to come people should be able to look at these grades and think these are robust, these are dependable” Gavin Williamson, 15 August, interview to the Times “This is it… No U-turn, no change… [In Scotland] you’ve got a system where there aren’t any controls, you’ve got rampant grade inflation. There’s been no checks and balances in that system; it degrades every single grade as a result and in-baked unfairness”  Attempting to break international law The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, admits that plans to reinterpret the Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland will break international law “in a very specific and limited way”. The move was eventually abandoned after the resignation of the UK’s top legal civil servant, Jonathan Jones, and a mutiny in the House of Lords by a gang of former Tory party leaders. Evgeny Lebedev given peerage despite security concerns Johnson gives a peerage to the Russian tycoon Evgeny Lebedev despite the concerns of the security services. Johnson was warned that Lebedev could be a potential security risk because his father, Alexander Lebedev, was once a KGB spy. The media owner dismissed the concerns as farcical. ‘Get Covid live longer’Johnson was holding out against lockdown measures and appear to suggest he was unconcerned by the deaths of people in their 80s, according to WhatsApp messaged released by his former aide Cummings. A message quoted the prime minister as saying: “I must say I have been slightly rocked by some of the data on Covid fatalities. The median age is 82 – 81 for men, 85 for women. That is above life expectancy. So get Covid and live longer.” ‘Let the bodies pile high’ After he left No 10, Cummings alleged that Johnson resisted advice to introduce a second lockdown with the words: “no more fucking lockdowns – let the bodies pile high in their thousands”. Despite corroboration from several other sources, Downing Street denied Johnson uttered those words. Second U-turn child food povertyAfter weeks resisting calls to extend free school meals to children from low-income families during school holidays in England, the government performed another screeching U-turn. Johnson’s ethics adviser quits in protestJohnson’s ethics adviser, Sir Alex Allan, resigned after the prime minister ripped up the rulebook by refusing to sack Priti Patel despite a formal investigation finding evidence that she bullied civil servants. ‘Cancel Christmas’ Johnson is accused of cancelling Christmas after suddenly abandoning plans to avoid tight Covid restrictions over the festive period. The U-turn prompts an immediate backlash from lockdown sceptic backbenchers. ‘Pork barrel’ spendingThe government is accused of “pork barrel politics” after towns fund cash is awarded almost exclusively to Tory supporting areas. All but six of the 45 towns granted cash in the first tranche of the scheme were represented by Conservative MPs. ‘Matter closed’ after Hancock apologises for kissing an aide Johnson initially resisted calls to sack his health secretary Matt Hancock after he was caught on camera kissing his aide Gina Coladangelo in breach of social distancing rules. After Hancock apologies, Downing Street said it considered the “matter closed”. But a day later, after mounting anger, Johnson dismissed Hancock and tried to claim credit for acting decisively. Manifesto busting cut to foreign aidJohnson’s manifesto pledge to keep foreign aid at 0.7% of national income is scrapped despite opposition from senior government backbenchers. ‘Pilot scheme’ to dodge self isolation Johnson and Rishi Sunak initially tried to avoid the need to self-isolate after they were were both ‘pinged’ when a colleague contracted Covid. They said they were participating in a trial scheme to allow them to continue to work if they had daily tests. They backed down within three hours after widespread criticism. Travel restrictions ditched after chaosJohnson ditches plans for tougher quarantine restrictions for some holidaymakers after days of travel chaos. A cabinet revolt and a backlash from the travel industry forced the abandonment of planned amber watchlist to warn travellers which countries were at risk of turning red because of high Covid infection rates. Johnson ‘authorised’ rescue of pets from Kabul Two foreign office whistleblowers alleged Johnson ordered the prioritisation of the Nowzad animal charity based in Afghanistan during the evacuation of Kabul. Johnson has denied that he had anything to do with the decision. Josie Stewart, who worked in the Foreign Office for seven years, suggested senior civil servants in the department had lied to cover up the embarrassing episode. Pensions triple lock abandonedThe government ditches its manifesto promise of a pensions triple lock, by announcing the commitment will be suspended to avoid the government having to hike payments by 8%. Manifesto-breaking hike in National Insurance Johnson forces through another manifesto-breaking plan to increase in National Insurance to pay for a £12bn fund for the NHS and social care. He avoids a significant rebellion by springing a vote on MPs with just 24 hours’ notice. The increase from 12% to 13.5% was introduced in April 2022, adding to the cost of living crisis. Supply crisis prompts emergency visasPanic buying prompted by a post-Brexit shortage of lorry drivers and farm workers prompts the government to hastily compiled plans to add 5,000 HGV drivers and 5,500 poultry workers to its visa scheme. Later immigration rules were also relaxed for care workers to fill another chronic workforce gap. Paterson lobbying scandal Johnson’s botched attempt to shield his friend and former minister, Owen Paterson, from suspension for lobbying rule breaches prompts 100 Tory MPs to rebel. The prime minister reversed the plan 24 hours later forcing Paterson to resign and engulfing the government in accusation of sleaze. The Liberal Democrats win the resulting byelection in Paterson’s previously safe Tory seat of North Shropshire. Peppa Pig speechJohnson prompts questions about his welfare after delivering a rambling speech to business leaders in which he lost his his place for 20 seconds, praised Peppa Pig, compared himself to Moses and made car noises. ‘Misleading’ Geidt over flat makeoverJohnson is accused of misleading his second ethics adviser, Lord Geidt, over the source of funding for the makeover Downing Street flat. The Electoral Commission fined the Conservative party £17,800. But it also suggested he gave differing accounts to investigators looking into the redecoration. Almost £900,000 spent on Northern Ireland bridge planThe Department for Transport reveals that £896,681 of taxpayers money was spent on a study commissioned by Boris Johnson that found his idea to build a tunnel between Scotland and Northern Ireland would be too expensive. Cummings described the idea as “world’s most stupid tunnel”. Johnson and Sunak fined over Partygate Johnson becomes the first sitting prime minister to be criminally sanctioned when he is given a £50 fixed penalty notice for breaking his own Covid laws by attending a party for his birthday in No 10. The chancellor and Carrie Johnson are also fined.",News/Politics,"From prorogation to partygate: 1,000 days of Boris Johnson as PM",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/19/1000-days-of-boris-johnson-as-prime-minister-proroguing-parliament-partygate
4/19/2022,"The Liberal party’s controversial candidate for the seat of Warringah, Katherine Deves, claimed a key role in developing legislation to exclude trans women from women’s sport that has been slammed by equality advocates as “divisive and unnecessary”. Speaking at an event organised by a group called the Coalition for Biological Reality on the issue of “gender identity in law” in Hobart in February, Deves claimed she had worked with the Tasmanian senator Claire Chandler on developing the controversial “Save Women’s Sport” bill. “Here we are in less than 18 months [since] we started this campaign there is a bill tabled in federal parliament to clarify and preserve our rights,” she said at the event, at which Chandler also spoke. “And we did this with nothing more than determination, grit and a bit of courage, and of course the indomitable Senator Chandler.” Before her preselection, Deves founded the advocacy group Save Women’s Sport Australasia, which campaigns against the inclusion of trans athletes in women’s sport. She has praised Chandler as a “marvel” and said she stood “proudly” with the Tasmanian senator in defending the “rights of little girls, young women and women everywhere”. During the first week of the campaign she was forced to issue two separate apologises over a series of comments made before her preselection, including labelling Wear it Purple Day as a “grooming tactic” which promoted “extreme body modification”, describing trans children as “surgically mutilated and sterilised” and comparing her activism to standing up against the Holocaust. The revelation comes as the prime minister, Scott Morrison, resists calls to dump Deves, after Guardian Australia reported on Monday that the Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman had contacted the prime minister’s office seeking her disendorsement. Speaking in Perth on Tuesday, Morrison said he would not join in the “pile-on” against Deves, and praised her advocacy for women in sport. “In selecting Katherine I have selected someone … who is a woman raising three girls, who has always stood up for women and girls in sport, and I’m not going to allow a pile-on, on her, to silence her, and I think there are many Australians who agree with me about that,” Morrison said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The New South Wales treasurer and senior moderate, Matt Kean, earlier on Tuesday called for her to be dumped, saying he did not believe “she’s fit for office”. “I do not believe that she is aligned with the values of the Liberal party,” Kean told ABC’s Radio National on Tuesday. “We live in a cosmopolitan, multicultural society where people are free to be themselves and that’s a fundamental tenet of liberalism.” Deves had little factional support before the federal intervention into the NSW Liberal party in March, and sources within the state executive have described her as a “captain’s pick” by Morrison. But that support has angered moderates in NSW, who are fighting off serious challenges in the neighbouring seats of Wentworth and North Sydney. Zimmerman had privately called on Morrison last week to dump Deves amid concern that her anti-trans record could undermine his campaign in North Sydney against an independent challenger, Kylea Tink. Dave Sharma, who is facing a similar contest in Wentworth from the high-profile independent Allegra Spender, is also under pressure over Deves’ remarks, but has so far refused to comment on whether she should be disendorsed.

During a speech last month to a group called Women’s Declaration, which advocates for sex-based rights, Deves accused the MPs of causing “brazen disarray” by opposing the bill. “In 2019 it couldn’t have been plainer that the religious discrimination bill was part of the legislative omnibus for the Morrison government,” she said. “Those who ran as endorsed candidates for the Liberal party campaigned expressly or implicitly for the RDA. That was part of the party’s campaign platform. Yet five Liberal party members crossed the floor.” Stating she had “absolute support for a proper conscience vote”, Deves criticised the MPs for, she claimed, failing to debate the changes in the Liberal party room. “That is where these issues are ironed out so when legislation is brought to parliament the concerns have been voiced [and are] better thought out and better planned, rather than MPs crossing the floor in the middle of the night on amendments moved by the Centre Alliance party,” she said. Deves claimed trans children had been “confused and misled by identity politics”, were likely to be gay or lesbian, and that opposing the bill was playing “the game of wilfully pretend that they are the opposite sex”. “The strange thing is those five members crossing the floor did so because they believed it was discriminating against trans kids,” she said. “Traumatised girls abandoning womanhood. Kids who are gender non-conforming [and] likely to grow up to be gay or lesbian convinced they were born in the wrong sex and have the wrong body seeking refuge from a highly gendered society that was actually doing quite well in accepting gender non-conformity. “So how does it serve these kids to push them down a medicalised path or play the game of wilfully pretending that they are the opposite sex? How does that help them?” Chandler’s bill, which was introduced into parliament in February, has won the backing of Morrison, who described the legislation as “terrific” and revealed that he had encouraged her to pursue the issue. Under the legislation, changes would be made to the Sex Discrimination Act to “clarify” that the operation of single-sex sport on the basis of biological sex was not discriminatory. Morrison has continued to back in both Chandler and Deves, rejecting calls for the latter to be disendorsed when nominations to the Australian Electoral Commission close on Tuesday. Despite a backlash among some branch members, Deves has won support from the former MP for the seat, Tony Abbott, and other sitting Liberals. On Monday the conservative assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, described Deves as a “highly credentialed candidate” and any decision to dump her would be up to the NSW division of the party. “I think she’s apologised for things that she now regrets, but her basic position and her basic campaign in standing up for women’s sport I think is a good thing,” Sukkar told the ABC. “I think she is a great candidate.” The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, also said it was a matter for the NSW Liberals to determine but said she did not agree with the remarks made by Deves about trans issues. “I don’t agree with the comments that have been made but it is for for the NSW Liberals to determine,” Andrews told the ABC. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said the debate was “divisive within the community but it’s also divisive within the Liberal party”. “This is just another example of the chaos and division that is there within the Liberal party.”",News/Australia news,Katherine Deves claims key role in controversial bill to ban trans women from women’s sport,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/19/katherine-deves-claims-key-role-in-controversial-bill-to-ban-trans-women-from-womens-sport
4/19/2022,"“Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming.” We’re so consumed by our own achievements that we think of the Book of Jeremiah, from which this quotation is drawn, as ancient and reverent. It dates to about 600BC, but the migrating birds that Jeremiah saw have been making the same journeys out of Africa since the end of the last ice age. The species themselves – storks, kites, eagles, swifts and swallows – and their north-south migratory pattern probably date back millions of years, before there was a hominid species to observe them. They continue now, and Jeremiah at least captures something of the most dramatic bird-migration event in all Eurasia: the channelled flow of avian billions up the Great Rift Valley, all the way from Tanzania to Lebanon. Almost none of these birds will come to the UK (the lesser whitethroat is a remarkable exception), but what the flyway delivers to all parts of Israel, for the duration of the migratory period, is a bird abundance that is sometimes astonishing, occasionally surreal and always beautiful and moving. Moments I recall include the 200 kites and storks soaring on thermals over a motorway garage; the osprey from a bar window as we drank beer; the wryneck in the tiniest park just adjacent to Jerusalem’s Knesset (where they’ve recorded 220 bird species). But most memorable was a flock of 1,000 white pelicans as we drove along the motorway. When I initially spotted it, for a split second I thought it was a mountain village with windows shimmering in late afternoon sunlight. It was actually the sheen from the white flight feathers, and the “windows” turned to blazing white 3.3-metre-long wings as the flock wheeled in a dense, slowly rotating gyre. Most moving was the steady trickle, over two days, of migrant songbirds in their freshest African-forged summer splendour. Beautiful species – ortolan buntings, black-eared and Isabelline wheatears, hoopoes, wrynecks, eastern Orphean warblers, lesser whitethroats, flava wagtails, red-throated pipits – whose colours seemed more vibrant yet fragile as they moved steadily through the most dried-up wadi, in one of the most parched and austere desert panoramas I’ve ever witnessed.

4/19/2022,"A merino sheep named Shrekapo who grew an enormous fleece while evading capture in New Zealand is now 18.6kg lighter after its first shave. The animal was named Shrekapo after the famous sheep Shrek who was found carrying a 27kg fleece after six years on the run in 2004, and after Lake Tekapo, which is near where it was found. Shrekapo was spotted hiding in the rocks last week, and was caught later that day, carrying nearly half its bodyweight in wool. The animal had probably been roaming the hills alone for the past three winters, said Gavin Loxton, owner of Sawdon Station at Lake Tekapo. “He had been spotted up there before by rabbiters and Tahr hunters, and had probably had about three sightings, but any time we had been up there to get him, nobody had been able to find him,” Loxton said. “We had pretty much given up on the whole process, but he’s made it back, so that’s excellent.” The four-year-old is the latest in a series of elusive sheep to have developed overgrown fleeces, entering an unofficial leaderboard of shaggy heavyweight champions across New Zealand and Australia including: Chris, Shrek, Ewenice, Baarack and Shaun the Sheep. Loxton runs 5,000 sheep at his station and said it was unclear how Shrekapo became a hermit sheep. It had had its ear marked and had been tailed, which involves removing the tail to reduce the chance of blowfly strike. “We put the lambs back out after tailing … when we bought them all back in for weaning he must have been left behind up there on his own. “Whether he was snoozing under a bush or something, nobody will ever know.” Shrekapo was blinded by his wool, and as a roughly 40kg sheep, was carrying nearly half his body weight in wool. “And that’s when it’s dry,” Loxton added. Loxton and his crew had some celebratory drinks after finding Shrekapo and “hatched a plan” to shear him at the Easter Monday farmer’s market in Tekapo. Three hundred locals and visitors watched the spectacle, which Loxton said was great for the community after a quiet couple of pandemic years. The 18.6kg fleece would yield about 14kg of clean wool, which would “get you quite a few garments”, Loxton said. After the shave, Shrekapo was a little wobbly adjusting to his new weight, but was now happily “following the sun around like a sun dial”. “It’s a weight off his shoulders.”",News/World news,Sheep shorn of 18kg fleece after three years on the lamb,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/sheep-shorn-of-18kg-fleece-after-three-years-on-the-lamb
