2/15/2022,"Thousands of UK university staff have gone on strike in a new wave of industrial action over pensions, pay and working conditions, claiming they have overwhelming support from students. The University and College Union, which represents university workers, said huge numbers of UCU members had joined picket lines on Monday, where they were supported with musical accompaniment, DIY banners and chants.  By contrast, university employers said there were low levels of industrial action by what it called a minority of UCU members that apparently had little impact on students, in the latest stage of a long-running and increasingly acrimonious dispute. The strike is the first of 10 days of action spread over three weeks. This week it involves 44 universities, including Cambridge, Leeds and Edinburgh, and focuses on pension cuts. Next week strike action will involve 68 universities when 50,000 staff are expected to walk out over pensions, pay and working conditions, affecting about a million students. The UCU general secretary, Jo Grady, who joined the picket line at the University of Strathclyde, said staff were taking action to prevent a 35% cut to their guaranteed retirement income. “The response from students has been overwhelming and I want to thank every single one of them for standing with us,” she said. “These strikes over pension cuts were totally avoidable, but university employers have so far failed to accept compromise proposals put forward by UCU, which would have protected pensions and avoided disruptive industrial action. “Vice-chancellors should not doubt the resolve of our members who are determined to stick this out and win what they deserve.” The pensions dispute is focused on the management and financing of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), the UK’s biggest private pension scheme, which provides pensions to the UK’s older universities as well as for research institutes and academic thinktanks. The two sides are also battling over issues such as the insecure fixed-term contracts used to employ an increasing number of teaching staff. On pay, the union is demanding a £2,500 pay increase for all staff, as well as action to tackle unmanageable workloads and equality pay gaps. There was anger among university staff last week when it emerged that the Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA) recommended that universities should dock 100% of pay for staff who work to rule as part of the forthcoming industrial action. Raj Jethwa, the UCEA chief executive, said: “We are disappointed that UCU is encouraging its members to target students who have endured so many recent disruptions. “While these early reports are of low levels of industrial action and disruption to teaching it does, of course, take time for these large organisations to find out exactly how many scheduled classes have not taken place on a given day.” The strike is the latest in a long-running dispute. In late 2019, UCU staff at 60 universities initially went on strike, which grew to 74 institutions in a second wave of strikes that began in February 2020, when the dispute was overtaken by the Covid-19 outbreak, until it resumed with three days of strikes last December.",News/UK news,Thousands of UK university staff strike over pension cuts,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/14/thousands-of-uk-university-staff-strike-over-pension-cuts
2/15/2022,"I hold no brief for Vladimir Putin, and I am not a member of the Stop the War coalition, but Keir Starmer’s attack on it and his eulogy for Nato is a travesty of history (Under my leadership, Labour’s commitment to Nato is unshakable, 10 February). When the UN was founded in 1945, the imperialist concept of spheres of influence should have become obsolete. But instead of developing common security policies, Nato was established – allegedly – as a defence against a threat from the Soviet Union to attack western Europe. In fact there was, and is, no evidence that there was a plan to overrun the west. When the Soviet Union collapsed and the Warsaw Pact was disbanded, Nato’s alleged raison d’etre disappeared and it too should have been closed down. The standoff with Ukraine must not lead to war. But an arms buildup on both sides makes war more likely. Only discussion and diplomacy can avoid this catastrophe. Constructive dialogue should be brokered by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which operates with a fraction of the budget of Nato, yet gets no publicity for its successes. Increased support for the OSCE would make a much greater contribution to peace in Ukraine and the rest of Europe than flooding the region with more arms.Frank JacksonFormer co-chair, World Disarmament Campaign   As a member of the Labour party and a supporter of Stop the War, I am appalled that Keir Starmer falls back on the old trope about those who oppose war giving succour to our enemies. Does he understand what being opposed to war means? Expressing his faith in the anachronistic Nato militates against the kind of internationalism that is central to the Labour party and socialist philosophy. Starmer is the one giving succour to aggressive militarism. Of course, I am opposed to the kleptocratic regime in Russia and its militarism, but I do not think we should oppose this with a show of military strength from the west.Richard AshwellWolverhampton  Lindsey German’s timely piece encapsulates Keir Starmer’s changed position on Nato (Keir Starmer’s cynical embrace of Nato is a sad sight indeed, 11 February). With the Falklands war, Margaret Thatcher rescued her dire economic policies from likely electoral defeat. Tony Blair survived the calamitous and ongoing war on “weapons of mass destruction” to win another general election. However, David Cameron’s urge to take us back to war in Syria misfired, despite his parliamentary majority. It may be that 12 years of cuts to essential services and the weariness of an ongoing pandemic will not make war an inevitable vote winner.Dr Alan LaffertyLondon  Lindsey German emphasises Nato’s real recent misdeeds, but doesn’t consider the present context and situation. There is no mention of Russia’s seizures of Georgian and Ukrainian territories, nor its support for the armed conflict in the Donbas region and the shooting down of a civil airliner. If there is a “march towards war over Ukraine”, it’s been provoked by the massing of Russian forces on Ukraine’s borders, a real encircling of a sovereign nation, not the encircling of Russia claimed by geographically challenged opponents of Nato. German’s reference to Nato as “expansionist” is similarly partial. The nations that joined Nato in the past 20 years had direct experience of Russian rule and subjugation, which they do not want to see repeated.

A common theme in disabled people’s experiences of the pandemic has been a sense of profound inequality. Disabled people have faced a higher clinical risk, bigger threats to job security and more barriers to living well from Covid-19. And the feeling among many disabled people that their needs are being ignored has only been accentuated by a perceived desire by the government to return to the “old normal” while the virus still poses a serious threat to lives and livelihoods.  We all want to put the pandemic behind us, but the fact remains that social distancing measures are being scrapped while rates are high and policymakers are shying away from making decisions on mandatory vaccinations.

As a result, the ebook library, which we set up rapidly after lockdown, proved less popular than we had expected, though other digital services we provided were much appreciated.

2/15/2022,"If our school days are the happiest of our lives, I’m worried for the Euphoria teens. In the season two opener, the kids of East Highland saw a drug dealer being murdered with a hammer by another drug dealer named “Ashtray” (because he ate discarded cigarettes as a child). One girl celebrates New Year’s Eve by hiding under a urine-soaked towel in a bath, and the school’s toxic jock is beaten up so brutally his face has to be stitched back together. As Rue – Euphoria’s enigmatic lynchpin played by Emmy-winner Zendaya – says in the closing seconds: “Damn.” We had been warned. Before this adolescent journey through drugs, sex and social media resumed, Zendaya told her followers on social media that the second season may be even more “triggering and difficult to watch” than the first. She wasn’t wrong. There’s a torturous drug relapse that ends in a bathtime morphine session, a manipulative love triangle and a battle for an underage sex tape that leads to a game of Russian roulette. Euphoria often feels less high school, more horror film.  That teenage life can be hell is not new territory for television. Skins, the Bristol-set series that recently turned 15, was partial to killing off its characters. Buffy was slaying vampires with stakes while attending class in the late 90s. In recent years, though, teen drama has darkened. Riverdale – based on a comic book series about the happy lives of suburban teenagers – revolves around serial killers and drug rings. In 13 Reasons Why, a teenage girl listed all the reasons why she killed herself. Perhaps the best example of how times have changed for on-screen teens is last year’s reboot of the soapy noughties classic Gossip Girl. When the super-rich kids of Constance Billard resumed class, there was a new accessory among the Balenciaga trainers and Jacquemus handbags: abject misery. Out was unthinking privilege, in was self-seriousness. The new queen bee Julien is a tortured influencer. Max Wolfe, the reboot’s answer to the original’s antihero Chuck Bass, is stuck in a bleak three-way relationship with two best friends who care more about their sex lives than Max’s actual feelings. They discussed the ethics of property development, brand endorsements and Broadway plays. They did not have fun. It’s not hard to see why these shows have become so serious. When Gossip Girl first hit our screens in 2007, it was glitzy fluff. Fifteen years later, times are darker to the extent that it would be almost impossible not to engage with more serious issues. Especially as, in the intervening years, the technology that made the original concept so fun – an all-knowing, gossip-starved blogger! – has become something uglier. The teens are snapped in real time cheating on each other; they’re constantly worrying about how they are perceived online. The Gossip Girl reboot isn’t always an elegant reflection of modern teen anxieties, but it is a symptom of them. It’s also worth remembering that, extreme as the plotlines of shows like Euphoria may be at times, reality underlies them. In the US, the opioid crisis was declared a public health emergency in 2017. Showrunner Sam Levinson struggled with drug addiction as a teenager, eventually checking himself into rehab at 19. Though Rue’s addiction is increasingly difficult to watch, it is addressed with patience, rather than solved neatly by a season finale. Plotlines based around social media-induced anxiety are also simply depicting the reality of life for many teens. One of the best scenes in Euphoria’s second season is when body-conscious teen Kat, who had apparently overcome her self-confidence issues last season, breaks down again. In her messy bedroom, she is assaulted by imaginary body positivity influencers. “Kat, you’re one of the bravest, most beautiful human beings I’ve ever seen,” a perfectly preened, bikini-clad blonde tells her. Another screams at her to embrace her “inner fucking warrior”. It is a delicious take-down of anodyne influencer culture: the notion that people will simply feel beautiful by being told they are beautiful by beautiful people. When one model assures her that she has mental issues too, Kat laughs in her face: “I wish my mental problems made me look like you.” Teen dramas have always thrived on controversy. The original Gossip Girl ran an ad campaign proclaiming the show “every parent’s nightmare”. This season, Euphoria has doubled its viewing figures and secured a third run, no doubt aided by the trending topics and memes it inspires with every shocking turn. Every generation, it seems, likes to think of itself as the most scandalous. But in the current landscape of regularly scheduled anxiety and overdoses, it’s hard to imagine just how much bleaker these shows can get. While there will always be fresh miseries at hand – a pandemic is right there for the taking – it might benefit some of them to take a lighter approach. Being a teenager can be a world-consuming cycle of hell but, with a little perspective, it can also be pretty funny.",Arts/Television & radio,"‘Less high school, more horror film’: why is teen drama so miserable now?",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/14/euphoria-gossip-girl-less-high-school-more-horror-film-why-is-teen-drama-so-miserable-now
2/15/2022,"Pep Guardiola says harmony at Manchester City’s is exceptional but insisted he will not be the manager for as long as Sir Alex Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United. Guardiola is in his sixth yearat City, a tenure that has so far been supremely successful. While his opening season was trophyless, the 50-year-old has since led City to three Premier League titles, the FA Cup, four successive League Cups, and last term’s Champions League final. City’s first domestic crown was claimed with a record 100 points, and if Guardiola’s side defend the title this year – they lead Liverpool, who have played a game less, by nine points – he will join Ferguson as the only manager in the Premier League era to do so twice.  Yet Guardiola is clear he will not emulate the Scot, who led United for 26 and a half years. “I’m not going to be Sir Alex Ferguson, don’t worry,” he said. “The harmony [though] in this team right now is exceptional, thanks to the captains – it’s exceptional because of them.” While Fernandinho is the official captain, Rúben Dias and Kevin De Bruyne are also part of a strong leadership group. Guardiola believes the team spirit is the strongest since he took over in summer 2016. “We know each other well [now],” he said. “My harmony with, and respect for, them is much better, after six seasons. We know each other perfectly and we accept the good things and the bad things. And we want to fight and be part of it [the team]. “The harmony is important because in our last 20 games, we have won 18, drawn one and lost one to Leipzig when we didn’t play for anything. I know all the guys [players], and sometimes they are disappointed when they don’t play. But our harmony comes because at this club, the players know the physios, the sports scientists, everyone is just there to help them, so they cannot complain.” City will be without Jack Grealish, Cole Palmer and Gabriel Jesus for the Champions League last-16 first leg at Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday because of injury but remains in a confident mood after an unbeaten run that dates back to the game against Leipzig on 7th December in a dead rubber. “That is the most important thing,” Guardiola said. “To win or lose is random, you never know what will happen in the future. But the period we are together we try to beat our opponents with big smiles and good moods because when you have bad faces it’s impossible. When that happens, the rest is not important – we can’t control the results.

2/15/2022,"The FIA has chosen not to disclose the findings of its inquiry into the controversial ending of the Formula One world championship-deciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix last season. The sport’s governing body presented its report to the teams on Monday but has stated after discussions at the F1 commission that it will only reveal plans of proposed changes in the forthcoming days. There is no indication, however, that the FIA will make the findings of its investigation public, which will not be welcomed by many who felt the sport’s very integrity was put at risk by events at the 2021 season finale. The FIA, for which this is a real test of governance and for the leadership of the newly appointed president Mohammed ben Sulayem, had been expected to share the findings of its investigation publicly but instead issued a short statement.  “The FIA president led detailed discussions of the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix,” it read. “Feedback from the commission on matters raised will be incorporated into the president’s analysis and he will publicly present news of structural changes and action plan in the coming days.” After protests from Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes team in Abu Dhabi were dismissed by the FIA stewards, the organisation came under fire for “marking its own homework”. Similar accusations are likely to be raised if only proposed changes are announced and details of the findings of its investigation are not presented. Max Verstappen won in Abu Dhabi after the race director Michael Masi improvised around the rules in order to try to ensure the race did not finish behind a safety car, specifically in the way backmarkers could unlap themselves and in how long the safety car had to remain on track after they had begun to do so. Masi’s actions faced even greater scrutiny after he appeared to be reacting to pressure from radio communications with Verstappen’s Red Bull team. It allowed Verstappen on new tyres to attack and pass Lewis Hamilton on the final lap to secure his first title. Masi’s future remains in doubt and F1 under scrutiny as it attempts to draw a line under the controversial close to the 2021 season. After the equally controversial decision to count two laps behind the safety car at last year’s washed out Belgian Grand Prix as a race and award half points, the FIA has proposed rule changes on races shortened because of bad weather. Two laps without the safety car or virtual safety car will be required in future to count as a race and a percentage scale applied for points according to how much of the race has been completed.

2/15/2022,"Almost one year ago, Russia began moving forces from Siberia and other regions to the border with Ukraine. With more than half of its land forces now poised for an attack, whether or not there will be a war with Ukraine hinges on the decision of Vladimir Putin, whose options range from a large-scale assault to a decision to hold his troops back or ultimately send them home. At stake is a potentially devastating conflict, sanctions and economic hardship, and a verdict on the legacy of Putin, who has broadcast his decision to engage in brinksmanship with the west, saying that the tensions have a “definite effect” and should be maintained “as long as possible”.  Putin has been clear about what he wants: to reverse Nato expansion in Europe and a pledge that Ukraine will never join the alliance, but the main question remains how far he is willing to go to achieve that goal. And if he does de-escalate, then does he have anything concrete to show for the last year? In an unusual bit of play-acting on Monday, Putin invited his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, to the Kremlin for carefully scripted discussions on how it was all going. “Sergei Viktorovich, what do you think, in your opinion is there a chance to reach an agreement with our partners on the key questions causing our concerns?” Putin asked in a televised discussion that set the stage for the Kremlin’s next steps. “We have said more than once that we warn against endless conversations on issues that need to be resolved today,” said Lavrov, repeating a warning that Russia would not be filibustered. “But still, probably as the foreign minister, I should say that there is always a chance.” He told Putin to continue holding talks with the west. Shoigu, likewise, told Putin that a number of military drills were “ending”, signalling that Russia could pull back some of its heavy weaponry soon. “Summary of Putin’s meeting with Shoigu: exercises are ending, everyone is going home, Russia will not have a new war with Ukraine,” one Kremlin pool reporter wrote after the meeting. The reality on the ground is not so encouraging. Open source data has continued to show aircraft and helicopters deploying near the border and tanks and artillery leaving staging areas for positions where they would be poised for an attack. And much of the weaponry that the Kremlin has put at Ukraine’s borders is not officially involved in any exercises. Still, the televised meetings with his top officials were a rare nod towards de-escalation for Putin, who has explained little to the public about this crisis and appears to be isolated even from his own ministers in his decision-making. At the Kremlin, Lavrov and Shoigu were both forced to sit at the end of a long conference table, part of the draconian anti-Covid measures that the Kremlin has employed in recent months (including when Emmanuel Macron visited for talks last week). The indication was that these were formal meetings with Lavrov and Shoigu meant for television cameras rather than real consultations. The timing coincides with what western officials have warned is a crucial week on the Ukrainian border with Russia ready to begin offensive operations “at any time”. US media have reported that Joe Biden told Nato allies that Russia could launch an attack beginning on Wednesday, although he claimed that Putin had not given the order yet. (Russian media have ridiculed those claims, as well as US allegations that the Kremlin had plans to install an occupation government and film a propaganda video of a “false-flag” attack as a casus belli.) If Russia is preparing for a large war, it does not appear to have prepared its own public for it either. Updates on Ukraine often run in the middle of news broadcasts and most media have not run the kind of hysterical, jingoistic programming that dominated the airwaves in 2014. There are some exceptions. Margarita Simonyan, the hawkish head of RT, has regularly advocated for intervention and incorporation of the Russian-controlled separatist areas. “Russia cannot not stop this war,” she said during a nationally broadcast television programme. “What are we waiting for? When there are concentration camps? When they start gassing their own population?” The mood in Kyiv has also shown calm and a lack of panic. But western allies led by the United States have withdrawn their diplomatic staff, urged their citizens to leave, and some airlines have said they would stop flying over the country because of potential dangers involved. Kyiv has been forced to launch a $600m (£444m) insurance fund to ensure that air travel to the country continues. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and other Ukrainian officials have warned that it is a key goal of the Russian buildupto foment internal tensions, put pressure on the economy, and convince Ukraine of its precarious situation as Moscow seeks to reverse its drift to the west. The Russian business daily Kommersant said on Monday that the last three months of “diplomatic and security pressure” had brought some rewards: increased pressure on Ukraine from the west over the Minsk accords, a recognition of Russia’s willingness to fight any future Nato expansion and a queue of top western politicians to meet and speak with Putin. But the pressure “has had a multitude of negative effects”, the newspaper added, noting that while the plusses exist “only on paper”, the negative effects have already become a reality. Those have included a revitalisation of Nato, with deployments of US and other troops to eastern Europe, as well as direct deliveries of lethal arms to Ukraine, such as the thousands of anti-tank missiles delivered by the UK. Responding to a question from the Guardian, the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said that Shoigu had complained specifically about those deliveries last week when the pair met. “No matter how many weapons we have delivered, they are dwarfed by the scale of the forces on the other side of the border,” Wallace said he replied. They would only play a role, he added, “if you were defending yourself from an invasion”.",News/World news,Putin continues to rattle sabre but with rare nod towards de-escalation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/russia-ukraine-putin-continues-to-rattle-sabre-but-with-rare-nod-towards-de-escalation
2/15/2022,"The decision to allow the Russian prodigy Kamila Valieva to take part in the women’s figure skating competition less than two months after testing positive for a banned heart medication has cast a shadow over the glamour event of the Winter Olympics that will persist for years to come, further tainting the reputation of a Beijing Games already beset by controversy. Armed with a quiver of point-gobbling quadruple jumps, the 15-year-old Valieva set the world record for combined total score in her first outing as a senior in October and has only improved from there, skating with a deeper maturity and sophistication in each competition through to the team event last week in Beijing, where she became the first woman to land a four-revolution jump on Olympic ice. But the entirety of her sensational debut campaign was thrown into question on Friday after it was revealed she tested positive for a prohibited substance known to increase endurance and stamina.  The ruling handed down on Monday by the court of arbitration for sport, allowing Valieva to compete while appealing against the positive result, represents a mockery of the Olympic movement. The likelihood that Valieva will fly home with not one but two gold medals despite testing positive for an illegal substance is a devastating optical blow for a sport that, practically, has only just emerged from the judging scandal at the 2002 Olympics that left its integrity in tatters. At times such as these – and Monday will surely go down as one of figure skating’s darkest days – the instinct to assign blame kicks in. But the widespread anger toward the Cas decision is misguided. The panel of three judges were not charged with examining whether or not Valieva doped, rather the procedural matter of whether the Russian teenager should be suspended until it is determined whether she did. The search for culpability that follows in the coming months along with the investigation into the merits of the case – one that could still end with Valieva stripped of her medals – will extend to the skater’s entourage and whether anyone in it encouraged the use of a banned substance. Top of that list is Eteri Tutberidze, the enigmatic, polarising coach whose methods have forged skaters that have dominated the international scene for eight years while drawing criticism for their short, injury-prone careers. On Saturday she admitted the situation was “very controversial and difficult” but added: “I want to say that I am absolutely sure that Kamila is innocent and clean.” Another is Filipp Shvetsky, the doctor at rinkside for Valieva’s senior international debut in October who was reportedly banned from working with Russia’s rowing team following a 2007 doping inquest. Shvetsky claims he was made a scapegoat. Other members of her coaching team on the ground in Beijing are Sergei Dudakov and Daniil Gleikhengauz, both of whom hail from the Sambo-70 club in Moscow where Tutberidze is head coach. None of Valieva’s support personnel have been formally accused of any wrongdoing. The maelstrom has already generated backlash in Russia, where the hashtag #позорТутберидзе, or #shameonTutberidze was trending on Twitter as news of Valieva’s positive drug test spread on Friday. Since then Valieva, who has appeared distraught in training sessions in the days since the news broke, has been seized on as a reminder of how vulnerable young athletes remain. Adam Rippon – the 2018 Olympic bronze medallist and coach of the American skater Mariah Bell – who will compete against Valieva this week – said: “The adults around her have completely failed her. They’ve put her in this awful situation and should be punished.” As far as the stain on the women’s competition, which begins on Tuesday with the short programme and concludes with Thursday’s free skate, the blame falls on the collective failure of the alphabet soup of organisations in the Olympic orbit – none more than the International Olympic Committee – to hold the line on Russia’s serial malfeasance over the years. What has passed for discipline has plainly failed to create an adequate deterrent for the glory of gold over the welfare of athletes. When a judging scandal rocked the pairs figure skating competition at the 2002 Olympics, ultimately leading to a complete overhaul of the scoring system, the Russian team who benefitted were awarded duplicate golds rather than downgraded to silver and no extensive investigation was ever conducted. The years-long doping program that included the sabotaging of drug tests during the 2014 Sochi Olympics was answered with a banning of the Russian flag rather than the state behind it, with more than 300 athletes from Russia invited to compete at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games under the Russian Olympic Committee designation. Now a young athlete is cleared to compete after testing positive for a banned substance, handing another victory to Russia’s state-sponsored doping system if Valieva’s positive test is confirmed. The obvious way forward is to raise the age minimum, which feels like a foregone conclusion if it is found that bad actors were able to exploit the idea of a “protected person” as a loophole to circumvent the rules. But that won’t save this year’s competition, the one time every four years when the general public leans forward and pays attention. The IOC responded with surprising force on Monday evening, saying there would be no medal ceremony for last week’s team competition and no medal ceremony for the women’s event this week if Valieva finishes on the podium, stating it would not be appropriate to include an athlete with a positive A-sample but whose violation of anti-doping rules has not been established.

2/15/2022,"Police in Kentucky were seeking an “active shooter” on Monday in what local officials say was an assassination attempt on a Democratic party candidate for Louisville city mayor. Craig Greenberg tweeted that he and his staff were safe and uninjured after an unidentified gunman entered his fourth-floor office in a downtown office building at around 10am and fired multiple shots.  The Louisville Metro police department said it was “working a situation” at a downtown location, but was unable to confirm if a suspect was in custody. Reporters at the scene said multiple police units responded to the incident, and that Greenberg and his campaign staff were led to safety by a Swat team, apparently unharmed. According to Louisville council member David James, speaking to WDRB News, it remained an “active shooter” situation at Monday lunchtime. James later told WLKY News that he believed it was “an assassination attempt on Greenberg and his staff”. Greenberg is among the frontrunners in the upcoming Democratic primary for city mayor, according to HuffPost, and would be “an overwhelming favorite” if he won the nomination. Several Louisville council members are supporting his candidacy, while others have refused to endorse him.",News/US news,Kentucky police seek shooter after ‘assassination attempt’ of candidate ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/14/louisville-assassination-attempt-craig-greenbergd-democrat
2/15/2022,"There may still somehow be more than three months to go until the end of the Premier League season, but this felt like a big weekend for the relegation battle (or lack thereof). Frank Lampard got one over on old adversaries Leeds with his new club, Frank Lampard’s Everton, while the scrappy, last-on-Match-of-the-Day stalemate between Brentford and Crystal Palace allowed pundits to quickly mutter that both sides will be fine before Gary Lineker wrapped up.  For the current bottom three, results were not so encouraging. Norwich started well enough before their game with Manchester City turned into a long, gruelling chapter of Raheem Sterling’s Soccer Skills. Despite 82 years of management experience between them, neither Roy Hodgson nor Claudio Ranieri can get Watford to defend properly. Burnley, with one win in 21, still have those games in hand. Above them, in 17th place and rising, are Newcastle United. After one league victory all season, Eddie Howe’s team have now won three in a row, restoring a feelgood factor not seen at St James’ Park since about 2005. Newcastle made four January signings, but it is the first recruit that has stood out the most – far from simply whipping the ball in the direction of Chris Wood, Kieran Trippier has brought necessary set-piece skills and helped tighten the defence. The only player to score against Newcastle in those three wins was Jamaal Lascelles, replaced by Dan Burn against Aston Villa, with Trippier taking the captain’s armband as the Saudi-backed revolution began in earnest. This being Newcastle, however, no sooner had Trippier’s deflected free-kick winner moved them four points clear of the drop zone than their new leader was limping off the field. The club confirmed on Monday that K-Trips has broken a bone in his foot, and faces several weeks out. Given his immediate impact on Tyneside, this could become the most closely-monitored metatarsal since David Beckham. Oh, Newcastle! Just when they thought they were out, and all that. On the other hand, an upcoming fixture list of West Ham (A), Brentford (A), Brighton (H), Chelsea (A) and Palace (H) offers chances for hard-earned points (the best of all points). Howe has also had the common sense to improve the players he already had, adding purpose to Alain Saint-Maximin’s freestyle shapes and even retrieving Jonjo Shelvey from his cryogenic chamber. We can’t believe we’re saying this, but maybe Newcastle ... will be fine? It’s been a while since I wrote a rhyme,I’m not sure this one will stand the test of time.But there are certain words, which I’d like to say,About the love of my life, around me every day.You’re always there in my time of need,Since the first day, when you planted the seed.That smile said it all, that’s why you’re my girl,The look with those eyes sent my head in a whirl.I love you more than ever, that’s for sure,We’re a perfect match; I know there’s no cure.I’m so in love with you, at times I could cry,I find myself looking at you, and boy, do I sigh.You’re so lucky today if you find the right wife,We’re a match made in heaven, it’s lasting for life.Two wonderful children: our Amy and Will,[If] my father could see them, he’d [be called] Grandpa Bill.I know he’d be proud of what we’ve been through,Almost joined at the hip since, stuck with glue.I never want you to be bored when I say: ‘I love you’The simple fact is, I just do!

2/15/2022,"The father of a Parkland shooting victim was taken into custody after scaling a construction crane near the White House on Monday as part of a protest against gun violence and in honor of the fourth anniversary of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school shooting in Florida that killed 17 people and wounded 17 more. Manuel Oliver, whose 17-year old son Joaquin “Guac” Oliver was one of the 17 victims in the country’s deadliest high school shooting, said he climbed the 150ft crane “so the whole world will listen to Joaquin today”.  Atop the crane, Oliver unfurled a banner that displayed a picture of his son and a message to Joe Biden that said: “45K people died from gun violence on your watch.” Police surrounded the crane below and shut down the 600 block of 15th Street Northwest. “I was in DC [in] December asking to meet @POTUS. Today GUAC is with me making [his] own statement! So the whole nation can judge our reality. 150 feet high in front of the [White House]. Peaceful action. Police is on the ground!” Oliver tweeted this morning. Pictures soon emerged on social media of Oliver being arrested by police. His non-profit advocacy group Change the Ref confirmed with the Guardian that he has been taken into custody. In December, Oliver said he flew to the capital with no invite to try to speak to the president about gun violence and tightening gun control legislation. “There is no time for a formal invitation, and I’m here,” Oliver told WUSA9 in December. “We don’t need to waste more time. I’m going to do something that I haven’t done yet. I’m going back to a person I already met while he was campaigning for president and I’m planning to have him receive me and I want some answers.” He went on to add: “Everything that we talked about, what’s the agenda, what’s the plan? Since Joaquin was murdered, more than 150,000 people have lost their lives because of gun violence.” Since his son’s death, Oliver has been no stranger to gun control activism. In 2018, Oliver performed a one-man play titled Guac: My Son, My Hero in honor of his son and other victims and families of gun violence. He and his wife, Patricia, have also painted murals for Change the Ref, which they launched after the Parkland shooting. The mission of the group is to “raise awareness about mass shooting through strategic interventions that will reduce the influence of the NRA [National Rifle Association] on the federal level”, its website said. David Hogg, a gun-control campaigner and survivor of the shooting, spoke in support of Oliver below the crane, saying: “Manuel Oliver is an advocate for gun violence prevention and he is up there today demanding change from the Biden administration for them to do everything they possibly can to address gun violence and stop the next Parkland from happening before it does.” Hogg then directed viewers to visit Shock Market, a social media campaign that tracks gun violence losses under the Biden administration. Shock Market, which Hogg chose to launch on the fourth anniversary of the shooting, includes breakdowns of gun violence including deaths, injuries, mass shootings, minors killed and injured and unintentional shootings, among other categories. Since Biden’s inauguration, 47,611 people have died due to gun violence, according to the campaign. Last October, the Parkland school shooter, Nikolas Cruz, pleaded guilty to 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder in the first degree. The guilty pleas will set the stage for a penalty trial in which 12 jurors will determine whether Cruz should be sentenced to death or life in prison without parole.",News/US news,Parkland victim’s father in custody after scaling crane by White House in protest,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/14/parkland-victim-father-crane-protest-manuel-oliver
2/15/2022,"A retired Florida police captain went on trial for murder on Monday, eight years after he shot dead a moviegoer who threw a bag of popcorn at him in a dispute over text messages. Curtis Reeves, now 79, killed Chad Oulson, 43, at a movie theater in the Tampa suburb of Wesley Chapel shortly after the confrontation over the younger man’s use of his cellphone while previews were playing.  Reeves initially attempted to use Florida’s controversial stand-your-ground law to insist he acted in self-defense, but a judge ruled in 2017 that the doctrine did not apply. Subsequent legal arguments and the Covid-19 pandemic further delayed the case. “The eight-year delay is, in my opinion, embarrassing and only benefited Curtis Reeves as it allowed him to contribute to be at home with his loved ones and spend time with his family,” TJ Grimaldi, attorney for Oulson’s wife, Nicole, said in a statement. “All [this] while Ms Oulson was stuck waiting for delay after delay to be resolved.” Opening statements in the second-degree murder trial were presented on Monday morning before a jury of six. Prosecutors are attempting to paint Reeves as an overzealous character who had prior disagreements with other patrons over their cellphone use in the auditorium. Lawyers for Reeves, meanwhile, will argue that their client felt threatened by Oulson, who they say was angry and obstructive, and threw what Reeves believed was a cellphone at his head. Witnesses have previously said that the pair argued over the texting, and Reeves attempted to find a manager. “He came back very irritated. Somebody throws popcorn, I don’t know who threw the popcorn. And then bang, he was shot,” Charles Cummings, an eyewitness, said at the time. Oulson was taken to hospital in Tampa, where he was pronounced dead. His wife, who was wounded in the hand by the shot that killed her husband, was released after treatment. In an appearance on ABC’s Good Morning America in 2014, shortly after the shooting, Nicole Oulson said her husband was checking for messages from their babysitter before the movie started, and planned to put the phone away when Reeves confronted them. “It was a couple of words. No threats. No harm. No nothing,” she said. Grimaldi told CNN on Monday that Nicole Oulson would tell her story to the jury. “While going through a trial forces her to relive this situation, that she would rather forget, she can’t wait for the day that justice is served – Curtis Reeves is found guilty and spends the rest of his natural life in prison paying for his crimes,” he said. During jury selection last week, Reeves entered the courtroom walking slowly with a cane. In opening arguments on Monday, according to reporters at the Pasco county courthouse, prosecutor Scott Rosenwasser asked the jury to compare the defendant’s insistence that he suffered from arthritis in his back to witness statements and videos from the auditorium that show him moving freely, and lunging at Oulson with his gun. Attorneys for Reeves, a former captain with the Tampa police department, described by neighbors as “a good guy”, failed to persuade Judge Susan Barthle five years ago to dismiss the charge. The circumstances of the case, she said, were not “those envisioned by the legislature when the stand-your-ground law was enacted”. George Zimmerman, a white neighborhood watchman who was acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin in 2012 in another Florida case with many similarities, did not rely on the stand-your-ground law, but successfully argued he was forced to fire the fatal shot in self-defense.",News/US news,Murder trial begins of former Florida police captain who shot dead moviegoer,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/14/florida-murder-trial-curtis-reeves-movie-text-messages
2/15/2022,"She’s Lady Macbeth, scheming, manipulative, a forward planner; but she’s also feckless, work-shy, addicted to holidays, with a brain that can’t plot the optics from one Instagram post to another. Thus is Carrie Johnson characterised in the new biography from Michael Ashcroft, the Tory peer who makes these unflattering, scattershot pen portraits his contribution to the literary canon. His biographies rarely make a huge addition to the public understanding of a person; the modus operandi appears to be to find anyone, genuinely anyone, right down to someone who met them once at university and doesn’t remember them (so the reader can infer, Ashcroft will typically suggest, that they weren’t very memorable), prepared to make a bitchy remark, and then note it down. Inevitably, the character that then emerges is a little contradictory. To this, the author brings his own baggage: that title of the biography in full – First Lady: Intrigue at the Court of Carrie and Boris Johnson. What’s he trying to say? Is she Eleanor Roosevelt (ultimate first lady, never knowingly thwarted?), or Cherie Blair (often accused of trying out the role, assailed by pratfalls as she learned the hard way what the British political scene expects of a spouse?). Is she Anne Boleyn (controlling the court with vixen spite and the king with unexpected sexual manoeuvres she learned in France?), or Kate Middleton (bland on the surface, but underneath … well, she’s female, right? So probably underneath is something worse). In this medley of puppeteer-wife stereotypes, you can’t really pick out a tune. That’s medleys for you: they were designed for people who prefer not to follow things through.  But the endless stories in the book: Carrie, who allegedly demanded an iPad from work even though it was incompatible with the system; who never turned up; whose friendships ran hot but didn’t last; whose ex-boyfriends can recall seemingly word for word the times she lashed out unreasonably … Even if the evidence isn’t all consistent, it nevertheless builds a picture of a wrong ’un, and upon this hangs the faith of the few remaining defenders of Boris Johnson. He wasn’t destined to become this kind of prime minister. He’s just a fool for love. On this, it’s maybe safer to remain agnostic. We could run counterfactuals for ever and we’d still be in the same situation; maybe if you were trying to write a period drama, it would help to know which character flaws were hitched to which relationship. If you’re wishing for a more effective government, it really doesn’t matter who is worse between Boris and Carrie Johnson, nor which of them wears the trousers. However, there are those who would defend not Boris Johnson but his party and their project, and they’re going for the classic left-right switcheroo, a cheap three-cups magic trick in which the people who thought they were on the side of the angels find themselves suddenly – who could possibly have foreseen? – the true villains. First, they find a diversity angle: in Carrie’s case, that she is female. Nobody would be saying these things about her if she wasn’t. Ergo, the substance and tone of the attack are misogynistic. Anyone who denies that is failing to take misogyny seriously (and now, of all times, ladies and gentlemen! Just when worldwide misogyny has never been more serious!). Anyone who continues to attack her is, themselves, a hater of women. The aim is to discombobulate feminists so much that we don’t know which way is up – if we can’t decide whether Carrie is good or bad, if we’re in thrall to sexist narratives that belong in a different century, then how can we possibly say what we think of her husband, what we think of the entire predicament? And there’s more: we disagree with Priti Patel because we’re racist, we fault Cressida Dick because we’re sexist and homophobic, the only person we’re allowed to criticise on this ship of fools is Michael Fabricant, and even then it is illiberal to mention his hair. The truly irking thing is that nobody, literally nobody, buys any of this: the people crying sexism don’t really believe it’s that, and wouldn’t care if it was. The people who abhor sexism know it isn’t that. It’s not even a discursive manoeuvre, it’s more like throwing a tarantula into a Scrabble bag, so that no one wants to put their hand in, and the game simply dissolves, its players move on.
