It emerged Thursday that Musk has offered to buy Twitter outright in a $43 billion deal. Sweeney reacted to the news by tweeting: ""Oh no."" A teenager who made an enemy of Elon Musk by creating a Twitter account to track his private jet hasn't reacted well to the billionaire's offer to buy the social-media platform outright. ""Oh no,"" Jack Sweeney, 19, tweeted Thursday, adding: ""Probably good for Twitter but probably not me lol."" Sweeney entered the spotlight at the start of 2021 when it emerged that Musk offered him $5,000 to take down the jet-tracking Twitter account. Musk told him it was a ""security risk"" and he didn't want to be ""shot by a nutcase,"" according to Protocol, which first reported the story. Sweeney later told Insider he thought the amount of money Musk offered was too low for the satisfaction he got from running the account. The account, ""Elon Musk's Jet,"" has 402,000 followers. Sweeney said he started the account in June 2020 and uses bots to scrape publicly-available air-traffic data, thereby alerting the account's followers to the movements of Musk's private jet. Musk said in a tweet in January that social-media accounts discussing his whereabouts were ""becoming a security issue."" Musk disclosed in early April that he'd taken a 9.2% stake in Twitter.

It appears the women became pregnant from ""consensual sexual relationships with another incarcerated person,"" Dan Sperrazza, the Department of Corrections’s external affairs executive director, told NJ.com. The prisoners are held at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility in Clinton, which has faced a long string of sex assault scandals. Gov. Phil Murphy announced plans last year to shutter the facility, which is New Jersey’s only women’s prison. NEW JERSEY RELEASES HUNDREDS OF INMATES UNDER COVID LAW The prison houses more than 800 inmates, and began housing transgender women last year following a lawsuit brought forth by a trans inmate who lived in men’s prisons for 18 months and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. There are 27 inmates who identify as transgender currently housed at the facility, according to NJ.com. New Jersey's policy does not require trans women inmates to undergo gender-reassignment surgery to be held in the facility. ""While DOC cannot comment on any specific disciplinary or housing decisions that may be considered in light of these events, the Department always reserves all options to ensure the health and safety of the individuals in its custody,"" Sperrazza told the Daily Mail. Two Edna Mahan prisoners filed a lawsuit last year seeking to end New Jersey’s gender identity policy for prisons, claiming they were harassed by trans inmates and that transgender inmates were having sex with female prisoners. ACLU legal director Jeanne LoCicero defended the policy of allowing transgender inmates in a women’s prison as one that protects the rights of transgender women. ""[It's] in line with New Jersey's strong anti-discrimination laws that prevent discrimination and harassment on the basis of gender identity,"" she told NJ.com. The union representing correctional officers at the prison has meanwhile slammed the policy. ""We opposed this policy change believing it would be detrimental to the general population of female inmates being housed at Edna Mahan and also bring added stress to our correctional police officers assigned to this institution,"" the union's president told NJ.com.

4/15/2022,"Men should pay on first dates to check if their date is ""entitled,"" divorce lawyer Justin Lee said. It's the ""best litmus test"" for a partner, the Toronto-based family lawyer said on TikTok. The video sparked debate on dating etiquette and who should pay for dates. Men should always pay on first dates — but not for the reasons you might think. At least that's according to one Toronto-based divorce lawyer who think paying for dates is the perfect litmus test. ""The issue isn't tied to the number of dollars that we're spending at the end of the date,"" divorce lawyer Justin Lee said in a TikTok video that has more than 342,000 views. ""The issue is when we end up paying for someone who has this real sense of entitlement, like this expectation that we will pay. That's precisely why we need to always pay."" It's the ""best litmus test,"" he described in the caption. ""Your date, whoever that is, may very well be the person you end up marrying. And trust me when I say, as a divorce lawyer, who you end up marrying is so, so important,"" he continued in the video. ""Let's say, at the end of the date, you pull out your wallet and you offer to pay. And your date just sits there, expecting you to pay, as if that is the obvious course of action,"" he said. ""You just learned that the person in front of you is entitled, and frankly, has the audacity to expect a near stranger to pay for them. Just imagine how someone like that would treat their significant other."" He added: ""For a low, low price of $20, $30, $40, you learned that the person in front of you does not have the basic courtesy to pretend to offer to pay. And therefore you should never go on another date with them."" Lee, who has 175,800 followers on TikTok, is a family law attorney working at McCarthy Hansen & Company in Toronto, Canada. He did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. The video sparked discussions on dating etiquette, with some users saying that the person who asks for the date should be expected to pay. ""Counterpoint — for a first date, usually the woman has invested far more money (and time) into clothes, hair, makeup, etc — everything a man expects,"" a user wrote in a comment that got more than 1,600 likes. In the comments, Lee stressed that men will ""gladly pay"" because ""the payment isn't the issue."" ""The issue is when women perceive the payment as an obligation as opposed to a kind gesture.

4/15/2022,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Hundreds of small earthquakes have been reported near a volcano in southeast Alaska believed to have been dormant for at least 800 years. The cause of the quakes under Mount Edgecumbe, a volcano near Sitka that resembles Mount Fuji in Japan, are not known. However, they may not be an indication of volcanic activity, said Dave Schneider, a research geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the Alaska Volcano Observatory in Anchorage. Mount Edgecumbe is a 3,200-foot (976-meter) stratovolcano located on Kruzof Island, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Sitka. The volcano is part of a larger underwater volcanic field of lava domes and craters. The quakes are somewhat unusual since temblors in the area are usually tectonic, not volcanic, he said. “These aren’t necessarily related to volcanic activity, they could be a tectonic in nature or a combination of tectonics and the volcano,” he said. “We really can’t tell the difference at this point.” Right now, there is no need for a huge amount of concern, Schneider said. “Volcanoes do have swarms of earthquakes that do not lead to eruption,” he said. The earthquakes, most of which were too small to be observed on multiple seismic stations, continued Wednesday although the frequency has declined. “I don’t think anybody was even aware that those happened,” said Zach Mayville who answered the phone at House of Liquor in Sitka. He said there’s been no damage from the quakes. “We didn’t feel anything,” Mayville said. “We’ve heard nothing from anybody, so we are all good.” The volcano observatory did a retrospective analysis of earthquake data near Mount Edgecumbe, which showed a small number of earthquakes started occurring in 2020. There’s been about 40 quakes that were located in the area in the last two years, about one or two a month, far less than what’s been recorded this week. “You would expect many, many earthquakes to be observed prior to any eruptive activity if it were to occur,” Schneider said. “Earthquake activity is our best indicator of what’s going on there, and that’s something that we’ll be watching closely.” Alaska has about 90 volcanoes that have been active in the last 10,000 years, he said. Most are remote and not usually near a population center like Sitka, which has about 8,500 residents. There’s no written record of Mount Edgecumbe erupting, but he said there is Tlingit oral history about small eruptions about 800 years ago. The last Mount Edgecumbe eruption preserved in the geologic record was about 4,500 years ago. There’s also evidence of a large eruption 13,000 to 14,500 years ago where up to 3 feet (1 meter) of ash was deposited on what is now Sitka, while 98 feet (30 meters) fell on Kruzof Island.",U.S./Associated Press,Earthquakes recorded near Alaska volcano dormant 800 years,https://news.yahoo.com/earthquakes-recorded-near-alaska-volcano-231211825.html
4/15/2022,"Last year, the monstrous Bernardinelli-Bernstein comet (also known as C/2014 UN271) was discovered by the eponymous University of Pennsylvania astronomers Gary Bernstein and Pedro Bernardinelli. The pair called it the “nearly spherical cow of comets” in their paper about the discovery, but it wasn’t long until the world dubbed it the “megacomet” for being an absolute unit of a space object. While the megacomet fell out of the main space news spotlight, NASA astronomers set the the Hubble Space Telescope’s sights on the object in the months since—and discovered how truly immense it is. A new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters on Tuesday confirmed that Bernardinelli-Bernstein had a nucleus—the icy core at the center of all comets—that’s more than 80 miles wide. That’s roughly 50 times larger than other comets and the largest ever observed. “This comet is literally the tip of the iceberg for many thousands of comets that are too faint to see in the more distant parts of the solar system,” David Jewitt, a professor of planetary science and astronomy at the UCLA and co-author of the study, said in a NASA press release. “We've always suspected this comet had to be big because it is so bright at such a large distance. Now we confirm it is.” Even with the imagery provided by the Hubble, scientists still had their work cut out for them in sussing out its precise size. After all, the megacomet is still incredibly far away. So the team had to process images taken of the comet by the Hubble in a computer model, which gave them an approximate estimation of its mass. Now astronomers can confirm that the Bernardinelli-Bernstein comet is much larger than any other comet ever discovered. The previous record was held by C/2002 VQ94, which had a nucleus that’s a mere 60 miles across. A size comparison of the Benardinelli-Bernstein comet's nucleus to other notable comets. Disconcertingly, the megacomet is on an interstellar road trip that’ll bring it right through our solar system in 2031. Luckily for us, it’s not expected to get any closer than a billion miles away from the sun, passing between Saturn and Uranus’ respective orbits. This won’t be the first time it’s made such a trip either since most comets observed originated from the collision of space rocks that created Earth long ago. In fact, the megacomet is following a 3-million-year-long elliptical orbit—so it’s been a minute since we’ve seen it last. Its next approach in nine years will provide astronomers with a very rare opportunity to closely study an object that might still contain remnants from the early solar system. With the mighty James Webb Space Telescope unfurled and in orbit, there’s a chance we could get an even more in-depth look at the comet than we ever have before. “It’s pristine,” Bernardinelli told The Daily Beast last year. “Not a lot has happened to this object since its formation in the early days of the solar system, and so we can think of it as a window into the past.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

4/15/2022,"* Finland and Sweden consider NATO membership * Russia warns of nuclear deployment * Says Iskander and hypersonic missiles would be deployed * Lithuania says there's nothing new in Russia's threats (Recasts headline and lead) By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON, April 14 (Reuters) - One of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies warned NATO on Thursday that if Sweden and Finland joined the U.S.-led military alliance then Russia would deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in an exclave in the heart of Europe. Finland, which shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia, and Sweden are considering joining the NATO alliance. Finland will decide in the next few weeks, Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on Wednesday. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said that should Sweden and Finland join NATO then Russia would have to strengthen its land, naval and air forces in the Baltic Sea. Medvedev also explicitly raised the nuclear threat by saying that there could be no more talk of a ""nuclear free"" Baltic - where Russia has its Kaliningrad exclave sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. ""There can be no more talk of any nuclear–free status for the Baltic - the balance must be restored,"" said Medvedev, who was Russian president from 2008 to 2012. Medvedev said he hoped Finland and Sweden would see sense. If not, he said, they would have to live with nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles close to home. Russia has the world's biggest arsenal of nuclear warheads and along with China and the United States is one of the global leaders in hypersonic missile technology. Lithuania said Russia's threats were nothing new and that Moscow had deployed nuclear weapons to Kaliningrad long before the war in Ukraine. NATO did not immediately respond to Russia's warning. Still, the possible accession of Finland and Sweden into NATO - founded in 1949 to provide Western security against the Soviet Union - would be one of the biggest strategic consequences of the war in Ukraine. Finland gained independence from Russia in 1917 and fought two wars against it during World War Two during which it lost some territory. On Thursday, Finland announced a military exercise in Western Finland with the participation of Britain, the United States, Latvia and Estonia. Sweden has not fought a war for 200 years. Foreign policy has focused on supporting democracy and nuclear disarmament. KALININGRAD Kaliningrad, formerly the port of Koenigsberg, capital of East Prussia, lies less than 1,400 km from London and Paris and 500 km from Berlin. Russia said in 2018 it had deployed Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad, which was captured by the Red Army in April 1945 and ceded to the Soviet Union at the Potsdam conference. The Iskander, known as SS-26 Stone by NATO, is a short-range tactical ballistic missile system that can carry nuclear warheads. Its official range is 500 km but some Western military sources suspect it may be much greater. ""No sane person wants higher prices and higher taxes, increased tensions along borders, Iskanders, hypersonics and ships with nuclear weapons literally at arm's length from their own home,"" Medvedev said. ""Let's hope that the common sense of our northern neighbours will win."" While Putin is Russia's paramount leader, Medvedev's comments reflect Kremlin thinking and he is a senior member of the security council - one of Putin's main chambers for decision making on strategic issues. Lithuanian Defence Minister Arvydas Anusauskas said Russia had deployed nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad even before the war. ""Nuclear weapons have always been kept in Kaliningrad ... the international community, the countries in the region, are perfectly aware of this,"" Anusauskas was quoted as saying by BNS. ""They use it as a threat."" Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced millions and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States - by far the world's two biggest nuclear powers. Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the persecution of Russian-speaking people. Ukraine says it is fighting an imperial-style land grab and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense. U.S. President Joe Biden says Putin is a war criminal and a dictator. Putin says the conflict in Ukraine as part of a much broader confrontation with the United States which he says is trying to enforce its hegemony even as its dominance over the international order declines.

4/15/2022,"The Michigan Attorney General’s office has charged a off-duty DeWitt police officer with felony charges connected to a 2021 incident with a Black teen, where he pulled a gun out on him twice without reasonable cause. The teen also has secured legal representation and filed his own federal civil lawsuit. According to a press release from the state attorney general Dana Nessel, officer Chad Vorce was arraigned on Thursday, April 7, on the below: One count of misconduct in office, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and/or $10,000 Felonious assault with a dangerous weapon, a felony punishable by up to four years in prison and/or $2,000 Felony firearm possession: a felony punishable by two years consecutively with and preceding any term of imprisonment imposed for the felony or attempted felony conviction in a Clinton County District Court. Vorce initially was fired for these crimes, but reinstated months later after the department said “he has learned his lesson” and showed a “genuine demonstration of remorse” for his actions. The state believes a court of law should determine this. The AG’s investigation found Vorce, who was not on duty at the time of the incident, broke the law when he pulled a gun out on Alexander Hamilton, a 19-year-old paperboy on Jan. 14, 2021, despite his belief the boy was “driving erratically in his neighborhood.” Nessel said, “Our assessment of this incident showed dangerous behavior exhibited by Mr. Vorce. Those who swear to protect and serve must do so responsibly. We will not hesitate to hold accountable those who violate that oath.” A day after these charges were made, Hamilton filed his own federal lawsuit, alleging the 18-year-veteran officer and his colleagues violated his Fourth and 14th Amendment rights by the use of excessive force, illegal seizure, false arrest and false imprisonment on that early spring morning. He also alleged these state authorities racially discriminated —pointing to Vorce identifying him by race when reporting the incident to others. The lawsuit, which plays off the young man’s name by using a rendering of the opening song of the Hamilton Broadway musical based on the founding father with the same name, records the teen was on an assigned route to drop off papers when he encountered the off-duty officer. His lawyer Dustyn Coontz explains his client was in the area of Shadybrook Lane and Driftwood Drive, which is in Watertown Township, Clinton County, around 7:15 a.m., on the day of the altercation only to perform his job’s duties. Vorce saw the teen’s minivan while he was taking his child to school and determined he was “driving in a manner that he claims to have been suspicious.” “According to Vorce, there had been some theft-related crimes in his neighborhood recently,” the lawsuit states. “Upon seeing a ‘frickin’ Black guy’ in a black hoodie, Vorce became even more suspicious that Hamilton was a potential criminal.” The officer, who doubled as a volunteer firefighter, approached the teen and asked him what he was doing. Hamilton allegedly responded, “I’m just doing me.” At this point, frustrated he could not get the answer he wanted, nor the van’s plates to run his tags, he called the Clinton County Central Dispatch for assistance. The claim says the first line of the CAD report read — another indicator that race was an issue — “BLK MALE IN THE AREA JUST DOING ME NEEDS CHECKED.” Vorce now started to follow Hamilton in his vehicle. Ultimately, the van backed up on Vorce (twice) and each time, the officer believed this was an attempted assault on him. He reported to “dispatch he was ‘going to go shots fired’ if Hamilton did it again.” Hamilton alleged he was trying to get away, but that Vorce’s vehicle gave him no room for him to make a U-turn. The officer claimed at this time the teen tried to “ram” his truck again, got out of his truck and “pulled his pistol out on Hamilton” the first time. When he returned to his truck, he told dispatch, the lawsuit alleges, “this was now a priority call and that things would ‘turn out really bad’ if help didn’t arrive quickly.” Simultaneously, Hamilton said, fearful for his life, he tried to escape to a public place, the Sunoco (AKA Tailgaters) at 3955 Ernest Way, thinking Vorce would not do anything violent there. Off duty officer Chad Vorce pulled his GUN on a teen who was delivering newspapers and said “when I see a Black guy … I think you’re doing stuff like this.” This use of force & bias is DISGUSTING. Thankfully, the teen was not hurt and Vorce was fired! pic.twitter.com/V8hb0rnmkG — Ben Crump (@AttorneyCrump) November 15, 2021 Vorce continued to challenge the teen, but this time using “wigwagging” headlights” and “emergency light” to represent himself in his occupational capacity. When he emerged from the vehicle, he identified himself as a police officer, before pulling out the gun on Hamilton for the second time. The lawsuit reveals Officer Clyde Smith, a cop that works in the same department as Vorce, arrived at the scene, despite the location of this incident being out of the jurisdiction of the DPD. “Smith has claimed he responded because he was close to the scene and was there to assist Michigan State Police in its investigation and that he didn’t know Vorce was the complainant,” the lawyer writes. “But Smith would’ve known from radio traffic that Vorce—or “7602” or “602,” as dispatch routinely called him—was the complainant.” The filing says Smith removed the delivery driver from his van and started to arrest “him citing the possibility that Hamilton committed assault with a dangerous weapon by trying to ram Vorce.” During this process, Michigan State police trooper Luke Shafer arrived on the scene. He and Smith interviewed both Hamilton and Vorce, but did not stop their colleague from engaging the teen. Shafer later consulted with two other sergeants at the Lansing Post and found there was no basis to arrest Hamilton. Hamilton’s lawsuit names Vorce, Smith, DeWitt police chief Bruce Ferguson and the City of DeWitt as defendants. It claims the ordeal has caused the plaintiff to “suffer emotional distress” and the officer’s actions were “extreme and outrageous.” The city and chief are listed as “Smith was in uniform and responded to the scene in a marked patrol car, so everything he did here was plainly under the color of State Law,” operating with an authority those parties gave him. He is suing for damages for the “emotional and psychological injuries” caused by being exposed to police-involved violence, “punitive damages for the defendants’ intentional and outrageous conduct demonstrating evil motive and a reckless or callous indifference to Hamilton’s rights” and lawyer fees. Hamilton also wants Vorce to be barred from law enforcement “until the day he dies.” Vorce has not answered the lawsuit and is scheduled to appear before Judge Michael E. Clarizio in the 65A District Court.

4/15/2022,"By Pavel Polityuk and Oleksandr Kozhukhar KYIV/LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine warned on Wednesday that Russia was ramping up efforts in the South and East as it seeks full control of Mariupol, in what would be the first major city to fall, while Western governments committed more military help to bolster Kyiv. The Kremlin's nearly seven-week-long incursion, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945, has not gone to plan. Russia has been forced to pull back from some northern areas even as attacks across the country have turned Ukrainian cities to rubble and caused more than 4.6 million people to flee abroad. Russia's defence ministry on Wednesday said 1,026 soldiers from Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, had surrendered in Mariupol, which has been besieged for weeks, and that the port was fully under its control. Capturing its Azovstal industrial district, where the marines have been holed up, would give the Russians full control of Ukraine's main Sea of Azov port, reinforce a southern land corridor and expand its occupation of the country's East. Ukraine's general staff said Russian forces were attacking Azovstal and the port, but a defence ministry spokesman said he had no information about any surrender. ""Russian forces are increasing their activities on the southern and eastern fronts, attempting to avenge their defeats,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Wednesday night video address. Reuters journalists accompanying Russian-backed separatists saw flames billowing from the Azovstal area on Tuesday, a day after Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade said its troops had run out of ammunition. The United States announced on Wednesday an extra $800 million in military assistance including artillery systems, armoured personnel carriers and helicopters. This took total U.S. military aid to more than $2.5 billion. France and Germany also pledged more. Russia will view U.S. and NATO vehicles transporting weapons on Ukrainian territory as legitimate military targets, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the TASS news agency. It will impose tit-for-tat sanctions on 398 members of the U.S. House of Representatives and 87 Canadian senators, Interfax cited the foreign ministry as saying, after Washington targeted 328 members of Russia's lower house of parliament. Britain announced new financial measures on separatists. 'LIBERATE US FROM WHAT?' Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol and accuses Russia of blocking aid convoys to civilians marooned there. Its mayor, Vadym Boichenko, said Russia had brought in mobile crematoria ""to get rid of evidence of war crimes"" - a statement that was not possible to verify. Moscow has blamed Ukraine for civilian deaths and accused Kyiv of denigrating Russian armed forces. In the village of Lubianka northwest of Kyiv, from where Russian forces had tried and failed to subdue the capital before being driven away, a message to Ukrainians had been written on the wall of a house that had been occupied by Russian troops. ""We did not want this ... forgive us,"" it said. The Kremlin says it launched a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""liberate"" Ukraine, a message villagers said had been repeated to them by the Russian troops. ""To liberate us from what? We're peaceful... We're Ukrainians,"" Lubianka resident Viktor Shaposhnikov said. Polish President Andrzej Duda said on a visit to Kyiv with his Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian counterparts that those who had committed and ordered crimes must be brought to justice. Germany's president did not join them as he had planned. Zelenskiy said there had been no official approach and one of his officials denied a newspaper report he had rejected the visit due to Steinmeier's recent good relations with Moscow. BIDEN'S GENOCIDE COMMENTS The Kremlin denounced President Joe Biden's description of Moscow's actions in Ukraine as amounting to genocide, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying this was unacceptable coming from the leader of a country he said had committed crimes of its own. The White House said a legal process will be undertaken. An initial report by a mission of experts set up by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe documents a ""catalogue of inhumanity"" by Russian troops in Ukraine, according to the U.S. ambassador to the OSCE. ""This includes evidence of direct targeting of civilians, attacks on medical facilities, rape, executions, looting and forced deportation of civilians to Russia,"" Michael Carpenter said. Russia has denied targeting civilians and has said Ukrainian and Western allegations of war crimes are fabricated. The Kyiv district police chief said 720 bodies had been found in the region around the capital from where Russian forces had retreated, with more than 200 people missing. International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan said after visiting Bucha, a town where bound bodies of people apparently shot at close range were found, that Ukraine was a ""crime scene"" and this was within ICC jurisdiction. ""We have to pierce the fog of war to get to the truth,” Khan said on Twitter. The mayor of the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest, said bombing had increased significantly on Wednesday and satellite photos from Maxar Technologies showed long columns of armoured vehicles in the region. At least seven people were killed, including a two-year-old boy, and 22 wounded in Kharkiv over the past 24 hours. Ukrainian forces shot down two Russian planes attacking towns in the region, regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said earlier. Reuters could not immediately verify his statement but filmed people in Kharkiv quietly carrying bodies from an apartment block hit by shelling.
