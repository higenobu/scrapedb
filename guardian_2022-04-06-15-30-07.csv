4/6/2022,"Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, has defended an advertising campaign found by the state’s auditor general to be political and not complying with the law, saying he makes no apologies for “standing up for our state”. The Victorian auditor general’s office (Vago) report tabled in parliament on Wednesday found the “Our Fair Share” campaign and several Big Build advertisements breached laws passed in 2017 to stop public sector agencies publishing political advertising. The $1.7m Our Fair Share campaign, which ran from April to June 2019, advocated for more commonwealth funding for Victorian public schools, healthcare and transport projects. It was run by the Department of Education and Training, the Department of Health (which was the Department of Health and Human Services at the time) and the Department of Transport, after discussions with the Premier’s Private Office and the Department of Premier and Cabinet. The campaigns involved advertisements on television, radio, print media and digital platforms, and on “live banners” at football stadiums, and coincided with the 2019 federal election, which was announced on 11 April and held on 18 May. The Vago report found the advertisements were political as they “did more than state facts and data about government funding”. “The statements about the Victorian government appeared to have a positive tone,” Vago said. “They referred to billions of dollars or ‘record levels’ of investment. The statements about ‘Canberra’ were negative. They used language such as ‘cuts’ and ‘miss out’. “Members of the public were likely to find the language in some of the advertisements to be particularly emotive. One of the television advertisements included the line ‘don’t let Canberra short-change our kids.’” Speaking to reporters outside parliament on Wednesday, Andrews stood by the campaign, saying it led to election funding announcements for Melbourne airport rail link and a fast rail connection to Geelong. “No matter who’s in power in Canberra, we will never apologise for standing up for our state,” Andrews said. “We will fight hard to try and get what Victorians are owed and that is a fair share. We are nearly 30% of the country and we’re getting 6% of [new infrastructure funding]. If it weren’t so serious it would be an absolute joke. “The auditor general’s entitled to their view, [but the] government believes we complied with all relevant matters and we wouldn’t hesitate to run that campaign again.” The auditor general found two advertisements from the $11.5m campaign for the Big Build also breached the law as they promoted the works before providing information in the public interest about disruptions. Victoria’s Big Build “Travel Plan B” print advertisement from 2018, for example, gave more space to the projects and their benefits than to the travel disruptions, it said. Vago said the “Summer Blitz” phase, which ran in late 2019 and early 2020, was an improvement, with most of the advertisements striking a “balance between information about the projects and the disruptions”. There were some exceptions – including a 60-second television advertisement that spent 42 seconds describing the Victorian government’s transport projects before mentioning disruptions. Internal records also showed the Department of Transport and the Major Transport Infrastructure Authority tested whether their advertisements had changed perceptions about the Victorian government. One survey included a question about whether the advertisements made them “feel positive” about the government. The government agencies involved in both the campaigns maintained they complied with their obligations. “The conflicting interpretations show the laws are not sufficiently clear. This needs to be remedied,” Vago said in the report. “In addition, the agencies could not show, nor is it clear, that the campaigns were cost-effective.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Vago made seven recommendations, including stronger oversight of government advertising and a better evaluation and reporting process of advertising cost-effectiveness. The opposition leader, Matthew Guy, on Wednesday said the government’s priorities were wrong and Labor should repay the cost of the campaigns. “I don’t see why Victorians should be forced to foot the bill for blatant political advertising,” Guy said. The Victorian government spends at least $80m a year on advertising.",News/Australia news,Daniel Andrews defends Victorian government advertising after audit finds campaigns ‘political’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/daniel-andrews-defends-victorian-government-advertising-after-audit-finds-campaigns-political
4/6/2022,"The Invisible Pilot, HBO’s Adam McKay-produced three-hour docu-series, defies easy classification. It’s part small-town mystery, following the suspicious death of a local crop duster in Hazen, Arkansas, in 1977. It’s part thorny family history, following the ex-wives and children left to grapple with such a foundational, traumatic event. It’s part true crime, as the mystery ropes in drug smugglers, the 80s cocaine trade in Miami, and illegal US weapon deals as part of the Reagan administration’s Iran-contra scandal. And it’s yet another iteration of our evergreen fascination with scams, as the central mystery played out in the first episode – why Gary Betzner, a 36-year-old married father of three, jumped off a bridge while taking his wife and daughter for sundaes in 1977 – is not what it seems. As the first episode aired on Monday (the remaining two will air on HBO weekly), I can say – spoiler alert! – that Gary Betzner did not die in the jump off the Arkansas bridge. In fact, he didn’t jump into the White River at all; a friend took Gary in a pickup truck to Texarkana, where he picked up a motorcycle and drove off to California as a fugitive. Facing up to 20 years in prison on federal drug charges for smuggling marijuana and cocaine in Florida, and another drug possession charge in Arkansas (Gary says he self-medicated gout with cocaine), he and his wife, Sally, staged the suicide (with the help of hypnosis, if you can believe it). Their two young children, Travis and Sara Lee, didn’t know their dad survived. Neither did his first wife and his eldest daughter, Polly, who were never privy to the plan. The twist arrives halfway through the first episode, which until that point plays out as a standard small-town true crime mystery featuring interviews with Sally, Travis, Sara Lee and Polly over several years, from 2009 onwards. And then Gary appears – very much alive, with hangdog charm and a glint of pride, as the main narrator of a bizarre story from small-town Arkansas crop duster to expert cocaine smuggler for Pablo Escobar to incarcerated White House whistleblower. The shocking first episode twist – I, like apparently most of Hazen in the early 80s, believed Gary died in 1977 – was an intentional bait-and-switch to “play with the audience’s expectations”, said Ari Mark, who co-directed the series with Phil Lott. “If you’re not invested in the disappearance of this guy, then we’re not going to be able to get you past that point to be able to start asking more questions about his smuggling” and involvement in the Iran-contra scandal. “The hoax is just the tip of the iceberg, but then it’s the ultimate hoax from a more political level,” he added. The faux death “has a reason, and it’s not just to confuse you and it’s not just to throw you to the left so we can bring you back to the right. Hopefully, you get some trust from the audience there, because it’s not us doing it. It’s actually what happened.” The series, over the course of three hours, aims to explore deception at the highest level – the “war on drugs” Reagan administration’s use of drug smugglers for foreign policy influence – and on the most personal level, as interviews with the Betzner family conducted over 12 years evince the toll of Gary’s Don Draper-esque charade. “People don’t disappear into thin air,” said Mark. “And people have families who care about them, and when somebody disappears, they leave a void. How is that possible?” The stranger-than-fiction story came to Mark and Lott more than a decade ago. Lott was attending the Sonoma film festival and met a screenwriter, Jon Crawford, who was writing a fictional account of the story. Crawford put a stunned Lott in touch with Craig Hodges, a childhood friend of Travis Betzner who had been filming Travis and his family on and off for years as part of his own documentary project. Hodges, an executive producer on The Invisible Pilot and on-screen presence (he shows off a room with boxes on boxes of research, dating back to when Travis first told him of his father’s death in middle school), provided the HBO team with footage of parallel interviews conducted over several years, woven into and echoed throughout their own filming. Working with Hodges’s original interviews and reporting, Mark and Lott re-reported, filmed and factchecked a full timeline of Gary Betzner’s double life – his brief era as a California hippy, near-decade as a prolific cocaine smuggler, and the long shadow his deceptions cast over the family. “We organized this story in a way that I think connects all the dots for the first time in everyone’s heads,” said Lott. The goal was to “make the audience feel like they’re a part of that journey,” said Mark, “and make them feel like they’re going from A to Z with Gary, and really defy expectations along the way”. Each episode of The Invisible Pilot leans into different documentary subgenres, with attendant tone shifts. The first is more cold case file, with a serious focus on the memories of each family member, consistent across a decade of interviews edited together. The second is a more rollicking ride through the Miami Vice era of drug smuggling over the Caribbean. The third skews educational, with explainers on Iran-contra from the journalist and Slow Burn podcast host Leon Neyfakh, and plenty of archival footage of Washington in the 1980s. (Very briefly, as it is confusing: the US government secretly sold weapons to Iran, breaking an embargo at the time, purportedly with the intention to help coax the Iranian government to release American hostages. The proceeds secretly funded contra guerrillas fighting the leftwing government in Nicaragua; the CIA covertly used drug smugglers such as Gary Betzner to deliver weapons amid their smuggling routes.) The genre-bending mashups are partly thanks to Adam McKay, director of Don’t Look Up and executive producer of Succession, whose company Hyperobject Industries signed on as an executive producer of the series. The partnership “helped us solidify tone”, said Mark. “We can go a little quirky, we can go a little dark. We can go a little heavy into character. That combination helped a lot to solidify what the DNA of the show is.” “If we had to think of a film-maker who would make this film, it would be Adam McKay,” said Lott. Similarly difficult to clearly define are Gary’s political views, which morph over the course of his story from anti-government (specifically, anti-drug enforcement) to patriotic and settles somewhere around libertarian. “You keep wanting to pin it down,” said Mark. “You keep wanting to be like, ‘well, what’s your political statement? What are you saying?’ And at the end of the day, I think it’s pretty elusive.” But regardless of Gary’s views on his past decisions, Mark finds something “quintessentially American” about the story of an Arkansas crop duster and expert pilot who starts over as a drug smuggler, makes millions and then loses it, and reinvents himself again as a truth-telling whistleblower to Congress. “There’s something just innately patriotic about that idea, about ‘I’m an American male, and I can do whatever the hell I want,’” said Mark. “Hate it or love it, I think it’s a real thing that’s wrapped up in American identity.” The Invisible Pilot fashions Gary as somewhat of a real-life prestige TV antihero, one who hurts those closest to him – Sally and Polly are particularly eloquent on this – but penetrates the shadowy upper echelons of American government. “I hope that feels bizarrely aspirational,” said Mark. “If this could be Forrest Gump meets American Made meets All the President’s Men, we’ve done our job.” The Invisible Pilot airs Mondays on HBO with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Television & radio,‘People don’t disappear into thin air’: behind shocking docuseries The Invisible Pilot,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/06/invisible-pilot-docuseries-hbo
4/6/2022,"Women in the UK were paid just 90p for every £1 earned by a man, according to the latest figures released through the government’s gender pay gap reporting mechanism. Among those high-profile companies reporting particularly large gender gaps was easyJet. According to data filed by the company’s larger arm, Easyjet Airline Company, women’s median wage stood at just 36p for every £1 that men earned last year. Other companies reporting that median male earnings were at least double that of female employees include HSBC Bank along with several academy trusts. A spokesperson for easyJet said its “gender pay submission does not represent a complete picture because the data in April 2021 included pilots, while the majority of our predominantly female UK cabin crew community remained on furlough”. Analysis carried out by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) found the sector with the largest gender median pay gap was construction, where female employees received just 76p for every £1 earned by a man. The median gap in the financial and insurance sector is equivalent to women receiving 88p compared with a male counterpart while women working in information and communication received 83p for every pound earned by a man. The smallest gaps are in human health and social work activities, equivalent to 98p for every £1; arts, entertainment, and recreation (96p), and transportation and storage (95p). Charles Cotton, senior policy adviser for reward and recognition with the CIPD, said the “figures show that very little has changed when it comes to addressing the gender pay gap in Great Britain”. He added: “Employers shouldn’t just report the numbers; instead they need to understand the reason for any gap and be transparent about how they plan to tackle it.” While all companies and organisations with 250 or more employees are required to file a gender pay gap report, the number of organisations reporting has fallen compared with before the pandemic, from about 9,000 to 8,200 in the latest reporting period. The gap between the median hourly rate received by men and women in the UK actually improved slightly versus the previous year, shrinking from 10.2% in the last reporting period to 9.8% in 2021/22. However, recent years’ figures may have been affected by the Covid crisis: reporting for 2019/20 was scrapped while last year’s deadline was changed from a spring deadline to October to facilitate businesses affected by the pandemic. The median hourly pay gap does not address the gap in similar job roles and, due to exemptions, some high-level executives including partners, and some non-employees, typically low-paid workers, are not included in the data. The easyJet spokesperson said: “We have always been clear that our gender pay gap is not a result of unequal pay but of gender balance in our pilot community, which is predominantly male. “This is a known, industry-wide challenge that will take many years to reverse and one which we have been actively trying to tackle for a number of years.” When its larger and smaller arms were combined, however, the overall median gender pay gap was 41p versus £1, rather than 36p, the spokesperson said.",News/World news,UK gender pay gap: women paid 90p for £1 earned by men,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/uk-gender-pay-gap-women-paid-90p-for-1-earned-by-men
4/6/2022,"Here is just a small list of things I think should be prohibitively expensive: imported flowers, leaf blowers, portable speakers, Frank Sinatra albums and bleach. Here is a list of things I think should be free: childcare, access to woodland, water in pubs, healthcare, ketchup at chip shops and lateral flow tests. And somewhere between the two sits milk. Michael Oakes, chair of the national dairy board of the National Farmers’ Union, told the Today programme this week that rising costs in fuel, fertilisers and animal feed have made dairy farming unsustainable for many people in the UK. Farmers are leaving the sector, getting into terrible debt and worse. As a result of these rising costs, we are likely to see an increase in the price of milk, as well as butter, cheese, yoghurt and everything else that would make up about 85% of my four-year-old son’s diet if he had his way. While this is obviously going to be a huge issue for people on low incomes – especially parents and older people with mid-century appetites – it is also perhaps time. I don’t want to walk into a bear fight covered in honey here but, like many people, I believe that farmers should be paid fairly, supermarkets shouldn’t be able to squeeze every drop of profit out of food producers and more of us should start to see milk – all dairy – as a luxury. I come from a pretty dairy-oriented family. I remember visiting cows with my vet grandad, pushing my entire arm up a cow’s clenching orifice to feel if it was pregnant, drinking a pint of silver top through a straw in front of Neighbours. I am now very lucky to be able to have my milk delivered, in glass bottles, alongside oat milk, orange juice and, if my partner logs in to the website, something called a “chocolate bomb”. I can, at the moment, afford it. That is a privilege that many people do not share. But it is also true that, ethically, environmentally and morally, I can only ignore the questionable effects of dairy farming on rivers, the earth and individual animals for so long. I may, in my heart, remain a cream-faced fool, but I also know that, as a planet, we can no longer afford cheap milk. Nell Frizzell is the author of The Panic Years, out now through Bantam Press.

4/6/2022,"HM Revenue & Customs has sprung a cruel April fool trick on me and potentially millions of other self-employed citizens. Until now, it has operated a system called Gov.uk Verify which allows people to confirm their identity via the Post Office or Experian, using a driving licence or credit records. This was vital to enable those of us who don’t have a UK passport to access government services, including self-assessment tax accounts. HMRC now informs me that, from 1 April, I can no longer use my Gov.uk Verify account to sign in to HMRC digital services. Instead, I’ve been told to set up a “Government Gateway” account. To do this, applicants have to have two items from a list of acceptable ID – a UK passport, pay slip, tax credit or a Northern Ireland driving licence. I don’t have any of these. When I called HMRC, an agent told me he was in the same situation. I was referred to the self-assessment team which was unaware of the change, and advised that I would have to revert to paper tax returns, which, the agent told me, was absurd as the government is trying to encourage all returns to be filed online.LW, Todmorden The demise of the £200m Gov.uk Verify programme was announced last year, eight years after its launch. The government promised that users could continue to access it until April 2023 while it worked on an alternative digital identity scheme spanning all departments. That’s precisely what Verify was meant to do, but HMRC decided to set up its own sign-in system and is now dropping Verify a year early. Not that you would have known it. The Gov.uk Verify website said only the Department for Work and Pensions had stopped using it from this month. This was changed after contact with the Observer. HMRC doesn’t appear to have a back-up plan to help those in your situation. It told me it was looking at ways to make the Government Gateway more accessible. “There is a balance to strike between making things as straightforward as possible for customers, and stopping fraudsters,” said a spokesperson, who advised those in your situation to return to the 20th century and submit your tax return on paper. Extraordinarily, it claimed that only Northern Ireland driving licences were acceptable ID because the DVLA did not permit HMRC to access British drivers’ records. Why?

4/6/2022,"It would, activists testify, restore the public’s waning trust in vital US institutions, curb the corrupting influence of big money in politics and give America’s ailing democracy a much-needed shot in the arm. It is also, they acknowledge, dead on arrival. An amendment to the US constitution was last week proposed by Congressman Adam Schiff to overturn a 2010 precedent set by the supreme court, known as Citizens United, which opened the floodgates for corporations and special interests to pour billions of dollars into election campaigns. Passing the amendment would, Schiff argues, enable Congress or individual states to propose reasonable limits on private campaign contributions and independent expenditures. “Let’s get dark money out of our democracy,” he tweeted. “And return power to the people.” Such a move has broad public support in America but little chance of getting through Congress itself. Amending the constitution requires support from a two-thirds majority in both the House of Representatives and Senate plus ratification by three-quarters of state legislatures. In today’s polarised America, where few Republicans have displayed an appetite for campaign finance reform, that remains a non-starter. Democrats including Schiff himself have made previous attempts at constitutional amendments and got nowhere. Citizens United appears to be here to stay. Its origins lie in a challenge to campaign finance rules by Citizens United, a conservative non-profit group, after the Federal Election Commission refused to allow it to broadcast a film criti­cising candid­ate Hillary Clin­ton too close to the Democratic pres­id­en­tial primar­ies. In one of the most controversial decisions in its history, the supreme court ruled 5-4 in Citizens United’s favor with Justice Anthony Kennedy writing that limit­ing “inde­pend­ent polit­ical spend­ing” from corpor­a­tions and other special interest groups viol­ates the first amend­ment right to free speech. It opened the way for them to spend unlim­ited money on elec­tion campaigns. In the 12 years since, outside groups have spent more than $4.4bn in federal elections – almost $1bn of which was “dark money”, typically through non-profits that do not disclose their donors. The biggest contributors have included banks, the pharmaceutical industry and the National Rifle Association (NRA). “Citizens United has been a disaster for the American political system even beyond what we expected,” said Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) “We knew it was bad when it happened but the amount of money going into the political system has exploded since that decision, including a massive expansion in third-party spending, particularly unaccountable dark money spending.” The supreme court’s majority opinion in 2010 had assumed that outside spending would be inherently transparent and free from corruption. It has been proven wrong, Bookbinder argues, as the money is funneled through non-profits or shell corporations that conceal its origins. “So much of that money comes from sources that are difficult or impossible to identify. The public doesn’t know who’s responsible for this money in American politics. It’s been catastrophic and it does need to be fixed.” This, campaigners say, has had a corrosive effect on democracy and explains why politicians who benefit from the money so often fail to tackle healthcare reform, gun control, the climate crisis and other urgent issues. Bookbinder added: “It certainly does give more power to powerful interests like the fossil fuel companies, the drug companies, the major banks and all the biggest money industries as well as individual billionaires who can put a great deal of money into the political system, often in ways that the public doesn’t know about but that elected officials do know about and feel beholden to. “That’s a real problem. When you see a lack of progress on issues like climate change, how much of that is due to the fact that so many elected officials are beholden to powerful figures connected to industries that don’t want progress?” This, in turn, feeds public frustration with Washington a place where nothing gets done except measures that favour the rich and powerful – a recipe for voters to turn to outsider candidates such as Donald Trump who promise to shake up the system and “drain the swamp”. Bookbinder said: “The other piece that is really dangerous is that the American people understand that there is so much money going into politics from very wealthy people and from industries and they feel like the democracy is not working for them. “It makes people lose their faith in democracy and become more willing potentially to either support leaders who don’t believe necessarily in democracy – we’ve seen that in recent years – or to be less concerned with defending the democracy from threats. That’s another way in which it can be kind of existential in the effect that it has.” Pacs (polit­ical action commit­tees) raise and spend money for campaigns that support or attack polit­ical candid­ates or legis­la­tion. Pacs are allowed to donate directly to a candid­ate’s offi­cial campaign but subject to limits on what contributions they can give or receive. In the wake of Citizens United, however, a federal appeals court ruled that outside groups could accept unlim­ited contri­bu­tions as long as they do not give directly to candid­ates. These Super Pacs are allowed to spend money to endorse or oppose candid­ates with adverts that are produced independently. But Karen Hobert Flynn, president of the democracy reform group Common Cause, said: “The reality since that decision shows that it is not necessarily independent – we see lots of coordination between candidates and Super Pacs – and it causes enormous damage to our imperfect democracy where wealthy mega-donors, corporations, special interest groups not only impact and influence elections but, once elected, lawmakers feel like they need to grant favours for those who funded their campaigns.” Super Pacs are obliged to disclose their donors but these can include non-profits which make the original source of the money hard to track. More than 2,000 Super Pacs operated in each of the last two election cycles. The negative consequences have been felt not only in Washington but at state level, added Flynn, whose long fight for campaign finance reform in Connecticut bore fruit in 2008. “It has created a huge amount of cynicism that Congress and state legislatures are corrupt because they benefit from outside groups spending money on their behalf and that people’s voices do not matter. “The money has also led to further polarisation, driving more extreme kinds of measures, particularly on the right where we’ve seen money supporting those who want to overturn a fair and free election. If you look at the top 10 Super Pacs and their outside spending so far just in 2022, you’ll see nine out of the top 10 Super Pacs are conservative or support Republican candidates. It isn’t like, ‘Hey, both sides do it and it’s equal and it’s not a problem.’” Super Pacs are not all-powerful. Jeb Bush enjoyed their backing to the tune of $100m in 2016 but was defeated for the Republican nomination by Donald Trump’s improvised insurgent campaign. Everyone from Trump to Bernie Sanders to Marjorie Taylor Greene has shown the potency of small donations. And Congress could still take action. Its recently proposed Free­dom to Vote Act would have ensured that Super Pacs are truly inde­pend­ent and illuminated “dark money” by requir­ing any entity that spends more than $10,000 in an elec­tion to disclose all major donors. But the legislation stalled in the evenly divided Senate after Democrats Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema rejected efforts to reform a procedural rule known as the filibuster, which would have enabled their party to thwart Republican opposition. A dark money group had run a $1m ad campaign in Manchin’s home state of West Virginia to pressure him to keep the filibuster intact. For critics of Citizens United, it was back to the drawing board once more. Rio Tazewell, director of strategy at People for the American Way, said: “Unfortunately there are very limited options in terms of what can be done. The supreme court could decide to weigh in on another case and reverse itself; given the current makeup of the court for the foreseeable future, that does seem unlikely.” But Tazewell noted that 22 states and more than 830 municipal localities have passed resolutions supporting a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. “There’s a lot of pressure building and coalition building that’s happening so that we can ultimately get the type of bipartisan support that we probably will need to pass an amendment,” he added. “Ultimately, I think the most realistic solution – and possible, perhaps not overnight – is for there to be somewhat of a sea change at the national level and a greater recognition that this is not and should not be a partisan issue.”",News/US news,Dark money: the quixotic quest to clean up US campaign financing,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/06/dark-money-campaign-financing-citizens-united
4/6/2022,"Modernism – which can be loosely defined as a movement that marked a break with the past – radically changed art, literature, performance and the built environment. It got a big break in 1922 with the publication of James Joyce’s Ulysses and TS Eliot’s The Waste Land. Eliot’s mentor, Ezra Pound, called it “year zero” on his calendar – though not because of poetry or art but because his hero, the fascist leader Benito Mussolini, marched on Rome. The 1920s were also when Frank Pick and Charles Holden began to redesign the London underground and new ideas about architecture began to flow in from Germany and the Nordic countries. From office blocks built for the glassmaker Pilkington in St Helens, Merseyside, to a Mormon church in Belfast to Cornwall’s Saltash Library (dubbed “the most Le Corbusier building in the country”), modern buildings enliven civic spaces that would be far duller without them. The UK is also home to modernist trains, parks and gardens, piers, cinemas, service stations, factories and fonts. The ubiquity of modernism’s influence makes it a wonderful means of opening up parts of the country you might otherwise bypass or ignore. Here are a dozen events and key landmarks to celebrate the centennial. Fragments is a celebration of the 100th anniversary of the modernist classic The Waste Land, including talks, readings, video, and live music from diverse cultures, taking place in 22 churches across the City of London.

While the lido is usually described as art deco, Plymouth city centre is often called “late classicism”, while some see Armada Way and its buildings as half-baked brutalism. In his newly published gazetteer, Modern Buildings in Britain, author Owen Hatherley describes Piccadilly Circus station – built between 1925 and 1928 by Charles Holden – as a “sort of heavenly anteroom in a perpetual rotating motion”. Take a modernism-themed ride on the underground, stopping to admire the stations at Arnos Grove, Barking, Chiswick Park, Loughton and the Central line’s Hainault Loop, as well as more recent modernist-influenced efforts, such as Canary Wharf and Westminster on the Jubilee line. This National Trust property was designed by the architect Patrick Gwynne for his family and completed in the summer of 1938. Gwynne lived in the house until his death in 2003. The villa is a masterwork of domestic modernism, with a dreamy woodland garden designed to suggest the layers of a painting.Reopens to the public for tours from 23 April. Adults £11, children £5.50, nationaltrust.org.uk The great port city has lots of fine modern buildings, from the tunnel ventilation shafts to the Tate & Lyle Sugar Silo at Huskisson Dock to Speke Aerodrome (now a hotel). Hope Street is a lovely street to walk along, drink or dine on (it’s one of Liverpool’s chief gastronomic gauntlets), and bookending its fine Georgian townhouses are the dashing, wigwam-shaped Metropolitan Cathedral, Everyman theatre, Philharmonic Hall, and Giles Gilbert Scott’s Anglican Cathedral – a sublime melding of neo-Gothic and modernism.",Lifestyle/Travel,12 destinations marking the arrival of modernist Britain,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/06/12-destinations-marking-the-arrival-of-modernist-britain
4/6/2022,"False and conspiratorial narratives pushed by some American conservative politicians and media figures about Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine have bolstered and created synergies with the Kremlin’s legendary disinformation machine, experts on information manipulation say. But even though Russia has embraced and promoted American disinformation, as well as the Kremlin’s own much larger stock of Ukraine war falsehoods, both brands have been widely debunked by experts and most media outlets, underscoring Moscow’s setbacks in the information war. Led by Tucker Carlson at Fox News, a few Republican rightwingers in Congress, and some key conservative activists, a spate of comments that have disparaged Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and echoed other Russian war disinformation have been recycled by Moscow, say experts. A feedback loop between the Kremlin and parts of the American right has been palpable since the war’s start in February, which Moscow falsely labeled as a “special military operation” aimed at stopping “genocide” of Russians in Ukraine and “denazification” – two patently bogus charges that drew widespread international criticism. Still, the influential figure of Carlson has pushed several false narratives to millions of Fox News viewers that have been eagerly embraced and recycled by Moscow and parts of the American right. Last month, for example, Carlson touted rightwing conspiracies that attempted to link Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, to a discredited allegation that the US financed bioweapons labs in Ukraine. On a separate front, two Republican congressional conservatives, Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene, delighted Moscow last month by condemning Zelenskiy without evidence in conspiracy-ridden terms that sparked some bipartisan criticism. Cawthorn called Zelenskiy a “thug” and his government “incredibly corrupt”, while Greene similarly charged that Zelenskiy was “corrupt”. Further, the former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat, last month attempted to soften and spin Putin’s onerous crackdown on independent media in Russia, where reporters and other citizens now can face prison terms of 15 years for not toeing the Kremlin’s Orwellian war line and spreading what Moscow deems “fake” news about its Ukraine invasion. Gabbard made the wild claim that “what we’re seeing happening here [in America] is not so different from what we’re seeing happening in Russia”. More recently, Russian state TV lauded Gabbard as “our friend Tulsi”, when it introduced a Carlson interview with her in which Gabbard accused Biden of “lying” about his true motives in Ukraine after Biden said in Warsaw that Putin “cannot remain in power”, which the White House quickly clarified was not a call for regime for change. Disinformation specialists say that the phoney narratives by the US right and the Kremlin during the war have displayed some new twists that have increased the flow of conspiracy-heavy news, but also spurred more criticism from experts for being patently false. “We often see a two-way flow of conspiratorial narratives moving from the rightwing American information ecosystem to the Kremlin and back again, in a way that creates a feedback loop that reinforces and bolsters messaging from both groups,” said Bret Schafer, who leads the Alliance for Securing Democracy’s information manipulation team. Schafer noted the feedback loop seems “best evidenced by the recent effort to connect Hunter Biden to a US-led bioweapons program in Ukraine, where one can clearly see the merging of a favored domestic narrative into a foreign disinformation campaign that makes it feel more familiar, and therefore more plausible, to certain target audiences”. Schafer added that “influential American pundits and conspiracy theorists first pushed the narrative, only to then have it amplified and legitimized at the highest levels of the Russian government”. Some members of Congress likewise see a crossover effect between elements of the American right and Moscow. “Putin and his oligarchs are well aware of the dark channels of influence in rightwing American politics today, and they exploit them whenever they can – just as corporations and rightwing billionaires do here at home,” the Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehouse told the Guardian. “There’s also a clear affinity for Putinesque strongmen in some corners of the Republican party, which begins with Trump. All this points to the need for more transparency to help the American people understand who’s influencing their politics and why,” Whitehouse added. But despite the Kremlin’s track record for creating vast amounts of misleading disinformation, and its current efforts at spreading new conspiracies, some former US officials say Moscow has largely failed in its attempts to distort facts as it wages a brutal war. “I think they’ve utterly failed internationally with their disinformation efforts,” former US ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst told the Guardian. “I think they’ve failed in Ukraine, too. Russia has lost the information war.” Herbst stressed that Zelenskiy’s “excellent” messaging skills have been a key antidote to the Kremlin’s latest disinformation war, coupled with heavy western media coverage inside Ukraine of Russia’s well-documented attacks on civilians, medical facilities and brutal war tactics that are being investigated by the international criminal court and others as potential war crimes. “That’s one reason Putin has resorted to draconian steps against the remaining spaces of free media,” added Herbst. Moscow is highly unlikely to give up promoting more false narratives to confuse and rally Russian and American war supporters, as Putin demonstrated in late March with a bizarre riff about “cancel culture” targeting Russian artists to punish the Kremlin for its war against Ukraine and pressure Russian cultural figures to denounce it. Putin likened these efforts to attacks on author JK Rowling for her views on transgender issues, which spurred the author to quip that “critiques of western cancel culture are possibly not best made by those currently slaughtering civilians for the crime of resistance, or who jail and poison their critics”. Schafer said that “criticism of cancel culture, big tech censorship and the mainstream media have long been staples of Russian propaganda targeting audiences on the American political right and the fringes of the ‘anti-imperialist’ political left,” and stressed that these themes have “proven to be wildly successful at attracting American audiences in the past”. Schafer noted, however, that “there is significant irony in media outlets and pundits funded by a government that has systematically destroyed freedom of speech and freedom of the press for 140 million Russian citizens decrying censorship in the west. But that irony is either lost, or ignored, by external audiences attracted to the message.” More broadly, Herbst emphasized that Putin’s supporters among some Trump Republican loyalists and “Trump-minded media” have often “pursued themes that indicate ignorance of Ukraine and insufficient understanding of the dangers that Putin’s aggressive foreign policy poses to vital American interests”. Judging the impact of the feedback loop between Moscow and parts of the American right is “always exceptionally challenging”, Schafer said. But “if the same narratives are being repeated by influential political figures and pundits on the most-watched news networks in Russia and the United States, those narratives are reaching a significant audience”. He added: “Given that many within those audiences have been primed to dismiss and distrust the ‘mainstream’ media and expertise writ large, there’s no amount of factchecking and objective reporting that is likely to change attitudes once certain falsehoods become adopted as facts.”",News/US news,"US right wing in step with Kremlin over Ukraine disinformation, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/06/us-right-wing-republicans-russia-ukraine-disinformation
4/6/2022,"Staff at more than 50 Amazon warehouses have contacted the organizers of last week’s historic vote establishing Amazon’s first-ever union, expressing interest in setting up unions of their own. “The revolution is here,” said Chris Smalls, who helped coordinate the triumphant campaign at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island, New York. In a win that shocked labor organizers and observers, Smalls and his co-organizer Derrick Palmers succeeded where many other attempts had failed, winning a staff-wide vote to establish the union by 2,654 to 2,131. The union is a first for Amazon, which is the second largest employer in the US and fought hard to prevent the result. The company launched a multimillion-dollar campaign to stop their efforts, which began in March 2020 when Smalls led a walkout at a Staten Island warehouse over pandemic working conditions. He was laid off the same day. Amazon alleged that Smalls violated quarantine requirements; Smalls says he was dismissed as retaliation for his protest. His firing sparked widespread outrage on social media, including from political figures such as the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders. Smalls went on to form the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), a group of current and former Amazon employees seeking to unionize. For the next two years, Smalls and Palmer rallied Amazon workers through a series of bonfires, barbecues and other small gatherings near the warehouse. Smalls was a ubiquitous presence at the local bus stop, where he spoke to workers daily. The campaign raised money largely through GoFundMe donations, without major support from top labor organizations. Meanwhile, Amazon escalated its own anti-union efforts, spending more than $4m to fight the campaign. Hired labor consultants delivered anti-union messages to Amazon employees, while a leaked message from Amazon executives discussing their strategy for stalling the union effort described Smalls as “not smart, or articulate”. Amazon even had Smalls and other organizers arrested for trespassing while they were delivering food and union materials to the warehouse parking lot. But the tenacity of the organizers paid off after workers chose to unionize by a margin of more than 500 votes, out of nearly 5,000 employees. A second Amazon warehouse is now set to vote on its own union on 25 April. Smalls and other organizers are beginning the process of negotiating with Amazon management for a contract, and have issued a demand that Amazon desist in hiring or firing while talks continue. They also said they were talking to other groups of Amazon warehouse staff around the country, as well as employees at other businesses, about how to start unions of their own. “The workers that I organize with are like my family now,” Smalls said. “To bring this victory to them is the best feeling in the world next to my kids’ birth.”",News/Technology,‘The revolution is here’: Chris Smalls’ union win sparks a movement at other Amazon warehouses,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/06/chris-smalls-amazon-union-warehouses
4/6/2022,"The news of Channel 4’s privatisation was greeted with the weird reaction that’s sadly become the UK television industry’s response to most decisions the government makes about the media – a simultaneous mix of shock and lack of surprise. Shock because (and this was the theme of the vast majority of respondents to the government’s request for submissions to the “debate” it was keen to have about the network) the channel was a financial and creative success, and still costs the taxpayer absolutely nothing. Over 40 years, it’s proven its worth, bringing exciting new and creative voices to UK television, raising our game internationally, committing itself to independent journalism, and launching the growth of independent production and employment across all the regions. The lack of surprise was because we’ve learned that when the government says it’s keen to have a debate on public service broadcasting, we know it’s keen to have no such thing. At least with Channel 4, the government was polite enough to allow the industry to spend a year and a lot of its time and energy mounting a defence of itself before putting out its pre-decided decision yesterday. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, has been much more efficient with the BBC, getting her decision out early in a tweet announcing the licence fee will be ending but before any discussions have been led or any solutions arrived at, thus putting us all into our misery a lot sooner. Why do they do this? Why do they want to take a thriving, successful British industry, one that puts billions into the economy, and promotes British culture and values internationally – and cut it down? It doesn’t make any business sense, and it’s certainly not patriotic. I regularly get asked by international broadcasters why the UK government has such a destructive agenda against the country’s main television networks. Dorries tweeted yesterday that “government ownership is holding Channel 4 back”, which perhaps explains part of the problem, that she sees the network as some manifestation of the Big State. This certainly was her view when she told the culture select committee last year, wrongly, that the channel benefited from public money. The truth is, though, it’s not the government that owns Channel 4: we, the public, do. Better still, we get it for free. It’s paid for by ad revenue. Channel 4 was brought in under Margaret Thatcher, and it’s arguably a Thatcherite success story. But again and again, the government takes one look at our public service broadcasting, something of which we should be proud, and jabs away at it, cutting it here, attacking it there, talking about “reining it in”, asking it to “watch out”, as it would a surly child, rather than the rather tremendous economic and cultural achievement it actually is. Yes, the streamers like Netflix and Amazon Prime are on the rise, and yes, we need to think about how our public service broadcasting competes, but the solution cannot be to sell a decent part of it overseas. Why? Why, time and time again, does the government want to make our TV worse? The debate on Channel 4 isn’t over. A troublesome passage through parliament awaits a complex bill. Perhaps in keeping with the new tradition of making the conclusion first and only then having the debate, we should see the next year or so as the time in which real questions get asked. Journalists and broadcasters will have time to question ministers, and the crucial questions are: what proportion of the submissions from the industry said privatisation would be a bad idea? Can you lay out the benefits and in some detail? Did any submissions detail disadvantages and can you share them now? How exactly are you going to preserve the channel’s editorial independence and commitment to originality and talent across all the regions, given it will be bought by a business, most likely foreign, with separate commercial commitments to its own shareholders? These are the questions broadcasters need to keep asking. Unfortunately, it comes at a time when any broadcaster asking them could be in receipt of a warning that they’re next.

4/6/2022,"The remains of Mungo Lady, Mungo Man and 106 other ancient Aboriginal people will be reburied in the Willandra Lakes region of New South Wales after a decision by the federal environment minister. Sussan Ley visited Mungo national park, part of the Willandra world heritage area, on Wednesday to announce the government had approved the reburial. “I have determined that the remains can be reburied in the Willandra Lakes region in accordance with the wishes, rights and interests of the local Aboriginal community, represented by the Willandra Lakes Region Aboriginal Advisory Group (AAG),” Ley said. The remains of Mungo Lady and Mungo Man were discovered in 1968 and 1974, respectively, by geologist Jim Bowler, on the dry bed of Lake Mungo. At an estimated 42,000 years old, they are the oldest human remains found in Australia, and among the earliest modern humans discovered anywhere in the world. The burning of Mungo Lady’s body before burial is the oldest known evidence of human cremation. Her remains were returned to Lake Mungo in 1992 and have since been kept in the Mungo national park visitor centre. After being held for more than 40 years by the Australian National University and then the National Museum of Australia, Mungo Man’s remains were returned in 2017. Ley ruled last August that a NSW government proposal to rebury the remains of the Mungos and 106 others at 26 unmarked sites would require formal assessment under national environment law. “Ultimately, what this decision does is respect the wishes of the Aboriginal advisory group who represent the broader tribal groups,” Ley said at an event in Mungo national park on Wednesday. “I believe this is the best decision in the interests of the Willandra world heritage area,” she said. The proposal has been controversial, with some traditional owners opposing the reburial. Michael Young, who played a key role in the repatriation of Mungo Man’s remains in 2017, told Guardian Australia the decision had been made without the input of Barkindji people, the majority native title holders. The Barkindji people hold native title claim to 80% of the land where the remains are set to be reburied. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Young, a Barkindji man and former member of the Willandra AAG, said: “We have not even been included in the process. This is the arrogance of both the federal and the state government.” “We feel really traumatised by this,” he said. “We have always canvassed the idea of a keeping place … to hold it over for the future generations.” Ley denied suggestions that the concerns of traditional owners had been ignored. “Everyone was listened to, everyone was heard,” she said. “Barkindji are represented as one of the three tribal groups on the AAG.” The group also includes Mutthi Mutthi and Ngiyampaa representatives.

4/6/2022,"The Covid-19 outbreak in Shanghai remains “extremely grim” with the ongoing lockdown of China’s financial powerhouse threatening to devastate the country’s economy and cause major disruption to already very stretched global supply chains. As Shanghai announced another daily record high of 16,766 cases on Wednesday, the director of the city’s working group on epidemic control was quoted by state media as saying that the outbreak in the city was “still running at a high level”. “The situation is extremely grim,” Gu Honghui said. Although low by international standards, this is China’s worst outbreak since the virus took hold in Wuhan in January 2020 sparking the global pandemic. Shanghai’s entire population of 26 million is now locked down and there is growing discontent among people who have been living with restrictions on their movements for weeks as the authorities stick doggedly to their zero-Covid policy of eliminating the disease. At least 38,000 medical personnel have been deployed to Shanghai from other parts of China, along with 2,000 military personnel, and the city is mass-testing residents. A separate outbreak continues to rage in the north-eastern province of Jilin and the capital, Beijing, also saw an additional nine cases. Workers shut down an entire shopping centre in the city where a case had been detected. There are increasing signs that China’s economy is slowing sharply because of the lockdowns. Activity in China’s services sector contracted at the steepest pace in two years in March as the surge in cases restricted mobility and weighed on demand. The closely watched Caixin purchasing managers’ index (PMI) dived to 42.0 in March from 50.2 in February. A drop below the 50-point mark separates growth from contraction. The same survey showed a contraction in the country’s giant manufacturing sector last week and economists warned on Wednesday that there could be worse to come as the Shanghai lockdown begins to affect the figures for the coming months. Alex Holmes of Capital Economics said spill overs to the rest of Asia from the Covid outbreak in China have been relatively minor so far but “the possibility of major disruption to supply chains remains a large and growing risk”. “The longer the current wave lasts, the greater the chance,” he said. “An added risk factor is that after many months of disruption along their entire length, global supply chains are already very stretched. There is now a much greater potential for a small bottleneck to have large repercussions.” Two years of disruption from the pandemic has dislocated the global economy’s complex supply chains, causing a sharp rise in the prices of commodities, food and consumer goods. The war in Ukraine has added to inflation, especially in oil and grain prices, and further shutdowns in China could worsen the situation. Supply-side strains in the Asia-Pacific region will remain elevated at least through the end of the year, with energy and raw material cost inflation posing the biggest cost pressures for corporate debt issuers, followed by the effects of transportation bottlenecks, according to a new report by Moody’s Investors Service. “The Russia-Ukraine crisis and continued pandemic-led disruption will hold back supply-side recovery, despite initial signs of a gradual pickup in Asia Pacific,” said Lillian Li, senior credit officer at Moodys credit rating agency. “All corporate sectors in the region will be exposed to cost risks from supply-side pressures to varying degrees through at least the end of this year. It comes amid a warning from a leading central bank chief that the world economy may be on the brink of a new inflationary era where consumers will be faced with persistently higher prices and rising interest rates due to the retreat of globalisation. Agustín Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements, said higher rates could be required for several years to combat inflation which is 6.2% in the UK.

4/6/2022,"New South Wales needs to introduce a portable entitlement scheme and establish a tribunal to deal with pay and conditions for gig economy workers, or risk falling behind other states in protecting ride share and delivery drivers, a parliamentary inquiry has found. In a report handed down on Wednesday morning, the future of work inquiry found the state needed to commit to greater protections for gig economy workers because the failure to provide them with a minimum wage, paid leave and other basic entitlements was increasing inequality across the state. “The cyclist who delivers our Friday night takeaway receives next to none of the conditions long considered fair and decent across Australia,” the report said. “The job itself also puts workers in very real danger of injury, abuse and harassment. “Late 2020 was marked by the deaths of no less than five food delivery riders, all while this inquiry was underway. These deaths, and the high potential for further tragedy, underscore the need for immediate action by the NSW government.” The inquiry, established in 2020, heard evidence of a power imbalance between the sole contractors and the multinational corporations they work for. A Transport Workers’ Union survey of riders found one-third had reported being seriously injured at work, with 66% reporting they had been subject to harassment or abuse while working. The widow of Hungry Panda rider Xiaojun Chen, one of the five food delivery riders killed during the course of the inquiry, told the inquiry his death has had a huge impact on her and their children. “Until now I still cannot believe that my husband has left us forever, my eight-year-old son has lost his father and the elderly parents with grey hair have lost their son forever. I cannot imagine how we are going to carry on our lives.” While some of the companies like Uber and Deliveroo claimed their drivers can earn an average of $21 an hour, or $10-11 per delivery, much of the evidence put forward by the companies was disputed by riders and the Transport Workers’ Union. Riders told the committee that a significant disadvantage of gig economy work is the lack of basic entitlements such as minimum pay. The Deliveroo chief executive, Ed McManus, told the inquiry that riders prefer the contractor model because it allows them to work for multiple companies and choose for whom they work. McManus also told the committee while it would seem fair for someone who frequently delivers for Deliveroo to be entitled to sick leave if they became ill, he was concerned the provision of sick leave would then form part of the work-status test to determine if the worker was an employee or independent contractor. The Uber Eats managing director, Mathew Denman, told the inquiry any entitlement provisions would need to take into account delivery riders working across multiple platforms. Inquiry chair and opposition gig economy spokesperson Daniel Mookhey said the law needed to catch up with modern practices. “A gig worker in NSW is more likely to earn less than the minimum wage, get injured at work and then go without compensation than someone doing the exact same job in places like New York and London,” Moohkey said. “The state government needs to act. NSW can establish minimum rights and conditions, binding work health and safety laws and a workers’ compensations system for gig workers. “If the NSW government continues outsource its responsibilities to Canberra, then nothing will change. Gig workers will remain at the mercy of giant tech platforms that have a monopoly on market power.” The TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, welcomed the report and urged the government to act on the recommendations to protect workers and modernise the state’s industrial system. “A tribunal with strong powers to set enforceable standards would help end the insecure work crisis undercutting secure jobs by setting gig workers up with fair rates of pay and conditions regardless of their classification,” Kaine said. “It’s time to end the carnage: the NSW government must adopt this clear roadmap to end the bloodbath on our roads”. In April last year, Menulog announced a trial to convert its Sydney CBD delivery rider contractors into employees with the associated entitlements.
