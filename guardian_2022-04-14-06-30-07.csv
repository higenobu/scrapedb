4/14/2022,"Benfica salvaged pride at Anfield but Liverpool preserved their dreams of a seventh European crown and unprecedented quadruple. Jürgen Klopp’s side advanced into the Champions League semi-finals, where they will meet Villarreal, on a fluctuating night when VAR had a hand in all three Benfica goals and Liverpool were made to fight to the finish. Ibrahima Konaté and a brace from Roberto Firmino put Liverpool on a comfortable course for the last four before VAR intervened in the form of two late Benfica goals. They were ultimately no more than consolations. A 12th European Cup/Champions League semi-final awaits Liverpool, who have equalled Manchester United’s record for an English club, and they remain in sight of a third Champions League final appearance in five seasons under Klopp. On the two previous occasions Liverpool defeated Benfica in the quarter-finals – in 1978 and 1984 – they went on to lift the trophy. Klopp made an eyebrow-raising seven changes from the team that started Sunday’s draw at Manchester City, defending his selection on the basis Liverpool needed the “freshest legs” to reach the semi-finals. Their schedule necessitates rotation, with City looming again in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday, but there was no doubt the team sheet will have raised Benfica’s hopes before kick-off. They appeared slender hopes, in truth, following last week’s 3-1 defeat in Lisbon. This was Liverpool’s 200th European game at Anfield. Only seven of the previous 199 had ended in a loss of two goals or more. There was a minute’s silence before the game in memory of the 97 Liverpool fans who were unlawfully killed at Hillsborough 33 years ago tomorrowthis Friday. It would be nice to report that it was impeccably observed but a few moronic individuals in the Benfica section, ignoring the “shushes” that came from the majority around them, decided otherwise. A much-changed team caused no immediate disruption to Liverpool’s dominance of possession or control of the tie. With Mohamed Salah rested on the bench for the first time in a Champions League game this season Klopp tasked Luis Díaz with troubling Benfica from the right. The former Porto winger again impressed against his old rivals, with his pace, touch and movement a constant thorn in the visitors’ defence. A threaded ball through midfield from Jordan Henderson enabled Díaz to exchanges passes with Firmino before darting to the by-line and crossing dangerously across the Benfica goalmouth. Goalkeeper Odisseas Vlachodimos, injured moments earlier when saving bravely at the feet of Diogo Jota, fumbled under pressure from James Milner but recovered just in time to claw the loose ball away from Firmino. Liverpool remained on the attack and opened the scoring with almost a replica of their first goal at Estádio da Luz. Kostas Tsimikas, starting in place of Andy Robertson, swung a corner deep into the Benfica penalty area where Konaté rose above a statuesque Jan Vertonghen and Nicolas Otamendi to head inside Vlachodimos’ left hand corner. Konaté had opened his Liverpool account in similar style eight days ago. Lessons had not been learned in the Benfica defence. There were warning signs for Liverpool, however. Everton curled a shot just wide of Alisson’s top corner in the opening minutes and Darwin Núñez thought he had quickly cancelled out Konaté’s header with an exquisite chip over the Liverpool goalkeeper. The powerful centre-forward was offside when racing through on to Everton’s pass, however. Díaz drew a fine save from Vlachodimos and teed up Firmino for a header that was deflected over by Vertonghen when another Tsimikas corner spread uncertainty in the Benfica area. The Portuguese side were growing more confident on the ball, however, encouraged by some loose Liverpool play, and levelled on the night when Goncalo Ramos beat Alisson with a convincing finish as he sprinted clear on goal. Liverpool looked to VAR to save them with an offside call against Ramos but Milner, while challenging Diogo Goncalves in central midfield, had inadvertently played the goalscorer through. Liverpool should have restored their lead before the interval when a defensive error by Benfica allowed Firmino to bear down on goal with Díaz unmarked to his right. Firmino delayed his pass and gave left back Alejandro Grimaldo time to take the ball off Díaz’s toes with a fine recovery. The Colombia international was evidently aggrieved. But the Brazilian would make amends with two goals in quick succession early in the second half. His first was a shambles from a Portuguese perspective. Naby Keïta instigated the move with a piercing pass into the Benfica area towards Díaz. Vlachodimos got there first but the goalkeeper, impressive in the first leg, fumbled once again and forced Vertonghen into a desperate clearance that he sliced to the unmarked Jota. The Liverpool striker scuffed his shot across goal but Firmino was on hand to convert into an empty net. Onside too, confirmed VAR. Firmino’s second, Liverpool’s third, was a controlled volley at the back post from a Tsimikas free-kick that sailed over the Benfica defence. But there would be no repeat of the first leg scoreline. Benfica substitute Roman Yaremchuk was initially flagged offside when he raced on to Julian Weigl’s pass, rounded Alisson and rolled into an unguarded net. VAR spotted he had been played onside by Gomez and Benfica’s second stood. Remarkably, a third followed via an identical source. Darwin Núñez’s cool finish was also disallowed for offside only to be overturned by VAR. Núñez then forced a fine save from Alisson as Benfica went in search of an unlikely winner.",Sport/Football,Liverpool to face Villarreal in semi-final after thrilling draw with Benfica,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/13/liverpool-benfica-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report
4/14/2022,"The title of Gazza (BBC Two) makes it clear where the focus of this two-part documentary will land. This isn’t about Paul Gascoigne the player, once “Britain’s brightest footballing hope”, though it touches on his moments of greatness and loosely tracks his sporting career. In the early minutes, it flickers between footage of Gascoigne scoring goals and the rapid churn of a tabloid printing press. This is a story about Gazza, the public figure, the clown, the character, the villain and more than that, the tabloids, the late 80s/early 90s rivalry between the Mirror and the Sun, and how Gascoigne’s life collapsed underneath it all. Often, he comes across as collateral damage. The choice to use interviewees in voiceover is classy and unobtrusive, though there is some irony in the fact that a film that purports to tell Gascoigne’s life story still falls under the shadow of the tabloids, and the dark arts that went on in order to keep him on the front pages. The second episode, which is already on iPlayer but airs next week, is much more about the media, and the familiar names – Piers Morgan, Rebekah Brooks (then Wade) – who kept the grim machine turning. The truth is that Gazza sold newspapers, in their millions. He was playing for the Newcastle United first team at 17, and by the time he was 20, he had joined Spurs, becoming the richest young footballer in the country. He was a man of the people, one of the lads, a working-class boy living the dream. You can practically see the vampires emerging in real time, and the construction of the story that would eventually play out happens in plain sight. Even in those early days, Gascoigne was asked in interviews how he was going to stay on the rails, before there was any real evidence that he might be veering off them. At the height of “Gazzamania”, after Italia 90 and those infamous teary eyes, Terry Wogan sagely warns him that all the adoration “could turn out to be a nightmare”, that they will try to knock him off his pedestal. That assessment did not begin to scratch the surface. The first episode, in particular, is an empathic look at class and family, and the trauma that Gascoigne suffered as a child. His issues – with food, with drink, with nightmares and tics, his rash streak, his violence – were known to those around him, but his friends and fellow players note that men just didn’t talk about that kind of thing back then. One of the kindest voices comes from the former glamour model Linda Lusardi, herself a tabloid fixture during the same era, who became a friend to Gascoigne, because she was rich and famous herself, and so didn’t want anything from him. As a basis for friendship, it is bleak, but her loyalty is obvious. For a time, the national love for Gascoigne was momentous. The Sun signed him up, “buying him body and soul”. Cilla Black called him a “gentle little teddybear”. He was BBC Sports Personality of the Year. But even when he was lauded as a national treasure, he talked about reporters befriending him and then “slaughtering” him in print, about being set up and set upon in nightclubs, just for the photo opportunities. The late Greg Miskiw, who was working for the News of the World at the time and was convicted of phone-hacking in 2014, talks about being “ahead of the curve”, befriending Gascoigne’s friends by finding out where they drank, before luring them into selling stories about him. “The press were very much off the leash at that time,” says Jane Nottage, who was Gascoigne’s PA until he sacked her, at which point she wrote a book about him that was serialised in the Mirror. The story gets more gruesome, and more sad. It doesn’t shy away from the domestic violence in his relationship with his girlfriend, then wife, Sheryl. After the papers report that he head-butted Sheryl following their wedding, he appears at a press conference, to talk about counselling, to rehabilitate his image. He can’t help but crack jokes about his drinking. The room laughs loudly. The film is careful to take in as many sides as possible. We hear from his mother, his sister, his former teammates, his friends and from many of the journalists who feasted on the drama. It is honest, though, much like many other documentaries of this ilk, which revisit and attempt to revise our understanding of the recent past, it does seem as if it is both condemning the tabloid press and using it at the same time. Still, as a story, this is as compelling as it is tragic. “People say they’d love to be in my position,” Gascoigne says, in one of the very many TV interviews he gave in the 1990s. “Believe me, a lot of youse wouldn’t.”",Arts/Television & radio,"Gazza review – classy, unobtrusive and gruesome",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/13/gazza-review-classy-unobtrusive-and-gruesome
4/14/2022,"“Please don’t tell anyone what happened today lads x,” one of a group of traders dubbed “the Essex Boys” texted his colleagues as they reportedly made $700m on the collapse of the oil price in 2020. The text and others were unsealed in a Chicago court on Tuesday as a US judge gave the green light to a proposed class-action lawsuit filed against the traders. Twelve traders with Essex-based Vega Capital London have been accused of manipulating markets and violating antitrust laws by the US coin, metals and jewelry dealer Mish International Monetary. The defendants had moved to have the suit thrown out, arguing they were simply following what their lawyer has called “blaring” market signals. “The content of their communications, along with the high degree of correlative trading among most of them, give rise to a highly plausible inference of an agreement among them,” US district judge Gary Feinerman wrote in his order, which included excerpts of messages between the traders. He gave the go-ahead for the case to proceed against eight of the traders. On 20 April 2020 oil prices dropped below zero for the first and, so far, only time after the coronavirus brought much of the world to a halt and triggered an oversupply of oil. Messages on the traders’ WhatsApp group, which was titled “Legends XXX”, showed the traders trying to push prices for WTI crude oil futures – an actively traded oil commodity – lower and exchanging information about their positions, according to the court filing. “We pushed each other so hard for years for this one moment … And we fucking blitzed it boys,” read one message. “Just keep selling it every 5 points,” another said. “You’ve just got to keep selling,” said another. “Everyone is going to be short and have ammo,” read another. “Fucking mental. I wanna see negative WTI prices,” read another. Mish has accused the traders of acting in “virtual lockstep” to sell oil contracts in an attempt to depress oil prices. Between 96.2% and 99.7% of their trades were highly correlated, according to the suit, and moved “in the same direction at the very same time”. In the 30 minutes between 1 and 1.30pm, when the market closed, the traders were allegedly responsible for 29.2% of the total volume in WTI crude oil futures. According to an investigation by Bloomberg News, the traders at Vega Capital mostly lived and worked out of their homes in the same neighborhood in Essex and were brought together by an experienced trader named Paul Commins, known as “Cuddles”. Lawyers for the Vega traders were not immediately available for comment.",News/Business,‘Essex Boys’ case of traders accused of manipulating markets heads for trial,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/13/essex-boys-oil-price-manipulation-trial
4/14/2022,"Donald Trump’s last White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, has been removed from the electoral roll in North Carolina, amid a criminal inquiry into whether he committed election fraud by registering to vote at a residence he never owned or lived in. Melanie Thibault, director of the Macon county board of elections, confirmed her decision to the Asheville Citizen Times, which reported that the registration for Meadows’s wife, Debra, remained active. Before working for Trump, Meadows was a congressman from North Carolina. According to the New Yorker, which reported the story last month, Meadows registered as his address a rented mobile home, in Scaly Mountain, which he reportedly had never visited. He voted from there as an absentee in the 2020 presidential election. He has subsequently registered to vote in Virginia. According to neighbors in Scaly Mountain and the former owner of the property, Debra Meadows rented and stayed at the mobile home for “a few nights” but her husband was never seen there. Thibault said Meadows’s removal from the electoral roll was standard procedure under a statute that says a person who votes in another state loses their registration in North Carolina. Meadows, who with his wife owns a condo in Virginia, reportedly voted in that state in 2021, triggering the decision to remove him from the rolls. The Citizen reported that the North Carolina state bureau of investigation was continuing its inquiry into possible voter fraud by Meadows, a fierce Trump loyalist who has never commented on the story. The bureau, the newspaper said, would not comment on whether Meadows’s removal from the North Carolina roll would affect its investigation. Meadows has commented, extensively, on the dangers of voter fraud and its supposed role in Trump’s defeat in the 2020 election. He addressed the subject at length in his memoir, The Chief’s Chief, a book which caused huge controversy when it revealed that Trump tested positive then negative for Covid before his first debate against Joe Biden, results which Meadows did not disclose. “President Trump had alerted us to the strong possibility that there would be fraud connected to these mail-in ballots, and we wanted to be on the lookout for it,” Meadows wrote in the book, adding: “We wanted to approach any potential challenges with the utmost seriousness.” The Trump campaign lost the overwhelming majority of cases alleging voter fraud in court. Trump’s lie about mass voter fraud in Biden’s win also fueled the deadly attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, in an attempt to stop certification of electoral college results. In his book, Meadows called the Capitol attack “shameful” and “the regrettable actions of a small group of people”. About 800 people, however, have been charged, with offences including seditious conspiracy. Meadows also claimed “millions” of Americans had “genuine concerns” about voter fraud. Meadows’s own legal jeopardy is not confined to North Carolina. The House committee investigating the attack has referred him to the Department of Justice for a possible charge of criminal contempt of Congress.",News/US news,Mark Meadows removed from North Carolina voter roll amid fraud inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/13/mark-meadows-removed-from-north-carolina-voter-roll-amid-inquiry
4/14/2022,"My friend Maureen Lahiff, who has died aged 90 of pancreatic cancer, was a pioneering nurse leader and innovator in nurse education. Her strong Christian faith enabled her to come to terms with the death of both her sons. Maureen was born in Richmond, Surrey, younger sister of Margaret, and daughter of parents Catherine (nee Wale) and Edward Coleman. At the start of the second world war, Catherine took her daughters to live with her parents in Coventry until. After it was bombed in the blitzed, they moved to Lincolnshire. When they returned to Richmond Maureen’s school had been bombed, and she attended four different schools in a year. In her teens, Maureen felt a call to the vocation of nursing, but mass X-ray screening diagnosed her with tuberculosis – and so she began three years of treatment, rest and learning about nursing from a patient perspective and nursing journals. Then, after general training at Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge, Maureen worked principally in the south of England, though with two years from 1962 in Australia and New Zealand, and completed thoracic, midwifery, health visitor and tutor training. In 1968 she married Kerry Lahiff. Their son, Michael, born a year later, had Down’s syndrome. His brother, David, was born in 1972. Maureen led the first part-time health visitor course in the UK, at South Bank Polytechnic in London. In 1976 she went to North East Surrey College of Technology, in Epsom, where her idea about developing nurses for advanced clinical practice resulted in the first degree course for qualified nurses in the UK, strengthening the many clinical nurse specialist posts being created at the time. Her career flourished. She undertook a master’s degree at the University of Surrey, and in 1990 was appointed professor of nursing at Hatfield Polytechnic (now Hertford University), nurse leader in Bloomsbury, central London, and nurse adviser at the Royal College of Nursing. When she was chief nurse for Bloomsbury Health Authority, and on a study tour to America in 1986 she saw how executive nurses had real power, status and authority. On her return, she and her colleague Sheila Roy, then chief nurse for North West London Health Authority, in 1988 set up the UK Executive Nurse Network, which continues to be a powerhouse for those in top nursing posts. David’s death at 20 from an epileptic seizure devastated Maureen and Kerry, triggering the development of research into Sudden Unexplained Death from Epilepsy (SUDEP) and the establishment of SUDEP Action, an education and support organisation, of which Maureen was a trustee for many years. Michael’s sudden death at 39 was another sorrowful blow. Maureen wrote Michael: A Transforming Presence, in which she described her struggle in accepting Michael’s condition, ethical issues involved in antenatal diagnosis of chromosomal anomalies and Michael’s extraordinary effect on those around him. The response to the book, published last year, was a great source of affirmation to her. Maureen coped with Kerry’s dementia and death in 2018 and her final illness with dignity and acceptance. She found many positives, including the change from a “healthy” diet to a low-fibre one, with lashings of cream with everything and plenty of chocolate – especially mint flavour. She is survived by a niece, Debbie, and nephew, Ian.",News/Society,Maureen Lahiff obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/13/maureen-lahiff-obituary
