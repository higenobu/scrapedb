3/5/2022,"Igor Sechin knows better than most that the course of true love never did run smooth. Amore Vero, a yacht linked to the head of the state oil company Rosneft, once bore the name St Princess Olga, apparently in honour of Olga Rozhkova, his second wife. After the couple split, around 2017, according to independent Russian media, the boat was renamed. Sechin, a close ally of Vladimir Putin who has been described as the second most important person in Russia, never publicly claimed ownership of the Amore Vero. However, a reporter at Moscow-based Novaya Gazeta traced a series of pictures on Rozhkova’s Instagram that matched the 86-metre vessel and its movements through the world’s most glamorous ports. The boat accommodates up to 14 guests in eight staterooms, plus a private owner’s deck and a swimming pool that turns into a helipad. Sechin was sanctioned by the EU on Monday, but he has not been blacklisted by the UK. Now the French government has confirmed it thinks he is the main shareholder of the offshore company that owned the Amore Vero. It was seized this week by customs in a night-time raid on a dockyard near Marseille. The $120m ($90m) Amore Vero and others like it have become symbols of a crackdown on the super-wealthy elite around Putin after the invasion of Ukraine prompted a wave of sanctions as the US, EU and UK try to isolate Russia’s economy. As chief executive of Rosneft, Sechin commands a central place in that economy. The oil it supplies to the world is one of Putin’s key geopolitical tools, and taxes on the company brought in 1.8tn roubles for the Russian government in 2020 alone. That cash would have been enough to fund about 40% of the annual military budget. Perhaps more than anyone else, Sechin is representative of the mixing of political and financial power that has characterised Russia since the chaotic collapse of the Soviet Union. He has prospered under a regime that has seen huge private fortunes built from publicly owned assets. “He is one of Vladimir Putin’s most trusted and closest advisors, as well as his personal friend,” the EU sanctions notice alleges. “He has been in contact with the Russian president on a daily basis.” Rosneft did not respond to requests for comment, but before the invasion a spokesperson said the company was “a commercial organisation” that had no “political agenda”. A yacht management company associated with the Amore Vero denied on Thursday that Sechin owned it. “I can absolutely say that Igor Sechin is not the owner,” a spokesperson for Imperial Yachts, which manages the vessel, told CNN. Sechin, 61, has revealed relatively little about his early life, but he studied French and Portuguese at Leningrad University in what is now St Petersburg. He then served in the army in Angola and Mozambique as a translator, according to Russian media. However, he is widely seen as a key member of Russia’s “siloviki”, the former members of the Russian security services who are thought to wield significant power in the country. He has ridden on Putin’s coattails to Russia’s upper echelons. In the 1990s he worked in Putin’s office when the latter was mayor of St Petersburg, and in 1999 became deputy head of Putin’s administration. Sechin was first appointed to the Rosneft board in 2004, shortly before it absorbed the assets previously controlled by the billionaire owner Mikhail Khodorkovsky – now an exile after serving 10 years in prison following the dismantling of his company, Yukos. While Sechin served a four-year term as deputy prime minister from 2008, it was his arguably his appointment as Rosneft chief in 2012 that marked his key position in Putin’s regime. Under his eye the company struck deals with Italy’s Eni, Norway’s Statoil (now Equinor), China’s CNPC and America’s ExxonMobil – then led by Rex Tillerson, later hired as US secretary of state by Donald Trump. The EU claimed Sechin has been “rewarded” by Putin with “great wealth” to outdo even his Rosneft pay, reported at as much as $11.8m in 2015. (Sechin’s pay was not disclosed in the latest annual report.) Rosneft returns the favours. The EU said the oil company financed the vineyards of a palace complex used personally by Putin near the Black Sea resort town of Gelendzhik.",News/Business,Igor Sechin: the epitome of power in Putin’s Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/04/igor-sechin-the-epitome-of-power-in-putin-russia-rosneft-economy
3/5/2022,"The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, built between 1984 and 1995, is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and the ninth largest in the world. It has six reactors, each generating 950MW, and a total output of 5,700MW, enough energy for roughly 4m homes. In normal times it produces one-fifth of Ukraine’s electricity and almost half the energy generated by the country’s nuclear power facilities. The plant is located in south-east Ukraine in Enerhodar on the banks of the Kakhovka reservoir on the Dnieper river. It is about 200km from the contested Donbas region and 550km south-east of Kyiv. A fire broke out in a training building outside the plant in the early hours of Friday, after being shelled by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said. The first report came from an employee at the plant, who posted on Telegram that Russian forces had fired on the facility and there was “a real threat of nuclear danger at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe”. Ukraine’s foreign minister confirmed the reports at 2.30am, tweeting that the Russian army was “firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Fire has already broke out.” He called for an immediate ceasefire to allow firefighters to control the blaze. A short time later, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service reported that radiation at the plant was “within normal limits” and the fire conditions at the plant were “normal”. It reported that the fire was in a building outside the power plant. They later reported that the third power unit at the plant was disconnected at 2.26am, leaving just one of the plant’s six units, unit four, still operating. Early reports of the incident at the power plant sent financial markets in Asia spiralling, with stocks tumbling and oil prices surging further. Ukrainian authorities on Friday morning said the facility was secured and “nuclear safety is now guaranteed”. Earlier, the International Atomic Energy Agency said the Ukraine regulator told the agency that there was “no change reported in radiation levels at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant site”. The US also said their latest information showed no indication of elevated radiation levels at the plant. The US energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, said the reactors “are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down”. Russia has already captured the defunct Chernobyl plant, 100km north of Kyiv. Some analysts noted the Zaporizhzhia plant is of a different and safer type to Chernobyl, which was the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986. The chances of explosion, nuclear meltdown or radioactive release are low, said Tony Irwin, an honorary associate professor at the Australian National University. Irwin, who operated nuclear power plants in the UK for three decades, is a former manager of the open-pool Australian lightwater (OPAL) reactor, Australia’s only nuclear reactor. He said the pressurised water reactors were “a lot safer” than the reactors at Chernobyl, and did not appear to be damaged yet. The reactors have large concrete containments and built-in fire protection systems, he said, adding: “Obviously, it’s not a good idea if you start shooting massive missiles at reactors,” he said. “The PWR type is a much safer sort of reactor, because it’s a two-circuit design reactor. The water that keeps the reactor cool is on a separate circuit to the second one, which actually supplies the power to the turbine and the outside.” “These reactors have back-up emergency cooling systems as well. In addition to the normal reactor cooling, they’ve got a passive system, they’ve got high-pressure injection systems, they’ve got low-pressure injection systems.”  This article was amended on 4 March 2022. Tony Irwin was referring to the concrete containments, not “contaminants” of the PWR reactors.",News/World news,Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant: everything you need to know,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-everything-you-need-to-know
3/5/2022,"The UK government is planning emergency powers to immediately sanction people who have already been sanctioned by the US or EU, in response to a barrage of criticism that it has been too slow to target Russian oligarchs. Amendments to sanctions laws tabled by Priti Patel, the home secretary, would introduce a new “urgent procedure” to give the UK the legal ability to sanction individuals on the basis of other countries while it builds up its own cases. Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, prompting a wave of financial sanctions from the EU and the US. However, on Friday the UK had only imposed sanctions on 15 individuals and 205 companies. The urgent designation will be limited to 56 days, according to the amendment, seen by the Guardian. That would mean that Foreign Office officials would still have to build up a legal case for the sanctions to the same standards. However, it could allow UK officials to move more quickly to follow allies. Officials in EU member states have expressed frustrations about the UK’s slow pace. On Thursday, Frans Timmermans, the European Commission’s first vice-president said the UK would “continue to follow the [EU’s] lead because the pressure of the public opinion in the UK is very clear about this”. The changes are being brought as part of amendments to a long-delayed economic crime bill that has been spurred by the invasion. They are aimed at “streamlining the process by which an appropriate minister can make designations for the purposes of sanctions regulations”, according to an attached explanatory statement. The amendment says that the minister can rely on “corresponding” provisions brought under laws in the USA, the EU, Australia and Canada, as well as any other country specified by ministers. Dame Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP who has long campaigned for tougher anti-corruption laws, said the amendments appeared to be “a win for parliament” that would give the power to sanction Russian oligarchs more quickly. “The government is seeing sense and putting in place the emergency legislation that we have been calling for to ensure that we can quickly sanction the Russian oligarchs propping up Putin’s regime,” she said. “For too long the UK has been the jurisdiction of choice for dirty money. And now we are a global laughing stock as we have lagged behind our allies with our utter failure to effectively sanction Putin’s oligarch cronies.” Tom Keatinge, a financial crime expert at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank (RUSI), said the changes may reflect a realisation in government that it has been unable to act quickly enough during the crisis. “Clearly the UK’s frustration with its ability to enact its own laws means it is going to have to rely on the designations of other countries,” he said. Other amendments include reducing an implementation period for foreign owners to declare their beneficial ownership of UK property from 18 months to six months – as called for by Hodge and other MPs – as well as raising minimum daily fines for failing to disclose information required under the economic crime bill from £500 to £2,500. Hodge said: “Tougher financial penalties and a six-month implementation period will make the new property register more effective in shining a light on any crook or kleptocrat that wishes to use our property market to hide their ill-gotten gains.”",News/Politics,UK to speed up sanctions on Russian oligarchs by copying allies’ decisions,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/04/uk-to-speed-up-sanctions-on-russian-oligarchs-by-copying-allies-decisions
3/5/2022,"Shane Warne, who has died aged 52 of a suspected heart attack, was almost certainly the greatest spin bowler cricket has ever produced. More than that, he was one of the most outsize personalities of any sport. Everything he did in his game and his life was on a grand scale: he lived fast and, it transpires, died young. Warne singlehandedly revived the discipline of leg-spin, which by the time he burst into Test cricket in the 1990s was almost a lost art. He arrived into an Australia team that had already embarked on a run of eight Ashes series wins and made it overwhelmingly stronger – he was still in the business of terrorising Englishmen when he retired from Test cricket 14 years later. Spin bowlers in his era, certainly English ones, often found themselves apologetic figures brought on to give a little breather to the fast men, who had begun to dominate the sport, certainly outside Asia. Warne was the reverse: he was not just a master of his craft; he commanded the arena. He made that clear from the first ball he bowled in an Ashes Test, to Mike Gatting at Old Trafford: “Two-thirds of the way down the pitch the ball dipped into the leg-side, opening Gatting up like a can of beans, before ripping diagonally across his body to clip the outside of off-stump,” wrote Mike Selvey in the Guardian. “Gatting stood his ground, not in dissent or disappointment but in total, utter disbelief.” At the time some called it the Ball from Hell. As time went by it was sanctified as the Ball of the Century. Warne was born and brought up in the Melbourne suburbs, the son of Bridgette, who had come to Australia aged three, and Keith. He was not remotely academic but at 15 he won a sports scholarship to Mentone grammar school which, he concluded, licensed him not to be academic at all. Cricket was not his obvious sport; at first, Australian Rules, tennis and swimming might have been ahead of it. Yet his special brilliance at cricket was connected with the attributes needed for those three; he had extraordinary upper-body strength: shoulders, arms and wrists. Warne himself thought this might be connected with him breaking both legs when he was eight and having to wheel himself round in a cart. Plus he had a natural gift at spinning a cricket ball. At first he was seen as a batsman who bowled a bit. But as he moved through the ranks at one of Melbourne’s top-grade clubs, St Kilda, bowling took over. Warne was always an Australian archetype – the lovable larrikin who disobeys the rules but triumphs. He irritated teammates with his flash cars (from teenage days) and dyed blond hair. He irritated by-the-book coaches, notably at the Australian cricket academy, with his disdain for their idea of fitness and discipline. But he proved himself cricket-fit and was plunged into the Australia team against India in January 1992, although he did nothing in that match and was dropped. The following winter he bowled Australia to a stunning victory over West Indies when he turned 143 for one to 219 all out. Then in New Zealand he took 17 wickets in three Tests, and Martin Crowe, the opposing captain, called him the best leg-spinner in the world. When he came to England with Australia that spring, Warne worked away early in the tour at Worcester while Graeme Hick hit him everywhere except into the river and the cathedral. Overhyped, it was said. With hindsight, that day must be seen as part of the masterplan. There were no unbelievers after the Gatting ball. Unlike the previous leg-spin standard-bearer, the Pakistani player Abdul Qadir, Warne did not use the googly as his major weapon. He quickly became a master of the flipper, which also turned the presumed wrong way, but with the help of backspin. He mastered many other variants, some of which may have existed only in opponents’ heads. “If the batsman thinks it’s spinning,” as one old-timer put it, “it’s spinning.” He was also a master of performance art, facial expressions, unexpected stops and starts, never letting the batsman settle. And, when all else failed, good old Australian sledging. The wickets and landmarks kept coming, but so did the scrapes. It was belatedly revealed that he had been involved in the first manifestation of cricket’s problems with match-fixing when he had taken money for giving information about pitches and weather to a Sri Lankan bookmaker. It was at the bottom end of the scale of potential illegality but caused great reputational damage at the time. More scrapes followed, above all the use of a banned diuretic, for which he was banished for a year and which he rather ungallantly appeared to blame on his mother. Thus Warne never did become Australia captain, at which he might well have excelled. But his Test career ended in a blaze of glory when Australia avenged England’s nation-stopping theatrical Ashes victory of 2005 by crushing England 5-0. In his 144th and penultimate Test, he took his 700th Test wicket. Warne also broke the mould by proving spin bowlers could succeed in one-day cricket. He captained Rajasthan Royals to the first Indian Premier League title in 2008 and proved an effective and popular captain and coach in England with Hampshire. He enjoyed his celebrity and all that it brought him. There was a brief, highly publicised relationship with Liz Hurley. He remained a handsome, charismatic, fun-loving figure who did not slow down. Behind it all, he was charming and at heart a true son of the game. He was named one of the five cricketers of the 20th century by Wisden in 2000 and was both gracious and chuffed to bits. Everyone in cricket will be devastated that the carnival is over. He is survived by three children, Jackson, Summer and Brooke, from his 1995 marriage to Simone Callahan, which ended in divorce in 2005.

3/5/2022,"The National Crime Agency has obtained freezing orders against bank accounts held by a British businessman containing money it believes is linked to the billionaire Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. The agency said on Friday that it has secured two account freezing orders in respect of five bank accounts held by Graham Bonham-Carter. A spokesperson said: “The orders were obtained on the basis that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the money in the accounts was derived from the laundering of funds of an individual subject to sanctions in the United States, namely Oleg Deripaska. The accounts contain funds of a value totalling approximately £110,000. This is an ongoing investigation and we are not commenting further at this time.” In 2018, the US treasury imposed sanctions on Deripaska in response to Russian activity including instigation of violence in eastern Ukraine, cyber-attacks and attempts to interfere in western elections. It said Deripaska had acted “on behalf of … a senior Russian government official” – code for president Vladimir Putin – and had claimed to represent the Kremlin in other countries. It added: “Deripaska has been investigated for money laundering, and has been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and racketeering.” The oligarch, whose wealth is currently estimated at $3bn, according to Forbes magazine, denies the allegations and is taking legal action to challenge them. Deripaska has made no secret of his support for Putin, previously declaring he has no interest separate from those of the Russian state and travelling on a Russian diplomatic passport. But he was one of the first leading Russian businessmen to speak out against the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, amid efforts by the international community to make Russia pay an economic price for the assault. The Times reported that Westminster magistrates court was told on Friday that Bonham Carter, the cousin of actor Helena Bonham Carter, was linked to five properties in the US and the UK, of which Deripaska was the ultimate beneficial owner. Among properties linked to Deripaska are Hamstone House, a Grade II listed five bedroom property in Surrey, built in 1937, with a basement and 8 acres of grounds. In 2020, it was advertised for sale for £16m, according to Tatler. Others are a Washington Mansion and a three-story townhouse, on Gay Street, in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village neighbourhood, valued at $14.7m. The Times said that the NCA told the court the US houses were owned by Gracetown Inc, a company of which Bonham-Carter is listed as CEO.",News/World news, UK businessman’s accounts frozen over links to Oleg Deripaska,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/uk-businessman-graham-bonham-carter-accounts-frozen-over-links-oleg-deripaska
3/5/2022,"Russian ground forces began their long expected move to push west towards the key port of Odesa in the south of Ukraine with an assault of the shipbuilding centre of Mykolaiv, as the area around the capital Kyiv came under fresh heavy attack. Mykolaiv, where Ukrainian officials say they repelled a Russian attack, is seen as the next key stepping stone for Russian forces on the road to Odesa, which came under naval shell fire on Friday, after taking the key southern city of Kherson earlier this week. The latest fighting came as local authorities in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv raised the death toll from an airstrike that hit streets and residential buildings to forty-seven people. “On 3 March, 47 people were killed by a Russian airstrike on a residential area in Chernihiv,” local authorities said on Facebook. As battles involving airstrikes and artillery continued on Friday across the country, including northwest of the capital Kyiv and the north-eastern cities of Kharkiv and Okhtyrka. Loud explosions could be heard in Kyiv throughout Friday, where thick plumes of black smoke towered over the capital’s northwestern outskirts. A Russian airstrike on a rural residential about 6 miles from Kyiv ‘s outskirts killed at least seven people on Friday, including two children. “I don’t know what the tanks are doing because they can’t cross the river into Kyiv,” local security guard Vasyl Prikhodko said. “They are shooting at things. Then they are rolling back. Maybe they are just trying to scare us,” the 47-year-old said. On Friday, church bells and air raid sirens rang out across the deserted central streets of Kyiv, with the only signs of life queues outside pharmacies. The city continues to empty out as more and more people flee before the Russian assault intensifies. With shocking images on television from Kharkiv, Mariupol and Chernihiv, Kyiv residents have decided not to wait for the same carnage to come to them. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, claimed this week that Ukrainian officials have foiled three assassination plots against president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had been foiled by Ukrainian forces. However, Yevgeny Ptashnik, commander of the territorial defence unit guarding the government quarter in central Kyiv, said he doubted the plots were real. “For Putin it’s very important to take our president alive,” he claimed, citing Putin’s shock at the execution of Muammar Gaddafi. He commended Zelenskiy’s bravery for staying in central Kyiv rather than fleeing to a bunker somewhere in the west of the country. “This is the difference between us and others. We don’t hide, we stay strong until the end,” he said. As the war has taken an ever more horrific turn almost by the day, eyewitness reported dead lying in the streets of Volnovakha near Donetsk. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich said Ukrainian forces had prevented Russian efforts to take Mykolaiv while artillery defended Odessa from repeated attempts by Russian ships to fire on the major Black Sea port. In a sign of the mounting pressure on Ukrainian forces, not least in the south, who are under siege in cities across the country, the flagship of the country’s naval fleet – the Hetman Sahaidachny – was scuttled at the shipyard in Mykolaiv where it was undergoing repairs to prevent it from being seized by Russian forces. Another strategic port, Mariupol on the Azov Sea, was “partially under siege,” said officials with Ukrainian forces were pushing back efforts to surround the city where civilians described increasingly desperate conditions. Heavy fighting continued on the outskirts of another strategic port, Mariupol, on the Azov Sea. The battles have knocked out the city’s electricity, heat and water systems, as well as most phone service, officials said. With the conflict in Ukraine, which was triggered by Russia’s invasion last week, seeing spiralling violence amid accusations of potential Russian war crimes in their assault on Ukrainian cities. In a further sign of the widening scope of the conflict, Ukraine’s state emergency agency issued mass text messages Friday with advice on what to do in case of an explosion. Putin’s forces have brought their superior firepower to bear over the past few days, launching hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites and making significant gains in the south, including taking the port of Kherson, the first major city to fall. The Russian campaign, which has seen civilian centres threatened with devastation, has so far been most successful in the south where the Kremlin’s 2014 seizure of the Crimean Peninsula has given it logistical advantage in the country’s south. With 1.2 million people already displaced, long queues of cars were heading to the Moldova border, most from Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia. Severing Ukraine’s access to the Black and Azov seas would deal a crippling blow to its economy and allow Russia to build a land corridor to Crimea, seized by Moscow in 2014. As the war has driven ever larger numbers to flee the country, many fleeing had to walking long distances. Walking the final 14 miles to Ukraine’s border and to safety, Ludmila Sokol was moved by the mounds of clothes and other personal effects that many people discarded as they fled the fighting before her. “You should have seen things scattered along the road,” said the gym teacher from Zaporizhzhia. “Because the further you carry things, the harder it is.” Like more than 1 million others, she’s grappling with the pain of leaving everything behind.",News/World news,Russian forces push to take key port of Odesa as fighting near Kyiv rages,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-ukraine-mykolaiv-odesa-push-kyiv-fighting
3/5/2022,"They were a legit Hollywood “it” couple – two Saturday Night Live sweethearts who’d go on to produce Step Brothers, Talladega Nights and so many other ribald gems. And then out of nowhere came the bulletin that Adam McKay and Will Ferrell had called time on their creative partnership, the former unpacking the whole affair in a Vanity Fair interview in November. Even more unimaginable than McKay’s disclosure that the superstar SNL alum was no longer on speaking terms with his former SNL head writer was Ferrell turning on McKay after being denied right of first refusal for the lead in a new dramedy McKay was developing about the Showtime-era Los Angeles Lakers. Instead, McKay went with Step Brothers co-lead John C Reilly – another Ferrell bestie and frequent Funny or Die and Gary Sanchez collaborator who was reportedly put in the unenviable position of having to break the news of the booking to Ferrell. As much as it smarts to see business drive a wedge between arguably the most productive comedy team of the past two decades, there’s no question that McKay had to make that choice to give Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty a shooter’s chance. Where longtime Ferrell watchers might have had a hard time distancing this new role on court from his over-the-top portrayal of owner-coach-player Jackie Moon in the ABA send-up Semi-Pro, Reilly thoroughly embodies Jerry Buss, the late chemist turned real estate mogul who sparked the Lakers conversion from NBA also-ran to one of the world’s most prized sports franchises (with an estimated $5.5bn valuation). Reilly nails Buss’s libidinous charisma, pulls off his porn star coif, fits his swinger threads (which go a long way toward distancing Reilly from the ambitious porn star he played in Boogie Nights). Crucially, Reilly is better at keeping his audiences from cracking up when he fast-breaks from funny to serious. The problem with Winning Time isn’t the Buss part being outside of Reilly’s wheelhouse, it’s that he’s a hub with far too many spokes. Based on a book by the best-selling sports biographer Jeff Pearlman, Winning Time has a cast that’s large enough to fill three shows – one on Buss (who liquidated the Chrysler Building and a slew of other holdings to meet the Lakers’ $67.5m package price), another on the rise of Magic Johnson (the hall of famer who triggered the Showtime attack and the current era of positionless basketball) and yet another on the NBA – a second-rate sports league until Johnson and his rivalry with Boston’s Larry Bird took it mainstream. Sally Field (who shines as mother Jessie Buss) and Gillian Jacobs (who elevates the role of wife to the famed Lakers coach Pat Riley) are two stars relegated to the bench and restricted to a handful of minutes. The whole series plays like a Kanye West production, as if the point is seeing how many great performers can be minimised for texture. It’s as if McKay (and Winning Time’s lead writers Rodney Barnes and Max Borenstein by extension) didn’t pick up any story craft from working with Jesse Armstrong on Succession. That show knows how to marshal a large production: cram it in a tight space (a private jet, a kid’s room). Winning Time is all sprawl, dipping back and forth from LA when it isn’t exploring haunts like the Playboy Mansion – an even more haunting stop now in light of recent sexual abuse allegations made in a still-unfurling 10-part A&E docuseries. Really, most of the sex appeal feels cringe, the kind of stuff HBO once spattered across its shows to hook subscribers. (See Jason Clarke, as Lakers coach Jerry West, having sex with his future wife.) Sure, LA was all about free love back then. But that doesn’t mean Winning Time had to be so regressive. Rather than let Clarke’s mercurial West or Rob Morgan’s tender Earvin Johnson Sr or Solomon Hughes’s spot-on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar stand on their own, Winning Time seizes focus by emptying every McKay trick in the book: deploying superimposed all-caps to hammer home the obvious (Larry Bird is WHITE), leaning heavily on expository writing (this is sports, not The Big Short) and, ugh, breaking the fourth wall. Sadly, it seems all Winning Time takes away from Succession are the sepia tones from the Roy family home videos – and that too spreads to excess. It’s unlikely any of these flaws will be worth ignoring Winning Time. Casual viewers will gravitate to the star-studded company, hoops heads will snark at the winking prescience (Magic Johnson in the post? It’ll never work!), and the look back at glory days will comfort Lakers fans desperate for an escape from the meltdown of today’s over-the-hill Lakers. Quite besides, Winning Time seems little more than a big idea that’s better captured in a book than a limited series. Devoting multiple seasons to disparate themes, like The Wire, might have been too much to ask. But in all Winning Time is hardly anything to be broken up about.

3/5/2022,"Julian Fayad describes himself as a “regular” guy. The 29-year-old second-generation Australian with a Lebanese background runs a finance business in western Sydney, has a young family and has lived in Parramatta his entire life. Like many Australians, he had only a passing interest in politics, until the impact of Covid restrictions on his community lit a spark. “I was having grown men that I would consider to be somewhat bulletproof – strong, great business owners, really switched on – calling me up crying because they were unable to pay their rent,” Fayad tells Guardian Australia. “There was the laptop class, that I am actually part of, and then there was everybody else. “If you want to know what’s happening in Parramatta, take a walk down Church Street – every second shop has a ‘for lease’ sign on it. The restaurants and the small businesses, they still have the signage on them, but they are freshly closed and lost.” Angry at what he saw as a betrayal of his community (“the federal government screwed us, the state government screwed us”), Fayad decided to put his hand up to run for the United Australia party in the western Sydney seat of Parramatta. “This was not on my list of goals. If you had told me 18 months ago I was going to run as a candidate for the UAP, I would have laughed in your face. “I would normally have no business paying attention to this. I am a regular person, wife, two kids, young family, but the danger [the major parties] have run into is people like me are now paying attention.” There is something happening on the ground in the outer suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. It may just be a ripple, or it could be a roar – another crack in Australia’s political landscape arising from the pandemic. The full impact won’t be known until election night, but the number of people finding resonance with the “freedom” message of Clive Palmer’s United Australia party cannot be ignored. The United Australia party has attracted some controversial figures and candidates, including at least two who have espoused views in support of Vladimir Putin. But disaffected voters right across the country, particularly from the migrant communities of western Sydney and western Melbourne that were hard hit by lockdowns, are also signing up to join the Palmer movement. A mass advertising campaign – already estimated to have cost $30m – is expected to ramp up in the weeks before polling day, with expectations Palmer will outspend the estimated $83m campaign of 2019. The party claims 85,000 members and counting, but this figure has come under question as a number of people reported being signed up unwittingly. Reliable polling numbers to judge community support are hard to come by. The most recent Essential poll has support for Palmer at 3% with support highest among males in Queensland and New South Wales, similar to the results of the Resolve political monitor which is tracking UAP support at about 4%. What these numbers don’t tell you is where this vote is concentrated. An oft-cited poll from research group Redbridge found support as high as 17% in some western Sydney seats last September, with the Coalition losing most of its 2019 vote to the UAP. Party figures on both sides say the Redbridge figure is higher than internal polling suggests, with their research indicating support in the single digits. But everyone is watching closely and concedes the electorate is patchy. Craig Kelly, the defector Liberal MP and now leader of the UAP, says his observation is the party has won over strong support from first, second and third generation migrants from former eastern bloc countries, the Middle East and Vietnam. “Where they have had first hand experience themselves, or a story from a grandfather or mother about how they lived in a country that didn’t have the freedoms they have enjoyed in Australia for decades, that seems to be where we are getting the strongest support from,” Kelly tells Guardian Australia. Kelly points to the “discrimination” felt within these communities from lockdown measures, particularly in Sydney where the NSW government’s Covid response failed migrant communities, and where the divide between the city’s east and west was acutely felt. “To be told that you are not worthy to go to the eastern suburbs or the beaches but the people in the beachside suburbs can, the people of western Sydney won’t forget that,” Kelly says. Labor’s Ed Husic has also spoken of the anger in western Sydney as the city was divided in response to the Covid pandemic, pointing to the 60% of deaths that were recorded in the west and south-west of Sydney by the end of the city’s lockdowns. “The Liberals were content to draw a line through the middle of Sydney, carve it up and see how we on the other side fared,” Husic said in a speech last year. “It was a grossly uneven line at that.” Not only has western Sydney been left with economic scarring from the pandemic lockdowns, figures released from the Australian Bureau of Statistics last week showed that the Covid death rate was three times higher among migrants than those born in Australia. Redbridge has been running focus groups for the past two years with voters who plan to support the UAP at this year’s federal election. At last weekend’s session, as in most of the 200-odd groups held since 2020, the voting group was diverse, with a strong showing from Australia’s migrant communities. “We had a Maltese translator, we had a professionally educated woman in a hijab, we had a young male who clearly was of Greek background, another woman who was a third-generation migrant, we had some of your classic Aussie males, and someone from the subcontinent – it was a real mixed bag of lollies,” Redbridge director Kos Samaras tells Guardian Australia. Samaras, who worked as a campaign strategist for the Labor party from 2004 to 2019, is keen to understand not just who but why these people are motivated to vote for the UAP. More importantly, he is interested in whether these voters can be won back, and whether their vote will make any difference on election night. Drawing on community anger about the management of the pandemic, Palmer has effectively harnessed a diverse group of people who have suffered some sort of economic shock, including strident libertarians, anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists, alongside many working and middle class people. Samaras says the focus groups have detected a strong theme of status anxiety among UAP voters. He cites two flavours: those who feel threatened by their belief that their cultural power is diminishing, and those who feel threatened because of some sort of economic stress or strain. In this world of perceived threats, Palmer’s freedom narrative resonates. “For some of them it is status anxiety, so white males there they don’t like getting told by authority what to do in their lives,” Samaras says. “They’ve had it like that for two years and they’ve lost their brains. “But then there’s others who have worked in the precariat and they’ve had their entire lives turned upside down and not been able to have any income. The various forms of support that were thrown around by governments didn’t really render any support to them, so they fell through the cracks.” Samaras estimates that about two-thirds of the UAP vote is coming from the Liberal base, and one-third from former Labor voters. There is also a strong correlation between the communities where the vaccine rate is lowest and where the UAP vote is strongest. It’s tempting to dismiss Palmer as nothing more than a sideshow. In 2019, he failed to win a single House of Representatives seat, with the party securing just 3.5% of the primary vote. But Palmer claimed that he had achieved his desired result of ensuring Bill Shorten was not elected, crediting the 65% of second-preference flows he directed to the Coalition for keeping Morrison in The Lodge. While post-election analysis showed UAP preferences were decisive in just one Coalition-held seat (Bass, in Tasmania), Labor’s election review found the anti-Labor and anti-Shorten messaging was extremely damaging. This time around, Palmer’s message is different. Rather than being a wrecking ball for Labor, the party is campaigning hard against the government, Labor and the Greens. Kelly has indicated that, apart from a few possible exceptions, UAP will ask supporters to preference incumbents last. “Liberal, Labor and the Greens have sold out our country,” is the key UAP campaign message. Psephologist Kevin Bonham, who called the 2019 Palmer preference effect a “furphy”, says he doubts the 2022 UAP vote will end up being consequential on election night. “If people actually follow those recommendations strongly it will have a big impact, but the experience with minor parties is they don’t,” Bonham says. “If he does it, and there’s any kind of a kind of adherence to it at all, then that’s bad for the Coalition because he preferenced the Coalition in every seat last time. “So that may not necessarily be catastrophic, but even if you’re dropping 0.3% or 0.5% something like that, then that is still something in those really close seats,” he says. Palmer’s best chance of electoral success is more likely in the Senate, where he will be running on the Queensland ticket competing against Pauline Hanson, Campbell Newman and the LNP’s Amanda Stoker for the final Senate spot. The contest highlights the other difficulty facing the UAP: it is operating in a crowded field of independents on the right, with One Nation and the Liberal Democrats all vying for the same cohort of voters that are unhappy with vaccine mandates and lockdowns. Neither of the major parties can afford to ignore the melting pot of grievances arising from the pandemic. Labor is hoping the protest vote being captured by Palmer will ultimately lead to its victory, framing the election as a referendum on the Morrison government. Acutely aware of this threat, Scott Morrison and Barnaby Joyce have been at pains to distance themselves from state government mandates, with some LNP MPs going further to try and capture the anti-establishment mood. One senior Liberal strategist says that the best description for its position on the threat of UAP as it surveyed the electoral map was “alert not alarmed”. “When there’s that much money being spent it remains unpredictable and no one could say with any confidence exactly what’s going to happen,” they said. “Yes, there will probably be a handful of seats where they do reasonably well on the primary vote, but then go to preferences and there’s a whole lot of other issues around that … and whether that will actually be determinative in terms of the result. “But having said all that, you have got to stay alert when there’s just such a vast amount of money being spent.” A Labor figure said there was concern that Palmer could yet shift his “pox on both your houses” messaging and turn on Labor or its leader, Anthony Albanese. A recent UAP ad asking, “Why did Albo have a makeover?” raised the blood pressure, but similar ads on Joyce and Morrison soon followed. And if Palmer preferences against the Liberals? “Labor wins in a landslide,” one senior figure said. Despite suggestions UAP may not have the resources to man booths and hand out how-to-vote cards, Kelly insists that this time round the party will have more resources on the ground than the major parties in key seats. He says that in his own seat of Hughes, for example, he has 1,000 people registered as members who want to volunteer, compared with the 100 odd that he would expect from the Liberal party in Hughes. “If we can pull above 25% we are in with a chance,” Kelly says, pointing to the 26.5% Palmer polled in 2013 to successfully win the seat of Fairfax. When asked how much he expects the party to spend, Kelly says: “Whatever it takes. We are just warming up.” For Fayad, he thinks he has a “realistic” chance of winning the seat of Parramatta – held by Labor on a 3.5% margin – saying he believes the UAP is gaining support from a previously disengaged voting base, many of whom “don’t speak politics”. He thinks there is support from at least one in four voters. “Some of them are fully vaccinated and have had their booster but they had small businesses or they have lost their jobs because of mandates,” he says. “There has been enough issues that they have at least rubbed one in four people up the wrong way. “They don’t have a disdain for the government, it is a disdain for the way they were treated for the last two years. There are just so many sad stories of people losing things that they have worked so hard for.”",News/Australia news,Kelly’s heroes: can the UAP’s politics of anger derail the Australian election?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/05/kellys-heroes-can-the-uaps-politics-of-anger-derail-the-australian-election
3/5/2022,"For fans of: MGMT, Unknown Mortal Orchestra, the Sleepy Jackson After traversing the cosmos with Empire of the Sun, producing pop songs for Beyoncé and trading sequencer settings with Daniel Johns in Dreams, Luke Steele gets back to where he once belonged with Common Man. Steele’s first solo single picks up sonically where the second Sleepy Jackson record left off back in 2006. There’s smatterings of George Harrison-style slide, a gentle pastoral melody and enough backwards bits to suck you into a vortex. Mostly, it seems like Steele is revisiting the style of songwriting that commanded his Sleepy Jackson debut Lovers, with acoustic strumming, thoughtful melodic leaps and beds of wordless vocals, all making for an otherworldly sound without diving into the sci-fi that often made Empire of the Sun seem robotic and forced. For more: Steele’s debut solo album Listen to the Water is out 13 May. For fans of: the Motels, Divinyls, Cyndi Lauper For someone who showed such preternatural songwriting talent at a tender age, Missy Higgins seems most comfortable when interpreting the songs of others. In 2014, she released a covers album featuring songs from Something For Kate, Slim Dusty and Kylie Minogue, while more recently she recorded a song penned by Tim Minchin and rang in Sydney’s New Year’s Eve celebrations with a Perry Keyes cover. Here, she slays the Motels’s classic Total Control, opting for a faithful rendition rather than a reinvention (if it ain’t broke). Total Control is the title track and gateway drug to her new EP inspired by the calls for widespread change brought about by the horrific experiences and impressive strength of Grace Tame and Brittany Higgins. In this context, it casts Total Control’s yearning lyrics in a new, more urgent light. For more: Total Control EP is out now. For fans of: the Get Up Kids, Bodyjar, Tuesday Avril Lavigne is working with members of Blink-182, and walking tattoo Machine Gun Kelly has a guitar slung around his shoulders in every second promo shot. Pop-punk must be back! In truth, bands such as Brisbane’s Beddy Rays, along with the likes of Bugs and Luca Brasi, have been carrying the pop-punk torch in Australia for the new generation, while stalwarts such as Bodyjar and Frenzal Rhomb continue to sell out venues nationwide. Milk is a tour de force, boasting more hooks than Alf Stewart’s bait shop, tight chorus harmonies, and a gleeful, giddy sense of forward propulsion. “Milk is about breaking out of a rough patch, moving on and reminding yourself that sometimes you need to let go,” frontman Jacko shares. Momentum never sounded so sweet. For more: Check out recent singles On My Own, Week on Repeat, and Wait a While. For fans of: the Hummingbirds, the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Smudge “We just need to look away,” sings Kellie Lloyd on the new Screamfeeder single, coming 30 years since the Brisbane band’s debut album Flour, and sounding like it could have been ripped from the same sessions. Despite the fuzzy guitar, 90s pop production and Lloyd’s distinctly twee melodies, Don’t Get Me Started is a tune built for 2022, referencing Trump’s less-than-stellar advice to stare at the sun to avoid Covid, imploring people to turn away from their smartphones, and yearning for slower, more thoughtful reflection in a world of hot takes and reactive culture wars (not to mention the real wars). “Time feels like it doesn’t exist any more anyway,” muses Lloyd in the presser for this single, and listening to Don’t Get Me Started, it seems she has a point. For more: New album Five Rooms is due out 8 May. The band is touring in June. For fans of: the B-52s, Wavves, Passion Pit If Prince grew up on the beaches of California, riding a longboard and studying the vocal harmonies of the Beach Boys, he would have arrived at a sound similar to this slinky, sunburnt tune from Hobsons Bay Coast Guard. Love Song has more falsetto than the entire Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, wrapped in tremolo runs and funky chorused-out guitars that urge you to either catch a wave or hit the surf club dancefloor and boogie. Love Song is the latest single from HBCG’s album Tubular Swells, which is chock-full of the same frenetic songwriting and genre-leaping contained here. For more: Listen to Tubular Swells, or the band’s 2019 self-titled debut. For fans of: Bob Dylan, Paul Kelly, Will Oldham Archie Roach has spent the last few years looking back. He penned his moving memoir Tell Me Why, re-recorded his classic 1990 debut album Charcoal Lane, and will soon release an anthology spanning his entire career, before heading out on his final national tour. Fittingly, Roach’s new song ends his best-of collection and finds Roach sharing ancient wisdom, reaching across waters, land and time to instruct the younger generations: “Remember well what we have told you, and don’t forget where you come from. Mother earth will always hold you, and you are born of just one song.” Roach’s voice is a remarkable instrument, no longer imbued with the pure, youthful timbre of his earliest work, instead worn and cracked with experience, like hands calloused from a lifetime of honest, good work. This is a beautiful, timeless tune. Hopefully there are many more to follow. For more: My Songs: 1989-2021 is out on 11 March. For fans of: the Shins, Spoon, Iron and Wine Another sublime single from Australia’s most consistent pop band, Stars in My Eyes questions the faulty mechanics of memory as vocalist Sam Cromack looks back on his past romantic self and wonders how much of what he felt was actually real. He also casts forward to the present, hoping he is still able to conjure that same starry-eyed view of life. Like all nostalgia worth its weight, it is bittersweet and blurry, soundtracked nicely by jangly guitars that swoop in and out, and Cromack’s falsetto leaps in the chorus. As with last year’s Sunscreen, this tune adopts a wonky structure, with more than a little ELO informing the spacey distorted last half. Ball Park Music’s forthcoming album, Weirder and Weirder, was recorded in the band’s home studio in Brisbane, and the extra space and time to stretch out experimentally seems to have resulted in their best instincts coming to the fore. For more: Weirder and Weirder is out 3 June. The band will tour nationally in support of the album. For fans of: Hayley Mary, the Go-Betweens, the Stone Roses A glimmering shard of sunshine through heavy curtains, She Don’t Need No One contains many small moments of poetic romance: a seatbelt tan line from driving topless in the sun; a momentary crush spawned from the brief touch of an arm; a city not feeling the same any more, despite a 40C day. Sydney four-piece Jet City Sports Club formed in mid-2020 as the pandemic raged. Somehow they managed to enter a studio during this time to lay down an EP’s worth of scorched pop anthems which yearn for lazy summer days that seem now like remnants of a distant past, both sonically and thematically. She Don’t Need No One builds upon this template, with a widescreen sound and an emotive, chiming vocal. Hopefully, they will be able to tour the country soon, brightening the corners of the nation. For more: Check out their debut EP September Sun. For fans of: Sonic Youth, Placebo, Magic Dirt It’s been four long years since Body Type released new music, a curiously long wait given the momentum built from their twin EPs, rave reviews from the cooler music media around the world, and tours of the UK and US. As with any unexpected period of inactivity these days, the answer is obvious: Covid. Sex & Rage was actually recorded, along with the rest of the band’s forthcoming debut album, in early 2020, before the pandemic laid waste to society (and release dates) as we know it. Two years is a long time, but luckily Sex & Rage explodes out of the gate with an urgency that sounds like it was recorded just the other day. A dissonant lead guitar squarks throughout the entire song as vocalist Sophie McComish bemoans the banality of modern life while celebrating any drips of passion that can be squeezed from it. It’s a decidedly post-Covid notion, backed by a steam-engine rhythm section and some very present production from Jonathan Boulet. For more: Debut album Everything Is Dangerous But Nothing’s Surprising is out 20 May. For fans of: Lucinda Williams, Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris Bones and Jones’s Ginger Gold was an easy contender for Australian album of the year in 2021 – except nobody seemed to be paying attention. Filled to the brim with countrified tunes that seem to breathe the same mountain air as the storied troubadours of Laurel Canyon in the late 60s, it was music well removed from the times. Same goes for Friendly Neighbour, which sees the six-piece team with fellow Melburnians Folk Bitch Trio for a relaxing slice of Americana. With a chorus built upon a rising major scale countered with tumbling drums and more than a liberal smearing of pedal steel, this is a masterful and heartfelt single, apparently recorded in a disused apple cool room. You can almost hear the crispness.

3/5/2022,"Australia’s drugs regulator has admitted that new social media advertising laws restricting the way therapeutic goods such as vitamins, supplements and skin products can be advertised on social media will be not be possible to enforce in cases where brands and social media influencers are posting from overseas. The laws come into effect from July, and will bring social media advertising of therapeutic goods in line with regulations that apply to radio, television and other mediums. Anyone who receives payment or other incentives to promote a product, whether it’s vitamins or an anti-fungal cream, will not be allowed to offer a testimonial on social media based on their personal experience of using it. This includes using “before and after” photos – a hallmark of many promotions for spurious products that claim to promote weight loss. Influencers can still receive payment to support or endorse the product, and must continue to make it clear in any endorsement that they have been paid. Prescription and certain pharmacist-only medicines are prohibited from being advertised directly to the public altogether, and this has always been the case. Once the changes come into effect, an influencer can say that a herbal product “promotes hair growth” but they can no longer say: “My hair grew five inches after using this”. Testimonials from customers who bought the product themselves and who did not receive any incentives are still allowed. Any historical promotions on social media that have been incentivised and include testimonials, or make claims beyond what the approved purpose of a product is, must also be deleted before July. The changes have distressed some influencers who built their brand on being paid money or given freebies in exchange for their testimonials about products that claim to lead to weight loss, glowing skin or better health. “For beauty creators, this has the potential to be career destroying,” a self-described lifestyle influencer with more than 40,000 followers from the ACT wrote on Instagram this week in response to news of the regulations. “Forcing thousands of creators to delete their life’s work is not a fair resolution to the real issues that these laws are attempting to solve,” she wrote. An “influencer coach” based in Perth with more than 400,000 followers wrote on Instagram that the TGA changes are “basically saying that consumers are too dumb to make an informed decision before making a commitment to purchase”. But advertising executive and strategist Dee Madigan described their protestations as “fairly inane”. “Governments regulate to protect people from their own stupidity all the time,” she said. “We know you’re 80% more likely to buy something at the recommendation of a friend than a brand, and influencers, to many people, are like aspirational friends that they follow on social media.” Madigan said running an advertisement on television involves getting clearance from a regulatory board, and that it is “really, really difficult” get advertisements making health claims past advertising regulators. “But I think the internet for a long time has been put into the too-hard basket,” Madigan said. “It’s seen as too tough to regulate. But I think it could work really well for platforms like Instagram if they cooperate with the regulators on this.” Dr Gemma Sharp, a clinical psychologist and body image expert with Monash University’s department of psychiatry said vulnerable people with body image issues and eating disorders could be particularly susceptible to the health and wellness claims being made by social media influencers. She said despite the claims of many influencers that they are independent, “we’re all being influenced by each other, there is no such thing as real objectivity”. “That’s why disclosures and transparency around their claims are so important,” Sharp said. “However, social media moderation is a minefield. We’re retrospectively trying to moderate something that has been around for 15 years. I think enforcement will be interesting. How are the regulators going to police this?” Regulator the Therapeutic Goods Administration received 1,997 reports of alleged non-compliance with the advertising requirements of the Therapeutic Goods Act between 1 July and March across all mediums including online, radio, in stories and clinics and on television. Australian public health doctor Ken Harvey, who is a researcher in consumer protection and evidence-based medicine, said the need for the TGA to prioritise complaints due to the volume they received meant “most are ignored, even those complaints in what the TGA say are high priority areas”. Harvey wants all testimonials around therapeutic goods banned, even those not paid for, because “anecdotes do not equal strong evidence”. He believes the advertising guidelines should also ban endorsements altogether. “I think there’s a question about whether testimonials and endorsements do actually enhance the use of medicines or allow people to select products rationally,” he said. “The other point is, I don’t really believe that these new rules are enforceable. If someone tosses money underhand to an influencer, and they don’t declare it, who’s going to know?”. A spokeswoman for the TGA admitted that content posted by a social media influencer based overseas would be unlikely to be within the TGA’s jurisdiction, whether or not the content is visible to audiences in Australia. But she said the TGA had already established relationships with Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and other platforms to support compliance with the law changes through their own policies. “In addition, as part of its communication activities to support the transition to the new Advertising Code, the TGA will be publishing a series of posts on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to educate influencers on how to comply with the rules with visual examples of what is acceptable and what is not,” she said. “The TGA encourages the reporting of posts that consumers suspect may be in breach of the Code and advertising law.” Therapeutic goods are not ordinary consumer goods, she said. They can impact health and carry side effects. “Personal testimonials can be inappropriately persuasive to a vulnerable audience who are seeking products for their health and sometimes very serious health conditions,” she said. “The new Code clarifies the type of testimonials that can be used in advertising and ensures that testimonials are unbiased and not influenced by commercial interests or personal gain, while still allowing the advertising of goods without testimonials.”",News/Australia news,"Overseas social media influencers can likely evade Australia’s new advertising laws, drug regulator says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/05/overseas-social-media-influencers-can-likely-evade-australias-new-advertising-laws-drug-regulator-says
3/5/2022,"In the small town of Ocean Shores, on the coast in New South Wales’ northern rivers, Rosie Wild has been grappling with the scale of what she has lost. Every room of her home has been ruined by the floods. Her furniture sits in piles out the front of her house, rendered useless by the damage, as does her fridge and other white goods. Her walls and wooden floors still show no sign of drying out. In the daytime, between the clean-up and her calls to the insurance company, there’s enough to keep Wild’s mind busy. But in the evenings, when the distractions disappear, her mind has been wandering. “It’s all a bit devastating and personally, in the day, I’m just being strong and just going and doing what I need to do,” she said. “But in the evenings, it just dawns on you. It’s such a loss.” The scale of the devastation in the areas around Mullumbimby is quickly becoming apparent. It’s another disaster site in what are now being described as the worst floods in living memory. The death toll rose to 16 on Friday, including six in NSW, after the body of a man in his 40s was found south of Murwillumbah, just north of Mullumbimby. Four more people have died in flood-ravaged Lismore and the estimated cost of claims across Queensland and NSW is now just over $1bn. For Wild, as she grapples with what comes next, the $1,000 disaster payment offered by the federal government seems grossly inadequate. “At the end of the day, it’s very, very disappointing,” she said. “After I’d done my entire clean-up, I went back to my partner’s house, and worked out that all I was going to get is $1,000 … I’ll probably have to go out and get another loan.” The coordination of the response has also been lacking, she said, leaving locals to rely on one another. It’s a frequent complaint in the area. There’s general goodwill towards the state emergency service and Australian Defence Force who are working in the region, tirelessly, to help. But many who spoke to Guardian Australia are also clear on one thing: the state and federal government response in the area has been insufficient. Locals have banded together and stepped in to fill gaps in the response, organising rescues, food and fuel drops, and beginning the arduous task of cleaning up. Megan Whitaker, a resident of Lennox Head for 17 years, described the government response as a “catastrophic failure”. It’s an opinion born of her own experience during the floods. Whitaker was trapped in Melbourne as the waters peaked, but received a desperate call from a friend, who was trapped with her husband on Tamar street in Ballina. Her friend’s husband was passing in and out of consciousness. Fearing for their safety, Whitaker called emergency services and urged them to rescue the pair. The emergency services, she said, left her with little certainty as to whether they could help in time. She turned to local Facebook community groups, where she found a woman whose father lived in Tamar street. The father, a local surf lifesaver, pledged to take a dinghy to get to the pair. “They managed to, after a number of hours, evacuate the husband, who needed medical attention,” Whittaker said. “But they didn’t have enough room to evacuate my friend and her dog. So I had to repeat the whole process about five or six hours later, when her battery was running low and the waters were potentially going to peak again. I had to once again call the SES, get through to NSW, post on a Facebook page.” Her friend eventually got out and Whitaker has spent the days since acting as a conduit for communications between flood-affected residents and emergency services. It’s not something that should be left up to her, she said. “This has been a catastrophic failure of government to provide the services we pay for as taxpayers,” she said. “The impact of this is going to be so far reaching and for so long. I’m just so angry.” Speaking on Friday, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, said some mistakes are likely to be made during the response, but that it was too early to ascribe blame. Perrotet said the government was “completely focused” on getting responders into flood hit areas but it could only be done where safe. “Our focus right now is not on playing the blame game,” he said.

The pair live on Bishops Creek road near Nimbin and Lismore, and were forced to flee when a landslide came perilously close to their home. They sheltered at a neighbour’s while the flood waters receded, and then walked 4km, climbing through roads and washed away creeks to be met by their neighbour’s sister to drive to Nimbin for supplies. On Thursday, Mark helped an elderly neighbour get to hospital, using his 4WD. “It’s exhausting,” Celeste said. “I’m so stressed, PTSD, whenever it rains I’m in fear of landslides, the sound of thunder is terrifying as it sounds like a landslide. “Yes, we do feel forgotten.”",News/Australia news,‘Catastrophic failure’: fury among NSW northern rivers locals ‘forgotten’ by authorities,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/05/catastrophic-failure-fury-among-nsw-northern-rivers-locals-forgotten-by-authorities
3/5/2022,"In the third hour of the 18th day in constable Zachary Rolfe’s trial for murder, the Northern Territory police officer who had so far sat masked and mute in the courtroom was thrust into the fray. “Your honour, my client does propose to give evidence in his defence and we’re in a position to start now, if that’s convenient to the court?” David Edwardson QC said on Wednesday. After Judge John Burns confirmed it was convenient, Edwardson said: “I call Zachary Rolfe”. Rolfe, a short man with an upright gait, had spent most of the week in the witness box, perched on the edge of his seat. Since the start of the trial, he has let his stubble grow. During the trial, Rolfe’s voice had hitherto only been heard when audio from body-worn camera footage considered central to the case boomed throughout the courtroom from televisions overhead, and when he said “not guilty” at the start of the trial. His evidence is the first time he has detailed why, on the night of 9 November 2019, he shot Kumanjayi Walker three times while trying to arrest him in the remote community of Yuendumu. Burns told the court that although Rolfe had thus far maintained his right to silence by not participating in police interviews, they should not draw any unfavourable conclusions from that. During his evidence, Rolfe turned side to side while speaking, making an effort to face the eight men and five women in the jury who have been separated to opposite walls of the court to mitigate a potential Covid-19 outbreak. He started with the broad brushstrokes of his life: he was born in Canberra in 1991, completed high school there, joined the Army, where he spent five years from 2010 onwards, and then spent 10 months doing “odd jobs” in Canberra before joining the NT police. He later clarified that during this 10-month period he also spent four to five weeks training in the US state of Arkansas with Trojan Securities International, where he completed hostage rescue, counter ambush driving, and weapons familiarisation courses to “upskill” himself. In May 2016, he moved to Darwin to start his training with the NT police force. He spoke about the breadth and detail of his police training. How he first became aware of an incident in which Walker used an axe to threaten two Yuendumu police officers who were trying to arrest him (“Kumanjayi Walker was lucky that he didn’t get shot that day”). And how Rolfe happened to come face to face with Walker in a dark room of a Yuendumu property known as House 511 only 15 minutes after leaving the local police station. But Rolfe’s evidence was mostly about the 3.1 seconds that it took for him to shoot Walker three times. Prosecutor Philip Strickland SC said in opening his case that Rolfe had no legal justification for firing the second and third shots, and given that they were fired from point blank range, Rolfe intended either to kill or seriously harm Walker. As Edwardson said in his opening to the case, Rolfe’s defence is that he was acting in good faith, in the reasonable performance of his duties, and in the self-defence of himself and Eberl when he fired the shots at Walker. “What is not in dispute … is that in the face of that spontaneous attack with an edged weapon, constable Rolfe was justified in drawing his police firearm and firing a shot into the back of Mr Walker – shot one,” Edwardson previously told the court. “What is in dispute is whether, within the space of a couple of seconds, the subsequent discharge of two further shots into Kumanjayi Walker was unlawful. “It is the defence position that constable Rolfe, having been stabbed by a known violent offender and having lawfully shot him once, was justified in continuing to defend his mate and fellow police officer who was just doing his job.” What Edwardson had not said during his opening was in many ways the most fascinating part of Rolfe’s evidence this week: that the police officer claims Walker had his hand on his firearm, seemingly in an attempt to take it from him, only moments before the first shot was fired, and that he saw Walker stabbing Eberl in the chest and neck when shots two and three were fired. Rolfe later agreed that camera footage did not show the hand resting on his gun, and he did not think it showed Eberl being stabbed. He also clarified that it was his “impression” and “perception” that Eberl was being stabbed, and that he had not physically seen Walker’s scissors touch his body. Eberl was found to have a small scratch under his left shoulder several days after the incident, but he has given evidence that he could not recall this injury having occurred during his struggle with Walker. Under cross-examination from Strickland, Rolfe denied that he had made up that Walker touched his gun or that he had seen him stabbing Eberl, and other parts of his evidence, or that he had rehearsed answers. When these claims were put to him by Strickland, Rolfe answered “incorrect”. Strickland was building to what he considers a singular point, that he believed was best emphasised by playing to the jury Rolfe’s own words from immediately after the shooting, which can be heard in the body-worn camera footage. Rolfe told Eberl the shooting was “all good” as he had been stabbing them both.

Strickland then asked Rolfe: “How was the situation all good?” “A violent offender was trying to murder two police officers and he no longer was,” Rolfe responded. Soon after that, and after a few more questions from Edwardson, it was over. Rolfe stood at the stand, took a long sip from a plastic cup of water, and then made his way back into the body of the court, removing his mask from his left pocket and placing it over his face as he went.

3/5/2022,"“I’ve never been to war before, but when you see a dead body and you know you just have to report it and then keep going. How do I even explain what this is?,” said Keitah Martens-Shaw. The 29-year-old has this week paused her life as a wellbeing and mental health entrepreneur in Byron Bay to work as an emergency responder conducting rescues in the flood ravaged areas around New South Wales’s northern rivers. Her transformation is much like that of Mullumbimby, which has turned from a laid back community into a disaster zone. The devastation in nearby Lismore dominated media attention in the aftermath of flooding this week. However over in “Mullum”, where the flood waters didn’t rise as high, the extent of damage is now becoming apparent. Landslides and broken roads have cut off scores of residents in the surrounding areas. Homes have been picked up and moved hundreds of metres, and large-off road cars have been crushed and swept away. Sliced bridges jut out from the green bushland, with much of the damage yet to even be understood or reported by authorities. So with the emergency response capacity spread thin across Lismore and around the state, a makeshift community response has sprung into action in Mullumbimby to fill the gaps the officials couldn’t. The local civic hall on Dalley Street now resembles a military base, and is run with military-like efficiency, with an ad-hoc group of leaders coordinating a sea of volunteers from the town and region who are showing up to help. The dust from the muddy waters carried into towns during flooding is thick in the air. It was bustling on Friday, as hundreds of locals arrived out the front of the hall, they were organised into teams based on their skills, and sent off into the hinterland to check on those not heard from in days. Others are asked to take food, water, or jerrycans of petrol to cut off residents, with organisers drawing up a whiteboard of addresses based of word of mouth and social media posts. Properties to visit are listed by priority, with some including residents living alone, unheard from since before the flooding. “I need six volunteers for labour, moving heavy items,” one of the organisers shouts, as seven people raise their hands almost instantly and are in a vehicle on their way to a home in less than a minute. “It’s an absolute nightmare,” Jacqui Lewis says, abruptly walking away to take a phone call from an army official consulting the volunteer group for information. “I need these people airlifted,” she said. Lewis, who ordinarily works in communications, says thousands have come through the civic hall this week, including those donating food and other supplies in such high quantities that the building next door has been commandeered as a sorting centre. Water and free meals are also available. Meanwhile, a van carrying donated supplies pulls up. One of the designated organisers – a woman in her fifties – shouts “I need four strong men for an easy job, two minutes, to help unload that van”. The van is emptied and the delivery spot is cleared. Lewis says the scene has been getting busier and more chaotic each day, as locals finishing with their own immediate flood recovery needs become available to assist. “But we desperately need more ADF mobilised here now,” she said. “Volunteers are coming-in, going-out, and coming back in again to do more. These are civilians doing rescues, they’re not trained for this,” Lewis said, before hurrying off to someone shouting her name. Martens-Shaw is one of those locals performing rescues. After the immensity of the flood recovery became apparent, she and two of her friends decided they “were keen to get our hands dirty and help”. As experienced divers and canyoners who own four wheel drives, the women were immediately sent on rescue on missions, and had done four so far this week. Most are gruelling, entire day endeavours that involve driving to a broken road and trekking through water and mud for hours to reach a cut-off property. “We’re in wetsuits going through hip-deep water, flooding roads, rapids, landslides, carrying grocery bags and not knowing what we’re going to find,” she said. On Thursday, the group discovered a man in his 70s with a heart condition who had no reception or road access and had been unaccounted for since before floods. After he hugged each one of the group, an emergency services helicopter airlifted him to safety. The group then hiked back to Mullumbimby with the man’s dog, Bentley. The group – which comprises musicians, divers, tradies, entrepreneurs and marketing professionals – have since adopted the name “Bentley’s Crew”. However other rescue missions have been far more gruesome. On Friday, they were attempting to visit several isolated locations they had been tipped off to from social media, when they discovered a body. “His body was just there in the water. We called the SES (state emergency services) right away to report it. “It was pretty fucked up, we all found it very confronting. We’ve never experienced this before, you know, we’ve all put our jobs on pause to be here. “When we saw the body it hit home just how important this work is we’re doing, and how important it is that people worried about someone get in touch so we can check on them. Possessions and homes are of secondary importance at this point. In and around Mullumbimby there are still people that we don’t know if they’re OK,” she said. Police later announced the discovery of a 40-year-old man’s body near Terragon – where the crew had been on Friday. Throughout the week the local SES crew, the Fire and Rescue agency, the volunteer Rural Fire Service and defence force personnel have been criticised for not having a presence in town, facing claims they had forgotten Mullumbimby. Byron Shire Council deputy mayor, Sarah Ndiaye, was at pains to stress this wasn’t the case, and said the SES station in town had coordinated rescues. So too were the organisers at civic hall, who believe the claims made on social media are making a small and overworked SES volunteer base frustrated. Captain of the local Mullumbimby Fire and Rescue NSW branch, John Rushton, is honest about how overworked the various government rescue teams are across the region, and watches the ongoing operation at Civic Hall – located next to his station – with awe. “I’ve never seen that level of community engagement operating in such a functional way in my career,” Rushton said. “They’re running like an army,” he said. Part of this is because many of the organisers formerly worked with official state emergency organisations. Mullumbimby had one of Australia’s lowest vaccination rates before Covid, and uptake of the coronavirus vaccines has been low. “I had four of my best members leave after the vaccine mandate, and I know the SES has lost even more because of it,” he said. Now, many of those skilled emergency responders are performing the jobs they would have been, in an unofficial capacity, based out of the civic hall. “The civic hall is being run in the same way you’d run any state agency, it’s sensational,” Rushton said. Over at the centre, organisers are figuring out how to make the most of other donations. Throughout the week, piles of ruined furniture have lined suburban streets since flooding peaked on Monday, as the town – without diesel, phone reception, internet and credit card facilities for days – reverted to a cash-based society reliant on word of mouth for news. The collapse of telecommunications in the region has dramatically hampered the recovery effort. On Friday, one local business owner donated equipment to boost phone and internet reception in the cut-off hinterland. Organisers had to figure out how to transport it there. As the community effort in Mullumbimby pushes on, locals are pleading for more federal assistance. And as telecommunications are gradually restored, they’re also desperate for their plight to be recognised. For Martens-Shaw the disconnection between the lives now being led here and just a few dozen kilometres away is striking. “When I drive back to Byron each night and everyones just doing their Byron thing, I think ‘You’ve got no idea what I’ve seen today’. People have no clue what’s happening just half an hour away.”",News/Australia news,‘His body was just there’: Mullumbimby volunteers confronted by horrors and chaos of flood aftermath,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/05/his-body-was-just-there-mullumbimby-volunteers-confronted-by-horrors-and-chaos-of-flood-aftermath
3/5/2022,"Those born in 1990 have grown up in an Australia that is more unequal, where those with family support find it easier to get ahead and where significant life milestones are taking longer or have become unreachable for some. The 12th instalment of the Life Chances report from the Brotherhood of St Laurence explores some of the reasons why. The small longitudinal study began in 1990 in two inner Melbourne suburbs by tracking 167 babies and their parents over a diverse range of backgrounds over time. Three decades on, participants were interviewed as they turned 30 to better understand issues around economic security. It found constraints on social security, a lack of affordable child care, housing costs and an increasingly precarious employment market were entrenching patterns of inequality, particularly among women. Dr Dina Bowman, the principal research fellow at the Brotherhood of St Laurence and co-author of the report, said 30 was a “threshold” age where people would once have their lives settled but were now finding their lives “more uncertain”. Participants in the study described a general sense that obtaining significant life goals, such as a “proper job”, a home, a car and starting a family, were “taking longer”, and those who did not have access to family help to find their first job or housing struggled. “For many now, it was like a distant dream. They couldn’t see how they could have these things, ever,” Bowman said. “And it’s interesting to look across the period of changes of the study. It reflects policy changes over that time. “What we found was there is this kind of implicit or explicit policy change over the past 30 years, there has been an increased reliance on the family safety net. “This is inherently unequal. Not everyone’s family can provide support as is required.” Bowman said these trends could be reversed by rebuilding the social security system and introducing other social policies to “even up the odds”. The Australian National University Prof Peter Whiteford said the study was valuable for “putting real stories behind statistics” and said those born in 1990 in Australia had lived a “very complicated story”. Born two years before the recession of 1992, and having entered their teenage years during the boom years of the early 2000s, many graduated into an increasingly uncertain labour market following the global financial crisis. “We had this incredible period of prosperity, but what did we do with it really? We actually gave tax cuts to higher income people and older people,” Whiteford said. “But one of the other things that’s happened is the social security system has become much more restrictive in ways we don’t quite realise unless you have lived through it.” One study participant, Ruby Mountford, said they were “lucky” to come from a professional family who have been able to give them support when they needed. The 31-year-old from Preston, Melbourne, was diagnosed with autism and ADHD while at university in 2015, spent a spell unemployed as they worked through their diagnosis and recently started work in the disability sector. Their job is government-funded, so while they were not living cheque-to-cheque, it remained “precarious”. “It was difficult for me, even with all the support I had. It’s impossible for other folks,” Mountford said. “Not only is it taking longer, it’s not as possible to achieve. Everyone wants to talk about merit, but that implies science when we know for a fact everyone has deeply entrenched biases and it’s really hard to change the status quo. “Most of us are just seeing unchecked greed and corruption fuck our lives up.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Sarah, another participant who asked her surname not be used, is a 31-year-old from Reservoir, Melbourne. The daughter of a “by the book” boiler attendant, her mother passed away when she was five. Sarah said her sister first found her a job as a dog groomer at 18 handling clients that included Bert Newton. Today she has a trade, a son, four dogs and no debt, except for the two-person unit she and her husband bought with the help of his parents. “I’m not lucky. I wasn’t brought up in this world lucky,” Sarah said. “There’s lots of little things people don’t see when they say you’re lucky. “In my experience, I’ve had really good support. You can’t do much if you haven’t got much. It’s not just going to appear out of nowhere. “If you’ve got money, you can change things in the world.” Ruth, a parent whose youngest son is a study participant and who came from a modest background, said while she did not feel compelled to support her children other parents might as they “try to fit into a wonky system”. Despite discriminatory gender norms when she was growing up, Ruth said there had been federal government programs to support women getting an education and entering the workforce – but now things had changed. “It did not really cross my mind as a 30-year-old that life wasn’t going to be OK in some form,” she said. “That’s my biggest worry. Where does hope come into all this? “I just feel the kids now, it’s every man for himself.

3/5/2022,"The Australian government pushed to soften the wording of a major report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s leading climate science authority, to say the Great Barrier Reef is not yet in crisis. It has prompted accusations that the Morrison government had been “unscientific and dishonest”, and was trying to play down the damage already being caused by global heating to avoid making deeper cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. The latest major assessment by the IPCC, released this week, included a section headed: “The Great Barrier Reef is in crisis”. It said the world’s largest coral reef was already heavily affected by climate change, particularly ocean heating, which was leading to more frequent and severe coral bleaching. The 2,300km reef system has endured mass bleaching events in three of the past six years. A bulletin by the International Institute for Sustainable Development, a global thinktank, said Australian government officials suggested in a meeting about the wording of a report summary that it should say the reef was “not yet in crisis” and “coral reefs are under increasing pressure, but targeted measures and management could reduce risk”. They were supported by officials from Saudi Arabia. The proposal, which Guardian Australia has confirmed independently, was opposed by France and several Caribbean island countries including Trinidad and Tobago, which argued coral reefs were already experiencing loss and damage. The original wording was ultimately retained in the report by consensus. The director of Blue Ocean Consulting and an adviser to the Australian Marine Conservation Society, Imogen Zethoven, said the trajectory of the reef was dire and the government’s attempt to not have that reflected in the IPCC report was “unscientific”. “Scientists through the IPCC have said that the Great Barrier Reef is in crisis, and there’s a lot about it in the report, but the government has completely denied the crisis the Great Barrier Reef and coral reefs around the world are facing,” she said. “Anything other than claiming coral reefs are in crisis is dishonest.” Some IPCC scientists emphasised that the Australian government had ultimately joined 194 other countries in agreeing to the final wording of the summary report. They said negotiations over the text was normal practice. But the chief executive of Climate Analytics and former IPCC lead author, Bill Hare, said the Morrison government’s attempt to change the wording was consistent with its previous attempts to play down the risk facing the reef. “The claim that the reef is not yet in crisis is quite fundamentally wrong, but it’s symptomatic of what the Australian government had been doing,” Hare said. “This is just the latest iteration.” Guardian Australia last year revealed the government had tried to block the passage of a Unesco recommendation that countries should try to keep global heating to 1.5C to protect world heritage sites such as the reef from the impacts of the climate crisis. Hare said Australian government representatives had also unsuccessfully tried to water down a section of the IPCC report that said ecosystems including some ​​warm water coral reefs were already reaching or surpassing “hard adaptation limits” at which they had limited capacity to adapt to further heating. He said the final report, which summarises thousands of published peer-reviewed scientific studies, was essentially saying that coral reefs were “on the edge”. It said there was “very high confidence” that some natural systems in Australia, including the Great Barrier Reef, had already experienced irreversible change. It found extreme events exacerbated by emissions – heatwaves, droughts, floods, storms and fires – were causing death, injury and financial and emotional stress, and their impacts were “cascading and compounding” across Australia’s nature, society and economy. “There are so many things in this report that are so bad, and the government just wants to ignore them because the only way to deal with them is to get [greenhouse gas] emissions down,” Hare said. “The report shows it is urgent that we increase our emissions reduction target for 2030 to a cut of more than 50%.” The Morrison government has resisted international and domestic pressure to increase its six-year-old target of reducing emissions to at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2030. Official projections suggest the country will cut emissions by 30%. Scientists say this is inconsistent with limiting global heating to well below 2C, a key goal the government signed up to at the landmark 2015 Paris climate summit. A spokesperson for the environment minister, Sussan Ley, confirmed Australia had attempted to change language in the report and said the proposal “was both science-based and accurate, in line with normal practice”. “We fully accept that global climate change needs to be addressed as the biggest threat to the world’s reefs,” the spokesperson said. “The Great Barrier Reef is the best managed reef in the world and our investments in science-based adaptation, regeneration and on-water management show that local science-based strategies are needed to improve resilience as the world reduces emissions, and that they can have a positive impact.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The IPCC report published this week is the second part of its sixth major assessment of the climate crisis. It found global warming caused by humans was causing dangerous and widespread disruption, with many effects expected to be more severe than predicted. It said there were options to limit the impacts if there was proper planning, but progress on adaptation was uneven. A 2018 IPCC report found coral reefs were likely to decline between 70% and 90% if global heating surpassed 1.5C. If the temperature rise reaches 2C, more than 99% of coral reefs were projected to decline. The Australian government last year successfully lobbied against UN scientific advice that the reef should be placed on a list of world heritage sites in danger. The 21-country world heritage committee is due to consider the reef’s plight again in June.",News/Environment,‘Dishonest’: Morrison government wanted IPCC to say Great Barrier Reef ‘not yet in crisis’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/05/dishonest-morrison-government-wanted-ipcc-to-say-great-barrier-reef-not-yet-in-crisis
3/5/2022,"It was dry and sunny in Melbourne 10 days ago when Kimberley Reid was looking at images being spat out by a weather forecasting model – all isobars, arrows and splodges of orange. The phenomenon forming in the atmosphere off Queensland’s coast – about 1500 kilometres (930 miles) north-east of Reid’s computer screen – was nothing remarkable yet, but the channels of moisture she saw in the pictures are the subject of her PhD. “Atmospheric rivers are quite easy to see,” she says. “I thought it didn’t look that strong. I was holding back from tweeting. I didn’t think it was going to get that big.” A few days later, the river got stuck over an area of the Pacific Ocean a few hundred kilometres north of Brisbane. Rain became torrential – like a tsunami from the sky. Politicians called it a “rain bomb”. Towns and cities – tens of thousands of homes and businesses, as well as bridges, roads and dreams – went under water, leaving Australians wondering if they’d been smashed once more by the climate emergency. There were other things happening around the river that Reid saw on the computer weather model. The Bureau of Meteorology says a cold weather system in the upper atmosphere – between eight and 10 kilometres up – had moved north from waters to the south of the continent and was mixing with warmer air from the tropics. An area of low pressure – known as a trough – formed in the Coral Sea, causing moist air to be lifted up, condense and then fall as rain. Usually systems like this pass through and out over the ocean, but the bureau says another atmospheric phenomenon – an area of high pressure much further east – acted as a block. Now all that was needed was the winds that pushed all that moisture over Queensland’s south-east. Reid says atmospheric rivers are long, narrow regions between one and three kilometres up “characterised by really strong water flow. It is like a running river in the sky.” Reid has calculated how much water was in the river as it was flowing over Greater Brisbane. The city itself got almost 80% of its annual rainfall in only six days up to 28 February, when the system started to move south. Brisbane had only ever recorded eight days of more than 200mm before the 2022 floods. But it saw three in a row. Reid says over the course of the two heaviest days of rain, 26 and 27 February, enough water flowed in the atmospheric river above the city to fill Sydney harbour – that holds about 500bn litres – almost 16 times. Reid wants to know how these atmospheric rivers could be influenced by global heating. She thinks these systems could move south along Australia’s east coast and when they do occur, “there’s more moisture in the atmosphere and they’re going to be quite intense.” Reid’s research has looked at an atmospheric river that caused flooding over Sydney in March 2021. “I’ve found that over Sydney, the frequency of these long duration events will increase by 80% by the end of this century,” she says. Atmospheric rivers are under-studied in Australia and her university seniors think she is the first to do a PhD on them. “In the US they fly aeroplanes through them. Here, it’s mostly me doing [the research],” she says. The unprecedented flooding that raised many rivers above record highs moved south, leaving towns underwater. Residents in parts of western Sydney were told to evacuate for the second year in a row as the city’s Warragamba Dam overflowed. But the system stalled before it passed over Sydney. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But the bureau added the combination of atmospheric events was “not unusual in itself.” Australia’s east coast was already wet. A La Niña had pushed warmer ocean water closer to the continent’s east, increasing cloud and rain. So why did it rain so much? The event has seen a flurry of communications between scientists this week, discussing plans to launch different studies to understand what role a changed climate could have had. Burning coal, oil and gas and chopping down forests has loaded the atmosphere with extra greenhouse gases, causing heating. There is now 50% more CO2 in the atmosphere than before the Industrial Revolution. Australia has warmed by 1.4C since 1910. “We’ve added steroids to the climate system that have amplified the rainfall,” says Prof David Karoly, a veteran Australian climate scientist based at the University of Melbourne. While it’s known the atmosphere can hold 7% more moisture for every degree of warming, Karoly explains the extra CO2 could have played several roles. As the moisture condenses into rain droplets, energy is released in the form of heat. Karoly says this sets off a feedback cycle in the atmosphere that amplifies the uplift from the oceans, which are also warmer than they used to be. So the extra 7% could, in real terms, add more than that in rainfall – in some cases more than double, he says. “These weather systems have occurred in the past. But now we have a hotter ocean and a hotter atmosphere and the feedback can give you much bigger rainfall events,” he says. Dr Andrew King, also at the University of Melbourne – a main centre for climate studies in Australia – says scientists will look at what happened from multiple angles. “There’s a thermodynamic part – the moisture – and with that it’s easier to say climate change has enhanced that a bit. “But you also need the lifting motion that produced the rainfall and that is so much more complicated. We don’t fully understand how these weather systems are changing. “Fundamentally, we have altered the planet a huge amount. Every event that occurs in our altered system would look different if we hadn’t done that.” Brisbane’s last major flood was 2011. The city’s river swelled and engulfed suburbs. The images and footage were seen around the world. Mathematician Dr Kate Saunders was living in one of those suburbs. That extreme event was the catalyst for a decade of study into “extreme value theory” – a way to understand things that have never been witnessed. She’s applying that to extreme rainfall using climate models. Saunders left Brisbane to study after the 2011 floods, via CSIRO and the University of Melbourne, and is now back in her home city at QUT in time to witness another tragedy. “What’s really challenging from a statistical perspective is you only have about 11 years of data. But if that climate signal is only becoming stronger, then you’re getting more risk. “For example, how many times have we had to evacuate Brisbane and parts of Sydney in the same week? When you look at how widespread this was, it makes it an outlier in our records.” As the rain fell over Brisbane, houses, parks and $1m mansions around her street went under. This was going to generate a flood of scientific inquiry. “I thought – uh, oh. There’s a lot of work coming here.”",News/Australia news,Anatomy of a ‘rain bomb’: scientists strive to understand phenomenon that caused Australia’s east coast floods,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/05/anatomy-of-a-rain-bomb-scientists-study-phenomenon-2022-australia-east-coast-floods
3/5/2022,"“Sometimes, I have regrets. There have been very tough moments when I felt abandoned. I still feel abandoned. I received threats, I was intimidated and my whole life was compromised.” After everything she has been through, Roseline (not her real name) is just thankful to be alive. At the start of October 2020, the young Haitian referee says she was threatened by the man she accused of sexually abusing her. It was two days after she had given evidence against Rosnick Grant, a former international referee who was vice-president of the Haitian Football Federation and president of its referees’ commission, to members of Fifa’s “ad hoc panel” investigating claims of sexual abuse. “They assured me it was confidential but there was a leak somehow,” Roseline says. “I received death threats.” Fifa has denied any leak, claiming Roseline was targeted as a result of her name being in local media. Roseline called a member of Fifa’s ad hoc panel for help but, by the time they responded 48 hours later, she had already been moved to a safe place. “It was only because of your help that I’m still alive,” she tells the Guardian. A few weeks earlier, Fifa was sent a letter from another female referee, this time in Zimbabwe. Muzwudzani (not her real name) claimed to have been subjected to repeated sexual harassment by Obert Zhoya, a senior member of the technical staff of the Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) and secretary general of Zifa’s referees committee. Zhoya did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. Muzwudzani also provided evidence of her allegations to world football’s governing body, to the Confederation of African Football (Caf) and to the Council of Southern Africa Football Associations. The case is now being investigated by police in Zimbabwe, having been referred to Caf by Fifa because it “did not have the competence to investigate and judge such conducts”. Muzwudzani hasn’t taken charge of a match since, while Zhoya remains in his position. “I had hoped that one day I would make it on to the Fifa panel,” she says. “I could have played netball or soccer but I opted for officiating because I loved it. I looked at referees and I admired them. I used to think: ‘One day I wish to be there. One day I wish to wear a kit that has those four letters – Fifa – written on it.’ But someone has taken that away from me.” Muzwudzani’s story, published in January, is the latest example in a series of investigations of allegations of sexual abuse or harassment by the Guardian across world football. It’s a seam of stories that began in the UK with the former Crewe player Andy Woodward, a survivor, speaking about years of abuse by the coach Barry Bennell. Bennell was among 13 former youth coaches to have been sent to prison after the Guardian helped expose widespread abuse in British football that took place during the 1970s and 80s. But as well as high-profile cases in Afghanistan and in Haiti, where separate Guardian investigations led to the presidents of both FAs being banned for life by Fifa, other countries where the outcomes are unclear or not yet known have illustrated the inadequacies of the existing system. The Guardian has been alerted to allegations of more than 40 serious cases of sexual abuse or harassment in senior or international football in countries from all around the globe including Argentina, Australia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Gabon, Mongolia, Spain, the United States and Venezuela. Not all of them have been reported to Fifa. Some of the alleged victims are girls or young women; others are boys or young men. They are from countries where the accused are often part of the same power structure, making it even harder for them to report their abuse. And persuading Fifa to listen may be the start of a tortuous process for them and their families, with survivors in Afghanistan and Haiti having claimed that their concerns were disregarded or treated carelessly and their lives were even placed in danger. A Fifa spokesperson said all complaints are “handled with the greatest of care and in the strictest of confidence”. But a source who worked on both investigations says: “In almost every case they have made procedural errors. We are just going around in circles – nothing is actually changing.” It has been nearly four years since Saima (not her real name) travelled to Jordan for a training camp with Afghanistan’s women’s team. The trip was organised by Khalida Popal, a former head of the women’s football department at the Afghan Football Federation (AFF), who had been forced to flee the country in 2016 and seek asylum in Denmark. It would end up being unforgettable for all the wrong reasons. According to Popal, two male officials that had been sent by the AFF to accompany the squad repeatedly bullied and harassed her and other players. “It continued,” Popal told the Guardian in November 2018. “These guys were calling on the rooms of the players and sleeping with the girls. AFF staff members would say to girls that they could get them on the team list and would pay them £100 a month if they would say yes to everything. They were pushing and forcing the girls. Coercing them.” A few weeks later, Saima and eight other players were suddenly dropped from the national team and accused of being lesbians. The AFF president, Keramuudin Karim, who had assured Popal that he would take “serious action” over the harassment claims in Jordan, was alleged to have beaten one of the players with a snooker cue after reports that she was considering telling her story to the media. Popal began her own investigation and said she discovered that Karim, a former governor of Panjshir province and chief of staff in the defence ministry before he took over the presidency of the AFF in 2004, had been accused of multiple counts of sexual and physical abuse. She said he even had a room inside his office containing a bed. “The doors of his office [use] fingerprint recognition, so when players go in they can’t get out without the fingerprint of the president,” she claimed. Popal and the team’s head coach from 2016 to 2020, Kelly Lindsey, a former US international, said they attempted to report their findings to the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) but hit a brick wall. “They basically said: ‘We can’t speak to you about this because you’re not a member association, we need your president or your general secretary to speak with us,’” recalls Lindsey. Fifa seemed to take more interest at first. Having recorded testimonies from several players, including interviewing Saima and her teammate Farzana (not her real name) over the previous six months, football’s governing body confirmed in November 2018 that it was examining allegations of widespread sexual abuse in Afghanistan, including several claims made against the AFF president. One alleged victim told the Guardian that Karim had put a gun to her head after he punched her in the face and sexually assaulted her, before threatening to shoot her and her family if she spoke to the media. “When we came forward and told our stories, of course Karim found out it was us, even though a good job was done to keep our identities out of the press,” Farzana says. “Life became quite dangerous for us. Every day there were threats, we were continuously receiving phone calls from the federation, from Karim’s people, offering money and things, they were trying to buy us. That was scary and dangerous.” Despite evidence provided by several alleged victims, however, the investigation dragged on. “In our eyes we were doing Fifa a favour, we were bringing these allegations to life so it could solve them, so it could be the good guy,” Lindsey says. “After seven or eight months of conversation after conversation without any official process or system really seeming to be in place, it felt like we were going nowhere. We gave Fifa enough time to take action but it didn’t.” A Fifa spokesperson said that it had responded to allegations of sexual abuse in Afghanistan in early 2018. “Once these reports were received, Fifa immediately began to investigate these serious allegations in a way that would ensure, first and foremost, the safety and security of the victims and survivors,” he said. Two days before Karim was banned for life from all football-related activity and fined 1 million Swiss francs in June 2019 after a Fifa investigation found him guilty of sexually abusing “various female players”, the Guardian revealed that Fifa had been made aware of sexual abuse allegations against Karim more than two years earlier. A formal complaint alleging abuse of players from the Afghanistan women’s team was sent in April 2017 by 34 of the provincial football presidents in Afghanistan to senior officials of Fifa, the AFC, including its official integrity-reporting email account; and the Afghan federation. A Fifa spokesperson said: “Alleged representatives of the Afghan provincial associations sent emails to various staff in Fifa in 2017, which made various claims and allegations about candidates and the AFF elections that were due to be held at that time. The various claims and allegations made to Fifa at the time were difficult to verify for two reasons: 1. the attachments/enclosures mentioned in the emails were never provided and 2. Fifa staff could not travel to Afghanistan for a fact-finding mission due to the serious security constraints within the country.” For Popal, however, that explanation does not suffice and the failure to investigate the claims in 2017 meant Karim was allowed “to continue abusing and destroying the lives of innocent footballers. The fact that, after reporting the abuses, Fifa took so long shows how much they care about footballers and their lives. Every time I look into the eyes of those young girls I see the justice that was needed but didn’t come.” Popal and Lindsey aided both Saima and Farzana in leaving the country, helping to source visas for them to fly to India before they were moved to Switzerland. Saima and Farzana say it was only once they were on Fifa’s doorstep that it properly took over, paying for their hotels so they wouldn’t have to go into refugee camps until they were eventually housed by the government. “Fifa didn’t support us in the beginning, they didn’t take any responsibility the way they should have done,” Saima says. “Khalida and Kelly were doing their best to get us to a second country and save our lives. Fifa covered the costs of hotel accommodation and then we moved to the apartment, the government took over the responsibility.” Fifa also helped Saima’s and Farzana’s families move to Pakistan as they were at risk in Afghanistan. Both women hoped they would also be able to join them in Switzerland and claim that they were given assurances they would reunited after six months – something that has been denied by Fifa. It is understood that they signed a contract which made no guarantees about their families being relocated given that it was reliant on the visa process, over which Fifa had no influence. “Fifa has and continues to offer support and assistance to ensure the safety of survivors, as well as to witnesses who choose to come forward and give testimony in Fifa ethics harassment and abuse cases,” said the spokesperson. “Such support includes, but is not limited to, working with local experts to provide psychological counselling, medical care and support, safe refuge, legal assistance, as well as providing for safe refuge support where possible to immediate family members that may also be at risk.” Saima and Farzana are now unsure whether their families should remain in Pakistan or return to Afghanistan, where the Taliban took control last year. “Our families are suffering because of us, they are displaced and now the danger is greater than before as our enemies have got all the power they need from the changes in the country,” Farzana says. At the end of February 2020, Yves Jean-Bart received a phone call. It was only a few weeks since the former journalist known as “Dadou” had been elected as president of the Haitian Football Federation (FHF) for the sixth time, with Gianni Infantino congratulating him by sending a letter that had been hand-signed “Cher Yves” by the Fifa president. But on the other end of the line was a member of staff from the office of Véron Mosengo-Omba, who was then working as Fifa’s chief member associations officer. As well as discussing how Haiti would respond to the impending Covid pandemic, the Fifa official also wanted to “raise concerns” about alleged sexual abuse cases in the country’s national football centre, the Centre Technique National in Croix-des-Bouquets, after it had received an inquiry from the Guardian a few weeks earlier. The victims felt that Dadou had been given a tip-off. “They betrayed the victims to Dadou,” says one source who has worked extensively on the case. “After that, they could never really trust Fifa.” Fifa suspended Jean-Bart for six weeks after the Guardian’s first article in April. He was eventually banned for life by Fifa in December 2020 after being found guilty by Fifa’s ethics committee of having abused his position and sexually harassed and abused female players, including minors. The 74-year-old has consistently denied the claims and a June date has been set for his appeal hearing at the court of arbitration for sport. By the time Jean-Bart was banned as part of the Guardian’s investigation, Roseline and several other young female referees had already detailed the abuse they allegedly suffered at the hands of Grant. “I spent several years as a referee and it was a constant fight,” said one who did not want to be named. “When I was 17 years old, Grant tried to take my virginity. In exchange, he promised me so many things … That’s how they do it. They helped some girls in a way that they can’t speak out.” Roseline hoped that agreeing to give evidence to Fifa would not only ensure protection for her and her family but result in swift justice against her alleged abuser. She was mistaken. Grant was contacted at the end of August 2020 by Fifa’s ethics committee and asked to provide a written statement as part of their investigation, although he wasn’t provisionally suspended until January 2021. Five months later and still with no news, Roseline wrote to several senior Fifa officials including Mario Gallavotti, an Italian lawyer who was then its director of independent committees and responsible for Fifa’s independent ethics committee that investigates allegations of sexual abuse and other crimes by football officials. “I hereby inform Fifa of my serious concerns following a series of suspicious events relating to these testimonies,” she wrote. “Two days after my conversation with the members of the ad hoc panel, I received a call from Rosnick Grant, the person I had just testified against. During his call, Mr Grant intimidated me by clearly letting me know that he was aware of my testimony, although confidential, that I had just given. Mr Grant also told me he was untouchable. What especially frightened me the most was to learn, several months later, that my testimony was lost and was not found until February 2021.” An email from a senior member of the ethics committee on 10 February 2021 that has been seen by the Guardian confirms that it had now “found the declaration made on 6 October 2020” by Roseline and “where possible, we would also like to have an interview with her”. A Fifa spokesperson said: “Any reports that are submitted confidentially or received, including personal testimony, are usually acted upon or revisited at various stages of an investigation.” Roseline’s letter in May 2021 also raised serious concerns about an article that had been published that week on the internet with the headline, “Who are Dadou’s false witnesses?” which threatened to reveal her identity and where she was staying. “I have no connection in this locality which was chosen by mutual agreement for my protection,” she wrote. “And here we are in great danger now. Please do something. I am very afraid for my life and that of my family which are in your hands for the second time. Since last week, Rosnick Grant has kept calling me either to intimidate me or to ask me questions about my current situation. Thank you for your attention.” To her surprise, Gallavotti responded by WhatsApp: “We received your email, but I don’t understand why. No one has ‘lost’ your testimony, we are hiding it to protect you; no one told anyone about your testimony which was kept confidential. Your name was already in the media before you testified and that’s why you were bullied by Mr Rosnick. If we want to improve football in Haiti and help young Haitians in sport, everyone must work in the same direction. If you need support, it is better to contact the competetant [sic] department directly and not to 15 people, most of whom are not aware of a confidential file.” Asked whether this was a suitable response to an alleged victim of sexual abuse, a Fifa spokesperson said: “Mr Gallavotti has confirmed that it was recommended to the alleged victim that they should contact the relevant body investigating at the time in order to receive further support.” After originally being suspended in January, Grant was finally banned for life on 23 July 2021 having been found guilty by Fifa’s ethics committee of committing acts of sexual harassment and abuse, as well as coercing young referees “to prevent the reporting of such sexual abuse”. The previous month, he had been accused of trying to arrange the killing of a radio journalist who had been attempting to uncover alleged corruption at the FHF. Grant has denied the claims. Asked why the process of banning Grant took almost nine months after his original suspension, the Fifa spokesperson said: “For the investigative team in Haiti, the top priority has always been – and remains – the protection of victims, and they had for instance to intervene to provide support and protection to individuals that had been threatened. The proceeding was not slow, taking especially into account the travel restrictions due to Covid-19, several communication issues with the country, the hostility of the environment and above all the challenges in gathering evidence from victims and witnesses whilst ensuring their safety and care.” An investigation into allegations that the former FHF technical director Wilner Etienne raped several female players under the age of 18 remains open more than 15 months after he was suspended. A Fifa source said it has “no evidence” despite the testimonies of several alleged victims and witnesses. Etienne, who has denied wrongdoing and says the claims are a “pure lie”, was pictured at a charity match in November where he handed out medals. “We can confirm that all evidence and testimony received by the investigatory chamber of the independent Fifa ethics committee was handled with the greatest of care and in the strictest of confidence,” said the Fifa spokesperson. But Roseline believes they have not gone far enough. “I hoped Fifa will clean our mess because we don’t have justice there,” she says. “The worst thing is that I love football so much. Sometimes I believe it’s better I turn away from it. I lost my dreams, my hopes.” In the same month that Roseline and Muzwudzani had made contact with world football’s governing body to report their cases, Infantino appeared to be tackling the issue of sexual abuse head on. “It is a topic we have been hiding for too long and it is time to start opening it,” announced the Fifa president in September 2020. A new partnership with the United Nations office on drugs and crime included a pledge by Infantino to establish “an independent, multisports, multi-agency international entity” to investigate abuse cases. “What I am proposing is to study together the creation of an independent agency, some sort of a mix between sports bodies, institutional, governmental, international organisations, who can help our children who want to play sport to be and to move in a safe environment,” he said. A year-long consultation process described by a Fifa source as “one of the most robust there’s ever been in sport” resulted in the final report being sent to stakeholders at the end of November 2021. It refers to “the challenging learnings of complex, devastating and serious sexual abuses in Afghanistan and Haitian football”. Gallavotti, who previously worked for Infantino during his time at Uefa, stepped down as director of independent committees in June 2021 to be replaced by Carlos Schneider. The safe sport entity’s final report praises his “legal wisdom and practical advice” in “defining an entity that may function for the benefit of all sports and help sports judicial bodies appropriately address harassment and abuse”. “The idea is the formation of a foundation that will be endowed with independent governance,” said Gallavotti on the Italian podcast No Coach: storie di abusi nello sport (stories of abuse in sport). “You don’t have to put the dust under the carpet. We need to talk about it.” The evidence of the past four years, however, is that in many cases Fifa has appeared reluctant to do so. In Mongolia, the youth coach Uchralsaikhan Buuveibaatar was accused of physically and sexually abusing young players from the girls’ under-15 team in August 2019, although it is understood he continued to work for the Mongolian Football Federation until the end of November. The MFF’s disciplinary body, which reported the matter three months later to the Asian Football Confederation, said that Buuveibaatar, who has denied committing “sexual crimes”, was first suspended from all football-related activities in August 2019. The AFC told the Guardian that Buuveibaatar’s “sanction was extended worldwide by Fifa in August 2021”. Fifa did not publicly announce the ban at the time. That case was not the first to raise concerns at the international players’ union, Fifpro. It is understood that there have been serious doubts over the effectiveness of Fifa’s investigation into widespread sexual abuse allegations in Gabon that were reported by the Guardian at the end of 2021. The ethics committee confirmed on 10 January that it had opened a case, nearly a month after the first story alleging the former coach of Gabon’s under-17s had been accused of raping, grooming and exploiting young players was published. Patrick Assoumou Eyi, known as “Capello”, and two other youth coaches are facing up to 30 years in prison each if found guilty of charges including raping minors, sexual assault and endangering the life of another, with the Gabonese government having launched an investigation into widespread sexual abuse in the country as a result. Meanwhile, Serge Mombo, a leading football official who also served as Gabon’s kitman at the Africa Cup of Nations, was arrested last month after being accused of sexually abusing young players and demanding sex as a condition of them securing places in national teams. Both have denied the abuse claims, made by alleged victims and witnesses to the Guardian. Fifpro has written to Fifa regarding its concerns that the investigation, which is being handled by the Gabonese Football Association (Fegafoot), has a conflict of interest. “At least two of those arrested were employed by Fegafoot and closely connected to powerful people in Gabonese football,” Fifpro told BBC Sport Africa. “Fegafoot is not fit for purpose to investigate such serious allegations.” A Fifa spokesperson said: “Fifa can confirm that the matter is being handled in line with Fifa’s code of ethics. Furthermore, Fifa is in contact with Fegafoot as well as Fifpro, on the matter. Since the matter is ongoing, including criminal charges having been made in Gabon, please understand that no further comment can be made by Fifa at this stage.” Meanwhile the Gabonese players’ union has said that entrusting the federation with the investigation “when Fegafoot is at the centre of this affair in view of the revelations and its complicit silence proves that Fifa has not cared about all the victims of this abuse for all these decades”. Fegafoot’s spokesperson, Pablo Moussodji Ngoma, told the BBC that Fegafoot itself “is also a victim” and said that its ethics committee would conduct an independent investigation. Lindsey tells the Guardian: “Every single case I’ve heard has been almost identical, but when you try and structure the system from the top down it doesn’t work.” Concerns have also been raised about the restrictions in Fifa’s own guidelines that state cases cannot be prosecuted more than 10 years after they occurred – a regulation that is believed to now be under review. Neither Saima nor Farzana were part of the consultation process for the safe sport entity, which could be established in the next few months after the first meeting of its secretariat is understood to have been held last month. A Fifa spokesperson said it had “followed best practice throughout in consulting with voices of experience to ensure their meaningful involvement and to minimise retraumatisation”. But Saima insists that they should have been consulted. “They’ve not asked our opinions,” she says. “The way that they dealt with our case was not professional – and they didn’t listen to our voices.” Additional reporting by Alex Cizmic",Sport/Football,"The world’s game, a global scandal: the struggle to be heard in football’s sexual abuse crisis",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/04/football-sexual-abuse-crisis-global-scandal-special-report
3/5/2022,"When I looked out my window in the early hours of Monday morning and saw my neighbour wading through water I was entering an alternative reality. The kind of parallel universe you might not come back from. “There is a storm about to arrive,” said the man in the IGA, “unlike anything we have seen so far”. And we had been seeing storms most days since last September. It wasn’t a malignant storm, full of malicious wind of the kind that tore a chunk off my roof in December. It was quite polite really, but insistent, there was just so much water coming down. And still it kept coming and coming. For all its lack of ferocity this storm would cause the biggest flood in local recorded history. By mid-morning my street was a river, and the town of Murwillumbah was underwater. Sitting in the wide flat Tweed Valley in northern New South Wales, surrounded by mountain ranges, it is a spectacularly pretty place. Through the town runs the usually benign, sometimes glassily still Tweed River. But on Sunday night the river was rising and surging. Mark Hamilton-Browne opened his front door at midnight only to find “the whole street was about three foot deep and it was flowing over the bonnet and windscreen of my car. Two hours earlier there was nothing there.” He managed to attract the attention of an SES boat. Getting to the boat, he says, “I was up to my stomach, almost up to my chest”. Wet and shocked, he was taken to the evacuation centre at the Tafe. “There were probably 300 people there and 30 or more dogs. And some dogs barked all night. People were wired on adrenaline, anxiety, fear and stress and everyone was talking really loud. It was just a cacophony of upset people. I didn’t sleep at all.” In the days to follow more than 600 people would be brought to the evacuation centre at nearly Kingscliff. “Hearing the stories is just tragic,” says the federal member for Richmond, Justine Elliot. Through the night came the distress calls: 30 dogs, three cats and two goats at the pound in rising water (rescued by boat), 44 patients with no running water in aged care, disabled person with a dog and a cat in Charles Street, helicopter needed for four adults and four children, families trapped all along Tweed Valley Way, a pregnant woman trapped in a ceiling. On and on it went. Locals in boats and on jetskis helping them to safety. During the night Hamilton-Browne’s house was completely destroyed. Water smashed through the front windows and took the door off. The force of the water moved the furniture and tipped over the fridge. Books turned to mush. He has lost everything. In the days that followed, “the reality of it sunk in, the shock turned into despair and grief. I am pretty distraught.” It is the same story in street after street, house after house, as people return to ruined homes that were above the flood line and had never flooded before. For kilometres along Tweed Valley Way there is utter devastation. Heading into the nearby town of Condong it is apocalyptic in the mud. A disaster on a massive scale. Murwillumbah is still scarred from the 2017 flood that was supposed to be an unprecedented once-in-a-century event. It would, people believed, never happen again in their lifetime. In that flood the heavy rain that followed Cyclone Debbie had turned the river into a tsunami. “We heard a roar, a weird noise that sounded like traffic. It just got louder and louder and a wall of water hit our house” said Trace Henderson at the time. She ended up with “trees in our lounge room, other people’s belongings, cushions, a microwave. A couch in the garden, pallets of wood.” At least 300 people were left displaced, homeless. It took years to recover. This week’s storm was worse. “It was much faster and much higher,” says local councillor Meredith Dennis, “and it is not draining away as fast as it normally would. There is just all this stinking mud. The damage to the infrastructure this time is so much worse – whole bridges have completely gone. There are lots of landslides and road damage that won’t be fixed for months and months.” From Monday on, Murwillumbah has been an island. All roads in and out are flooded and closed. No supply trucks can come in. When Optus and the NBN tower go down we enter a kind of twilight zone, isolated, in another world that seems to be moving in slow motion, unable to communicate. Anxiety peaks for those with homes and families out in the hills that they can’t reach, a need to access disaster grants in order to eat. Like so many, Angela James, a disability carer looking after her patients in town, doesn’t know what has happened to her husband, son or elderly parents in the village of Pumpenbil, just that they will be flooded in. Says mayor Chris Cherry: “We still don’t know the extent of the damage in villages and isolated places that you just can’t get to.” Those who have lost everything for a second time are, she says, “just broken”. All five petrol stations have gone under. I am rationing the small amount I have and just walking everywhere in the rain. The things that concerned me last week seem ridiculously redundant now. Now it is basic survival. As shell-shocked people wander around town carrying backpacks with all they have left, their homes gone, living out of suitcases in their cars, with nowhere to go, shops and restaurant owners grimly sweep out their destroyed premises, throwing everything into the street. Sewage has backed up in the gelato shop, there is a stench of rotten fish from the Japanese restaurant, mould and mud are taking hold. In the arts centre, which has been under waist-high water for days, paintings by Arna Baartz are sitting in a skip, the irreplaceable work of other artists lumped into the middle of the room. A tree and landslide has swept through the palliative care op-shop. Now everything is out in the street being given away to those who have lost everything. Elaine who works there broke her wrist during evacuation but can’t get to Tweed hospital to get it set. The painkillers are not working. When the NBN went, so did card payments, now it is cash only. All the ATMs went under except one where there are long queues. The only food shop left operating is a small IGA, which is rapidly running out of supplies. It is starting to feel like a subtropical Soviet Russia – queuing for an hour and a half for a loaf of bread only to find there is none left. By Wednesday, the shelves are nearly bare. “If I can’t have bread or milk,” says a woman in the Imperial pub, “I might as well have wine.” In Australia we take so many things for granted. When it resumes raining there is the realisation that if the waters don’t recede and the roads don’t open, and supply trucks come through, we could run out of food. The water treatment plant is still not up and running, it’s boiled and bottled water now. There is exhaustion borne of lack of sleep, of not knowing where to start when they go back to houses without water or electricity. Sifting through all the precious things that they worked so hard to get to see what can be salvaged. Trying to find the energy to start again from nothing. Flood insurance is beyond the financial reach of most people. There are piles of belongings that are debris now along nearly every road. Some people have lost their business in town as well as their homes. It will take months for the full scale of this disaster to unfold, to understand how many people have been displaced, how many homes destroyed. On Friday afternoon, the military was due to be deployed to assist. Elliott says: “We need to get provisions to people, food, water, shelter. And in the long term we need a lot of financial support for the recovery. It is going to have a huge long-term impact.” It feels like something has changed and shifted. When we return to normal that it won’t be the same again. The country community of Murwillumbah pulled together magnificently in 2017. And they are doing it again; donating food, clothes, forming groups to clean houses, volunteering. The offers of help just keeping coming and coming. Because what remains in this shattered community when so much is lost, is love.",News/Australia news,How the floods turned Murwillumbah into a shell-shocked island struggling for ‘basic survival’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/05/how-the-floods-turned-murwillumbah-into-a-shell-shocked-island-struggling-for-basic-survival
3/5/2022,"On Tuesday, before confirmation of a Covid infection sent Scott Morrison into isolation, the prime minister spoke about democratic values. “My government will never be backward when it comes to standing up for Australia’s national interests and standing up for liberal democracy in today’s world, which is demarcating between autocrats and authoritarian regimes, invading and seeking to coerce liberal democratic regimes,” Morrison told reporters in his courtyard. “We can’t be absent when it comes to standing up for those important principles.” Joe Biden used similar language in his State of the Union address on Wednesday. Biden declared democracies were “rising to the moment” in an epochal battle between autocrats and democrats. This morale boosting, band-of-brothers sentiment (ever so briefly) quelled America’s polarised derangements. Forceful assertion of liberal democratic values is a common theme around the western world at the moment, for obvious and entirely valid reasons. The democratic world is rallying to match the moral and material courage of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is resisting the territorial aggression of Vladimir Putin. But this inexorable triumph of democratic liberalism over autocracy narrative misses some important nuances. The first is the resurgence of autocratic regimes hasn’t occurred in a vacuum. Autocracy has staged a comeback for a range of reasons. Sadly, one of them is democracy doesn’t always deliver for people, because leaders don’t always discharge their responsibilities with the welfare of citizens front of mind. Democracy becomes fragile and eventually, imperilled, when politicians lose their way, and people lose faith that the system is serving their interests. As a proof point, we need only ask the citizens of the US who willingly elected Donald Trump – a post-truth proto-fascist – to “drain the swamp”. The other point to be very clear about is democracies are not defended by rousing rhetoric. They are defended by actions. Democracies are defended by leaders who regard themselves as the custodians of powerful customs and values. So Morrison can be as Churchillian as he likes in his courtyard on a Tuesday morning, but people will judge the prime minister by what he does. Standing up for liberal democracy in today’s world isn’t a soundbite, it’s a calling. It’s a substantive task that starts at home. This weighty responsibility doesn’t require the convenient counterpoint of an autocrat with sharp elbows in Moscow or Beijing to make it true, or urgent or pressing. Maintaining the institutional foundations of democracy is core business for any prime minister worthy of the title. It’s also an objective test that a prime minister either passes or fails. So let’s nominate some ways Australia’s prime minister could actually rise to the occasion. The prime minister could start by delivering the federal anti-corruption body he promised to deliver years ago. Morrison once described an integrity commission as a “fringe issue”. It isn’t. It’s something very tangible – foundational even. A credible federal anti-corruption body, which imposes a culture of consequences on the most powerful people in the country, gives citizens a level of trust that there isn’t one rule for the political class and another rule for them. Morrison could also value the parliament and the deliberative processes he spends a lot of time maligning as “bubble stuff”. In more than 20 years of reporting from Canberra, I’ve never seen a prime minister less interested in the foundational processes of Australia’s democratic system than the current incumbent. Morrison sees these things as constraints. He chafes against them.

Morrison could also choose to take accountability seriously. He could be accountable himself, and require his ministers to be accountable. The prime minister doesn’t have to wait for the Australian National Audit Office to savage the government about the latest outrage. He could spare himself the inevitable savaging, and the months of refusing to accept responsibility for whatever the latest atrocity is, by choosing not to preside over atrocities. Morrison could also value bipartisanship when those moments present. During the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, the prime minister experimented with the idea he could be a “big tent” leader – a person capable of working constructively with his political opponents and uniting a country. Those were Morrison’s best months in the prime ministership. Voters rewarded him with high approval ratings. A number of surveys also tracked a return of institutional trust. But more recently, Morrison’s partisan recklessness – the apotheosis being branding one of his political opponents a Manchurian candidate because he hoped a scratch McCarthyist show trial in the House of Representatives might serve his immediate political interests – has been worrying enough to provoke a rare public rebuke from Canberra’s national security establishment. Finally, the prime minister could also end his flirtation with alternative facts. Verifiable facts aren’t abstract concepts. They actually glue liberal democracies together. They create safe zones for productive resolution of conflict. They create a shared foundation for collective action in the national interest. Let’s take just one practical example. In Australia, we now live on the frontline of the climate crisis. That’s a fact. And the prime minister continues to pretend that the Coalition’s climate policy is adequate to the task of managing risk. This pretence is offensive at the best of times, but it’s even more offensive when Australians are battling the latest harbinger of heating – the extreme weather currently battering the east coast of Australia. Morrison likes to style himself as a prime minister who takes national security seriously. He’s the prime minister protecting Australians from coercion and foreign interference. But climate change is also a pressing security issue. Managing the risk of climate change is fundamentally about protecting people from existential harm while creating opportunity in the transition, and the Coalition has done everything it can over the past decade to comprehensively fail the citizenry on this issue. This week, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tried again to warn people about what is coming. Australia, it said, can expect “further warming and sea level rise, with more hot days and heatwaves, less snow, more rainfall in the north, less April-October rainfall in the south-west and south-east, more extreme fire weather days in the south and east”. As flood waters surged in south-east Queensland and down the coast of New South Wales, the IPCC noted the socio-economic costs arising from climate variability and change were continuing to increase. “Extreme heat has led to excess deaths and increased rates of many illnesses”. It said nuisance and “extreme coastal flooding” had increased due to sea level rise, high tides and storm surges. The latest report warned of “cascading, compounding and aggregate impacts on cities, settlements, infrastructure, supply-chains and services due to wildfires, floods, droughts, heatwaves, storms and sea level rise”. Obviously the failure to confront these realities is a global one. But Australia, under the Coalition Morrison leads, has spent the past decade actively contributing to that global failure. The IPCC’s prognosis reads like an abject failure of democracy – the triumph of powerful sectional interests over the interests of people. It reads like victory for the vacuous ranters of the culture wars at the expense of ordinary people who can’t insure their homes. Morrison would be well advised to keep these measurable failures in mind when he styles himself as democracy’s champion.",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison has a lot to say about democratic values. Here’s how he could actually enact them | Katharine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/05/scott-morrison-has-a-lot-to-say-about-democratic-values-heres-how-he-could-actually-enact-them
3/5/2022,"Once the waters recede it’s the smell that hits you: an unmistakable, miserable earthy stench that is impossible to forget once it has invaded your nostrils. Brisbane resident Rachael Roberts has been through floods twice, first in 2011 and now in 2022. “The smell – oh my god – it’s putrid,” she says. “It’s this dank smell like clothes that have gotten wet and haven’t dried properly and another layer of something like sewage – it’s stuck on everything and you can’t escape it.” That smell is going to sear in the consciousness of thousands of south-east Queensland and NSW residents as they return to their flooded homes for a long and difficult clean up process over the next days and weeks. Combined with the sight of your flooded home, it can be an overwhelming experience. Here, experts and people with experience of flooding share their suggestions for how to make the process as safe and smooth as possible. It may take several weeks before you are able to safely return to your home, but aid is available long before that. Deb Conradsen, whose rented house in Brisbane’s Yeronga was flooded to the eaves in 2011, said a lot of help came to her because her family had registered at an evacuation centre. “They take your name and address down and they know what you need and how badly you’ve been flooded.” She was offered vouchers from the Salvation Army and the children’s school gave the family free uniforms. “At work they collected money and gave me gift vouchers to replace stuff. People started a list, ‘What Deb needs.’ Work just rallied around and gave us stuff like a dining room table. That was really helpful.” Australian Red Cross national resilience adviser John Richardson said that rather than just braving it out, “recognise that it is traumatic and stressful”. “This is a big major life event. Tell people – tell school, your workplace and hopefully they’re both supportive. Be proactive – go to your employer and tell them you’ll need time to sort it out. I’ve heard of people who’ve used up sick leave and annual leave and it was really hard. Use the financial assistance the government’s made available.” If you have insurance, you should contact your insurer as soon as possible too, advises Prof Paula Jarzabkowski, who specialises in disaster recovery at the University of Queensland Business School. “Let them know there’s been a flood situation and you’re likely to make a claim. That’s going to make it quicker when you do make a claim.” “You might think, ‘Oh my god all my files are wet’, but if you can remember who your insurance company was, they’ll have all that on company records, and you just give them your address and name.” Jarzabkowski says it is important to ask your insurer what you’re eligible for, as some policies provide for emergency accommodation or clothing: “It may even provide for certain temporary things like toiletries and food spoilage.” The Insurance Council of Australia says insurers may be able to organise emergency repairs to roofs “to minimise any hazards and prevent further damage.” They can help by “isolating damaged solar panels or electrical circuits and installing a roof tarp.” You may also be able to apply for urgent financial assistance. Joining your local Facebook community group can also be useful, and many local councillors and MPs are putting together databases to match volunteers with those who need help, so it is worth reaching out to your local representatives. Applying for financial assistance can be daunting, especially if you have lost your identity documents. Evacuation centres can help you with the process, and may be able to connect you with charitable aid. The federal government has made several forms of disaster relief payment available through Services Australia (phone: 180 22 66). These include a Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP) of $1000 for an adult and $400 per child, and a Disaster Recovery Allowance of up to 13 weeks’ income assistance. In Queensland the Emergency Hardship Assistance Grant is only available for seven days after the grant is activated in an affected area. Eligible applicants may receive $180 per person up to $900 for a family of five or more. Call 1800 173 349. The New South Wales government offers a Disaster Relief Grant for low-income earners whose home has been damaged by a natural disaster and who don’t have insurance. Call 13 77 88.

Community centres and places of worship can often help with food, shelter and sourcing volunteers. If you are having difficulty with your bank or insurer, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority can help with disputes. John Richardson of the Red Cross says residents need to gird themselves, both physically and emotionally. “Start preparing yourself to make that trip home. There’s a practical side: make sure you have sensible clothes – boots and long pants and long-sleeved shirts – protective equipment [gloves, masks and glasses], take a torch, make sure you have water and food, a full tank of petrol and mobile phones charged. The other side is preparing your mind for what you might encounter.” “You’ll be confronted and it can be quite emotional and that’s OK,” he says. Richardson has seen the aftermath of countless floods and says it assaults all the senses: “There will be smells and sights – flood waters are pretty icky and there’s a lot of sediment in them and there can be faeces and sewerage and that can make things really smelly. The visuals – it will be very brown. “In Queensland and New South Wales the humidity means if the house has been closed it can be quite oppressive. Mould can be there: you’ll see it in furnishings and curtains. There will be a watermark if water’s got into your house … There might be dead animals.” “We’re connected to homes and what’s in it. Allow yourself to be emotional. If you think, ‘I can’t do this today’ that’s OK as well,” he says.

More information is available here. Do not enter a flooded home until you are certain it is safe to do so. “It’s like doing first aid: you have to assess the situation and make sure it’s safe for you before you help anyone else,” said Master Builders building services manager Tony Mitchell. Although it may delay access to your home, Mitchell suggests you get licensed contractors to check your electricity, gas, sewerage and water. “If the home is subsiding and collapsing, [the homeowner] should be engaging a structural engineer to make an assessment of whether they should even be going inside, and if it can be fixed,” he says. If you have insurance, Mitchell suggests contacting your insurer and waiting for their instructions before attempting any clean up. Mitchell says the same cautions apply for both residents and clean up volunteers. In 2011, Brisbane’s Mud Army mobilised quickly and organically after the floods, but this raised serious concerns for Mitchell. “Has someone checked the electricity? It’s nice to have community conscience, but in 2011 they stuffed it up when they simply turned up with buckets and rakes and shovels … it’s lucky no one was killed.” With many houses now fitted with solar panels the risks are even greater. Mitchell said that a house could still be live, even if the power to the neighbourhood was cut, or mains power was switched off. “Check the electrical, especially with solar panels. The size of those things, and especially if they have battery storage on site, they could be dangerous with energised electrical circuits throughout the dwelling, and dangerous gases.” Other hazards to be aware of include asbestos: “Anything built pre-1980 potentially has asbestos somewhere throughout the home,” Mitchell says. “You can find it in lino, old meter boxes, and floor coverings, wall linings and ceilings.” Once you have confirmed it is safe to enter your home, Jarzabkowski says it is important to photograph everything before moving it, especially if you have insurance. “If you don’t have a phone, get a volunteer to help you get a bunch of photos, because it will make it so much easier for the insurance company if they can clearly see what’s happened and that the damage you’re claiming is real. “It’s a very emotional process,” she says. “It can feel like they’re hostile to you or they don’t believe you, but that’s not the case: they’re just doing the right thing and checking that you did have that [item you are claiming].” Collect as much detail as possible, including photos from several angles, and showing the whole furniture piece, rather than just the damaged section. “If it’s carpet or a lounge, keep a sample of the material to show them,” Jarzabkowski says. “As you’re throwing it out, jot down somewhere as much info as you have – ‘it was a three-seater sofa that I bought from Ikea in 2019’. If you can’t remember precisely, just put down roughly what you can.” She suggests recording serial numbers where possible and taking photos of the general damage to the home as well as specific items. Jarzabkowski suggests enlisting volunteers to help you record your losses, especially if you’re finding it hard emotionally. “Some people might not be physically strong enough to haul out a sofa, but they might be able to write down information in a sympathetic way and be helpful.” Taking time to listen to the owner’s wishes is one of the best ways clean-up volunteers can help. “When people are given some choice over what happens to their things, even if it takes a little bit longer, it is a really good part of the emotional healing.” In rental properties, it is the owner’s responsibility to organise and pay for cleaning and repair, but the tenant needs to look after their own furniture and possessions. Renters are eligible for a rent waiver if they can’t live in the property, or a rent decrease if it is damaged. Tenants Queensland CEO, Penny Carr, says: “The best advice for anyone is to take evidence, put things in writing and be clear about what you want.” “If it’s about a rent decrease, you need to be clear about the loss of amenity. That is, when you can’t use everything you’re paying for in your rent, including rooms that are out of action, the back yard or supplied furniture … It’s fine to do things verbally, but always follow up in writing and keep evidence.” “Take photos of the roof leak or take photos of the damaged bathroom.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning For rent decrease requests, she suggests specifying “how much, when it starts, when it ends, and if the end is not clear, specify an event like ‘when the bathroom is fully functional’. Also be clear about when you want the landlord to respond to you”. If your landlord disagrees, contact your tenancy advice service: Tenants Queensland or the Tenants Union of NSW. You can also take the matter to the administrative tribunal in your state: QCAT or NSWCAT. Tenants Queensland has a useful fact sheet for tenants affected by floods and storms, including a draft letter you can use to apply for a rent decrease. Carr said the regular rules applied to entry – landlords still have to give tenants notice before entering the dwelling. “We have had a few calls when the owner or real estate agent has just lobbed in and that’s just not on. People are already feeling violated by the floods and losing their goods and they feel outraged that someone is in their home.” This happened to Deb Conradsen in 2011. She returned to find “the owner came in before we could come back … and he threw out whatever was left in the house. Everything was on the pavement except what we’d locked in the cupboards. He’d started ripping all the walls off.” Family heirlooms she could have saved were looted from the footpath. Carr says: “it’s not for the owner to decide what’s done with furniture that doesn’t belong to them. They can’t just turn up to do repairs. They still have to give 24 hours notice.” Rachael Roberts, who has seen floods sweep through the lower level of her homes in West End in 2011 and this year in Yeronga, said: “I think seeing all your stuff ruined is overwhelming and you don’t know where to start and what to do and trying to figure out what needs to be saved.” Her solution was to work with a team of friends and neighbourhood volunteers to make separate piles for rubbish, things that needed more thought, and things to be salvaged. Don’t be tempted to leave anything you want to keep on the lawn, she says. After the downstairs area was high-pressure cleaned, Roberts says, “everyone in our street came out and helped us put all the stuff that we potentially wanted to save back in under the house overnight”. “I was surprised, but some of our neighbours were saying that there’s quite a lot of people who will come around and take stuff.” River mud, though potentially contaminated with sewage, can be washed off crockery, glass, plastic, cutlery, solid wood and clothes. The Insurance Council of Australia advises, “do not throw out goods that can be salvaged or repaired”. With no insurance, Conradsen lost almost everything, but she is still grateful for the household items she was able to save. “We’d tied up all our cupboards hoping we could come back for our plates and things because you can wash them off … I still have those pots and plates.” You’re going to have to deal with mould, which can pose a health risk if you suffer from asthma, lung disease, or have low immunity. Queensland Health’s dealing with mould fact sheet outlines how to safely clean mould off surfaces. Wear protective clothing, including long-sleeved shirts and pants, sturdy boots, gloves and eye protection. Wash your hands with soap before touching your face, eating, drinking or smoking: sanitiser isn’t enough, so keep some soap and clean water handy. Clean, treat and cover any cuts immediately. Flood water and mud is full of pathogens as well as industrial, medical and chemical waste. Wear sunscreen and mosquito repellent, wear a hat and drink lots of water. If you’re living in your house while cleaning a flood-affected lower level or yard, remember that you’re potentially tramping faecal matter inside, so take shoes off and wash floors frequently. Richardson, of the Red Cross says you must throw out all food, beverages and medicine exposed to water and mud, including canned goods and containers with food or liquid that have been sealed shut: “When in doubt, throw it out”. Queensland Health says drying things out as quickly as possible is key to preventing mould, and if you can’t dry an item out in two days, it needs to be thrown out. This includes mattresses, couches and insulation. Water damaged goods like saturated carpets and soft furnishings can pose health risks if left in the home, so the Insurance Council of Australia recommends these be removed from the home and disposed of as soon as possible. Giddens Furniture Restoration owner Bruce Hawkesford says that while some furniture can be salvaged: “I wouldn’t bother with things like radiata pine, which is a cheap, fast-growing timber. All chipboard furniture is not repairable.” Do check drawers before throwing out furniture. In the 2011 Brisbane floods people lost jewellery and documents that had been stored, and sometimes even taped in unlikely places. Richardson says appliances need to be checked by a professional to make sure they are safe to use, and warns that fridges and freezers have “foam insulation and sealed components that may be water damaged. They should be emptied, cleaned, disinfected and checked by a professional or replaced.” “If you receive advice that an expensive appliance should be replaced, get this in writing and discuss it with your insurance assessor before you buy another one,” he said. When placing destroyed items on the kerb, Brisbane resident Jonathan Klupp – who went through flooding in 2011 suggests: “Put an old towel or rug or cardboard under the junk pile on the footpath – it captures any broken plastic or glass.” Red Cross Australia has excellent tips for cleaning up after a flood. Crockery and pots: Conradsen says that she used a three tub system to wash her plates and crockery after the 2011 flood. “The first was a mud wash and the next was soap and water and the third was antiseptic.” Richardson says washing water must be clean, and you should air dry dishes rather than using a tea towel. Furniture: Conradsen’s tip is to wash the mud off while still wet if possible. “The mud cakes and if you don’t get it off immediately it’s had it. I have some furniture that we got out – we cleaned them and [pressure washed] them, but 10 years later you can still see it.” Furniture restorer Hawkesford says that, “anything made from quality solid timber can be restored”. That includes anything made of Australian hardwoods and silky oak. “English oak doesn’t mind water – they built ships out of it.” “Just give it a good hose and then leave it somewhere well ventilated,” he says. “It should be dried without heat, so don’t leave it in the sun, but somewhere well ventilated with a cold fan blowing over it is fine. Heat will damage the furniture, as it expands the water in the timber itself. Once it’s clean and dry, follow up with a restorer.” Hawkesford said insured owners who really wanted to restore furniture might need to insist the piece had sentimental value or was a family heirloom: “Because the cost of restoration has increased, the insurance companies are hoping the customer will take a settlement and buy something new. They don’t want it hanging around on their books for 12 months.” But if you care about a piece, it is worth trying to save it. “I knew a piano technician who picked up a grand piano from the side of the road in 2011 and restored it.” Appliances: If an electrician says they are safe to salvage, the Red Cross recommends you: “Clean and disinfect dishwashers, washing machines and dryers only with water that has been declared safe for drinking.” Books and photographs: Conservation experts from the State Library of Queensland have useful advice for salvaging damaged collections of books, photographs or artworks. Their main tip is that it’s important to attend to damage as soon as possible, to prevent it becoming permanent. Clothes and towels: You can wash dirty cloth nappies, so it is possible to wash most clothes and bedding. This is a great job for a volunteer, who can wash your clothes on a hot cycle (over 60 degrees) with clean water. Remove as much mud as possible before you put fabric in the washing machine and add bleach or, for sensitive fabrics, a commercial sanitising cleaner. If you are doing the laundry at your own home, Richardson says: “If the water is safe to drink and the sewer line or septic tank works, run the washing machine through one full cycle using hot water and a disinfectant or sanitiser before you wash.” Soft furnishings: Emergency Management Australia says “feather and foam rubber pillows may be washed but those stuffed with kapok or cotton may not”. Dry cleaning may be an option for expensive curtains: dry them out to prevent mildew and shake out as much mud as possible before taking them to the dry cleaner. Hawkesford said most modern upholstered furniture will have to be thrown out “because it has been built on such cheap frames” and isn’t worth restoring. Interiors: If you live in a Queenslander, Mitchell says the interior clean up can be simple. “If it’s a true old Queenslander with VJ timber walls you can just hose them out. The casement windows get a bit wobbly, the doors jam, but they’re sturdy.” Newer houses are likely to have plaster or fibre-board sheeting that “don’t survive very well”. How much needs to be ripped out depends on the water level: “In Mackay in 2008 a lot of the houses were wet only to 1m, so they ripped out the bottom layer and dried it out and they’ve performed adequately since then.” Mitchell says to check for asbestos before ripping out any walls. Gardens and lawns: Klupp says, “in 2011 we had a lot of plants die then rot, adding to the smell”. He suggests you “give your garden and grass a quick hose to get the black mud off.”",News/Australia news,"Australian post-flood recovery: where to get help, how to return home safely and what to salvage",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/05/australian-post-flood-recovery-where-to-get-help-how-to-return-home-safely-and-what-to-salvage
3/5/2022,"As a young girl Lauren Burns told a friend that if they climbed high enough and jumped, they’d be able to fly. When their experiment failed, her friend protested that it didn’t work. “It didn’t work … this time,” Burns corrected her. Burns has been questing at the forefront of flight ever since. When she was 14 her father drove her to Essendon airport for her first flight. Two years later she made her first solo flight, before she could drive a car. She wanted to be an astronaut, the first person on Mars. She was a star aeronautical engineering student at RMIT when, at 21, her mother sat her down to break some news that would send her on another quest entirely: into the inner space of her own cells and the missing genetic information they contained. Her mother told her she’d been conceived via a donor. The man she called “dad”, who’d trained her to be a star athlete and given her flying lessons, was not her biological father. Utterly stunned, Burns could not process the news. “It had wounded me in a place I couldn’t locate,” she writes in Triple Helix, her memoir, published this week. “Stuck between a shattered old and undefined new reality, daily life felt like watching a movie on a screen.” In the 16 years since that moment, Burns has been fighting for the rights of donor-conceived children while searching for her own biological truth. Along the way the aeronautical engineer gave up on Mars but instead now lives on the south coast of Victoria with her partner Gerry and their 10-month-old daughter, working remotely for a Swedish company intent on building the first electric aircraft. Writing her book has been instrumental to her quest for identity: “I wanted to go deep into the complexities. Why did I need to know who my father was? This was the question I kept getting asked in all my advocacy. I have a unique perspective on donor conception. I wanted to flip the script from parent to donor-conceived child.” She succeeds. In Triple Helix, Burns writes her experience as a donor-conceived person, supplanting the old narrative from the parents’ point of view, which ends happily ever after with the new parents holding their “miracle baby”. That first generation of donor-conceived babies are now adults and they’re speaking out, calling for recognition and a child-centred paradigm. Following her mother’s shock announcement, Burns was determined to discover the identity of her anonymous sperm donor. She spent the next four years battling the medical, legal and political establishments that kept him hidden. In 1988, Victoria had passed world-first legislation allowing donor-conceived people to apply for information about their donors. But the legislation only applied to children conceived after 1988. This excluded Burns. Nevertheless, she went searching for her biological father, and she found herself up against an establishment of male doctors, lawyers and politicians. Undaunted, she conducted her investigation with the sleuthing skill of a crack detective and the protean talent of an actor, switching from avenger to demure young woman depending on her opponent. After four years she discovered that the key to her genetic inheritance was held by one man and his conscience, David de Kretser, the new governor of Victoria. Seeing de Kretser on television had jolted her mother’s memory: she recognised him as her treating doctor for Lauren’s conception. It was her last shot; Burns appealed to de Kretser to contact her donor father on her behalf. Fortunately for Burns, de Kretser complied. In August 2009 Lauren received a letter from her biological father, Benedict Manning Clark, youngest child of acclaimed historian Manning Clark and linguist Dymphna Clark. “It was a fascinating but not always easy experience,” she says. “Like finding a mirror for many of my looks, personality traits and interests, triggering a paradoxical sense of connection and disconnection.” Discovering the identity of her biological father was a great joy – and a new emotional minefield. Her book gave her the space to explore this emotional terrain and the evolution of her journey. “Who is the ‘real’ father? I wanted to crack the binary of biological and social father and show it’s a continuum.” Burns had no words to express her radically isolating emotional tumult – until she met Narelle Grech, a donor-conceived woman who became her mentor and ally. “My political advocacy began aged 24 through my experiences dealing with so many old white men. It was hard to connect with them and activate their empathy. Why were architects of this system all men? I felt a huge sense of powerlessness and burning inner rage. Why is it this way? Until someone can describe it in words, it was hard to know why I was so angry. Questions I didn’t even dare to ask myself Narelle put words to.” Grech introduced Burns to TangledWebs, an advocacy group for donor-conceived people and Burns joined the battle to overturn the 1988 law that withheld donor information from donor-conceived people born before 1988, like Grech and herself. Her fight was fuelled by Grech’s death in 2013 from genetically-inherited bowel cancer, just six weeks after meeting her biological father who carried the recessive gene. In 2016 the Victorian parliament finally passed legislation to allow all donor-conceived people access to information about their donor parents. They called it “Narelle’s Law”. Exhausted after her arduous 12-year battle, Lauren took a holiday with Gerry in Kakadu. They knew something had to give when she climbed a plateau and screamed “FUCK!” into the void. “I swore a torrent of rage into the abyss. It was very cathartic,” she laughs down the phone. They decided to leave their jobs and travel around the United States in a campervan for nine months. “That time enabled me to process and digest in order to write the book. It allowed me to build my awareness, slow down and become really aware of the moment. And it reawakened my love of writing which had been dormant for 15 years.” Burns weaves this trip into her memoir, inspired by Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, which mixed “heavy investigative sections with meditative and contemplative sections”. The rivers, canyons and mountains they traverse provide rich material for her to evoke the absences and complexities of her experience: The landscape thrummed with strange new possibilities as the canyons branched in fractal patterns, like the structure of some giant brain. The architect of this immense splendour was the humble raindrop and I was struck by the irony that the desert is most shaped by the thing it lacks – water. Much of my life had been shaped by what was missing from it, too. Despite the “triple” of the title, the book is divided into four “Circles” to evoke a spiral, including the DNA double helix. “The spiral is a symbol that endlessly spins around itself, reflecting the infinite journey in donor conception. It’s never over. It’s a dynamic process. The book’s called Triple Helix but there are four circles. It’s deliberate, to show that things don’t quite fit. My life is like dancing to two songs simultaneously, it doesn’t quite fit,” she says. “But there are moments of transcendence. Despite all the obstacles I faced, how do you transcend your limited circumstances? These are existential questions that everyone faces: who am I? What do I do with my limited time? A question really brought into focus by Narelle.” In 2019 Burns was called back to the frontline of advocacy and is now a director of Donor Conceived Australia (DCA), a new peer-led national body advocating for a child-centred system. She’s now focused on the bigger picture: the socioeconomic structures that drive demand for donor gametes and surrogates in the first place. She also wants to continue with her writing. A big moment for her was recasting herself and her identity in relation to her biological father and the realisation she came from a family of writers. “That moment when I visited my aunt Katerina in Connecticut and was looking for a book, I saw shelves full of Clark literary output. It gave me confidence that writing was something to do. It was a weird moment of life imitating art imitating life.” Triple Helix by Lauren Burns, published by UQP, is out now",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Why did I need to know who my father was?’: one woman’s battle for her biological truth,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/05/why-did-i-need-to-know-who-my-father-was-one-womans-battle-for-her-biological-truth
3/5/2022,"With the awful fates of six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and toddler Star Hobson still vivid in memory, we have another terrible child killing: two-year-old Kyrell Matthews, who died after sustaining “blunt force trauma” over a period of weeks, according to a local safeguarding review, at the hands of his mother and her boyfriend. Kyrell, of Thornton Heath, south London, died in October 2019. He had suffered 41 rib fractures, internal bleeding, and injuries and bruising to his liver and his penis. On Friday, his mother, Phylesia Shirley, 24, and her then-partner Kemar Brown, 28, were found guilty, respectively, of manslaughter and murder. As with Arthur and Star, the brutality and cruelty was not only horrifying, but captured on the perpetrators’ mobile phones. The court was able to hear harrowing evidence of the abuse and Kyrell’s terrified screams. As before, the abusive adults seem not just sadistic, but pathetically immature and self-absorbed. Could anything have been done to save Kyrell? After the court reached its verdict, the Croydon Safeguarding Children Partnership published its review of the case, setting out in detail the last few months of the little boy’s short life. On several occasions, it found, police and social workers and other agencies missed chances to intervene. A major opportunity was missed in May 2019 when Kyrell, then aged 20 months, was taken to hospital with a serious head injury. Shirley said it was caused when her son jumped from a sofa. Clinicians assessed it as accidental, although they had remaining doubts. Croydon social services agreed to make a home visit to check up on Kyrell after his discharge. Once Kyrell was back at home, however, social services cancelled the visit because it was not a priority. As the review notes, “the threshold for a referral had not been met”. Social workers dismissed the hospital safeguarding team’s concerns as “professional anxiety”. This was a mistake the review said, but it was made, it noted, “in a bigger systems context”. What this jargon phrase blandly describes is a crisis unfolding in, but not unique to, Croydon: a children’s services department overwhelmed by the weight of referrals, with no clear and consistent thresholds for intervening to protect a child. Social work, the review found, was “crisis led” and focusing on “only the highest priority referrals”. Indeed, Croydon children’s services had been labelled “inadequate” in a devastating inspection by Ofsted two years previously. There had been some signs of progress by the time of Kyrell’s death, but it was still dogged by high staff turnover, lack of clarity over safeguarding thresholds, and a “legacy of drift”. Croydon council would declare itself bankrupt a little over a year later. It was not that Shirley received no help from the authorities. Family support services were lined up for this vulnerable single mother with a history of trauma and depression. She would agree to professional help, then ignore it. Her parenting was chaotic and inconsistent. She regularly missed GP appointments for Kyrell, and went for months without seeing a health visitor. In July, the police were called to a domestic dispute at her home after a passerby heard Shirley shouting “stop hitting my face”. No action was taken after Shirley denied she had been assaulted. The police also failed to notify children’s services: had they done so, police records would have revealed her new partner was Brown, a man with convictions for assault, possession of weapons and domestic abuse. The police visit, the review, found, was a missed opportunity, as well as the last time Kyrell was seen by any professional. Three months later he had been killed. As the senior crown prosecutor Samantha Yelland put it: “The two people who were supposed to look after him the most were those that caused injury, and in the end his death.”",News/UK news,How ‘crisis led’ Croydon children’s services failed Kyrell Matthews,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/04/crisis-led-croydon-childrens-services-failed-kyrell-matthews
3/5/2022,"Muhsin Bayrak has made an offer to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich, a representative for the Turkish businessman has told the Guardian. Abramovich put the club up for sale this week and the early favourites are a consortium headed by Todd Boehly and Hansjörg Wyss. Bayrak, the chairman of AB Grup, a construction company, signalled on Friday his desire to strike a deal. A representative, asked by the Guardian about Bayrak’s interest, said: “Yes we definitely confirm. We have forwarded our offer regarding this to them.” Bayrak’s interest first became known when he told Turkish media: “We are discussing the terms of Chelsea’s purchase with Roman Abramovich’s lawyers. We’re negotiating signatures. We will soon fly the Turkish flag in London.” Sources have said there could be up to 10 interested parties in Chelsea. The first move came from Boehly and Wyss, who are in talks with Abramovich and are confident of buying the club. It has been reported that Abramovich wants as much as £4bn but financial experts have said he is unlikely to receive much more than £2bn. Abramovich intends to leave Chelsea in good hands and does not want his successor to be politically controversial in Britain, meaning the buyer is unlikely to come from countries including China and Saudi Arabia.",Sport/Football,Turkish businessman Muhsin Bayrak says he has made offer to buy Chelsea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/04/muhsin-bayrak-turkish-businessman-says-he-has-made-offer-to-buy-chelsea-roman-abramovich
