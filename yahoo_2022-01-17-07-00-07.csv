1/17/2022,"Former President Trump on Saturday continued to raise doubt on his election loss to President Biden. During an Arizona rally, Trump pointed to the crowd size and heavy traffic to justify his opinion. Trump often uses rally figures to guage electoral success, despite them having no clear connection. Former President Donald Trump on Saturday bragged about the crowd size of an Arizona rally and pointed to heavy traffic leading into the event venue as evidence that he — and not President Joe Biden — won the 2020 election. Nearly a year after Trump departed the White House after losing his reelection bid to Biden, the former president continues to maintain that the election was fraudulent despite there being no evidence of mass irregularities and after repeated court losses by his campaign legal team. During his ""Save America"" rally in Florence — the first large-scale Trump-helmed public gathering of 2022 — the former commander-in-chief once again called the election ""fake"" before equating the breadth of his in-person rallies to the presidential election results. ""A person that comes here ... and has crowds that go further than any eye can see ... there's nobody that can see the end of this crowd,"" Trump told thousands of cheering supporters. He continued: ""And has cars that stretch out for 25 miles. That's not somebody that lost an election, and now because of it, our country is being destroyed."" While Trump sported his trademark ""Make America Great Again"" hat and spoke to roughly 15,000 supporters, per an Arizona Republic estimate, the former president went down a laundry list of grievances with the 2020 election and Biden's presidency, especially as it pertained to the state of the economy and the US-Mexico border. The Republic also reported that traffic for the Florence rally ""was backed up for more than an hour,"" with attendees waiting in lines that traversed from the front of the venue to a dirt parking lot. Trump has long equated crowd sizes to electoral support and frequently blasted Biden's scaled-down events during the presidential campaign, linking it to a lack of support for the then-Democratic nominee. Meanwhile, Biden — who had sought to adhere to social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic — generally stuck with hosting outdoor events like drive-in rallies. Trump has teased a 2024 presidential run for almost a year, notably at the multiple rallies that he held in support of Republican candidates last year, and during the Saturday event. During a Fox News interview last November, Trump said that a final decision was still up in the air. ""I am certainly thinking about it and we'll see,"" he told the outlet at the time. ""I think a lot of people will be very happy, frankly, with the decision, and probably will announce that after the midterms."" Arizona was one of the hardest-fought states of the 2020 presidential election — and the longtime conservative stronghold will be hotly contested again in 2024 as well. Last year, Biden became the first Democratic presidential nominee since Bill Clinton in 1996 to win the state's electoral votes, edging out Trump by 10,457 votes out of nearly 3.4 million ballots cast.

1/17/2022,"LONDON (AP) — Tesla is turning to Mozambique for a key component in its electric car batteries in what analysts believe is a first-of-its-kind deal designed to reduce its dependence on China for graphite. Elon Musk's company signed an agreement last month with Australia's Syrah Resources, which operates one of the world’s largest graphite mines in the southern African country. It's a unique partnership between an electric vehicle manufacturer and a producer of the mineral that is critical for lithium-ion batteries. The value of the deal hasn't been released. Tesla will buy the material from the company's processing plant in Vidalia, Louisiana, which sources graphite from its mine in Balama, Mozambique. The Austin, Texas-based electric automaker plans to buy up 80% of what the plant produces — 8,000 tons of graphite per year — starting in 2025, according to the agreement. Syrah must prove the material meets Tesla’s standards. The deal is part of Tesla's plan to ramp up its capacity to make its own batteries so it can reduce its dependence on China, which dominates global graphite markets, said Simon Moores of United Kingdom-based battery materials data and intelligence provider, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. “It starts at the top with geopolitics,” Moores said. “The U.S. wants to build enough capacity domestically to be able to build (lithium-ion batteries) within the USA. And this deal will permit Tesla to source graphite independent from China.” Moores said producing the batteries in the U.S. will reduce some of the questions Tesla is facing about its ties to China, where there are environmental concerns at some mines. The automaker also has set up a showroom in the region of Xinjiang, where Chinese officials are accused of forced labor and other human rights abuses against mostly Muslim ethnic minorities. A message was left seeking comment from Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department. The battery industry has been confronted with a short supply of graphite in recent months, Moores said. Graphite stores lithium inside a battery until it’s needed to generate electricity by splitting into charged ions and electrons. It comes as every major automaker is racing to get into electric vehicles amid concerns about climate change. Tesla is making almost a million electric cars per year, and sourcing enough batteries is its biggest constraint, he said. “They’ve upped their own battery manufacturing capacity,” Moores said, but still “they can’t get enough batteries.” A new battery factory that the company is building in its new hometown of Austin, Texas, will allow it to get closer to self-sufficiency, but Moores said it is still buying batteries from other manufacturers, “and that won’t change this decade.” For instance, Tesla has a deal with Panasonic to make battery cells at the automaker's battery factory near Reno, Nevada. The deal with Syrah is part of a broader effort by automakers to secure relatively scarce raw materials for batteries as demand for electric vehicles is expected to grow, said Sam Abuelsamid, principal e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Insights. The deal also brings the graphite processed in Louisiana much closer to Tesla's U.S. factories. “The pandemic pointed out to us that we've got these long, long, long supply chains, and it doesn’t take much to disrupt a supply chain,” said Donald Sadoway, a professor of materials chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Somebody could all of the sudden say, ‘We’re going to jack up the prices,' or ‘We’re going to refuse to ship it.'"" It's unlikely that the Tesla deal with Syrah will rankle the Chinese government because China has plenty of markets for its graphite, including increased domestic electric vehicle production, Abuelsamid said. China, though, is Tesla's biggest global market. It has a giant factory near Shanghai and sells about 450,000 vehicles per year there, compared with about 350,000 in the U.S., Abuelsamid said. For the Australian mining firm, the deal is “crucial” because it has a non-Chinese purchaser for its graphite product, Moores said. Syrah’s graphite mine in Mozambique’s northernmost province, Cabo Delgado, is one of the world’s largest, with an ability to produce 350,000 tons of flake graphite a year. Cabo Delgado has faced violence in recent years by Islamic extremists, an insurgency that has recently extended inland from coastal areas toward the neighboring Niassa province. The mine is on the main road connecting the Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces, a thoroughfare that has been recently upgraded by a Chinese contractor. At a ceremony to reopen the road in December, President Filipe Nyusi called for vigilance so the road isn't used by insurgents. ___ Tom Krisher reported from Detroit.",Business/Associated Press,Tesla inks deal to get key battery component outside China,https://news.yahoo.com/tesla-inks-deal-key-battery-083244713.html
1/17/2022,"A video shows a Florida police officer fatally shooting a dog while responding to a barking complaint. Miami-Dade police said the investigation is active and open, and the dog owners have retained an attorney. Viewer discretion is advised as some might find the video disturbing. A Florida police officer fired a gun six times at a family's dog and killed him while responding to a barking complaint, said NBC 6 South Florida. Home surveillance footage obtained by CBS4 News captures the incident, which took place around 7pm on January 12 in unincorporated Miami-Dade near Miami Gardens. In the video, the unidentified officer can be seen standing in the home's driveway, where he was responding to a call regarding dogs barking, according to CBS4. Two dogs, a white Maltese and a black American Bully, can be seen coming out of the house and approaching the officer. The officer points his gun at the dogs and can be heard asking the homeowners to ""grab the dog"" in Spanish. The dogs run out of the driveway and towards another police officer, and then the black dog starts barking and runs beyond the fence, where the first police officer is now standing. The officer then fires six shots in quick succession, killing the dog. The video then shows a man and a woman running out of the house towards the police officer, and the woman begins to scream and cry once she sees the dead dog. Miami-Dade police told CBS4 News that it is an active and open investigation, and the outlet reported that the dog owners had retained an attorney. Animal rights activists have criticized the incident, arguing that police officers should be better trained in how to handle animals. ""This incident did not have had to happen if the officer had been properly trained. We must do better to protect our 4-legged family members,"" advocacy group Miami Coalition Against Breed Specific Legislation said in a statement, reported by CBS4.

1/17/2022,"“HONK IF YOU HATE N*GGERS,” the sign read on Saturday in Sumter, South Carolina Police are on a search in South Carolina for the person who tampered with an electronic road sign, changing its text to display a racial slur. The text on the sign, set up in the city of Sumter, was altered to display an offensive command that included the n-word. Sumter has a population of roughly 43,000 with a racial divide of roughly 49% Black and 44% white, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. “HONK IF YOU HATE N*GGERS,” the sign read. The Sumter Police Department said its officers were notified about the situation around 4:30 p.m. on Saturday. The digital message board was placed in a high-traffic area on on South Pike West near US Route 76 in East Sumter to warn drivers about an ongoing road construction project, officials say. The racist language on the sign has been removed, police said. Sumter Police Chief Russell Roark characterized the incident as an extremely disturbing “scar on the city and its residents that is in no way indicative of the community where we work and live.” “We will investigate this to the fullest,” Roark said in a statement. On Sunday, Sumter Police released screenshots of surveillance video footage that they said shows a man walking near the corrupted sign on Saturday. The department is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. “Anyone who recognizes this person or knows anything about this incident is asked to call the Sumter Police Department at 803-436-2700 or Crime Stoppers at 1-888-CRIME-SC,” the department said.

1/17/2022,"Republican Jason Mariner has not conceded in Florida's 20th District special election House race. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a progressive Democrat, beat Mariner in a 79%-20% landslide. Mariner filed a lawsuit before the election had been called, only telling CBS Miami that ""stuff"" had been ""discovered."" A Florida Republican who last Tuesday lost a congressional special election by a landslide margin in a heavily Democratic district has declined to concede the race, according to CBS Miami. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick — a progressive Democrat who pledged to fight for $1,000 monthly checks for Americans and backs policies including the Green New Deal and Medicare for All — easily defeated Republican Jason Mariner in a race to succeed the late Congressman Alcee Hastings, who passed away in April 2021. With all precincts reporting, Cherfilus-McCormick defeated Mariner by a 78.7% to 19.6% margin in Florida's 20th District — representing a 59.1 percentage-point victory. The congresswoman received 43,663 votes to her opponent's 10,883 votes in a clear victory. However, in a move reminiscent of former President Donald Trump, who continues to dispute his election loss to President Joe Biden, Mariner has pointed to irregularities in the South Florida district. ""Now they called the race — I did not win, so they say, but that does not mean that they lost either, it does not mean that we lost,"" the Republican told CBS after the race was called for Cherfilus-McCormick. Before the polls closed for the special election, Mariner filed a lawsuit pointing to ballot issues in Broward and Palm Beach counties, the two populous Democratic-leaning jurisdictions that anchor the district. ""We'll also have some stuff coming out that we've recently discovered,"" Mariner told the television station, without disclosing any developments that could affect the outcome. Cherfilus-McCormick — who eked by former Democratic primary contender Dale Holness by five votes in a multicandidate Democratic primary in November — brushed off Mariner's move. ""Well, this wouldn't be my first time running against an opponent who is refusing to concede, so it's not our first time, and at the end of the day nothing can stop the motion,"" she told CBS. Holness, a former Broward County Commissioner, filed a lawsuit in November to invalidate the Democratic primary results, alleging that Cherfilus-McCormick's advocacy for a universal basic income plan was tantamount to bribing voters. Election officials in Broward and Palm Beach counties told CBS that the election results would be certified in 14 days — with challenges permitted for 10 days after that point. While candidates who are unsuccessful in their races aren't legally bound to formally concede, Trump's continued refusal to acknowledge his loss to Biden despite a clear 306-232 Electoral College victory for the president has morphed into a major point of contention for partisans, from the grassroots level to the halls of Congress. In the wake of Trump's 2020 presidential loss, Republicans across the country have raced to implement voting restrictions, fueled by the former president's debunked claims of voter fraud. Congressional Democrats have sought to nullify many of the provisions of Republican-led bills with the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act — but have been stymied by resistance to filibuster reform from Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, along with near-unanimous GOP opposition to the bills.

1/17/2022,"Bodybuilder and coach Paul Revelia has made several videos breaking down his tactics for getting lean ahead of a physique competition, and how he uses walking as his main form of cardio during a cut. In a new YouTube post, Revelia explains why he opts for this low-impact approach, over something like running, and why sustainability is important. ""The energy deficit and oxygen deficit that you create doing a sprint can actually backfire,"" he says. ""First of all, you're not using fat as the primary fuel source... the lower the intensity of the activity, the higher the use of fat for your primary fuel source."" He goes on to demonstrate his usual cardio routine, which consists of five 30-minute walking sessions. If he then finds that he is not losing weight with this routine, he doesn't add time onto his sessions, but rather intensity, by increasing the incline and speed on the treadmill so that he is still only walking for 30 minutes at a time. And in order to ensure he never misses a session, Revelia has stationed his treadmill right in front of the TV so this time can double up as entertainment. ""Try to make your cardiovascular exercise, your daily routine, enjoyable,"" he says. ""If it's something that doesn't excite you or bring you pleasure, you're much less likely to do it."" Just as important as exercise, of course, is diet, especially when your goal is fat loss. ""You cannot simply do cardio and expect to lose weight if you are not paying attention to your nutrition,"" says Revelia. ""Certain types of cardio are actually going to increase your hunger... if you do certain types of cardio you're going to end up eating more to compensate for that energy,"" he says. ""You need to have a baseline knowledge of your daily caloric intake and your daily activity,"" he adds. ""You burn calories not just when you're doing cardio, but all throughout the day... I'm not a big believer in severely restricting calories to lose weight, because it's a short term. You're going to lose weight initially, but what happens is eventually you're not going to be able to keep up with the low-calorie approach, your body is going to adapt, you're going to start restricting your movements, energy conservation is going to happen, so I'd rather we take an approach where we understand the balance between how many calories we're taking in and the movement we're doing.""

The bull charged each flag just the same. To further test this color theory, a team member jumped into the ring with the bull while wearing a red jumpsuit and stayed still, while two professional cowboys ran around the ring. The bull paid no mind to the red jumpsuit, proving that the movement of a waving cape is what taunts the bull. So why red? Long ago in bull fights, the matador would use the cape, or muleta, to conceal a sword in the final round. When the bull charges towards them, the matador would pierce the bull with sword, and the red cape would conceal the bloodstains. It makes sense, but now I feel sad.

That's why they spread more easily during the winter, or when it's raining. So you can catch a cold when it's raining, but not because it's raining. Even more reasons to wear a mask, or not kiss strangers in the rain (unless you're in a rom-com!).

And that's why we have the gift of that infamous Apple store Vine. There's always exceptions, but if you ever have a meltdown out in the streets and end up on r/PublicFreakout, just know that it's likely law-compliant. —u/Wisebutt98 Today, the phrase ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" is used to convey self-reliance and advice to pull yourself out of poverty, particularly when it's tossed around in politics. However, its modern usage is incredibly ironic since the phrase was first used in 1836 to convey the impossible task of lifting yourself over a fence by pulling your bootstraps. This will help you put your boots on, but not jump a fence. As the phrase was passed on, its humorous intent was lost and it began to be taken literally around the early twentieth century, just a few years ahead of the Great Depression. How convenient.

If there is no heartbeat, or the person is not breathing, shocking the heart isn't helpful, and the AED won't deliver a current. In this case, the person needs CPR, not an electric jumpstart. So why does this myth still persist today? Hollywood, baby! —u/Legitimate-Lobster16 In the first year of the pandemic, unemployment rates skyrocketed, corporate profits plummeted, and many small businesses had no choice but to permanently close up shop, but the stock market was doing extremely well. April 2020 was the S&P stock index's best month in 33 years.  That's because the majority of shares in the stock market are owned by the richest people in the States, not the middle class. And the wealthy elite are a lot less likely to be affected by any economic downturn, so they're able to invest in huge corporations like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook.  Historians believe that the stock market remains linked to the country's economic health because of the 1929 stock market crash. The S&P fell an astounding 86% within two years, and with little economic information, Americans believed that this was the cause of the Great Depression.

I'm totally paraphrasing here, but his assessment has stuck with us ever since.  Now, the majority of researchers agree that Neanderthals were highly intelligent, extremely innovative, and impressively compassionate beings. They created highly functioning tools like spearpoints, knives, and stone tools for woodworking. Neanderthal skeletons that show extreme signs of trauma, like partially-crushed skulls and worn-down knees, are proof that these people cared for one other. They even buried each other.

Besides that, corsets were working garments, so they morphed with the people who wore them and came with built-in flexibility. Even working-class women wore corsets, so they needed to be functional. There were even corsets for cycling. It's safe to say that corsets are in their Reputation era, and that the misinformation about them is rooted in later society ridiculing women fashion as a desperate attempt to attract male attention.

Hoover, former President Truman, and the infamous senator Joseph McCarthy, all jumped at labeling any kind of protest as a communist effort.

However, this is totally normal. And healthy. During sexual arousal, the muscles of the vagina relax and will temporarily open up before, during, and after sex to help penetration, but will return to its usual shape.

1/17/2022,"By Sergiy Karazy WARSAW (Reuters) - Former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said on Sunday he planned to return to Ukraine on Monday despite the threat of arrest in a treason case he says was trumped up by allies of current President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Poroshenko's return sets up a showdown with Zelenskiy's government in what critics say is an ill-judged distraction at a time when Ukraine is bracing for a possible Russian military offensive and appealing to Western allies for support. Western diplomats have called for political unity in Ukraine ahead of Poroshenko's arrival. Poroshenko is being investigated for alleged treason linked to the financing of Russian-backed separatist fighters through illegal coal sales while in office in 2014-15. His party accused Zelenskiy of a reckless attempt to silence political opposition. ""If you ask me if I will be arrested, definitely not. Not because I am so confident but because I have no, absolutely zero reason for tha...I return to Ukraine to fight for Ukraine, not to fight with Zelenskiy,"" Poroshenko told reporters in Warsaw. Zelenskiy's administration has distanced itself from the investigation, saying the prosecutors and judiciary are independent and accusing Poroshenko of thinking he was above the law. On Friday, Zelenskiy's chief of staff Andriy Yermak batted away suggestions that Zelenskiy was behaving like the Russian-backed former president Viktor Yanukovich, whose political rival Yulia Tymoshenko was jailed in December 2010. Ukraine and its allies have sounded the alarm about tens of thousands of Russian troops massed near its borders. After days of diplomacy last week achieved no breakthrough, the United States said on Friday Russia was preparing a pretext for an attack, something the Kremlin dismissed as ""unfounded"". ""At this time more than ever it seems to me that all political leaders in #ukraine need to show unity, avoiding actions that may polarise,"" Melinda Simmons, the British ambassador to Ukraine, said in a tweet on Saturday. ""We are demanding unity of the whole democratic forces to protect Ukraine...I am absolutely optimistic about the possibility of this unity, of democratic, responsible opposition forces,"" Poroshenko said. Poroshenko's return to Kyiv from Warsaw on Monday coincides with the whistle-stop visit from the new German foreign minister, who will then head to Moscow for talks on Tuesday. A confectionary tycoon and one of Ukraine's richest citizens, Poroshenko was elected as head of a pro-Western government after the 2014 Maidan street protests ousted Yanukovich. Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed after Russia's annexation of Crimea and support for separatist fighters in a war in eastern Ukraine that broke out the same year. Zelenskiy trounced Poroshenko in a landslide election in 2019 on a ticket to tackle corruption and curb the influence of oligarchs in the former Soviet republic. Prosecutors in December asked a Ukrainian court to arrest Poroshenko, with the possibility of bail set at 1 billion hryvnia ($37 million).
