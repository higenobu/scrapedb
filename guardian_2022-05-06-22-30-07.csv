5/6/2022,"British Airways’ owner has said a recovery in business travel and trips by wealthy passengers will drive a return to profitability this year. International Airlines Group (IAG), which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, said that while Omicron had a short-term impact on bookings in January and February, the easing of coronavirus-related travel restrictions had improved travel demand in the first quarter, particularly in the UK. “Demand is recovering strongly in line with our previous expectations,” said Luis Gallego, the chief executive of IAG. “We expect to be profitable from the second quarter onwards and for the full year. Premium leisure continues to be the strongest performing segment and business travel is at its highest level since the start of the pandemic.” The company, which reported an operating loss of €731m (£625m) in the first quarter compared with more than €1bn in the same period last year, added that there had been “no noticeable impact” on the business from the war in Ukraine. Analysts’ consensus on IAG, which made a €3.5bn loss in 2021, was for an operating loss of about €510m in the first three months of the year. Shares fell 8% on Friday, making IAG the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. Gallego said that by the third quarter, demand across the all-important UK-US travel corridor would almost be back to pre-pandemic levels. “As a result of the increasing demand, forward bookings remain encouraging,” he said. “We expect to achieve 80% of 2019 capacity in the second quarter and 85% in the third quarter. North Atlantic capacity will be close to fully restored in the third quarter.” The resurgence in demand is also taking place in the hotel sector, with the revenues of InterContinental Hotels Group, the owner of chains including Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn, up 61% year on year in the first quarter and the average daily room rate back to pre-pandemic levels. “We’ve seen very positive trading conditions in the first quarter, with travel demand continuing to increase in almost all of our key markets around the world,” said Keith Barr, the chief executive of IHG. “The high level of demand we have seen for leisure travel continues to drive increased rates and occupancy. We also continue to see a return of business and group travel.” IAG’s Gallego warned the strong recovery, which has resulted in long delays at understaffed airports and airlines cancelling hundreds of flights, has led to the biggest scaling-up operation in airline history. “Globally, the travel industry is facing challenges as a result of the biggest scaling up in operations in history and British Airways is no exception,” he said. “The airline’s focus at the moment is on improving operations and customer experience and enhancing operational resilience.” BA has come in for some criticism over its cancellations, and the chief executive, Sean Doyle, said: “We’re acutely aware of the issues that we’re facing at the moment, and we’re working hard at addressing all of the pain points.” Another 500 call centre agents were joining to boost customer service, among the 6,000 additional staff the airline plans to recruit this year, he said. Doyle also hit out at Heathrow for not reopening all of its terminals swiftly enough and being “unrealistic about the rebound in demand”, with the airport having issued gloomy forecasts for the recovery. Doyle added that higher volumes of passengers would lower the airport’s charges under the model agreed by the regulator: “If Heathrow build their operational capability for the demand that’s out there, charges should fall and consumers get a better deal.”",News/Business,BA owner says recovery of business travel will drive return to profit,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/06/ba-owner-says-recovery-of-business-travel-will-drive-return-to-profit-iag
5/6/2022,"McColl’s is set to appoint administrators, putting 16,000 jobs at risk, after its lenders turned down a last minute rescue deal from Morrisons. It is understood that EG Group, the petrol forecourts operator owned by the Issa brothers, is lined up to buy McColl’s out of administration. No deal has been finalised, however, and other offers could yet win out. McColl’s, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said its shares were being suspended with immediate effect. The convenience store chain said it had applied to the courts to appoint administrators from PricewaterhouseCoopers after its lenders had declined to extend credit further and had “made clear that they were not satisfied that discussions [with Morrisons] would reach an outcome acceptable to them”. The company said it expected administrators to secure a sale of the business “as soon as possible”. Morrisons put forward a last-minute rescue deal for the McColl’s convenience store chain late on Thursday in attempt to secure its relationship with the retailer, which operates about 250 of its Morrisons Daily outlets. . The supermarket chain is understood to have offered to take on the ailing business as a going concern, assuming its debts, which amount to about £100m, and taking responsibility for its pension scheme, which had a deficit of about £3m when it was last assessed in 2019. The deal was put forward after McColl’s, which has more than 1,100 small shops around the UK warned it was “increasingly likely” to call in administrators. McColl’s has been in talks for the past six months with its lenders after being hit by supply difficulties and poor sales. Apart from Morrisons, other lenders are thought to include the Issa brothers, who own Asda as well as the EG petrol station group. The deal, which was first reported by Sky News, would have protected Morrisons’ supply agreement with McColl’s, to which it provides a range of products under the Safeway brand, but would be an additional financial burden for the UK’s fourth-largest supermarket, which was bought out by the US private equity group Clayton, Dubilier & Rice last year. While many convenience stores did well during the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic, with families choosing to shop closer to home and avoiding big supermarkets, McColl’s lost out. The group struggled to get enough products on shelves. Its generally smaller stores were also more set up for quick purchases by commuters and those on the school run rather than a weekly shop. The group has struggled since the collapse of its former wholesale supplier Palmer & Harvey in 2017, which left it with heavy costs and disruption to deliveries. Since then its supply chain has been further disrupted by another supply partner, Nisa, being taken over by the Co-op and a new deal with Morrisons. Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst at Shopfloor Insights, said: “McColl’s should have had a good pandemic but it does not have a full range and its pricing is out of kilter. It is somewhere you go because you have to, not because you want to.” McColl’s traces its roots back to 1901 when a Scottish footballer, Robert Smyth McColl, opened the first RS McColl in Glasgow. The modern business began in 1973 as a vending machine operator and went on to buy several convenience store chains before focusing solely on retail in 2000.",News/Business,"McColl’s to call in administrators, putting 16,000 jobs as risk",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/06/morrisons-in-last-minute-attempt-to-rescue-mccolls-and-16000-jobs
5/6/2022,"Wives of Ukrainian soldiers under siege in Mariupol gathering in Kyiv to demand the evacuation of their husbands have been dispersed by police who gave army conscription notices to the male protestors. Around 50 people had defied a government ban on Friday morning to take part in a protest on the Ukrainian capital’s independence square where they called for negotiations with the Russians over the soldiers fate. The UN has opened a fresh attempt to rescue the remaining 200 civilians trapped in the Russian-besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, which the UN secretary general has described as a series of “hellscapes”. However, the negotiations with the Russian military have not included the fate of around 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers fighting at the sprawling works, leading to a series of protests in recent days by their relatives. Police officers ordered the women at the latest protest to leave the square as the event had not been authorised and gave conscription orders to a number of men. Yulia Girdvilis, the head of the communication department of Kyiv police, said: “There were no arrests. There were police officers at the event who explained that during the martial law mass events are not allowed and people dispersed on their own. “There were military commissars present at the event who had the authority to check men’s documents. Some of the men in their 30s were taken to the draft boards [conscription offices] for further investigations.” Maria, 32, a representative of wives and relatives of the soldiers, whose own partner, Artem, 29, was killed in the last week during the fighting, said they were all in a state of turmoil. She said: “I am representing not only Azov regiment relatives but all of the military. We have a right to be explained. We are not against the government, they gathered there just to fight for their families’ rights. “They are in a very difficult mental condition. It’s even hard to find out who’s alive who isn’t. We are just representing our families’ interests. That’s all. She added that a number of the protestors had posed for photographers but had been told by police not to show posters referring to Mariupol. “The girls asked the police could we be photographed and they said yes just take your ‘Save Mariupol’ posters away,” she said. “We think it’s wrong because we just want some representative from the authorities to come out and give us some explanations. What’s happening? Just let us know that they didn’t forget about our soldiers that they are doing something.” The protest on Friday morning had been formally cancelled by organisers after permission was withheld at the last minute, it is understood. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said people would be evacuated from Mariupol at midday local time on Friday. The UN and the Red Cross said they had so far helped nearly 500 civilians flee the steel plant area in the southern port city during two operations in the past week.",News/World news,Wives of Mariupol soldiers dispersed by police at Kyiv protest ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/wives-mariupol-soldiers-dispersed-police-kyiv-protest-ukraine-russia
5/6/2022,"Unsurprisingly, my friends always expect me to bring a decent bottle of wine whenever I come to stay, but they don’t generally specify what colour it should be. The other week, however, one pal pleaded plaintively: “Pleeease could you bring some white – we always seem to be running out.” That’s a situation in which I, too, frequently find myself, especially at this time of year, when I’m not quite into full rosé mode, but am eating fresher, lighter food than I was just a month ago. The trouble is that white wine is more Marmite than red: people will tell you they hate chardonnay, they’re bored with sauvignon blanc and/or that they find riesling too sweet – and, of course, that natural wines are too weird. Grape varieties are not uniform, though. Your chardonnay-hater, for instance, may well like chablis and your sauvignon-sceptic sancerre (though they may not be able to afford it these days), while riesling can be dry as well as sweet (and is particularly good with spicier food such as Thai). Also, some whites are less divisive than others – I rarely come across anyone who dislikes albariño or picpoul, say. And if you feel that pinot grigio is a bit of a cop-out, you’ll probably get away with a verdicchio dei castelli di Jesi (Morrisons has a decent one in its The Best range), and for much the same price. Rueda, meanwhile, might strike your hosts as cooler than sauvignon blanc, but in fact isn’t that dissimilar in character, and many bottles from the region include it: rioja producer Beronia makes a good one that’s currently on offer at Waitrose for £6.99, and that would work really well with in-season asparagus. Now is also the perfect time of year for English white wines, which tend to be light and low in alcohol, making them ideal with young goat or sheep cheeses, leafy salads and herbs such as tarragon and chervil. And if you have friends who are into wine, you’ll get extra brownie points for bringing along bottles featuring more unusual grape varieties such as Sicily’s carricante or from lesser-known wine-producing regions such as the Savoie white in today’s pick, which is made from the rare jacquère. Do bear in mind, too, that white wine generally benefits from being drunk young – most cheaper wines are already on to the 2021 vintage, though 2020s should still be tasting fresh, especially if they’re bottled under screw-cap. And remember that, while they should be served cold, they shouldn’t be over-chilled, or you’ll dumb down the flavour. Specially Selected Picpoul de Pinet 2021 £6.49 Aldi, 12.5%. Picpoul’s been creeping up in price lately, but this latest Aldi vintage is a bargain. Eidos de Padriñán Albariño 2020 £15.95 (or £13.95 as part of a mixed case) Lea & Sandeman, 13%. Really gorgeous: crisp, fresh and saline. Perfect for seafood. The Society’s English White 2021 £8.50 The Wine Society, 12%. There’s no better time of year to drink English wine, and this is an unusually well-priced example. Try it with a crab sandwich. Domaine de L’Idylle Cruet Vieilles Vignes 2021 £14.90 Yapp Brothers, 11.5%. A delicate, crisp, alpine white from under-the-radar Savoie. Would be perfect with oysters, or with cheese.

5/6/2022,"I have been divorced for eight years and my daughter, who is 10, lives with her mum. I usually see her every other weekend. I say “usually”, because my daughter’s timetable is very much driven by her mother and the time with me is a “fit in”. It has been like this for four years. My ex and I have both moved on to new relationships. There have been occasions where my ex and I argue about the time my daughter gets to spend with me. My daughter will call and tell me that she wants to do something else (go to a birthday party, say) on a weekend that she had been supposed to spend with me. When my ex and I argue, this understandably upsets my daughter, and I think she feels conflicted over which parent to support. When my daughter is with me we have great fun and I value the father-daughter time: like most 10-year-olds she talks a lot, tells me her stories. I recently saw her perform at school (my ex attended as well) and afterwards, I waited for her to come out. When she did she very much acted as if I was a stranger, and behaving in the opposite way to how she does when she is at home with me. She seems to act like that only when her mother is around; the last time was when my daughter invited me to a school fair. Is this normal for children with divorced parents? How can I approach this behaviour with my daughter? It’s great when visiting arrangements can be agreed on informally (ie without going to court) but this does leave them open to interpretation, and abuse. What changed four years ago to impact on your time with your daughter? Children do become more self-conscious as they get older (this process peaks in adolescence) and ignoring parents is fairly common, however upsetting. However, I see this is about more than that. When was the last time you and your ex sat down and calmly discussed how often you see your daughter, rather than waiting until it’s an argument that would be upsetting for all concerned, but especially your daughter? Of course as she gets older, she has other things to do and her focus shifts from parents to friends, but it’s important that visits are discussed and some rules agreed upon. Maybe the next time your daughter can’t be with you you can make sure your time together is rearranged. Would family mediation (familymediationcouncil.org.uk) help if you and your ex find it hard to talk? Family psychotherapist John Cavanagh sees this sort of situation a lot, and he felt your daughter may be struggling with divided loyalties: “She may be wondering how to divide her time so she’s fair to you and her mum, and it may feel easier spending time with her mum as she lives with her.” Cavanagh also thought your daughter might be trying not to upset either of you, a tough call for a child. He also wondered if school functions were a particular situation where your daughter isn’t “sure how to alter her behaviour if she’s only used to seeing one parent [at a time]”. Does she see you both of together very much? Would it be possible for the three of you – or even the five of you, with your new partners – to spend time together so your daughter gets used to seeing her parent together, instead of one or the other? Cavanagh agreed that another conversation about visits is in order. He also suggested trying to repair your relationship with your ex if it has got tricky, because that will make “having those difficult conversations easier”. Unfortunately a lot of separated parents use their children as currency, rather than working on their relationship as separated parents to enable them to co-parent effectively. It’s great that you and your daughter get on well when you are together. This might be a good time to talk about what she needs, what she finds difficult about the arrangement and work out a way to try to overcome those difficulties. Don’t make it about you: don’t say things like “Daddy gets upset when …” but “that looked like a difficult situation for you; what did you need in that moment?” Don’t expect instant answers, she’s only 10, but putting her needs and feelings first will be a relief for her. And however tempting this is, don’t criticise her mum: children have a really strong sense of justice and having one parent “vent” about the other puts them in an impossible situation.

5/6/2022,"The reigning W Series champion Jamie Chadwick is expecting a serious, multiple-driver challenge for this year’s title when the championship begins its third season with a double header of races on the Formula One bill, beginning on Saturday in Miami. In the buildup to the opening meeting the British driver, who has won the first two of the all-female series titles, was also confident the championship was succeeding in transforming the careers of female drivers. Last year the 23-year-old Chadwick was pushed to the wire by Alice Powell, with the season decided at the final race in Austin. She considers Britain’s Powell and Finland’s Emma Kimiläinen, who was third last year, will lead a formidable challenge from the 18-driver grid. “Definitely it will be a big fight,” she said. “I am under no illusions as to how tough it is going to be, there are young drivers coming through but there’s also Alice and Emma. I would anticipate this year will not be a two-way fight, there will be more drivers pushing hard for it,” Five new drivers join the championship this season which will be contested across 10 races, all at F1 meetings, and for the first time will visit Asia with a race at Suzuka in Japan. With the aim of ultimately helping a female driver secure an F1 drive, Chadwick believes the series is already succeeding by showcasing the talent of its competitors. “The W Series is transforming female drivers’ careers,” she said. “Drivers like Alice who wasn’t able to race for three or four years and has had this opportunity to come back and get professional roles in the sport. Then there are the young girls coming through who are on a career trajectory to use W Series as the springboard it is.”",Sport/Sport,Jamie Chadwick expecting tough fight for title as W Series season begins,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/06/jamie-chadwick-expecting-tough-fight-for-title-as-w-series-season-begins
5/6/2022,"Senior staff at the Czech-owned company that won the next 10-year licence to run the National Lottery were handed a pay rise of nearly 40% for their work in the year leading up to their defeat of the incumbent, Camelot. Allwyn fended off three competitors for the right to operate the National Lottery, starting from 2024, after a bitter battle with Camelot, Italy’s Sisal, and the media tycoon Richard Desmond. The decision, taken by the Gambling Commission earlier this year, means Camelot will lose control of the lottery for the first time in almost 30 years, pending the outcome of a legal challenge it has lodged alongside Desmond. The annual report of the Sazka Group, Allwyn’s parent company, shows that senior staff were paid a combined £10.3m for their work in 2021. The pay of 11 members of the board and “key management personnel” increased by 39% on the £7.4m pot they shared the year before. The wage rise covered a year in which the lottery company’s revenues, after gaming duties, increased by 51% to €1.8bn (£1.5bn), with pre-tax profit more than doubling to €578m. The annual report also details the scale of planned investment in Allwyn by the Sazka Group, a conglomerate owned by the Czech billionaire Karel Komárek. Sazka has committed to providing Allwyn with £329m of working capital to fund day-to-day operations, as well as $70m (£57m) to invest in capital expenditure. The money was pledged to “support transition, implementation and ongoing operations” if Allwyn beat Camelot to the fourth National Lottery licence. Allwyn won the lottery competition after hiring a number of British business grandees to support its bid, including Sir Keith Mills, known for inventing the Air Miles and Nectar Card loyalty schemes, as well as running London’s successful bid to host the 2012 Olympics. He was joined by the former Sainsbury’s boss Justin King, who had worked with Mills on the delivery of the Games and now chairs Allwyn UK. Neither is included among the executives and managers who shared in the £10.3m pay arrangements disclosed in Sazka’s annual report. The annual report also dismissed suggestions that Komárek’s business interests could be affected by sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Komárek has a gas storage venture with the Kremlin-controlled energy firm Gazprom in his native Czech Republic but has condemned Putin’s “barbarism” and worked with the Prague government on a plan to nationalise the asset. Sazka’s annual report said it had no operations in Russia or Ukraine and “no exposure to sanctioned entities or persons”.

5/6/2022,"The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, will face a police investigation into allegations he broke lockdown rules by having a bottle of beer and a takeaway meal with staff during campaigning for the 2021 Hartlepool byelection. Durham police faced mounting calls to investigate and held off until now because of the local elections. The force had previously said there were no grounds to investigate the incident that took place in a Labour constituency office in Durham last April. A changing story from Labour is part of the reason for the change in police thinking. The party initially claimed the deputy leader, Angela Rayner, was not present, but then admitted she was. In a statement, Durham police said: “Earlier this year, Durham constabulary carried out an assessment as to whether Covid-19 regulations had been breached at a gathering in Durham City on 30 April 2021. “At that time, it was concluded that no offence had been established and therefore no further action would be taken. Following the receipt of significant new information over recent days, Durham constabulary has reviewed that position and now, following the conclusion of the pre-election period, we can confirm that an investigation into potential breaches of Covid-19 regulations relating to this gathering is now being conducted.” A Labour party spokesperson said: “We’re obviously happy to answer anyquestions there are and we remain clear that no rules were broken.” The investigation into whether lockdown rules were broken will be similar to that Durham held into Dominic Cummings in 2020, when the then top aide to Boris Johnson drove from London to the north-east of England despite strict lockdown rules. Durham said in 2020 it did not issue fines retrospectively, but the Metropolitan police, which covers London, has been issuing fines for past breaches against Boris Johnson and his aides over a series of parties and gatherings held in Westminster. Labour has said no rules were broken but Tory MPs and supporting newspapers have waged a campaign to say police should change their initial view that there were no grounds to investigate. Police say they have received “correspondence” over the issue. Labour’s defence has been that the takeaway was necessary for campaign staff, who carried on working while eating. But reports have questioned the volume of food and alcohol supplied as well as Labour’s claim there were no alternative options for dinner. Starmer said the food had been ordered as the staff prepared an online event for members. “In Durham, all restaurants and pubs were closed, so takeaways really were the only way you could eat. So this was brought in and at various points people went through to the kitchen and had something to eat, and got on with their work,” he said. He added: “We were very careful to abide by the rules … and we did it within my family. My wife’s father is very elderly and had to shield in difficult circumstances that I won’t go into. My wife went and sat on the pavement outside his house. All she wanted to do, like many families, is she wanted to go in and clean and she didn’t because the rules didn’t allow her. So I know what that feels like.” Starmer has claimed the Tories are “mudslinging” over their allegations that he broke Covid rules, to distract from the prime minister’s own lawbreaking, for which he was issued a fixed-penalty notice. Johnson paid a fine for attending his birthday party in June 2020, and is still facing investigations over his alleged attendance at several other parties. Durham police, when declining previously to investigate, had said: “Durham constabulary has reviewed video footage recorded in Durham on 30 April 2021. We do not believe an offence has been established in relation to the legislation and guidance in place at that time and will therefore take no further action in relation to this matter.”",News/UK news,Keir Starmer faces police investigation over lockdown breach claims,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/06/keir-starmer-faces-police-investigation-over-lockdown-breach-claims-beer
5/6/2022,"Healthy younger people in the UK may never be offered another Covid jab, a leading expert has said, as a new wave of infections is expected to hit the country in the coming weeks. Giving his personal expert opinion, Adam Finn, a professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol and a member of the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, suggested there was little point in offering a fourth jab to those yet to pass middle age, at least in the current landscape. “I think it’s questionable whether young, healthy people will ever be offered another Covid vaccine beyond dose three – at least with the vaccines and variants we have now,” Finn said, although he added both could change. “You just don’t achieve anything very useful by [further] immunising healthy young people with these vaccines because they rarely get sick – which the vaccines prevent,” he said, adding that vaccines offered poor and short-lived protection against mild infection and onwards transmission. In March, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, suggested the second booster programme could be expanded in the autumn; at present a spring booster is available only to particular groups, including those aged 75 and over and care home residents. It has not yet been revealed which groups would be included in a wider rollout. Another member of the JCVI told the Guardian the assumption that younger, healthy people would not be given a further dose was not unreasonable given the limitations of current vaccines and reduced disease severity in that cohort. “Boosters are really about individual protection and future-proofing for autumn disease resurgence, given global vaccine supplies,” they said. Finn said that among people who were vaccinated, an infection offered a boost to antibodies equivalent to another dose of vaccine, and could theoretically provide broader T-cell protection against non-spike proteins of the coronavirus. “I wouldn’t advise people to actively try to get infected, but if it happens – and in many people it will – the compensation for any illness or inconvenience they experience is that it should leave them in a good place immunity-wise,” he said. However, Prof Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London, cautioned that infection with the Omicron variant did not appear to produce a strong immune response, with many people being repeatedly infected at intervals of some weeks. Infections could also lead to the risk of long Covid, Altmann noted, adding that while current vaccines had limitations, boosters still increased immunity and reduced susceptibility to reinfection and serious disease, even in younger people. . According to data released on Friday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), Covid levels, while falling, remain high in the UK, with an estimated one in 35 people in the community in England having Covid in the week ending 30 April – the lowest level since the start of the year. About 1.8 million people in the UK are experiencing long Covid, about 2.8% of the population. Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick, said while the vaccine-induced immune response in younger people was more robust than in older adults, it was debatable whether further booster jabs in the former were unnecessary. “Faced with future vaccine-dodging variants and with continued uncertainty about the long-term consequences of Covid infection, it will be important to monitor the duration of protection in [younger people],” he said, adding that while vaccination did not completely stop transmission, it did reduce virus spread. “The winter months are likely to be challenging with new Covid variants as well as other respiratory infections,” he added. “While the priority is to keep the elderly and clinically vulnerable safe, it would be dangerous to ignore [younger, healthy people].” Two new forms of Omicron labelled BA.4 and BA.5 are already being closely watched in the UK following a rise in cases in South Africa, with early data suggesting they could have a growth advantage over BA.2 – the form of Omicron that is dominant in the UK. While the numbers of infections in the UK identified as BA.4 or BA.5 are low, some experts believe the UK is likely to experience a new wave of Covid – although how large this could be, and its potential impact, remains unclear. That is, in part, because the UK experienced a larger BA.2 wave and has higher levels of vaccination than South Africa, both of which may offer greater protection against infection with BA.4 and BA.5.",News/Politics,"Healthy young people in UK may never be offered another Covid jab, says expert",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/healthy-young-people-uk-may-never-offered-another-covid-jab-expert
5/6/2022,"Parmigiano Reggiano lives in my fridge all year round. It is, firmly, one of my top five essential cooking ingredients; one of my secret weapons as a cookery teacher and Italian food lover, I like to whip it out when I want to pack an umami punch. Many of you may know it as Parmesan, and buy it as that pre-grated cheese that you sprinkle on top of your pasta. Parmigiano Reggiano has been around for about 1,000 years and to preserve its authenticity and avoid imitations, the EU has given it Protected Designation of Origin status. It can only be produced in five provinces; Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena and parts of Mantua and Bologna. Producers must adhere to strict traditional methods of production. So next time you go grocery shopping, check out the packaging carefully: if it’s labelled Parmigiano Reggiano, you’re buying the real thing. Parmigiano Reggiano is available to buy grated, as shavings and in wedges. I’d strongly suggest buying it in a wedge: the cheese is always aged for at least 12 months – as part of large wheels that weigh about 40kg – and has a deeper and more intense savoury flavour than the pre-grated packets. It’s that ageing process that creates its unique texture: the crystals that form within the cheese give it a firm, almost crunchy quality. Parmigiano Reggiano is also naturally lactose-free, which is a rare thing among other cheeses. So when people tell me they’ve never taken a bite from a chunk of Parmesan, my heart skips a beat for them. They don’t know what they’re missing. The other benefit of buying it in a block? It’ll open up your world, allowing you to enjoy the cheese in dozens of ways beyond the obvious. Here are five of my favourites. Pair it with a flavour enhancerChip yours liberally into rustic chunks with an almond-shaped knife, and enjoy it in its purest form. And to accent its umami depth, there’s nothing quite like the sweet stickiness of balsamic vinegar. The treacly acidity of the vinegar brings vibrancy to the savouriness of the cheese. Enjoy it with a glass of prosecco, naturalmente. Level up your cheeseboardI can remember countless times in Italy, at the end of an enormous meal – when you think you couldn’t eat another thing – that a slab of Parmigiano Reggiano is brought out. All of a sudden, you have room for a few more bites. Although we often think of it as more of a seasoning here in the UK, it’s a fine addition to any cheeseboard (perhaps alongside creamy gorgonzola, and a soft, mild pecorino). Serve it the Italian way, with soft slices of ripe pear. What a wonderful way to end an evening. Being naturally lactose-free, adding Parmigiano Reggiano makes your cheeseboard all the more accessible, too. World-beating breadcrumbsWe all know the satisfying texture of a crunchy crumb – and the addition of Parmesan adds an unforgettable savoury edge. Have a tray of vegetables? Top it with a sprinkling of grated Parmigiano Reggiano, freshly chopped parsley and breadcrumbs before roasting in the oven. It’s fabulous, too, with chicken breast: thinly slice your chicken into escalopes, dip each slice into seasoned runny beaten egg, press and coat both sides in the crumb, and shallow fry until you get a golden finish. One more: try it as a final flourish atop a cottage pie. You’ll thank me. Garnish a saladThe beauty of Italian cuisine is that its simplicity allows you to appreciate how each ingredient complements one another. It’s why Italians do salads better than anybody else (this, by the way, is a point I would argue with anyone). So let me set the scene: on a bed of brisk, peppery rocket leaves, lay thinly sliced cured beef, and fine curls of Parmigiano Reggiano. The easiest way to achieve this is to use a vegetable peeler or cheese slicer to slice thin strips from the block. Top the whole thing generously with a bracingly sharp lemon and olive oil dressing. Don’t throw away the rindIf you’ve ever tossed out the Parmesan rind when you’ve come to the end of the block, let today be the last day. They are absolutely loaded with flavour: you can toss them into soups, stews, and pasta sauces to give them a delicious intensity. I have a collection of rinds wrapped in clingfilm, inside my fridge door: with those and a tin of tomatoes, it means I’m never far from a satisfying dinner. Just remember to clean them before usage and remove them before serving. I can guarantee you’ll never look back.

5/6/2022,"Parmigiano Reggiano is the flavour and joy of Italy. Its culture, tradition and history are a celebration of all the families that get up at one in the morning to make it – I’ve seen the hard work with my own eyes. To eat it is to have a piece of history inside your mouth. Everything I cook tastes better with Parmigiano Reggiano. It’s like the little cherries on top of a cake. Parmigiano Reggiano has been produced for nearly 1,000 years and was first made by monks. In those days, they probably had one cow and the recipe was simple. But it hasn’t changed at all: it’s still milk, salt and rennet. It’s a tradition and a skill that is passed down through generations. Kings, queens, prime ministers, ambassadors – they all love it. Every household in Italy probably has the cheese. There are mistakes you can make while using Parmigiano Reggiano, but perhaps it’s not right to call them mistakes; after all, everyone has to learn. Truthfully, you can use it any way you want to use it, as long as you enjoy it. But here are some dos and don’ts to help you along the way … Make sure your Parmigiano Reggiano is the real dealThere are many imitations on the shelves, often called something like “Italian hard cheese”, but Parmigiano Reggiano can only be made in its specific area of origin: the northern-central Italian regions of Parma, Reggio-Emilia, Modena and parts of Bologna and Mantua; and it is the only cheese that can be called Parmesan. So, when buying the cheese, look closely at the packaging for the PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) stamp of approval and the dotted rind on the cheese. This guarantees you are purchasing the authentic product, as every production stage, from the feed, to the cows, to the cooking and then packaging, is quality checked – including tapping the wheel with a hammer to listen for inconsistencies inside the cheese. Take heed of your cheese’s ageTwelve months is the minimum amount of time the cheese is aged. For me, 24 months is best. At 22-24 months, it’s crumbly and grainy – perfect for adding flavour to traditional Italian dishes. The longer the cheese is aged, the richer and more complex the flavour. Store it wiselyTo bring out the best flavour, when enjoyed uncooked always take Parmigiano Reggiano out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before eating so it’s at room temperature. Often, people will wrap the cheese with clingfilm and leave it at the bottom of the fridge and then pick it up after months. This is a big mistake people make. When keeping it in the fridge, make sure it’s not too cold and don’t leave it there for too long. And certainly, don’t freeze it – freezing ruins the cheese. Please! You might be afraid that you will run out or it will spoil if you don’t freeze, but it destroys it. It’ll still be cheese, but freezing changes the content and structure. The cheese will be screaming! You can freeze grated Parmesan, but it’s also best eaten fresh. Add Parmigiano Reggiano towards the end of your cookingIt depends what kind of recipes you use, but I almost always use it towards the end of cooking. This doesn’t mean that it has to be grated on top of dishes, though. In Italy, we try to use all the bits and pieces of ingredients. Parmigiano Reggiano is the same; when you cook with it, you can use everything, including the rind. Don’t be afraid of using Parmigiano Reggiano with fishSome people believe you can’t use cheese with fish; rubbish! You can. My God, I have so many recipes that include fish and Parmigiano Reggiano. As long as you use it with respect, it’s a celebration of whatever you’re doing. Whenever I use Parmigiano Reggiano, I can taste all of Italy and all of the cultures behind it. I recently put out a video of me cooking baked sea bass with potato and Parmigiano Reggiano. It has a little bit of butter and a little bit of sage on top – delicious! Now you know the rules, try breaking the rulesYou can use Parmigiano Reggiano on almost anything, especially when it comes to Italian cuisine. We can be very traditional in Italy; we’ll say this dish is done like this and nothing else goes with it. But that’s rubbish, there are many things that Parmesan works with. If you have pizza in Italy, you will see people use a bit of mozzarella and nothing else. But when I make pizza, I put Parmigiano Reggiano on top. If you want to have a cheesy pizza that uses one particular cheese, sure – you might not add Parmigiano Reggiano in case the flavour is too strong. But many important restaurants and pizzerias use Parmigiano Reggiano all the time.

5/6/2022,"It is two years since concern last swirled around the health of the housing market. Then, estate agents were tentatively setting up socially distanced viewings after the market was allowed to reopen part-way through the first Covd lockdown. At the time, the property firm Savills reviewed its forecast and decided it still expected house prices would “fall by around 5% to 10% in the short term”. This did not happen. The pent-up demand that had grown through lockdown was quickly stoked by stamp duty holidays across the UK. Far from falling, house prices started rising – and have not stopped since. On Friday, the UK’s biggest lender, Halifax, said prices had risen by 1.1% in April, bringing the average to a new high of £286,079. “Housing transactions and mortgage approvals remain above pre-pandemic levels and the continued growth in new buyer inquiries suggests activity will remain heightened in the short term,” said the bank’s managing director, Russell Galley. “For now, at least, despite the current economic uncertainty, the strong increases we’ve seen in house prices show little sign of abating.” Halifax’s numbers are the latest evidence that despite a pandemic, consecutive Bank of England meetings resulting in interest rate rises and a developing cost of living crisis, house prices – and activity – have remained strong. But how long can it last? Two years after it predicted a fall, this week Savills said it remained “difficult to see the trigger for a meaningful house price correction”. Other commentators appear to agree, although with caveats. “I’m not expecting there to be a crash but I’m more negative about the prospects for the market than at any time since the start of the pandemic,” said Neal Hudson, a housing market analyst at the consultancy BuiltPlace. “The risks are pretty big at the moment.” House prices have been supported by low borrowing costs, so rising mortgage rates, combined with other increases in living expenses, could tip the balance. This week’s interest rate rise came with warnings that inflation could hit 10% before the year was out and that the UK was in danger of falling into a recession. With interest rate rises the Bank’s key tool for reducing inflation, further increases in the cost of borrowing seem inevitable. “We might suddenly go from a point when house prices look perfectly reasonable to where all of a sudden they’re not,” Hudson said. “You don’t have to go up to the 15% interest rates we saw in the 80s for people to feel the same pain. We’ll see the equivalent amount of pain if we see rates go to half that.” Robert Gardner, the chief economist at Nationwide building society, said he had been surprised by the strength of the market reflected in his organisation’s recent monthly reports, given some of these factors were already in play. “The squeeze has already started,” he said. “We’ve seen that filter through in sentiment surveys earlier in the year. We know the market lags that, but it hasn’t really shown significant signs of slowing, which has been a surprise.” Nationwide’s index recorded lower growth for April than Halifax, at 0.3%, but showed the average price was up by 12.1% year on year. Gardner is expecting the market to slow, rather than crash. But a key factor will be employment. “The thing that is really important is the labour market – that’s probably the most important thing overall,” he said. “Recently the unemployment rate has fallen back to where it was before the pandemic and the number of vacancies is high so that suggests that strength [in the labour market] is going to last in the near term.” There are other factors underpinning the growth of recent months that could support the market for the rest of the year, at least. The end of the first lockdown and the government’s stamp duty holiday seemed to prompt a flood of demand from borrowers, particularly those looking to change their lifestyle. But while some thought demand was being brought forward, the early signs are that there is still appetite from would-be movers. Gardner points to recent mortgage approval figures, which, although falling to 70,700 in March, remained above the immediate pre-pandemic average of 66,700 a month. A survey of 3,000 people by Nationwide also found 38% were either considering or in the process of moving. “There’s still a strong motivation to move,” Gardner said. In fact, some workers may only now feel comfortable enough with their new working patterns to commit to a move. Gráinne Gilmore, the head of research at the property website Zoopla, said: “Some buyers will have already taken the leap, but some buyers will have been waiting to see what the final finding is for their work.” Housing demand is currently outstripping supply, with estate agents in some parts of the country reporting bidding wars among buyers. Anthony Codling, the chief executive of the property consultancy Twindig, said if prices did start to turn down there would be “a step back of supply and a step back of demand” rather than a crash. Homeowners will sit tight if they think their property will fetch less than they want, which will support prices. Commentators say there is no reason to suspect that there will be a flurry of homeowners forced to sell any time soon. While the early 1990s saw repossessions and distressed sales, the banking crisis did not result in a massive sell-off of homes. Instead, falling interest rate rises allowed people to keep paying their mortgages, and banks were encouraged to offer forbearance. Codling said the mortgage repayment holidays brought in during the pandemic suggested lenders would react in a similar way in any future downturn. For the three-quarters of borrowers who are on fixed-rate mortgages, the interest rate rises so far have not made an impact on their monthly costs. It is renters who are more stressed, and this is where the danger of a sell-off lies for Hudson. Tenants on low incomes are struggling and landlords may be hit by missed rents. “In the rental sector where demand is weak we could see landlords selling up,” he said. Outside the buy-to-let sector, if the UK goes into recession it does so at a time when mortgage holders are protected like never before. The mortgage market review that followed the banking crash brought in strict rules on lending, and put an end to 100%-plus mortgages for borrowers who did not have to show any evidence of their income. Instead, borrowers have undergone strict affordability checks and had their finances “stress-tested” to make sure they can pay a rate far in excess of the ones widely being offered by banks and building societies. Despite years of rising prices, households have not been allow to take on the excessive mortgage debts that characterised the early-2000s. “They’ve not stretched themselves, they’re not on high loan-to-income ratios,” said Hudson. “These are some of the safest borrowers there have ever been.”",Lifestyle/Money,‘The risks are pretty big’: how long can UK house prices defy gravity?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/06/how-long-can-uk-house-prices-defy-gravity
5/6/2022,"The thing about Parmigiano Reggiano is, we don’t give it enough star-status in the UK. Sure, it’s amazing when grated atop a steaming bowl of carbonara, but when does it get to play the lead role? Where is it on your cheeseboard? Because it’s us cheese lovers who have to raise this wonderfully powerful cheese above condiment status. Go against the grain and carve a chunk of Parmigiano Reggiano to sit alongside your plum chutney. Be la differenza! The next question is: what will you pair your Parmigiano Reggiano with? Will it even be a red wine? Or should you choose something else to complement the intense crumble of a richly aged Parmigiano Reggiano? Well, it actually all depends on the age of your Parmigiano Reggiano. For a 20-month-aged Parmigiano ReggianoSpending 20 months in a warehouse with hundreds of other wheels of delicious Parmigiano Reggiano sounds like a long time, but this is actually one of the younger forms of this delicious cheese, as it has to be matured for at least 12 months before it can be officially called Parmigiano Reggiano. Twenty months into the ageing process, you’ll find Parmigiano Reggiano developing earthy flavours and a mellow fruity tang, alongside a youthful yoghurty aroma and flavour that makes it so moreish. In excellent examples, you’ll find aged ham and creamy butter in the complex flavour profile, as well as acorns and chestnuts, and tart, just-ripe soft fruits – like wild mirabelles. To accent those rich, ripe, buttery flavours, let’s get sugary. Grab a bottle of off-dry white and get sipping. A kabinett riesling, such as Kendermanns or Moselland, will offer up juicy apples and quince along with a supple, full ripeness and a satisfying acidity that’ll bring out the tropical fruit warmth in the Parmigiano Reggiano without becoming cloying. If you’re off the booze, Leitz Eins Zwei alcohol-free riesling (alc vol 0.0%) packs those pretty yellow plum flavours and crisp apple aromas with zero alcohol involved. A perfect pairing for Parmigiano Reggiano of any age. For a 24-month-aged Parmigiano ReggianoAdd just four months to the ageing process and you have 24-month-aged Parmigiano Reggiano, a delicacy renowned for its balance of sweetness and unbeatable savoury tang. This cheese has an undeniable apple-like quality in both flavour and aroma, with woodland greenery and nuttiness adding depth and interest. The texture of a 24-month-aged Parmigiano Reggiano is ideal as a standout piece on a cheeseboard thanks to its combination of smooth creaminess and delicate crunch. It’s complex and rugged without becoming challenging, making it an ideal accompaniment for a fresh white wine. A bright and blossomy gavi will do just the trick, bringing fresh acidity and nuttiness into the mix for a perfect pairing. With a slightly slick mouthfeel, each sip softens the Parmigiano Reggiano’s sharper notes, and its honey-floral attributes round off the mature cheese’s lingering aromas. If you prefer to walk on the wild side, opt for a racy orange or skin-contact wine instead. The malvasia grape makes a delicious orange wine, with the best sharing a pop of clementine acidity, a burst of floral decadence and a zing of apricot lushness. For a 36-month-aged Parmigiano ReggianoAn incredible addition to any cheese platter, a 36-month-aged Parmigiano Reggiano boasts a fruity intensity and a savoury warmth that sets it far apart from its cheesy siblings. That delicate crunch we experienced in the 24-month-aged Parmigiano Reggiano has developed further into a well-established grain throughout the cheese, creating an unbeatable umami seam within the well-aged acidity of the main body of the Parmigiano Reggiano. The incredible umami complexity in a 36-month-aged Parmigiano Reggiano creates a combination of flavours that can trick your brain into tasting caramelised meat roasted over a fire. Yes, it’s time to grab a bottle of red. There’s something so satisfying about pairing a deep, fruity malbec with savoury, umami-rich food, and this 36-month-aged Parmigiano Reggiano definitely fits that bill. Grab a pinotage malbec blend from South Africa for extra thyme and rosemary aromas to really set off the Parmigiano Reggiano’s savoury warmth, such as Bruce Jack Pinotage Malbec. To tag along with the crunchy tang of those deeply developed crunchy textures in your Parmigiano Reggiano, head to Emilia-Romagna and get involved with lambrusco. Instead of the sweet, pinky-purple fizz you remember, opt for a real taste of Parmigiano Reggiano country by popping a bone-dry, super-fragrant bottle from Camillo Donati. You’ll never look back.
