4/16/2022,"Richard Moore, who has died suddenly aged 48, was an international bike racer and writer who enhanced the sports media landscape with the foundation of the Cycling Podcast, created with his fellow journalists Daniel Friebe and Lionel Birnie in 2013. The Cycling Podcast was born when Moore and Birnie were looking for work at the 2013 Tour de France, having lost a magazine writing gig shortly before it started. Offering a daily bulletin from the race, their deep knowledge, passion for the sport and contrasting presenting styles – the erudite Birnie, Friebe more intense, Moore the laid-back anchorman – made the podcast an instant hit with cycling fans. The trio had struck at the perfect moment: those were halcyon days for the sport in the UK after the magic season of 2012 when London had hosted the Olympic Games and Sir Bradley Wiggins had won the Tour de France, Chris Froome was set fair for four Tour wins in five years, and Yorkshire was about to host one of the most dramatic and popular Grands Départs the Tour de France has ever seen. By 2015, listener numbers had reached 30,000 and in 2018 the podcast received a bronze medal in the sport category of the British Podcast Awards. Birnie, Friebe and Moore turned it into a cottage industry in its own right, producing offshoots on women’s racing – the Cycling Podcast Féminin, which also won a bronze at the British Podcast Awards – gravel racing, bike tech and on the stories behind and around the Tour de France. They also branched out to cover the Giro d’Italia and the Vuelta a España, and there were popular stage shows as the three went on tour around the UK and Ireland; in addition there were books, mugs and tea towels. The show has had 48.4 million listens since its inception. Moore was born in Edinburgh, the son of Brian Moore, a management consultant, and Katherine (nee Hunter), a teacher. After studying at Stewart’s Melville college in Edinburgh, he went on to the University of Aberdeen, where he graduated in English literature and was vice-president of the wine society, or so he liked to tell those who travelled with him at the Tour de France. He caught the cycle racing bug from his father, and was Scottish junior road race champion in 1991. His career as a racing cyclist took him to international honours for Scotland at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur in 1998, while he also rode major races such as the PruTour that year, where the team wore striking kit picked out in tartan and were managed by Philippa York, then known as the cyclist Robert Millar. After giving up racing in 1999, Moore turned to journalism, writing initially as a freelance for the magazine Cycling Weekly, and then the Scotsman, for which he covered the Tour de France for the first time in 2005. In contrast to recent successes of British cyclists in the race, in that year’s Tour there was not a single Briton on the start list. The UK’s best racer, the Scot David Millar, was serving a drug ban, so Moore was reduced to playing up the Scottish connections of the English-born Italian racer Dario Cioni to get space in the paper. His first book, In Search of Robert Millar, a biography of his erstwhile team manager, was published in 2007 and was longlisted for the 2008 William Hill sports book of the year. That was followed by Heroes, Villains and Velodromes (2008), the definitive account of how British track cycling dominated the 2008 Beijing Games, and Sky’s the Limit (2011), which detailed the formation of the British squad Team Sky in 2010. He co-wrote Sir Chris Hoy’s autobiography – the pair had been Scotland teammates in Kuala Lumpur and remained close – while his other cycling books, Slaying the Badger (2011) and Etape (2014), dealt with the Tour de France, the former being turned into a successful film. He earned praise for his other, non-cycling, books, The Dirtiest Race in History: Ben Johnson, Carl Lewis and the 1988 Olympic 100m Final (2012), and a biography of Usain Bolt, The Bolt Supremacy (2015). Moore had first appeared on a podcast with Friebe and Birnie to promote The Cycling Anthology, an annual book published by Birnie – they recorded in a London pub and were barely audible over the noise of their fellow drinkers. Having then opted to produce the daily Cycling Podcast from the Tour de France, they were well aware that with the other pressures of writing up each stage they would need some incentive to ensure they stuck to it; it was Moore who made contact with the electronics company Sharp – at that time co-sponsor to the Garmin squad – and drummed up a small amount of cash, “enough to make the commitment worthwhile”, as he put it. After an earlier marriage which ended in divorce, in 2012 Moore married Virginie Pierret, with whom he had a son, Maxime; in 2020 the family moved to northern France, where Moore died the night after reporting on the Gent-Wevelgem one-day classic. In addition to his wife and son, he is survived by his father.

4/16/2022,"The last day of the dinosaurs probably began as a morning like any other. On a sandbank bounded by a river and warm wet forests in what’s now the dusty North Dakota prairies, triceratops and tyrannosaurs laid eggs, roamed, did their late Cretaceous thing. Thescelosaurs and turtles swam in the river. Pterosaurs flew overhead and furry mammalian creatures burrowed underground. On one of the most important days in Planet Earth’s history, as only David Attenborough can so portentously pronounce it, life went on in abundance. Until an asteroid bigger than Mount Everest hit what is now Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula with an explosion whose force was greater than that of a billion Hiroshima bombs. In less than two hours, the world as we never knew it was for ever changed. We don’t know exactly when the asteroid hit. But within 40 minutes, the consequences 2,000 miles away at Tanis – the name given to the Dakotan sandbank by the palaeontologists who have been digging there for a decade – were profound. Dinosaurs: The Final Day With David Attenborough (BBC One) recreates those last terrifying minutes as wildfires, earthquakes, tsunamis and seismic waves ravaged the globe and all life at Tanis was swiftly entombed in sediment. For context, this was 60m years before we pitched (or rather stood) up. And we’re seeing in real time how that’s panning out. That’s just the last half-hour of Dinosaurs: The Final Day. And it’s disturbingly prescient for something that happened 66m years ago. I found myself sloshing back and forth, much like the Norwegian fjords mysteriously did in 2011 after an earthquake hit Japan, while watching this slick, gripping and elegiac feature-length documentary. Lurching from abject despair at our our contemporary role in this history to profound awe at our ability to unearth its deep mysteries. The signature Attenborough cocktail of feelings, then. One of my scribbled notes simply reads: “We are the asteroid.” Dinosaurs: The Final Day deftly uses state-of-the-art FX and a virtual production studio, which I no more understand than the Sauron-esque eye of the Oxfordshire synchrotron, where lead palaeontologist Robert DePalma takes his astonishing finds to be scanned. The point is to transport us back to the late Cretaceous so we can see for ourselves how the dinosaurs’ last days might have been. And how Attenborough would have looked (like a fish very much in water, naturally) having his chinos sniffed by our cute furry ancestors. Edge-of-your-seat stuff for some, but for me virtual FX in nature/science documentaries tend to induce the disappointment of fake flowers: never as stirring as the real thing. More exciting is the dig at Hell Creek Formation. Here, DePalma and his team are excavating a mass dinosaur graveyard entombed in a layer of crumbly rock. Happily, DePalma has Indiana Jones levels of magnetism, and can unearth a good line with as much class as he wields his trowel (and fedora). “It’s like trying to defuse a nuclear weapon while you’re in a rainstorm,” he drawls, brushing the mass death layer. While “performing surgery on a Cretaceous fish”, he discovers tiny balls of molten rock in the fish’s gill bars. They are ejector spherules propelled into the atmosphere by the asteroid, which “last saw the light of day when they were flying through the air 66 million years ago”. In a knot of amber, he finds spherules containing a perfectly preserved particle “of the bullet that killed the dinosaurs”. The asteroid itself. Wow. In another thrilling moment of this detective story set in deep time, the team uncover what has never before been found: the body of a dinosaur killed by the effects of the asteroid’s impact. “I think we got ourselves a dinosaur!” DePalma cries as they dig a square of sediment that, to me, looks like any other square of sediment. Hours later, the fossilised leg of a thescelosaurus, skin and tissue included, emerges, looking “like a Thanksgiving turkey”. The leg’s location, entangled in the “log jam” of Tanis’s mass death layer, which is where they found the meteorite-flecked amber and spherules, is proof enough. The dinosaur died as a result of the asteroid collision. After that Earth-shattering day, sulphur ejected by the asteroid blocked all sunlight. The planet was plunged into semi-darkness for a decade. Temperatures dropped dramatically. On land, the plants died and in the seas the plankton vanished. Three quarters of all species were wiped out. “Then,” says Attenborough, “came something wonderful.” Plant life returned, and with it, some of the smallest and most resourceful creatures, including our little furry ancestors who had survived the nuclear winter in their burrows. And Attenborough hasn’t given up, either. “We are unique in our ability to learn from the distant past,” he concludes. “Now we must use that ability wisely … to protect the millions of species for whom, alongside us, this planet is home.” ",Arts/Television & radio,Dinosaurs: The Final Day With David Attenborough review – a thrilling slice of time-travelling detective work,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/15/dinosaurs-the-final-day-with-david-attenborough-review-a-thrilling-slice-of-time-travelling-detective-work
4/16/2022,"Alot can change in a week in football but for Sean Dyche the problem was a lack of change in a decade at Turf Moor. His methods were tried and tested: play 4-4-2 and finish 17th or above. Dyche was the master of keeping unfashionable Burnley in the Premier League but the faith of the players and owners ran out. Ten of the squad that beat Chelsea on the opening day of the 2017-18 season and took them to a seventh-placed finish are still at the club. Some would see it as a sign of stability but others would argue the team have not evolved in that time, when the plan rarely changed week-to-week and season-to-season. Senior players grew frustrated that areas of weakness were not addressed in recent years, leaving the squad short of depth and in need of revitalising. Players such as Phil Bardsley have been kept on, rather than being replaced. Bardsley has appeared four times in two seasons in the Premier League, and not since February 2021. Dyche has not called on him in the league this season despite naming him on the bench on 24 occasions. It spoke volumes that with Ben Mee and Nathan Collins absent through injury and suspension respectively, the 31-year-old Kevin Long was asked to make his first appearance in 14 months for the club in the recent loss to Manchester City. Loyalty to players has always been important to Dyche but without Chris Wood his limited striking options have been highlighted. Ashley Barnes joined in 2014 and has a scoring record of less than one in every five games, including no goals this season; Matej Vydra’s best season at Burnley has brought him a grand total of three goals; Jay Rodriguez hit one in 31 appearances last season, following it up with two in 26 this time; and Wout Weghorst has one in 12 since joining in January. While the defence have kept their end of the bargain with seven clean sheets, the strikers have repeatedly fallen short in recent times, another source of frustration in the team. Dyche struggled to rally the players for a fourth relegation battle in six years, securing no wins between the end of October and mid-February. The team’s predictability was becoming a problem as other clubs evolved and spent more money to improve their sides while progress was limited at Turf Moor. Despite the poor results, the style and formation were kept the same with the confidence that it would eventually come good despite evidence to the contrary, leaving players disillusioned. The blame cannot be laid purely at Dyche’s door given that he worked within set parameters. Despite the takeover by ALK Capital last year, a deal which left the club £90m worse off, the budget has remained limited. Money has been spent on Collins, Connor Roberts, Maxwel Cornet and Weghorst, who was signed as a replacement for Wood. Newcastle paid £25m for Wood but Weghorst cost less than half that and was the only January arrival despite Burnley’s struggles. Other players were targeted but the club failed to get deals over the line, much to the chagrin of many at Turf Moor, leaving them light for the battle they face. Even in 2020-21 the only first-team player to sign was the central midfielder Dale Stephens, who has been unable to become a regular. Dyche leaves Burnley four points from a safe position with eight games to go after a pitiful loss against the Championship-bound Norwich. The problems of the club were laid bare at Carrow Road, where Weghorst was taken off after 56 ineffectual minutes to be replaced by Vydra, who has scored seven league goals in three and a half seasons at the club. Unsurprisingly, Burnley did not get back into the game; they managed four shots on target against a side who have conceded 63 times this season, to leave the players dejected for the final time under Dyche. The next manager will inherit a squad in Dyche’s mould and have to reinvigorate it in a short space of time. It is unlikely the style and formation will change much but a fresh approach in the dressing room is much wanted and needed with survival on the line. Dyche’s impact will not be forgotten. Two promotions and European qualification will be the on-pitch legacy that he leaves. Away from it, helping Burnley become a relatively stable Premier League side has allowed them to invest in a new training ground and he will forever be welcome in The Royal Dyche pub in the town. Sometimes change is good but Burnley cannot stop with the one in the dugout.",Sport/Football,Burnley’s Sean Dyche era had to end but club’s changes must not stop there | Will Unwin,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/15/burnley-sean-dyche-era-had-to-end-but-changes-must-not-stop-there
4/16/2022,"There is a terrifying moment in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner where the crew of the mariner’s ship, lost at sea under a merciless sun, are visited by a mind-blowing vision: a ghost galleon containing only the figure of Death and a sad, pale woman. Alone on their putrid deck, Death and the sad, pale woman – who to be fair, probably expected something more along the lines of cabaret and a buffet – play an arbitrary game of dice for the lives of the (already dying) crew. Literary scholars have argued for centuries over the meaning of Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s poem. And while there is no hard evidence Coleridge ever intended his vision as an allegory for the state of English men’s red-ball cricket in the late Joe Root captaincy era, well, the imagination is certainly a mysterious place. As Root’s resignation brings to a close the last two years of desiccated decline – no coach, no selectors, management speak everywhere but not a drop of leadership – it is hard to avoid the sense of something equally lonely and equally doomed in his final course through that dying sea as England’s Test captain. As of Friday morning there is at least some overdue closure. That last sad, pale figure has vacated the deck, all played out after 64 matches and five difficult years. And for all concerned Root’s resignation will bring feelings of relief above all. Most obviously for Root himself, whose time as captain has been remarkable on two fronts. First, for its basic longevity. In many ways the only significant, or even noteworthy thing about Root’s captaincy was the fact he managed to do it for so long. “Root holds the record for the most number of matches and wins as England Men’s Test Captain,” was the top line from the ECB, dishing up the usual spin and puff even here. This is technically true. But then if we’re going to play that game Root also holds the record for most losses by an England captain, and by some distance. Only two men have ever lost more games as Test captain of any nation in the history of cricket. Root’s loss-ratio is higher even than the pre-modern Mike Atherton era, when the playing XI was culled from whichever 12 names the selectors could scrawl on the back of a committee room menu after a particularly gruelling lunch. The numbers only ever tell a part of the story. But they do bring us on to the second remarkable thing about Root’s England captaincy: the fact it is still apparently necessary to have a debate about whether he was any good at it or not. The short answer to this is very simple. No. He wasn’t. This has nothing to do with the fact Root was, is and will remain a nice person and a gracious competitor. It doesn’t detract from the sublime quality of his batting, where he is on another plane, arguably England’s greatest of all time given his numbers in every format and the fresh air between Root and everyone else on the same pitch against the same attacks. But captaincy is a distinct and highly complex thing, and above all a matter of getting the best out of others. Five years on, it is still hard to pick out what a Root team was meant to look like, how it planned to win, what its defining features were outside of hysterical collapses with the bat and periods of drift in the field. Blame the players by all means. But those who have been in international dressing rooms will also point to the vital role of leadership when this happens. All teams run to some extent on vibes, energy, plans that become good plans just because everyone knows it’s the plan. There were obvious details too, like captaining spin bowlers, which remained an embarrassing blind spot. The use of Jack Leach in the first Ashes Test was up there, as howlers go, with allowing Jofra Archer to bowl a career-maiming 42 overs at Mount Maunganui. None of this was malice or a lack of application. Often Root just seemed a little too gentle up close, too agreeable to do the ruthless, risky things that amount to leadership. Often he would reply to difficult questions by saying the issue was “above my pay grade”, where in reality, nothing was above his pay grade, as the highest-paid individual in the history of England cricket. This was the frustration, and indeed the paradox of Root’s longevity; the sense of a leader helplessly caught up in wider tides of change. The most bizarre discussion around his extended departure has been the insistence that England’s team is so poor, its cricket so degraded, that the captaincy has become irrelevant, that what is happening here is an existential crisis in the red-ball game, that England do not deserve to seek out a slightly better Test captain. In reality it is remarkable what a difference those fine details can make, just as the England captaincy is not some holy garland to be clutched on to in perpetuity, or passed down only to those with the right sense of officer class permanence. Frankly Matt Fisher could have got the gig for the last 17 Test matches and England wouldn’t have done any worse. At least in its sense of drift Root’s England has captured the essence of the age. But his departure was essential for other reasons too. Mainly because this arcane old code has to have consequences and jeopardy – one win in 17 has to matter – or frankly the gig is up and what we’re left with is matches that simply die away, where Ollie Robinson is playing a lap sweep as his stumps explode and an Ashes series is euthanised gratefully out of existence. As for next things, Stuart Broad would be a hugely entertaining mistake. Ben Stokes will probably get it. And who knows, a little change of energy, a shifting of the deckchairs on the ghost ship deck might just draw a few more breaths of wind in those raggedy sails.",Sport/Sport,ECB’s statistical spin hides the fact that Joe Root was sunk as England captain | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/15/joe-root-england-captain-ecb-cricket-comment
