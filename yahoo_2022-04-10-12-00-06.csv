4/10/2022,"STORY: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, one of his staunchest backers, in Kyiv on Saturday. Johnson's visit to the Ukrainian capital was not announced in advance, and comes as Russia is amassing troops in the east of the country after pulling back from the outskirts of Kyiv last week. The British leader announced on Twitter that the goal of the visit is to set out a new financial and military aid package for Ukraine against, quote, “Russia’s barbaric campaign.” JOHNSON: “I want to begin Volodymyr by saluting once again the bravery of the people of Ukraine in defying the appalling aggression that we have seen.” Earlier in the day, Zelenskiy met Austrian Chancellor Karl Mehammer, warning in a joint news conference of a tough battle ahead. “(Russian) forces are being gathered in the east and south. A large amount of forces, equipment, armed people who are preparing to occupy yet another part of our territory. This will be a tough battle."" The meetings come just a day after officials say more than 50 people, including children, were killed in a missile strike on a railway station in the Donetsk city of Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine. Many more were injured among the 4,000 said to be waiting to be evacuated away from the fighting. Ukraine said it was aiming to establish up to 10 evacuation corridors for civilians in the east. Russia's defense ministry denied responsibility, saying in a statement the missiles that struck the station were used only by Ukraine's military and that Russia's armed forces had no targets assigned in Kramatorsk on Friday. Reuters was unable to verify the details of the attack. The civilian casualties have triggered a wave of international condemnation, in particular those in the town of Bucha, just northwest of Kyiv that until last week was occupied by Russian forces. Officials have said that 360 civilians were killed. Reuters could not independently verify those figures. Rescue workers in Borodyanka, less than 40 miles northwest of Kyiv, spent Friday digging through rubble for survivors. Local resident Mariya recalled the horror to Reuters. “For 36 days people lay under the rubble and the Russians fired, not allowing people to be pulled out from under the rubble.” European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, who toured the wreckage in Bucha Friday, said on Saturday the Commission will pledge 1 billion euros to support Ukraine and countries receiving refugees fleeing the war. ""…for the European Commission that we want to pledge one billion euros.” Zelenskiy continues to demand tough sanctions on Russia from the West... ""They have to do everything to force Russia to seek peace."" Russia's invasion, which began on February 24th, has forced more than four million to flee their homes, turned cities into rubble and killed or injured thousands. Russia has denied targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarize and ""denazify"" its southern neighbor. Ukraine and Western nations have dismissed this as a baseless pretext for war. Moscow's sights are said to be set on gaining full control of Donetsk and Luhansk, the regions partly held by Russian-backed separatists since 2014.",Politics/Reuters Videos,"Zelenskiy meets leaders, braces for 'hard battle'",https://news.yahoo.com/zelenskiy-meets-leaders-braces-hard-220001631.html
4/10/2022,"A white OnlyFans model and social media influencer stabbed and killed her Black boyfriend in Miami last weekend. Now, as authorities weigh whether to bring charges against the woman, family, friends, and neighbors are torn about the circumstances surrounding the death, noting the couple had a sometimes-abusive relationship. Christian Tobechukwu “Toby” Obumseli, 27, was stabbed by his white girlfriend Courtney Clenney, a popular Instagram star two years his junior, on Sunday, April 3, at the couple’s One Paraiso luxury building in the Edgewater section of the city. The Nigerian-American was pronounced dead at a local hospital, and Clenney was questioned by police but not arrested. A video posted this week by TMZ depicts the woman standing outside the luxury apartment building covered in blood while talking to the police before being detained. Shortly after her detention she was hospitalized under the Baker Act. Clenney was under suicide watch after saying she wanted to take her own life. Florida’s Baker Act law allows police, doctors, mental health professionals, and judges to commit a person to a mental health treatment center for up to 72 hours if they show specific violent or suicidal tendencies. Her name was not released by law enforcement, but friends and family of the deceased took to social media to identify her as the blue check IG model with 2 million followers. A day after the death, she posted content on her OnlyFans page. A woman claiming to be Obumseli’s cousin wrote on Twitter and wrote, “This girl stabbed my cousin to death and got out on bail in less than a day.. @CourtneyTailor.” Later she posted a GoFundMe link titled “In Memory & Justice of Christian Toby Obumseli” that was set up by Obumseli’s brother Jeffrey Obumseli. “It is not enough to say we are shocked and hurting — We are utterly devastated,” Jeffrey wrote. “His murder leaves many unanswered questions and creates a void that can never be fixed or filled. Not even with time.” Obumseli was described as “extremely compassionate” and is said to have had an “infectious smile that could light up any room.” Set at a target goal of $100,000, the family says the funds will go to “postmortem transportation of the body, funeral arrangements, attorney fees, litigation, counseling, and bills for the family as we seek justice for our beloved brother and son.” Two days after being set up, the family is almost a quarter away from their goal. A “very active investigation” has been engaged by law enforcement, hoping to determine the motive of the assault — not ruling out self-defense on the woman’s part and noting there was a struggle between the two before the stabbing. Miami PD spokesperson said, “We know that there was a physical altercation between them before he was stabbed.” Friends of the couple said they knew the couple had a volatile relationship but say they don’t believe he was the aggressor in the relationship. Ashley Vaughn said, “We’ve seen her hit him. I’ve never seen him hit her.” “From what we’ve personally experienced between the both of them,” She continued. “We believe that Christian wouldn’t put her in a position where she would need to stab him to protect herself.” Another person who claims to know the woman tweeted, “I’m concerned nobody is mentioning his gf @CourtneyTailor is the one that did it. She gets violent when she’s angry and high on drugs. I’m concerned she got out of jail on bail. I’m concerned a white girl will get away with murdering a Black man.” I’m concerned nobody is mentioning his gf ⁦@CourtneyTailor⁩ is the one that did it. She gets violent when she’s angry and high on drugs. I’m concerned she got out of jail on bail. I’m concerned a white girl will get away with murdering a black man. https://t.co/H02qcGrgvl — Jenna Lee (@TheJennaLee_) April 6, 2022 A neighbor who could see into the couple’s apartment from his, has a very different account of Obumseli’s disposition. He said he saw him strike the woman the week before his death, saying, “I could not tell if it was open-handed or closed-handed, but he was swinging at her.” Friends say the couple moved to South Florida from Texas within the past two years, NBC 6 reports. Reports on Twitter she was a graduate of Plano East High School in Dallas. Police say they were called multiple times since January to the residence concerning domestic disturbances. Larry Handfield, the Obumseli family’s attorney, told reporters this week how their loved one’s death has affected them. “The family is devastated by the loss of life,” Handfield said. “At this point, all they’re looking for is justice.” Obumseli’s death came one week before he would have turned 28.",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,"‘Out on Bail In Less Than a Day’: Model Fatally Stabs Her Nigerian-American Boyfriend But Has Not Been Charged, Content Was Allegedly Posted to Her OnlyFans Account The Next Day",https://news.yahoo.com/bail-less-day-model-fatally-041400295.html
4/10/2022,"E-commerce giant JD.com's founder Richard Liu is the latest Chinese tech CEO to quit his public leadership role. These exits come as Beijing is cracking down on the sector, and as a slower economy crimps margins. China's class of billionaire founder-CEOs are feeling the heat. China's class of billionaire of founder-CEOs are feeling the pressure of government scrutiny. Ultra-wealthy Liu Qiangdong, also known as Richard Liu, is stepping back from his role as chief executive of JD.com, China's Amazon-like e-commerce giant. JD.com said on Thursday that Liu has left his role as CEO, but that he remains chairman of the company's board. Liu founded JD.com in 1998 — four years after Jeff Bezos founded Amazon — and has a net worth of $13.3 billion, according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. He joins a growing procession of founder-CEOs quitting public leadership roles amid a sweeping crackdown by China's government on its burgeoning technology sector. In 2020, Zhang Yiming, founder of TikTok-owner ByteDance, stepped down as CEO and subsequently from his chairman role. In 2021, Su Hua, founder of TikTok's main rival Kuaishou; and Colin Huang, founder of popular e-commerce platform Pinduoduo, all gave up their roles as CEO. In 2019, Jack Ma stepped down as chairman of JD.com's main rival Alibaba. All rank among the richest people on the planet, per Bloomberg, but even their wealth has not staved off scrutiny by Beijing. None of the departing founders have publicly cited government pressure as reasons for leaving or changing roles, but their departures all coincide with increasingly aggressive regulation and threats of breakups. ""These founders may say that they're leaving for personal reasons, but it's too much of a coincidence,"" said Naubahar Sharif, professor at the Hong Kong University of Technology and Science who researches on China's technology policies. ""The predominant driver is politics, and now these old guards need to make way for their successors."" The central government has taken aim at labor and consumer rights issues, launched antitrust probes against tech companies, and increased oversight on data security. The uncertainty has dented investor confidence and hurt company earnings. Last month, Alibaba and social-media giant Tencent both reported their slowest revenue growth on record. JD.com also posted its first annual loss in three years. JD.com and others are also firing thousands of workers. Liu has generally stayed out of the public eye since he was accused by a student of rape in 2018. US prosecutors dropped charges against him, citing insufficient evidence. The student, Liu Jingyao, subsequently filed a civil claim in the US against Richard Liu in 2019, seeking damages. Alibaba's Jack Ma has remained quiet since sparring with regulators in late 2020 over a potential public listing of one of Alibaba's subsidiaries. Pressure from Beijing means the founders may be making the only calculation available to them, said Sharif. ""Maybe their time in the sun is over? Maybe they should let someone else take the role that Beijing can work with?"" he said.
