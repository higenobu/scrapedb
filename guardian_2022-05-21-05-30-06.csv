5/21/2022,"It was during the second Sydney lockdown, in 2021, that Cass decided to unplug. “I was finding myself really anxious about the state of the world. And when I looked at the news, I was like, there’s actually nothing I can do as an individual to change anything that’s going on,” she tells Guardian Australia. “I just thought, I need to step away from the information overload of all the negativity. It’s too much.” She stopped watching the morning press conferences, stopped scrolling the headlines on her lunch break at work and unfollowed social media accounts that fed doom and gloom. Instead, she started filling her feed with things like the official Instagram page of the Cincinnati Zoo, “which has lots of baby animals!” It was, she says, one of the best decisions she ever made. “The anxiety is just not there [now],” Cass says. In the age of smartphones and social media, being completely unaware of the news of the day is a difficult feat. “I definitely am not immune to what’s going on in the world,” Cass says. “Obviously through social media I’m aware there’s an election coming up and there’s a war in Ukraine. I’m not completely oblivious. But as far as particularly around the pandemic and other really terrible stuff that’s going on, I just tune out because I think it’s better for my mental health.” Of course, the news still happens whether or not we watch it, and an informed public has long been considered critical to a functioning democracy. But Cass is one of a number of Australians who have begun avoiding the headlines in recent years. Research from the University of Canberra found that heavy news use dropped from 69% in April 2020 to 51% in January 2021, while those expressing high interest in the news fell from 64% in 2016 to 52% in 2021. Some people, like Cass, burned out on live blogs and daily death counts during the pandemic. Others have more personal reasons for switching off. Comedian and podcaster Gen Fricker stopped “actively consuming” the news during the pandemic, partly as a self-care tactic. There was, however, an added element to her decision. As a long-time media personality and former Triple J presenter who regularly had to prepare jokes and talking points about current events, Fricker had spent many years working in jobs where being across the news was mandatory. That intense level of engagement left her feeling “hollowed out”. “It was just exhausting. Especially at Triple J, you hear the news headlines every hour on the hour, and I don’t think any normal person should hear the news that much,” she says. “I think when I was in that place of having to read the news all the time, I was very, very unhappy. It didn’t make me any happier to engage with this stuff, it just made me feel more cynical and distrustful.” As soon as Fricker left her ABC job she began moving away from daily news consumption in favour of a once-weekly catch up on the big stories. She describes her current unplugged state as “smooth brain, just vibes”. But Fricker also questions the worth of being informed about certain stories. “Like, today I found out from [my boyfriend] that one of Nick Cave’s sons died. It was awful. Obviously I’m very sad for them,” she says. “But does my knowledge of that change anything? “I’ve also had stories about my own great personal tragedies written and all it did was make the situation far worse,” she adds. “So people having intimate knowledge of these things, or people thinking they have knowledge of these things, makes [it harder for] the actual real-life person going through it. It offers us no comfort. It just makes you feel far more alone and alienated at a time that’s already horrendous.” Mental health isn’t the only reason some Australians are ditching the news. For Ash Fontana, a tech investor and author who quit the news in 2006, the decision was largely a strategic move designed to help him to focus on himself. “Instead of reading the news, I can call someone in my friendship group or family every day. Instead of reading the news, I can do more work. And instead of reading the news, I can do more exercise,” he says. “It just allows you to do more of what’s important.” It has meant his sphere of interest is smaller. Fontana does still pay attention to hyper-local stories about his city – a tactic that he feels allows him to reorient his time towards that which is “local, controllable and tractable”. “I only read about things that I can actually affect, like how a local business is doing,” he says. “And then if something is up, I can walk down the road and support that local business.” Since the war in Ukraine began, however, Fontana has started reading the global news again. That’s one story he feels is “of importance to everyone, even if you can’t do anything about it right away”. Mark Pearson, a professor of journalism and social media at Griffith University, is a proponent of limiting the time we spend reading and watching the news but not switching off entirely. “[News fatigue] is certainly reported as a phenomenon by psychologists,” he says. “But news does contain important information, so we need to be informed citizens. But like all things, that should be done in moderation. We don’t need to be informed citizens 24/7 – we can tap into that as we need.” For the sake of sanity, Pearson advises being choosy with our news sources and adjusting our notification settings. “Just say you’re subscribed to five different social media platforms. Do you want them beeping at you all the time saying that a news outlet has posted an update? Probably you can do without that. It’s enough once or twice a day to pick up on some news headlines.” Cass believes she can mostly avoid the news and dip in from time to time when it’s important – for instance, in the lead-up to hitting the polls – without missing out on context or facts. “With the election, I don’t want to be an uninformed voter. So I will do my own research but I pick the time and the sources,” she says. “I’m trying to find out about actual policies rather than who’s bitching about who and who knows the unemployment rate. It’s such Mean Girls bullshit, I just can’t be bothered. But I do want to understand what the major parties at least stand for and how it’s going to impact me or my electorate.” She doesn’t feel she’s missed any big stories since making the call to scale back her news consumption, though she concedes she “was a little bit late on the Shane Warne thing”. Cass recommends refusing the news to others. “When there were hundreds of thousands of deaths in Italy, that really impacted me. Stuff like that, where if you don’t have the ability to control it or change it, then you just need to cut it from your life.” For Gen Fricker, too, stepping away from the news was a positive decision. “I feel like people are going to think I’m so stupid and indulgent, but we’ve got to do what we can to survive,” she says. “It doesn’t help me to know this stuff. And maybe it’s cowardly or whatever. But hey, cowards are happy.”",News/Media,"‘Smooth brain, just vibes’: what is life like for those who refuse the news?",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/21/smooth-brain-just-vibes-what-is-life-like-for-those-who-refuse-the-news
5/21/2022,"When you think of high-end 1980s glamour, you probably think of legendary fashion photographer Helmut Newton, even if you don’t know it. Powerful Amazonian beauties, crisp monochrome, overt eroticism, surreal props – it’s an aesthetic that’s trickled down to a thousand editorials. You probably don’t think of notoriously staid 1950s Melbourne. But it’s here that the German-born Jewish Newton arrived as a refugee in 1940, and it was here he spent years establishing himself as a fashion photographer of note before moving to Paris in the early 60s, dismissing his entire career in Australia as worthless, shutting the topic down, and generally being intriguingly secretive about his work in those Australian years. So why the big secret? A new exhibition of Newton’s life work at the Australian Jewish Museum in Melbourne (open until 29 January 2023) attempts to illuminate the mystery of his early life and work, including many recently rediscovered pieces unseen for decades. Newton’s Australian career starts, perhaps, in 1947, when he set up a photographic studio at 353 Flinders Lane – then the heart of Melbourne’s fashion industry. Just 26, he’d been stateless since 18, a working photographer since 16 or 17, and steeped in the garment trade since birth. By this time he’d become an Australian citizen and abandoned his birth name, Neustaedter, for something the Anglos wouldn’t find quite so intimidating. He had lived for some time in a detention camp in rural Victoria, detained as an “enemy alien” with many other German and Italian refugees, after being deported by the British from the first place he fled to, Singapore. He was ready to start a life. “Flinders Lane and the clothing industry is such a big part of the story for so many Melbourne Jews,” says Dr Jordana Silverstein, a historian of Australian Jewish life at Melbourne University. Her own grandfather, she says, was a tailor. “So many of us have those connections.” Melbourne’s established Jewish community did what they could to support the new arrivals. Catalogue work for local Jewish-owned clothing businesses like Rockmans kept Newton afloat. The work was dull – a far cry from his apprenticeship as a teenager with Jewish fashion photographer Yva in cutting-edge Berlin, who favoured double exposure and androgyny. But Yva was dead, and Newton’s family were far away. Newton found community with other exiles, working with photographers such as Henry Talbot and Wolfgang Sievers. “It was the heyday of the Kadimah [a Yiddish-centred Jewish community centre],” says Silverstein. “There’d be events every day. There’s theatre, there’s music. There’d been a theatre troupe that got trapped here during the war and stayed, and so Yiddish theatre is booming at this time. All through the city, it’s this real time of refugees building community and spending time together. Sitting in the parks. Finding each other.” In 1948, Newton married Australian-born actress June Browne in a Catholic ceremony. June would become his lifelong partner in life and work, and eventually an accomplished portrait photographer in her own right under the name Alice Springs. “They were a very avant-garde pair for the time,” says Kim Kelly, a model, receptionist and general assistant for Newton for most of the 1950s. Just 17 when she started the job, now almost 90, Kelly still crackles with energy. She was one of six from a sheltered Catholic family and still living with her parents. “Looking back, I was very naive.” She recalls a cast party for a play where June played Salome. “The boys were on one side or kissing and hugging and the girls are on the other side kissing and hugging … I had never experienced or considered or thought about that, because that type of life just didn’t exist openly in the 50s.” Melbourne’s fashion world however, she says, was as conservative as its sexual norms – a source of grief for Newton. “It was very stiff and very formal,” says Kelly. “He did very, very little work outside in the open, which he loved to do. So it was all in the studio, with the white paper down the walls, and the model standing in the one position and not moving. It must have been so frustrating for him – no wonder he went berserk!” Berserk? “Well, if you’ve seen the photographs that he took when he was overseas … ” I have. A female model in a man’s suit leans over a woman in an alley; Isabella Rosselini, on hands and knees, wears a saddle on her back; a busty woman poses entirely nude, hand on hip, in front of a mirror. “He was really the first major photographer to put that type of overt sexuality in high fashion,” says queer sex worker Greta Desgraves, whose mentor in the sex industry modelled for Newton in the 1970s. “He’s shooting for Vogue, and he’s shooting for Playboy, and there’s no clear line between the two. It’s all so tightly composed and controlled, with that real attention to composition – but it’ll be stuff like positioning mirrors to show arse and tits in the same picture. “You could say Helmut Newton invented pornography chic.” It’s clear Newton could never have taken his work in this direction in Australia. But there’s continuity with his Australian work, if you look for it – powerful women, interesting locations, natural light, whenever he could get them. The reason for Newton’s secrecy, I suspect, was no secret at all – he really didn’t want people to look. His distaste for his (fascinating, intermittently beautiful) early Australian work was excessive, but it was probably sincere. But Newton’s work isn’t only about him – it tells us about a whole community of artists, models, workers and refugees. And, in the hands of the Jewish Museum, it shows us the creativity and tenacity of Jewish communities across the diaspora.

5/21/2022,"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. Peter Beaumont charted the high-profile siege of Mariupol, the key southern port city that – eventually – became a victory for the Kremlin, leaving a city in ruins and perhaps thousands of civilians dead. The battle for Mariupol came to define one of the most brutal episodes in Russia’s war against Ukraine. It was one of the first major cities to be encircled and was viewed as one of the Kremlin’s key objectives both for its economic importance and as a stepping stone in building a land bridge from Russia to Russian-occupied Crimea. This week, Pjotr Sauer reported claims by Moscow that more than 1,700 Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the Azovstal steelworks “surrendered” and had been taken to Russian-held territory. Russia said more than 900 of the soldiers had been sent to a former prison colony. It is not clear how many soldiers remain inside the plant, and Ukraine has not commented on the evacuation of the soldiers since Tuesday. The deputy commander of the Azov regiment, Capt Svyatoslav Palamar, released a video on Thursday evening in which he said he had not surrendered and remained in the steelworks. “The operation is continuing. I can’t give more information now,” Palamar said. He did not say how many other fighters were with him. Inside Russia, the fate of the evacuated soldiers is being decided. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the combatants would be treated in line with international norms for prisoners of war, though several senior Russian politicians demanded they be put on trial and one even called for their execution. Daniel Boffey wrote a powerful dispatch from Kutuzivka in north-east Ukraine detailing the life spent underground of eight-year-old Tymofiy Seidov, the last child remaining in his village. He spends much of his time drawing at a little table, dimly illuminated from above by a tiny LED light, in the corner of the otherwise almost completely dark 40-by-five-metre basement he shares with 23 others including his mum, aunt and grandmother. Tanks feature a lot in his pictures. The day of Boffey’s visit, he is working on some Dalek-like monsters that he says he remembers from a cartoon he watched on YouTube before the war. He also draws happier scenes, sometimes, of houses under the sun and rainbows in the sky. But the world outside has been out of bounds to him for months. Tymofiy’s mum, Rita, says: “Tymofiy is calm today but during the heavy fighting he would become hysterical.” Defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh reported how western military sources believe Vladimir Putin has become personally involved in the war, making decisions “at the level of a colonel or brigadier”. The sources said they believed the Russian president was making tactical decisions in the east, helping determine the movement of forces in the Donbas, where last week his invading forces suffered a bloody defeat as they repeatedly tried to cross a strategic river in the east of Ukraine. The attempt to encircle Ukrainian forces resulted in nearly 500 killed and the loss of more than 70 armoured vehicles in the disastrous attempt to cross the Siverski Donets river in broad daylight. Ben Barry, a former brigadier in the British army and a land warfare expert at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, said: “A head of government should have better things to do than make military decisions. They should be setting the political strategy rather than getting bogged down in day-to-day activity”. Prof Sir Lawrence Freedman from King’s College London said he judged the claim about Putin’s level of involvement to be plausible: “Putin has chased the military operation, first by giving very little notice he would launch an attack and then pushing hard for quick wins. That’s particularly been the problem with the second stage of the war, in the Donbas.” This week Sabbagh also looked at Russia’s claims it was using laser warfare in Ukraine. As one expert he quoted put it: “I believe this is just a lot of hype”. As Russia continues to hide the scale of its losses in Ukraine, more and more information has leaked out, angering the families of Russian soldiers and discouraging even previous supporters of the invasion, write Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer. “I look at my government totally different since the war started,” said Tatyana Efremenko, 39, whose son Nikita Efremenko was a conscript on the Moskva missile cruiser when it was sunk in a Ukrainian missile strike a month ago. She is still searching for her son. “There are some very harsh things I would like to say about our leadership, but maybe best if I don’t because they would put me in prison for it.” Kyiv has said that it has the remains of thousands of Russian soldiers but Moscow won’t accept them because that would force it to admit the high death toll in the war. Criticism has even reached Russian state television. In a rare condemnation of Kremlin policy on a political talk show, defence columnist Mikhail Khodaryonok suggested that the government was in denial about the war and the chance for victory against highly motivated Ukrainian forces armed by the west. “The main deficiency of our military-political position is that, in a way, we are in full geopolitical isolation and that, however much we would hate to admit this, virtually the entire world is against us,” he said. “And it’s that situation we need to escape.” US president Joe Biden promised full support for the Finnish and Swedish applications to join what he called a “revived Nato”, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg warmly welcomed them and Finland’s president Sauli Niinistö said its armed forces were one of the strongest in Europe, but one crucial problem remains: Turkey is not happy. “We have told allies that we will say no to Finland and Sweden’s Nato membership,” president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told Turkish students this week. All 30 alliance members of Nato have to approve the acceptance of a new ally. Diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour explored the reasons behind Erdoğan’s repeated opposition, which could tangle Nato up in knots for months. On Monday, Erdoğan made two key demands: that Finland and Sweden end their supposed support for the Kurdish Workers’ party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation, and that they lift their ban on arms exports imposed in October 2019 after the Turkish incursion in northern Syria. The Nordic political class initially appeared sceptical about Erdoğan’s seriousness. But that assessment is changing. Jonathan Eyal, the associate director of the Rusi thinktank, said Erdoğan “lives on the edge and operates through brinkmanship”. The Turkish president, Eyal noted, “has domestic reasons to be standing up to America. The economy is in tatters and his popularity is at an all-time low.” With inflation at 66.9% and facing elections next summer, there is no harm galvanising the nationalist vote, but that is not to say Erdoğan’s complaints are entirely synthetic. The Guardian asked Swedish and Finnish readers to share their thoughts on what Nato membership would mean for them, and how they felt about the Russia-Ukraine war. Here’s what they said.",News/World news,What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week?

5/21/2022,"Ngai gar kulai upasian, ngai kuiku mabaigal matha muiya muingu, nga ka thanumun ya i kulai mulie kie. Ngai gar lak upasian kowa kuiku mabiag einabie lugngu thana ka ngulpun wakai waiyak. Ngai mina kaima eso, Awa Waubin. (Before I speak, I pay my respects in silence, speaking with my ancestors, acknowledging them. I pay my respects to the Rightful Owners of this land who will give us guidance. I express gratitude to Uncle Waubin for teaching me.) I am sitting forward, in nautical terms, looking astern at my awa, who is guiding us through reefs and straits on a moonless night. Above him are stars like phosphorescence in the squid-ink sky. Around his silhouette I see phosphorescence like stars in our small dinghy’s wake. I’m a young man excited to be going night-spearing for kaiyar, the painted crayfish. The 14-foot aluminium dinghy is tiller-steer. No frills: no centre consoles, steering wheels or rod-holding rigs. No fancy depth sounder or GPS. Like most small boats in the Torres Strait Islands, my awa’s boat is set up for hunting, fishing and transport. My awa, my uncle, is a quiet man. When he speaks, you must listen. Concentrate. Not only because the effort will yield lustrous pearls of wisdom but also because of the way he speaks – quiet, humble, without sparkle but valuable nonetheless. In my culture, the uncle-nephew relationship is vital to the boy becoming a good and capable man. An uncle is obliged to teach the nephew the ways of the world and is respected for this like a father. Before we launched the boat at Bach Beach on Waiben, Awa explained the journey ahead. We discussed the tides and the moon phase, and he described the path through the channel between Ngarupai and Muralag. We would be navigating through Karaureg lands and waters, where we can trace our ancestry back well before English names – Thursday Island, Horn Island, Prince of Wales Island – were imposed over our Country. After travelling for almost an hour, the roar of the two-stroke motor hushes to a drone and the wind falls away from my back. An orange glow outlines Awa’s silhouette as he draws on a cigarette. He waves with his free arm towards the outline of nearby islands, blacker than the night. I understand that he is teaching me, checking that I have noticed a waypoint he spoke of, marked by the shape of the land beneath the Southern Cross. The waypoint indicates that we are nearing the passage to our destination. A place only recently named Possession Island. Possession Island, the place I went hunting for kaiyar as a young man 20 years ago, was named by the then Lieutenant James Cook in August 1770. The act of naming the island “Possession” demonstrates the attitude Australia’s white forefathers had towards land ownership, devoid of connection to the life force of Country – the generations of people, plants and animals; their spirits and stories sustained from that. It is an attitude that continues in modern Australia and contributes to widening inequality and the worsening global climate crisis. For my people, ownership of the land is as much about the land’s ownership of us. The land and sea are not possessions to be used, unsustainably. The land and sea are for us to care for, collectively, for the generations of our children to come. For without our lands and seas – without the waru (turtles) and dhangal (dugong) eating the sea-grass and in turn feeding us; without the baizam (sharks) patrolling the reefs and maintaining balance; without the rugoebaw (sweet potato) planted as the winds and stars guide; without honouring our totems and heeding their lessons about the circle of life – we know, from more than 60 millennia of experience, that we would be doomed. For the Gudang Yadhaykenu Aboriginal First Nation on the mainland closest to the Torres Strait Islands, this island is not Possession Island: it is Thunada. For my people of the Kaurareg Nation, the same island is named Bedanug during the north-west winds we call kuki, and Thuined during sager, the south-east trade winds. The multiple names and the multiple peoples associated with the island are the opposite of the western concept of possession. They reflect a sharing and generous culture. They reflect collective custodianship and sustainability versus singular exploitation. Cook’s ship, HMS Endeavour, and his crew were observed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as they sailed up the east coast of Australia. Both the peoples of the mainland and the islands believed the white sailors were the spirits of the dead returned; they were markai in Kalaw Lagaw Ya, the language of the Kaurareg. First Nations warned each other about these strange ghosts blown in on low-flying clouds. We used message sticks and smoke signals, as effective as Royal Mail. Cook and his crew were largely ignored in the earliest interactions: we had no interest in trade or diplomacy with the intruders. We had everything we needed – we had and we maintained an abundance of life. Aboriginal people went about peaceful lives as we had for millennia, as the British explorer went about his business, foolishly believing he was discovering our lands, as though we were not there. According to official Australian history, on 22 August 1770, one of Cook’s final acts before sailing away from our great continent through Kaurareg lands was to hold a brief ceremony on Thuined to proclaim possession of the entire east coast for Britain. Well, at least this is Cook’s account, written in his journal and reported to his masters back in England. We learned early that white ghosts can lie. Like any sovereign peoples, the visitation of such strangers – ghosts, intruders or otherwise – was recorded and maintained as a significant event in our historical archives. No other culture on Earth has recorded significant geological events from ice ages ago and carried them accurately from generation to generation to this very day. Similarly, First Nations peoples passed on historical events and lessons orally through songs and stories, and through art. Our historical archives, written or not, should be respected and valued. My ancestors met their obligations to teach my Elders, who are meeting their obligation to teach the following generation as my awa met his obligation to teach me. And we have a different story to Cook’s. From the words of our Elders, as told by the Kaurareg warriors who witnessed the markai – Cook, briefly floating offshore, never planting British flag on Thuiden because our warriors may well have killed him – the foundations of Australia remain contested. This Kaurareg understanding of Australia’s shaky foundations is just one of many stories known to First Nations that differ from the British version. After all, we know that Cook had secret orders from the King to gain our consent before claiming possession, but he declared our land for the King without negotiation. We are a nation that continues to be without a Treaty, and in the late 19th century First Nations representatives weren’t included in the constitutional conventions that founded the Australian federation. We are yet to be constitutionally recognised and empowered as distinct peoples – as distinct as and certainly more legitimate than the colonies that became the Australian states. These are just a few examples that challenge Australia’s foundations. Worse are the crimes against our humanity – the genocide and slavery committed by Australia’s governments right up to the latter half of the 20th century and to this day through mass incarceration, harmful policies and prejudice. The truths that challenge the foundations of this nation do not make me deny Australians their identity because, in part, I would be denying my own. I am as Australian as I am Kaurareg, Kalkalgal and Erubumle. Nor do I deny that the sovereignty of the crown, the authority of the Australian government, is real. The point that I am bringing us to is where truths collide and where truths can possibly come together. As Wiradjuri and Wailwan lawyer and writer Teela Reid wrote in 2020 for Griffith Review: it is time to show up for the reckoning. In many ways, Australian people have been demonstrating a willingness to show up for the reckoning. As I carried the sacred Uluru Statement from the Heart canvas across the nation soon after its creation in May 2017, mobilising the people’s movement in support of its proposal for a Voice to Parliament, I saw the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags flying alongside the Australian flag in schools, offices and government buildings – as can be expected today – but also in the most unlikely of places, including in the front yards of homes in small rural towns where I rarely saw another Blackfulla. It’s no myth that most Australians accept that each of these flags tells a story of our collective identity. Each of these flags represents our country. Each represents perspectives that, when brought together, can strengthen our identity and our ability to deal with the global challenges before us. Though most Australians accept the importance of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander identities, only one flag, the flag with the British union jack on it, is truly represented in parliament. Changing this structural inequity so that First Nations sovereignty is recognised and truly heard is where I believe the reckoning begins. Cook failed to reckon with the reality of First Nations sovereignty. The governors of the former colonies and their masters in their British homelands failed too. The forefathers of the federation of Australia had the opportunity to right these wrongs, but they chose to “smooth the dying pillow” of a “dying race”, as they described us, going further by enacting the White Australia policy in one of the first acts of the Australian parliament. Yet as each subsequent Australian government tried to kill us off, either blatantly or through gross negligence, we recovered and modernised First Nations identities. And here we are, flying our colours, still calling for dignity, respect and recognition. The Uluru Statement provides a roadmap to the reckoning. It is a referendum to enshrine our Voice – our flags, our identities, our rightful place – in the centre of all levels of decision-making, and I strongly believe we can succeed. Numerous polls and reports to government indicate the willingness of the Australian people to show up for a reckoning of our past at a Voice referendum. While the sentiment of the Australian people is with us, governments have obfuscated. The federal government has reports from the Referendum Council from 2017, the 2018 joint select committee on constitutional recognition relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and the 2021 Indigenous Voice Co-design Final Report, and they all recommend constitutional enshrinement of a First Nations Voice. One does not need to look far to see that in the real world, outside the Canberra bubble, the truths of the foundations of Australia have already collided, and the truth of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ place in this country – both symbolically and constitutionally – is bursting through as the strongest and most desired reform to the Australian identity. Where once there was only one flag flying, we now see three. The challenges ahead of us – climate change, an ongoing pandemic, growing inequality and the failure of neoliberal economics – are like a storm on the horizon. We must pull our ship together, prepare the vessel and the crew, and look to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elders to guide us to peaceful waters. Australia can gain much from the wisdom and accountability we will bring to parliament. I asked Kaurareg Elder Awa Waubin to provide the final words for this essay. I asked if he would share some of the political wisdom that ensured a thriving Kaurareg Nation on small rocky islands in the brilliantly turquoise strait between two giant lands. His words demonstrate the distance we must close – the difference in ideals about the possession of land and respect for all living things, including Country, that must face reckoning. Awa Waubin said, ‘My bala, it is always important for us to remember that what matters in cultural diplomacy is not the borderlines that colonisation imposed on us. What matters is the respect for our bloodlines and connections to Country.’ This is an edited extract from Griffith Review 76: Acts of Reckoning, edited by Ashley Hay with contributing editor Teela Reid, out now",News/Australia news,We learnt early that white ghosts can lie.

5/21/2022,"There will be plenty of time for postmortems of election campaigns after Saturday night. As the clock winds down to the closing of the polls, I’ve been processing the sum of the past three years. Back in the middle of 2020, at the end of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, I had a conversation with Scott Morrison about a verse from the prophet Isaiah. Specifically, Isaiah 58:12. “Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins, and will raise up the age-old foundations; you will be called repairer of broken walls, restorer of streets with dwellings.” Morrison told me he happened upon this verse during the catastrophic summer bushfires six months earlier – a crisis he fumbled in full public view. I was interested in what it meant to him. Morrison had referenced it during a Zoom prayer group session that later surfaced online. In the prayer group, the prime minister had categorised the verse as a “prophecy over our nation”. He told fellow believers during that session that leading a nation during a pandemic was like when Moses looked out to sea and held up his staff – a moment requiring great faith and righteous self belief. When I met him at the beginning of July in his office in Canberra, Morrison told me Isaiah 58:12 resonated with him because it spoke of recovery after a crisis, be it a bushfire or a pandemic. The verse actually has meaning on two levels. It’s a reference to the resilience of humans and the strength of humans fortunate enough to be blessed by God’s will. But in our conversation, Morrison didn’t want to elaborate beyond the obvious. The verse had spoken to him because “we are rebuilding”. I’ve thought of the Morrison of Isaiah several times over this past week as the prime minister, Australia’s self-declared bulldozer, has wrestled with the idea that he can or should or might change – a whimsically self-serving notion the prime minister projected into the final week of the 2022 election during an ears-pinned-back effort to change the campaign conversation. Back when I was bugging him about Isaiah, Morrison was at the height of his prime ministership, because at that time, he governed as if power was actually about something. A purpose was found. He’d gathered the premiers and the country’s brightest officials and public health experts to manage the most serious pandemic in a century. It’s true the premiers saved Morrison from himself on more than one occasion. But it is also true in that first six months the prime minister did what the moment required, funnelling support out the door to protect lives and livelihoods – something a more ideological Liberal prime minister would have struggled to do. Morrison now characterises that period as him bulldozing in the national interest. But Morrison wasn’t bulldozing, actually. I was there. I watched him carefully. He was building. Morrison assumed the weight of the crisis on his watch. People in the room with him at the time say he dialled his political filter down and allowed his technocratic sensibility to guide much of the decision making. The balance of power within the federation also imposed an important automatic stabiliser on Morrison’s temperament. The prime minister had to collaborate within the federation to get anything done, and that power-sharing reality impeded his hard-wired tendency to ride roughshod. It’s been a different dynamic inside the Morrison cabinet, given colleagues serve at the prime minister’s pleasure. It’s one of the quirks of politics that your strength can also be a weakness. Morrison needed all his powers of implacable self-direction to win the election in 2019 that all his colleagues believed he would lose, and perhaps those powers will save the Coalition again on Saturday night. This is a difficult election for Labor to win, so that is certainly not impossible. But whatever the final result, win, lose or draw, Morrison is now weighted heavily with negative voter perceptions of arrogance and alpha-male entitlement. Morrison’s obduracy is too fixed and front-loaded to conceal, and it hasn’t just cost him in terms of voter approval. This quality has been a substantive problem for Morrison as a leader, and that’s created measurable problems for the country. If you believe you are right all or most of the time, and you lack a diversity of input around you, if you lack people in your life who care enough about you to tell you when you are wrong, this can lead to poor decision making. Here are four standout examples. Morrison was wrong when he characterised a federal anti-corruption body as a “fringe issue” – meaning an issue that wouldn’t switch any votes. Saturday night will prove the prime minister wrong, even if all of the teal independents ultimately fall short of gaining a seat. If Morrison believes we live in an age where democracy is on the line (and he says that reasonably frequently) he should have prioritised integrity institutions to strengthen it. Morrison was also wrong when he tried to manoeuvre his way out of parliament’s #MeToo moment instead of understanding that the women of Australia needed him to listen and learn. He has managed to coax some of the women who parted ways with him in 2021 back to the fold, but some women he lost during that period will make a point of never voting for him, or any government he is part of. Morrison was right to set the Coalition on the path of unwinding the damage created when Tony Abbott invented a carbon tax to win an election. After a decade of weaponised lying, executing a climate policy pivot was always going to be difficult for him to achieve. But this could have been an epochal shift, and it wasn’t; he could have insisted it was meaningful, and he didn’t. It was a choice to come up well short and hope our allies and Australian voters wouldn’t notice. And as correct as Morrison is to observe we live in dangerous times, and consider what Australia might need to do to safeguard our national interest, the prime minister was wrong – more than wrong, he was reckless – to weaponise national security for domestic political purposes. As well as the prime minister’s obduracy, there’s also the disconcerting element of constant calculation, staging and performance. Morrison used to wear chinos and baseball caps to be more relatable. Now he wears dark, well-cut suits, because that fits his current prime ministerial character – Australia’s strong leader who may not be popular but is nonetheless worthy. I’m sure Morrison feels personally offended when his prime ministerial pageantry is remarked upon; in fact, I’ve seen him take offence. I’m sure he would feel that element of commentary is gratuitous because the various characters Morrison projects are always fragments of himself. I also understand why Morrison would feel frustrated by the banality trap of public life – where winning elections and dominating or distracting disrupters, be they opponents or journalists, involves an element of chook feeding or vaudeville. But rather than resist the banality trap, he leans in. Morrison has spent a prime ministership creating and curating images and impressions that speak to his messaging or the character he is currently projecting. But occasionally art intersects uncomfortably with life. The relentless performance art of the Morrison prime ministership ultimately collided with a small boy on a playing field in Tasmania in the final week of this election campaign. Fortunately the young boy wasn’t seriously injured. He could have been. I’m not sure how many voters felt that particular collision at a deep level. But I did, witnessing it, and the more I replayed the moment, the worse it got. Mine wasn’t a sensation of referred maternal anxiety (although I confess there was a bit of that). It was the palpable sense of a whole ecosystem being out of kilter – politics and the media chasing the sugar rush of untethered politics. It felt like insanity chasing itself. I’ve felt those moments too often in this campaign. I don’t know if Australian voters will vote for a reset on Saturday or not. But I know the country needs one – and that includes some sober thinking in my profession as well.",News/Australia news,"After relentless performance art of Morrison’s reign, Australia needs a reset | Katharine Murphy",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/21/after-the-relentless-performance-art-of-morrisons-reign-australia-needs-a-reset
5/21/2022,"There’s not much to Yarras, a suburb on the scenic Hastings River inland of New South Wales’ mid-north coast. An hour’s drive west of Port Macquarie, and with a population of 65, the landscape around Yarras is dominated by farmland. To find a pub or general store you’ll need to travel 15 minutes down the Oxley Highway to the next village, Long Flat. What Yarras does have, though, is the unenviable record of being the rainiest location in Australia this year. Meteorologists have said it was an “exceptionally wet start to the year” in NSW and Queensland – and Yarras recorded 121 days of rain by 15 May, meaning only 14 days of the year have been dry. That’s a month’s worth of rainy days more than Sydney, which in 2022 has had 90 days of rain, ahead of Brisbane and Darwin with 70 days each. The Bureau of Meteorology defines rainy days as ones which recorded at least 0.2mm of rain. Yarras resident Michael Prott has confronted a revolving door of challenges over the past three years from bushfires to drought, followed by Covid and now downpours and floods. Working as a carpenter, subcontractor and labourer, he’s only picked up eight days of work over the past two months, and an attempt to diversify his income didn’t go to plan. “We launched a kayaking and paddle tours business – Moon River paddle – at the start of this year and we were only able to run one paddle in the entire season,” Prott says. Cattle farmer Phillip Morton lives in the next valley over from Yarras in Rollands Plains. When there was a rare break in the rain a few weeks ago, Morton planted winter feed for his livestock. But a fortnight of persistent rainfall rotted every seed he’d planted, resulting in $5,000 worth of damage. “I hope I don’t sound like a whinging farmer,” he says. “It’s better than drought but I’d like to see a bit more scattering of the rain.” Of the 10 places in Australia with the most rainy days this year, eight were in NSW. Yarras’s 121 days of rain in 2022 puts it just outside the top five for rainiest starts to a year, a list dominated by locations in the tropics. Lockhart River had only six days without rain by 15 May in 1977. Ben Domensino, a meteorologist from Weatherzone, says Sydney reached its annual average rainfall before Easter this year – the earliest date on record. Brisbane had one of its top three or four wettest starts to a year on record. Brisbane has been the wettest capital city this year, with 1060mm of rain, ahead of Darwin’s 1013mm and Sydney’s 967mm. While Perth and Adelaide are yet to record 100mm. “It’s been an exceptionally wet start to the year with persistent rain but also some very big rain events,” Domensino says. “Some of the biggest anomalies that we’ve seen have been on the eastern side of the Great Dividing Range in NSW and south-east Queensland. “[In Sydney] the dams are full and the ground is still completely saturated.” The heavy downpours have sparked anxiety for those whose livelihoods depend on the weather. Working as a recruiter for a Sydney construction company, Jose Dominguez says the first question people ask him is whether they’ll be working outside. “This year it’s been raining a lot and when you are paying rent or you have kids, it’s tough when you don’t have secure work,” he says. “As a company we try to help people as much as we can but sometimes jobs depend on the weather and when it’s raining it affects everyone.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But the wet weather isn’t looking like it will let up soon. Domensino says many locations in Australia will see historic levels of rainfall this year. He says La Niña is still lingering over the Pacific Ocean and on the other side of Australia, a negative Indian Ocean Dipole is starting to develop. “That will mean that we’re about to [get] more moisture coming across the Indian Ocean over the next three to six months,” Domensino says. “That is likely to cause more above average rainfall over large areas of Australia in winter and spring.”",News/Australia news,Australia’s rainiest place: the tiny NSW town has had just 14 dry days this year,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/21/australias-rainiest-place-the-tiny-nsw-town-has-had-just-14-dry-days-this-year
5/21/2022,"Cheryl Hawkett applied to access public housing in 2015. She was living in the rural Victorian town of Moe, in a bedsit so small and cramped “you couldn’t really swing a cat in it”. Her doctor wrote a letter to accompany the application, arguing that her housing situation was detrimental to her health. She was grappling with serious anxiety and depression at the time, which culminated in a hospital stay under the care of a psychiatrist. Hawkett was 68 when she put in the application. She’s now 75, and only just this month moved into a public housing unit in Lang Lang. In the interim seven years, Hawkett subsisted on the aged pension, hopping from private rental to private rental, “just wherever I could get something cheap”, moving to Queensland after a few years and, when her health deteriorated, trying to share with a friend – “but that didn’t work out”. Hawkett had received assistance with the housing application process from the Housing for the Aged Action Group (HAAG), and it was HAAG who eventually tracked her down to the isolated caravan park in the Gold Coast hinterland where she was living to let her know she had been offered a house. “Because I moved and changed my phone number and everything, I never thought to ring the department and update everything. It had been going on for so long I thought I’d never get anything, so why bother?” Hawkett told Guardian Australia. Hawkett is far from alone in enduring a multiyear wait for housing. The waitlist for public and community housing in Victoria has ballooned in the past five years, from 35,392 in June 2017 to 54,945 in March this year – an increase of 55%. The increase has been almost entirely in the area of priority need, with 18,574 households added to the priority list in that time. Of those on the priority list, 6,663 households, or 22%, joined since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Analysis by Duncan Rouch, a researcher affiliated with the Victorian Greens’ housing and homelessness working group, suggests the current total waitlist equates to approximately 119,350 people at a conservative estimate. Housing insecurity has been a key issue for voters in the lead-up to the federal election, but policy responses from the major parties on a federal level have been mixed. The federal Labor party has pledged to build 30,000 new social and affordable housing properties nationally over five years, if elected, and to develop a national housing and homelessness plan. A federal strategy on housing to guide the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement, which governs how the states and territories spend the $1.6bn in federal funds set aside for housing, has been a key ask from housing advocates for years. The federal Liberal party’s housing policies have focused on home ownership, including its New Home Guarantee scheme and HomeBuilder programs, and its recent controversial proposal to allow first homebuyers to access their superannuation for a housing deposit. Liberal party ministers, including the prime minister, Scott Morrison, have frequently said social housing is a matter for state and local governments. In 2020, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, announced an ambitious infrastructure program to increase state housing stock, committing to providing 12,000 social and affordable homes as part of a “big build” to help address the housing crisis and revitalise the economy. Elements of the big build have been thrown into uncertainty this week, though, with Metricon, one of the companies contracted to deliver and maintain the housing, fending off rumours of impending collapse amid inflationary pressures in the construction industry. In a statement to Guardian Australia, the Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, said Metricon was one of several partners in the housing program “and this unprecedented program of work is on track”. Samantha Ratnam, the leader of the Victorian Greens, said the housing build was “an important and welcome first step” but it didn’t go far enough. “The crisis is just getting worse,” Ratnam said. “The answer to this is to build more public housing urgently, and it has to go much faster and to a much bigger scale than what the government has already committed to.” Ratnam said she was concerned the state government had shifted towards an essentially privatised model. “Community housing has an important place in affordable housing, particularly with groups within the population,” Ratnam said. “But if the state government puts all its stock in the community housing model, and then abandons public housing, it won’t go anywhere near building the number of houses, as soon as we need them to be built, to address the crisis.” A Victorian Government spokesperson said in a statement: “The Big Housing Build is on track and continuing to ramp up, with more than 6,000 homes already started, and 1,300 of those already complete.” To Hawkett, though, it hasn’t felt like politicians have been looking out for people like her at all. “I don’t think they live up to all their promises once they get elected. The government just doesn’t seem to care about people like us that can’t work and rely on the pension which, really, when you think about it, it’s not very much at all,” she said. “You meet a lot of people my age and they’ve been on the waiting list for so long, they think they’re never going to get anything. I’m so grateful that I finally got a call and they tracked me down somehow and said that I was offered a unit. But I just feel sorry that there’s so many people out there that have just got nothing.” Do you have a story?

5/21/2022,"Australians are heading to the polls to decide the make-up of the next government. As you prepare to cast your vote, here is everything you need to know. The 2022 Australian federal election is on Saturday 21 May. You can vote at any polling place between 8am and 6pm in your state or territory. Polling places are located around your community – normally in schools, church halls and public buildings. You can find your nearest polling place on the Australian Electoral Commission website. At this election, extra provision has been made to ensure those affected by the recent floods in Queensland and New South Wales, and people affected by Covid are not disenfranchised. For more information check our voters’ guide. On Wednesday the AEC announced it won’t have as many polling places open as it had planned, because of a lack of staff in some regional areas. The list of polling places impacted will be small, the AEC said, but make sure you check your nearest voting booth is open before you head out to vote. To vote on Saturday you’re going to need to know which seat you live in and where your local polling booths are. Good thing the AEC has you covered. If you’re unsure, you can check which electorate you’re voting in here. Don’t worry if you aren’t in the area on Saturday, you can still cast your vote at any polling booth. Speaking of seats, there are some particularly interesting ones to watch this year. With more independents in the field, retirements of sitting members and minor parties joining the fray, previously safe seats are less predictable. To form a majority government Labor needs to gain at least seven seats while the Coalition must offset any losses with gains elsewhere to stay in power. In Queensland, the LNP’s hold on the seat of Brisbane is being threatened by both Labor and the Greens, and in the central seat of Flynn, the retirement of popular LNP MP Ken O’Dowd means One Nation and the United Australia party will have a big influence on Saturday. In NSW both Labor and the Liberals are confident of picking up seats off each other. Lindsay, in Sydney’s west, has consistently swung with the winner for 13 of the past 14 elections. The Liberal incumbent, Melissa McIntosh, holds the seat with a 5% margin but Labor’s Trevor Ross is hoping to flip it red. In Victoria, there’s a showdown between teal independents and the Liberal party. Monique Ryan is trying to oust the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in Kooyong and former journalist Zoe Daniel is up against Liberal Tim Wilson in Goldstein. There is also a close contest in Chisholm, which Liberal Gladys Liu won in 2019 with a slim 1,100 votes. She needs to keep every single one of them to stop Labor’s candidate Carina Garland snagging it. And in Tasmania, the Liberal-held seat of Bass is under threat from Labor. The Liberal MP, Bridget Archer, won the seat in 2019 by just 600 votes. She’s been popular in the electorate, but that doens’t mean she can fend off former member Ross Hart. This week the Guardian Essential poll showed the race was tightening. On Wednesday Labor held a two-point lead in the two-party-preferred option, sitting on 48% and the Coalition on 46%. Undecided voters made up 7%. Labor has led the polls since the beginning of the campaign – but the Coalition seems to be closing in. Two weeks ago Labor was ahead of the Coalition 49% to 45% with 6% undecided. The most recent Newspoll, which is commissioned by the Australian and conducted by YouGov, also has Labor ahead, predicting there would be a +5.53 swing towards the ALP if the election was held today. On Tuesday the Resolve Strategic survey, which is commissioned by the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, showed Labor’s primary vote had also slipped from 34% to 31% over the last two weeks. In the same time, the Coalition made small gains, going from 33% to 34%. You can read more on the latest Essential poll from political editor Katharine Murphy here. It’s a good question. Last time around all of the major polls predicted a Labor win and we know how that turned out. But after Scott Morrison’s shock win in 2019 polling companies introduced new techniques to try to improve accuracy. We won’t have to wait long to see if that has worked. Elias Visontay has more on how polls have changed. Australian citizens vote for their local members of parliament in the House of Representatives and their state Senate representatives via a preferential voting system. In close contests, preferences could prove crucial to deciding which candidate is elected so it’s important to understand how it works. In this TikTok Matilda Boseley explains everything you need to know before you hit the ballot box: Some parties have done preference deals. For instance, the Queensland Liberal National party has decided to direct Senate preferences to One Nation and in return, the latter’s leader, Pauline Hanson, has said her party will direct preferences to help conservative Coalition members. The Greens have said they will suggest their voters preference Labor before the Liberals across the country. Labor is preferencing the Greens second for the Senate in every state and territory except Tasmania, where the Jacqui Lambie Network has been gifted the second spot, and the ACT, where independent David Pocock will get it. Labor is also giving second spots to some teal independents in key battleground seats Wentworth, Kooyong and Curtin. The number of campaigns from independents and minor parties this election means it will likely come down to preferences in key battleground seats. This piece from Ben Raue outlines everything you need to know about preferences before you vote. The focus this election has been on the battle to win government in the lower house. But the Senate will be crucial to what the new government will and won’t be able to do. On Saturday your Senate ballot paper is likely to have a range of micro parties, all with niche interests. Josh Butler takes you through the minor parties and what they support. It is customary for media outlets to publish an editorial backing one of the major parties before Saturday. You can read Guardian Australia’s view urging voters to say no to spin and inaction. Nine’s Melbourne and Sydney mastheads are also backing Labor. The SMH argues a Coalition devoid of imagination does not deserve another term, even though it “shares the public’s lack of enthusiasm for Albanese and his timid opposition”. The Age says integrity is the overarching theme of the campaign and Morrison has failed on that. However, the AFR, also owned by Nine, does not believe Albanese has made the case against Morrison or for himself. The Australian is also backing a re-elected Coalition government, pointing to Morrison’s handling of the economy, the pandemic and national security. The Guardian Australia live blog will bring you coverage from across the nation. Antony Green will join Leigh Sales, David Speers, Annabel Crabb, Andrew Probyn and Laura Tingle to broadcast results on the ABC’s Australia Votes from 6pm on Saturday. Over on Sky, Kieran Gilbert will anchor coverage from 5pm, along with Andrew Clennell, election analyst Tom Connell and Sky After Dark host Peta Credlin. On Seven, political editor Mark Riley will lead coverage along with Natalie Barr and Michael Usher, also from 5pm.

5/21/2022,"This week, Timor-Leste celebrates 20 years of independence. On 20 May 2002, the United Nations formally handed power to the new Timorese government and, thus, to its people. It ended a struggle often described as spanning the 24 years from the Indonesian invasion in 1975 to the UN referendum in 1999. But before Indonesia’s bloody and brutal occupation, there had been four centuries of colonial Portuguese rule. A government report estimated more than 102,000 people died during Indonesia’s reign, while Amnesty International has put the figure at as many 200,000. Most died from starvation and illness, but tens of thousands were killed or disappeared, and one researcher estimates 15% of the civilian population of Timor-Leste, then known as East Timor, was killed from 1975–80. Alex Soares is a Timorese-Australian photographer who lives in Perth. To mark the anniversary, Soares photographed and interviewed three cousins: survivors of the occupation who now live in Australia. They spoke of fleeing into the mountains, covertly aiding the pro-independence Falintil fighters (the military wing of the pro-independence Fretilin party), torture, starvation and of the 1991 Santa Cruz massacre, where Indonesian forces gunned down at least 250 pro-independence demonstrators. Soares says: “Each participant I interviewed recounted first-hand experiences of having suffered torture and starvation, of having had family and friends murdered, raped and made to disappear, and of losing everything during the war. Their stories are also full of hope, love and resilience.” These interviews have been edited for clarity. Before Indonesia invaded our country, East Timor, we had such a wonderful life. My village, Fatubessi, was famous for the best coffee. We had a simple life. But we were very happy. We knew everyone and had work. All friends and family together. Very peaceful. Every day I played with all the other kids. I didn’t have a childhood after 1975. When I was a kid and the adults first talked about war, I didn’t know what a war was. But then suddenly we understood it was bombs and death and fighting. My dad always said: “No matter what, we keep fighting until we get freedom.” So all this time we travelled with Falintil and Fretilin for four years in the mountain. We would go down to the hills, hiding in the bush, go down to Maliana, Bobonaro, the large towns that border West Timor. We’d move to the next bush, mountain. In the daytime we would sit down and rest, and at night-time we would move, crossing rivers, passing through another village. All the boys would be sent to go walk for 5-10km to see if we can find food. We’d give half to us and half to Falintil. I lost my older brother when we were travelling near the border. We sat down and had lunch with Falintil and suddenly we were ambushed by Indonesian soldiers. They started shooting at us. We kept running. And then they just opened fire. They shot my brother. My dad and my other sisters they tried to assist him. They dug a little hole about half a metre deep. But then Falintil came past them and said, “We can’t wait or else they kill you all.” So my dad and my mum had to leave my brother. No burial. I was already on the mountain. After two weeks alone, I found my family again and they told me: my brother had been killed. In 1979, we were captured by the Indonesian army. We were staying in Liquiça and were ambushed. I got shot by a soldier in my lower back. I tried to hide, but we were captured. It was October or November. Now it was my mum, dad and three siblings. Four siblings had died, two brothers and two sisters. Three of them got sick because there was no food or clean water. My dad, who was really sick, was interrogated and tortured. He passed away shortly after that. We moved in with our uncles and started a new life in Dili. It was my first time going to school. We started to get to know young people in my area in Dili. Some of us become estafeta [clandestine couriers who sent messages to the resistance]. We’d make contact with Falintil in the bush and organise resistance. From 1983 to 1993, my role as a young student was to help fight for independence. In 1993, I left Timor because the situation was getting worse. I was one of the lucky ones because our family was sponsored by family who already escaped. We bribed our way to Bali and then to Australia. After a few days of arriving in Perth, I joined with the East Timorese community in Perth to organise demonstrations. We held mass, prayed for Timor, prayed for victims, prayed for family. We grew broader community solidarity with Aussies, Christian charities. We would send funds to Falintil. At the last protest we had in 1999, there was large Aboriginal community support. At demonstrations we’d sing and scream outside the embassy. One day, very early in the morning, we woke up and went with all the young Timorese to mass at Motael church, the oldest in Dili. After the mass finished, I joined all the young people in walking along the road heading towards Santa Cruz cemetery. We made a big demonstration. We were singing, “Viva Timor Leste, Viva Sebastião Gomes!” [A Timorese student who had been killed by Indonesian forces a few weeks earlier.] I was somewhere in the middle of the group. We got to the cemetery and entered. There were lots of soldiers around but no problem at this point. They were just watching us along the road. We kept singing louder. And then suddenly they started shooting us. The protesters ran inside the cemetery. I saw people dying all around me. I was lying on the ground. Soldiers came and hit me with the butt of their guns. They hit my chest, hit my head. I was 21 years old. After they beat us in the cemetery, they threw us in an army vehicle. They took us to Comoro [a suburb of Dili]. They shocked us with electricity: me and three friends. They tortured us. Three months after the massacre, my best fried died because of his injuries. That night, my family thought I had been killed. All my face was black and bleeding and swollen. They couldn’t believe when I arrived back home. My mum was just crying and hugging me. She gave thanks to God, saying, “my oldest son is still alive”. Three years later, in 1994, some family sponsored us to come to Australia. Before we left in 1994, things got worse. Indonesia was so angry with the Santa Cruz demonstrations because it made the news all over the world. On the way to Australia, we stayed in Bali for two or three days. One aunty met us in Bali and she helped bring us to Australia. Starting in Australia was a new beginning. Everything was different. Perth was a big city for us and I really missed Timor. We left a sister and other family there. And good friends. I got to go to Australia and start a new life. I have a good job now. I now have a family, but I could have died then. I have been back to Timor four times. But I can’t feel happy because good friends are missing. I still remember lots of trauma. I was a little kid at that time but I can remember seeing the paratroopers coming down from the sky. My friends and I thought people were playing kites or something. But then my parents said, “No, these are not kites, these are paratroopers and we are being invaded.” We stayed in the hills of Dare, 20km from Dili, for three months, living with other Timorese families also fleeing the violence. And after Indonesia controlled the city they began looking for a Timorese electrician to come back to town to get the power running in the capital again. We came back to Dili and my dad went back to working as an electrician. In 1980, there was a plan for the guerrilla fighters to make an assault on the Indonesian army in Dili. It was my dad’s job to sabotage the electrical system. So the night came, my dad turned off all the power on Dili but the plan had been discovered and the Falintil attack was stopped before they got to Dili. Most of the Falintil involved were killed. The next morning, my dad was picked up by the Indonesian army. They dragged him out of our house. They took him to a torture house. They beat him, used electric shock treatment and starved him. After torturing him many more times over the next few years he stopped working. We struggled at that time for everything. The clandestine movement very secretly organised. This was the order from the guerrillas. You can only have like one person to be in charge, to know limited information. So I would just receive a message and then pass it on. I didn’t know the full picture or why. After the invasion we were forced to speak Bahasa Indonesian. We had no choice. Tetum [Timor-Leste’s lingua franca] was banned. If they caught you speaking Tetum you were in big trouble. Even going to work, they would stop you and interrogate you. “What you doing?” Everyone was a suspect. What can you do? You are young, they are army. We started to get involved in a youth movement with friends around the area. We started organising things. We made a lot of demonstrations.

5/21/2022,"Before he steps on to the set on election night, the ABC’s analyst Antony Green has endured a long excruciatingly detailed process of getting the data right. “People just think you turn up on camera and talk,” Green tells Guardian Australia ahead of the election broadcast. “Or that when I am making a prediction it is just something off the top of my head. There’s a vast amount of work to be done just to make the presentation clear.” For 30 years Green has not just been a crucial part of the ABC’s coverage at state, territory and federal elections, but he has literally written the program for the ABC’s election computer that analyses data as it comes in from the Australian Election Commission. With a degree in pure mathematics and computer science, Green was a data journalist before the term existed, joining the ABC in 1991 as a researcher and quickly becoming on-air talent alongside ABC legends including the late Andrew Olle, Paul Lyneham and Ian Carroll, and of course the now-retired Kerry O’Brien. By the time Green joins O’Brien’s successor Leigh Sales, who is hosting her third election, on the set of Australia Votes on Saturday, he would have already been writing code, setting up the database with candidates, polling places and past results, loading preference formulas and checking the television graphics and, in more recent years, the ABC’s election website. The election map has never looked so hexy. https://t.co/aCU06iuTx9 Sales will be joined by journalists David Speers, Annabel Crabb, Andrew Probyn and Laura Tingle from 6pm and will cross to reporters around the country for the latest news. “I’ve spent most of the last few days getting bloody test data,” Green says, explaining that the system needs testing even though he doesn’t have real data from AEC yet. The number of independents makes the task of calling the election “technically more difficult”, Green says, because “we don’t have historical preference counts as a comparison”. As to what time he will call the election this year, Green says it depends on how close it is. “I always say that by 7.30 you will know the result or you’ll know you have to wait,” Green says. His biggest fear is “the data not arriving” or “something going wrong with our computer”, and amazingly he has never made a wrong call on who won. Green says what makes the ABC’s broadcast stand out is “less political argy bargy” and more calm analysis. “The campaign’s over; you’re just trying to find out who won,” he says. “The cheapest way to do an election coverage is just to set up something that looks like the Footy Show and get everyone to disagree. “It’s very entertaining if you want to have people shouting at each other. But sometimes people just want to know the result. I've updated my seat by seat numbers on pre-poll voting and postal applications.

5/21/2022,"The Morrison government has promised to spend almost $8m every hour since the election campaign began, pledging more than $7.5bn for projects across the country in its bid to remain in power. Labor, for its part, has pledged about $5bn over the past six weeks, or about $5m an hour, with both major parties overwhelmingly focused on marginal seat contests that will determine the election outcome. In the past week alone, the Coalition has pledged $1.5bn to marginal electorates, compared to Labor’s $650m, with both targeting more than half of their promised funding in electorates held by the opposing side. About 77% of Labor’s local election commitments – those that target single electorates – have been made to people living in marginal seats, totalling $1.4bn, compared to about 66%, or $2.5bn, of the Coalition’s spend. Both sides are favouring marginal seats disproportionately, with these electorates making up just 32% of all seats nationally. The Coalition’s most splurged on seats in the past six weeks are Eden-Monaro, Gilmore and Bennelong, while the top three Labor seats during the campaign are Leichhardt, Swan and Lingiari. A Guardian Australia analysis of the campaign spending splurge shows the figures are even higher when commitments made since the beginning of the year are factored in, with a combined total of $43bn pledged by the major parties since 1 January, with almost $8bn of that promised to marginal electorates. People living in the crucial swing states of Tasmania and Queensland are also disproportionately benefitting from the spending pledges, with the major parties clearly funnelling dollars into some states at the expense of others. The Labor party’s election promises in Tasmania account for 18% of their total spending since the campaign kicked off on 11 April, while the island state only has 2.1% of Australia’s population. Labor is hoping to win the seats of Bass and Braddon in Tasmania from the Coalition, and has stepped up its spending in the past week in the two seats, pledging funding for a dozen individual projects at a cost of about $30m. In total, Labor has pledged $45m to electorate specific projects in Bass, and $37m to projects in Braddon since the start of the campaign, compared to the $97m the Coalition has promised in Bass and $60m in Braddon. Similarly, the Coalition’s spending in the Northern Territory accounts for 20.7% of their spending, while the Territory has only 1% of Australia’s population. The government has been throwing resources at the NT seat of Lingiari in the hope it can be flipped from the Labor party, spending more than $200m since the beginning of the year on local projects, along with territory-wide commitments that have been spearheaded by Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce. Labor has been spending defensively in the seat, also promising $178m worth of projects to Lingiari which is being vacated by long-serving Labor MP Warren Snowdon.Victoria has the biggest “underspend” compared to its population share. The state is home to 25% of the population yet the Coalition has only pledged 9.4% of its election spending there, while Labor has promised just 4.3%. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The parties are each targeting electorates held by the other in Victoria, with Labor hopeful of winning Chisholm and Higgins, and the Coalition targeting Corangamite and McEwen. But the combined spend from both major parties in the state is the lowest of all states and territories bar the ACT, attracting just $926m of the total $12bn spend, about $700m from the Coalition and $200m from Labor. Overall, Labor has promised 40% of its election spending to Queensland, where it is hoping to win up to three seats, compared to 24% of the Coalition’s spend, and its population share of 20.4%. During the campaign, the two parties have each pledged about $2bn to projects in Queensland, focused on the marginal seats of Leichhardt, Flynn and Longman, with the state topping the list of election commitments for Labor, and behind New South Wales for the Coalition. In the past week, the Coalition has boosted its spending in the marginal seats of Eden-Monaro and Bennelong in NSW, and Longman and Flynn in Queensland. For Labor, its focus in the final days of the campaign has been projects in the seat of Leichhardt in Queensland, Swan in WA, the independent held seat of Clark in Hobart, and a last-minute flurry in the western Sydney seat of Greenway. The total count of the Coalition and Labor’s election promises since the start of the campaign is more than 1,000, most of which are announced through the social media pages of MPs and candidates. The total amount promised by the Coalition for both electorate-only and statewide projects since the start of the campaign is $7.5bn, compared to $4.9bn for Labor. This equates to the Coalition spending $189m every day of the 40-day campaign, and Labor spending $122m.",News/Australia news,"$8m an hour: in the battle for marginal seats, it’s a contest of who can splurge the most",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/21/8m-an-hour-in-the-battle-for-marginal-seats-its-a-contest-of-who-can-splurge-the-most
5/21/2022,"John Paterson regularly has people from remote communities text him grocery receipts to show how prices have spiked over the past few months. Travelling across the Northern Territory in his role as CEO of Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory (Amsant), Paterson says he notices prices increase sharply the more remote the location. “It has almost become unaffordable now,” he says. In the Northern Territory, food in supermarkets is 56% more expensive in remote communities than regional supermarkets due to long supply chains and poor quality roads, according to a 2021 report by Amsant. Inflation – predicted to reach 6% by year’s end – has increased pressure. The Arnhem Land Progress Association (Alpa), supports 27 remote community stores by securing grocery items and covering the store’s freight budgets to reduce the cost of food. Normally, its annual freight budget is $250,000. But in the past 18 months, the fuel levy to deliver food to just five of its remote communities – that require delivery by sea – has risen from $37,000 to $279,000. “One group of … refrigerated pallets [of food] normally costs up to $267,” says Alastair King, CEO of Alpa. “With the current increases that now costs $341.” “We are currently absorbing that and it is completely unsustainable.” Rob Totten, store manager of a supermarket in Maningrida, Arnhem Land, says the price of some food products has “gone through the roof”. “Baked beans have gone from $29.95 to $33.80 a carton. One carton of corned beef was $151 in April and it’s now $176,” he says, adding this doesn’t factor in the additional costs from increased freight charges. “We definitely can’t absorb that or we won’t be here to supply the food. So we have to actually put the cost of food up.” One shopper showed Guardian Australia a receipt of $9.20 for two litres of milk. In the 2018–19 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey, 43% of Indigenous people living in remote communities reported that they had run out of food in the previous 12 months. “[When] you don’t have an increase in terms of your income to be able to meet these cost of living pressures, what you end up with is families having to decide what they do,” says Deborah Di Natale, CEO of the Northern Territory of Council Services. “Do they pay for medicine? Or do they pay for the cereal in the morning? Those are really unacceptable situations for families that are living in poverty.” In October last year, Foodbank South Australia opened a new service in Alice Springs and Ceduna. CEO Greg Pattinson says they have had people travelling from across the Western Australia border, representatives from schools from as far as 900km, travel to pick up food and take it back to their communities. Foodbank hopes to extend to more remote communities, but he says rising costs means it is now limited in how much it can help people. “Our ability to buy food is now restricted as well because we’ve limited funds from our fundraising and the cost of things like milk and meat and those key staple foods are increasing,” Pattinson says. “That means we aren’t going to have as much food as we had last year to be able to support people. And that’s the issue I’ve seen, we are seeing more people coming through but our ability to support them is potentially diminishing. It’s quite concerning.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Prof Jon Altman, an expert in economic development for Indigenous Australia at ANU and a director of the Karrkad-Kanjdji Trust – a charity that delivers food and medicine to three remote Indigenous communities – says the decision by the federal government to raise the rate of jobseeker during the Covid-19 pandemic has proven that increased income support can help alleviate food insecurity in remote communities. With more income, Altman says people reported they were buying more food and were less hungry. “If you really want to address these issues then the thing to do is to give people more realistic income, particularly when they live remotely,” he says. After the 2020 inquiry into food prices and food security in remote Indigenous communities, the Coalition committed $5m in the 2021-2022 budget. This was later increased to $8m, to assist remote community stores to overcome barriers to food security. “Outcomes from this grant round were announced in March 2022 and the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) is currently working with successful applicants to enter into funding agreements,” said a spokesperson from the NIAA. “The NIAA continues to work closely with communities, stores and other industry stakeholders to address food security risks across the country.” Paterson is advocating to extend the footprint of an Aboriginal controlled organisation like Alpa to increase the buying power of remote community stores. “People want fresher food, they want cheaper food, and the way to do that is bulk purchasing by community stores that are run and led by Aboriginal people,” he says. “If we want to close the gap, plus the life expectancy gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people, then food security is a major issue that needs serious attention.”",News/Australia news,‘Through the roof’ food prices in remote NT are forcing Aboriginal families to make impossible choices,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/21/through-the-roof-food-prices-in-remote-nt-are-forcing-aboriginal-families-to-make-impossible-choices
5/21/2022,"For Jamshid Mirzaee, this federal election has been a first in many ways. It is the first time he has voted, for anything; the first election campaign he’s seen and the first time he has felt recognised as a citizen of Australia. “I felt powerful, it was my first time and I have just become a citizen as well – everyone is going to be counted,” he said after pre-polling ahead of Saturday’s federal election. “I am the only Australian citizen in my family, and it felt like I had the power to make changes in this country.” Mirzaee was born in Afghanistan and came to Australia from Iran in 2016. He was granted citizenship earlier this year. He decided to pre-poll and said he was initially confused by the process. “At the beginning, I found it a bit hard, they gave me the two papers, one was the big one and the other small, with all these names on it, and I wasn’t really sure what to do with it. I ended up selecting the names that I knew; my first choice was the Greens and second was Labor.” Mirzaee lives in the marginal seat of Parramatta and said he hopes whoever wins on Saturday will improve the lives of refugees and migrants. “I hope this election will result in good changes for us, especially for refugees, for migrants, for those who are waiting to be permanent.” The Australian Electoral Commission estimates about 440,000 new citizens will cast a vote for the first time in 2022. Farzana Mazari was 14 when she arrived from Pakistan in 2017. The now 19-year-old is embracing the opportunity to help shape the country’s future. “I have already voted, and it felt good,” she said. “It felt like I have the right to have a say, no matter what. We should, and do, have the right to decide who the prime minister will be.” Mazari said she wanted to vote for the party with the most open refugee policy – which she believed was Labor. “I know how hard the process was, I know how hard it can get, and I hope it improves in the future,” she said. Simon Deng was born in Sudan, moved to Kenya when he was six and arrived in Australia in 2015. He is now a second-year student at university and excited to vote for the first time on Saturday. “I never thought I’d have a voice in Australia, it’s kind of unreal, I never saw this coming, it’s been a great experience,” Deng said. “It’s a power that we have, it feels good to know your voice actually can make a difference. This is the voice of the people, we’re obviously not going to say everything, but we do get a say.” Deng said he would be voting Labor because he liked their policies – particularly on childcare. He said he had enjoyed seeing the campaign play out across the country. “People are so cooperative here, campaigns in other countries can be much worse. Here, it doesn’t matter what side you’re on, you’re just not going to go hard out on someone, I like the respect they have for each other.” But Deng did acknowledge “it could have been more interesting, hey?”",News/Australia news,‘It’s kind of unreal’: new citizens feel the ‘power’ of voting in Australia for the first time,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/21/its-kind-of-unreal-new-citizens-feel-the-power-of-voting-in-australia-for-the-first-time
5/21/2022,"The Coalition has announced more than $1bn in climate funding that could go to fossil fuel developments since setting a target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 last year, an analysis has found. The bulk of the funding promised during the election campaign has been to develop “clean” hydrogen – a term often used to refer to hydrogen made with gas, a fossil fuel – and carbon capture and storage (CCS), which has had little success to date but oil and gas executives say will need to play a massive role if the world is to slash emissions. The progressive thinktank the Australia Institute tallied pledges to develop clean hydrogen and CCS including $300m for the Northern Territory, $158m in Queensland, and at least $140m for Western Australia. Up to $40m has been promised to help gas giant Woodside build a CCS hub in the Pilbara. The institute’s climate and energy program director, Richie Merzian, said it illustrated the extent to which the government was supporting fossil fuel industries while promising to act on the climate crisis. Merzian said hydrogen made with gas could only have low emissions if CCS proved economically viable, and that had not yet happened at scale despite billions of dollars in commitments from Australian governments. He said clean hydrogen was “a marketing term, not a climate solution”, and that other countries were putting significant support into zero-emissions green hydrogen made with renewable energy. “If hydrogen is supposed to be a climate solution and act as an alternative to fossil fuels, it can’t be based on fossil fuels in any way,” he said. Oil and gas executives expressed optimism at a conference in Brisbane this week about CCS and clean hydrogen allowing the industry to expand while trying to reduce emissions. The conference heard Australia was home to the biggest CCS project in the world – Chevron’s Gorgon development in the Pilbara, which the company says has captured and injected underground about 6m tonnes of emissions since belatedly starting operation nearly three years ago. To put that into context, Australia alone emits about 500m tonnes a year. The Coalition did not respond to questions, including on why it believed investing clean hydrogen made with gas and CCS projects would lead to significant emissions reductions. It has previously said it was “strongly committed to a gas-fired recovery”, including opening up the potentially vast Beetaloo gas basin in the NT, and has argued that support for hydrogen and CCS can reduce emissions while creating jobs. It has dismissed a warning from the International Energy Agency that no new oil and gas fields should be opened if the world is to keep the possibility of limiting global heating to 1.5C alive. The Australia Institute estimated the government had committed up to $1.7bn in climate funding that could go to fossil fuel projects since Scott Morrison set a net zero target in October. The pledges included: $50m in the budget for a “future gas infrastructure investment framework”. $20m for CarbonNet, a project that aims to capture and store carbon dioxide in an offshore reservoir in Gippsland in Victoria. $66m in the budget for a “patent box” tax concession for “low emissions technology innovations”. $200m for clean hydrogen and “low emissions technology partnerships” with Japan and South Korea. The institute also included the November announcement of a $500m “low emissions technology commercialisation fund” to back government priority areas, which include hydrogen, CCS, energy storage and “ultra low-cost solar”. The future of the proposed fund is uncertain: the government promised legislation in the last term of parliament to set up the fund as part of the national green bank, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), but no bill was introduced. Labor backed all energy commitments in the budget, and has matched government green hydrogen commitments during the campaign, including up to $44.9m for a development in Queensland, but has expressed scepticism about the strength of government support for CCS. With the crossbench, Labor opposed government attempts to re-cast two clean energy agencies, the CEFC and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, so they could fund CCS and gas projects. A Labor spokesperson said it would support “any emissions reduction technology that stacks up scientifically and commercially”. “What Labor doesn’t support is the diversion of scarce renewable energy funding to non-renewables, which the government has consistently tried to do,” they said. A separate analysis examined what it would mean for Australia’s national emissions if all new coal and gas projects on a government department list of proposed developments went ahead. The chief executive and senior scientist at Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, found they would add 8.3% to Australia’s annual emissions by 2030. It would mean the country would probably easily miss the Coalition’s 2030 target of a 26% to 28% cut in emissions compared with 2005 levels unless new policies were introduced. Labor has a target of a 43% cut over the timeframe. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning If all emissions from the coal and gas developments were counted, including those from burning the fossil fuels after they were sold overseas, Hare said it would add the equivalent of 170% of Australia’s current emissions to the global total. He said while not all of the more than 100 coal and gas proposals were likely to go ahead, their potential emissions would be a significant issue for the next government. “The outlook for Australia if these projects are not rolled back is really quite disastrous,” Hare said. “It would add to our pariah status internationally.” The Coalition and Labor say new coal and gas developments should be allowed to go ahead while businesses want to invest and if they meet local environmental standards. The Greens want a moratorium on all new coal and gas developments and thermal coal to be phased out by 2030.",News/Environment,"More than $1bn of Coalition’s climate funding could go to fossil fuel projects, analysis finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/21/more-than-1bn-of-coalitions-climate-funding-could-go-to-fossil-fuel-projects-analysis-finds
5/21/2022,"As we’re coming to the end of the election campaign, I’ve been both happily surprised and majorly disappointed. Both Anthony Albanese and Scott Morrison have mostly failed to discuss poverty in the public forum, although a few Labor MPs have broken party lines to say they support an immediate increase to jobseeker. The Greens and a lot of smaller parties and independents have an increase in welfare payments as their policy. I believe the lack of having these conversations just shows how out of touch Australian politicians actually are. Both sides are talking about the cost of living but leave out the impacts this is having on people living below the poverty line who are impacted the most. Living on $330 a week is unsustainable and I can’t help but wonder how long it’s been since a politician had to choose between a loaf of bread or two litres of milk. If they have to walk around a supermarket with a calculator stopping to type in each product, afraid to go over a limit, and have to put things back at the checkout? Have they ever had to sleep in a tent instead of a house and not by choice? This is what Australians are facing and letting people access their super early isn’t going to fix it. Whoever wins the next election has a big job ahead of them. I hope they also understand that governing the country is a privilege and not a right. They need to govern for all, not just the wealthy. After all, the poor vote too. Ignoring us won’t make the problem of poverty go away. It will just make us louder. Poverty is and always has been a policy choice. Now we need a government to make the right choice.  Melissa Fisher is an Adelaide artist and anti-poverty activist who relies on jobseeker Election promises during an ever-evolving campaign have been diverse and plentiful but whether meaningful change is on the way for north Queensland remains to be seen. While the seat of Herbert is being hotly contested and inspiring some good old-fashioned pork-barreling, and the Coalition certainly capitalised on discretionary grants in their pre-election budget, it’s difficult to determine which policies and commitments will amount to long-term sustainable growth for our region. Both major parties have committed $70m to the NQH2 Hydrogen Consortium and promised support to the Townsville City Deal. The Coalition supports Hells Gate dam and development of an industrial precinct in Ayr, while the opposition is promising manufacturing opportunities and backing the NQ SPARK defence simulation facility. A variety of policies to address the regional housing crisis have been announced and debated, from building tens of thousands of homes and lowering deposits for home buyers through to capping mortgage rates and the concept of government co-ownership. I fear that stimulating demand without properly addressing supply may inadvertently result in price hikes and the cynic in me questions the “benefits” of quick-fix solutions to such a complex issue. It’s sad to note that both parties seem to be neglecting the western region of north Queensland. Many game-changing, capacity-building projects are simply being overlooked, thereby stifling growth in agriculture, innovation, health, research and skills development, and ignoring our inherent potential. I try not to roll my eyes each time I hear that regional Australia is the “lifeblood of our nation” when the attention we receive is often tokenistic at best. I doubt that either party sincerely acknowledges the development of northern Australia as a priority, lamenting that it will probably remain nothing more than a pipe dream unless our regional electorates miraculously become marginal seats. Wouldn’t that make a difference?!  Rachael Coco is a management committee member of the North Queensland State Alliance and a contract administrator With little focus on healthcare from either leader, for me this campaign has come down to a competition of character. Covid was only muttered in the same breath as economic recovery, as our PM claimed credit for saving the country despite surging cases and record deaths. The health system is still under enormous strain and staff are fatigued from doing the actual saving, but Scott Morrison was too loudly singing his own praises to notice. He created distractions and behaved like Covid was a distant memory, basking in its afterglow while arguing workers getting slammed to drive his miraculous economic recovery didn’t deserve a pay rise. There’s been no acknowledgement that all it took was a virus to expose the frightful inadequacies in our chronically underfunded healthcare system. No vision to create the brighter country that anxious Aussies dreamed we could become during the dark days of lockdowns. Only the Greens have made any attempt to better the healthcare system by announcing dental and mental into Medicare. I found the PM mocking Anthony Albanese for his slow Covid recovery distasteful when I know paramedics who have long Covid – my workmates couldn’t wait it out in the Lodge and they certainly couldn’t brag about their workload while lying face down in a coma. While I did find Albanese’s campaign style too cautious and uninspiring, I don’t blame him when he’s up against a bulldozer and one gaffe away from losing a week of policy announcements to tabloid click-bait frenzies. The fact that 70% of aged care workers still haven’t received their pandemic cash bonus confirms to me that Morrison is all sales pitch and no substance.

It is currently held by Labor with a margin of 1%. You can read our profile of Corangamite here. Nicholls Nicholls is a rural seat spanning 14,773 sq km west from Yarrawonga along the Murray River to Echuca, including the regional city of Shepparton. The sitting member, Damian Drum, is retiring, prompting a three-way contest in the traditionally conservative seat between the Nationals, the Liberals and popular Shepparton councillor Rob Priestly, running as an independent. It is currently held by the Nationals with a margin of 20%. You can read our profile of Nicholls here. Higgins Higgins, in Melbourne’s inner south-east, extends from Prahran to Malvern East, and takes in parts of Ashburton, Murrumbeena and Ormond. Higgins has been a Liberal seat since 1975 but a redistribution ahead of the election that added Windsor and removed part of Glen Iris and all of Hughesdale has favoured Labor. It is currently held by the Liberals with a margin of 3.7%. You can read our profile of Higgins here. Brisbane Brisbane covers the CBD and inner-city suburbs on the northern side of the Brisbane River. Prior to a redistribution in 2010, it was safe Labor territory but has been held by the Coalition for the past 12 years. The Liberals are facing a strong contest from both Labor and the Greens.

It is currently held by the Liberals with a margin of 6.1%. Flynn Flynn is a rural seat with two-thirds of its voters living outside the main population centre of Gladstone, taking in farmland, coal seam gas drilling and unionised towns. The seat, created in 2007, was one of the most marginal in the country before the 2019 election.

5/21/2022,"Catastrophic floods earlier this year wiped out one of the largest and most important seagrass meadows in eastern Australia, increasing the risk that dugongs and sea turtles will become stranded, according to researchers. Scientists from James Cook University monitored the health of seagrass meadows across 2,300 square kilometres of Hervey Bay and the Great Sandy Strait in southern Queensland. Prof Michael Rasheed, who led the monitoring, said there has been a drastic loss compared with previous extensive mapping of seagrass cover. “Our boat surveys show there’s almost no seagrass visible in the 2m to 17m depth range for much of the deeper meadows, and these sites have previously recorded extensive areas of seagrass,” he said. “There were some areas of sub-tidal seagrass but these were confined to the deepest areas in the northern part of the bay. “We also used helicopters to assess more than 1,300 intertidal sites throughout the Great Sandy Straits and while some sites had seagrass the cover was typically less than one percent of the seafloor, offering scant resources for dugong and turtle.” The decline in seagrass is due to sediment from floodwaters flowing into the ocean and reducing exposure to sunlight and smothering the seagrass. Dugongs and sea turtles rely on seagrass meadows for food. Dr Chris Cleguer, a dugong expert, said there was concern that dugongs in the area may stop breeding. “Some will move and some will die,” he said. In 1991, the region lost more than 1,000 square kilometres of seagrass after subsequent and severe floods. It led to the highest rate of dugong deaths on record and a 20% decline in dugong calf numbers. Cleguer said there had been an increase in turtle and dugongs becoming stranded in Queensland’s Great Sandy Marine Park over the past year. It suggested there may have been an unknown problem affecting the dugongs and sea turtles prior to the flooding. Since July 2021, Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service have recorded more than 240 stranded marine turtles and 22 stranded dugongs in the park. Parks senior ranger Dan Clifton said the numbers were significantly greater than the long-term average for the region. “We have also recently seen large, mature green turtles presenting with an ulcerative skin disease affecting the carapace and flippers. This is currently being investigated by leading authorities to determine causes so we can respond accordingly,” Clifton said. “The issues currently faced by marine wildlife in the Great Sandy Marine Park demonstrate the importance of ongoing research and surveys so that we can identify and respond to threats and how critical it is that we protect our precious ecosystems.” Rasheed said it was difficult to know for certain whether seagrass decline was occurring prior to the flood events given there was no regular large-scale monitoring of seagrass meadows. “It is highly likely though that what we’re seeing now is a result, at least in part or large part, due to the floods,” he said. Rasheed said there was good news: seagrass meadows were about to enter their growing season. The scientists hope to monitor the meadows again in September and October to determine how much has recovered. They say reports on the survey are expected to be released in June for Hervey Bay and September for the Great Sandy Straits.",News/Environment,"Dugongs and sea turtles at risk after Queensland floods wipe out seagrass, study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/21/dugongs-and-sea-turtles-at-risk-after-queensland-floods-wipe-out-seagrass-study-shows
5/21/2022,"Most fans don’t ask for much when they go to an Australian sports stadium. A fair ticket price, a reasonable seat, accurate scoreboard, quality alcoholic beverage and a meat pie somewhere between corpse cold and Hades hot. The stadium itself – the architecture, access points, the jiggery-pokery on the big screens before and after – is pretty immaterial. We’re there for the show on that gleaming green field. Everything else is window-dressing. A great stadium should be a family-friendly battleground showcasing grassroots tribalism, athletic excellence and the unifying human experience of watching games played to their limits. And most weekends, they are. That’s what makes it so unedifying to see greedy, grandstanding administrators and governments use our major stadiums as bargaining chips and indexes for content, sponsor satisfaction, consumer outlay and broadcasting deals. There is a golden decade of major events coming to Australia: the 2023 Fifa Women’s Football World Cup, 2032 Olympics and Paralympics, 2027 men’s and 2030 women’s Rugby World Cups, not to mention all the finals, grand finals and other tournaments in between. It means millions of dollars in ticket sales, tourism dollars, hotel tariffs and entertainment up for grabs for the stadiums of the cities who host. So begins the jibber-jabbering of premiers, ministers, administrators and stadium landlords. And unfortunately, like most private schoolboy fracas, it boils down to who’s got the biggest. Melbourne has the largest stadium, the MCG, with seats for 100,024 – a whopping capacity that adds millions to any code’s coffers. Although it has a long record of hosting Olympics, AFL grand finals and other extravaganzas, its only disadvantage when it comes to hosting a rugby or football World Cup final is that it is an oval peg for a rectangular game. But fans don’t care when they can walk into the old ground past the scar tree on Yarra Hill, filleted by the Wurundjeri for canoes and shields and still standing after 800 years. And sightlines don’t matter when the sonic boom of an MCG crowd reverberates in big moments. When Cathy Freeman blazed her way into history at Sydney’s Olympic Stadium it was oval and it held 109,874 for a Bledisloe Cup Test the same year. It can still hold 83,500 but Rugby Australia announced in May that it is taking Wallabies-All Blacks Tests to Victoria for the first time since 2010: at Marvel Stadium (capacity 52,500) in 2022, and the MCG in 2023. Curiously, this year’s rugby showpiece, the Australia v England Test in July, is at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where the two nations have not met since 1975. In a game built on tradition, that’s a smart play and a win for fans who troop or tram up the hill from Central, past (or via) the pubs, where the massive mural of Adam Goodes looks down, entering the ancient gates by skirting the pond where Dougie Walters once plonked a six from centre wicket. Perth’s Optus Stadium is a new, multipurpose arena capable of switching from oval to rectangle while maintaining great sightlines for spectators and upping capacity to 65,000. It has hosted the 2021 AFL grand final, a Bledisloe victory in 2019 and NRL State of Origin II is there on 26 June. Perth’s three-hour time difference puts it in the box seat for richer primetime TV slots with any northern hemisphere broadcasters on international games too. But on the ground the fans like to see their colours shimmer in the Swan River as you cross Matagarup Bridge on the way in. It’s the same on the way to Adelaide Oval where people pour out of the city to cross the curve of the footbridge, colours rippling in the Torrens. If it’s Suncorp you walk (or run) the boozy Brisbane gauntlet of Caxton Street to the “Cauldron”. This is the metric of the fans. For them the path to a great stadium begins first on the path itself. We march in, led by the glow of the lights or following the low din of the crowd. Tribal colours come from south, north, east, west, building from streams into rivers. It’s the most important metric of any major event and this is how it begins: switching off the box, getting off your bum and stumping up for the privilege of being there. This coming together creates something those bickering premiers and code chieftains can’t hear, feel or measure in a boardroom or glassed-off corporate box: drama and atmosphere. A stadium is nothing without it, just as it is nothing without the game and the players in it. Yet, instead of seeing sport as a circus of freaks, marvels and heroes, they see only the ring. They build stadiums on public land with public funds for a public who love their games but then sell ‘our’ home ground naming rights to betting agencies, telcos, banks and breweries. Fans will cop that if those funds go into making the pies hotter, the beers drinkable, the queues shorter, the parking easier, the security sharper, and the public transport safer, smarter and faster. But there’s too much jostling at the trough to care about those metrics. Everyone knows you could mow and rope a paddock in Humpty Doo and people would still endure the sponsor bombardment and sideline cash grabs to witness Collingwood v Carlton, Rabbitohs v Roosters, Wallabies v All Blacks, Victory v Sydney FC, Australia against the World. Such spectacles sell themselves, regardless of the stadium. Fans just want to get close to that green field at its heart, and the heroes close to ours.",Sport/Sport,Drama and atmosphere should be the only metrics in Australia’s stadium wars | Angus Fontaine,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/21/drama-and-atmosphere-should-be-the-only-metrics-in-australias-stadium-wars
5/21/2022,"Australians look set to dump Scott Morrison’s government and elect Labor’s Anthony Albanese as their new prime minister, according to multiple election eve opinion polls, however the rise of independent and minor party candidates means there may not be a clear result by the end of Saturday. Following six weeks on the hustings, both leaders will begin election day with a last-minute campaign stop in Melbourne. On Friday, the two leaders made their final pitch to voters, with Albanese pledging to be a leader with “integrity” and Morrison warning of the risk of change. More than six million people have already cast a vote in the election, with 4.6 million voting at pre-poll centres in the past two weeks, and more than two million applying for a postal vote. Despite a narrowing of Labor’s lead in opinion polls in the final week of the campaign, polling released on Friday suggested a surge in last-minute support for the Coalition would not be enough to see it retain government. Polls from Roy Morgan and The Australian’s Newspoll released late on Friday showed a two-party-preferred vote of 53-47 in favour of the opposition – enough of a swing toward Labor for it to claim victory. The Roy Morgan poll predicted Albanese would emerge from Saturday’s election with a majority, however the high level of support for minor parties and independents led the polling company to warn there was a strong chance its forecast majority win for Labor would not be definitively confirmed on the night, as preferences were distributed and postal votes counted. The two polls follow Guardian’s Essential polling on Wednesday pointing to a similarly slim but sufficient Labor lead. After a last-minute scramble by the Australian Electoral Commission to address an anomaly that would have seen a cohort of Covid-positive Australians miss out on voting, an extra 100,000 people are also expected to be able able to take part in telephone voting on Saturday. On Friday morning, the AEC said it had identified capacity in its phone voting system, but warned voters may face delays due to the increased demand. Labor is hopeful Albanese has run a strong enough campaign to deliver the seven seats it needs to form majority government, while the Coalition is hoping to upset that plan by winning seats off the Labor party and limiting its losses. Labor holds a notional 69 seats in the 151-seat House of Representatives, compared to the 75 held by the Liberal and National parties. A total of 76 seats are needed to form majority government. Aside from the marginal seat contest between Labor and the Coalition, the Liberal party will also be watching closely what happens in the so-called teal seats of Melbourne, Sydney and Perth, where independent candidates are threatening to knock off the incumbents. This includes the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in Kooyong, who is under threat from the independent candidate Monique Ryan, who on Friday was gathering support for an urgent federal court case against the special minister of state, Ben Morton, to fix the AEC voting issue. In the event of a close contest, it is unlikely a result will be known on Saturday night, with counting of postal ballots not to begin until Sunday. On Friday, Albanese campaigned in the marginal seat of Boothby with the former prime minister Julia Gillard, who urged a vote for Labor in the must-win marginal seat in Adelaide’s southern suburbs. Albanese spoke emotionally about his journey from being the son of a single mother in Camperdown to now running to become prime minister. “She’d be proud as punch, because she made the courageous decision in 1963 to keep a child that she had out of wedlock,” Albanese said. “The fact that young kid is now running for prime minister says a lot about her and her courage, but also says a lot about this country,” he said. Albanese said Morrison was offering “three more years of the same”, and believed people were walking away from the Liberal party after three years of division, while he wanted to “bring the country together”.

Campaigning in four marginal seats in Perth, Morrison was asked whether he was prepared for voters to give him a “kick in the shins” for everything they had endured over the past three years. “Well, the decision that Australians are making is not about rewarding anyone or necessarily punishing anyone,” he said. “What it’s about is what is going to be best for them going forward and what is best going to enable their aspirations, and what is best going to enable their aspirations is having a strong economy and a government that knows how to manage money.”",News/Australia news,Morrison and Albanese make final pitch to voters as last-minute polls tip Labor for election victory,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/21/morrison-and-albanese-make-final-pitch-to-voters-as-last-minute-polls-tip-labor-for-election-victory
5/21/2022,"Dozens of states across the US are bracing for historically high spring temperatures this weekend, as a scorching heatwave moves east. The early onslaught of sweltering weather, before what’s expected to be another hot, dry summer, is forecast to break or tie roughly 130 heat records for this time of year, with temperatures between 20F and 30F above average in the mid-Atlantic and north-east. More than 120 million Americans are expected to be affected by the punishing heat, raising fears of health risks for the most vulnerable, outdoor workers and those who do not have access to indoor cooling. The National Weather Service issued a special statement cautioning residents to remain vigilant for signs of heat illness, take breaks inside when possible, and stay hydrated. “Coming out of winter and the cooler temperatures, it could be a shock to the system, especially if you are spending extended periods outside,” said Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center, noting that the unseasonable escalation in temperatures might catch some areas off-guard, when there might otherwise be more infrastructure available providing shelter and other resources. “It is a little early so everything might not quite be where it would be if we were in the middle of summer,” he said. “It is really these first couple events when everyone is getting used to it and just understanding what they need to do.” Records are expected to be broken in large swaths of the east, including in Washington DC, forecast to hit 96F on Saturday, and in Boston, which could get up to 93F. Already, Texas has been pummeled by the heat, which delivered Dallas’s hottest May in history, and the south-west has cooked as strong winds fanned wildfire risks throughout the drought-stricken region. Heat is a silent killer, often responsible for more deaths than higher-profile disasters like floods, hurricanes or tornadoes, and the rising toll is expected to worsen as the world warms. The climate crisis has set the stage for increasing and intensifying heatwaves in the coming decades, and models indicate that there could be between 25 and 30 extreme events a year by mid-century – up from an average of between four and six a year historically. They are also expected to cover wider swaths of land regionally than before. Although temperatures are expected to drop again after the weekend, another sizzling summer is in store. “There does seem to be a signal that it will be a warmer than average summer for the mid-Atlantic or north-east,” Chenard said, adding that how higher temperatures would translate into specific heatwaves was less clear. As the east coast cooks this weekend, the west will get a short reprieve. Although risks remain high for wildfires across the south-west, especially in New Mexico, where the country’s biggest blaze – and the largest in state history – continues to burn, the region will get a blast of unseasonably cold weather. Parts of Colorado, which had temperatures hovering near the 90s, are now expecting to be pummeled with snow. Accompanied by gusty winds, the system will deliver “a dramatic drop of temperatures”, according to the National Weather Service, which has forecast a shift from oppressive heat to freezing temperatures across the central high plains. The systems causing the weather whiplash on each side of the country are separate but connected. “When one part of the country is well above normal, somewhere else is getting that other end of the wave,” Chenard said. “In that sense there is a connection, but it is not the same specific weather system.” The blast of cold won’t be enough to extinguish wildfire threats farther west, the NWS reported, as “a critical fire risk remains in effect for much of New Mexico, Colorado, southern Utah and northern Arizona today as windy/dry conditions fuel the fire threat”.",News/US news,Historic heatwave poised to hit dozens of US states this weekend,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/20/us-heatwave-weekend-temperatures-climate-crisis
5/21/2022,"To this day Joleon Lescott still hates watching the final day of the 2011-12 Premier League season. Arguably it was his error, a poor defensive header allowing Djibril Cissé to equalise for Queens Park Rangers, that set up the most thrilling climax seen in English top‑flight football. And so for Lescott the memory of Manchester City’s greatest day evokes a plethora of varying emotions, not all of them pleasurable. “I just don’t enjoy it,” he confides in 93:20, the documentary commemorating City’s triumph. “I want it to be cleaner. I want a 3-0.” The sensation of glory is pain multiplied by time divided by shock. For City fans the ecstasy of 2012 – the pain of 44 gruelling years, flipped in a single second – will never truly be matched. And yet, even knowing what we do now, how many City fans would still side with Lescott, strip out the trembling fear and the bitter tears of frustration, take their clean and unfussy 3-0 win? How many would do so again this Sunday against Aston Villa? As we approach the final bars of the 2021-22 season, a wild ride with one more wicked twist in it, City may just be about to reacquaint themselves with the taste of suffering. “All that is logical says City cannot blow it from here,” Peter Drury says on the television commentary before that QPR game a decade ago, and we might be tempted to draw a similar conclusion here. For all the organisation and discipline of Steven Gerrard’s Villa side it is almost impossible to see them coping with the voracity of City’s press, their penetration and intensity, the sheer variety of the angles at which they strike. City’s squad have benefited from two days off and their staff from a full week of preparation. Villa will take the field less than 72 hours after being embroiled in a bruising 1-1 draw with Burnley. Whether after three minutes or 93 minutes, all that is logical says City cannot blow it from here. But – and there is always a but – you just never quite know. The mentality of these occasions can be a weird and disorienting thing, perhaps more akin to a big cup final than a league game. For City’s international players, which is most of them, this will have been their first full week without a game since early-February: a break from routine, a different kind of energy, time to rest but also plenty of time to think. For serial title-winner Pep Guardiola the final-day showdown remains a largely unfamiliar experience. Seven of his nine league titles as a manager were sealed in advance of the final day, with winning margins of between four and 19 points. This is the Guardiola method: the rolling 38-week tank squadron that beats opponents with perfect processes, not perfect moments. His teams succeed because they play without fear of failure. It is why Guardiola is especially appreciative of his players when they lose: he wants them to feel like the result is the least important thing of all. Which works brilliantly right up until the point when the result is all that’s left. Even his two last-day triumphs had a bloodlessness to them. In 2010 his Barcelona side played Real Valladolid needing a win to seal the title, went 2-0 up within half an hour and sauntered to a 4-0 procession. Three years ago, in a similar position, City went 1-0 down early on to Brighton, equalised within 83 seconds and won 4-1. The lesson: if City are going to get this done, better to get it done early. Otherwise we are into Lescott territory: a petrified crowd, players operating on the very edge of their sanity. Every Villa counterattack will feel like a cattle prod in the ribs. Villa, of course, will have their own motivations. They are tied with City on seven league titles; a City win would move them into fifth place on their own. Gerrard, for his own part, would love nothing more than to play a part in winning the title for his old club Liverpool. Villa fans would love nothing more than to see Jack Grealish, the player who left them to win trophies, end the season empty-handed. Which is why, for all the talk of teams with “nothing to play for”, the broader picture is often far more complex. Could Wolves spring a shock on Liverpool? Bruno Lage’s side have been pretty watery in recent weeks but their 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge proved that there is precious little deference in them. A summer of churn and renewal awaits and Lage has warned a flabby, uneven squad that they are playing for their futures. Besides, when you are involved in a game this important, a basic species pride tends to kick in. The same will apply to mid-table Brentford and Newcastle as they prepare to play a supporting role in an enthralling relegation shootout. Leeds, who need to better Burnley’s result against Newcastle, showed against Brighton on Sunday the fight is still there. Recent form, however, suggests the quality is not. And so to Lancashire, where a Burnley win would keep them up for a seventh consecutive season. Again, their commitment has never been in question; the problem, as ever, is the scarcity of chances they create. That is not realistically going to change in the space of 90 minutes. All Burnley can do is the basics: keep their heads, treasure the ball and hope for the best. Elsewhere the plot-lines are simpler. Arsenal are two points off fourth place with a vastly inferior goal difference and their only real chance of securing Champions League football relies on Tottenham doing a Tottenham at Carrow Road. Meanwhile Son Heung-min is one goal behind Mohamed Salah as he strives to become the first Golden Boot winner in modern times to be neither a recognised striker nor play for a title-chasing club. Then again, we should probably not rule out a late five-goal burst from Cristiano Ronaldo against Crystal Palace, once again sticking it to all the haters, the critics and the cucks in the all-important race for sixth. In fact, virtually every game has something riding on it: from the title to the Champions League to the Europa League to basic survival. Watford will be desperate to avoid the wooden spoon when they play Chelsea. Southampton will simply be relieved not to lose 9-0 again. It has been a torrid nine months, stalked by plague and fear, postponements and pitch invasions, sackings and shellackings, takeovers and sanctions, heartwarming comebacks and spine-tingling memories. And with 90 minutes remaining, nothing has been settled, nothing has been resolved and nothing is guaranteed. The only certainty is that one way or the other it’s going to hurt.",Sport/Football,Glory awaits but first comes the pain for Guardiola and Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/20/glory-awaits-but-first-comes-the-pain-for-pep-guardiola-and-manchester-city
5/21/2022,"During the height of the Delta outbreak last year, Wellington awoke to some exciting news – a pair of titipounamu, New Zealand’s smallest bird, which had been missing from the city for more than 100 years, had built a tiny nest in a patch of urban forest just a few kilometres from parliament. It was a huge point of pride for Wellingtonians and has been credited to the creation of urban eco-sanctuary Zealandia. Opened in 1999, the sanctuary can lay claim to having boosted urban bird populations and fostered a sense of city-wide unity over conservation. “In the 1990s seeing a tūī in suburban Wellington was a big deal, let alone a kākā,” says Adam Ellis, a keen birdwatcher in Wellington. “Zealandia … created such a change in bird life that birds like tūī became a common garden bird.” For Mike Taylor, another bird lover, seeing the native falcon, the kārearea, sitting in his pine trees overlooking the valley “symbolises the massive increase in avian activity in the last two decades”. But the charismatic parrot the kākā is “the biggest success story of Wellington”, he says, hastening to add: “Being woken up by their raucous call of 5am gangs patrolling the Kaiwharawhara stream corridor is perhaps no longer seen as a success by some!” New research published in the Journal of Animal Ecology found that restoring native forest in cities does indeed bring back native birds – even those absent for generations – and the older the forest, the more species it can support. Its lead author, Elizabeth Elliot Noe, a doctoral student at Lincoln University but based in Waikato, studied 25 restored urban forests across Hamilton and New Plymouth, representing 72 years of forest development. She found that younger forests supported small insect-eating and omnivorous birds like the curious pīwakawaka, while older forests attracted back nectar- and fruit-feeding species like the melodious tūī. As well as restoring balance to urban ecosystems, the return of birdlife creates an emotional bond between humans and other species, Elliot Noe suggests. “We’re becoming disconnected from our natural environments and the native species that make up those environments … There’s a lot of research that shows that … having daily experience of [nature] is good for our mental health, wellbeing and physical health,” she said. Wellington is the poster-city for that growing connection between people, birds and conservation. A city-wide predator-free campaign has residents setting pest-traps in their backyards and planting native trees, and local conservation groups hold regular working bees, while Zealandia boasts 500 volunteers and a long waitlist to join. Walking through Zealandia, it isn’t difficult to see why. Most visitors compare it to Jurassic Park, says Gini Letham, its lead ranger. The 225 hectares of regenerating bush just 10 minutes from the city centre surrounds a lake, winding creeks and a wetland, and is home to a cacophony of birdsong from 40 different species. Nearly 9km of predator-proofing fence surrounds the block. The eco-sanctuary hosts more than just birdlife: tuatara lizards, tuna (native eels), freshwater mussels, frogs and wētā, a type of giant cricket, also dwell there. Zealandia plans eventually to restore the land to pre-colonial times. “Jim Lynch, who founded it, described Wellington as a biodiversity basketcase,” Letham recalls. “There were hardly any native birds, and just nine breeding pair of tui across Wellington.” Once the sanctuary was established, the tūī returned on their own – as did the portly kereru and the elegant shag. A Wellington council report in April 2021 found that Zealandia was “having a measurable ‘halo’ effect on native forest bird communities throughout Wellington City”. The number of native birds counted across the capital since 2011 had risen by 50%, it said, and for some species those figures were much higher: kākā had increased by 250%, kererū by 186% and tūī by 121%. Because of this, bird communities in parks and reserves across the city were becoming more diverse and increasingly dominated by native species, it said. “When you see birds in your backyard that no one else has, it makes you want to do something for them,” Letham says. “One of our main missions is to connect people with nature – it’s not necessarily coming here for a bush walk, but it’s also about looking after nature in their own backyard and spreading it past just the sanctuary.” For urban bird spotter Adam Ellis, that means maintaining rat and mustelid traps, planting native trees and not having a cat. And the rewards are numerous, he says. Among them: “Seeing 20 tūī at a time flying high above the valley, dogfighting and screeching over the ownership of the karo nectar when it’s in flower; the ‘ki-ki-ki-ki’ of a high flying kārearea [falcon] that used to be so rare, no longer a big deal; and a shabby formation of five kākā given away by their raucous chatter and pseudo-melodious whistles.”",News/World news,Urban forests create birdlife boom in New Zealand’s cities,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/urban-forests-create-birdlife-boom-in-new-zealands-cities
5/21/2022,"A woman who said she was terrorised by an MI5 agent with a background in rightwing extremism is taking legal action against the security service. Beth, not her real name, claimed the man, her former partner, attacked her with a machete and threatened to kill her. The agent – known only as X for legal reasons – is a foreign national who worked as a paid informant for MI5 infiltrating extremist networks in the UK. He used his security status to coercively control the woman, telling her that she would be killed if she reported his abusive behaviour, according to an investigation by the BBC. Beth has now launched a legal complaint with the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, the watchdog for the intelligence agencies, the Centre for Women’s Justice (CWJ) reported. The CWJ said it was acting for Beth “in a formal complaint, and linked human rights claim” and “also exploring action against a police force who have failed to take action against the perpetrator despite repeated reports”. The BBC was only able to tell the British woman’s story on Thursday after winning a high court battle with the government. But it was blocked from disclosing information likely to identify the man, who is said to be a covert human intelligence source (Chis). The government said disclosing his identity would threaten national security and endanger his life. The man is said to have praised white supremacist mass murderers and even said that he wanted to commit a similar act of violence. Beth said he sexually assaulted her, and was also abusive and coercive. He once attacked her with a machete and said he would kill her, as shown on a video captured on her mobile phone. Police did investigate the attack but the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped the case as it came to court. Beth said the police did not take a full statement from her or obtain the mobile video of the incident. The police force, which has not been named, and the CPS said the case was discontinued for lack of evidence. The CWJ said Beth will argue that MI5’s conduct may have breached her human rights, “in that by recruiting and affording protection to X, they were effectively enabling X to subject her to serious violence and abuse with impunity”. It added: “Beth is asking the Investigatory Powers Tribunal to investigate MI5’s recruitment and handling of X, and whether any steps were taken to address the clear risk of harm that he posed.” In a statement released by the organisation, Beth said: “Above all, I hope that this will cause the police to reopen the case against X and actually do something about his crimes, none of which have been properly investigated. I have fought tooth and nail over the last few years to get the police to take me seriously, but all for nothing. No one should have to experience the lack of empathy that the police have shown me.” Her solicitor Kate Ellis said her case “raises a number of issues regarding the state’s protection – whether intentionally or through neglect – of those who hold extreme misogynistic views and pose a risk of serious violence towards women and girls”. The shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said there needed to be an “independent assessment” of how the “troubling” case was handled. “Domestic abuse is an appalling and dangerous crime and victims need to know that it will always be taken immensely seriously by all agencies, especially those responsible for keeping us safe,” she said. The government previously said it would not comment on security or intelligence.",News/UK news,Woman ‘abused’ by MI5 agent takes legal action against service,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/20/woman-terrorised-by-mi5-agent-takes-legal-action-against-service
5/21/2022,"Universities could face “immense difficulties” in adjusting their teaching and learning support for students with hidden or emerging disabilities, after a landmark ruling awarded £50,000 in damages to the estate of a student after her suicide. A judge ruled that the University of Bristol failed to make adjustments to how it assessed Natasha Abrahart’s academic work, leading to her suicide in 2018 while in the second year of an undergraduate physics degree. The judge found that while Natasha had no declared disabilities when she started her studies, emerging social anxiety caused her to repeatedly avoid attending oral assessments that were required to pass her course. While the university considered making adjustments that may have enabled Natasha to complete the assessments, nothing was done by the time of her death. Julian Sladdin, a partner at Pinsent Masons law firm, said the outcome of the case was unusual in several respects, including the issue of a university’s support for a student with disabilities, and the way that support – or lack of it – may have resulted in tragedy. “In terms of general principles, I think the issue with this case is that universities will always be in situations where they have students who may not be statemented, or may not have a clear diagnosis of disability when they arrive at university, and it may be that subsequently they are diagnosed. “In those situations, obviously, the Equality Act then applies to those students, and there’s a need to make adjustments for those students and provide them with support. “And I think what this case highlights is the immense difficulty around that in terms of how you apply those adjustments and how that support is provided to the students throughout the course,” Sladdin said. Sladdin said there was an obligation for universities under the Equality Act to provide support for disabled students, including for their learning and assessment, meaning universities needed to have “effective systems in place to manage that”. The National Union of Students said the tragedy highlighted the mental health struggles faced by many students at universities and colleges. An NUS spokesperson said: “We extend our sympathies to Natasha Abrahart’s friends and family after today’s judgment. We are deeply concerned about the mental health crisis, which is only getting worse for students.” Susan Lapworth, interim chief executive of the Office for Students (OfS), the higher education regulator for England, said Bristol and other institutions “will want to carefully consider this judgment” and ensure they are taking steps in response. “All universities and colleges should have effective measures in place to support students experiencing mental health difficulties. This includes help with continuing their studies and providing access to effective support services,” Lapworth said. “The OfS will continue to work with a range of partners to help make sure that students from all backgrounds receive timely, tailored and appropriate support when they have concerns about their mental health.” A spokesperson for Universities UK said the sector was committed to identifying and supporting students who may be at risk. “Across the UK, we are seeing an increase in the number of young adults experiencing mental health difficulties, and this is reflected in higher education with increasing demand for student support services at our universities and NHS partners. “UUK has called on [the] government to provide urgent additional mental health funding for universities and to commission student-facing NHS services,” the spokesperson said. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic abuse helpline is 0808 2000 247. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

5/21/2022,"A refugee who fled the Nazis and was quietly taken in by the family of Clement Attlee in the run-up to the second world war, has died. Paul Willer, 94, escaped Germany in 1939 with his Jewish mother and brother after being sponsored by the then Labour leader. After their escape, the future prime minister, under whose leadership the NHS was founded, invited 10-year-old Willer to stay at the family home in Stanmore, north-west London, testimony and letters show. Attlee neither publicised nor sought to make political capital from his visitor, whose story was first told by the Guardian in 2018. The Association of Jewish Refugees (AJR) said Willer died on Friday. His daughter thanked the association for securing financial help and said his life had a “happy ending”. Willer was raised with his younger brother by his mother, Franziska, in the Bavarian town of Würzburg. Their father, Johannes, a Christian, left their mother in 1933, began a new relationship and declared himself to be a Nazi sympathiser. Franziska, a doctor, struggled to find work and look after her children. She decided to leave Germany after witnessing the antisemitic violence of Kristallnacht (“night of broken glass”) on 9 November 1938. The family was advised that because the children were seen as “half Aryan”, they might struggle to qualify for the Kindertransport scheme, which helped mainly Jewish children. A faint hope eventually came after her London-based brother Otto contacted the Rev William Hewett, the rector of Stanmore. The clergyman sought the help of the Attlees, who were regular churchgoers, who agreed to take in Willer. At the time, Attlee was 56 and had been the leader of the Labour party for four years. Willer’s mother said in her memoirs that she used letters offering a place of refuge in the UK to persuade border guards to let her cross from Germany into the Netherlands and then on to the UK. In 2018, Willer recalled first entering the family home of Heywood in north London. “They took me inside what was a very large house. They had a maid and a cook too. The next morning, their son Martin [the late Lord Attlee], who was my age, took me upstairs and ran a cold bath, bathed and encouraged me to do the same. I thought, ‘Is this what they do for Easter?’ It turned out that cold baths were what the males in the family did every day,” he said. In contrast to the taciturn image of Attlee the politician, Willer’s lasting impression was of a happy, relaxed presence, he said. “He was a gentle man and a gentleman. He was very good with the children and affectionate. At breakfast, we would gather around the table and he played this game where he held out a coin and asked whose monarch’s head was on it. Whoever gave the correct answer was allowed to keep the coin,” he said. Just before the start of the war, Willer left the Attlee home for Northern Ireland. He eventually became a sales director at a textiles company, married, had three children and settled in Hertfordshire. He spent much of his later life in Gloucestershire. In 2018, Willer and his daughter Jo met with the grandchildren of Clement Attlee – Jo Roundell Greene and Lord Attlee – at the House of Lords. In a statement on Friday, Jo Willer said: “My father was lucky enough to have so much excitement in the last few years of his life. “The AJR was so good to put him forward for the Claims Conference scheme. That support and endorsement that he should have the right to remain in his own home and the financial help offered, gave me the confidence to enlist many wonderful people who he came to rely on and who loved helping him. His story had a happy ending,” she said. Willer loved sports cars and was regularly driving his bright yellow Audi TT until September, his relatives said. He passed away surrounded by his clocks, photographs, roses from the garden and his family.",News/World news,"Paul Willer, refugee from Nazis taken in by Attlee family, dies aged 94",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/paul-willer-refugee-from-nazis-taken-in-by-atlee-family-dies-aged-94
5/21/2022,"Pap Ndiaye, the renowned Black French historian and expert on US minority rights, has been appointed education minister for the start of Emmanuel Macron’s second term, as the country faces persistent social inequalities in the school system. “I’m a pure product of republican meritocracy,” Ndiaye said, referencing his mother who taught science at a middle school outside Paris. He said he was also “a symbol of diversity” which gave him a sense of “duty and responsibility” to the young people of France. Ndiaye, an expert on colonialism and the history of race relations on both sides of the Atlantic, was head of France’s Museum of Immigration and is seen as on the left. His appointment to Macron’s mix of rightwing and centre-left government ministers under the new prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, was a surprise. Ndiaye represents a break with the previous education minister, the rightwinger Jean-Michel Blanquer, who while in office founded his own thinktank to oppose what he called the US-imported “doctrine” of “wokism”. France has one of the most unequal school systems in the developed world. A pupil born and schooled in a deprived neighbourhood in France has less chance of escaping their socio-economic background than in most other developed nations, according to the OECD. Ndiaye, born outside Paris to a Senegalese father and French mother, gained national prominence with his 2008 work “The Black Condition, an essay on a French minority.” In an Associated Press interview last year, Ndiaye said France had to conquer racial injustice by confronting its often-violent colonial past, noting that “the French are highly reluctant to look at the dark dimensions of their own history.” Ndiaye, whose sister is the award-winning novelist, Marie NDiaye, told Le Monde in 2017 that structural racism existed in France, whereby institutions such as the police may have certain racist practices. Ndiaye was for many years a professor at the elite Sciences Po university in Paris. “In the field of history, he is someone who has been innovative and able to show a new way of understanding the past,” the historian Pascal Blanchard told AFP. “He’s a teacher who knows what it’s like to be in front of a class of students. In a diverse society, it is important to have someone who is attentive to diversity.” The far right’s Marine Le Pen swiftly attacked Ndiaye’s appointment, saying it symbolised “the deconstruction of our country, its values and future”. Macron is under pressure to deliver on his election promise of renewal and a “new method” for politics in his second-term, with less top-down leadership and more listening to voters’ concerns. He has been criticised by opposition parties for waiting almost a month after his April presidential win against Le Pen to finalise a new government to serve under Élisabeth Borne, France’s first woman prime minister in more than 30 years. The new government appointments mark the start of a bitter battle for next month’s parliamentary elections. Macron’s centrist grouping needs to win a solid parliament majority if he is to have a free-hand for his domestic overhaul of the pensions and benefits system, as well as changes to schools and the health-service. A historic left-wing alliance led by the radical left’s Jean-Luc Mélenchon is aiming to increase its seats. Catherine Colonna, France’s ambassador to London and a former spokesperson to late rightwing president Jacques Chirac, was appointed foreign minister, making her only the second woman to hold the job, after the right’s Michèle Alliot-Marie over a decade ago. Many of the government appointments were a continuation of Macron’s last term, with loyal ministers rewarded. Two key ministers on the right – Bruno Le Maire at the economy ministry and Gérald Darmanin at the interior ministry – both kept their seats. The justice minister Éric Dupond-Moretti also remained. Macron’s promised environmental drive for France to become “the first major nation to abandon gas, oil and coal” will be led by the prime minister with two ministers who had previously served in Macron’s first term: Amélie de Montchalin, and Agnès Pannier-Runacher.",News/World news,France: Black historian Pap Ndiaye appointed as education minister,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/france-black-historian-pap-ndiaye-appointed-as-education-minister
5/21/2022,"Leeds United and Burnley have written to the Premier League, asking it to investigate whether Everton broke spending rules during the pandemic and reserving the right to take legal action. The three clubs have been locked in a relegation struggle, with Everton securing their escape from the drop with victory over Crystal Palace on Thursday. Before that, their rivals asked for an inquiry that could lead to the Merseyside club being fined or docked points if found guilty. Everton say they have complied with the rules. According to claims first reported by the Times, Leeds and Burnley have asked for clarity over whether Everton’s losses of £371.8m over the past three years break financial fair play rules. The rules allow for maximum losses of £105m over a three-year period and, although they were adjusted to allow clubs to write off losses incurred because of the pandemic, the complainants argue that Everton’s apparent Covid losses are far larger than other clubs’. In their last accounts, Everton said £170m of their losses had been related to the pandemic. Aston Villa put their figure at £56m and Arsenal said £86m had been lost because of Covid. In March Everton’s CEO, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, wrote in the club’s annual accounts: “Losses of at least £170m are attributed to the impact on the club of the Covid-19 pandemic, with £103m of that figure coming in the 2020-21 financial year. “The wide-ranging impact of Covid-19 on Everton — which further market analysis has indicated could include an additional £50m — covers lost revenues, additional costs due to strict Covid-19 playing protocols and a significant contraction in the transfer market which resulted in the inability to generate the level of transfer fees which could reasonably have been expected pre-pandemic.” Leeds and Burnley are reported to want the league to appoint an independent commission to look at Everton’s records and decide on disciplinary measures, should they be deemed appropriate. Neither club would comment publicly on the letter. The Premier League also declined to comment. An Everton spokesperson said: “We have worked so closely with the Premier League to make sure we are compliant, we are comfortable we have complied with the rules. “External auditors have told us what we can and cannot claim against the pandemic. If they want to take legal action then they can do so by all means.”",Sport/Football,Leeds and Burnley ask Premier League to look into Everton over spending rules,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/20/leeds-burnley-ask-premier-league-investigate-everton-over-pandemic-spending-rules
5/21/2022,"Police chiefs will declare they are “ashamed” about racism remaining in law enforcement, and apologise for the “discrimination and bias” still plaguing forces in a new race plan launching next week. The plan from National Police Chiefs Council and College of Policing will avoid admitting institutional racism, which critics brand a failure which could doom the promised reforms. However, it will instead commit to be being “institutionally anti-racist”, and aim to start winning back the confidence of black people, which among black Caribbean people is 20% lower than the national average. They vow to end the treatment which black people find “stigmatising and humiliating”, and police chiefs from England and Wales will say: “We accept that policing still contains racism, discrimination and bias. We are ashamed of those truths, we apologise for them and we are determined to change them.” The plan, running to more than 50 pages, follows months of intense and at times bitter discussions. It was triggered by the mass protests after the murder of George Floyd in the United States by a police officer, and has taken so long it will be published just a day before the second anniversary of his death. The document and planned reforms comes after decades of promises by policing to stamp out racism in the ranks, and failure to deliver. In 1999, policing was declared to be institutionally racist by the Macpherson inquiry into the police blunders that allowed the racist murderers of Stephen Lawrence to escape justice after he was stabbed to death at a London bus stop. Policing has in large parts – especially in the Met –declared that the label no longer applies. The Guardian has revealed chiefs were debating a public declaration, almost a quarter of a century on from Macpherson, that policing remained so. Some chief constables and community experts they consulted insisted that accepting the label was the essential starting point to repair the damage, otherwise any plan risked never even getting a hearing from communities weary of promises and false claims they had been delivered. Police leaders could not agree to accept forces were still institutionally racist, even holding a vote The chiefs will say: “Much has been done in the intervening years by policing to address racism in the police and society. “Despite this, change has not been fast nor significant enough in Black communities. As we have prepared this plan, we have heard the views of Black people and their experiences of policing. We have listened to the voices of our own Black colleagues about the service they belong to. “The challenge for reform, set out by Macpherson, cannot be said to have been unambiguously answered by policing. Many people believe policing to still be institutionally racist and have grounds for this view.” The murder of George Floyd in the US saw over 250,000 people take to British streets in support of Black Live Matter and calls for racial justice in a phalanx of protests, despite the country being in lockdown. Discussions within policing with ethnic minority officers saw some chiefs realise the race problems in their forces were more severe than they had realised. The document says: “We have much to do to secure the confidence of Black people, including our own staff, and improve their experience of policing – and we will. We will be held to account and we welcome scrutiny. “That need for change is evident. Policing lags behind almost every part of the public service as an employer of choice for Black people. Confidence levels are much lower, and our powers are disproportionately applied to Black people. In some crimes, victimisation rates are higher. “Black officers and staff leave policing earlier in their careers than White staff and the fact we have only seen two Black officers reach chief constable or assistant commissioner rank in policing’s history is a failure. “ One chief constable who supports accepting policing is institutionally racist said: “All the figures show it still is.” One chief who opposed it said the label was “unhelpful” and not accurate. Victor Olisa, former head of diversity at Scotland Yard, said failing to admit institutional racism will blow the credibility of the new promises: “They may say they will do better, but without an admission of institutional racism, it won’t be believed in communities. “Police chiefs are being insular and doing what suits them and not the service of the public.” The chiefs will say the argument that policing reflects biases in society is not good enough: “Policing has a much higher obligation than any other public service, given its ability to deprive liberty and use the most intrusive powers. The collective trust of society is critical to a police service built upon consent.” Sources involved in discussions said while high on aspiration, the plan risked lacking specifics. Chiefs will adopt a policy of “explain or reform” on racial disparities, such as stop and search, and the plan will say: “Black people are seven times more likely to be stopped and searched than White people and five times more likely to be subjected to the use of force. Testimonies tell us that Black people find these encounters – particularly stop and search – confrontational, stigmatising and humiliating. “10% of our recorded searches, 27% of use-of-force incidents and 35% of Taser incidents involved someone from a Black ethnic group. The latest estimates suggest that only 3.5% of the population is Black.” Chiefs have brought in independent scrutiny and the public will be encouraged to give their views on the plan. The plan is produced by the NPCC and College of Policing and will now be consulted upon and may change. They state their aim is: “Our vision is for a police service that is anti-racist and trusted by Black people.”",News/UK news,"Police chiefs to apologise for ‘racism, discrimination and bias’ in race plan",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/20/police-chiefs-to-apologise-for-racism-discrimination-and-bias-in-race-plan
5/21/2022,"The ATP and the WTA have decided to penalise Wimbledon for its decision to ban Russian and Belarusian players from the tournament by stripping ranking points from the tournament this year. The decision marks the most significant split among the tennis governing bodies in a long time. It means that Wimbledon will essentially be rendered an exhibition event in the tennis ecosystem, with players unable to earn the ranking points this year as they do at all other official tournaments. Those who performed well at last year’s edition will be unable to defend their points, meaning there could be significant disruption to the rankings. “The ability for players of any nationality to enter tournaments based on merit, and without discrimination, is fundamental to our Tour,” said the ATP in a statement. “The decision by Wimbledon to ban Russian and Belarusian players from competing in the UK this summer undermines this principle and the integrity of the ATP Ranking system. It is also inconsistent with our Rankings agreement. Absent a change in circumstances, it is with great regret and reluctance that we see no option but to remove ATP Ranking points from Wimbledon for 2022.” In their statements, both the ATP and WTA stressed that by banning Russian and Belarusian players, Wimbledon have breached their rankings agreements: “The recent decisions made by the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) and the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) to ban athletes from competing in the upcoming UK grass court events violate that fundamental principle, which is clearly embodied in the WTA rules, the Grand Slam rules, and the agreement the WTA has with the Grand Slams,” said the WTA. Additionally, the ITF has announced the removal of points from the juniors and wheelchair tournaments at Wimbledon. Late on Friday night, the All England Club responded to the governing bodies by expressing their “deep disappointment” at the ATP, WTA and ITF’s positions and affirming their own decision: “Given the position taken by the UK Government to limit Russia’s global influence, which removed automatic entry by ranking, and the widespread response of Government, industry, sport and creative institutions, we remain of the view that we have made the only viable decision for Wimbledon as a globally renowned sporting event and British institution, and we stand by the decision we have made,” said the All England Club. In April, Wimbledon announced that they would not allow Russian or Belarusian players to compete at the tournament in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The All England Club cited the possibility of the Russian government using any Russian player’s success as propaganda during the invasion and the British government’s guidelines as reasons for the decision. With the significant popularity and revenue generated by grand slam tournaments, withholding ranking points is one of the few options the tours have to exert power over Wimbledon. Russian and Belarusian players have been allowed to compete elsewhere as neutral athletes and they will be present at the French Open, which begins on Sunday. The ATP additionally contested Wimbledon’s assertions that their choices were limited by guidance from the UK government: “We greatly value our long-standing relationships with Wimbledon and the LTA and do not underestimate the difficult decisions faced in responding to recent UK Government guidance. However, we note that this was informal guidance, not a mandate, which offered an alternative option that would have left the decision in the hands of individual players competing as neutral athletes through a signed declaration.” The Guardian understands that there is a significant split among players over both Wimbledon’s initial decision and the reaction from the tennis governing bodies. While some players have previously registered their discomfort at Wimbledon’s initial decision and the ATP player council recommended the withdrawal of ranking points, over 90 players have opposed the points deduction, with some writing to the tours and criticising the player councils for not representing their views. Despite the LTA’s decision to follow Wimbledon’s lead by refusing entry to players in the ATP and WTA lead-up events, both tours have also opted to maintain points at the British warm-up tournaments. However, the LTA and its tournaments will face disciplinary action from the WTA. Aleksandr Dolgopolov, a recently retired Ukrainian player who returned to Ukraine in order to enlist in the army, criticised the decisions of the tennis governing bodies on social media: “Well done @atptour and @WTA, you made the N1 propagandist of russia happy by taking away points from Wimbledon. Probably will make it all over the rest of russian propaganda. Very poor decision. Can’t sit on 2 chairs,” he said. While the possibility of Russian and Belarusian players initiating legal action against Wimbledon has been a point of discussion, Daniil Medvedev, the Russian ATP No 2 and highest profile player unable to compete at Wimbledon, gave his perspective towards the ban during his press conference on Friday: “[It’s] not me taking these decisions, if I can’t play, I’m not going to go to court for this one.”",Sport/Sport,Wimbledon stripped of ranking points over ban on Russian players,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/20/wimbledon-stripped-of-ranking-points-over-banning-of-russian-players-tennis
5/21/2022,"Nadine Dorries’ claim that a Channel 4 reality show she appeared on used paid actors is “unfounded”, according to the production company that made the show. The culture secretary told parliament on Thursday that she believes the 2010 show ‘Tower Block of Commons’, in which she was one of a number of MPs who went to live in deprived communities, used paid actors to play supposedly real people. Her claim is of deep concern to Channel 4 as Dorries is currently trying to push through the privatisation of the state-owned but commercially funded broadcaster. Any suggestion that a show she appeared on might have been faked could have severe consequences for the broadcaster’s future. Dorries told the culture select committee on Thursday that she thought the show had hired paid actors for the programme. On the reality show Dorries was sent to live in South Acton estate in west London, sparking a minor scandal when the MP was revealed to have smuggled in a £50 note, which she claimed was intended to buy gifts for the children of her hosts. She told parliament she believed the hosts were planted by the show’s producers. “I discovered later, they were actually actors,” she told MPs. “The parents of the boys in that programme actually came here to have lunch with me, and contacted me to tell me, actually, they were in acting school, and that they weren’t really living in a flat, and they weren’t real. And even, if you remember, there’s a pharmacist or somebody that I went to see who prepared food – she was also a paid actress as well.” Love Productions, which made the programme and also makes The Great British Bake Off, said it believed her allegation was false but pledged to investigate if the culture secretary had any evidence. A spokesperson said: “Love Productions does not use actors to impersonate contributors in any of its documentary or constructed factual series. Nadine Dorries took part in the making of Tower Block of Commons for Channel 4 alongside other genuine contributors, and we are confident that her claims are unfounded. “Nevertheless, we take the allegations seriously and will investigate thoroughly. We also await Nadine Dorries’ reply to Channel 4’s request for evidence to back up her comments.” Dorries told parliament that Channel 4 would be privatised, despite widespread opposition from the media industry. Channel 4 has also pushed back hard on some of her other evidence to the select committee, including her claim that the broadcaster is not invested in the government’s levelling up programme and her suggestion Channel 5 spends more on regional commissioning.",News/Politics,Production outfit refutes Nadine Dorries’ claims Channel 4 faked reality show,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/20/production-outfit-refutes-nadine-dorries-claims-channel-4-faked-reality-show
5/21/2022,"Intense fighting has been reported around the Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk as Russian forces appear to be stepping up an offensive to encircle its Ukrainian defenders. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the eastern provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk – known collectively as the Donbas – were being turned into “hell” and warned that what he called the “final stage of the war” would be the bloodiest. Russian troops fired on a school in Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraine’s Luhansk region, killing three adults, according to a Ukrainian official. More than 200 people, including children, were sheltering at the school when the attack took place this morning, the head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration, Serhiy Haidai, said. Ukrainian soldiers have finally ended their defence of the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, according to the commander of Ukraine’s Azov regiment, Denys Prokopenko. In a video statement, Prokopenko said civilians and heavily wounded Ukrainian fighters have been evacuated from the plant. A Ukrainian fighter who shared a series of powerful photographs while defending the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol appears to have been taken captive by Russian forces. Dmytro Kozatskyi posted a link to a Google drive containing images he had taken inside the plant, writing: “Well, that’s all. Thank you from the shelter, Azovstal is the place of my death and my life.” G7 industrialised nations have pledged $19.8bn (£15.9bn or €18.7bn) to bolster Ukraine’s public finances as Kyiv battles Russia’s invasion. Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner, told reporters that $9.5bn of the total was mobilised at meetings of the G7 finance ministers in Königswinter, Germany, this week. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, warned that Moscow is forming 12 new units in its western military district in response to Finland and Sweden’s Nato bid. He also said that almost 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers who were barricaded in Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks have surrendered so far. The number of combatants who have surrendered has not been independently verified. Russia will stop gas flows to neighbouring Finland on Saturday morning, Finnish state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum said. Gasum CEO, Mika Wiljanen, described the news as “regrettable” and sought to reassure customers that there would be enough gas in the coming months. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said he will speak to Finland on Saturday regarding its bid to join Nato and maintained his opposition to Finland and Sweden’s membership bids. Erdoğan told reporters he had discussed the issue with the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, and that he would also be speaking to Britain tomorrow. A Russian tank commander who pleaded guilty earlier this week to shooting dead an unarmed Ukrainian civilian has said he will accept any punishment from the court. Vadim Shysimarin, 21, told courtroom No 201 of the Kyiv tribunal that he “was nervous about what was going on” on the day 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov died and said he “didn’t want to kill”. It was the third day of the first war crimes trial resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine. The United States has accused Russia of holding the world’s food supply hostage amid growing fears of famine in developing countries. Dmitry Medvedev, a former president of Russia, warned that Russia would not continue food supplies unless the west eased its sanctions on the Kremlin. Russia’s lower house of parliament has published on its website a proposal to change the law to allow Russians over 40 and foreigners over 30 to sign up for the military. Previously only Russians aged 18-40 and foreigners aged 18-30 could enter into a first contract with the military. US intelligence officials are reportedly sceptical that Vladimir Putin would be persuaded to end the war in Ukraine even if there was a dramatic change in Russian public opinion. Officials also doubt the war is likely to lead to the removal of the Russian president from power, at least in the short term, CNN reports.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 86 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-86-of-the-invasion
5/21/2022,"Boris Johnson is among dozens of No 10 officials warned by Sue Gray they are facing criticism in her Partygate report next week, as a former civil service chief said the “real issue” was the leadership of the prime minister and his cabinet secretary, Simon Case. Johnson is one of 20 to 30 current and former staffers who have been notified by letter that accounts of their conduct will feature in her final report on the lockdown-busting parties. This is now likely to be published next week after Scotland Yard handed out 126 fixed-penalty notices to people from No 10, including one for Johnson but many for more junior staff. On Friday night, it emerged Johnson and Gray had a private meeting about the investigation some weeks ago, although sources on both sides insisted the contents of the report was not discussed. One described it as a progress meeting taking stock of the process. Whitehall sources said the report was likely to be heavily critical of the culture that arose in the civil service, which Johnson has attempted partly to address this week with a shake-up of his No 10 operation to bring more under his own control. However, Bob Kerslake, a crossbench peer and former leader of the civil service, said Partygate was “about conduct and behaviours that can’t be dealt with by changing structures”. He said: “It could improve efficiency but I’m not sure that in itself could have altered the course of events when the real issue was the leadership at the top, truthfully with the prime minister, and I have to say potentially with the cabinet secretary but until we see Sue’s report it is hard to make that judgment.” Case is not among those who received a fixed penalty, despite a party in his office having been under investigation. He was due to appear at the public administration committee next week but has pulled out, leading its Tory chairman, William Wragg, to say it “puts government transparency in a poor light”. He added: “The session with the cabinet secretary was an important one considering the number of propriety and ethics issues on the agenda.” Asked why Case had pulled out, a Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “The cabinet secretary and director general for property and ethics have been rescheduled to appear at the committee in June.” The cabinet secretary, who formerly headed up the civil service in No 10, is the subject of considerable anger among officials, many of whom feel they have been unfairly penalised after cooperating with the Gray report – unlike their superiors. Gary Graham, a deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, suggested in a BBC interview on Friday that the prime minister should consider his position. He said the key issue in the Gray report should be “who were the key decision-makers in No 10 and who set the culture … there were a number of quite catastrophic decisions made at senior level, including by the prime minister, and those should not be put at the door of junior staff.” A spokesperson for the PCS, the union that represents 180,000 civil servants and will next week vote on national strike action, was also highly critical of the way junior civil servants appeared to have been punished for events that were known about by more senior staff. “It’s one rule for the prime minister, cabinet ministers and senior civil servants who organised the Downing Street parties, another for junior staffers,” he said. “Once again, this government shows little – or no – respect to our members who worked so hard keeping the country going during the pandemic.” Whitehall sources said No 10 had been pressing for Gray’s report to be published as early as Monday, giving those sent warning letters the weekend to respond if they wish. But the report is understood to be more likely to come midweek, given some of the recipients of warning letters may want to challenge the findings or even hire lawyers to dispute any facts. Not all of those sent a letter will be named, but they have been sent summaries of how their conduct is portrayed in the report. No 10 said on Friday it was not blocking the release of any names, which are likely to be at senior civil service level only. After Gray’s report is published and Johnson makes a statement to the Commons giving his own account of the Partygate saga, the prime minister is keen to turn public attention to his government’s response to the cost of living crisis. He told the Conservative conference in Wales on Friday that he wanted to “use the firepower we have built up to put our arms around people, just as we did during the pandemic”. There had been speculation that No 10 and No 11 could come to an agreement on help for households, including measures to help people with bills, by the middle of next week. But despite Johnson’s hint of help to come, a Treasury source played down the idea of an imminent move, suggesting it was unlikely an announcement from Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, would come before the House of Commons rises for a Whitsun recess next Thursday. “Rishi is still looking at a whole variety of options, and hasn’t settled yet on what the best way forward is: we’re a bit of a way off,” the source said. Options under consideration include an expansion of the existing warm homes discount, which cuts the energy bills of the poorest consumers; another one-off payment like the council tax cut that came into force in April; or much more costly across-the-board interventions such as a VAT cut, or bringing forward the income tax reduction planned for 2024. With a potential delay to the announcement on cost of living, Conservative backbenchers are concerned about political drift, and have urged Johnson’s team to “knuckle down” in the weeks ahead. “There’s a lot of frustration that although there are some departments doing good things, there’s nothing that threads it all together: there’s no central theme, there’s no central purpose,” said one former minister. “If I were in No 10, instead of feeling exuberant I would be knuckling down.” MPs expressed bemusement at the Met’s handling of the investigation, with one describing what they called colleagues’ “general mystification”, adding: “It does seem very unclear as to how some people at the same event have been fined and not others.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson among dozens warned they face criticism in Sue Gray’s report,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/20/boris-johnson-among-dozens-warned-face-criticism-sue-gray-report-partygate
5/21/2022,"Ginni Thomas, the wife of the US supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, pressed Republicans in Arizona to overturn Joe Biden’s victory there in 2020, the Washington Post reported. Repeating Donald Trump’s lie that the vote had been marred by fraud, Thomas wrote: “Please stand strong in the face of political and media pressure. Please reflect on the awesome authority granted to you by our constitution. And then please take action to ensure that a clean slate of electors is chosen for our state.” Thomas did not mention Biden or Trump. But, the Post said, “the context was clear”. Biden won Arizona, a swing state vital to the contest, by about 10,000 votes. The call was first made by Fox News, enraging Trump. Ginni Thomas is an activist with deep ties on the Republican far right. Reports of her involvement in Trump’s attempt to hold on to power have led to calls for her husband’s impeachment and removal, or at least recusal from election-related cases. In January, Thomas was the only justice to say Trump should be able to withhold from the House committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack documents which turned out to include texts sent by his wife to Trump’s chief of staff. On Friday, the Post said Ginni Thomas emailed two Arizona Republicans on 9 November, six days after election day and two days after Biden’s win was called. She also requested a live or online meeting “so I can learn more about what you are doing to ensure our state’s vote is audited and our certification is clean”. One of the lawmakers, Shawnna Bolick, replied, saying, “I hope you and Clarence are doing great!” but deflecting the demand for a meeting. The Post said Thomas replied: “Fun that this came to you! Just part of our campaign to help states feel America’s eyes!!!” The Post also reported that Thomas emailed the same Republicans on 13 December, a day before the electoral college met to confirm Biden’s victory. That email said: “Before you choose your state’s electors … consider what will happen to the nation we all love if you don’t stand up and lead.” The Post said the email contained a link to a video of a man who appeared to be Geoffrey Botkin, an activist, “delivering a message meant for swing-state lawmakers, urging them to ‘put things right’ and ‘not give in to cowardice’ [and saying] ‘You have only hours to act’.” The video is no longer available. Botkin did not comment to the newspaper. Nor did Ginni Thomas. The Post said a supreme court spokesperson did not respond. On 14 December, the day the electoral college confirmed Biden’s win, Bolick signed a letter calling for Arizona’s electoral votes to go to Trump or “be nullified completely until a full forensic audit can be conducted”. In 2021, Arizona Republicans conducted a controversial vote audit. It did not reveal substantial electoral fraud. It did increase Biden’s margin of victory. Also in 2021, the New Yorker reported that Bolick had introduced a bill that “would enable a majority of the legislature to override the popular vote … and dictate the state’s electoral college votes itself”. Like Trump loyalists elsewhere, Bolick is now running for secretary of state, the office which runs elections. On Friday, the New Yorker reporter Jane Meyer tweeted “one additional detail”, linking Ginni Thomas’s moves in Arizona back to her husband. Clarence Thomas, Meyer said, is godfather “to Clint Bolick’s child, and Bolick’s wife is the Arizona lawmaker who Ginni Thomas pressured to overturn the 2020 election. “No conflicts of interest?”",News/US news,Ginni Thomas reportedly urged Arizona Republicans to overturn 2020 result,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/20/ginni-thomas-2020-election-arizona-emails
5/21/2022,"The horrors associated with a violent mob rampaging around the US Capitol last year meant a subsequent decision relating to a golf tournament barely registered. Donald Trump’s Bedminster golf course had been announced as the 2022 US PGA Championship’s host venue in 2014. With Trump caught in the middle of the Capitol storm, the PGA of America changed its plan, and Southern Hills in Tulsa, Oklahoma was the beneficiary at short notice. “We find ourselves in a political situation not of our making,” said Seth Waugh, the PGA of America’s chief executive. “We’re fiduciaries for our members, for the game, for our mission and for our brand. And how do we best protect that? Our feeling was given the tragic events that we could no longer hold it at Bedminster. “The damage could have been irreparable. The only real course of action was to leave.” It was a fine call then, just as it is now. Trump, once such an advocate of the PGA Tour, has shuffled off to form a dubious alliance with Saudi Arabia. His Doral course in Miami will stage the closing event of this year’s LIV Golf Series, funded by the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund. The partnership feels perfectly appropriate. If there is a widespread and a perfectly reasonable sense that golf has suffered through the R&A’s understandable refusal to stage the Open Championship at Trump-owned Turnberry, this US PGA switch has been an unquestionable success. Southern Hills was a strong course in 2001 and 2007 – when it staged the US Open and US PGA respectively – but has been elevated by changes overseen by the renowned course architect Gil Hanse. Days one and two in Tulsa have seen every facet of golf tested; as is precisely the way it should be in a major. The showcasing of this course to a broader audience has been entirely worthwhile. “We were trying to be truthful to the original design,” said Hanse of his Southern Hills project. He had used old photographs with that in mind. This largely related to the restoration of slopes around greens, as were created by the original architect of this course, Perry Maxwell. With typical modesty, Hanse has said he does not want his “fingerprints” visible here. Instead a sense of: “This is what Perry Maxwell did.” Hanse, though, is the name on every player’s lips. “Gil has done a fantastic job of altering the golf course,” said Tiger Woods. “It has a lot more shot options, that’s for sure, and we are tested around the greens a lot. A lot of grain, a lot of creativity, but it still puts a premium in putting the ball in play and in the fairway and somehow below the holes in the right spots.” In short, one dimensional golf is not an option. Bunkers are to be avoided. They are designed to penalise loose shots, after all. The sand at Southern Hills is more gritty than players are used to, as has triggered some noticeably poor attempts to get balls close to pins. “I am sure people have seen from watching the coverage how difficult it is to get spin, basically impossible,” explained Justin Thomas. “Some bunker shots that are generally pretty easy or guaranteed up-and-downs? That is definitely not the case this week.” It is the job of Kerry Haigh, the PGA of America’s chief championships officer, to set the course up. He is delighted with his platform. “They did an incredible job,” Haigh said of Hanse and his team. “They did a lot of different things, widened the landing areas of the fairways. They moved some of the bunkers back. They added five or six new tees for the back. “It provides a lot more shot options, a lot more shot variety, a lot more options to hit woods or drivers off the tee. If I’m a player, I’m going to enjoy playing what it offers.” Not that everyone has been in a positive state of mind. Scottie Scheffler, the world No 1, cracked his bag with a club in fit of pique yesterday morning. Dustin Johnson was hurtling towards a missed cut. As the wind whipped up, Thomas, Matt Fitzpatrick and Joaquín Niemann stood firm to keep pressure on Rory McIlroy before the Northern Irishman appeared for his afternoon tee time. The severity of the test on the morning of day two was emphasised by Woods, who moved up 17 spots on the leaderboard within five hours of play getting underway and without hitting a single shot.",Sport/Sport,Switching PGA courses after mob rampage a success for all bar Trump,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/20/switching-pga-courses-after-mob-rampage-a-success-for-all-bar-trump
5/21/2022,"A leading university has been ordered to pay £50,000 in damages to the parents of a vulnerable student who took her own life, after a senior judge ruled it had discriminated against her. In a landmark case that has deep implications for other higher education institutions, the parents of Natasha Abrahart successfully sued the University of Bristol under the Equality Act. Abrahart, 20, a physics undergraduate who suffered from severe social anxiety, died a day before she was due to give a “terrifying” oral exam in front of teachers and fellow students. Her parents, Robert and Margaret Abrahart, claim failings at the university played a vital role in their daughter’s death, and called for the government to meet them and other parents who have lost children, in order to find ways of improving the care universities provide to vulnerable students. Speaking outside court, Robert Abrahart, himself a retired university lecturer, said: “There are no winners or losers. Natasha is dead and the university’s reputation is in tatters. “Today, 1,481 days after Natasha took her own life on the day of an assessment she simply couldn’t do, after years of protestations from the university that it did all it could to support her, after having battled our way through an inquest and a civil trial, we finally have the truth: the University of Bristol broke the law and exposed our daughter to months of unnecessary psychological trauma, as she watched her grades plummet, and her hopes for the future crumble before her eyes.” Natasha’s mother, Margaret Abrahart, a retired psychological wellbeing practitioner, said she had gone to the cemetery to apologise to her daughter before taking the university to court. “She would have hated this attention,” she said. Abrahart was one of 11 University of Bristol students to kill themselves in a three-year period between 2016 and 2018. Mrs Abrahart said that when she and her husband realised that other students were suffering and others had died, not just at Bristol but at universities across the country, they felt they had to act. Abrahart, 20, was found dead at her flat in April 2018, shortly before she was to take part in a presentation to staff and students in a large lecture theatre. Her parents sued the university under the Equality Act for not taking reasonable care of their daughter’s wellbeing, health and safety, arguing it did not do enough to help her despite staff knowing she had a disability and was struggling deeply. In a judgment issued on Friday at Bristol county court, judge Alex Ralton said: “There can be no doubt that there was direct discrimination, especially once the university knew or should have known that a mental health disability of some sort was preventing Natasha from performing.” He found the university breached its duties to make reasonable adjustments to the way it assessed Abrahart and treated her unfavourably. The judge noted that “it was accepted by the medical experts that the primary stressor and cause of Natasha’s depressive illness was oral assessment”. Mr Abrahart said his daughter had gone to Bristol to study a subject she loved. He said: “She was bright, she was diligent, and she was hardworking. In a document we found on her computer after her death she said: ‘I love the idea of being able to understand (or at least notice) the rules that nature follows.’ Natasha would have made an excellent physicist if only the university hadn’t discriminated against her.” Abrahart said his daughter struggled to speak to people she did not know, particularly people in positions of authority. “Expecting Natasha to take part in oral assessments was like expecting a student in a wheelchair to take an exam in a room at the top of a long flight of stairs.” He said the prospect of her contributing to a group presentation in a large lecture theatre would have been “truly terrifying”, adding: “Instead of attending that session, she took her own life.” He said the adjustments that his daughter needed to succeed were “so simple, so obvious. It beggars belief that the university has spent the last four years arguing that they were not required to make them”. Mrs Abrahart said she felt the university was still not listening and called for it to apologise. “We really hope that the University of Bristol will finally take its head out of the sand and recognise that now is the time for change.” The court heard that in the months before her death, there was a “significant deterioration in her mental health”. In February 2018 she emailed one university employee, saying: “I’ve been having suicidal thoughts and to a certain degree attempted it.” Abrahart’s parents stressed they are not blaming individual staff. Her mother said: “We do however blame the university as an institution. We blame the university for not training its staff properly in its duties towards disabled students and on when they could and should share information internally about students who are at risk of suicide. We blame the university for the role it played in our daughter’s death.” The university has argued that it had tried to offer Abrahart alternatives to the oral presentation. But the judge observed that, “whilst a few ideas” regarding possible adjustments were “floated” by the university, “none were implemented”. A University of Bristol spokesperson said: “Our whole university community has been deeply affected by Natasha’s tragic death. We believe staff in the school of physics worked incredibly hard and diligently to support Natasha and it was due to their efforts that she was receiving specialist mental health support from the NHS. “Our staff’s efforts also included offering alternative options for Natasha’s assessments to alleviate the anxiety she faced about presenting her laboratory findings to her peers. “Given the significant impact this decision could have on how all higher education providers support their students, we are reviewing the decision carefully, including whether to appeal.” In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

5/21/2022,"I readily identified with Owen Jones’s important article (Why homophobia against straight men matters, 17 May). Though the memories are decades old now – I went to a Catholic boys’ grammar school in Liverpool from 1976 to 1983 – the homophobic abuse I received is still very clear in my mind. While the school I went to wasn’t “rough”, a lot of the lads were still “hard”. I wasn’t. I was just different, in the way I looked and spoke. I am not gay, but that didn’t matter. My classmates rewarded my difference with a daily diet of homophobic insults. The masculine examples I had grown up with showed a different view of what it was “to be a man”. That is, being kind, gentle, caring, sharing household duties, very involved with bringing up the kids, and not spending hours in the pub. My dad was also something of a counsellor to his friends: “ordinary” blokes who, I later found out, would confide to him problems that were taboo at the time, eg erectile dysfunction. Sadly, he died when I was 12. I didn’t really have any friends at school until I was 16. I had hard-won respect from my peers, but at some cost. I still detest all-male, macho and misogynistic attitudes and environments. I often prefer talking to women than men (though I have good male friends). I also appear an ordinary bloke: married with two kids. I firmly believe that being an ordinary bloke can and should encompass the qualities my dad showed me. And I have never mastered the simian stroll.John GoughCoventry  I’ve been subject to comments of the type noted in Owen Jones’s article my whole adult life (I’m 57). In writing to you, my first impulse is to perhaps explain why people might think that I’m gay – but why should I have to explain myself? For me and for my experiences, the line “it is principally about policing the boundaries of masculinity” really strikes a chord. But I flatly refuse to let one narrow group of men be the guardians of what “being a man” is. Men who love men, men who have sex with men, are masculine men as far as I’m concerned. I can’t change the world by myself, but my act of defiance in the face of this mindless homophobia is to never tell people that I’m actually straight.Trevor SmeatonDormansland, Surrey  Thanks for Owen Jones’s important article on homophobic bullying of straight men. I think he is spot-on in his conclusion that it is a form of policing what masculinity is allowed to be. My daughter recently told me of the ribbing of a straight male school student in her cohort for studying dance and drama. She is 17. I would rather have hoped we would have moved on from this narrow view of what a boy or man is or can do. She sympathised with him because she was called a “lesbian” for being part of a women’s football team. Surely it is a sign that there is still so much to do to have LGBTQ people accepted in mainstream society that they are being used as sticks to beat straight people into conformity.Name and address supplied  I agree with Owen Jones. His piece shines a light on how homophobia is a very serious hate crime and should be understood at every level of society for what it really is, affecting as it does gays, straights and people from ethnic minorities. I know it can only be tackled by education within schools and universities. It should be a big part of sexual education in general for all ages into adulthood. I experienced this form of bullying at school, which made me hide my real sexuality until I reached my mid-50s. Unfortunately, I was the subject of homophobic hate in Notting Hill a few months back, which was both abusive and violent. I’m 73, so you see how serious this problem is. The police do take these matters seriously and arrested the man.

5/21/2022,"With regard to Peter Tatchell’s article (No thanks, Ma’am. For LGBT campaigners like me, your jubilee is nothing to celebrate, 15 May), perhaps it can be suggested to Mr Tatchell that republicanism has, historically as well as now, never gained ground in the UK and that republican nations are just as guilty – if not more so – of many of the things that Mr Tatchell accuses the monarchy of. The monarchy in the UK is immensely popular, albeit with a small core of detractors. The monarchy may be drawn from a “small circle” of society, but the US presidency is no less guilty of such a charge. Slavery and war? Were not some of the early US presidents themselves slaveowners, with Thomas Jefferson fathering children by an enslaved black woman? The US still has a far worse race relations record than the UK. Did republican France not have an empire? Yes, it did, with Vietnam still recovering from that period, which included war with France and the US. France still struggles with its treatment of the Algerian Harkis. Is not republican Russia now engaged in an awful war in Ukraine, a war with little logical basis? As such, Mr Tatchell’s somewhat caustic view of the royal family is out of kilter with established fact. War, slavery and lack of social mobility are not limited to monarchical nations. Perhaps Mr Tatchell should read the writings of Sunder Katwala, a former republican turned monarchist.Ian RobertsVice-chair, British Monarchist League  It appears that Peter Tatchell is unaware that, as long ago as 2006, the Oxford Friend Lesbian and Gay Helpline – we had yet formally to include trans people among the groups with whom we worked – was awarded the Queen’s award for voluntary service by groups in the community. It seemed like a landmark at the time, and I believe that we were the first LGBT group in the country to be thus recognised. The award, and its presentation at Oxford town hall, were widely reported in the local press.Harry DickinsonOxford  I applaud Peter Tatchell for not succumbing to the “monarchy machine”, resisting the seduction and sycophancy, and sticking to his republicanism, unlike other critics who are drawn in by the dubious honour system. Polls show that there are about 25% of us who support a republic and a good percentage who are indifferent to the monarchy. These numbers will grow when the Queen goes.Jenny BushellWimbledon, London  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/21/2022,"Thank you for the heartening piece by Michael Morpurgo (‘My spelling isn’t that great’, 18 May). When I started teaching English in 1971, we were free from restrictions on how to do it, so it was enjoyable, creative and challenging. The rot started to set in with Kenneth Baker’s prescriptive national curriculum in 1989, which prompted me to leave classroom English teaching. I pity those who remain, forced to follow Michael Gove’s even worse impositions on our young learners. Morpurgo’s analysis reminds me of a criticism of that approach to testing: “You don’t fatten a pig by weighing it.”Alasdair DonaldsonMaidenhead, Berkshire  Michael Morpurgo is spot-on. Our nine-year-old granddaughter is expected to know grammatical terms I never came across at grammar school in the 60s. If the Conservatives have any education policy at all, it is to replace it in state schools with mere instruction. Another example: at primary school in the 50s we did division; for our children in the 70s and 80s it was sharing, which made so much more sense; now, for our grandchildren, it’s back to division. What does that say about our society?Joy WebbPenistone, South Yorkshire  Pass notes (Rebranding maths as numeracy? It doesn’t add up, 19 May), in making the case for better numeracy, perpetuates a frequent confusion of maths with arithmetic. The latter is about addition, subtraction, multiplication etc – all essential for numeracy. Maths is about the abstract science of numbers and does require some effort to master. As someone who did well at maths but failed O-level arithmetic, I can attest that the latter is not necessary to excel at the former.

5/21/2022,"The electric guitar played by Kurt Cobain in the Smells Like Teen Spirit music video will be put up for sale this weekend by Julien’s Auctions. Speaking about the 1969 Fender Mustang during his final interview with Guitar World, Cobain said: “I’m left-handed, and it’s not very easy to find reasonably priced, high-quality left-handed guitars. But out of all the guitars in the whole world, the Fender Mustang is my favorite. I’ve only owned two of them.” The starting estimate is $600,000 to $800,000. It is currently on display in Seattle’s Museum of Pop Culture where it has been for the past 12 years. Smells Like Teen Spirit is considered the seminal Generation X song – as NPR’s Joel Rose wrote, “an anthem for a generation that didn’t want one” . Released in 1991, its instantly recognizable guitar riff served as a bridge that transitioned mainstream pop music from the “hairband” era of the 1980s into the “alternative” grunge era of the early 1990s. “Smells Like Teen Spirit is an unusual anthem because it refuses the role of the anthem,” said NPR music critic Ann Powers. “It’s perfect for the generation it represented because this was a cohort that was so ambivalent about any traditional values [or] conventional success.” It got its name after Cobain’s girlfriend Tobi Vail’s bandmate in Bikini Kill, Kathleen Hanna, who had been laughing together at the deodorant brand Teen Spirit (“I mean, who names a deodorant Teen Spirit? What does teen spirit smell like? Like a locker room? Like pot mixed with sweat? Like the smell when you throw up in your hair at a party?” she told Double J) was drunkenly wrecking Cobain’s apartment for fun and wrote “Kurt smells like Teen Spirit” in Sharpie on the wall. “I took that as a compliment,” he said. After Cobain and Vail broke up, he told Rolling Stone, he set out to write “the ultimate pop song”, reportedly hoping to call it Anthem, though Vail pointed out that Bikini Kill already had a song with that name. The result, he said, was a riff that was deliberately “cliched” and, he felt, too similar to Boston’s More Than a Feeling: the band did not want it to be the album’s first single but were overruled. The video, shot on a soundstage in Culver City, California, features bored and distraught students sitting on bleachers, cheerleaders wearing the anarchy symbol and head-banging teenagers that eventually end up “tearing the place to shreds,” as Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl described it. The band had handed out flyers to their audience at the Roxy in West Hollywood two days before the shoot, asking everyone to show up for the video. The destruction at the end of the video, following a 12-hour day, was reportedly real. Cobain himself hated the attention the song received. “Everyone has focused on that song so much,” he told Rolling Stone. “The reason it gets a big reaction is people have seen it on MTV a million times. It’s been pounded into their brains.” Other items that will be on auction this weekend include Cobain’s 1965 Dodge Dart 170 four-door sedan. According to Julien’s Auctions, it is the “only known surviving car that was owned and driven” by Cobain. The car, nicknamed Baby Blue, is conservatively estimated at $400,000 to $600,000. An NFT of the green Fetalini striped short-sleeve sweater that Cobain wore in the video is also up for auction, with an estimated value of $6,000 to $8,000. The auction house said Kurt gave the actual sweater to his mother. A portion of the proceeds will go to Kicking the Stigma, a national initiative by the American football team Indianapolis Colts and their owner, Jim Irsay. The funds will be used to “raise awareness about mental health disorders and to remove the stigma too often associated with these illnesses”.",Arts/Music,Kurt Cobain’s Smells Like Teen Spirit electric guitar to be auctioned,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/20/kurt-cobain-guitar-auction
5/21/2022,"To dismiss the Metropolitan police investigation into Downing Street’s lockdown gatherings as a waste of time, as rightwing newspapers did on Friday, is grotesque. No police inquiry that resulted in 126 fines on 83 individuals from a single workplace for Covid breaches in a country in which more than 178,000 people have died from the virus should be described in that contemptuous way. No investigation that established widespread rule-breaking at the heart of government, where those very Covid rules were made, deserves to be brushed aside as entirely pointless, as the Daily Mail did. Yet the Met’s Operation Hillman inquiry was in many ways a sorry affair. It was a mistake not to investigate the parties much earlier. It was humiliating to then do a U-turn and launch an investigation under political and media pressure. It was foolish to apply rules of process that suggested special treatment for politicians. It was a misjudgment to suspend the operation during the local elections. It was wrong to wrap the whole exercise in so much secrecy. All this, though, was of a piece with many other inconsistencies in the way that the pandemic was policed around Britain. Most of the response to Operation Hillman has focused on the implications for politics. But what about the implications for policing? The handling of the Downing Street breaches has done further damage to the credibility of a force that is already reeling from other recent scandals about race and sex. The Downing Street investigation has managed to offend almost everyone in some way, on the right as well as the left, in the civil service and the media as well as the Tory party, and above all among those who were bereaved by Covid. The police should be deeply concerned about this almost unanimous verdict. One particularly troubling suspicion from the Partygate inquiry is that police felt intimidated by the possible consequences of what they were looking into. In theory, Britain’s police are operationally independent. But it didn’t always feel that way during the past few months, including this week. Downing Street, after all, is the place where they have the final say on police spending, police numbers and police structures. The Met commissioner’s job is also currently vacant and the force leaderless. These will have been difficult factors to ignore absolutely. All this may be dismissed as speculative, but there is wider evidence that police accountability in Britain is not working as well as it should be. The state of policing report issued by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services in March states that “too many chief constables” currently lack confidence in the resilience of the boundary between political accountability and operational independence. In parts of the country, the report says, there is “an atmosphere of mistrust and fear” among police chiefs. In the worst cases, police efficiency and effectiveness have suffered and police leaders have been reluctant to put their heads above the parapet. Such a process may have applied in Operation Hillman too. The system of police accountability in England and Wales – to elected police and crime commissioners as well as some mayors – is a decade old this year. It has not been a success. Turnout for the elections is derisory. The elections put too much power in the hands of one person, and there have been some bad breakdowns in trust. London’s experience has been particularly turbulent, but it is not unique. Police operational independence ought to be a crucial defence for the public against the development of a police state. The current accountability system makes it harder to uphold and produces poorer outcomes. When no one is satisfied with a system, it is surely time to change it.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Partygate investigation: blame the system,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-partygate-investigation-blame-the-system
5/21/2022,"Mamma mia, here we go again, except this time it will be different. Abba will be back on stage next Friday to promote their reunion album, Voyage, with a stadium show that circumvents all the old jokes about rock dinosaurs by using cutting-edge holographic technology to capture them singing the songs, while retro-styling them to look as they did in their 1970s heyday. So they won’t actually be there at all. The production team behind this show breathlessly exclaimed that five weeks of filming was enough to capture the “soul” of Abba. A mixed reception for the album itself will not prevent the faithful from flocking to the custom-built stadium in east London for the six-month run, where their avatars will perform alongside a live band. Ever since they won the 1974 Eurovision song contest with Waterloo, Abba have been critic-proof. “No thank you for the music” is how the Guardian received their latest album. But everybody knows Abba’s tunes. The jukebox musical Mamma Mia! is the West End’s sixth longest-running show, and the film based on it remains the 20th highest-grossing film at the UK box office. Those who believe that the Voyage concerts will set a new precedent should take some heed of earlier attempts to do so. Dave Clark’s West End musical Time, in 1986, fatuously brought Sir Laurence Olivier back to the stage as a 14-foot high hologram. Until such time as someone attempted to reconstruct the Alps for a rock musical about Heidi, opined the New York Times, this was musical theatre’s “most sensational contrast between mountainous spectacle and molehill content”. But times have changed, and Abba, always so good at capturing the zeitgeist, may yet have done it again. The last two years have accelerated the move towards a hybrid culture that was already happening with cinema screenings of live shows. In terms of technology, it was a period of such rapid innovation that the pre-pandemic idea of recording an opera, ballet or play by sticking a couple of fixed cameras in front of the stage seems like prehistory. Experiments such as the livestreamed concert that Dua Lipa trialled back in 2020 don’t always work, but it would be a shame if they were abandoned. The move towards virtual “live” events chimes with evolving ideas of personal risk and the carbon economy. The four Abba members are now in their 70s. They and their entourages won’t be racking up air miles or exposing themselves nightly to new viral variants. For all the sequins and spectacle, there will only be 10 musicians on stage at the Abba stadium. And for 1970s nostalgists eager for a more embodied entertainment, there will always be Elton John. Voyage may turn out to be an innovative dead end, but its real value is as a reminder that a live show is a communal event, which draws its energy from the desire of people in the room to have a good time together. It will be a blast for their many fans to strap on those dancing shoes again, with a quartet of pop idols who will never age.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Abba: still rocking the room 40 years on | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/20/the-guardian-view-on-abba-still-rocking-the-room-40-years-on
5/21/2022,"Junior civil servants who did not want to attend lockdown-breaching parties held at 10 Downing Street risked being forced to take legal action and put their careers in jeopardy, a senior employment lawyer has said. The law expects people to stand up for themselves, experts have said, with employees largely expected to comply with their bosses. Whistleblowing legislation is rarely used because people are worried about repercussions. “You’re going to struggle as an employee to effectively have any protection against doing what your boss asks you to do unless it is unpleasant, discriminatory or illegal,” said Kathryn Evans, a partner and the head of employment law at Trethowans Solicitors. “But even if there is a legal breach, as in the case of these parties, the employee needs to decide whether to refuse and risk damaging their relationship with their boss. If they fear this might happen, they have no choice but to bring legal proceedings, which means being prepared to stand up and be counted – and accept that their relationship with their boss is probably at an end.” Philip Landau, a partner at Landau Law, agreed. “Deferring to their boss’s interpretation of the rules – even though those bosses wrote the rules – is not a plausible and credible defence. “If your boss puts you in the position where you feel you need to attend a party or lose their favour, there is actually no elegant or subtle way out of it,” he said. “If you feel exposed in this way, you may need to lodge a grievance to protect your position and if this doesn’t resolve matters, bring a case for constructive dismissal. This does mean resigning from your position, however.” Rustom Tata, a partner and chair at law firm DMH Stallard, said the “law expects people to be able to stand up for themselves. That’s really tough on employees but the situation here is whether they broke the law or they didn’t. Whether you knew it was the law or why you broke it is irrelevant.” But, said Tata, one of the general principles of employment law is that everybody should be subjected to an appropriate penalty. This, he pointed out, is said not to have happened in the case of the lockdown parties, where women and Downing Street staffers on low salaries have reportedly been disproportionately hit by fines. “Given that no police interviews took place and this all rested on questionnaires, if somebody junior is receiving a fixed-penalty notice for being honest about what they did, compared to somebody senior to them who doesn’t get fined, that isn’t fair,” said Tata. The question then is what the junior employee can do about it. “This is where it becomes very hard,” said Tata. “The junior employee doesn’t know who they’ve got beef with: is it their boss, who didn’t fill the form out honestly, or is it with the police for selective prosecution?” But Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, the trade union representing professionals and managers in public service, said junior civil servants may have attended the parties through choice – and senior civil servants may have been fined. “Clearly this is a unique environment where a relatively junior civil servant could be invited to something by some of the most senior people in the country but let’s not forget, there were civil servants who chose not to attend these parties,” he said. “We also don’t know who has been fined,” he added. “Junior civil servants might think they’re the only ones but because there’s no obligation to report it if you’ve received a fine, we don’t know who actually has.”",News/Law,"Junior staff could have risked career by not attending No 10 parties, lawyer says",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/may/20/junior-staff-could-risked-career-not-attending-no-10-parties-lawyer-says
