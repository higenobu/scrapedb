1/10/2022,"Twenty-six minutes of unseen footage of the vast and notoriously violent Altamont music festival held in northern California in 1969 have been unexpectedly uncovered. The home-movie footage – which is vividly shot on 8mm film, but frustratingly silent – has been published by the Library of Congress on its website.  It is not known who filmed it, as the footage had been left with a film development company and never collected. When the company, Palmer Films, went out of business in the mid-1990s, a cache of its films were acquired by archivist Rick Prelinger, whose large collection was in turn acquired by the Library of Congress who have been working to edit and publish the footage ever since. The Rolling Stones’ headline performance is filmed from the side of the stage, with closeup shots of a smiling, clapping Mick Jagger – as well as more tense and frenetic scenes, as burly Hells Angels flank the stage. The motorcycle gang had been hired to provide security, but had attacked both performers and attenders during the day. During the Stones’ set, one festival-goer, Meredith Hunter, attempted to get on stage along with a number of other fans. Separate film footage showed that Hunter was carrying a gun, and he was stabbed and killed by Hells Angel member Alan Passaro. Mike Mashon of the Library of Congress states that the footage “doesn’t add anything to our understanding” of the killing. Hunter’s death, and the reportedly bleak mood of the event more generally, has become symbolic for the corruption of 1960s hippy idealism. The festival was separately chronicled by directors Albert and David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin for the film Gimme Shelter. As well as giving a sense of the huge scale, and some choice dance moves and fashion of the era, the lost footage is an opportunity to see performances in more detail that were edited out of the Stones-focused Gimme Shelter. It features an energetic and clearly funky performance by Carlos Santana and his band, and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young are filmed in the golden light of sunset – they didn’t appear in Gimme Shelter at all, as they told the directors they weren’t happy with their performance. Grace Slick is filmed charismatically fronting Jefferson Airplane, and the film-maker captures scuffles with Hells Angels on stage, including one audience member being pushed off and threatened; singer Marty Balin was infamously knocked unconscious by one of the bikers during the performance. Mashon writes of a barechested and magnificently hirsute Gram Parsons: “It was especially great to see Gram Parsons fronting the Flying Burrito Brothers, since you only see the back of his head in Gimme Shelter. Even better, there are good shots of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards off-stage watching him perform.” Mashon told the Washington Post regarding the unknown film-maker: “If an owner emerges, certainly we’d be interested in hearing that. Somebody with proof. But as far as we know this film was abandoned.”",Arts/Music,Lost footage of Rolling Stones at notorious Altamont festival uncovered,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/10/lost-footage-of-rolling-stones-at-notorious-altamont-festival-uncovered
1/10/2022,"Good morning. World No 1 tennis star Novak Djokovic will be immediately released from immigration detention in Australia, after the federal circuit court quashed a decision to cancel his visa.  Alex Hawke, the Australian immigration minister, has said he is considering whether to use his power to cancel Djokovic’s visa. The decision now under consideration to would result in Djokovic being excluded from Australia for three years – significantly upping the stakes in a bizarre border row that threatens his quest to win the most grand slam singles titles of all time. Can Australia’s immigration minister really cancel his visa? Immigration law professor Mary Crock told Guardian Australia the Migration Act gave the minister “godlike powers” to cancel visas and if “they really decide to … the power is there”. But what about the judge’s decision? That doesn’t matter as Crock explains: “Everything that has gone before can be disregarded – it is set up precisely for this situation, to come in and cancel a visa anyway.” Nineteen people including nine children were killed in an apartment fire in the Bronx in New York yesterday, one of the worst fire disasters in the city in 30 years. Thirteen people remained hospitalised in critical condition, authorities said late on Sunday afternoon. In all, more than five dozen were hurt. Eric Adams, the mayor who is in his first days in the job, said: “The numbers are horrific. This is a horrific, painful moment for the city of New York. The impact of this fire is going to really bring a level of pain and despair in our city. “This is going to be one of the worst fires that we have witnessed during modern times.” More than 200 firefighters fought the blaze, at a 120-unit, 19-storey building on East 181st Street known as Twin Parks. What caused the fire? Authorities said the fire was caused by a space heater in a duplex apartment. The fire commissioner, Dan Nigro, said the fire started shortly before 11am in a duplex on the second and third floors and spewed smoke through the building because a door was left open. Donald Trump cannot hide behind immunity from criminal prosecution and faces the possibility of being debarred from running for public office over his role in the Capitol attack, several members of Congress said yesterday. Days after the anniversary of the 6 January insurrection that left five people dead and scores injured after Trump supporters attempted to scupper the certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, the threat of possible criminal proceedings looms large over the former president. Lawmakers from both main parties, including moderate Republicans, said yesterday that Trump would not be spared criminal liability should evidence emerge that he actively coordinated the attack. Republican senator Mike Rounds from South Dakota spoke on the topic. What did he say? He told ABC’s This Week that any immunity from prosecution that Trump enjoyed while in the White House evaporated on 20 January 2021, when he left office, saying the “shield of the presidency does not exist for someone who was a former president”. The Power of the Dog and Succession were the big winners at an unusual, stripped-back Golden Globes. Traditionally, the ceremony is a glitzy telecast with A-listers in attendance but after a year of controversies surrounding diversity and amoral practices, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association lost its footing in the industry, with publicity firms, studios and celebrities choosing to distance themselves. Nevertheless, the awards were still handed out. The acclaimed Netflix drama The Power of the Dog was named best motion picture – drama, while Jane Campion became the third woman to win best director. Kodi Smit-McPhee won best supporting actor for his performance in the film. On the television side, HBO’s hit drama Succession picked up awards for best drama, best actor for Jeremy Strong and best supporting actress for Sarah Snook. Who attended the ceremony? Sunday night’s event took place at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Los Angeles, with no stars or audience, and just select members and grantees. Results were announced via social media. Bob Saget, the actor and comedian most famous for his role in the much-loved 80s sitcom Full House, has died at the age of 65. He had been found unresponsive in his hotel room at the Ritz-Carlton in Orlando, Florida yesterday. Aung San Suu Kyi has been handed a four-year jail sentence by a military court in Myanmar over various offences, including illegal possession of walkie-talkies, the latest judgment in a series of cases that could lead to her spending the rest of her life in detention. The Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has tested positive for Covid-19. In a statement on Sunday evening, the office of the New York progressive said she was “experiencing symptoms and recovering at home”. Lithuania has paid more than $110,000 to Abu Zubaydah, the Guantánamo detainee known as the “forever prisoner”, in compensation for having allowed the CIA to hold him at a secret site outside Vilnius where he was subjected to forms of torture. Senator Bernie Sanders has called on Democrats to make “a major course correction” that focuses on fighting for America’s working class and standing up to powerful corporate interests because the Democrats’ legislative agenda is stalled and their party faces tough prospects in this November’s elections. In an exclusive interview, the senator says it’s time to “step up and take on the greed of the ruling class in America”. Planet-heating emissions roared back in the United States in 2021, dashing hopes that the pandemic would prove a watershed moment in greening American society to address the climate crisis, new figures have shown. The onset of the pandemic in 2020 led to a sharp drop in greenhouse gas emissions, spurring predictions that a newly shaped American economy would emerge to help banish the era of fossil fuels. These forecasts may well have been baseless, however, with the new research showing that US emissions rose by 6.2% last year, compared with 2020. An infant boy handed in desperation to a US soldier across an airport wall in the chaos of the American evacuation of Afghanistan has been found and reunited with his relatives. The baby, Sohail Ahmadi, was just two months old when he went missing on 19 August as thousands of people rushed to leave Afghanistan as it fell to the Taliban. After a Reuters story published in November with his pictures, the baby was located in Kabul, where a 29-year-old taxi driver named Hamid Safi had found him in the airport and taken him home to raise as his own.

1/10/2022,"So the much-disgraced Golden Globes, derided for a lack of diversity and transparency in the voting membership, lucrative TV coverage cancelled, gravy-train derailed and the awards ceremony dwindled to a virtual event on social media, carries paradoxically on with delivering a set of awards that are in perfectly plausible good taste and not very much different from all the other un-disgraced awards ceremonies. However, it was sad to see Paul Thomas Anderson’s dazzling comedy of transgression Licorice Pizza overlooked, of which more in a moment. Jane Campion’s handsome, complex and brilliant western drama The Power of the Dog gets best picture (drama) and best director, along with best supporting actor for the excellent Kodi Smit-McPhee, while Steven Spielberg’s glorious, passionately respectful revival of West Side Story wins best picture in the musical or comedy section, along with its breakout player Ariana DeBose for best supporting actress and newcomer Rachel Zegler for best actress in musical/comedy.  Will Smith and Andrew Garfield win best actor in drama and musical/comedy respectively for King Richard – the story of Venus and Serena Williams’s demanding tennis-coach-dad Richard – and for tick, tick … BOOM!, about the troubled composer Jonathan Larson in which role the eminently lovable Garfield gave an object acting lesson in relatability and emotional availability. Entirely decent choices, though I was sorry here to see Mahershala Ali overlooked for his excellent performance in Swan Song, and indeed Denzel Washington’s mighty interpretation of Shakespeare’s Macbeth. And the Globes’ excellent best foreign language list would surely pass muster in the most demanding critics’ choice forum with Ryûsuke Hamaguchi’s Drive My Car emerging as the winner. The Power of the Dog, through that mysterious process of awards-season groupthink, is emerging as the single frontrunner, though there could hardly be a more deserving beneficiary: a colossal tragic drama taking place on a giant plain, dominated by an almost dreamlike house, surreally isolated on this vast landscape. Benedict Cumberbatch gives a fascinatingly spiky, confrontational, uningratiating performance as the cattleman in the grip of psychological turbulence he cannot explain and of which he is perhaps hardly even aware, as he begins a spiteful duel with his sister-in-law (fellow nominee Kirsten Dunst) and her son played by Smit-McPhee. West Side Story, though a box office disappointment, and coolly received by some critics for its alleged failure to be radically different from the original stage show and 1961 movie version, seemed to me a dazzling spectacle, whose every scene and dance sequence is presented with matchless flair and exuberance. This is a magnificent picture that really should be seen on the big screen – and let’s hope its Globes success will boost the box office. I loved Kenneth Branagh’s heartfelt autobiographical movie Belfast, about his early childhood in Northern Ireland at the beginning of the Troubles, for its heart-on-sleeve directness and the way he challenged the tacit liberal consensus that Belfast and the Troubles can only be represented in terms of angry despair. It was great to see Branagh pick up best screenplay – but I have to say that here, as in so many other categories, the superb Licorice Pizza (the 70s-set story of a hilariously pushy 15-year-old boy and his romantic obsession with a 25-year-old woman) was snubbed, and its superb female lead Alana Haim was not even nominated. Perhaps this is a film that confuses too many people, and its jagged, surreally satirical barbs at racism and antisemitism not easily accommodated into the contemporary discourse. And as for Nicole Kidman winning best actress (drama) for her very peculiar impersonation of Lucille Ball in Aaron Sorkin’s strenuous Being the Ricardos, about the 50s TV hit I Love Lucy … well, big fan of Kidman as I am, this was not her greatest performance and she was arguably the weakest link in a category that included Kristen Stewart’s performance as Diana, Lady Gaga’s uproarious turn in House of Gucci and Jessica Chastain in The Eyes of Tammy Faye. The Globe should really have gone to Olivia Colman for her amazingly good and richly detailed performance in Maggie Gyllenhaal’s The Lost Daughter. So – no backslapping, no boozy dinner, no outrageous presenter gags from Ricky Gervais, but a decent, if mainstream, list of winners.",Arts/Film,The Power of the Dog among worthy winners as disgraced Golden Globes plays it safe,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/10/the-power-of-the-dog-among-worthy-winners-as-disgraced-golden-globes-plays-it-safe
1/10/2022,"After years of driving past and reminding each other that “one day we should stop here for lunch”, we finally did. We turned off Via Ternana, a few hundred metres before Poggio Mirteto station in Lazio, and into a wide, informal car park where we immediately found a spot by the wall with sun and the words “Ecofattoria Sabine” painted on it. Words on green awnings promised local products, which in an area packed with olive trees and busy with sheep are welcome. Two women were setting tables outside, and the air carried the smell of just-lit charcoal. Someone must have done experiments looking at the endorphins released when people walk towards lunch; the reasons behind the euphoria felt on nearing the door of a restaurant, cafe or pub, and how it differs depending on whether it is somewhere familiar or new. Add hunger to the mix, as well as the sound of cutlery and the distant smell of sheep, meaning the promise of pecorino. And where there is pecorino, there is its soft, white byproduct, the result of reheating the leftover whey to make ricotta di pecora (sheep’s milk ricotta). There were more endorphins when we, inexperienced new dog owners, allowed our small creature too close to the handsome reigning dog. As it turned out, she wanted only to make it clear who was in charge before returning to her spot in the unflinching sun. I did, however, need a seat at one of the wooden tables and a glass of wine after that.  If someone has researched near-the-door endorphins, they must have looked at sitting-down-and-putting-knees-under-the-table endorphins, too. Also, what happens chemically when you first glance at a menu, take the first sip of wine and taste of bread, which surely triggers something calming. We ordered local salami, which came with just-baked buns the size of pin cushions and speckled with cheese. After that, fat potato gnocchi and tomato sauce for Luca and Vincenzo, fettuccine alla pecorara for me, then lamb cooked on the grill outside. But back to the pasta, a simple recipe of great goodness. “Alla pecorara” translates as “shepherd’s style”. It is a dish most famous maybe in the neighbouring region of Abruzzo, and most notably in the province of Pescara, where it means pasta – often homemade rings called anelli – with tomatoes, other vegetables and sheep’s milk ricotta. However, in Lazio and especially Sabina, pasta alla pecorara means ricotta, pecorino and guanciale – and, at Ecofattoria Sabine, hand-rolled fat ropes of pici or ribbons of fettuccine. What is interesting about their version is that they use a meat slicer to cut the guanciale, which means it is incredibly thin and so fries into almost-crisps that shatter. Wonderful, but at home I prefer fatter batons. Serves 4 200g guanciale, or pancetta or bacon300g ricotta – sheep’s or cows’ milk40g pecorino romanoBlack pepper400g pasta (mezze maniche, penne, pici, fettuccine) Put a pan of water on for the pasta. Cut the guanciale into short batons, put into a pan over a medium-low heat and fry gently until light golden and some fat has rendered out. (If you are using pancetta or bacon, fry it in a little olive oil.) Lift out the guanciale and set aside, then pour off the fat and keep that, too. Once the water is boiling, add salt, stir, then add the pasta and set the timer. In a large, warm bowl, mash the ricotta with the pecorino, lots of black pepper and two tablespoons of the guanciale fat. Stir, taste to see if it needs salt, then lift the cooked pasta directly into the ricotta and toss, cautiously adding a little of the pasta cooking water if you think it needs loosening. Divide between bowls, top each serving with some of the crisp guanciale and serve with red wine and bread for calmly cleaning the bowls.

1/10/2022,"Ayear ago last Thursday, Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy were fleeing for their lives as a violent mob swarmed the halls of the US Capitol. With their personal safety at risk, the two most powerful Republicans on Capitol Hill at last stood up to Donald Trump. In a heated phone call, McCarthy, the House minority leader, fruitlessly implored the president to call off the mob. Senate majority leader McConnell later called the rioters “terrorists” and said Trump was “morally responsible” for the violence.  But McConnell and McCarthy soon slunk back to enabling Trump’s assaults on democracy. They were quiet while Trump insisted the 2020 election was stolen and that anyone who disagreed must be purged from public office. They stayed mute as Trump supporters threatened violence against election officials and Republican-dominated state legislatures rewrote laws and procedures to prevent fair voting. McConnell and McCarthy have shamelessly put party ahead of country and ambition ahead of duty, setting up alarming ramifications for the future. Scientists have said for years that humanity faces a climate emergency and only rapid, far-reaching action can preserve a livable planet. On the first anniversary of the 6 January attack, it’s clear the United States also faces a democracy emergency as well. Only rapid, far-reaching action can preserve a government that is of, by, and for the people. The democracy emergency is closely linked to the climate crisis. Each is grounded in a big lie – that climate science is a hoax, that Trump won in 2020 – pushed by the same rightwing politicians and propaganda “news” outlets and embraced with cult-like devotion by Trump’s followers. Left untreated, each threatens disaster. If Trump’s forces do change enough electoral rules and personnel to guarantee victory in 2022 and beyond, there is zero chance the US government will take the strong climate action needed to avert global catastrophe. Defusing the global climate emergency therefore depends on protecting democracy. To be sure, the US is not the only country where anti-democratic trends hamper climate progress. Most of the worst laggards at November’s Cop26 climate summit were countries where authoritarianism is either entrenched or on the rise: China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, India, the US. But the collapse of US democracy would carry especially damaging climate consequences. Slashing global emissions in half by 2030, as science says is imperative, would be impossible if the world’s biggest economy and leading historical carbon emitter refuses to help. How to defuse the democracy emergency is too big a question to answer briefly. President Biden and the Democrats surely must do more; the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has promised a vote by 17 January on reforming the filibuster to pass fair voting laws. A mobilized civil society is also vital. With Trump’s followers trying to install partisans on voting boards across the land, the Atlantic’s Barton Gellman notes that democracy activists can likewise work at the local and state levels to block such skulduggery and ensure fair elections. A free press is foundational to democracy, and journalism must also rise to the occasion with outspoken coverage. Monika Bauerlein, chief executive of Mother Jones, urges the media to treat “the war on democracy” as the “big story” of 2022. The Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin says political reporters should “stop … concealing that only one party is launching a campaign to suppress votes” and “demand that Republican [officials] defend their participation in the big lie of a stolen election” – and if Republicans try to dodge, keep asking the question. Aside from Trump himself, no one deserves such journalistic grilling more than McConnell and McCarthy. As the senior Republicans in Congress, they have the stature to oppose Trump’s campaign for one-party rule. Twin profiles in cowardice, they have instead betrayed their oath to defend the constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. McConnell and McCarthy want the world to forget that a year ago today Trump’s mob was hunting them down, leading each man to stand up, briefly, for democracy. But the world must not forget. The press in particular must not allow McConnell, McCarthy and most other Republicans to obscure that they are enabling the gravest threat to American democracy since the civil war – and, by so doing, encouraging a hellish climate future.

1/10/2022,"Planet-heating emissions roared back in the United States in 2021, dashing hopes that the pandemic would prove a watershed moment in greening American society to address the climate crisis, new figures have shown. Following the onset of the pandemic in 2020, millions of people switched to working from home, car and airplane travel plummeted and industrial output slowed. This led to a sharp drop in greenhouse gas emissions, spurring predictions that a newly shaped American economy would emerge to help banish the era of fossil fuels.  These forecasts may well have been baseless, however, with the new research showing that US emissions rose by 6.2% last year, compared to 2020. While emissions were still 5% down from 2019 levels, the jump in pollution as people returned to previous rhythms of life was greater than last year’s overall economic growth. “We expected a rebound but it’s dismaying that emissions came back even faster than the overall economy,” said Kate Larsen, a partner at Rhodium Group, the independent research firm that conducted the analysis. “We aren’t just reducing the carbon intensity of the economy, we are increasing it. We are doing exactly the opposite of what we need to be doing.” The leap in emissions in 2021 was largely down to an increase in cars and trucks on the road, with a 10% growth in transportation emissions from a year previously as Americans, and their goods, started moving again amid optimism spurred by the rollout of vaccines. Coal, the dirtiest of fossil fuels that has been in a steady decline in the US, also made an unwelcome return, with its use in power generation posting a 17% increase on 2020. Emissions from industrial processes rose by 6.6% last year, while emissions from the use of buildings edged up slightly. US emissions have been on a gradual decline since around 2005, primarily because of market conditions that have made coal uncompetitive and gas, a less polluting fossil fuel, attractive to utilities as a cheap and abundant alternative. Despite more than three decades of increasingly urgent warnings from climate scientists, and a growing parade of catastrophic wildfires, floods and heatwaves, the US has never put in place any national legislation to deal with the climate crisis. Larsen said it is “critically important” for Congress to pass climate measures in the Build Back Better spending bill that has been stalled by Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat from West Virginia who has deep ties to the coal industry. “There was hope this pandemic would bring about wholesale changes, but we aren’t seeing that across the board,” said Larsen. “More importantly, we need to decarbonize our economy and not just bet on individual behaviour changing. “It’s concerning that we rely upon the oil and gas market to lower emissions and even more concerning we have not passed the rules and laws we need. It was always going to be an uphill battle for the US and now that hill is even steeper.” The uptick in emissions in 2021 has thrown the US off track in the rate of cuts required to meet the internationally agreed targets articulated in the Paris climate accords. The deal states that countries must try to keep the global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, a point beyond which scientists warn the world will face dire impacts. “We’ve got to come down from the peak, in fact halfway down to zero, within this decade if we are to remain on course to keep warming below a catastrophic 1.5C,” said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University. “There was progress at Cop26 but there needs to be much more. And for the US to be able to do its part, we need the climate provisions of Build Back Better to pass Congress as soon as possible.”",News/Environment,"US emissions roared back last year after pandemic drop, figures show",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/10/us-emissions-climate-crisis-global-heating
1/10/2022,"The Rev Al Sharpton will deliver a eulogy on Monday for Valentina Orellana-Peralta, the 14-year-old girl killed by a Los Angeles police officer in a shooting at a clothing store last month.  The funeral service for Orellana-Peralta will begin at 11am at the City of Refuge church in Gardena, south of LA. The family’s attorney, Benjamin Crump, who represented the family of George Floyd, is also expected to speak. Valentina was shopping for a Christmas dress with her mother on 23 December at a Burlington Coat Factory in North Hollywood when the LAPD officer William Dorsey Jones Jr fired three rounds at a 24-year-old man in the store, killing him and Valentina in the process. Valentina was in a nearby dressing room with her mother, Soledad Peralta and died in her mother’s arms. “There was nothing I could do. As I lay screaming for help, the police did not come to help me or my daughter,” she said, days after the killing. Footage of the events at the store showed that the 24-year-old, Daniel Elena Lopez, had assaulted several customers with a bike lock. Jones’s body-camera footage revealed that the officer shot Elena Lopez from a distance, appearing to immediately fire three rounds before issuing any commands. Elena Lopez was standing alone at the other end of a store aisle, had no gun and appeared to be turning away from the officer the moment he was shot. He and Valentina both died on the scene. Valentina moved to the US from her native Chile six months ago, and her parents said she was excelling at her school, High Tech Los Angeles in Van Nuys, despite English being her second language. She had ambitions for a career in engineering and technology and was interested in building robots. Her parents said her primary dream was to become a US citizen. “It is like my whole heart has been ripped out of my body,” Juan Pablo Orellana Larenas, Valentina’s father, told reporters. He arrived from Chile days after his daughter was killed, and at a news conference held in his hand a skateboard, still in its plastic wrapping, that had arrived for Valentina on Christmas Eve, the day after she died. He said he would deliver the skateboard to her grave and lamented that the two of them would never get to see LeBron James play basketball in person. “She wanted to be here in the United States because this is the land of opportunity.” The Chilean president, Gabriel Boric, has called for justice for Valentina’s family, and Joe Biden has offered condolences. The killing of a young bystander has prompted widespread scrutiny of the LAPD, which shot a total of six people in a nine-day period last month, contributing to a sharp increase in officer shootings and killings in 2021. LA’s mayor, Eric Garcetti, has said the LAPD will review its tactics, training and policies in the wake of the killing. But the case has renewed calls for the defunding of the department, with critics arguing that ongoing reform efforts have failed to prevent police violence, and that officers must face accountability for misconduct and unjust killings.",News/US news,Reverend Al Sharpton to deliver eulogy at funeral of teenage girl shot by LAPD,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/10/reverend-al-sharpton-eulogy-funeral-valentina-orellana-peralta-shot-lapd
1/10/2022,"For students across the US, the return from winter break has been marked by chaos and confusion as the Omicron variant has exacerbated staff shortages and sparked fierce debates about how to reopen classrooms safely. In Chicago, classes resumed and then were canceled abruptly last week as the teachers’ union and school district failed to agree on safety protocols, while teachers in San Francisco and other Bay Area schools staged a “sickout” to demand more N95 face masks, testing and paid sick leave for those who contract the coronavirus.  For Los Angeles Unified – the second largest public school system in the US – classes are scheduled to resume on Tuesday, and educators, students, and parents alike are bracing for another winter of anxious uncertainty. Schools here are grappling with coronavirus conundrums that institutions across the country are facing – but on a huge scale. Vaccination rates continue to lag among children, and tests are in short supply. And all this comes as rates of Covid surge in the surrounding community, with about one in every five coronavirus tests in Los Angeles coming back positive. In a district where many students come from low-income families and more than 80% of students qualify for a free lunch under federal guidelines, “there are no real easy answers right now” on how to balance children’s educational needs and health, said Tyrone Howard, a professor of education at the University of California, Los Angeles. With coronavirus transmission rates in LA exceeding levels seen during the winter of 2020-21, Los Angeles Unified announced last week that all students and staff returning to campus this week must show a negative Covid-19 test. New rules from LA county also require employees at public and private schools to wear medical-grade masks on campus, including outdoors in crowded spaces. Administrators and health officials expect that the Omicron variant is likely to send exposed children and teachers back home and into quarantine. But after becoming one of the first large districts in the US to adopt a strict vaccine mandate for students 12 and older for this coming semester, school officials decided to delay enforcement until next fall – largely because tens of thousands of students remain unvaccinated. Marisol Rosales, a mother of four school-aged children in Los Angeles, said she has had trouble keeping up with the shifting rules and requirements for each of her kids’ campuses. “I’ve been calling all day to find out more about the guidelines, and where I need to get my kids tested, and by which day,” she said. She and her husband are also mentally preparing to take time off work or find last-minute childcare if schools shut down again, which will mean navigating the logistics of finding space for their four kids to attend online classes from their tight, one-bedroom home. “There’s just a lot to worry about right now,” she said. While Los Angeles Unified is reopening this week, other school systems in the LA area opened during the first week of January, many with teachers and staff missing. The Santa Ana Unified school district in southern California was missing about 10% of its teachers, with 324 employees either sick or in quarantine. Another local district, in San Gabriel, closed a middle school and a high school following outbreaks but opted to keep other campuses open. LA Unified is bracing for similar issues, while also seeking to fill 600 teacher vacancies after the district saw a spate of resignations and retirements during the pandemic. “Teaching is already a stressful job. Doing so when I’m fearing for my life and for students’ lives and the lives of their families is just on a different level,” said Joanne Yi, an ethnic studies and geography teacher at Augustus Hawkins in South Los Angeles. Yi said she was dreading returning to class and fretting about whether she might contract a breakthrough infection, despite being vaccinated, or worse – pass on the infection to a student. Her classes largely consist of low-income students of color, many of whom are recent immigrants, and many of whom are undocumented. Their parents often work in healthcare, food service or other industries – where they may face high risks of contracting Covid-19. And many students live in multigenerational homes with parents and grandparents and may lack access to affordable healthcare. “The classroom can easily become ground zero for a mass infection in the community,” Yi said. She and other local teachers said they would feel safer if the state or local government developed benchmarks or guidelines to indicate when schools should close – similar to the color-coded system that California instituted last year. “Right now we’re consistent in our lack of consistency,” she said. The inconsistency can wear on students, as well. “I think the number one emotion I feel is just frustrated,” said Favour Akingbemi, 17, a senior at Washington Preparatory high school in South LA. Facing yet another semester of unpredictability and the prospect of trying to focus on online classes alongside three of her siblings at home, Akingbemi said she felt burned out. Nearly three of Akingbemi’s four high school years have been defined by the pandemic. Over the past year, she has had to convince her own parents, as well as a number of classmates, to get vaccinated, refuting the misinformation they are bombarded with on WhatsApp and social media. “It’s upsetting that we’re still stuck in this pandemic,” she said. While about 86% of LA Unified students 12 and older have been vaccinated, vaccine rates are lagging among students five to 11 years old, who became eligible for Covid-19 vaccines in the fall. Across Los Angeles county, only 15.7% of children aged five to 11 are fully vaccinated. For Rosales, concerns that Covid-19 vaccines will cause long-term side-effects in her kids have outweighed worries that they could contract coronavirus at school. Both Rosales and her husband are fully vaccinated and boosted, “but I don’t think the vaccines should be mandated for little kids”, she said. “I worry about the repercussions of the vaccines on their developing bodies.” No serious safety concerns or lasting side-effects from Covid-19 vaccines were found in clinical trials among children, and public health officials and pediatricians have been assuring parents that the approved coronavirus vaccines – much like other vaccines required for children – are safe. “I tell parents, though, it’s OK to be overwhelmed, it’s OK to have fears,” said Ilan Shapiro, the medical director of health education and wellness at AltaMed in LA, who has been conducting bilingual outreach efforts to promote the vaccine. “I try to explain to parents how I decided to get my own young kids vaccinated.” Debates over mandating vaccines for LA Unified centered on whether it would be feasible for schools to send up to 30,000 unvaccinated students aged 12 and over back to distance learning. Officials in Portland, New York and Chicago also paused discussions of mandates this winter. With vaccination rates among Black and Latino residents lagging, a strict mandate threatens to push already vulnerable students of color into a “separate and unequal” remote schooling system, said Howard. But public health experts say that boosting vaccine rates among children is the only surefire way to protect children and keep schools open as more infectious variants arise. That is especially true for Black and Latino students in Los Angeles, whose families have been disproportionately affected by Covid-19, said Yvonne Maldonado, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Stanford. The county revealed last fall that unvaccinated Black and Latino residents had the highest Covid-19 rates during the last wave of infections, driven by the Delta variant. Although children are less likely than adults to fall seriously ill from Covid-19, amid this surge of cases, Covid-19 hospitalization rates among children are rising. Across the US, an average of 824 children are hospitalized each day with Covid-19. “If we really want to protect these kids, we have to get them vaccinated,” Maldonado said. State and local governments need to do more to reach out to parents, she added, and provide more information, in more languages, about the safety of the available Covid-19 vaccines. “Everybody’s burned out and tired and overwhelmed,” she said. “But I think we need to do this on behalf of kids.”",News/US news,"Staff shortages, fear and confusion: Los Angeles schools grapple with Covid chaos",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/10/us-schools-covid-omicron-los-angeles-unified
1/10/2022,"When Lynda’s husband died in 2015, she had no idea that online support existed. Two years later she stumbled upon a Facebook group for widows and started connecting with others in her situation. “You can’t really know what it’s like until you’ve been through it,” says Lynda. “It was nice to meet a group of people who understood.” In September 2018, she began speaking to Carl, who’d been widowed earlier that year. “After my wife, Pam, died, I didn’t see anyone for days,” he says. “I hadn’t really used Facebook before but I hoped joining a group for widows might be a way to meet people.” Both he and Lynda had each been married for more than 40 years. “I clocked her on the group and read some of her messages,” remembers Carl. “I thought she was very positive and spoke about things she enjoyed in life, as well as her husband.”  When he was invited on a group holiday that autumn, he turned to the support group for advice. “He asked whether Pam would approve and I said she’d tell him to go but not to drink too much,” laughs Lynda. “He wrote back to ask if I’d known her, as that’s exactly what she would have said.” They began sending each other private messages and built a friendship. A couple of weeks later, they arranged to meet in a pub in Manchester and got on brilliantly. “My husband was the first boy I’d ever been out with. We got together when I was 14,” says Lynda. “Although Carl and I had fun, it scared me a bit. It didn’t seem right to be so attracted to another man when I still felt married.” She wrote Carl a message to say that she couldn’t take the relationship any further. “I’d not been dumped since I was 17 and then I got dumped on the first date,” laughs Carl. But he wasn’t ready to give up. “I knew she felt confused but I didn’t want to lose the connection we had.” After more conversations online, Lynda decided to see him again. “I said yes because we got on so well. He made me laugh by telling me stories about when he was a footballer, many years ago.” After that, they went on regular dates to the pub or the cinema. “I lived in Manchester and Carl lived in Wigan. A few days before we met, [the mayor of Greater Manchester] Andy Burnham gave women my age a free bus pass, so it cost me nothing to travel to him a few times a week,” says Lynda. “It was as if it were meant to be.” They married in January 2020, just before the pandemic hit, and she moved into Carl’s home. “Because we’d both been widowed, we experienced opposition from family about our relationship at first,” says Carl. “In widow [support] groups, people say it’s very common. But our families came around and now everyone is happy for us.” Their late partners are still an important part of their lives. “You never forget,” says Lynda. “We talk about them and tell little stories about what they were like. It’s a form of therapy.” Recently, Carl was diagnosed with a rare, progressive, muscle-wasting condition called inclusion body myositis, but they won’t let it stop them from making the most of their time together. “We’ve already been through the worst by losing a partner. Disability is just another journey; we’ll work it out,” says Carl. “We’ve got a different way of looking at life. We are learning to adapt but we are in it together.” Lynda loves Carl’s positivity. “He’s got such a great sense of humour and a lovely voice,” she says. “I liked his Wigan accent the first time I heard it. We have our breakfast in bed every day and chat together all the time.” Carl appreciates his partner’s kindness. “I’ve never known anyone as generous as Lynda. I’m just so glad we found each other.” Want to share your story? Tell us a little about yourself, your partner and how you got together by filling in the form here.

1/10/2022,"Vladimir Putin has claimed the unrest in Kazakhstan last week that killed at least 164 people was the result of foreign meddling, and said a Russian-led military bloc should take steps to ensure future attempts to interfere in the region failed. “The events in Kazakhstan are not the first and far from the last attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of our states from the outside,” said the Russian president, who was speaking at a video conference of leaders of the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), a military alliance that deployed around 2,500 troops to Kazakhstan this week at the request of Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.  The CSTO, which also includes Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Tajikistan, has never before deployed troops, and many in Kazakhstan expressed extreme unease at having Russian troops on the ground. “The measures taken by the CSTO made it clear that we would not let anyone destabilise the situation at our home and implement so-called colour revolution scenarios,” said Putin. The Russian president believes former Soviet nations should fall into Moscow’s sphere of influence, and has frequently dismissed popular uprisings as “coloured revolutions” organised and financed from abroad. Putin also said the events in Kazakhstan showed the dangers of social media and unrestricted internet use. Putin’s words come as negotiations in Geneva begin between US and Russian delegations, after Russia demanded a new security deal with Washington and amid fears that Putin is poised to order a further incursion into Ukraine. The fast-moving events in Kazakhstan took the Kremlin and other regional players by surprise. Protests began over a sharp rise in fuel prices, and quickly spread across the country, but they were taken over by violent groups who stormed government buildings and the airport in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s biggest city. Widespread looting followed. At the CSTO meeting, Tokayev described the protests against him as a coup, launched by unspecified internal and external forces. “Under the guise of spontaneous protests, a wave of unrest broke out... It became clear that the main goal was to undermine the constitutional order and to seize power. We are talking about an attempted coup d’état,” he said. He also claimed trained Islamist fighters were involved in the unrest. Tokayev has repeatedly described violent protesters as “bandits and terrorists” and said on Friday he had given an order to security forces to shoot to kill without warning. Although the country is getting back to normal, Tokayev said the hunt for so-called “terrorists” was continuing. On Sunday, Kazakhstani authorities said 164 people had died in the violence, including three children. The interior ministry announced on Monday that security forces had detained nearly 8,000 people, a number that is rising sharply each day. It is not clear how many of them will be charged. Concerns about how transparent the investigation process would be arose when state television aired footage of a bruised man who said he had been paid to travel from neighbouring Kyrgyzstan and take part in violence. Viewers in Kyrgyzstan quickly identified him as Vikram Ruzakhunov, a well-known jazz musician who frequently toured Kazakhstan. After sustained protest, Ruzakhunov was reportedly released on Monday. Last week, the powerful head of security services, Karim Masimov, was relieved of his duties and then arrested on suspicion of treason. While there has so far been no evidence presented about foreign backing for the unrest, many have speculated that the protest movement was used by groups inside the Kazakh elite to settle differences. Some sources have pointed to recent disagreements between Tokayev and figures close to his predecessor, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who ruled the country from independence in 1991 until 2019 and handpicked Tokayev as his successor. Nazarbayev holds the honorific title of leader of the nation, and the country’s capital was renamed Nur-Sultan in his honour in 2019. He was removed by Tokayev as head of the national security council this week, and has still not spoken or appeared in public.",News/World news,"Foreign meddling behind Kazakhstan unrest, Putin claims",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/foreign-meddling-behind-kazakhstan-unrest-putin-claims

Wordle 200 4/6⬜🟨⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜🟨⬜🟩🟨🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩 I have been trying largely to avoid social media; when I first saw posts headed “Wordle”, I eyed the intriguing collections of coloured blocks devoid of context and wondered: what’s the con? Is this trying to harvest my data, my eyeballs or my wordplay techniques? What are the steps between this intriguing game and my imminent existence in a mine, pecking seed to obtain fresh multiverse rewards? It was humbling, then, to hear the creator of Wordle talking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme (1:24:38): At the beginning of last year, my partner and I, we got really into doing crosswords and playing word games and I wanted to make a game for us to play each day in the morning as part of our routine. So, the Wordle creator is … utterly one of us? And he has found a way to make other solvers’ experiences intriguing before you play and fascinating afterwards? Unless that claim is part of the con, here it is. Perhaps now is a good moment to mark the retiring of the word “program”. Once upon a time, some programs were apps. A little later, Apple was so keen on us all making a connection between “app” and “Apple” that it sued Amazon for using the name “Appstore”.

1/10/2022,"Boris Johnson is facing increasing pressure from his own MPs, and from usually supportive newspapers, to take action over the cost of living crisis at the start of what could be another perilous week for the prime minister. In a pair of front pages that will spook No 10, the Daily Mail and Daily Express led on Monday with calls from senior Conservatives for measures including an end to VAT being imposed on heating bills.  Also on Monday, one of the party’s perceived rising stars, the Tees Valley mayor, Ben Houchen, used an article in another Tory-friendly paper, the Times, to warn that voters in “red wall” seats would need tangible evidence of levelling up soon. It follows similar noises from usually supportive media over the weekend – and new polling of Tory members by Sky which showed nearly half believe Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, would win more seats for the Tories at the next election than Johnson. Perhaps the most alarming front page for Johnson will be Monday’s Mail, which quoted three Conservative MPs who chair select committees all saying the cost of living is – as described by Robert Halfon, who chairs the education committee – the “number one issue facing the prime minister”. Julian Knight, who heads the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, told the paper: “Boris needs to wake up and listen to his party on energy and set a clear path out of the cost of living crisis. In the short term, he needs to abolish the VAT on energy bills and get rid of the green taxes.” The Express similarly had a front page saying: “PM urged: act now on cost of living squeeze”, quoting former ministers including Esther McVey. Over the weekend, the Saturday edition of the Sun also called in an editorial for an end to VAT on energy, “urgent relief for the crippling price rises we now face”, and an delay or cancellation of the rise in national insurance contributions intended to help the NHS and social care. Ministers have been resistant to the idea of cutting VAT on energy, as it would cut bills for everyone, including those who are not facing difficulties. Asked about the idea by Sky News on Monday, Michael Gove, the communities and levelling-up secretary, said it would be better to “take a balanced approach and a balanced approach means that when we can support, we provide support most for those in the most difficult circumstances”. But alongside the pressure for Johnson to cut taxes, other influential voices are also calling for more investment in levelling up. In his article for the Times, Houchen said that before the next election, voters “need to see with their eyes concrete evidence that they were right to back this government”. He wrote: “Voters are also realists – they know that levelling up is not something that will be delivered in just a year or two, it will be a decades long project. But they do need to see progress, and this means steel going up to deliver new factories, spades in the ground for new energy infrastructure, and cranes in action as new bridges are built out over waters.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson under growing pressure over cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/10/boris-johnson-under-growing-pressure-over-cost-of-living-crisis

1/10/2022,"Jubilant Serbian Australians have taken their celebrations away from the detention hotel their beloved Novak Djokovic had been held in for days, leaving behind deflated refugees and their supporters on Monday. Since December 2020 refugee advocates have stood outside the former hotel every day, trying desperately to bring awareness to the plight of the 30-plus men stuck indefinitely inside.  When the world’s No 1 male tennis player unexpectedly joined refugees and asylum seekers inside, it brought a new group of protesters and an international media spotlight. But that unlikely alliance ended on Monday night, as a court ordered Djokovic’s release from immigration detention after quashing the Australian government’s decision to cancel his visa. To his fans, their hero had won a David and Goliath battle for freedom. They were there to party. They carried Serbian flags, cheering “Novak! Novak! Novak!” before heading down to Federation Square to continue the celebrations. Across the park, the mood was more sombre, as advocates for the refugees gathered together. Occasionally they would chant “free them all” but mostly they stood in a solemn silence. They’ve spent the last five days trying to springboard off the media attention on Djokovic to raise awareness about the other men stuck inside. They’ve climbed on the building, used chalk spray to make huge signs and arranged media interviews with refugees. Some have even been arrested – and now as Djokovic walks free they fear the men will be forgotten. Gemma Harben had been protesting at the centre since long before the tennis star arrived – she said the attention had made the refugees feel hopeful. “They’ve felt forgotten and ignored for so long and finally people turn up, it might not be for them, but people are outside the building,” Harben said. “They’re on the international news. To see this kind of attention disappear again will be heartbreaking.” For them, the decision to let Djokovic free showed what money and power can do – a win against Australia’s notoriously strict immigration laws. “I hope they reassess the rules and let everyone out.” Harben said she hoped the Djokovic saga would make people realise “they’re all human beings”. That the tennis champion could end up in a basic hotel next to men who have been locked up, some for nine years, showed we are not that different from each other, she said. At the small protest on Monday night, one refugee advocate interrupted some of the supporters’ celebrations to ask if they would all come back tomorrow for the refugees. “Yes,” they answered, but the advocate wasn’t convinced. Djokovic supporters argue he has been a pawn in Australia’s political game, used by the federal government to win votes. “There was no basis to hold him and they did it anyway,” Neb Jovanovic, who was draped in a Serbian flag, said. “We knew the government had their secret agenda behind it, but he has pulled through – that’s what he always does. “It’s a step in the right direction for freedom.” When asked if they will see the tennis star play at the Australian Open, there was a pause. As a matter of principle he should pull out they said. “If I was him I wouldn’t do it,” Jovanovic said. Watching on was Adnam, who did not give his last name. He has been in detention since he was 15. He is now 24. Describing the conditions in the hotel, he says he is never called by his name, only “detainee” or by his number. There is no fresh air in their room and he doesn’t often mingle with the others – everyone is often too depressed to leave their room, he said. “It’s terrifying and bizarre. You’re always treated as a suspect. You are treated worse than a criminal.” He said the crowds outside the window the last few days and the fact they were sharing a building with Djokovic had given them hope. “It does warm our hearts. It will help us fight through this unfair environment and give us the strength to fight back this cruel immigration system.” Djokovic’s detention brought two very different groups together with very different kinds of protesting. The tennis star’s supporters sang, danced, lit candles in the evening and joked with police. Refugee advocates used megaphones, drums and chants to get their point across. While each gathered outside the Park hotel for their own reasons, there were enough similarities to unite them, if only briefly. “I feel so ignorant,” one Djokovic supporter said as she was leaving on Thursday. “I came here for him and found out they’ve been locked up nine years. It’s so wrong.”",Sport/Sport,‘Heartbreaking’: refugees left behind while Novak Djokovic’s supporters celebrate court win,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/10/heartbreaking-refugees-left-behind-while-novak-djokovics-supporters-celebrate-court-win
