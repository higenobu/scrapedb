The price of Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose 3.5%, to about $99 a barrel on Tuesday and West Texas Intermediate was trading at nearly $95.50 a barrel, up about 5%.  The Biden administration has already warned that concerns over armed conflict in Ukraine will affect US consumers, who are already suffering from soaring inflation. Last week Joe Biden warned his decision to impose sanctions on Russia would have consequences. “I will not pretend this will be painless,” said Biden. Pres. Biden says Russian invasion of Ukraine could impact energy prices.“I will not pretend this will be painless…We’re preparing to deploy all the tools and authority at our disposal to provide relief at the gas pump.” https://t.co/D9IPWPkiUh pic.twitter.com/OzJrnsBQx4 His comments were echoed by vice-president Kamala Harris on Sunday during ​​ a diplomatic visit to the Munich Security Conference in Germany. “When America stands for principles, and all of the things that we hold dear, it requires sometimes for us to put ourselves out there in a way that maybe we will incur some cost. In this situation, that may relate to energy costs,” she said. Some areas of the US are already experiencing sharp rises in prices. Gas prices across California hit a record average high of $4.75 a gallon on Monday, well above the nationwide average of $3.53, which is up roughly a dollar from a year ago. While there are a number of factors at play in California’s rising fuel prices, including local taxes, geography and a shift in oil production, AAA spokesperson Doug Shupe told Los Angeles’ KTLA: “The number one reason why we’re seeing these pump prices is the geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine. That’s putting upward pressure on the crude oil price. Also, as many parts of the country start warming up, the demand for fuel is increasing as people start to head out and take those road trips.” ",News/Business,Oil prices climb to nearly $100 a barrel with rising tensions over Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/oil-prices-climb-rising-tensions-over-ukraine
2/23/2022,"Gary Brooker, the lead singer of the rock band Procol Harum, whose 1967 hit A Whiter Shade of Pale mesmerised baby boomer fans with its psychedelic melancholy, has died at the age of 76. The pianist, composer and lyricist as well as frontman for the band had been treated for cancer. He died peacefully at home at the weekend.  A statement on Procol Harum’s website described Brooker as “a brightly shining, irreplaceable light in the music industry”. It added: “Gary exhibited and developed a highly individual talent. His first single with Procol Harum, 1967’s A Whiter Shade of Pale, is widely regarded as definingthe ‘summer of love’, yet it could scarcely have been more different from the characteristic records of that era …. “Gary’s voice and piano were the single defining constant of Procol’s 50-year international concert career. Without any stage antics or other gimmicks he was invariably the most watchable musician in the show.” But, the band said, Brooker’s “charisma was by no means confined to the stage. He lit up any room he entered, and his kindness to a multilingual family of fans was legendary. He was notable for his individuality, integrity, and occasionally stubborn eccentricity. His mordant wit, and appetite for the ridiculous, made him a priceless raconteur … “He was above all a devoted and loyal husband to Franky, whom he met in 1965 and married in 1968.” A Whiter Shade of Pale, written with Keith Reid, reached the top of the UK charts two weeks after it was released at the start of the ”summer of love”, the hippy nirvana of sex, drugs and rock’n’roll that outraged and alarmed older generations. The single also dominated the European and US charts, selling more than 10m copies. It has been covered by other artists – including Annie Lennox and Billy Joel – more than 1,000 times. Its opening line, “We skipped the light fandango”, and other lyrics sparked debate among critics and fans over their meaning. Some believed it was the story of a doomed sexual encounter, others that it was an account of a hallucinogenic drugs trip. A few even believed it was a retelling of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales. In 2014, Brooker said some of the inspiration for his composition came from Johann Sebastian Bach. “If you trace the chordal element, it does a bar or two of Bach’s Air on a G String before it veers off. That spark was all it took. I wasn’t consciously combining rock with classical, it’s just that Bach’s music was in me,” he told Uncut magazine. According to Procol Harum’s statement, Brooker, who grew up in Southend, Essex, later ​​added angling, painting, inventing and owning a pub to his other interests.

2/23/2022,"A former Post Office worker has told the public inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal he tried to kill himself on three occasions after being wrongly imprisoned for stealing from his employer. Another, also giving evidence on Tuesday, called for his former bosses including Adam Crozier, now chair of BT, to attend the hearings and answer for their role in the scandal.  Parmod Kalia, a father of four who was jailed for six months in 2001 after the organisation’s flawed IT system incorrectly suggested a £27,000 shortfall at his Orpington post office, told the inquiry how his once tight-knit family had been torn apart in the two decades since. “It came as a bit of a shock when the prison wardens wanted my belt and my tie, that was a bit humiliating,” said the 63-year-old, who was taken to Surrey’s High Down, a prison designated with the UK’s second-highest security level, after being sentenced. “I was numb at the time. Walking through the front door, being asked to strip and given a uniform … I was locked up basically for 23 hours a day.” Kalia, who had his conviction quashed last year but has yet to receive an interim compensation payment from the Post Office, said he had “buried” the events as best he could until a BBC Panorama documentary about the hundreds of wrongfully prosecuted Post Office workers aired in 2015. “Since then I’m now in depression and I have anxiety issues,” he said. “In April last year I went to my GP and for the first time I told him I was suffering from depression and anxiety and had attempted suicide on three occasions in 2015.” Kalia and his wife had struggled until as late as 1am some nights trying to get the Horizon IT system to balance the takings, as his young daughter slept behind the shop counter, and was ultimately forced to ask his mother for most of her savings after a union representative told him to try to pay the loss to “keep out of the courts”. His mother never knew he went to jail as she was taken to India while he was in prison – “if she had found out it would have killed her there and then,” he said – and neither does his older sister. However, he is no longer on speaking terms with his brother, has had to face “doubts” from his children over whether he actually took the money, and lives separately from his wife. Kalia said since the suicide attempts in 2015 he had been living in charity-linked accommodation. “We haven’t gone down the route of divorce,” he said. “I am a telephone call away. But we don’t have a husband and wife matrimonial relationship. They have classified us as a dysfunctional family all because of my conviction.” Joan Bailey, who ran a Post Office and several smaller satellite offices in mid-Wales with her husband, said her husband was referred to a mental health team because he “didn’t see any point now … he was talking about suicide” as Post Office investigators pursued the couple for a shortfall of about £13,000. Over a period of six years she estimated the couple paid about £40,000 – drawing on loans and pensions and trying to save by running the heating for just two hours a night in the bitter Welsh winters – to the Post Office to attempt to cover the continuing incorrect shortfalls thrown up. Chris Trousdale, who in 2002 at just 19 took over a Post Office his family had run for 150 years, told the hearing the IT system would not balance even in his first week with the Post Office trainer “watching every transaction”. He produced records showing that he called the Post Office IT helpline, which he dubbed the “hell line”, almost 200 times over a period of 15 months. After a harrowing experience dealing with Post Office investigators – whom he says used bullying, coercion and intimidation tactics, a common theme repeated by witnesses at the inquiry – he saw a doctor and was diagnosed with acute stress reaction and PTSD. “To this day I look back with a bit of terror,” he said. “They were a law unto themselves. They wanted people to believe they were the police, or bigger than the police.” His mother, who went on to run the Post Office, with a new computer system, was also diagnosed with PTSD. Trousdale, now 39, called for management at Royal Mail and the Post Office to take responsibility. “When I was prosecuted, Adam Crozier was the chief executive,” he said. “I think he should be here answering questions as well as all the other heads of the Post Office. “I don’t think there is anyone who should be allowed to get away with this, it has been happening for 20 years. Bosses were paid bonuses based on performance. Victims’ money [paid to cover the balance shortfalls] in my opinion was going into the pockets of those that had persecuted them.” Crozier, who is chair of Premier Inn-owner Whitbread as well as BT, was chief executive of Royal Mail Group, of which the Post Office was part, from 2003 to 2010.

2/23/2022,"GSK has revealed that its consumer healthcare business, whose brands include Sensodyne toothpaste, Voltaren and Panadol painkillers, will be called Haleon following its planned spinoff and London stock market listing this summer. The drugmaker said Haleon (pronounced “Hay-Lee-On”) was inspired by the merging of the words “Hale”, which is an old English word that means “in good health” and Leon, which is associated with the word “strength”.  The business has grown in size over the years after merging with consumer product portfolios from Novartis and Pfizer, and now generates annual sales of £10bn. The new company’s chairman-designate is the former Tesco boss Sir Dave Lewis, whose top priority at present is to assemble its board. GSK trumpeted Haleon’s growth prospects when it revealed in mid-January it had rebuffed three takeover bids for the venture from the consumer giant Unilever just before Christmas. The last offer was worth £50bn, but the drugmaker said it undervalued the business and its potential. GSK predicted organic sales growth (excluding acquisitions) of 4% to 6% in the medium term, higher than analysts’ forecasts. It believes there is strong demand for Haleon’s products, with people focusing more on health and wellness since the Covid-19 pandemic, coupled with rising demand from an ageing population and emerging middle classes in countries such as China and India. Emma Walmsley, GSK’s chief executive, reiterated on Tuesday that Haleon had “strong prospects for growth, and through listing will unlock significant value for GSK shareholders”. She has been under pressure from the activist investor Elliott Management to explore a sale of the business, rather than a spin-off. The New York hedge fund has also questioned whether she is the right person to lead GSK after the split. the GSK board has firmly backed Walmsley. Brian McNamara, chief executive designate of Haleon, said: “Introducing Haleon to the world marks another step in our journey to become a new, standalone company. Our name is grounded in our purpose to deliver better everyday health with humanity and to be a world leader in consumer healthcare. We are on track to launch Haleon in mid-2022 and our business momentum is strong.” GSK will further update analysts and investors at a capital markets day .

Commenters on social media have been sharing their excitement around the date and the good luck it is rumoured to bring.  One meme doing the rounds captures the mind-blowing confluence of features that make today’s date so distinctive. Stonehenge humbly pointed out that although this palindrome day is a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence for most, it’s not the first time the Wiltshire rock circle has experienced the phenomenon. The University of Oxford pointed out that the last palindrome day of this century will be on a leap day, on 29 February 2092. Several commenters were excited to celebrate their 22nd birthday on the same date as twos day. Another joked about the popularity of palindrome days with wedding venues, given the luck they symbolise, especially in certain cultures. Happy palindrome day — 22022022. You should enjoy it as the next one will be in 11 years, 1 day. The next date featuring only 2s will be 199 years, 345 days from now. Even then, the wedding venue is probably already fully booked.

2/23/2022,"The unfolding crisis in Ukraine poses a diplomatic dilemma for China but also offers an opportunity for Beijing as Joe Biden’s administration is likely to continue to be distracted by Russia ahead of the US mid-term elections later this year. China’s position in this round of Russia v the west is under particularly heavy scrutiny following Xi Jinping’s pledge with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on 4 February that there would be “no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation” in their bilateral relationship.  In the last few days, as the crisis in Ukraine dominated international headlines, Chinese analysts have debated the country’s policy choice. While hardliners advocate a pro-Russia foreign policy, others think Beijing should seize on this crisis to protect ties with Washington. “China ultimately wants good relations with the US,” said Wang Huiyao, president of the Centre for China and Globalisation, a Beijing-based thinktank, who also advises the government. “It is true that Beijing and Moscow have pledged closer cooperation, because both countries have similar concerns over external involvement in their own security issues,” Wang said, adding that China sees some parallels in Nato’s eastward expansion with its own concerns relating to the South China Sea, which, he said “should all be resolved by the countries in the region without foreign interference”. Dr Yu Jie, a senior research fellow on China at London-based thinktank Chatham House, said the crisis highlights a “sticky point” in Beijing’s relationship with Moscow following Xi’s heavy investment in it. “China much hopes Russia would offer full diplomatic support to Beijing’s various global initiatives under a plethora of UN-led platforms, but Moscow’s current move has made China’s wishes more problematic.” Yu also pointed out that some strategists in Beijing now view this situation favourably because the Biden administration is being distracted, and as a result is likely to have less energy and resources to counter China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific – at least prior to US mid-term elections in November this year. So far, China’s position on Russia’s move on Ukraine has been clear: Beijing does not endorse Moscow’s aggression. China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, attempted to clarify this stance over the weekend. “The sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of any country should be respected and safeguarded,” Wang told the Munich Security Conference. “Ukraine is no exception.” On the surface, Beijing’s response fits the diplomatic doctrines it has long advocated internationally. In a major speech to mark the 60th anniversary of the initiation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence on 28 June, 2014, Xi reiterated “mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs”. Yet, analysts highlight Wang’s insistence on respecting “the legitimate security concerns of all countries”, as he told Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, earlier on Tuesday. They say it is a clear indication of Beijing’s sympathy towards Moscow’s view on Nato’s eastward influence. Critics also point to China’s position on Russia in 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea. A few months before Xi’s June speech that year, China abstained in a UN general assembly vote on a resolution that discouraged Russia’s action. From Beijing’s perspective, the crisis in Ukraine is not as clear-cut. While Xi and Putin exhibit a brotherly relationship, China also enjoys friendly ties with Kyiv, and Ukraine offers a commercial opportunity for Xi’s ambitious belt-and-road economic initiative. Ukraine’s trade with China in 2020 was at $15.42bn (£11.37bn). China is Ukraine’s top trading partner. Late on Monday night, China’s embassy in Kyiv told its citizens and companies to refrain from travelling to “areas where the situation remains unstable”. The embassy also advised Ukraine-based Chinese citizens to stock up on daily necessities such as food and drinking water. The embassy cited “significant changes” in the situation in eastern Ukraine for this urgent advisory. On Tuesday morning, Ukraine’s embassy in Beijing issued a Chinese-language statement on the country’s heavily-monitored social media website, Weibo, condemning Russia’s act and accused Moscow of “seriously violating the basic principles of international law”. The Weibo entry soon became the top “hot topic” on Weibo, followed by the topic of “Ukraine” on the same list. The hashtag: Ukraine issues statement on Weibo has been viewed over 300m times as of Tuesday. Over 20,000 comments followed, too. Ryan Hass, a former senior adviser to Barack Obama and senior White House officials, saw an opportunity for Washington to “[sharpen] Beijing’s choices” through this crisis. “This does not mean concessions or a softening approach to PRC [People’s Republic of China],” he wrote on Twitter. “Rather, it requires Beijing seeing a path remaining open for less hostile relations with the west, and significant risks for being linked to Russia’s recklessness. “The goal would not be to seek to compel Beijing to break from Moscow. That is not happening. It would be to help Beijing reach its own judgment that its interests require it to begin a gradual, steady reorientation in the wake of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.”",News/World news,Ukraine crisis poses dilemma for China but also opportunity,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/ukraine-crisis-poses-dilemma-for-china-but-also-opportunity
2/23/2022,"Black carbon pollution from tourism and research activities in Antarctica is likely increasing snowmelt on the continent by an estimated 83 tonnes for each visitor, according to new research. Scientists have estimated that the black carbon produced by vessels, planes and diesel generators results in 23mm of additional snowmelt each summer in the most frequently visited areas of the ice-covered landmass.  More than 74,000 tourists visited Antarctica in the 2019–2020 season, nearly double the figures from a decade ago. A team of researchers sampled the snow yearly between 2016 and 2020 at 28 sites spanning 2000km from Antarctica’s northern tip to the Ellsworth Mountains. They focused primarily on the Antarctic peninsula, where about half of the research facilities on the continent are located and where an estimated 95% of Antarctic tourist trips are made. The team estimated that 53,000 tourists visited Antarctica annually between 2016 and 2020. Study co-author Dr Raúl Cordero, of the University of Santiago Chile, said Antarctic snow was the cleanest on Earth, typically with baseline levels of black carbon around one part in a billion. “That is 1000 times less than what you would find in the Himalayas, and 100 times less than what you can find in the Andes or in the Rocky Mountains,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Black carbon levels at sites on the Antarctic peninsula were between two and four times higher than on other parts of the continent. “What black carbon is doing is making the snow darker [so it] is absorbing more solar radiation,” Cordero said. “That extra energy is accelerating the melting of the snow.” He believes a limit on the number of tourists to Antarctica may need to be adopted. The team quantified the likely snowmelt by calculating how black carbon pollution reduced the snow’s albedo – a measure of how well a surface reflects solar energy. They calculated that an Antarctic researcher’s black carbon footprint was about 10 times greater than a tourist’s. “We estimated that … the snow that is melting faster because of the activities carried out by a researcher would be closer to 1000 tonnes,” Cordero said. “Every researcher is using vessels, planes, helicopters, generators – and everybody’s using diesel for powering these.” Cordero said that while the amount of pollution-induced snowmelt is far less than the ice and snow lost to global warming, the study highlighted the need for a transition to renewable energy sources. “There are technical alternatives to diesel that could be used in Antarctica,” he said, citing the Belgian research station, Princess Elisabeth Antarctica, which is primarily powered by wind. Prof Andrew Mackintosh, head of the school of earth atmosphere and environment at Monash University, who was not involved in the research, said the link between black carbon pollution and increased surface melt was well established in other parts of the world. “In the Antarctic peninsula the two major processes [affecting melting] would still be warming oceans melting ice shelves from beneath, or warming surface air temperatures that are melting the ice from above,” Mackintosh said. “If we have even greater surface warming in [the] decades to centuries ahead, as is projected for the Antarctic peninsula, then the additional black carbon on the surface will cause even more melt than would have occurred otherwise,” he said. “Human activity is causing the polar regions to warm, but the burning of … [fossil] fuels has a direct consequence in terms of surface melt as well.” “If you can get rid of the greenhouse gases in the first place, you’ll reduce the temperature increase,” he said. “There’s also the added benefit of less darkening of the snow surfaces.” Cordero said: “Antarctica is the last continent more or less unpolluted. I think we should try to keep it that way.” The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications.",News/World news,"Black carbon pollution from tourism and research increasing Antarctic snowmelt, study says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/black-carbon-pollution-from-tourism-and-research-increasing-antarctic-snowmelt-study-says
2/23/2022,"Astrain of melancholy Slavic clarinet creeps into the soundtrack of this otherwise breathless documentary about Dozhd TV, the hip young gunslingers of Russian independent broadcasting. It’s as if it’s reminding us that this tale – hopeful foray into western-style liberalism is crushed by autocratic forces – has played out many times in Russian history before. Except that Dozhd (“rain”), founded in 2010 and still in business, hasn’t quite been crushed yet. With its live broadcasts of protests Putin would rather the public didn’t see, it shows remarkable persistence in the face of harassment and intimidation in this closely embedded account by one of its former producers, Vera Krichevskaya. Dozhd’s status as thorn in the side of the Kremlin is all the stranger given its founder, Natasha Sindeeva, was a Moscow noughties good-time girl with no interest in politics. But the channel – with its gay-friendly work culture, funky branding and cheeky satire – quickly picked up a following. Dmitry Medvedev, when he was president, appears to have been a fan. But covering the protests that followed Putin’s third-term election in 2012, and its continued links to opposition politics, put the channel on the official shitlist: removal from lucrative national cable packages, harassment of its staff, eviction, legal prosecution and being labelled as “foreign agents” have all been used to keep Dozhd marginal.  Thankfully no one here gets a polonium sandwich, but Dozhd’s survival still seems like a decade-long experiment in testing the limits of its slogan: the Optimism Channel. Surviving on YouTube and behind a paywall, its value looks a given to anyone who values free speech. But Sindeeva’s banker husband Sasha starts to waver: “Go to war and die heroically? Or live a long life and die from some common sickness? Both scenarios are possible, for a person and for a TV station.” Sindeeva ends up foiling the sickness – a breast cancer diagnosis – and going down the heroic path. Narrating the film with occasional gonzo outbursts (“We were so fucking stupid”), Krichevskaya is perhaps over-infatuated with her subject, but then Sindeeva seems like quite a character.

2/23/2022,"It may not yet feature in a West End musical but scientists say they have found an unexpected response to singin’ in the brain. Researchers say they have found particular groups of neurons that appear to respond selectively to the sound of singing.  Writing in the journal Current Biology, a team of scientists in the US report how they made their discovery by recording electrical activity in the brains of 15 participants, each of whom had electrodes inserted inside their skulls to monitor epileptic seizures before undergoing surgery. The team recorded electrical activity in response to 165 different sounds, from pieces of instrumental music to speech and sounds such as dogs barking, and then processed them using an algorithm. They combined the results with data from fMRI brain scans previously collected from 30 different individuals to map the location of the patterns in the brain. Dr Samuel Norman-Haignere, a co-author of the study based at the University of Rochester, said the team decided to combine the data from the different approaches to overcome their respective weaknesses and combine their strengths. “fMRI is one of the workhorses of human cognitive neuroscience, but it is very coarse. Intracranial data is much more precise but has very poor spatial coverage,” he said. The results confirmed previous findings from fMRI scans that some neurons respond only to speech or respond more strongly to music. However, they also revealed populations of neurons that appear to respond selectively to the sound of singing, showing only very weak responses to other types of music or speech alone. “These results suggest that representations of music are fractionated into subpopulations selective for different types of music, one of which is specialised for the analysis of song,” the team write. The work reveals these song-specific neurons appear to sit in the superior temporal gyrus, close to areas previously identified as responding particularly to music or to speech. The authors write that it is likely the song-selective neurons were not spotted in previous work using fMRI scans alone, since the use of electrodes allows for a finer-grained measures of the activity of neurons. The researchers add work is now under way to understand what it is about singing that these areas of the brain are responding to – for example whether it is pitch and timbre, or melodies and rhythms – while they also hope to explore how such selectivity arose during development or evolution. “Our study presents a first step toward answering these longstanding questions,” the authors write. They also raise the possibility of studying the impact of activating areas of the brain related to songs and exploring interactions with other parts of the brain, noting that songs can elicit particular emotions or memories. Sophie Scott, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study. “The singing voice is the only musical instrument that almost everyone is born with, so one might expect us to have a rather different relationship with human song, relative to other kinds of music,” she said. “We know that there are some significant differences between the brain systems that control how we speak and those that control how we sing, so it’s very interesting that some of these distinctions are also seen when we listen to human song.” Dr Ediz Sohoglu, a cognitive neuroscientist at University of Sussex, said the findings were striking. “One of the interesting questions that arises is why the brain has evolved or been shaped by experience to develop such specialised neurons. Why not just use the same neurons in a multi-purpose fashion to process more than one type of sound?” he said. “One possibility is that having specialised neurons helps a listener to focus on certain sounds in noisy environments. For example, if I am listening to my favourite singer in a concert, I might find it easier to ignore the loud conversation behind me – which would be represented in a different part of my brain.”",News/Science,Scientists find part of brain responds selectively to sound of singing,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/22/scientists-find-part-of-brain-responds-selectively-to-sound-of-singing
2/23/2022,"You probably haven’t heard of Marcel Ries, the Lausanne-based metalsmith who since 2009 has been tasked with engraving the winner’s name on to major Uefa trophies in the moments after the final whistle blows, while someone charges the glitter-cannons and the victors prepare to hoist their freshly personalised pot aloft. Perhaps it was to Ries that Uefa turned on Tuesday, to find out if he is as adept with the Tipp-Ex brush (ask your grandparents) as he is with an engraving pen, and as efficient at taking names off stuff as he is at indelibly adding them.  It is curious that Uefa, in contrast to the other major Swiss institution Guardian readers have been reading about this week, are so very keen on publicly putting names on everything. But though it insisted on Tuesday that “at present there are no plans to change the venue”, it might at this point be regretting the decision to emblazon the name of St Petersburg, the city whose Gazprom Arena the Gazprom-sponsored organisation for some reason chose to host the 2022 Big Cup final, on every single ball used in the competition this year. Whatever its statements say, Uefa is universally predicted to eventually conclude that, as tousle-haired party organiser Boris Johnson put it a little earlier, “it is inconceivable that major international football tournaments can take place in Russia”. Such news will be particularly, and in numerous ways, deflating for these suddenly obsolete balls, who will have to take their thermal bonding, rhombus carcasses and high-grade butyl bladders to the nearest discount bin. Meanwhile it might be time to order a few official Road to Saint Petersburg 22 skips in which to dump the enormous quantity of suddenly obsolete stickers, signage and even bespoke tunnel carpets the continent’s leading clubs are about to have on their hands. Perhaps it is even time to accept that the need for bespoke tunnel carpets is not as great as it once appeared. Later on Tuesday, eyes turn to Villarreal and Chelsea, hosts of the evening’s two last-16 games, to see quite how much of this signage has already been quietly cupboarded. Thomas Tuchel’s European champions host Lille, currently 11th in Ligue 1, with Romelu Lukaku the focus of particular attention after his anonymous performance in Saturday’s win over Crystal Palace, in which he touched the ball only seven times, one of those from kick-off. “It’s of course not what we want,” Tuchel said, “but it’s also not the time to laugh about him, make jokes about him.” Have no fear, Thomas – this is The Fiver, there’s absolutely no chance of that. Join Scott Murray at 8pm (GMT) for hot Big Cup MBM coverage of Chelsea 2-0 Lille, while Barry Glendenning will be on hand for Villarreal 1-1 Juventus. “In life our ego can kill us more than help us. Football challenges you every single day. Every time you are facing a challenge, you have the opportunity to grow and to add new knowledge. So I hope that today I will be a worse coach than I am tomorrow” – Carlos Corberán, high-flying Huddersfield’s boss, gets his chat on with Ben Fisher about working with Bielsa, perfectionism and more. “Reading about Jack Wilshere’s move to Aarhus (yesterday’s Fiver) couldn’t help but remind me of my hometown club’s first ever foray into European competition this season (albeit last summer), when Larne defeated said Danish Superliga mid-table powerhouses over two legs to set up a clash with Paços Ferreira. Given the winner of that tie would play Spurs for a place in the group stages of Tin Pot, it’s now gutting to think that the worst performance of six games on our European journey stopped us from witnessing Spurs in all their Spurs-iness at close quarters. By the way, Aarhus were not happy at losing” – Bryce Brennan. “While not letting the fact that it isn’t really that central get in the way, I have long thought that the Aarhus tourist board have missed a trick not bringing Madness in to sell the town. Maybe now Jack Wilshere has pitched up they could give it a whirl” – Alistair Moffat. “Why is it that on the far side of the world, we are rightly showing compassion and sympathy for ‘our’ Meikayla Moore after her own-goal hat-trick (yesterday’s Quote of the Day), yet when I admit to my fellow Kiwis that I am a long-time and tormented Sunderland fan, they all crack up laughing? Chin up Meikayla, things could be a lot worse” – Matt McILraith. “What’s the protocol in that situation? Did Moore have to find another ball from somewhere and present it to the referee?” – Michael Bland. “Re: yesterday’s Fiver letters. Not only does it seem like years since we last heard from Mac Millings, but if one of the wittier Fiver contributors in history (a small field, I admit) is reduced to mere punctuation pedantry then we really are all going to hell in a handcart. It’s not like it was in my day, etc” – Richard O’Hagan. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport.

Members of the USWNT have reached a landmark agreement with their governing body to end a six-year legal battle over equal pay, securing a deal promising them $24m plus bonuses that match those of the men. Tadcaster Albion are facing a lengthy break from home action after their ground suffered severe damage in the latest storm to hit the Yorkshire town. Sergio Agüero will be off to the Human Rights World Cup after all, joining the Argentina backroom team in Qatar. “I’ll be there with the team, I get along very well with them,” he cheered. “I want to be close to them and try to have fun.” Jürgen Klopp insists nothing has changed for Liverpool’s title hopes despite Manchester City’s late slip-up against Spurs. “The truth is, I was on the way home when it was 2-1 to Tottenham and then I arrived at home and didn’t follow it anymore because I was sure they would equalise,” he tooted. “Then we went out and the driver was very excited and told me that it was 2-2 and then 3-2, I thought City won but it was Tottenham, so ‘Oh’ was my reaction.” St Mirren have brought in Stephen Robinson from Morecambe as their new boss.

2/23/2022,"Light lands softly on concrete walls in a series of silver gelatin prints by an unknown photographer. These small, souvenir-like snapshots give glimpses into the houses of Sri Lanka’s first female architect, Minette de Silva. Here, there are no architectural drawings or models – those have been lost to time. What we see are the personal artifacts of De Silva’s mentee Anuradha Mathur – documents that have been newly uncovered as part of the exhibition The Project of Independence: Architectures of Decolonization in South Asia, 1947–1985, at the Museum of Modern Art. De Silva’s work – shown though this unconventional medium from an unconventional source – sheds light on the architect’s regional modernist architecture that has been largely ignored by institutions in the west. It is among many such materials now being brought to light both literally and metaphorically.  The Project of Independence is a sharply curated collection of about 200 archival and commissioned works, including contemporary photos by Randhir Singh and models by students at Cooper Union. For the first time, the public can see the architecture of “the idealistic societal visions and emancipatory politics of the post-independence period” of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. “They were transforming their countries according to a specific societal and political progressivism,” MoMA chief curator Martino Stierli said. “We wanted to ask, ‘How was this utopian vision grounded in the lives of everyday people?’” Directly after the end of British colonial rule in 1947, South Asian architects used modern architecture to express the self-determination and emancipation of the post-colonial era. Focusing on a specific set of local modernist architects, the exhibition shows a clear break from the British traditionalist architects whose designs projected imperial power. “Often, expressions of modernism are presented as derivative of the west. However, they have their own unique translations and adaptations that are specific of the places they are coming from,” Stierli and co-curator Anoma Pieris explained. “It is not a mirror of the west. It has relevance and significance on its own.” Perhaps the clearest example the new global technologies marrying local traditions and aesthetics was the recently demolished Hall of Nations in New Delhi, by architect Raj Rewal and engineer Mahendra Raj. Built between 1970 and 1972 for the Asia ’72 international trade fair commemorating the 25th anniversary of India’s independence, the multifunctional exhibition space showcased the participating countries under a unique diagrid space from structure made from concrete. Space frames could be considered the pinnacle of modernist innovation in construction techniques. Providing extremely longs spans under lightweight, mass-producible 3D-grid structures, space frames could theoretically cover the globe in flexible, almost uninterrupted space. They represent the innovative engineering and democratic ideals of global modernism. At the Hall of Nations, this globe-spanning technology – usually made of steel – was remarkably built with cast in situ concrete, adapting a universal form to local building techniques and accommodating local materials and labor. The decision to use concrete was twofold: cheap local labor, and high transportation costs of shipping large prefab steel elements on the underdeveloped roads of the newly formed nation. The Hall’s structurally expressive frame is a symbol of a technologically and socially progressive Indian society, while the use of concrete represents self-sufficient independence. It is a clear articulation of the hybridization of European and non-western thought, a recurring theme in the exhibition. This process is captured in an atypical format: an Associated Press film clip of the Hall of Nations under construction is thought to be the only video documentation of the construction of the building, which was sadly demolished in 2017. New architectural languages and solutions paralleled the building of new institutions. This was the first generation of South Asian architects who saw themselves as connected to an international conversation on their own terms. The Hall of Nations brought together international participants under one roof, signaling India as a cosmopolitan, multi-ethnic, multicultural nation-state which had been established under the country’s first post-colonial prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, years before. The four countries were part of the 85-country non-aligned movement, which resisted taking sides in the cold war, instead taking aid from both sides in a show of self-determination, as well as sharing technology and resources in third world solidarity. Founded by the Rockefeller Foundation, the Indian International Center was designed by American architect Joseph Allen Stein with environmentally conscious and socially resonant features such as fired clay screens (jali) to create an international hub that would gather visitors and a local elite to build an international conversation. Reinterpreted historic forms connected locally, but materials – concrete, stone and brick – were sourced from around the world. The post-colonial period wasn’t without struggles, however. The end of British colonial rule and subsequent “partitioning”, or violent delineation of newly formed countries, caused the largest refugee crisis in history, resulting in a building boom. Enormous government-sponsored mass housing blocks were built in a relatively straightforward modernist way, but adapting to local climate and cultural conditions. In Pakistan, the newly formed Muslim-majority government sought ways to articulate a cosmopolitanism in an Islamic state. Pakistani architect Yasmeen Lari’s Anguri Bagh housing demonstrates a turn away from “instant Islamic” architecture, which she saw as an appropriated form. Lari opted instead for a more decentralized and organic aggregation of units designed with direct participation of the previously marginalized community. As with de Silva’s houses, archival materials were not available. The curators instead relied on reproductions of plans and photos from the Aga Khan Foundation. The Project of Independence: Architectures of Decolonization in South Asia, 1947–1985 at the Museum of Modern Art was curated by Stierli, Pieris and Sean Anderson, with Evangelos Kotsioris. It is a major contribution to the continuing global project of uncovering the ways in which modernism was deployed in contexts around the world, helping to realize social and political projects through inventive and context-specific formal and material conditions. The Project of Independence: Architectures of Decolonization in South Asia, 1947–1985 is on view at the Museum of Modern Art in New York until 2 July",Arts/Art and design,‘They were transforming their countries’: South Asian architecture after British rule,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/22/south-asian-architecture-moma-exhibition
