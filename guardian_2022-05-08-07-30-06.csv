5/8/2022,"An extra £1.3bn in military support is to be handed to Ukraine by the UK, in a significant increase in support for the country as it continues to resist Russia’s illegal invasion. In a package that marks the UK’s highest rate of military spending since the end of the Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns, the funding was revealed before a meeting of G7 leaders to discuss what additional help can be given to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s forces. Boris Johnson is also due to meet arms companies to ask for an increase in production. The funding will come from UK reserves after being agreed with the Treasury and will include £300m in military equipment already agreed by Johnson. It includes anti-battery radar systems to target Russian artillery, GPS jamming equipment and night-vision devices. Equipment dispatched by Britain to Ukraine has already played a significant role in picking off Russian tanks and heavy vehicles. The use of NLAWs, or next-generation light anti-tank weapons, became a feature of the early weeks of the conflict as they were easy to deliver and simple for Ukrainian troops to use. “Putin’s brutal attack is not only causing untold devastation in Ukraine, it is also threatening peace and security across Europe,” Johnson said. “The UK was the first country to recognise the scale of the threat and send arms to help the Ukrainians defend themselves. We will stand by that endeavour, working with our allies to ensure Ukraine can continue to push back the Russian invasion and survive as a free and democratic country.” The US president, Joe Biden, has also pledged military help for Ukraine. The next tranche of US equipment will include artillery rounds, counter-artillery radars and electronic jamming equipment. Biden and Johnson will be among G7 leaders holding a virtual meeting with Zelenskiy to mark VE Day and discuss future support.",News/World news,UK poised to hand further £1.3bn military package to Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/uk-poised-to-hand-further-13bn-military-package-to-ukraine
5/8/2022,"The first legal action has been launched against Priti Patel’s plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda as the UN’s refugee agency raised concerns that the UK is “inviting” other European countries to adopt the same divisive immigration policy. Lodged last Tuesday, the legal challenge states that the home secretary’s proposals run contrary to international law and the UN refugee convention, as well as breaching British data protection law. Lawyers believe that the Rwanda plans are a “publicity stunt” to discourage people crossing the Channel in small boats. Patel is refusing to disclose key framework documents explaining which migrants may be eligible to be removed. Larry Bottinick, acting UNHCR representative to Britain, told the Observer: “We are worried that they [the British] are inviting all their European counterparts to do the same. I can understand from their perspective why they would do that – it would give such deals more perceived legitimacy if others do the same.” Denmark has already signalled an interest in outsourcing elements of its asylum system to Rwanda. Bottinick added that Britain would welcome other countries following suit because it would mean even fewer refugees made it to northern France. He warned: “This would increase the pressures on those states neighbouring conflict areas which are already hosting the great majority of those seeking refuge.” The action has been launched by the law firm InstaLaw. The Home Office has three weeks to respond and the process could lead to Patel being challenged in the high court. Stuart Luke, partner at InstaLaw, said their case was based on an Iranian asylum seeker who believes he would face an extremely difficult time if sent to Rwanda. “He could be the only Iranian in the country, there’s no network there, no community, no one who speaks the language. How’s he going to manage, survive? How’s he going to find a job, get educated?” said Luke. Initially the Home Office had given assurances that it would not deport him before 10 May – but on Friday the department backed down and said it was not looking to deport him. Bottinick said that the UNHCR had “serious concerns” over how the Home Office and Rwanda intended to integrate non-African asylum seekers who formed the vast majority of arrivals in the UK. “There will be issues as basic as interpretation for Vietnamese and Albanian speakers. The main arrivals to the UK also include Iranians, Iraqis and Syrians. We have serious concerns about Rwanda’s capacity to integrate these groups.” The legal move came as activists accused Patel of “racist” and “inhumane” policies over the Rwanda plan during her appearance at a Conservative party dinner. The home secretary was speaking at a dinner organised by the Bassetlaw Conservatives in Nottinghamshire on Friday when several activists stood on their chairs and denounced her for the policy. Footage published on social media shows a woman stand up and tell Patel: “Priti Patel, your racist policies are killing people. Your plans to send people seeking asylum to Rwanda are inhumane and are going to ruin people’s lives.” The woman was booed before being led away. A number of other activists then stood up and made statements. The Home Office has been contacted for comment.",News/World news,Priti Patel’s Rwanda plan for UK asylum seekers faces its first legal challenge,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/priti-patels-rwanda-plan-for-uk-asylum-seekers-faces-its-first-legal-challenge
5/8/2022,"Seasons can be turned on a single moment, for better or worse. Jordan Pickford’s brilliance in Everton’s hard-fought victory over Chelsea may provide his side with a springboard to beat the drop. After Mason Mount’s drilled shot beat a diving Pickford and bounced off the inside of one post and on to the other before falling into the path of César Azpilicueta, it looked a certain goal. However, the goalkeeper leapt off the floor and dived full-length to palm away the ball and preserve three precious points. When Pickford rose to his feet, chest out, blood pumping and mouth roaring, Goodison was in raptures, knowing they had witnessed a save of the season contender. “Hopefully when we look back in five games, that has a bit of legacy,” Pickford explains at Everton’s Finch Farm training ground. “For me it’s always nice to have that legacy of a save but I’m a team player, a club player, and it’s all about staying up. We have got five games, we need to focus on each individual game, but I will look back at the end of the season with a smile on my face and say that was a vital three points and a great save.” It was not his only important save of the match; a close-range Antonio Rüdiger shot was repelled in less stylish fashion after the ball smashed into Pickford’s face. “I don’t know if I can remember it, it was that hard. I’ve still got a headache now,” Pickford jokes. “That’s what goalkeeping is all about, getting in the way of the ball. You always do technical work day in day out, but the main thing is stopping the ball from going into the net as best as you can and however that comes across is vital for the team.” Last Sunday’s victory against Chelsea reduced the gap to Leeds in 17th to two points with a game in hand. Everton face a trip to Leicester on Sunday, which gives the team an opportunity to move out of the relegation zone. Pickford will almost certainly be called on again to help a team who have only secured six points away from home all season. Frank Lampard’s side then travel to relegated Watford on Wednesday and will hope to have improved their away points total by the time they welcome Brentford next Sunday. “It is a position we are not expected to be in, but we are. We have to live with that and have the balls to get out of it and stand up and be counted to win the games.” Pickford will be key in the club’s remaining five games, not just for his saves but his leadership qualities. The 28-year-old is maturing as a player and man, aided by his use of a psychologist. “I felt that’s been a massive part of learning about myself a bit more and maturing. When I first started using him it was a really big help. I think sometimes people don’t know who they are until they take a step back and think about what they’ve done.” Pickford is England’s first-choice goalkeeper and accepts the responsibilities that come with the title. Lampard handed Pickford the captain’s armband in Séamus Coleman’s absence at Burnley, a sign of his standing in the squad. “It was great. I always say you need more than one captain in the team; Séamus is the club captain but you need leaders to help Séamus, you need leaders to help the team. If you had 11 leaders on the pitch, it would be amazing but you’ve got to lead in your own way. I feel like I try to be a leader in my way. Sometimes it looks like I’m shouting ridiculously but it’s talking and giving information and trying to lead in that manner. The more leaders you have in the team the better.” Extra aggression has been noticeable in recent Everton matches and Pickford’s own fiery nature is part of his style, but he maintains an equilibrium between the sticks. “You have to be in the moment. I know I like to be revved up but it is about keeping that emotion with a level head. I want to be who I am, but I want to be a calm figure which I feel like I have been for the last 18 months.” The experience of being part of relegation battles earlier in his career will help Pickford in this late stage of the season. “I have been in this situation with Sunderland,” Pickford says. “We stayed up and it was a great feeling. It was a struggle. It was hard work from every single one of the lads. It felt like winning something. It was a big relief and a big reward. It is hard where we are. But the relief you take can be good. The win over Chelsea was very big, so now we focus on Leicester.”",Sport/Football,Jordan Pickford: ‘It’s all about staying up but I hope my save will prove vital’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/07/jordan-pickford-its-all-about-staying-up-but-i-hope-my-save-will-prove-vital
5/8/2022,"Pep Guardiola says he would quit Manchester City if he felt the club’s hierarchy ever lied to him. The Spaniard has always backed his bosses publicly and put his faith in them, even when the club was given a two-year ban from European competitions by Uefa for alleged financial fair play breaches, a suspension that was eventually overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas). “Why did I defend the club and the people? It’s because I work with them,” Guardiola said. “When they are accused of something I ask them: ‘Tell me about that’. They explain and I believe them. I said to them: ‘If you lie to me, the day after I am not here’. I will be out and I will not be your friend anymore. “I put my faith in you because I believe you 100% from day one and I defend the club because of that. When you put something here [sponsor] it’s overpaid, but other [clubs] the money comes from the USA but the money is correct, even if it’s higher. We have to deal with that, we have to fight with that. As always I am a big fan to support this organisation, no doubt.” He added: “It’s a situation in 2012 or 2013, I was still in Barcelona, most of the people running that are not here now, but of course I would not like it. What I like is to represent a club who do things properly [and] well. It’s not about winning the Champions League and the Premier League, we want to do well for our people and our fans.” City are looking to pick themselves up after their dramatic European exit in midweek against Real Madrid in the game against Newcastle . A win at the Etihad on Sunday would take Guardiola one step closer to winning his fourth Premier League title in six seasons in charge. City have been criticised for failing to win the Champions League during Guardiola’s reign, a record that is threatening to overshadow the club’s domestic achievements in that time. “The Premier League is the work daily, the father and the mother wake up every morning to go to work, to bring food home, the day after day after day, this is the Premier League and I like it a lot, especially because we are fighting an extraordinary team in the last three or four years and I feel we push them and they push us to our limits, being there it’s fantastic.”",Sport/Football,Guardiola says he would leave Manchester City if club hierarchy lied to him,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/07/pep-guardiola-i-would-leave-manchester-city-if-club-hierarchy-lied-to-me
