3/9/2022,"Smokey Robinson’s poem “A Black American” sparked a widespread discussion about racial identity following its original performance nearly 18 years ago during the season finale of “Russell Simmons Presents Def Poetry.” While the scripture aimed to educate its readers about the Black experience and what Black people have been called or regarded as over the years, it also sought to explain what being Black meant to the now 82-year-old. During a virtual appearance on “The View” last month, the legendary soul singer-songwriter opened up about the poem after it was turned into an animation by a teacher trying to educate his students about the Black experience during Black History Month. When asked what being Black American means to you, the singer stunned viewers after admitting that he resented being labeled “African American.” It’s a comment, along with others in that same vein, that now has arrested the attention of social media users, who are posting about it online weeks after Robinson’s interview. “I resent being called African American because Black people have contributed so much to the development of the United States of America,” the Motown icon said. “I think that when you do that, you’re disclaiming all the things, the contributions that Black people have made to America,” he added. “You see, I consider myself to be a Black American, and I enjoy being called Black, and Black has been so negativized as a color down throughout history by those who wanted to negativize it. And so, it spilled over into the Black community and to the Black people. And even Black people back in the day calling each other Black was a sign for a fight,” the iconic entertainer continued. “I resent being called African American because Black people have contributed so much to the development of the United States of America,” he added while describing what he calls the greatest gift Blacks gave to America: their lives. “The wonderful Black American who served in the armed forces and gave their lives in all the wars. They did not do that for Timbuktu or Capetown, or Kenya. They did that for Louisiana and Mississippi and Texas and Virginia. Okay? So that’s how I feel about it.” Robinson noted that their contributions should be recognized similarly to their white peers. Robinson’s philosophy is drawing mixed reactions online, including one Twitter user who wrote, “Smokey Robinson… a man born in the 1940’s is on the internet tellin people to drop the African and just call him Black American. Cause he never been to Africa. What’s the stages of Dementia?” Smokey Robinson… a man born in the 1940’s is on the internet tellin people to drop the African and just call him Black American.

3/9/2022,"Ukraine forces attacked Russian vehicles thanks to a tip on Telegram, officials said Tuesday. The vehicles were targeted outside Kyiv, according to the Security Service of Ukraine. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has intensified as Russian troops reportedly shell civilian areas. Ukrainian forces successfully attacked Russian vehicles in the capital city of Kyiv thanks to a public tip made through the encrypted messaging app Telegram, Ukraine's top law-enforcement agency said on Tuesday. The Security Service of Ukraine said in a tweet that it was able to effectively target Russian convoys near Kyiv because of messages sent to an official Telegram bot account called ""STOP Russian War."" ""Your messages about the movement of the enemy through the official chatbot … bring new trophies every day,"" the government agency tweeted. ""This time we received the coordinates of enemy vehicles marked 'V' in Kyiv region,"" it added. ""The result is on this photo: fiery 'greetings' to the invaders,"" the Security Service of Ukraine wrote alongside a photo showing several military vehicles among plumes of black smoke. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the early-morning hours of February 24, targeting several key cities with military strikes. Ukrainian forces have since put up a strong resistance to the Russian troops amid the war that has left hundreds of Ukrainian civilians, including children, dead, according to the United Nations. Ukrainian and international officials have accused Russia of targeting civilian populations with shelling and bombardments. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video message on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces ""destroy the invaders wherever we can."" But he said Russian troops ""still have enough machinery to kill."" ""There are still enough missiles for terror,"" he added. Translations by Oleksandr Vynogradov.

3/9/2022,"Half measures are for the half-hearted. If President Biden and other democratic leaders around the world are really going to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for his brutal invasion of Ukraine, then it’s time to apply the muscle needed to clip his power permanently and smash his ability to wreak destruction wherever he chooses. The way to corral Putin is with robust energy sanctions that will raise prices even more and cause genuine hardship for millions outside of Russia—but pay off in the end. That should be combined with resolute but careful military support, including covert aid. Biden and the leaders of allied nations in Europe, Asia and elsewhere will have to explain coming sacrifices to their people and find ways to rally them if success isn’t quick. Military hawks want the NATO military alliance to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine and confront Russian forces militarily. This is unclever and dangerous and likely to be backfire. Armchair generals should read up on what it takes to establish a no-fly zone over a country the size of Texas. It would be a massive mobilization almost certainly involving losses of NATO aircraft and personnel Russia would be able to target with stand-off weapons. It would also require NATO airstrikes inside Russian territory, to disable air-defense systems that reach into Ukraine. That would give Putin exactly the justification he’s looking for to characterize his demonic jihad as a reaction to NATO aggression. It would also give him the pretext for using tactical nuclear weapons, if he’s willing to go that far. It's easy to understand why Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky continually asks NATO to establish a no-fly zone to limit the Russian bombs and missiles killing civilians and wrecking schools, hospitals, apartment buildings and government offices. But Zelensky must know NATO is not going to do this, since every Western leader commenting on the idea has ruled it out. It’s possible this is a deliberate feint, of sorts: Zelensky keeps asking for an escalation that would undoubtedly trigger Putin, while NATO and other friendly nations keep saying no, while slipping Ukraine other types of military aid that’s a little less escalatory. Know-it-all war commentators should keep in mind there’s always stuff going on behind the scenes during a military conflict. Several nations, including the United States, are rushing defensive weapons into Ukraine, including missiles able to destroy tanks and aircraft. Turkey is sending armed drones that already seem to have helped take out scores of Russian vehicles. This should continue as long as necessary. Ukraine’s own army has so far shown remarkable resolve and more capability than most analysts expected. Build on that for as long as it takes. [Follow Rick Newman on Twitter, sign up for his newsletter or send in your thoughts.] Russia, meanwhile, has revealed some major weaknesses that must alarm Putin, if he’s sane. The most startling is a creaky army that can’t get the job done. Battlefield reports should always be viewed skeptically, yet there seem to be numerous instances in which the long Russia army columns heading toward the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and other cities are stuck for lack of fuel, food and spare parts. Some captured Russian conscripts say they thought they were going to training exercises rather than invading a neighboring country. The mark of a professional military isn’t fancy weapons that shine in parades. It’s logistical competence under stress and discipline among troops who know what the mission is. Russia still has massive amounts of firepower in Ukraine and select units of elite troops, and could regroup. But some of its weaknesses are astonishing. Tanks seem reluctant to leave blacktop roads, for instance, as if they fear bogging down in mud. That makes thousands of Russian vehicles in stalled convoys sitting ducks for any weapon that can get to them. Russia could shut down digital and communication networks in Ukraine, but it hasn’t, possibly because it needs them for its own battlefield communications. Vulnerabilities seem to be everywhere. Putin supposedly rebuilt this force from the tattered remnants of the Soviet Union’s Red Army, financing it with billions in revenue every year from oil and gas sales to the rest of the world. Yet everybody knows Russia is a kleptocracy with officials and businessmen at every level, from Putin on down, siphoning off as much national wealth as they can get for themselves. This story is incomplete, but it now seems corruption and graft have left Putin with a hollow army. Put to the test, it’s turning out to be a flabby spear for Putin to attack his neighbors with. This is the army Putin built with his nation participating fully in the world’s oil and gas markets. So imagine how feeble it would become if Putin lost access to that money, in a sustained way that left him nowhere to turn, not even to his fellow dictators in China. This is where the United States and Europe are heading, and they should inflict maximum financial pain on Putin now that he has shown these glaring vulnerabilities. On March 8, Biden banned U.S. imports of Russian oil and natural gas, with the apparent blessing of Congress. The United States doesn’t buy much Russian energy, and this won’t hurt Putin much. But Biden has set the tone for other nations that need Russian energy a lot more to pass their own bans or at least cut back on Russian energy purchases. On the same day, the United Kingdom said it would phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022, and the European Union said it planned to cut purchases of Russian gas by two-thirds in the same time frame. By 2030, the EU said, it planned to completely end its reliance on Russian gas. Europe buys far more Russian energy than the United States does, and losing Europe as a customer would be crushing to Russia. It will also be hard on Europeans, whose energy bills are already way higher than those in America. They will go higher still. While government sanctions are beginning to squeeze Putin’s war financing, so is the market. Many private-sector purchasers of Russian energy now can’t buy it even if they want to, because sanctions on the financial system make purchase transactions difficult or impossible. Until now, Russia’s giant energy firms have been reliable business partners delivering their product almost regardless of what else is going on. But Putin has wrecked that, too. “Russia has proved it’s not a reliable business partner,” Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics, said in a March 8 call with clients. “Even if there’s some conclusion to the war, there will be some desire to limit exposure to Russia.” Putin and the oligarchs dependent on him for their wealth will seek every possible way to evade sanctions. They’ll find some holes, for sure. This is where Europe and the United States and other allied nations must now make it a strategic, long-term national-security priority to boycott Russian energy for as long as Putin remains in power. Anybody who ever doubted that Putin is a bully undeterred by diplomacy can now see plainly that he will murder civilians and destroy nations to fulfill his egomaniacal ambition as long as he has the power to do so. His missteps in Ukraine now reveal how to torpedo that power. Let Putin continue to rule Russia. Regime change in Russia should not be a public or secret goal of any Western nation. If Putin’s enemies in the Kremlin want to give assassination a shot, that’s their business. But the clear goal of the United States and the full slate of other nations confronting Russia should be the surrender of Ukraine back to Ukrainians, the diminution of Russian military power and a lock on the ATM that enriches Putin and his minions. Putin can have whatever is left after that.

3/9/2022,"FIRST ON FOX: Top Republicans on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) are warning that the United States is facing increased nuclear aggression from foes, and also calling out the Biden administration over its ""far-left"" energy policies that are being exposed by spiking gas prices and other side effects of the Russia-Ukraine war. During a hearing Tuesday, titled the ""Open Annual Worldwide Threats Hearing,"" U.S. intelligence officials warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin is frustrated that his invasion of Ukraine is not going as planned, and that the coming weeks will get ""ugly"" as he takes an even more aggressive approach to try and take over the country. Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, the ranking member of the HPSCI, pressed Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines during the hearing about the possibility that Russia is increasing its nuclear prowess against the U.S. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES ""Would it be correct to characterize that likely your assessment is that the [nuclear] threat is increasing?"" asked Turner during the hearing. Haines responded: ""The threat is increasing generally, yes. I think that is fair."" Turner told Fox News Digital in an exclusive statement after the conclusion of the hearing that there is a growing threat of ""nuclear aggression"" from America's allies due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. ""The growing threat of nuclear aggression from our adversaries was confirmed by our Intelligence Community in today’s hearing. The Biden Administration is currently undertaking its Nuclear Posture Review which will dictate our nuclear policy and the modernization of our nuclear triad. We must act now to update this critical capability, making certain we have a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear deterrent to counter our adversaries."" Members of Congress concluded the public portion of the hearing by noon, and then went into a closed door session later in the afternoon with the intelligence officials. In addition, House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., accused Biden of using the war in Ukraine as a ""shield"" for his far-left energy agenda, and called for American energy independence. ""Make no mistake, Joe Biden's war on American energy is to blame for the price of gas hitting record highs. Biden is using Russia's war in Ukraine as a shield for his Far-Left anti-energy agenda,"" Stefanik told Fox News Digital after the hearing ended. ""Instead of unleashing American energy dominance at home, the Biden administration is turning to other foreign dictators and Russia-aligned regimes to fill this need. We must unleash American energy dominance and no longer depend on our foreign adversaries for oil and gas. That is the only way America can reverse the historic gas prices hurting families across the country and ensure our energy and national security."" Stefanik also questioned FBI Director Chris Wray during the hearing about the tragic Schoharie County limo crash in Upstate New York, which she said was mishandled by the FBI. ""Today, I stood up for Upstate NY families who tragically lost 20 people in the tragic Schoharie County limo crash that could have been avoided had the FBI not turned a blind eye to the criminal actions of the driver – an FBI informant – and his company's long history of negligence. It is part of Congress' job to conduct proper oversight of the FBI's activities, and I will not hesitate to compel all FBI documents regarding the tragic Schoharie County limo crash with a Congressional subpoena next year in a Republican Majority,"" she told Fox News Digital. President Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on importing Russian oil, as the country's deadly war with Ukraine continues. ""It's simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production,"" Biden said Tuesday, pushing back on criticism from Republicans and noting that 90% of onshore oil production takes place on non-federal lands.",Politics/Fox News,"Top intel Republicans warn of nuclear aggression, accuse Biden of using Ukraine war as a 'shield' for policies",https://news.yahoo.com/top-intel-republicans-warn-nuclear-222600274.html

Alexander Vindman. It started when the controversial lawmaker posted a tweet on Sunday claiming “Biden’s poor decision making leading up to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin declaring war on Ukraine.” But Vindman, who as a former national security aide offered key testimony in President Donald Trump’s 2019 impeachment for dealings with Ukraine, refused to let Greene’s statement go by without a fact check. “Nope. It’s because you and your pro-Putin party encouraged Putin to invade, by cheerleading him,” Vindman responded. Vindman’s wife, Rachel Vindman, also chimed in, calling Greene “crazy stupid” and asking, “why do you insist on telling us over and over?” Greene attacked Vindman, saying he wants to “drag Americans into war with Russia with his big tough tweets and his zoom interviews on CNN,” but didn’t deny the substance of his arguments. Nor did she deny or object to him accusing her and the GOP of being “pro-Putin.” This clown wants to drag Americans into war with Russia with his big tough tweets and his zoom interviews on CNN.Go ahead and go fight yourself since you’re from Ukraine.You are clueless about Americans being fed up with sending our sons and daughters to die in foreign lands. https://t.co/hBB2vHUjtN — Rep.

3/9/2022,"(Updates lede with more information about Michael Ferkol's former role in U.S. Army.) By Andrew R.C. Marshall LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Michael Ferkol, who who once served as a supply specialist with engineer battalions in the U.S. Army, had been in Rome studying archaeology when he heard the Ukrainian president's appeal for foreign fighters. Within days, Ferkol said, he presented himself at a military recruiting office in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, hoping to be taken on as a frontline paramedic. ""I told them I wanted to triage patients,"" said the 29-year- old, who has no combat experience. ""There was a Finnish guy there too, and he was like, 'I just want to kill Russians.'"" Ukraine has established an ""international"" legion for people from abroad and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has publicly urged foreigners to ""fight side-by-side with Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals"" to show support for his country. Last week, Zelenskiy said that more than 16,000 foreigners had volunteered, without specifying how many had arrived. Some foreign fighters arriving in Ukraine say they are attracted by the cause: to halt what they view as an unprovoked attack in a once-in-a-generation showdown between the forces of democracy and dictatorship. For others, many of them veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, the Ukraine war also offers a chance to use fighting skills they felt their own governments no longer appreciated. Reuters interviewed 20 foreign fighters or others involved in the effort, and some said that Ukraine is struggling to vet, equip and deploy them. And alongside battle-hardened veterans of war, people are arriving with little or no combat experience, offering limited value in a war zone under constant, terrifying shelling by the Russian military. One man who identified himself as British military veteran referred to these recruits as ""bullet-catchers."" A senior Ukrainian official in Lviv involved in processing newly-arrived foreign volunteers, Roman Shepelyak, said the system to receive, train and deploy foreign fighters was still in its infancy, and that the process would get smoother in the coming days. Ukraine's defence ministry declined to comment. Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, calling it a ""special operation"" to demilitarize Ukraine and capture dangerous nationalists. Ukraine's armed forces are heavily outnumbered by Russia's but have mounted significant resistance. Among those who have arrived to fight for Ukraine are dozens of former soldiers from the British Army's elite Parachute Regiment, according to an ex-soldier from the regiment. Hundreds more would soon follow, he said. Reuters was unable to corroborate those numbers. Often referred to as the Paras, the regiment has in recent years served in Afghanistan and Iraq. ""They're all highly, highly trained, and have seen active service on numerous occasions,"" the ex-soldier from the regiment said. The Ukraine crisis will give them purpose, camaraderie and ""a chance to do what they're good at: fight."" Michael Ferkol said there were many people with Ukrainian ancestry in his hometown, Chicago. He wanted to go to Kyiv, the capital, ""and help out."" ""I'm a little nervous, to be honest,"" he said, making his way through crowds of refugees at Lviv train station on Saturday, hoping to board a train to the frontline. ""But at the same time, it's not about me. It's about the people that are suffering."" 'HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL' For some, travelling to Ukraine, even from far-away countries, was the easy part. Those who hadn't brought body armour, helmets and other equipment with them were struggling to source them in Ukraine, according to several fighters Reuters spoke to. Some veterans were sharing information on equipment and logistics through invite-only Facebook or WhatsApp groups with names like ""Have Gun Will Travel."" These groups contain appeals for equipment, such as body armour and night-vision goggles, or for foreign veterans who are snipers or who can train Ukrainian soldiers in how to use sophisticated weapons that Western countries are sending. With a vast mobilisation of Ukrainian men underway, the country has plenty of volunteer fighters. But there is a shortage of specialists who know how to use Javelin and NLAW anti-tank missiles, which professional soldiers train for months to use properly. Even those with combat experience might struggle in Ukraine's war zones, warned a former British soldier, who asked to be identified by his nickname, Kruger. He said he had served in Afghanistan and trained other soldiers. ""If you're out here as a war tourist, this is not the place for you,"" he said. ""The realities of war, if you head out to the front, are going to be pretty overwhelming."" Many of those arriving in Lviv end up at the semi-fortified offices of the Lviv regional administration, where their paperwork is checked by Shepelyak. He heads the region's department for international technical assistance and cooperation. He acknowledged the system for processing those offering to fight was still in its infancy. On Friday, when Reuters visited, six foreigners appeared at Shepelyak's office, including a Polish military veteran called Michal, and a giant, heavily-tattooed Dutchman called Bert. Both men declined to give their full names. More foreigners were arriving every day, Shepelyak told Reuters. ""If they have such a desire and persuasion to serve a foreign country, it matters. They are important."" Shepelyak said he vetted their paperwork, but not their combat experience, which was evaluated at a military base outside Lviv where they were sent next. He added that those recruited into the Ukrainian army would be paid in line with other soldiers. Other foreign fighters told Reuters they were bypassing the formal processes and heading straight for the eastern front, hoping to get weapons and orders from the Ukrainian military upon their arrival. DELAYED DEPARTURES The logistical issues have prompted some fighters to delay their arrival. Anthony Capone, a wealthy healthcare entrepreneur in New York City, said he is providing funding for hundreds of ex-soldiers and paramedics who want to go to Ukraine. But he said he had delayed their departure ""to give the Ukrainian army another week to improve their enlistment process for those entering the volunteer corps."" So far, according to Capone, only a ""small number"" had arrived in neighbouring Poland. Capone had posted on LinkedIn his message offering funding, thinking that 10 or 15 people would reply. ""Right now, I'm at about 1,000,"" he said. Capone added he was only funding ex-soldiers whose military credentials he could verify, or paramedics who currently worked in an emergency trauma setting. About 60% of those who had been in touch were American and 30% European, with the remainder hailing from at least 25 countries as far-flung as Colombia, Japan and Jamaica, Capone said. Most were ex-soldiers; the rest were emergency medics or critical care nurses. They're willing to ""defend a country they've never visited,"" said Capone, a specialist in computational learning theory. The U.S. government has discouraged citizens from travelling to Ukraine to combat Russian forces. Some countries have issued stronger warnings, including Britain. Others, such as Canada or Germany, have cleared the way for their citizens to get involved. A CONNECTION IN KYIV In central Lviv on Thursday, a burly, Russian-speaking Canadian, who identified himself only as Sig, heaved bags of equipment into the back of a minivan he had bought in Poland and driven to Lviv. He wore a flak jacket bristling with medical tools, and said he usually worked as a civilian paramedic. Another of Sig's four-strong team was an American who said he was born in the former Soviet republic of Georgia and had fought Russians ""for generations."" In Sig's bags were hundreds of kilograms of equipment, including medical supplies and military rations known as MREs, or meals ready to eat. Sig said his team planned to help train Ukrainian volunteers in Lviv for a day, before heading straight for the front. ""I have a connection in Kyiv who will help us out,"" he said. Standing outside the ticket hall of Lviv station on Sunday were a group of British men in military uniform, waiting for a train to Kyiv. They were in high spirits, often exchanging fist-bumps and handshakes with Ukrainian refugees who thanked them for fighting for their country. They were led by Ben Grant, a strapping Englishman from Essex, who said he had served in Britain's Royal Marines and had just completed a stint as a security advisor in Iraq. He was unclear whether his men would be deployed independently or as part of a Ukrainian unit. Of the Ukrainian soldiers, Grant added: ""They seem strong - really strong. I'm more than happy to fight next to them."" (Reporting by Andrew R. C.

3/9/2022,"On the streets of Ukraine, civilians are caught in the crossfire, and credible reports that Russian forces have intentionally targeted populated areas continue to mount. As the army of Russian President Vladimir Putin wages battle across the country, it’s worth remembering that in war not everything is fair. Yahoo News explains the rules of war — and why following them is vital to achieving peace. - On the streets of Ukraine civilians are caught in the crossfire. Or worse, targeted intentionally. ANTONY BLINKEN: We've seen very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians. - As the Army of Russian President Vladimir Putin wages battle across the country, it's worth remembering that in war not everything is fair. - Video released by the Ukrainian government appears to show civilians being caught in an attack on a government building. - Russian forces have brutally fired on Kharkiv from rocket artillery. - If civilians were targeted, that would be a war crime. - So where exactly is the line between acceptable collateral damage and a war crime? That's where the Geneva Conventions come in. Though negotiations date back to the late 19th century, the Geneva Conventions were adopted by just about every country on earth at the end of the Second World War and outlined the rules of armed conflict within a set of four basic agreements. The first deals with fighting on the ground. Wounded soldiers are to be allowed medical treatment. Relief organizations such as the International committees of the Red Cross and Red Crescent are given access to treat the wounded, and medical facilities and personnel are not to be targeted. Additionally, the dead are to be collected from the battlefield and returned whenever possible. The second convention deals with fighting at sea. It applies the same principles as the first convention to soldiers who are wounded, sick, and shipwrecked. The third applies to prisoners of war. Those captured in the course of a conflict are to be treated humanely, meaning they are to receive adequate food, shelter, and medical care, and should never be subjected to torture, execution, or sexual violence. And they must be released promptly following the end of the war. The fourth and final convention is all about civilians. All of the same rules for soldiers apply to non-combatants. And there are even more protections designed to minimize the impact on innocent populations. Occupying forces are not allowed to impede food and medical supplies, and civilians are not to be intentionally targeted in any way, either in their homes or while fleeing the conflict. - Russia and Ukraine have agreed to create humanitarian corridors. - Allowing those thousands of people who have been stuck because of the Russian shelling and firing to come out. SHLOMO ROSILIO: Whoever can get out needs to get out. - These rules are enforced by international humanitarian and criminal law. And exist not only to prevent the worst at the worst of times, but also provide a pathway to peace. The idea is that by limiting suffering, there's less chance for what humanitarian organizations call insurmountable grievances or crimes against a population that simply cannot be forgiven once the war is over.",Politics/Yahoo News Video,War crimes and the Geneva Conventions: Yahoo News Explains,https://news.yahoo.com/war-crimes-geneva-conventions-yahoo-193406045.html

There was no immediate reaction from the Ukrainian side. Russia has attacked Ukraine from the north, east and south, pounding cities including Kyiv, Kharkiv and the port of Mariupol. The invasion launched on Feb. 24, has caused the worst refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two, provoked outrage across the world, and led to heavy sanctions on Moscow. But the Kremlin spokesman insisted Russia was not seeking to make any further territorial claims on Ukraine and said it was ""not true"" that it was demanding Kyiv be handed over. ""We really are finishing the demilitarisation of Ukraine. We will finish it. But the main thing is that Ukraine ceases its military action. They should stop their military action and then no one will shoot,"" he said. On the issue of neutrality, Peskov said: ""They should make amendments to the constitution according to which Ukraine would reject any aims to enter any bloc."" He added: ""We have also spoken about how they should recognise that Crimea is Russian territory and that they need to recognise that Donetsk and Lugansk are independent states. And that’s it. It will stop in a moment."" NEW TALKS The outlining of Russia's demands came as delegations from Russia and Ukraine prepared to meet on Monday for a third round of talks aimed at ending Russia’s war against Ukraine. It began soon after Putin recognised two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian government forces since 2014, as independent - an action denounced as illegal by the West. ""This is not us seizing Lugansk and Donetsk from Ukraine. Donetsk and Lugansk don’t want to be part of Ukraine. But it doesn’t mean they should be destroyed as a result,"" Peskov said. ""For the rest. Ukraine is an independent state that will live as it wants, but under conditions of neutrality."" He said all the demands have been formulated and handed over during the first two rounds of talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations, which took place last week. ""We hope that all this will go OK and they will react in a suitable way,"" Peskov said. Russia had been forced into taking decisive actions to force the demilitarisation of Ukraine, he said, rather than just recognising the independence of the breakaway regions. This was in order to protect the 3 million Russian-speaking population in these republics, who he said were being threatened by 100,000 Ukrainian troops. ""We couldn’t just recognise them. What were we going to do with the 100,000 army that was standing at the border of Donetsk and Lugansk that could attack at any moment. They were being brought U.S. and British weapons all the time,"" he said. In the run-up to the Russian invasion, Ukraine repeatedly and emphatically denied Moscow's assertions that it was about to mount an offensive to take back the separatist regions by force. Peskov said the situation in Ukraine had posed a much greater threat to Russia’s security than it had in 2014, when Russia had also amassed 150,000 troops at its border with Ukraine, prompting fears of a Russian invasion, but had limited its action to the annexation of Crimea. ""Since then the situation has worsened for us. In 2014, they began supplying weapons to Ukraine and preparing the army for NATO, bringing it in line with NATO standards,"" he said. ""In the end what tipped the balance was the lives of these 3 million people in Donbass. We understood they would be attacked."" Peskov said Russia had also had to act in the face of the threat it perceived from NATO, saying it was ""only a matter of time"" before the alliance placed missiles in Ukraine as it had in Poland and Romania. ""We just understood we could not put up with this any more. We had to act,"" he said.
