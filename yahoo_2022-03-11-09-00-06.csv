3/11/2022,"Three years after Brooke Shields uttered those famous words, ""You want to know what comes between me and my Calvins? Nothing,"" she was logging hours taking care of animals at the San Diego Zoo. She had selected the venue as the location of a school-required off-site internship in her last year of high school. She worked there in various departments during the month of May 1983, explaining to UPI at the time that she worked from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekdays. ""To be honest, the thing I did the most was prepare food and clean up poop,"" Shields tells Yahoo Entertainment. ""That was the majority of my tenure at the zoo."" The model and actress, who had already starred in Pretty Baby, Blue Lagoon and Endless Love, also bonded with her charges. ""I worked with the first golden monkey that was born at the zoo, and I used to have to carry her around in a little… almost like a pouch that was right over my heart, so she could feel the warmth and feel my heartbeat,"" Shields recalls. ""She had been born very small."" There were others that Shields remembers by name. ""There was a little chimp named Victor,"" she says. ""And his nasal passages had been blocked, and so he couldn't nurse."" Zoo workers helped him to heal, so he could be reunited with his mom. When asked if she bonded with her her late friend Michael Jackson over their love of chimps, Shields says, ""You know what, Bubbles didn't really like me. I'm not quite sure why. But I didn't get to spend, really, almost any time with Bubbles."" Despite the snub, Shields never lost her affinity for animals — or the San Diego Zoo — and this month she's going back there as it opens the Denny Sanford Wildlife Explorers Basecamp, a section dedicated to immersing visitors in animal habitats. The idea is that people, especially the youngest ones, will leave inspired conservationists looking out for their furry friends. Shields will be part of a VIP event Thursday night, and the Basecamp will be open to all zoo ticket holders the following day. ""What I think is really great now is they’re teaching people sort of how [animals] interact… [And they] learn from their experience,"" Shields says. ""And having that kind of empathy is very different than just being a voyeur of an animal, you know. [The zoo is] really trying to teach kids and people that are experiencing Basecamp to really understand, ‘Oh, this might be what they smell. This might be what they hear.'… And I think that that type of empathy is really what you come out of the Basecamp with."" Empathy for animals is what Shields says she got from the zoo. She had always enjoyed them — she remembers befriending any animal handler who was on The Tonight Show at the same time she was and she did charity work for the ASPCA — but she was already committed to acting, so she never considered being a zookeeper as a profession. She was also committed to college, which she began the following September. (She famously graduated from Princeton University in 1987.) As an adult, Shields has continued to support her former employer. She says the new Basecamp is somewhere she would have liked to take her girls, 18-year-old Rowan and Grier, 15, when they were younger. ""I mean, as a kid,"" she says, ""I would've been filled with wonder."" Don’t mess with Brooke Shields.  At 56 years old, the actress, model and entrepreneur has seen several reinventions. From her career-changing role in 1980’s The Blue Lagoon to co-founding Beginning is Now, a lifestyle platform for women over 40, it’s clear that Shields is in her prime — and she’s picked up many life lessons along the way.  In a new interview with MSNBC, the multi-hyphenated mogul opens up about society’s youth-obsessed culture, explaining that she's in a much better state now than she was in her 20s.",U.S./Yahoo Celebrity,"Brooke Shields shared her late friend Michael Jackson's love of chimps, which she discovered as a teenage intern at the zoo",https://news.yahoo.com/brooke-shields-michael-jackson-intern-zoo-interview-170018291.html
3/11/2022,"Vladimir Putin's plan to seize Ukraine's capital in the first two days of Russia's invasion has been a complete failure, thrown off course by a fierce Ukrainian resistance, poor planning and a series of profound miscalculations. Why it matters: An isolated and angry Putin is expected to double down on his brutality as the war in Ukraine drags on for weeks, months or even years, according to top U.S. intelligence officials. It could be his undoing. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. Driving the news: ""He has no sustainable political end game in the face of what is going to continue to be fierce resistance from the Ukrainians,"" CIA Director Bill Burns testified to a House committee Tuesday. Even if Russia eventually captures Kyiv, the U.S. intelligence community does not see a way that a pro-Russian puppet regime can stay in power given the Ukrainian people's absolute refusal to capitulate. The U.S. estimates that between 2,000 and 4,000 Russian troops have already been killed, ""far in excess"" of what Putin anticipated or has admitted, Burns said. Putin was ready for sanctions, but not the speed and unity with which the Western world brought the hammer down — especially private companies like McDonald's, Starbucks and Coca-Cola, which all halted Russian sales Tuesday. Reality check: Despite the setbacks, Putin is ""unlikely to be deterred,"" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines testified. The people who will suffer most are Ukrainian civilians, who are already beginning to see the vicious tactics Putin adopted to achieve his military aims in Syria and Chechnya. The upside is that what Putin ""might be willing to accept as a victory may change over time, given the significant costs he is incurring,"" Haines predicted. Like this article?

Scientists have been playing god with mosquitos for a couple of years now. Back in 2021, British company Oxitech released 750 million lab-modified mosquitos in Florida. Now, the company is gearing up to release another 2 billion genetically modified mosquitos across more of Florida and in California as well.

The new species, codenames OX5034, is made up entirely of male mosquitos. The new species is derived from the Aeses aegypti family of mosquitos. Just like others the company has released, this new 2 billion should produce female larvae that die off before they reach adulthood. With the success of last year’s Florida release, the U.S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA) has approved Oxitech for additional releases in the Florida Keys. The EPA has also approved a new program with the Delta Mosquito and Vector Control District in California. Furthermore, Oxitech says that it is reaching out to other state regulators to get programs running in more states, too. Female mosquitos are the only mosquitos that bite and are attracted to human blood. Because the new genetically modified mosquitos are all male, the genetic modifications shouldn’t pose any danger to people that encounter them. Oxitech also says the modifications will carry on through other male larvae. This should help the mosquito population lessen over multiple generations. Despite its size, the mosquito is the world’s deadliest animal. That’s because this insect can carry multiple deadly and disabling diseases. Oxitech’s derived its new species from one notorious for carrying Zika, yellow fever, and even dengue. Other species can spread Malaria, lymphatic filariasis, and West Nile Virus. Because it can carry so many different diseases, the mosquito is responsible for over 1 million deaths each year. That’s why Oxitech is releasing so many genetically modified mosquitos, to help cull the population. If we can dramatically lower the population of female mosquitos, we can stop the spread of these deadly diseases in their tracks. Of course, like any animal, not all mosquitos are dangerous. With over 3,000 species of mosquito out there, many of them are completely harmless. Of course, you can’t tell the difference when they’re buzzing around your back porch. Combating insect-borne diseases has been a priority for scientists for years. Despite all the progress we’ve made, the mosquito has continued to be a nuisance. Even with all the practices we’ve put in place to help cut down on mosquito populations growing, half the world still lives in an area where one bit could lead to malaria. With this new species of genetically modified mosquito, we could finally have a concrete way to cut down on the possibility of catching malaria and other deadly diseases.

3/11/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Top U.S. intelligence officials admitted Thursday that they underestimated Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against Russia’s invasion, a mistake for intelligence agencies that have otherwise been lauded for accurately predicting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s intention to launch a war. “My view was that, based on a variety of factors, that the Ukrainians were not as ready as I thought they should be,” said Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. “Therefore, I questioned their will to fight. That was a bad assessment on my part because they have fought bravely and honorably and are doing the right thing.” The White House has faced Republican criticism that it isn't providing enough weapons or intelligence to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Biden administration is currently opposed to a Polish plan to donate old Russian-made warplanes to Ukraine, out of concern that Putin may view that as an escalation by the U.S. or NATO. Berrier testified alongside other top officials before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Generally, U.S. intelligence agencies have won praise from lawmakers of both political parties for their handling of the crisis. Much of the hearing focused on the unprecedented U.S. campaign to declassify intelligence about alleged attempts by Russia to create a fake pretext for its invasion. Even though Putin ordered the invasion anyway, lawmakers say the campaign helped develop support for sanctions that have crippled Russia's economy and pushed previously reluctant Western countries to give military aid to Ukraine. Two weeks into its invasion, Russia has failed to win control of Ukraine's airspace or subdue the capital of Kyiv or other major cities. But the war has had devastating consequences already: An airstrike hitting a maternity hospital, attacks on nuclear plants, and more than 2 million refugees having already fled the country with accounts of possible war crimes. There's no sign Putin intends to de-escalate. Russian propaganda outlets in recent days have promoted false theories that the U.S. and Ukraine are developing chemical weapons. The White House in turn has warned Russia is setting the pretext for its own chemical or biological attack. Berrier, who leads the Pentagon’s primary intelligence arm, said at Thursday’s hearing that just as Putin appeared to have misjudged his army’s ability to subdue Ukraine's much smaller armed forces, so did the U.S. “We made some assumptions about his assumptions, which proved to be very, very flawed,” said Berrier. “I think assessing will, morale, and a will to fight is a very difficult analytical task. We had different inputs from different organizations and we — at least from my perspective as the director — I did not do as well as I could have.” Berrier's admission follows another misjudgment in Afghanistan, whose U.S-backed government collapsed far more quickly to the Taliban than Washington expected. Officials believed the Afghan forces — long trained and funded by the U.S. — could hold out for potentially months after the American withdrawal. Instead, lacking U.S. air power and intelligence support, Afghan forces gave up many cities without a fight last summer. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said that Putin had underestimated the resistance he would face from the Ukrainians. But Haines added: “We did not do as well in terms of predicting the military challenges that he has encountered with his own military.” Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who questioned Berrier and Haines, noted that assessing a foreign military's will to fight was particularly difficult. “But these mistakes had potentially real-world policy implications about the willingness of the president or other NATO leaders to provide weapons that they thought might have fallen into the hands of Russians in a matter of hours,” he said. Cotton and several other Republicans on the intelligence committee criticized the Biden administration’s current refusal to support a Polish plan to donate Russian-made warplanes to Ukraine. Biden administration officials have warned that Putin might view that as an escalation of the conflict. They say planes would go beyond the weapons the Pentagon and Western allies have already given Ukraine, including anti-tank systems and surface-to-air missiles to shoot down Russian aircraft. Asked if the White House was pressuring analysts to assess that the transfer of planes would be seen as escalatory, Haines responded that objectivity was a “core ethic” of intelligence.",Politics/Associated Press,"US misjudged Ukraine's will to fight Russia, officials admit",https://news.yahoo.com/us-misjudged-ukraines-fight-russia-185851020.html
3/11/2022,"Kanye West has been center stage in pop culture all of 2022. He recently celebrated the fact that DONDA 2 is ineligible for Billboard album charts, he released a disturbing and controversial music video, he harassed Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson on social media, and he asked a judge to halt his divorce. Now instead of taking the stage, Mr. West is taking the witness stand in Chicago federal court. Ye has been subpoenaed to testify at the federal trial of his former employee, Arjun Dhillon, who is charged with using his name to try to scam $250,000 from a philanthropist running a charity campaign. The trial is set to begin with jury selection on April 4, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Toasted: Jerk Chicken Empanadas and Mango Chili Sauce The indictment was filed two years ago in January 2020 and only referred to West as “Musician A.” But as the trial date came closer, Dhillon’s attorneys subpoenaed West’s attorneys for records in regards to its representation of the Grammy-winning rapper and other communications the attorneys had about the case. From the Chicago Tribune: According to the indictment, Dhillon in 2019 convinced a Florida-based philanthropist who was running a crowdsourcing charity campaign to wire $250,000 to a bank account purportedly affiliated with one of West’s companies but was actually controlled by Dhillon. The victim was identified in the charges only as Victim A, but sources have told the Tribune he is Bill Pulte, grandson of the late founder of Detroit home-building giant PulteGroup who has found social media stardom by giving away money to charity and documenting it all through Twitter. As part of the ruse, Dhillon created false emails purporting to be between himself and West to convince Pulte that he was close to the artist, when in fact West had ended their relationship in October 2018, according to the charges. Dhillon told the victim West was willing to lend money and star power to the victim’s cause in exchange for financial support of West’s “design studio project,” the indictment stated. According to the Chicago Tribune, the indictment states that once the funds were wired to Dhillon’s account, his bank flagged the transaction. He “falsely represented” to the bank that he worked for West so they would not take the money back. Bill Pulte, the victim in the case, alerted his bank to the potential fraud and they were able to stop the money from being disbursed to Dhillon.
