4/14/2022,"Russia has been accused of ""abandoning"" the bodies of 1,500 soldiers in Ukraine as tens of thousands die during Vladimir Putin’s invasion. Ukraine has claimed more than 20,000 Russian troops have been killed since Putin ordered his troops to begin their offensive on 24 February. While the number has not been independently verified, last month a Nato source put the numbers of Russian soldiers killed at between 7,000 and 15,000. The Kremlin has remained largely quiet about how many of its soldiers have died as a result of Putin's invasion, though it has acknowledged suffering ""significant losses"".

The defence ministry tweeted: ""There are more than 1,500 corpses of Russian soldiers in the morgues of the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Their command isn’t even thinking about bringing them home. ""Dnipro deputy mayor Mykhailo Lysenko said that the city authorities are ready to provide Russian mothers with access to the bodies of their sons, since the government that sent them to die in Ukraine lacks the courage to do so."" Oleksiy Arestovych, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, said on Friday that the Kremlin had refused to accept the corpses of 3,000 of its regular soldiers early in the war.

We don’t have this number. We’re not ready to accept them."" There have been prior reports of the Russian army leaving its dead behind. On 3 March, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed the invaders had brought crematoriums with them to dispose of their dead. He told reporters: ""The Russian people are dying here, nobody is counting them, people dying in this war. Do you know they have brought a cremation chamber with them? ""They're not going to show the bodies to their families. They're not going to tell the mothers that their children died here."" Morale is said to be dropping amongst Russian troops, and Western officials claimed last month that an army commander was killed by a group of demoralised soldiers fed up with the scale of losses during the invasion of Ukraine. The commander of the 37th rifle brigade, named by officials as Colonel Medvechek, is understood to have been run over by one of his own soldiers who had grown frustrated by his unit's heavy losses. Russia is believed to be sending top leaders to the frontlines in a bid to bolster low morale among troops. Putin had reportedly hoped to take over Ukraine in a matter of days, but now seven weeks into the conflict troops have retreated from areas in the north to focus on renewed assault on cities in the south of the country. Since being pushed out of those areas, Putin has faced fresh accusations of war crimes. Ukraine accused Russian troops of killing hundreds of civilians in the town of Bucha, just outside of Kyiv, following their retreat. On Thursday, Russia was expelled from the UN Human Rights Council after delegates voted 93 to 24 to remove them following allegations of Russian soldiers carrying out mass killings, rape and torture. Instead Western intelligence has indicated forces are regrouping for a new eastern offensive in the Donbas region. Zelenskyy told BILD he expects intense fighting in the coming days. ""It could be a big war in Donbas — like the world has not seen in hundreds of years,"" he told the German outlet. ""We will go on defending our country until the end.""",News/Yahoo News UK,"Russia accused of 'abandoning' 1,500 troops killed in battle in Ukraine",https://news.yahoo.com/russia-ukraine-corpses-war-troops-soldiers-104022075.html
4/14/2022,"North Korea released its first feature film in five years yesterday. Titled “A Day and a Night,” the movie is about a heroine who uncovers a plot to overthrow the government.

The movie was produced by Korean April 25 Film Studio, whose name references the day that the Korean People’s Army was founded and is known for producing military-themed films.

In the film, an army nurse “[exposes] plots by anti-party, counter-revolutionary factionalists, despite threats to her life,” according to state media.

 

The nurse appears to have a remarkable resemblance to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, who is described as having a pretty, round face with smiling eyes and hair kept in a simple do, with a soft curl at the bottom.

In the trailer, the heroine is dressed mostly in a simple black and white dress but is also shown wearing the traditional Korean hanbok dress in multiple segments. Happy nature scenes, in which the protagonist is seen dancing or laughing in her hanbok, are contrasted with dark, military scenes, depicting the government traitors. The background characters are also shown as happy and hardworking, all with smiles on their faces, as they interact with the main lead in the town she lives in.

According to the Korean Central News agency, the state news agency of North Korea, the film supposedly “explains in detail the idea that it is a sacred duty and obligation of citizens to defend their leader, at the risk of their lives, and safeguard their system.”

The film also marks the 10-year anniversary of the country’s rule by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who came into power at the end of 2011 after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il.
