4/11/2022,"(Reuters) -Russia will take legal action if the West tries to force it to default on its sovereign debt, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told the pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper on Monday, sharpening Moscow's tone in its financial wrestle with the West. ""Of course we will sue, because we have taken all the necessary steps to ensure that investors receive their payments,"" Siluanov told the newspaper in an interview. ""We will present in court our bills confirming our efforts to pay both in foreign currency and in roubles. It will not be an easy process. We will have to very actively prove our case, despite all the difficulties."" Siluanov did not elaborate on Russia's legal options. Russia faces its first sovereign external default in more than a century after it made arrangements to make an international bond repayment in roubles earlier this week, even though the payment was due in U.S. dollars. Last week, Siluanov said Russia will do everything possible to make sure its creditors are paid. ""Russia tried in good faith to pay off external creditors,"" Siluanov said on Monday. ""Nevertheless, the deliberate policy of Western countries is to artificially create a man-made default by all means."" Siluanov said Russia's external liabilities amount to about 20% of the total public debt, which stood at about 21 trillion roubles ($261.7 billion). Of that, about 4.5-4.7 trillion roubles were external liabilities. Russia has not defaulted on its external debt since the aftermath of its 1917 revolution, but its bonds have now emerged as a flashpoint in its economic tussle with Western countries. A default was unimaginable until recently, with Russia rated as investment grade in the run up to its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" and which on Sunday intensified in eastern Ukraine. ""If an economic and financial war is waged against our country, we are forced to react, while still fulfilling all our obligations,"" Siluanov said. ""If we are not allowed to do it in foreign currency, we do it in roubles.""

4/11/2022,"More than 9 million homebuyers in America have been priced out of the market since January. A rise in all-cash offers and investor purchases is mainly hurting first-time buyers' chances. But prices aren't expected to come down, with the supply of homes for sale in the US at record lows. Rising US interest rates designed to slow inflation have priced more than 9 million homebuyers in America out of the housing market since the start of the year, according to a leading property economist. Nadia Evangelou, senior economist and head of forecasting at the National Association of Realtors, said more than 3 million millennials had been priced out of buying a home since January, with the average monthly price of paying off a home in the US rising by nearly $270. The US Fed has increased interest rates twice this year, with six more rate hikes expected by the end of 2022. That has already led to a big jump in mortgage costs, with the 30-year fixed-rate average now exceeding 4.7%, after beginning the year around 3%. Evangelou said affordability had fallen through the pandemic as house prices rose more quickly than incomes. At the same time, more people were buying second homes with their increased equity, while cash transactions and purchases by investment groups jumped. In California, the NAR said the monthly cost of paying off the median mortgage is more than $500 higher than in January, with fewer than 30% of first-time buyers in the state able to buy a home. The NAR estimates investors make up 22% of buyers across the US, compared with 15% a year ago, while all-cash offers account for 27% of purchases against 19% in early 2020. Conversely, the share of purchases by first-time buyers fell to 27% from 33% last year. ""As more people compete for that smaller pool of homes, prices will go up,"" Evangelou said. But although housing affordability may be plummeting, that doesn't mean Americans are likely to lose their homes if the real estate bubble bursts, Insider's Ben Wick reported. Still, many homebuyers remain frustrated at the situation. Actuarial accountant Rachel Linehan, and her partner Dan, both 23, have been trying to buy a home in Framingham, Massachusetts, for the last four months. In that time, she said that a ""pretty brutal"" market of rising rates had shrunk their budget by up to $100,000, limiting the range of available homes in their preferred area. Linehan recalls arriving at an open house viewing and waiting in a line stretching around the corner. She felt she and her partner had a ""pretty good shot"" of buying a home, with a good salary, no debt, and no kids. ""It's pretty demoralizing. We went in feeling pretty hopeful but that hope has diminished over time to the point where we are feeling pretty small,"" she said. ""We're getting to the point where we might give up soon."" A falling margin of affordability has been exacerbated by supply shortages, which Evangelou said are the worst on record, with 850,000 homes for sale in January. She said it means the availability of homes for middle-class buyers has fallen 60% since the beginning of the pandemic, with one affordable listing for every 125 households now compared to one for every 45 households in 2019. Jonathan Tatum, a 27-year-old revenue data manager, finds he is routinely competing with up to 40 other buyers to purchase a home in Atlanta, Georgia. Buyers' newfound willingness to pay the appraisal gap, which is the difference between the bank's valuation of a home and the price under offer, was locking Tatum out. He said: ""If I see a home that's $550,000 home, even though I can afford the mortgage and the monthly payment, there's no way I could afford a $75,000 payment and a $50,000 appraisal gap on top of that."" Other obstacles, like a growing trend of unpaid rent-back agreements, where sellers demand to live in their home after sale rent-free until they find a new property, made most offers a non-starter, he added. Tatum, who has grown numb to rejection, sees no other option than to continue to try and buy, having seen prices rise since he graduated from college in 2018. He said: ""I don't see people magically wanting to not own a home. If you want a home, it's probably because you don't want to rent anymore. ""Waiting is only going to make it worse."" It is a sentiment echoed by Evangelou, with the NAR forecasting sustained price rises, though at a slower rate of between 4% and 6% this year. ""If you are in a position to buy a home, if you feel financially secure, just go for it. Because don't expect mortgage rates to come down,"" Evangelou said. Economists at the NAR say the only solution is for a strong push to build more houses in the US to accommodate a growing market of priced-out Americans. Until then, growing numbers will continue to fight for a shrinking stock of homes.

4/11/2022,"By Mimosa Spencer and Layli Foroudi PARIS (Reuters) -Supporters of France's far-right and hard-left parties celebrated as presidential candidates for traditional mainstream parties failed dismally in Sunday's first-round vote. As vote counting continued, President Emmanuel Macron was ahead of far-right party leader Marine Le Pen and polling firms estimated that far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon would win over 22% of the vote, compared to under 20% five years ago. In a hall at the edge of Paris, a few hundred Rassemblement National supporters erupted into cheers as TV stations announced Le Pen had again made it into the second round, and with a higher score than the 21.3% in 2017. They waved French flags and shouted ""Marine for president"" as Le Pen spoke to her supporters and called on voters for conservative Valerie Pecresse and rival hard-right candidate Eric Zemmour to rally behind her. Several militants said their party was no longer ostracised by the general public and that they had generally received a warm welcome when canvassing for Le Pen. ""We are greeted in a completely different manner when we distribute party leaflets, we see it when we go to markets, we see people who are much more receptive - something has changed,"" longtime Le Pen supporter Nathalie Vaccari, 57, said. With crowds jumping on stage and singing ""on a gagne"" (we have won), Le Pen's deputy campaign manager Jean-Philippe Tanguy said he was confident Le Pen could win over voters who have voted for Zemmour and Melenchon in the first round. At a packed Cirque d'Hiver theatre in central Paris, some Melenchon fans burst into tears when the first results were announced and hundreds of supporters sang for joy, chanting ""on ne lache rien"" (we won't give an inch) throughout the night. Actor Xavier Mathieu, who led the singing, said he regretted that Melenchon had not qualified for the second round, but was happy about his candidate's strong showing. ""The race is not finished because change in society does not happen in elections, it happens in the street,"" he said. Jeroen Atputharajah, 18, blamed green candidate Yannick Jadot and socialist Anne Hidalgo for not backing Melenchon. ""They preferred to divide the left,"" he said. Polling firms forecast Jadot at under 5% of the first-round vote, while Hidalgo was seen getting under 2%, a record low for the party that helped Francois Hollande win the 2012 election. At the conservative party's venue, supporters had the blues, with Valerie Pecresse seen scoring less than 5%, compared to the 20.01% her predecessor Francois Fillon won five years ago. Some 200 activists lingered after Precresse left, finishing the champagne, eating canapés, and pondering the outlook for their party, which dominated French politics for decades. Kinata Kopi, wearing a T-shirt saying ""Valerie je t’aime"", said Republicans now had to stick together to prepare the 2027 election. ""I hope General de Gaulle and (former president) Jacques Chirac will inspire us so that the Republicans's flame remains alight,"" she said.
