12/24/2021,"A Minneapolis jury reached an ""outcome"" on Thursday in the trial of Kim Potter, a former police officer charged with fatally shooting Daunte Wright, a Black motorist — accidentally, she's claimed, by grabbing her gun instead of a Taser. Hennepin County Judge Regina Chu is expected to reveal the outcome — reached by a panel of two Asian Americans, one Black person and nine white people — between 1:30 p.m. and 2 p.m. CST. Potter, a former Brooklyn Center police officer, who is white, has pleaded not guilty to first- and second-degree manslaughter charges for the April 11 death of 20-year-old Wright. The fatal shooting fueled protests not just in Minnesota, but across the country, as demonstrators rallied against police violence and racial injustice. While prosecutors and the defense agree that Potter didn't set out to kill Wright when he was pulled over earlier this year, they disagree about her potential criminal culpability. A conviction on first-degree manslaughter would mean Potter improperly used ""such force and violence that death of or great bodily harm to any person was reasonably foreseeable."" The second-degree manslaughter charge alleges that Potter's ""culpable negligence"" created ""unreasonable risk, and consciously takes chances of causing death or great bodily harm to another."" The charges carry a maximum sentence of 15 years and 10 years, respectively. Wright's fatal shooting happened about 10 miles from the courthouse where former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin was on trial for the slaying of George Floyd. Days later, Chauvin, who is white, was convicted of second- and third-degree murder, as well as second-degree manslaughter, in the May 25, 2020, killing of Floyd, a Black man, whose death touched off a summer of national protests calling for an end to institutional racism. Potter's trial was held in the same courtroom where Chauvin's trial was carried out. A tearful Potter testified in her own defense last week and described a ""chaotic"" scene that required her to make a split-second decision. Wright was being arrested on an outstanding weapons charge when he tried getting back into his car. Potter testified that she feared for the safety of another officer, Sgt. Mychal Johnson, who was struggling with Wright from the passenger side. Potter holstered her Glock on her right, dominant side and her Taser on the left. The prosecution played footage from Potter's body camera for jurors, showing how the officer had the Glock in her hand for at least five seconds before firing the deadly round. The Glock used to kill Wright weighed 2.11 pounds, compared to the .94-pound Taser that emanates light and needed a safety switch to be pulled before use, prosecutors said.

12/24/2021,"When relatives hadn’t heard from the seven members of the Hernandez family for a few days, they asked authorities in Minnesota do a wellness check on Saturday night. What police discovered shocked the community of Moorhead, a small city on the North Dakota border, to the core: all seven family members, ranging in age from 37 to 7, were lying dead in their beds in the duplex home. “I went to the floor above and I entered into the room and all the family was together,” Eric Bravo Mejia, a pastor who knew the family and rushed to the home after getting a panicked phone call on Saturday, told Valley News Live. “They were there dead. And I went to another room and there was the niece dead. And the uncle. Also dead. All dead. It was an impact that at this moment I can’t even understand. It’s something you can’t even explain, the impact it has in seeing them all there.” Authorities initially said it wasn’t clear how the family perished, but they ruled out criminal activity and said there were no signs of obvious trauma. On Wednesday, Police Chief Shannon Monroe said investigators had found the cause of the shocking incident: carbon monoxide poisoning. As reported by the Star Tribune, the family had lived in Minnesota for seven years after immigrating from Honduras. Their deaths were also reported by local Honduran outlets, which claimed the family was from San Francisco de Yojoa, a town about two hours south of San Pedro Sula. The household included brothers Belin Hernandez, 37, and Eldor Hernandez Castillo, 32, as well as Marleny Pinto, 34, and her 19-year-old niece Mariela Guzman Pinto. There were also three children: Breylin Hernandez, 16; Mike Hernandez, 7; Marbely Hernandez, 5. “These are terrific members of our community and this is a huge and tragic loss at the holiday season,” Monroe said. While searching the home, investigators identified two potential sources of the poisoning: a furnace and a Kia van that were both in the garage. It was not immediately clear that the furnace was broken, which would cause poisoning, and the family had been found dressed “lightly,” indicating that the home was properly heated on the evening of their deaths. And though the battery on the Kia was dead, the gas tank was not empty, which Monroe claims is usually the case when a car causes monoxide poisoning. Investigators are testing the victims’ blood to see if hydrogen cyanide, a chemical found from motor exhaust, is detected. Though a carbon monoxide detector was found inside the house, it had been removed from the wall and was missing batteries. Ultra Devout Sisters Cut Off Contact With Mom—Then Mysteriously Ended Up Dead With Dad According to Minnesota law, detectors must be installed by landlords within 10 feet of each room in multifamily buildings. Occupants of these homes, however, must ensure that monitors are maintained and functioning. The Hernandez family had already endured extraordinary hardship leaving their home country, Mejia said. “They always tried to be very united together. My heart hurts because I love them so much. It’s so painful for me. They were a family. A family well loved,” he said. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!

12/24/2021,"A jury has found former Brooklyn Center, Minn., Police Officer Kim Potter guilty of manslaughter in the death of Black motorist Daunte Wright, following a two-week trial and 27 hours of deliberation by the 12 jurors. Potter fatally shot Wright, 20, after she and an officer trainee pulled him over in the Minneapolis suburb on April 11. They, along with a third officer, attempted to arrest him when he tried to take off with his girlfriend in the car. Potter’s bodycam footage shows her threatening to use her Taser multiple times during the struggle to remove him from the car. She then fired off a shot but grabbed her gun instead of the Taser. In the video, Potter exclaims: “I grabbed the wrong f***ing gun.” She was found guilty on a charge of first-degree manslaughter, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and a $30,000 fine according to Minnesota law, and also a second-degree charge, for causing someone’s death through culpable negligence, which has a maximum sentence of 10 years and a $20,000 fine. At one point, the jury appeared to be deadlocked or at least struggling in making a decision. Tuesday night, the panel sent a question to Judge Regina Chu asking: “If the jury cannot reach consensus what is the guidance around how long and what steps should be taken?” Chu reread a portion of the jury instructions she had previously told them before. “You should discuss the case with one another and deliberate with a view toward reaching agreement, if you can do so without violating your individual judgment,” she said, in part. For a conviction, the state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Potter handled her firearm “recklessly” and showed culpable negligence in her actions that resulted in Wright’s killing. Prosecutors focused on Potter’s training and that she should have known the difference in weight and feel of the weapons. She carried a gun on her duty belt her entire 26-year career and a Taser since 2005, according to court testimony. Potter retrained for use of both each year she equipped them, prosecutors said, adding there was no excuse for “weapons confusion.” “Members of the jury, the defendant told you her sons will be home for the holidays. You know who won't be home for the holidays…is Daunte Wright,” said prosecuting attorney Erin Eldridge during closing arguments. “What this case is really about is about an officer who mishandled her firearm,” Eldridge later went on to say. “That’s why we're here and even if you take the defendant’s word for it — she admits — that’s what she did. She told you in court she knew it was wrong and she knew from the very beginning.” When Potter testified last week, she broke down while giving her account of what happened, saying “we were trying to keep him from driving away, it just went chaotic and then I remember yelling ‘Taser, Taser, Taser’ and nothing happened and then he told me I shot him.” Potter’s defense team argued Potter not only had the right to use her taser but also her gun, had she intended to, because of the danger her fellow officers faced. ""Did they prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she caused this death? No. Daunte Wright caused his own death, unfortunately,"" Earl Gray, her defense attorney, said during his closing arguments. Gray added that the two officers involved in the incident, Officer Anthony Luckey and then-Sergeant Mychal Johnson, believed she was justified based on comments made that day and in court. He walked the jury through a vantage point of what happened when officers told Wright to get out of the car. “[Wright] hesitated and he said ‘Why?’ And then he got out of the car and Officer Luckey, being a nice guy, he could have taken him and thrown him against the car and put his knee on his neck. No, he said ‘put your hands behind your back, I'm going to handcuff you.’” A knee on the neck is a reference to the killing of George Floyd by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Gray continued: “Within seconds, he all of a sudden breaks away. That’s the cause, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. That's what caused this whole incident. If he would've gone with the officers, been handcuffed, go to the squad car, go take a ride downtown and it's over. Eldridge argued that Potter was responsible. “The defendant alone is responsible for her choices and her actions. Daunte Wright did not cause his own death. We're here because this was entirely preventable. It didn’t have to happen. It was a tragedy of her own making and it’s not just a tragedy, it’s manslaughter,” she said. “Her actions were rash and reckless and what she did was wrong.” Benjamin Crump, a prominent civil rights attorney, described the family as “very emotional, anxious, just very much,” in an interview with Yahoo News Tuesday. He serves as co-counsel for the family and drew parallels between this case and that of Mohamed Noor, a Black former Minneapolis police officer who was found guilty in the shooting death of a white female in 2019. “Now in the case of Officer Noor, he said, number one, ‘I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. It was a mistake.’ He cried. He was remorseful. Number two, he said, ‘the reason I did what I did was because I was trying to protect my fellow officer. I was worried about his safety. I didn't want him to get killed,’” Crump said, adding that the same court in Hennepin County decided Noor violated police department policies in his actions. “They convicted him and sentenced him for 12 years for killing an unarmed white woman, in what many believe a far worse situation than Kim Potter because it was pitch dark. They couldn't see what she was reaching for. And then you look at what happened to him, so you say, ‘well, if it did not work for him, why should [Potter] escape culpability?’ We can't have two different systems of justice in America.” He added: “And all we're saying is we want equal justice for Daunte Wright. Don't change your rules when it's one of our children lying dead on the ground.” The jury makeup included nine white people that are white, two Asian Americans and one Black person, according to how the jurors self-identified to the court. Six were men and six were women. Their ages ranged from 20s to 60s. Judge Chu said sentencing will take place on Feb. 18, 2022, at 9 a.m Central Standard Time. Until then, Potter will be taken into custody and held without bail. ",U.S./Yahoo News,Jury finds Kim Potter guilty in Daunte Wright traffic stop shooting,https://news.yahoo.com/jury-finds-kim-potter-guilty-in-daunte-wright-traffic-stop-shooting-193617460.html
