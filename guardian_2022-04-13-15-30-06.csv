4/13/2022,"Households in Britain have come under renewed pressure from the soaring cost of living after the official inflation rate reached 7% last month. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the latest rise in the consumer price index was the fastest in three decades, coming a month after the barometer for rising living costs jumped by 6.2% in February. City economists had forecast a rate of 6.7%. Further increases are expected as the impact of the war in Ukraine drives up the cost of energy and raw materials, with households likely to feel the squeeze from higher gas and electricity bills. The Bank of England has warned inflation is on track to reach 8% this month and could peak close to 10% later this year, the highest rate in four decades.

4/13/2022,"Ayesha Malik’s hair was once so lush – glossy, with ringlets worthy of a Disney movie – that she had to prove on YouTube that she didn’t wear a wig or use a curling iron. At the time, Malik was a devotee of DevaCurl, a line of products designed specifically for curly hair, something she had found hard to come by in her home town of Anchorage, Alaska. Malik first promoted DevaCurl as a fan – she credited the company with transforming her relationship to her hair – and then as an influencer. But by January 2019, nearly six years into use of DevaCurl products, something was off. Her hair appeared brittle and fried. The ringlets straightened out. Her scalp itched terribly, and she started losing handfuls of hair in the shower. She developed consistent tinnitus and anxiety, struggled with memory loss and delayed speech, and withdrew from her work on social media. Though she had received several concerned DMs from followers experiencing similar hair damage, it wasn’t until she joined a Facebook group later that summer that she admitted the culprit could be her beloved hair products. The group, Hair Damage & Hair Loss from DevaCurl – You’re not CRAZY or ALONE, started by Orlando-based hair stylist Stephanie Mero, had 3,000 members at the time who all experienced similar damage they attributed to DevaCurl. (The group now has close to 60,000 members.) Malik read the posts and cried in recognition and horror, though “it still took me a few months to process, because I was still in denial”, she told the Guardian. She felt as though she’d been in a long-term relationship with the brand. “The betrayal is just so hard to fathom,” she said. “Why would you harm me? You’re supposed to be the complete opposite of that.” Malik’s experience with DevaCurl is one cautionary tale in Not So Pretty, a new HBO Max documentary series from investigative film-makers Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick, known for sexual assault docs On the Record and Allen v Farrow, on toxic chemicals in the beauty industry and the lax regulation, lack of oversight and corporate lobbying which allows for routine US consumer exposure to dangerous substances. The series, narrated by the actor Keke Palmer, consists of four succinct yet sprawling half-hour episodes on different aspects of the multibillion-dollar beauty industry. The hair episode includes Malik, Mero and others with hair damage they believe is associated with DevaCurl, as well as a survey of the Eurocentric beauty standards and discrimination that has fueled marketing of dangerous hair relaxers to black women for decades. Nails explores the serious health risks faced by salon employees, who are predominantly immigrants and people of color. Skincare investigates products and plastic packaging with PFAS compounds, AKA “forever chemicals”, linked to cancer, birth defects, liver disease, thyroid disease, decreased immunity, hormone disruption and other health problems. Makeup covers similar concerns in cosmetics, with a special focus on evidence that Johnson & Johnson knew its talc-based baby powder contained asbestos as far back as the mid-1970s (the company, facing thousands of lawsuits, withdrew the product in North America in 2020). There’s a common theme across all four: the personal care products we consume, often without thought and under the assumption that there’s some regulatory friction before something is on store shelves, are not nearly as safe as you think they are. (This goes for more than just cosmetics — the Guardian’s series Toxic America has found harmful chemicals in everything from food to children’s toys to pizza boxes to tap water.) “So many of the things we put on our bodies, we don’t even think to ask about, or even think it’s our place to question,” Ziering said. “It’s just so part of our culture, just to buy stuff.” Personal care products – daily shampoo and conditioners, nail polish, moisturizers, perfumes, etc – have particularly lax regulation in the US. While the EU has banned or restricted more than 1,300 chemicals in cosmetics alone, the US has outlawed just 11 toxic ingredients. There are currently no legal requirements for cosmetic manufacturers to test their products before selling them to consumers. If consumers are harmed, there’s little the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the regulatory body supposedly protecting consumers, can do; the enfeebled agency can merely request a company issue a voluntary recall. “Pretty much every other chemical in every other industry has some sort of oversight, and in cosmetics, there’s almost none,” Dick said. “We were shocked to see that something that was so common, so ubiquitous, that everybody uses, there was almost no regulation. And what that means is that consumers have to be aware.” It’s alleged that Malik’s hair and health were damaged by ingredients in DevaCurl products which released formaldehyde, a known human carcinogen banned in EU-sold cosmetics but still found in hair relaxers and nail polish. (The company has maintained that their products are safe and that hair loss and other damage can be attributed to other factors. According to a statement given to the film-makers: “we have not seen a single medical record, laboratory test, or diagnosis from a doctor or scientific professional to support the claims made in this TV program.”) The film-makers found that the FDA received more than 1,500 reports of damage by DevaCurl, from hair loss to migraines to ulcers, but the agency could not issue a recall. The company has since reformulated their products. Though the FDA requires cosmetics to have an “ingredient declaration”, toxic chemicals can still lurk in commonly used products. Fragrance formulations, for example, are considered a “trade secret” and thus protected from disclosure to regulators or manufacturers, meaning that the 4,000 chemicals currently used to scent products in the US – some of which cause irritation, endocrine disruption, or are linked to cancer – never make it to the label. A 2019 study by industrial chemist Ladan Khandel on gel nail polish, conducted when she was a master’s student in environmental health at University of California, Berkeley, found dangerous ingredients not disclosed on the safety data sheets required by California law. Such chemicals included formaldehyde, benzene, toluene and methyl methacrylate, “which are all pretty toxic and would definitely need to be disclosed if they were in the original formulation of the product”, said Khandel, who appears in the second episode and runs a Instagram account dedicated to the toxicology of beauty. “People really need to know what they’re being exposed to, and the safety data sheets need to show it,” she added. “It should be on the manufacturers to prove their products are safe before it goes to market.” Ziering, too, puts the onus on companies to ensure their products are safe, something not found in the final two episodes, which explore decades of allegations against Johnson & Johnson, Exxon Mobil-produced chemicals in beauty products and packaging, and lobbying efforts to weaken consumer protection. “We are a nation of multinational corporations that parades as a democracy,” said Ziering. “We’re suffering from the lack of ethical leadership at the head of these corporations, and the lack of an ideology that implores that they have ethical imperatives.” “It is not in [companies’] interests, in most cases, to dive in and fix the problem,” Dick added. “Usually the solution is to ignore it and hope it goes away.” That appeared to be DevaCurl’s strategy, but the damage has not gone away for Malik. Though her hair health has improved, she still struggles with tinnitus, anxiety and scalp irritation. The damage led her to “completely detox my life because I don’t trust any American brand no matter what it is”, she said. Not So Pretty ends each episode with a didactic section along these lines: the dos and don’ts of each sector, from apps which research ingredients on your household products to an endorsement of the Safer Beauty Bill package, a series of proposed laws to ban certain chemicals in cosmetics, including PFAS, phthalates and formaldehyde, and require more ingredient transparency. But for now, the onus remains primarily on the consumer. “You have power as a consumer,” said Ziering. “We are not powerless, and where you put your money is where companies will follow your lead. They have to. So purchase wisely, and purchase thoughtfully.” Not So Pretty is now available on HBO Max with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Television & radio,‘People really need to know’: can we trust beauty products to be safe?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/13/not-so-pretty-hbo-max-docuseries-beauty-products-safety
4/13/2022,"Wooden slats, a hard chair, scraps of paper, thin cushions, a small desk, cold coffee cups, morning light and the sound of birds; after more than 15 years of what I believe we call economic activity, I am finally getting a room of my own. Yes, I am building a shed. Like Dylan Thomas, Roald Dahl and probably that guy with glasses off The Repair Shop, I shall henceforth be working out of the house, looking at a rosemary bush. As a woman, I now believe that this is the only way to work from home without sinking constantly into the mire of housework. I say women, because, as pretty much every sociological report on the subject has proved, within cis-gendered, heterosexual relationships, women still do the majority of domestic labour. A foul concoction of social conditioning, an unfair labour market, pay inequality and unaffordable childcare means that it is primarily women who hang out the laundry, wipe the counter tops, clean the bath and not only notice that the floor is covered in grated cheese but then take the radical step of sweeping up the grated cheese. While working from home is a privilege only afforded to people in a certain type of job – often non-essential, non-public-facing and computer-based – it has meant that many of us are now having our working day interrupted by the guilt-inducing sight of a full washing up bowl or a child’s pyjamas hanging from a doorknob. Not to mention the lure of the fridge or the tantalising song of the kettle. And so, I’m heading out into the garden. I am shutting the door on crumbs, scattered toys, snacks and unmade beds, and taking dominion of my own office. Will I start to write meandering novellas about middle-class families with neurotic heroines? Will I find myself penning fulsome Welsh poetry and drinking whisky for breakfast? Will I create a children’s classic, while idly watching a magpie? I very much doubt it. But I will be facing a window, with a swept floor and nobody asking me to wipe their bum. Pure joy.

4/13/2022,"High-profile independents vying for a place in the next parliament have vowed to push for an increase to the jobseeker payment after Labor dumped plans to review the benefit. In a move that angered welfare groups, Labor on Tuesday confirmed it would not commit to lifting the payment – currently at a base rate of $46 a day – and had ditched an independent review proposed in 2019, citing budget constraints. But several independents – including current MPs and first-time “teal” candidates campaigning on climate and integrity – argue the payment is inadequate and must be addressed in the next parliament. They have joined the Greens who have pledged to lift all payments to the Henderson poverty line of $88 a day. Zoe Daniel, the former ABC journalist taking on Liberal MP Tim Wilson in the Melbourne seat of Goldstein, said she backed an initial call from welfare groups for a $150-a-fortnight increase to the payment. The Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) now calls for a more generous increase – lifting jobseeker to the pension rate of $70 a day. That’s a rise of more than $330 a fortnight. “If elected I will take further expert advice on the dollar amount, but on the face of it I believe an increase of $75 per week in jobseeker to be overdue and justified on both equity and economic grounds,” Daniel said. Daniel said top economist Chris Richardson had found an increase would “not only lift jobseeker recipients out of dire poverty, but would grow the economy and create additional jobs”. “Should the parliament be in a state of minority government after the election, the men vying to be prime minister would be well aware of my position on this issue,” she said. Kylea Tink, who is running against moderate Liberal Trent Zimmerman in North Sydney, said the current rate of jobseeker forced “people to subsist below the poverty level, so I do believe there’s a reasonable argument it should be increased”. She did not give a specific figure. Zali Steggall and Rebekha Sharkie, who both represent traditionally Liberal-voting seats, also backed an increase to the payment, as did Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie. Labor’s decision to ditch any commitment over jobseeker was met with dismay on Monday. The Antipoverty Centre labelled it a “devastating blow” while Acoss chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, questioned how anyone could “claim to care about the cost of living without addressing the inadequacy of jobseeker”. Meanwhile the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, claimed Labor had made a “heartbreaking move to the right” by refusing to lift income support payments. The Greens’ policy launched last month would see all welfare payments increased to a base rate of $88 a day, with taper rates and conditions, costing $88bn over the forward estimates. Steggall told Guardian Australia she believed the payment should be lifted to “at least $60 a day”, or $840 a fortnight, up from the current rate of $642.70 for a single person with no children. “People with less money are more likely to spend it to buy food, pay rent, care for their health and buy other essential items; it boosts the economy because they spend every dollar,” she said. Steggall said the government was “way off the mark of advice” from the Business Council, Acoss and Deloitte Access Economics. Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie told Guardian Australia on Wednesday she also supported the earlier Acoss pledge to lift the payment by $150 a fortnight, which Deloitte estimated in 2018 would cost about $3.3bn a year. “We did have an increase in the last parliament, but let’s be honest, it was inadequate,” Sharkie said, referring to the Morrison government’s $50 a fortnight increase in April 2021. Sharkie also wanted an increase to commonwealth rent assistance, and supported an independent review of the adequacy of welfare payments in general. Rents had risen “astronomically” and a rent assistance boost would also help those on the age or disability pension and parenting payments, she said. Sharkie also called for single parents to be able to claim parenting payment until their child turned 12, up from the current age of eight. “That is a very real and tangible way we can address poverty in single-parent households,” she said. Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie, who holds the seat of Clark, said he had long campaigned for jobseeker to be “increased to an amount above the poverty line” and would “take every opportunity” to push for an increase. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Queensland MP Bob Katter, who represents Kennedy, also said he’d back an increase to jobseeker, but only if a “proper” work for the dole program was created. A work for the dole program already exists, though it has been labelled punitive and ineffective by critics. Asked about Labor’s backdown on Wednedsay, Anthony Albanese noted he’d grown up with a single mother on a disability pension and knew those on benefits did it tough. He said a future Labor government would look at payment rates at every budget, but was constrained by the need to be “fiscally responsible”, citing debt levels. The Coalition also has no plans to further increase the payment. Wentworth hopeful Allegra Spender, who is challenging Liberal MP Dave Sharma in the eastern Sydney seat, did not respond by deadline. Indi MP Helen Haines has previously supported an increase but declined to comment, while Kooyong hopeful Monique Ryan, who is taking on the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, declined to give a view on the rate.",News/Australia news,Key independents say they will push next Australian government to lift jobseeker payment,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/13/key-independents-say-they-will-push-next-australian-government-to-lift-jobseeker-payment
4/13/2022,"When Esther Oni joined a boxing gym just over a year ago, she had no idea it would change her life. Being abused as a child had shattered her self-esteem and left her feeling isolated and anxious. Today, she has her sights set on boxing professionally, competing against the best in the world. “I’m a different person to the one I was before boxing,” she says. “I feel relieved, like something has left me. I feel free.” Oni was introduced to boxing when a university friend invited her to watch a women’s match. “I saw how confident the girls were, so I started reading about boxing, got a job as an administrator at EliteBox, and started training. “It was tough at first. I couldn’t walk the day after my first session but now I feel sick if I don’t train.” It soon became clear she had a talent for the sport. Encouraged by friends and her coach at EliteBox fitness gym on Victoria Island in Lagos, she now trains four times a week. Oni, 25, is one of six female boxers photographed at EliteBox by documentary photographer and film-maker Taiwo Aina. Some train for fitness and self-defence, others, like Abosede Obisanya, are professional boxers. All of them credit the sport with improving their mental health as well as their physical strength. “I used to be scared because of memories of the past,” says Oni. “Now I feel like I am the strongest of my friends. If a guy is trying to talk to us in a manner we don’t like, I am the only one that can stand up [to him]. I am the warrior among them!” Obisanya, 19, says boxing has helped her deal with anger she felt as a teenager. “Boxing is a game of discipline. Before I started boxing, I would misbehave but my coach told me that I don’t have the right to fight outside. Only in the ring.” As a photographer, Aina is drawn to “human experiences and the societal issues that affect them”, but this was the first time she had ever visited a boxing gym. The women’s experiences and the way their passion for the sport has transformed their lives resonated with her. “Even though I’m not a boxer, I understood how they felt. Whenever I have my camera, I’m more confident too,” says Aina. The most rewarding part of the project for Aina and the boxers was an exhibition of the photos at Alliance Française, which supported the project. “All the female boxers came to the exhibition and brought their families too,” says Aina. Oni says that seeing the smile on her mother’s face when she saw the photos at the exhibition was a moment to cherish. “My mum is proud of me now, but at first she was against [the idea of me boxing]. She said I would turn myself into a man, and no one wants to marry a woman like that. But her words made me want to box even more. “When I saw the photos, I knew boxing would take me a long way, and I knew I made the right decision choosing it.” Sign up for Her Stage to hear directly from incredible women in the developing world on the issues that matter to them, delivered to your inbox monthly:",News/Global development,‘I’m a warrior now’: how boxing is transforming the lives of young Nigerian women,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/13/boxing-young-nigerian-women-photography
4/13/2022,"Hello, Warren Murray bringing you this penultimate Guardian morning briefing before the switch to a new format. Boris Johnson has defied calls for him to quit after he was given a fixed-penalty notice for breaking his own Covid laws by attending a party for his birthday in No 10. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, and Johnson’s wife, Carrie, were also penalised for attending the gathering on 19 June 2020 in the cabinet room, with the Metropolitan police saying more than 50 have been issued. All three said they had paid their notices on Tuesday. Johnson and Sunak are thought to be the first sitting prime minister and chancellor to be criminally sanctioned. In a statement from Chequers, Johnson said he “humbly accepted” he had broken the rules, but also claimed the birthday gathering lasted less than 10 minutes and it “did not occur” to him it was wrong. He claimed he had spoken “in good faith” in the House of Commons when he said all rules were followed in Downing Street. Sunak gave an “unreserved apology” for attending the gathering, saying he deeply regretted “the frustration and anger caused” and confirming the £50 penalty had been paid. For him, the sanction follows a difficult week in which his wife’s tax affairs have come under scrutiny. Grieving relatives of Covid victims have said Johnson and Sunak cannot continue in their jobs. Jean Adamson, whose father, Aldrick, died two years ago on Friday, said that while Johnson had been attending lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street, her father “died on his own, on a cold Covid ward without anyone there to hold his hand” because she and her family had followed the rules. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said families had made “unimaginable, heart-wrenching sacrifices” during Covid and that the prime minister and chancellor had “dishonoured all of that sacrifice, dishonoured their office … Britain deserves better, they have to go”. Biden accuses Russia of genocide – Joe Biden has accused Russia of genocide in Ukraine, saying Vladimir Putin is “trying to wipe out the idea of even being Ukrainian”. “More evidence is coming out of the horrible things that the Russians have done in Ukraine,” the US president said. “We’ll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies [as genocide], but it sure seems that way to me.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called them the “true words of a true leader”. Ukrainian security services have announced the arrest of Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Ukraine, the oligarch and opposition politician Viktor Medvedchuk. Zelenskiy has proposed swapping him for Ukrainian men and women in Russian captivity. A British national in the Ukrainian army, Aiden Aslin, aka Cossackgundi on Twitter, has been forced to surrender to the Russians in Mariupol along with his unit after they ran out of food and ammunition.

US subway shootings – A manhunt was under way in New York after a gunman set off a smoke canister in a subway car and opened fire on morning rush-hour passengers, injuring more than 20. Ten people had gunshot wounds, while others suffered smoke inhalation or injuries from the panic. Police said they were searching for Frank James, 62, who was a person of interest in connection to the shooting. They said he had addresses in Philadelphia and Wisconsin. A 9mm semi-automatic handgun and extended magazines, a hatchet, a black garbage can, detonated and undetonated smoke grenades and a key to a U-Haul van were found at the scene, authorities said. Police said officers found the U-Haul van and said James had rented it in Philadelphia. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday afternoon: “We’re not letting up until we find the perpetrator.” The New York city police commissioner, Keechant Sewell, said there was no known motive.

US nukes coming back – Empty military bunkers in the UK are being upgraded to store US nuclear weapons again after 14 years, according to US defence budget documents. Hans Kristensen from the Federation of American Scientists has said he believes the site involved is at RAF Lakenheath, north-east of London. Such depots also exist in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey. The US withdrew its B61 gravity bombs from Lakenheath in 2008 when they were seen as obsolete and disarmament hopes were high. With Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and both the US and Russia upgrading their nuclear weapons, an updated B61 is being produced. The UK Ministry of Defence had no comment. The nuclear disarmament group CND said the “quiet announcement” amounted to more militarisation at a time of growing risk and would add to dangers faced by the British public. Musk sued – A Twitter shareholder is suing Elon Musk for allegedly failing to promptly disclose that he had bought a substantial stake in the company. The Tesla CEO revealed on 4 April that he had acquired a 9.2% stake in Twitter. The law requires a shareholder to notify the Securities and Exchange Commission within 10 days after surpassing a 5% stake in a company. The claim alleges that Musk passed this threshold on 14 March but did not make it public until 4 April. The lawsuit claims that in the time between passing the 5% threshold and publicly reporting, Musk was able to buy up additional shares at a deflated price, while investors who sold Twitter stock during that time lost out on gains they could have made had Musk disclosed his stake earlier, which would have driven up Twitter stock prices. Filed in a New York federal court on Tuesday, the suit seeks class action status on behalf of investors who sold Twitter stock during that time. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. First it was just a tweet – but soon it had turned into a favourite Kremlin talking point.

It was a Champions League mission that was supposed to be impossible for Chelsea, and yet it was one that they thought they had pulled off. The problem was that Real Madrid were not finished. They never are. After Chelsea’s astonishing and ultimately painful night at the Santiago Bernabéu, Thomas Tuchel said he was “super disappointed” in the referee’s handling of a crucial VAR decision. Samuel Chukwueze snatched a dramatic 88th-minute equaliser to send Villarreal through to the Champions League semi-finals at the expense of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena. The Northern Ireland manager, Kenny Shiels, blamed women for being “more emotional than men” as a reason for women’s teams conceding a second goal shortly after a first, following a heavy defeat which all but guarantees England’s qualification for the Women’s World Cup. The US government’s warning to Tyson Fury and other senior figures in boxing were to cut all ties with the Irish alleged crime boss Daniel Kinahan, whose gang was targeted with fresh sanctions and a $5m (£3.8m) bounty, should mean the sport finally listens to concerns.

The FTSE will open at a lower ebb, the futures market suggests, while the pound is exchanging at $1.301 and €1.200 just now. As might be expected, there is a polarity to the coverage in today’s papers of Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak being among those to receive a fixed-penalty notice for Partygate. “PM: I broke my own law but I refuse to go” – the two offenders mentioned above are shown side by side on the front page of the Guardian. “Led by liars & lawbreakers” says the Mirror, while the Metro goes with “No 10 partygate shame: PM and the chancellor broke law”. The Financial Times joins in: “Fines for breach of Covid law pile pressure on Johnson and Sunak”. The i has “PM refuses to quit – and faces new party fines”. The Times goes with: “Johnson refuses to quit over lockdown party fine”. “People have the right to expect better” – the Telegraph hits a conciliatory note. “PM: I’m Sorry, I Will Do Better For Britain” – mea culpa in the Express. “I’m sorry – but I have work to do” says the Sun. The Mail ramps it up with “Don’t they know there’s a war going on?” as it shrills that “Boris was there for nine minutes. Carrie less than five.” The Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday. If you are not already receiving it by email, you can sign up here.

4/13/2022,"Overseas aid reached an all-time high last year as the wealthiest countries responded to the Covid pandemic, according to preliminary figures from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). But there were concerns that the war in Ukraine will impact aid spending by members of the OECD’s development assistance committee (DAC) in 2022, as they continue to help poor countries recover from the pandemic and handle the consequences of the conflict. “While we can be proud of our efforts to date, new levels of support from aid and increased financing from all channels are urgently needed, because – for the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people – ODA [overseas development assistance] financing will continue to provide an incredibly important lifeline,” said OECD secretary general Mathias Cormann. The OECD, which had previously projected global GDP growth at 4.5% in 2022 and 3.2% in 2023, said the conflict in Ukraine could lower this by more than 1 percentage point in the first year, and raise global inflation by 2.5 points. Cormann said many poorer countries will be hit hard by higher food and commodity prices as a result of the war. “These are challenging times for the global economy, and particularly for developing countries. Collective efforts at a global level are more important and more necessary than ever.” According to figures released on Tuesday, in 2021 DAC members gave around $179bn (£137bn) in official assistance, a 4.4% increase in real terms compared with 2020. Around $18bn was spent on the response to the pandemic, including $6.3bn on 857m doses of Covid vaccines. Of that amount, $3.5bn was spent on doses “specifically purchased” for poorer countries. Around $18bn was spent on humanitarian aid in 2021, a 3.5% increase in real terms compared with 2020. Despite the overall increase in aid last year, donor states spent 0.33% of their combined gross national income (GNI) on aid, well below the 0.7% UN target. Only Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden either met or exceeded the target. The UK was the fourth largest DAC donor, giving $15.8bn, after the US, Germany and Japan, which respectively donated $42.3bn, $32bn and $17.6bn. The UK’s donation was down 21.2% due to its decision in 2020 to cut aid to 0.5% of GNI. “These figures painfully illustrate the government’s gutting of UK aid and the devastating consequences. By cutting £4.6bn to meet the shrunken budget of 0.5% of GNI, we have turned our backs on marginalised people facing conflict, poverty, disease and climate change,” said Simon Starling, director of policy of UK NGO umbrella organisation Bond. Concord, a European NGO for development, said counting vaccine donations as aid damaged credibility. “Concord has already joined civil society organisations in Europe and beyond in calling on OECD DAC members to abandon all plans to report vaccine donations as ODA,” the organisation said. “Despite this, EU donors have slashed millions from ODA budgets – to the tune of $1.8bn as a whole. From this, only $3m were specifically purchased for partner countries. Rather than building fair and equal partnerships, this practice only increases aid-inflation and undermines ODA credibility by rewarding donor countries for hoarding life-saving vaccines and donating the leftovers.” The European Network on Debt and Development (Eurodad) said if the costs of vaccines were excluded, ODA only grew by 0.6% in real terms compared to 2020. Nerea Craviotto, Eurodad’s senior policy and advocacy officer, said: “Today’s increase represents a very modest rise in terms of gross national income for all donor countries, from 0.32% of GNI in 2020 to 0.33%. This is a drop in the ocean in terms of what is needed to tackle the current wave of crises, and it falls far beneath the amount countries have committed to.”",News/Global development,"Global overseas aid climbs to all-time high, rising 4.4% in real terms – OECD",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/13/global-overseas-aid-climbs-to-all-time-high-oecd
4/13/2022,"Last Sunday saw one of the biggest protests outside Downing Street in years. It wasn’t over Ukraine, or the soaring heating bills some fear will eventually push us into social unrest, or even the growing crisis in British hospitals. It was over what should have been a small, if sensitive, legislative change improving a relative handful of lives, which has somehow been blown up into the kind of mutually destructive culture war that burns everyone it touches. And thereby hangs a tale about how not to fight the next general election, for all our sakes. This particular protest was over the government’s long-promised ban on conversion practice, a grim form of quackery involving trying to “cure” LGBT people of their orientation or identity. Threats to dump it from the forthcoming Queen’s speech triggered such a backlash in Tory ranks that a U-turn was announced within hours – but only for lesbian, gay and bisexual people. Trans people will be excluded, at least in England, pending further examination of claims that a loosely worded ban might deter therapists from properly exploring children’s reasons for questioning their gender identity. (Scotland is expected to proceed with a full ban, and Wales is examining options for doing so.) Such claims deserve to be taken seriously but they’re not new, having been raised by the Equality and Human Rights Commission this January and long before that by gender-critical campaigners. The British Medical Association, plus other professional bodies that regulate counselling, supports a full ban and ministers have repeatedly argued that any concerns could be resolved in the usual way – by careful wording when the bill is drafted. Yet Downing Street still changed its mind at the 11th hour without even consulting its own equalities ministers, shattering the already fragile trust in its intentions. The result is a flagship LGBT rights policy that has offended and distressed many LGBT people – attempts to split trans rights from gay ones are widely interpreted as an attempt to divide and conquer, leaving trans people vulnerable and isolated. A backbench rebellion is now brewing among Tory MPs who are tired of never quite knowing where they stand. Whatever happened to the new year shake-up of Downing Street that had been meant to bring order to the chaos? Even a planned summit on LGBT rights this summer – a Tory manifesto commitment designed to encourage progressive change in countries where homosexuality is still shrouded in taboos – had to be scrapped after British gay rights groups withdrew support in protest. Many are suspicious, too, of a U-turn announced on the eve of difficult local elections. As the Conservative MP for Rutland and Melton Alicia Kearns put it: “This ban isn’t some new woke frontier for politicians to weaponise in some culture war they think is vote-winning.” The government’s LGBT business champion resigned and some predicted the prime minister’s personal envoy on LGBT rights, the former Tory MP Nick Herbert, would follow. But instead he released a thoughtful, if exasperated, statement that deserves a wider hearing, calling for a cross-party independent royal commission on trans rights issues to stop them being further weaponised for political advantage. “Some may tell the government that this is a political opportunity for a wedge issue, but this would be deeply unwise,” he wrote, noting pointedly that opinion polling shows Britons are tired of ideological punch-ups over trans rights and want to see politicians respond with kindness and practical solutions. But Herbert was equally critical of what he called Stonewall’s penchant for “boycotts and shouty protests”, reflecting frustration among some Tories with a style of activism they think alienates potential allies. His conclusion is that a judge-led commission, free to go wherever the evidence takes it on issues such as teenagers transitioning or the inclusion of trans women in elite female sport, may now be Britain’s best hope of avoiding a viciously full-blown American-style culture war. Ironically, that’s what many hoped Herbert himself would do when he was appointed last May. Back then, Johnson had been convinced that aggressive culture wars were turning moderate voters off. Working alongside the openly gay equalities minister Mike Freer and then No 10 aide Henry Newman to rebuild bridges with the LGBT community, Herbert came tantalisingly close to brokering a truce; behind the scenes they had powerful backing from Carrie Johnson, a longstanding advocate of LGBT rights who delivered a rare public speech last autumn declaring her husband’s commitment to the cause. But in January, the rug was pulled out from under them. Fearing a leadership challenge after revelations of lockdown-busting parties inside Downing Street, Boris Johnson agreed to a shake-up that saw Carrie’s influence curtailed, Newman exiled, and a new team installed that is frankly uninterested in the niceties of millennial identity politics. Led by policy unit chief Andrew Griffith, chief of staff Steve Barclay and spin doctor Guto Harri, the new regime has positioned Johnson as the voice of the middle-aged bloke down the pub. Last week, he kickstarted the local election campaign by declaring that “biological males” shouldn’t be allowed to compete in women’s sport, a helpful distraction from tax rises coming into force. If it works, expect to see the same tactic, but on steroids, in a general election. Which is why some will see Herbert’s proposed royal commission as, at best, a nice idea doomed to fail; at worst, kicking things into the long grass. But where similar schemes have worked – as with Dame Mary Warnock’s 1980s inquiry into the then pioneering field of human fertilisation and embryology, sensationally portrayed by tabloids as Frankenstein science – they have defused public anxiety about the novel and unfamiliar, opening the space for bold leaps forward. Walking people methodically through complex ethical arguments takes time, but since scientific research on the impact of transitioning on athletes’ performance is still in its infancy, conclusive answers to some issues of trans inclusion are probably years away anyway. If Boris Johnson ignores the idea – although oddly it might suit him given the strange elusiveness of his own views on the subject – Keir Starmer should pick it up. For whether or not he’s right about the exact mechanism, Herbert is right about the urgency of lifting this issue above toxic party politics. He’s right that nobody wins a culture war and right that “those most harmed will be trans people who already feel stigmatised … who deserve greater kindness than today’s politics will permit”. It’s depressing to think our current political system can’t be trusted to handle this maturely. But not half as depressing as looking back in five years’ time and realising those years were wasted, doing the same thing over and over, and being surprised each time it failed.
