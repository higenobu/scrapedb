2/27/2022,"HELSINKI (AP) — Finland and Sweden have brushed off warnings from neighboring Russia that their possible joining of NATO would trigger “serious military-political consequences” from Moscow for the two countries. A statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry Friday voiced concern about what it described as efforts by the United States and some of its allies to “drag” Finland and Sweden into NATO and warned that Moscow would be forced to take retaliatory measures if they join the alliance. Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said Saturday that “we’ve heard this before.” “We don’t think that it calls for a military threat,” Haavisto said in an interview with the Finnish public broadcaster YLE. “Should Finland be NATO’s external border, it rather means that Russia would certainly take that into account in its own defense planning. I don’t see anything new as such” in the statement delivered by Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, Haavisto said. Finland has a 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) land border with Russia — the longest border shared by any European Union member state and Russia. Haavisto’s words were echoed by the Finnish President Sauli Niinisto who said on Friday that he didn’t see the statement meaning Moscow was threatening Finland militarily but rather what kind of “countersteps” Russia would take should Finland join NATO. Niinisto told Finnish media that he didn’t see Zakharova’s statement being any different from what she and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov have said before on Finland’s possible membership in NATO. He also noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the issue with a similar tone already in 2016 during his Finland visit. In Sweden, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson addressed Moscow’s statement in a joint news conference Friday with Sweden’s military commander Micael Byden. “I want to be extremely clear. It is Sweden that itself and independently decides on our security policy line,” Andersson said. Russia's statement came as Moscow’s relations with the West sank to the lowest point since the Cold War over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “It’s obvious that if Finland and Sweden join NATO, which is first of all a military organization, it will entail serious military-political consequences, which would require retaliatory steps by the Russian Federation,” Zakharova said at a news briefing Friday. Zakharova argued that while every state has a sovereign right to choose ways of ensuring its security, all members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe confirmed their adherence to the principle that the security of one state shouldn’t be achieved to the detriment of another country’s security. “We view Finland’s course for maintaining the policy of military non-alignment as an important factor contributing to stability and security in northern Europe and on the European continent as a whole,” Zakharova said, adding that “we can’t fail to see consistent efforts by NATO and some of its members, primarily the U.S., to drag Finland as well as Sweden into the alliance.” She noted an increase of NATO drills on their territories. Though not members, Finland and Sweden closely cooperate with NATO, allowing, among other things, the alliance’s troops to exercise on their soil. Helsinki and Stockholm have also substantially intensified their bilateral defense cooperation in the past years, and secured close military cooperation with the United States, Britain and neighboring NATO member Norway. —— Vladimir Isachenkov from Moscow contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the Ukraine crisis at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,"Finland, Sweden brush off Moscow's warning on joining NATO",https://news.yahoo.com/finland-sweden-brush-off-moscows-133243866.html
2/27/2022,"CNN footage shows a TOS-1 heavy flamethrower being deployed near the Ukrainian border. The TOS-1 heavy flamethrower is able to shoot thermobaric rockets. Thermobaric weapons are capable of vaporizing human bodies and crushing internal organs, say reports. Footage from inside of Russia appears to show a thermobaric rocket launcher being deployed towards the Ukrainian border, according to The Guardian. —Frederik Pleitgen (@fpleitgenCNN) February 26, 2022 The video, shared on Twitter by CNN correspondent Frederik Pleitgen, displays a TOS-1 heavy flamethrower, which can shoot thermobaric rockets mounted on a T-72 tank chassis. The footage was captured south of Belgorod, Pleitgen said, which is about 45 miles away from Kharkiv, Ukraine. The TOS-1 was first used during the Soviet war in Afghanistan, The Guardian said, and was also deployed in Chechnya and the Syrian civil war. It can launch two types of warheads — incendiary and fuel-air explosives. The latter, also called vacuum or thermobaric rockets, work by using oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion. The weapons system is extremely effective against entrenched personnel. The TOS-1A is used to clear out buildings, field fortifications and bunkers, according to Military-Today.com. They are considerably more destructive than conventional explosives. According to i News, thermobaric weapons can vaporize human bodies and crush internal organs. Western officials first publicly expressed concern that Russian President Vladimir Putin might use thermobaric bombs to seize control of Ukraine on Friday, HuffPost reported. ""My fear would be that if they don't meet the timescales and objectives, they would be indiscriminate in the use of violence,"" one Western official said, per i News. ""They don't adhere to the same principles of necessity and proportionality and the rule of law that Western forces do.""

2/27/2022,"NFL star Aaron Rodgers said he recently completed a 12-day Panchakarma cleanse for detoxification. The Ayurvedic treatment includes laxatives, strict diet, and abstaining from exercise, sex, and sugar. A dietitian said you don't need a detox to be healthy, and it may cause dehydration and digestive issues. Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, the NFL's reigning MVP, says he recently finished a 12-day cleanse involving butter, laxatives, and abstaining from sugar, sex, and alcohol. Rodgers said on the Pat McAfee Show that he completed a Panchakarma, a period of reflection meant for cleansing the mind and body. The Panchakarma is rooted in a traditional healing practice from India called Ayurvedic medicine, which promotes health and wellbeing by balancing the elements or energies with lifestyle, diet, and meditation. It is intended to ""lubricate"" and cleanse the digestive system, and should be done only with a trained practitioner, according to the Ayurvedic Institute. Rodgers said he felt a sense of gratitude after the cleanse and it helped him relieve stress. The exact process of the Panchakarma can vary, since different people are likely to have different needs based on their unique energy balance, according to the Ayurvedic Institute. However, the basic recommendations for the cleanse include drinking two ounces of warm ghee (clarified butter) in the morning and herbal laxatives at night. Practitioners eat mainly mixture of rice, mung beans, and vegetables known as kichari, cooked with more ghee and seasonings like ginger, turmeric, and coriander. Foods to avoid during the cleanse include sugar, alcohol, caffeine, drugs, dairy, and cold food or beverages, according to the Ayurvedic Institute. During the cleanse, practitioners should avoid any stimulating activities like exercise, music, television, or sex, and spend time resting and reflecting in a warm, quiet place. In some cases, the process may involve ""therapeutic vomiting,"" enemas, and bloodletting. While there may be a spiritual side to the Panchakarma, there's no evidence-based health benefit to undertaking a cleanse diet, according to Bonnie Taub-Dix, registered dietitian and the author of ""Read It Before You Eat It - Taking You from Label to Table."" ""We were given livers and kidneys to help with detox, we don't need to do something like this to make yourself healthier,"" she told Insider. One 2009 study found that, while there was no evidence of major health benefits of Panchakarma itself, the cleanse may make people feel healthier. However, Taub-Dix said there's a risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance from consistent use of laxatives and ghee, which also has a laxative effect as a concentrated form of saturated fat. Instead of undertaking a rigorous detox process, Taub-Dix would recommend most people to try small, consistent changes that balance their diet. ""Cleanses are short term practices that bring unrealistic results. The focus is to lubricate your system and push foods out, when you should be focusing on what you're putting into your body,"" she said.

2/27/2022,"A Chinese news outlet appears to have accidentally leaked its own censorship instructions in its coverage of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

According to a now-deleted Weibo post, Horizon News, which operates under China’s state-owned outlet Beijing News, said that comments and reports deemed unfavorable to Russia or favorable to the West cannot be published.

The post appears to have made rounds on Tuesday morning. Eagle-eyed users managed to take screenshots and spread them on various online platforms before the original Weibo post was deleted.

China and Russia have no formal military alliance. However, they have strengthened their economic relations in recent years, becoming main trade partners.

In September 2021, Beijing supplied Moscow with computers, heating machinery, automobile parts, telephones and electric heaters, according to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). In turn, Moscow provided crude petroleum, refined petroleum, coal briquettes, sawn wood and gas turbines.

During the opening of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that their “friendship” has “no limits” and “no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation,” according to Reuters. Additionally, Putin affirmed his opposition to Taiwan’s independence.

Russia, which launched its invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, is now facing an increasing amount of sanctions from multiple governments. But while most of the world has denounced Russia for its actions against Ukraine, China has yet to publicly denounce the transcontinental country.

“Simply put, China has to back Russia up with emotional and moral support while refraining from treading on the toes of the United States and European Union,” wrote Ming Jinwei, senior editor at China’s Xinhua News Agency, according to The Washington Post.

“In the future, China will also need Russia’s understanding and support when wrestling with America to solve the Taiwan issue once and for all,” he added.

2/27/2022,"China has declined to label Russia’s attack on Ukraine an invasion, choosing instead to equivocate with a call for “all sides” to deescalate the situation. “China is closely monitoring the latest situation. We call on all sides to exercise restraint to prevent the situation from getting out of control,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told journalists at a press conference on Thursday. Hua refused to characterize Russia’s attack as an invasion. “This is perhaps a difference between China and you Westerners. We won’t go rushing to a conclusion,” Hua said. “Regarding the definition of an invasion, I think we should go back to how to view the current situation in Ukraine. The Ukrainian issue has other very complicated historical background that has continued to today.” Following intensive aerial bombardment beginning Thursday morning local time, Russian troops invaded Ukraine from the east and from Ukraine’s northern border with Belarus, with hundreds of casualties reported on Thursday morning, although it was not immediately clear how many of the casualties were dead or wounded. Russia also conducted air assaults throughout the country, and captured the Antonov Airport 25 miles from the capital of Kyiv, CNN reported. Meanwhile, nine Chinese fighter jets entered Taiwan’s air defense zone on Thursday, according to the Taiwan Defense Ministry. While the breach was not as large as an incursion on January 23, when 39 Chinese aircraft buzzed Taiwanese air space, China’s air force has regularly flown jets into Taiwan’s air defense zone over the past several years. China views Taiwan as belonging to the mainland, while Taiwan has claimed independence. China Defense Ministry spokesperson Tan Kefei urged the U.S. to stop “interfering” on the subject of Taiwan, in comments on Thursday. “We urge the U.S. side to recognise the high sensitivity of the Taiwan issue, stop interfering in China’s internal affairs and stop playing with fire on the Taiwan issue,” Tan told reporters.
