4/13/2022,"Ihave found it almost impossible to look away from the images of the carnage unleashed by Russian troops on occupied Ukrainian towns. Overcome with numbness, I masochistically zoom in on the photos of victims, studying every face, or whatever is left of it. All I can think is: “They have done this before. They are doing it again.” The indiscriminate shelling, the looting, the evidence of rape, torture and executions, and, above all, the sense of enthusiasm with which these war crimes are being carried out are painfully familiar. In recent days, my mind has kept wandering to another photo, taken 18 years ago in Rigakhoy village in Chechnya by my mum, human rights activist Natalya Estemirova. It shows the corpses of five tiny, grey-faced children, all siblings, lined up according to height. The oldest is five years old, the youngest – twins – were not even 12 months old. The children and their mother, Maydat Tsintsayeva, were killed in a deliberate bombing by the Russians on 9 April 2004. This was one of the many unprosecuted crimes committed by the Russian army in the name of “counter-terrorism” in Chechnya. My mum hoped that these photos would alert the world to what Chechen civilians were going through, but it was to no avail. Years later it was her turn – as someone took a grainy photo of her lifeless, bullet-ridden body lying on the side of the road in the sunburned grass. Her murderers walk free. That is Russia’s legacy in Chechnya. The two wars that Russia fought against Chechnya between 1994 and 1996, and 1999 and 2009, devastated the republic and left approximately 300,000 dead and between 3,000 and 5,000 people disappeared. Chechnya today serves as a grotesque miniature of what Vladimir Putin wants to achieve in Ukraine: a declawed, subdued place with its population broken and terrorised into submission by the brutality of its regime-friendly leadership. Ramzan Kadyrov, Putin’s “little dragon”, as the late journalist Anna Politkovskaya termed him, continues to do the Kremlin’s bidding, menacing his own people and sending his men to fight in Ukraine. He is also suspected of being behind multiple killings of opponents of his regime. Before the bombing of the Mariupol maternity hospital, there was the bombing of Grozny maternity hospital, and a crowded market, which killed an estimated 100-120 people in 1999. Before Bucha and Irpin, there was Samashki, where on 7 April 1995, Russian troops carried out zachistka – a “clean-up” operation that unleashed unspeakable horrors on innocent people. Soldiers shot civilians, raped women, and set homes on fire. At least 103 were murdered on that day. And the list goes on: Novye Aldi, Katyr Yurt, Komsomolskoye – too many massacres, too many broken lives to count. This begs the question: with all of these well-documented atrocities committed by Russia, how was this allowed to happen yet again? Russia’s modus operandi in Chechnya served as something of a blueprint for the next two decades of the Kremlin’s military and political strategy, a macabre methodology for breaking the will of restive populations in pursuit of its imperial interests. In the years since, we have seen – from Tskhinval to Aleppo, from Crimea to Central African Republic – a willingness to deploy violence with impunity across the world stage. While activists such as my mother risked their lives to collect evidence of war crimes in Chechnya, pragmatic western leaders brushed them off, welcoming the influx of Russian oil, gas and money. Despite some expressions of sympathy, the issue was largely dismissed as being the “internal affairs” of the Russian state. Inside Russia, Kremlin propagandists successfully spun myths about the “genocide of Russians” in Chechnya and leveraged the global “war on terror” to dehumanise Chechens and make crimes against civilians appear justifiable. Similar propaganda tactics are now being used to paint Ukrainians as “neo-Nazis” or “Banderovites”. After the invasion of Ukraine began, many Muscovite liberals spoke of how they didn’t know how to live with themselves – although most of them seemed to have lived comfortably with their government’s actions as it butchered and terrorised its own (Muslim) population since 1994. We didn’t see such self-reflection while Russian bombs were raining down on Syrian cities, either. It’s baffling that so many are shocked by Putin’s current conduct when he has showcased his authoritarian tendencies from the start. It’s even more baffling that Russia was let off with a slap on the wrist after its illegal annexation of Crimea and allowed to host the PR coup that was the 2018 World Cup, while waging war in Donbas. Atrocities that are being committed in Ukraine by Russia are the culmination of unchecked aggression and violence that was enabled or ignored for decades. This war must only end in one way: with Ukraine’s victory. Recent rocket attacks in Kramatorsk that killed dozens of civilians who were trying to evacuate is another example of how any talk of truce coming from the Russian side is a decoy. The west must go above and beyond to help Ukraine by giving it whatever its government asks for – tanks, artillery, aircraft, sanctions. It would simply be compensation for years of indifference. As a Chechen, I am tied to the Ukrainian people through a bloody bond. A victory for them would be a victory for every victim of Putin’s regime.

4/13/2022,"“Take a deep breath in,” bellows the Iceman, Wim Hof. “And let it go. Fully in … and letting go. Get into your rhythm, fully in, letting go …” Lying on his sofa, I do what he says: a big breath in, then release, 20 more, nine more, four, here comes the last. “And stop, close your mouth, easy does it, just stay relaxed and witness. You are without air in your lungs, we will do one minute.” And we – I – do, hold my breath for a minute. “Three, two, one, fully in, squeeze it a little bit to your head, this is bringing cerebrospinal fluid to the brain, letting go. Now we go again.” So off we go again: 40 full breaths, exhale, then hold it, this time for a minute and a half. Hof says my blood chemistry is changing. I feel a bit tingly, hear a slight ringing noise, but I can do it, a minute and a half, he times it on his phone. I’ve never held my breath for that long. We do another round of breathing, then I hold it for two minutes. He says there’s more adrenaline rushing through my system than there would be if I was doing a bungee jump. “This is real science,” he says. I had put it to him that some of his claims are quite bold, and that he has his critics. We’ll come back to that. Right now I’m just focusing on my breathing. And one more time, two and a half minutes without breathing. He talks as I hold it, and says my body is bringing down inflammation. I told him I had some osteoarthritis in my hand; this will help, he says, optimistically. I also told him I’d had depression. He says this helps depression as well. “You’re dealing with the chemical residue that causes the anxiety, you are cleansing the shit. And, yes, it improves the virility as well.” I don’t think I said I had any issues with my virility, did I? I’m feeling relaxed, calm, a little bit trippy. “Yes, I always say: ‘Get high on your own supply.’” He likes a catchphrase. “A cold shower a day keeps the doctor away,” is another; and “We go, no ego.” That last one grates a little. I’m no expert but I’d say that Hof’s ego is in pretty good health. He is full of stories starring Wim Hof as the hero. My favourite is one about leading a group of people up a mountain in the Spanish Pyrenees. They got to the hut where they were spending the night; Hof realised they had forgotten to bring the food, so he went back down, made Spanish tortillas and brought them back up for the group. But still he was full of energy, so he ran on up to the top of the mountain, overtaking a mountain goat on the descent. “I think the animal respected my animalistic energy. Normally, it takes eight hours to go up and back, I did it in one hour and a quarter.” He actually out-mountain-goated a mountain goat. Anyway, ego or no, now we go, to the garden, where he has a barrel of icy water ready … Hof is a stuntman, an extreme athlete and now a wellness guru with a primetime TV show (Freeze the Fear With Wim Hof, on BBC One). He has set records for swimming under ice, for sitting in a box full of ice, for running barefoot on ice. He regularly climbs Kilimanjaro – and got a fair way up Everest – half naked. His techniques – which combine hypoxic breathing, cold water and willpower to make the Wim Hof Method or WHM – have been adopted by athletes, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and celebrities. He has trained Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, Oprah Winfrey and Orlando Bloom. Now, it seems everyone is getting involved. “One hundred million people know my methods,” he boasts. There have been 40m downloads of his Breathing Bubble audiovisual guide. It has struck a chord during the Covid pandemic, he says, because it’s about tolerating discomfort. “I want to show the world there are ways to get hold of your own physiology.” I’m spending the afternoon with him in the village of Stroe in the Netherlands, an hour from Amsterdam, where he does weekends and workshops of hypoxic breathing and ice baths. It’s a filthy day, cold and driving rain, but he comes out barefoot, in just a pair of shorts and a T-shirt, singing. He often breaks into song. At one point, he picks up one of his many guitars, this one a present from a fan who has inlaid it with ice crystals and a picture of Hof’s face. He plays and sings a song he wrote called Crazy Like a Monkey, although he’s forgotten some of the words. “Crazy like a money, yeah … fuck, yeah!” He plays well, and has a big powerful voice. Everything about Hof is big and powerful. And everywhere he goes he’s followed by his dog, Zina; he calls her “my brown shadow”. Outside, he has created a kind of Disney paradise, with pools and rocks, palms and bamboo, plastic animals, flamingos, a lifesize rhinoceros. The noise from the busy motorway on the other side of the fence is a shame. There’s a tipi and a couple of yurts where guests can stay. He used to live in the house here, now he lives in Amsterdam with his second wife, Erin, and their four-year-old son, Eden, the youngest of his six children. He prefers it in Stroe, though. “Here, I jump from the rocks, I go into icy water, I do crazy stuff, I do my splits like a ballerina. I can’t do that stuff in an Amsterdam apartment. There, I have to behave, I’m not a behaving kind of guy,” he says. “I love her to death,” he adds quickly. Erin is 29 years younger than Hof, who’s 62. She was on one of his courses, that’s how they met. Hof goes on long monologues, extolling the benefits of the WHM and generally bigging up WH. He can control his core body temperature, prevent it falling to dangerous levels of hypothermia when exposed to the cold. He says he can manage the part of his nervous system that is responsible for breathing and heart rate, as well his adrenaline, dopamine and serotonin. And that we have control over our immune systems and our anxieties, and the power to prevent illness, depression and inflammation. He does have some backup from science. In 2014, a comparative study in the Netherlands found that 12 people trained by Hof and then injected with E coli had milder flu-like symptoms than an untrained control group. A 2019 study of 13 people with spinal arthritis found a decrease in inflammation over eight weeks of breathing and cold water training. In San Francisco, Elissa Epel, a professor in the psychiatry department at the University of California, is leading a study comparing the stress-relief effects of low-intensity meditation, exercise and Hof’s breathing method. But listening to Hof, you would think the WHM was a miracle cure for pretty much everything. And when he starts talking about doctors, that many of them don’t want to heal but are “drug-pushers”, he starts to sound conspiratorial. His critics say he’s bold with his claims and he overstates what his methods can do. Wouter van Marken Lichtenbelt of Maastricht University has said Hof’s scientific vocabulary is “galimatias”, or nonsense. “With conviction, he mixes, in a nonsensical way, scientific terms as irrefutable evidence.” Of the doubters, Hof says: “They can doubt, but let them try this once before they end up in the dead end of their own prejudice.” We’re in the kitchen now. Hof offered coffee but then it was forgotten, lost in monologue. His eldest son, Enahm, drops in and re-offers, apologising for the instant coffee. His dad is a terrible cook, he says; when they were kids, he would give them pasta with tomato ketchup. Hof eats once a day, simple food, vegetables. Leeks are a favourite, with salt. Enahm, 37, along with three of his siblings, runs the business – the events, keynote speeches, website, training, merchandise. It must be fabulously profitable. “There is no problem financially now,” says Hof. “But what is important is my health and my children’s health, physical and mental, and that is not dependent on money.” It can be dangerous, people have died doing the WHM. Enahm steps in on this one. People have seen his dad’s records, diving under ice, which has nothing to do with the WHM, he says, but they relate them. “One of the most common deaths among experienced swimmers is shallow water blackout: people get over-oxygenated, pass out underwater and drown,” he says. “What happened here was people practising Wim Hof Method tried breathing techniques and then went diving, not in cold water, but in lukewarm water, and they passed out.” Hof agrees, it had nothing to do with the method. But now there are warnings all over the place, on the website, on downloads. The breathing can cause lightheadedness, loss of consciousness. It’s not meant for people who have certain medical conditions. Hof’s own life has been punctuated by near-death experiences, tragedy and epiphany. He almost didn’t make it into the world. After his identical twin brother, Andre, was born, their mother was taken to recover; no one knew there was another baby. “I almost suffocated, I came out purple,” he says. His mother, a devout Catholic, cried: “Oh God, let this child live! I will make him a missionary!” Which he kind of is, although maybe not in the way she envisioned. When Hof was seven, playing outside, he fell asleep in the snow. He became hypothermic, but was found just in time and recovered. Another time, he got very sick with a bacterial infection and nearly died. He wasn’t academic, but became interested in yoga, Hinduism, Buddhism. “I had this urge to find out deeper what is out there,” he says. He says the trauma of his birth was instrumental in making him who he is now. When he was 17, walking in Beatrixpark in Amsterdam one Sunday morning, he saw the thin layer of ice on the surface of the canal and felt the urge to take off his clothes and get in. “So that’s what I did, I followed a hunch, and it was so great, I was playing with the ice and it was such an amazing sensation which afterwards stayed with me all day long and that made me decide to go back the next day and try it again.” The Iceman was born. Hof met his first wife, Olaya, from the Basque country in Spain, while living in a squat in Amsterdam. Enahm was born, they became a family and got by on very little money. They had three more children and spent time living in a Basque village. But Olaya’s mental health was suffering. She was depressed, and spiralled downwards. “Imagine the love of your life, the mother of your children, slipping away over the years, and you can’t do anything,” he says. In the summer of 1995, Olaya kissed the children goodbye and jumped from the balcony to her death. Hof, in emotional agony, as well as facing bringing up four children himself with very little money, found some comfort in cold water, in the canyons around Pamplona. “I found that going into cold water stops whatever is going on in your mind, you’ve got to survive in cold water, it is merciless, but righteous.” It helped him heal, and he began to think it could help others heal, too. And the seeds of the Wim Hof Method were born. Does he think it might have helped Olaya, I wonder? “Me knowing what I know now? I would get her out in no time.” Now it’s my turn. Hof is going to activate my potential, he says, transcend my limits. What about igniting my awe of my body, my mind and my beautiful humanity? I want that as well (I’ve read the book, I’ve got expectations). No problem, he says. “We can do that in one afternoon.” So he gets me to lie on the sofa, and we do the breathing. And yeah, I am a little bit in awe of my body, that I can hold my breath for two and a half minutes. And afterwards, as I said, I feel lightheaded, but also strong. Before the ice bath, he asks how many press-ups I think I can do. I dunno, maybe three, it’s been a while. He gets me to take 20 more deep breaths, and then, holding the final one, I do 20 press-ups! “I love results, this is a result! See how strong!” he shouts. Zina barks. Now for the ice bath. He goes in first, lowers himself in without a wince or a whimper, up to his neck, he looks as if he belongs. He does this every year on his birthday, taking a minute for every year. He’s got 63 coming up. This time he’s in for about five minutes, while Judith, the photographer, snaps away. No hurry, Hof knows it’s a good picture. Zina licks his nose. Now my turn, here goes … Jesus! I feel the air rushing from my lungs and body tightening up, recoiling, saying: “What the actual …” But I am actually in. “Relax, big breath, who’s in control?” says Hof. “Let the body do what the body is able to do, you are so much stronger than you think, you are going to be happy, the cold is real, it’s a force, your inner power, also your neurological networks, hormones, it all works for you, let it awaken …” Not now, Wim, can I get out please? I was thinking maybe a second for every year of my life, so a little under a minute in total … He keeps me in for 90, after which I stagger out and straight into the sauna. But I do feel good – invigorated and alive. He says I’ve done well, gives me fist bump. “We are strong, happy and healthy,” he says. “Children of mother nature. But also dads and we lead by example, not just money in society but feeling a million bucks every day.” All very well, when you’ve actually got a million bucks. Twelve years ago, he was earning €7 (£5.85) an hour as a truck driver. “Now, for a keynote – which I’m not even doing any more – they give me 50,000.” How rich is Hof? How many million? “I don’t know, maybe 10,” he giggles. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my afternoon with the Iceman. Yes, he bangs on a bit, but that’s because he does passionately believe it. He’s also entertaining and funny. And extraordinary. He sat in an ice bath for one hour, 52 minutes and 42 seconds! It makes me hyperventilate just thinking about it. Am I sold? Like I said, I feel great. I’m going to try the cold showers. Maybe a bit of breathing, too. The osteoarthritis, though, plus the odd visit from the old black dog … Well, we’ll see. But I’m not holding my breath.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Can I get out now please?’: Could Wim Hof help me unleash my body’s inner power?,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/13/can-i-get-out-now-please-could-wim-hof-help-me-unleash-my-bodys-inner-power
4/13/2022,"Colombian authorities are facing growing calls to investigate a botched army raid in which at least four civilians – including a 16-year old boy, a pregnant woman, and an Indigenous leader – were killed. The raid took place early on 28 March in a remote village in the conflict-racked southern province of Putumayo. It was intended to target dissident guerrillas from the now-defunct Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) who are now involved in the cocaine trade. The mission left 11 dead, including the civilians, in circumstances that remain shrouded in mystery. Witnesses and local journalists have said that the victims’ bodies and the scene of the killings appear to have been tampered with, adding to the suspicion. Colombia’s army – which has repeatedly been accused of killing civilians – has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, characterizing the raid as a legal operation to take out violent terrorists. But human rights organisations question the official account. “We have solid evidence suggesting that at least four of the people killed were civilians,” said Juan Pappier, an investigator with Human Rights Watch, which is working on the case. “The ministry of defense’s explanation has serious inconsistencies and mistakes. A thorough, credible and impartial investigation by civilian justice authorities is urgently needed.” Pain was further piled on to a traumatized nation when Eduardo Zapateiro, the general in command of Colombia’s army, said on Monday that “it is not the first operation in which pregnant women or underage combatants fall”. Condemnation of the callous remarks was swift. “The lack of humanity of those that govern us is a Colombian disgrace,” tweeted Katherine Miranda, a councilwoman for Bogotá. “All deaths are equal, only some are more equal than others.” Many Colombians were reminded of similar remarks made by the defense minister, Diego Molano, who in March last year described child soldiers killed in an airstrike as “machines of war”. On Tuesday, calls for his resignation again surfaced on social media, while lawmakers called for a motion to censure the minister. Colombia’s army has a dark history of human rights abuses in its war against the Farc, which formally demobilised in 2016. That war, which spanned five decades, left 260,000 dead and displaced 7 million people. State-aligned paramilitaries and other leftist guerrilla groups contributed to the bloodshed. In one of the most chilling episodes of the war – known as the “false positives” scandal – the army abducted and murdered at least 6,402 civilians before dressing them in rebel fatigues and declaring them combat kills, in order to boost stats and justify US military aid. The soldiers involved were rewarded with promotions and time off. Critics say that the Colombian army’s tactics against dissident rebels in Putumayo prove the army’s atrocities are not confined to the past. “[The army believes that] any action – even if it violates human rights – is valid as long as operational results can be obtained against terrorism,” said Iván Cepeda, an opposition senator who has investigated Colombia’s military. “And that doctrine has been the source of thousands of human rights violations in Colombia, which, as can be seen, continue to be perpetrated.” As the scandal dominated news cycles in Colombia on Tuesday afternoon, President Iván Duque was in New York, addressing the United Nations security council about peace-building efforts. His claim before the council that “Colombia is a country that embraces the substantive principles of peace,” drew incredulity back home. “We can see that Duque lies to the international community while in Colombia there are very serious problems in terms of peace and human rights,” Cepeda said. “He goes to the UN to boastfully lie about his record on peace.”",News/Global development,Colombia urged to investigate botched army raid that left four civilians dead,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/13/colombia-army-raid-putumayo-investigation
4/13/2022,"When Grace Gibson-Snyder was 13, she launched an independent project in her home town of Missoula, Montana, to encourage restaurants not to use single-use plastic containers. She found that youth activism enabled her to press the adults in her life to take the climate crisis seriously. Even if she was too young to vote, she could still be heard. Three years later Gibson-Snyder upped the ante by teaming up with 15 other young people on a novel approach to climate activism: to sue the state of Montana for failing to protect their generation from irreversible harm brought by the climate crisis. Their case, Held v State of Montana, argues that state lawmakers have prioritized the business interests of the fossil fuel industry over their future. When their case is heard next February, it will be the first in a wave of youth-led climate lawsuits to successfully go to trial. Experts say a decision in favor of the 16 youth plaintiffs could have sweeping implications across the country, setting guard rails for how politicians are able to protect the interests of extractive corporations. “The world is literally burning all around them, and nothing’s being done about it,” said Nate Bellinger, a senior staff attorney with Our Children’s Trust, the non-profit law firm that is representing the youth plaintiffs. “Not only is the state not doing enough, but the state is continuing to affirmatively promote the fossil fuel industry and development.” The 16 young people, who were between the ages of two and 18 when they filed the lawsuit in March 2020, have already felt the impacts of climate change, from dangerous air quality brought by wildfires to the extreme drought that jeopardizes some of their family-owned cattle ranches. As these environmental consequences mount, young people have emerged as a leading force in the climate activism movement. In Montana in particular, the young activists face a political system that is deeply entrenched with the fossil fuel industry. Policy experts say Montana officials have shaped state laws around the financial interests of the energy companies, even while the science on the worsening consequences of climate change has been available and widely circulated. The most notable change occurred in 2011, when the legislature made it easier for fossil fuel companies to increase drilling and prevented agencies from considering how future extraction projects would contribute to climate change. The move essentially hamstrung future climate legislation by placing a gag rule on questions related to environmental impact. That same year Montana withdrew from the Western Climate Initiative, an agreement between western states and parts of Canada to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Anne Hedges, the director of policy and legislative affairs at the Montana Environmental Information Center, says that over the past 20 years the state legislature has undercut any progress that might have been made toward exploring renewable or non-extractive energy options. “[Legislators] just don’t want anything to compete with coal,” she said. “The majority is committed to continuing down the path of burning coal.” With six coalmines and four private coal plants, Montana is the sixth-largest coal producer in the US. It also has four petroleum refineries and is one of the largest consumers of oil and gas in the United States. Since 2003, Montana has received nearly $650m in disbursements from oil and gas extraction on mostly public lands, making it the eighth highest total in the country. Hedges is adamant that the contributions from fossil fuel corporations don’t just pad the campaign coffers of elected officials – they keep them in power. Over the past 20 years, oil and gas campaign contributions have totaled nearly $450,000. But members of the legislature are not the only ones assisting fossil fuel corporations despite increasingly dire climate change impacts, such as drought, shorter winter seasons and increased air pollution. For instance, in 2020 the Montana Public Service Commission, the agency tasked with supervising public utilities and pipelines, was found to have undermined smaller solar projects in the state by favoring NorthWestern energy, the state’s primary energy utility company. “I call them out of control,” Hedges says. “They are only interested in building new gas plants and holding on to the Colstrip plant [in south-east Montana] for ever.” One of the largest recipients of fossil fuel contributions is Steve Fitzpatrick, a representative from Great Falls, who pushed through contracts to keep power plants open in previous legislative sessions. Another is Barry Usher, a Republican representative from Billings, who sponsored legislation to extend funding to the state coal board and lower the tax rate of coal companies over the objections of local governments, Hedges said. Then there’s Duane Ankney, a Republican senator from Colstrip, a town of 2,500 people located in south-east Montana, who helped construct the Rosebud coalmine in the 1980s. Ankney has passed dozens of bills that offer financial and regulatory benefits to the fossil fuel extraction industry, Hedges says, even attempting to eliminate the board of environmental review in a 2017 bill that was ultimately vetoed. The legislature also approves the governor’s nominee to the state oil and gas board. “They’re there to rubber-stamp what the industry requests,” Hedges says. The voices of constituents who live near or recreate in an area slated for extraction are ignored, she adds. “It really has been limited to just people who have a financial interest in oil and gas who are allowed to be on that board.” The oil and gas industry is particularly adept at recognizing who their allies will be in state legislatures, says Matthew Goldberg, an associate research scientist at the Yale program on climate change communication at Yale University. Goldberg has studied how oil and gas corporations motivate legislators to vote against the environment, and says that fossil fuel extraction companies do not necessarily look to persuade legislators with campaign contributions and lobbying funds, but to reinforce policy positions that harm the environment. “If this is a recurring cycle, where they’re being, in a sense, rewarded for their anti-environmental votes, then you can see how that can pile up where there’s this creation of an incentive to do so over and over across election cycles,” Goldberg said. The young people hoping to break that cycle in Montana are part of a larger youth-led movement seeking to untangle the fossil fuel industry’s grip on local and state government. But so far, activists have seen uneven success. At least 17 Republican attorneys general, including Montana’s, have attempted to block an earlier and ongoing youth climate lawsuit, Juliana v United States, saying that the economic implications of a finding in favor of the plaintiffs would jeopardize state economies. The Juliana case, which was filed in 2015, may head to trial next year if a federal judge finds that the young people have legal standing. For Gibson-Snyder, who is now 18 and preparing to attend college in the fall, the case serves multiple goals – to increase government accountability, to make young people’s voices heard, and to protect the environment. “We’re just hoping that the courts will help the government fulfil their duty to protect the constitutional rights of individuals, especially the youth, including myself and our other plaintiffs,” Gibson-Snyder said.

4/13/2022,"More than 35 homebuilders have agreed to put £2bn towards fixing unsafe cladding on high-rise buildings in England identified in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster, Michael Gove, the housing secretary, has said. The move had been expected after Gove asked 53 homebuilders to contribute towards fixing buildings they have had a role in developing. More than 35 said they would commit £2bn, but that still leaves a further £3bn needed to address fire safety problems in high-rise buildings across the country. Gove said the further £3bn would be raised by an extension to the building safety levy, forcing industry to pay for the remedial work on buildings where the developer cannot be traced or forced to pay up. This will be paid by developers applying for building control approval for higher-risk residential buildings in England. Gove called on companies yet to sign up to the voluntary pledge to do so, saying they would face the consequences if they do not. The government is introducing new powers that would allow the housing secretary to block those who refuse to make the commitment from building and selling new homes. The proposed laws, announced in February under the building safety bill, are also intended to make sure leaseholders have a cap on the costs of historical building safety defects. Gove said: “Today marks a significant step towards protecting innocent leaseholders and ensuring those responsible pay to solve the crisis they helped to cause. I welcome the move by many of the largest developers to do the right thing. “But this is just the beginning. We will do whatever it takes to hold industry to account, and under our new measures there will be nowhere to hide.”",News/Society,Homebuilders agree to put £2bn towards fixing unsafe cladding on high rises in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/13/homebuilders-agree-pay-towards-fixing-unsafe-cladding-high-rises-grenfell-gove
4/13/2022,"Another P&O Ferries vessel has been detained after surveyors identified “a number of deficiencies”, casting doubt on the firm’s plans to restart the Dover-Calais route before Easter. The Spirit of Britain, which is based at Dover, has been detained by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) and will not be released until a further inspection is carried out. A spokesman for the MCA said: “We have advised P&O to invite us back once they have addressed the issues. We do not know yet when this will be.” The detention of the vessel comes as P&O planned to resume cross-Channel services between Dover and Calais for the Easter weekend. The Spirit of Britain will not be able to return until the MCA is satisfied that the ferries “fulfil the requirement of the Port State Control regime and are safe to put to sea”. The MCA is in the process of inspecting all eight of P&O Ferries’ vessels after the company sacked all 800 of its UK workforce, replacing them with cheaper foreign agency workers. The Pride of Kent – another vessel used on the Dover-Calais route – remains under detention after failing a safety inspection. The European Causeway, which runs from Cairnryan in Scotland to Larne in Northern Ireland, was detained last month over crew training concerns, but was reinspected and cleared to sail earlier this week. The Pride of Hull, which runs from the Humber port to Rotterdam, has been cleared to sail. The lack of ferries comes amid warnings of widespread travel disruption at Dover and other ports in Kent in the run-up to the Easter weekend. Last week, UK customs officials admitted they were battling to resolve an outage in a key post-Brexit IT system, with drivers complaining that the malfunction was adding to long delays for freight traffic trying to cross the Channel. Logistics UK has called for a “rapid reinstatement of full ferry capacity” before the Easter weekend to help reduce long lorry queues.",News/Business,P&O Ferries: another vessel detained after ‘deficiencies’ identified,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/13/p-and-o-ferries-another-vessel-detained-after-deficiencies-identified
4/13/2022,"Boris Johnson is “mortified” after breaking Covid rules by having had a birthday gathering in the cabinet room but is “human”, one of his cabinet ministers has said. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, was sent out to defend the prime minister after Johnson and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were fined by police. He said the prime minister was sorry but went on to minimise the event by saying Johnson had just “walked into a room” where people were gathered to wish him a happy birthday for 10 minutes. Shapps insisted Johnson acted “without malice” and did not “knowingly break laws”. The cabinet minister said he was simply meeting with other people he had seen for work purposes earlier in the day – although this contradicts reports that his interior designer Lulu Lytle, who was carrying out renovations in No 10, was also present. Johnson’s wife, Carrie, who was also present and has been fined, has apologised. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Shapps urged people to “judge him in entirety” and look to Johnson’s record on Covid, the approach to the Ukraine war and economy. When asked how it had not occurred to the prime minister that he was breaking the rules, Shapps told BBC Breakfast: “I don’t seek to say anything other than it’s deeply disappointing. Of course, it should have done. “I think in answer to your question, specifically, he will have already been in that room with the same people that day chairing crisis meetings on the world’s biggest pandemic for over 100 years. “And he walks in by surprise and into the same room to the people who wished him happy birthday on this occasion. And that’s of course the thing which breached the law, and the police have ruled on that and he has paid the fixed penalty notice of £50 and apologised.” Johnson and Sunak are believed to be the first sitting prime minister and chancellor to be criminally sanctioned. Both senior politicians were also accused of misleading parliament by previously denying they had attended parties during lockdown. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, called on both the “guilty men”, Johnson and Sunak, to resign for “dishonouring their offices”. He said Johnson had “lied repeatedly to the public” and his behaviour was a “slap in the face” to all those who had followed the rules. “They have to go,” he said. Labour and the Lib Dems backed calls for a recall of parliament to discuss the penalties but that is likely to be blocked by the government. The notices put Johnson’s leadership in renewed trouble, although allies including Nadine Dorries and Conor Burns rallied round him by issuing supportive messages. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary and a potential future leadership contender, also issued a supportive statement, saying Johnson had “apologised and taken responsibility for what happened in Downing Street”. “He and the chancellor are delivering for Britain on many fronts including on the international security crisis we face. They have my 100% backing,” she said. Some Conservative MPs previously suggested a line would be crossed by allowing a prime minister to remain in office if he was found to have broken the law. About 20-30 MPs were at one point thought to have submitted letters of no confidence in the prime minister, with 54 needed to trigger a leadership challenge. However, many of those who had previously submitted letters of no confidence – Sir Roger Gale, Andrew Bridgen, and Douglas Ross – said now was not the time to change leader given the instability caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson ‘mortified’ at Covid fine, says Grant Shapps",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/13/boris-johnson-mortified-at-covid-fine-says-grant-shapps
4/13/2022,"Sylvia Lancaster, the mother of a 20-year-old woman who was murdered for dressing as a goth in 2007, has died. Lancaster died suddenly and unexpectedly on Tuesday morning, according to a statement posted by the Sophie Lancaster Foundation on social media, a charity founded in her daughter’s memory. The charity said: “It is with great shock and disbelief that we announce that Sylvia Lancaster has passed away. “She died early this morning in Blackburn hospital. She had suffered from ill-health for the last couple of years, but her death was sudden and unexpected. Sylvia had such a powerful life force; we cannot imagine a world without her in it.” The charity added that after her daughter’s murder Lancaster “put her energy into championing people from alternative subcultures and creating educational programmes to tackle prejudice and intolerance”. Sophie Lancaster was murdered and her boyfriend, Robert Maltby, badly beaten in what a judge described as a “feral” and “savage” attack by teenagers in Lancashire in August 2007. The foundation added: “She worked tirelessly to combat the inaccurate and lazy stereotyping that all too often leads to violent prejudice and promoted a culture of celebrating difference; something that leads to safer communities for us all.” Lancaster’s death comes a few weeks after one of the murderers of her daughter was due to be released from jail, which Lancaster said she was “very disappointed” to hear. Ryan Herbert, who was 16 at time time, was jailed for life in 2008 for murdering Sophie Lancaster in a park in Lancashire and was ordered to serve a minimum of 16 years. On appeal, his sentence was reduced to 14 and a half years. However, the parole board decided in mid-March that Herbert could be released on licence. In an interview to the Guardian shortly before her death, Lancaster, speaking of her daughter’s murder and the decision for Herbert to be released from prison, said she had not been given an explanation for the decision and that she felt the views of bereaved families were often ignored by the justice system. She added: “Fourteen years ago he was given a 16-year sentence. What are they saying? Are they saying that the crime is not as important as it was then? I find that quite a difficult concept to deal with.”",News/UK news,Mother of woman murdered for dressing as a goth dies suddenly,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/13/mother-woman-murdered-dressing-as-goth-dies-suddenly-sophie-sylvia-lancaster-
4/13/2022,"The 2022 NFL draft is a little over two weeks away. It’s time to look at five of the upcoming class’s most intriguing (rather than the best) prospects. At 6ft 9in (!) and 387lb (!!) Faalele looks more like a long-lost third Clegane brother than a starting NFL tackle. In fact, there hasn’t been an NFL starter in the 21st century built as big as the Aussie. Faalele is from Melbourne, and an assistant coach for Hawaii on a scouting trip to Australia discovered him while he was rehabbing an injury at a local gym. The coach offered Faalele a scholarship on the spot. He wound up landing at Minnesota, using the Madden video game series to swat up on the rules and regulations. “I didn’t know what a first down was or anything,” Faalele told ESPN in 2018. “I didn’t know the positions or what roles they played. That was surprising.” Chatter among leaky scouts has suggested that Faalele may be too big to play tackle in the league, that he will struggle to dip and sink to wall off the league’s premier dip-and-rip pass-rushers. Can he shuffle his size-18 feet quickly enough to keep up with Von Miller off the edge? Can he step, drop, and reset to cut off Khalil Mack trying to knife inside? A team will take the bet that Faalele can, probably in the first round. He isn’t a novelty: he’s an assured pass protector who has the huge frame that could make him special. The only question now is whether the franchise that selects him is stocked up on enough XXXXXXXXL gear. Yep, that’s his shirt size and that’s eight Xs for those keeping score at home. If this was 2005, Strong would be in play to be the first name called. He is a big-armed, big-bodied quarterback who plays in the classic, dropback, Carson Palmer style. But that style is outdated in the modern NFL, where the last remaining stick-slide-climb thrower is the ever-ageless Tom Brady. The rest of the league has moved to embrace the off-script creators, players who can go and get a bucket all by themselves – with their arms or legs – when the offensive structure breaks down. And yet in a weak quarterback class, Strong remains the most gifted thrower of the bunch, a fact that should matter when a quarterback’s principal responsibility is to pass the ball. Clouding Strong’s status is a knee injury that he picked up playing basketball as a kid, one that saw him miss his senior year of high school football. The injury has continued to plague his career, forcing further surgeries in 2020 and 2021. An immobile quarterback with a sketchy knee will be a no-no for most teams, and depending on how concerned teams are about the injury he could slip all the way to day three of the draft. But there can be no doubt that in a jumbled quarterback class, taking a punt on the best pure thrower would represent the best value play for quarterback-needy franchises. The Punt God has a legitimate shot at being a day two selection. Indeed, it wouldn’t be jaw-dropping to see Araiza – a punter! – go off the board in the second round. If that seems confusing/odd/laughable (delete as applicable), think about this: In 2021 he hit 18 punts of 60-plus yards and a pair of 80-plus yarders. There have only been 10 punts of 80 yards in the entirety of college football this century. More important than the distance is Araiza’s unusual control of the ball, allowing him to pin opposing offenses deep in their own half rather than just booming the ball out the back of the endzone. That ability to flip the field – to pin opponents deep in their own half, no matter where his own offense stalls out – serves as a cheat code. It can bail out a sloppy offensive possession by turning it into a healthy defensive position. Araiza sits neatly at the intersection of crusty old Football Guys and the new wave of analytically inclined general managers. Both batches of decision-makers agree on one overriding idea: Field position really, really matters. Pro football is a game of land acquisition, played four downs at a time. So why not invest a valuable resource in a player who can boom the ball farther, higher, and with more accuracy than anyone else at his position? Born in Nigeria, Ojabo moved to Scotland in 2007 before heading to the US to attend high school. He wound up at the same school as Odafe Oweh, a first-round pick for the Baltimore Ravens in last year’s draft. Upon arriving at the school, he knocked on the door of the football coach. “Hi coach,” Ojabo said. “My name’s David Ojabo. I’m tougher, stronger, more athletic than Odafe Oweh. Do you mind if I try playing football?” From there, lift off. He had a scholarship offer before he even put a helmet on. At Michigan, he excelled as partner in crime for Aidan Hutchinson, the projected first-overall pick in the upcoming draft. Hutchinson was an effort player; Ojabo the beat-them-out-of-their-cleats, vintage, get-off-and-go rusher. Together, they were unblockable. Heading into the pre-draft process, Ojabo was projected to be a top-15 pick. An achilles injury at Michigan’s pro day has seen his stock take a hit – and served as an example of the dark side of the draft process. Ojabo is now anticipated to go in the late stages of the first round, though he could fall further if teams fear that some of the first-step quickness that made him such a tantalizing prospect has been sapped by the injury. Davis was the force behind college football’s most dominant defense last season, fueling a Georgia group that carried their team to the national championship. He followed that up with a Thanos-like performance at the scouting combine: the 341 lb Davis ran the 40-yard dash in 4.78 seconds, the fastest for any player over 330 lb at the combine since 2006; Davis later had a standing broad jump of 10ft 3in, the record for a player over 300 pounds; he tacked on a 34in vertical leap for good measure, a doubletake-worthy figure for someone of his size. But there are questions about Davis’ viability at the NFL level. He’s unlikely to be the first defensive lineman off the board. He probably won’t be the first defensive lineman selected from his own team. If we include the multi-faceted Travon Walker in the discussion, he may wind up being the third defensive lineman taken from Georgia’s all-world defensive front. When and how often will Davis play? That’s what teams are still trying to figure out. He played fewer than half of Georgia’s defensive snaps in 2021 and played only 18% of third-down snaps. “Incredible run. But why wasn’t he on the field for Georgia on third down?” a general manager told NBC’s Peter King at the combine. Of course, Davis didn’t need to play third downs at Georgia because the damage was already done on the first two downs. Getting off the field on third downs is a staple of shouty-man-on-TV analysis, but success on first downs is more predictive of long-term success. Winning the first down – forcing a negative play or creating a second-and-ten – is how defenses can keep up in the era of the chunk play offense. Track the most effective teams on first down in the league, and you’ll notice they just so happen to be the most effective defenses. Teams worried about Davis’ role on third down should instead be focused on how he can tip the scales in their favor on the most important down of all.",Sport/Sport,Punt God and a 387lb Aussie: the 2022 NFL draft’s most intriguing prospects,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/13/daniel-faalele-matt-araiza-nfl-draft-2022-prospects
4/13/2022,"The creative heroism of Terry Gilliam is saluted once again in this 20-year-anniversary rerelease of Lost in La Mancha, the documentary by Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe about Gilliam’s incredible ordeal in the late 90s in trying to make a movie version of Don Quixote: a salutary warning about the physical and mental nightmare of independent film-making. Gilliam’s leading man, veteran French star Jean Rochefort, suffered a herniated disc midway through shooting and was unable to carry on, dealing a death blow to an under-funded, over-ambitious production already traumatised by biblical floods that swept away their equipment in the Spanish desert, Nato jets overhead which ruined the soundtrack, and insurers who wouldn’t pay out on Rochefort’s illness and became the obstructive legal owners of the script by Gilliam and Tony Grisoni. When I first saw this movie, I felt that there was a kind of perfect poignancy in Gilliam’s Quixote never getting made and existing only in his head – but Gilliam proved me and all other doubters wrong by finally getting it done in 2018 with Jonathan Pryce and Adam Driver in the leading roles. If it wasn’t quite the masterpiece we hoped for, it was still an entertaining and affecting piece of work. In the years since the documentary was made, we have lost Rochefort; he died in 2017, having had a busy career after the Quixote debacle, but who probably owed his life to Quixote’s conscientious first AD, Phil Patterson, who was reluctant to force him to risk his health, and emerges as this documentary’s quiet hero. There is also veteran French producer René Cleitman, who died in 2004: seen here delivering that remarkable speech to his glum crew about “the fragility of the human being and the fragility of cinema itself”. Gilliam’s Sancho Panza Johnny Depp has seen his own reputation damaged these days but Gilliam himself, though skirmishing a bit in the culture wars, carries on. It’s a documentary that should be shown in all film schools.

4/13/2022,"“I have become sadly well acquainted with the depiction of spilt blood of late,” writes the illustrator Pete Reynolds on his cover artwork for this week’s Guardian Weekly magazine. “However, even when asked to illustrate the impact of the war beyond Ukraine – to wider Europe – it still felt necessary to put the suffering of the Ukrainian people at the heart of the image.” While Russian forces in Ukraine withdraw and regroup for what’s expected to be a new, sustained assault on the Donbas region, the focus of this week’s edition shifts to some of the war’s wider ramifications for Europe. Germany knows it must rapidly reduce its reliance on Russian gas, but the economic consequences could be enormous. Lithuania, bordered with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, is calling for a full rethink of Nato’s “tripwire” defence strategy. In Poland, now sheltering more than 2.5 million Ukrainian refugees, fears are growing over how long the welcome can be sustained. And in France, the far-right leader Marine Le Pen – a known admirer of Russian president Vladimir Putin – stands a real shot of becoming president in a runoff against Emmanuel Macron. We reflect on a pivotal election race for Europe’s future, while in the Opinion pages Jonathan Freedland wonders for how long Putin’s friends around the continent will remain silent. As the third part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s report reiterates the urgency of curbing emissions, Dorian Lynskey spends a night out with the activists of Just Stop Oil, one of the new generation of disruptive campaign groups who are trying to bridge the gap between climate awareness and action.

4/13/2022,"Across Europe, radical-right parties remain on the rise. In France, Marine Le Pen is again in the runoff for the French presidency against Emmanuel Macron. This time, polls suggest a much closer race than in the 2017 election. Just over a week ago, Viktor Orbán’s populist nationalist Fidesz party won a landslide in Hungary’s parliamentary elections. Parties of the far right not only have realistic chances of entering and leading governments in many countries, their success continues to spread across the entire continent. Even Spain and Portugal, long considered exceptional because of the absence of radical-right forces, have recently seen the emergence, respectively, of Vox and Chega. These trends have sparked debates about how to halt or even reverse the rising public support for the radical right. Party strategists and commentators have argued that mainstream parties of both left and right should engage in so-called accommodative strategies – in other words, adopting tougher policies on immigration and integration. Had mainstream parties been less progressive on migration, the argument goes, the radical right would never have been able to gain a political foothold. Turning even belatedly to more hardline policies on immigration should win voters back to the centre ground. Indeed, mainstream parties in western Europe have, over recent decades, increasingly veered to the right on immigration and integration in response to the successes of the radical right. Many view the 2019 Danish general election as a prime example of this strategy’s promise. The Social Democrats co-opted the anti-immigration agenda and the far-right Danish People’s party suffered a severe electoral defeat. However, there are several reasons why simply adopting more hardline policies will not convince voters to switch back to supporting mainstream parties. It can, as some experts warn, legitimise far right parties’ views and their political agenda. To borrow from Jean-Marie Le Pen, why would voters choose the copy when they can have the original? There are examples that suggest that fighting the far right by adopting its policies is not as promising as many assume. In Germany in 2018, the Bavarian mainstream-right CSU echoed many of the hardline immigration policies promoted by the far-right AfD. In the subsequent state elections, the CSU suffered massive vote losses while the AfD surged and secured 10.2% of the vote. In Spain, the embrace of more anti-immigration policies by mainstream-right parties Partido Popular and Ciudadanos has not stopped the ascent of Vox. And in France, despite centre-right parties’ discourse being preoccupied for decades with issues relating to national identity and migration, Marine Le Pen is now the most significant electoral force on the right. We investigated this question across 12 western European countries, drawing on data going back to the 1970s. Combining a wide range of survey data, we analysed the effect that mainstream parties’ tighter immigration policies had on the radical right’s electoral support. We also asked whether the electoral context had a bearing on far-right voting patterns. We looked, for example, at whether support for far-right parties is affected by the existence of a cordon sanitaire, or how salient the immigration issue has been on the party agenda. Based on this broad and comparative analysis, we found no support for the idea that vote shares of the radical right decline if mainstream parties on either the left or the right promote tougher policy stances on immigration and integration. If anything, the data shows that even more voters tend to defect to the radical right once the latter is a consolidated actor in the electoral arena. Overall, our findings suggest that fighting far-right parties by adopting their migration policies is at best fruitless and at worst counterproductive. By legitimising a framing that is associated with the radical right, mainstream politicians can end up contributing to its success. This undoubtedly leaves mainstream parties in a precarious position as they struggle to halt the rise of the radical right. In fact, the success of the radical right appears remarkably immune to mainstream parties’ behaviour. The lack of viable alternative strategies may explain why mainstream parties continue to play copycat. The dangers of doing so will once again be on the table in France on 24 April. After a first-round election campaign dominated by the arguments of extreme-right challenger Éric Zemmour (who is to the right of Le Pen’s National Rally), Macron will now have to fight for a return to power on the radical right’s home turf.
