3/1/2022,"Half an hour of muscle strengthening activity such as lifting weights, push-ups or heavy gardening each week could help reduce the risk of dying from any cause by as much as a fifth, according to a new global analysis of studies conducted over three decades. Health guidelines recommend muscle strengthening activities, primarily because of the benefits for musculoskeletal health. Previous research has indicated a link to a lower risk of death, but until now experts did not know what the optimal “dose” might be. To try to find out, researchers in Japan scoured databases for relevant studies that included adults without major health issues who had been monitored for at least two years. The final analysis included 16 studies, the earliest of which was published in 2012. Most were carried out in the US, with the rest from England, Scotland, Australia and Japan. The maximum monitoring period lasted 25 years. The analysis found that 30 to 60 minutes of muscle strengthening activity every week is linked to a 10% to 20% lower risk of death from all causes, and from heart disease and cancer. The results were published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. The findings were independent of aerobic exercise. But the analysis pointed to a J-shaped curve for most outcomes, with no conclusive evidence that more than an hour a week of muscle strengthening reduced the risk any further. UK physical activity guidelines say muscle strengthening activities can include carrying heavy shopping bags, yoga, pilates, tai chi, lifting weights, working with resistance bands, doing exercises that use your own body weight such as push-ups and sit-ups, heavy gardening such as digging and shovelling, wheeling a wheelchair or lifting and carrying children. It is recommended adults do strengthening activities working all the major muscle groups at least two days a week as well as doing at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity each week. The researchers found people reap the most benefits when they regularly do both. The analysis included studies with participant numbers varying from about 4,000 to 480,000, and ranged in age from 18 to 97. It showed that muscle strengthening was associated with a 10% to 17% lower risk of death from any cause, heart disease, cancer and diabetes. Researchers said the maximum risk reduction of between 10% and 20% was found at 30 to 60 minutes a week of muscle strengthening activities for death from any cause, heart disease and cancer. An L-shaped association was observed for diabetes, with a large risk reduction up to 60 minutes/week of muscle strengthening activities, after which there was a gradual tapering off. Joint analysis of muscle strengthening and aerobic activities showed the reduction in risk of death from any cause, heart disease and cancer was even greater when these two types of activities were combined: 40%, 46%, and 28% lower, respectively. The researchers acknowledged limitations to their findings, the main one of which was that data from only a few studies were pooled for each of the outcomes studied. “Given that the available data are limited, further studies – such as studies focusing on a more diverse population – are needed to increase the certainty of the evidence,” they concluded.",News/Society,"Muscle strengthening lowers risk of death from all causes, study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/28/muscle-strengthening-lowers-risk-of-death-from-all-causes-study-shows
3/1/2022,"People administering Botox or fillers will be required to have a licence under new laws after an “unacceptable” rise in reports of botched cosmetic procedures in the UK. The legislation to protect against rogue practitioners will make it an offence to perform such non-surgical work without a licence after Sajid Javid said “far too many people have been left emotionally and physically scarred” when things have gone wrong. The licensing scheme would aim to bring in consistent standards that people carrying out non-surgical cosmetic procedures must meet, as well as setting out hygiene and safety standards for premises. The health secretary recognised that most of those in the aesthetics industry “follow good practice” when it comes to patient safety but said it was time to think about the harm botched cosmetic procedures can have. “We’re doing all we can to protect patients from potential harm, but I urge anyone considering a cosmetic procedure to take the time to think about the impact on both their physical and mental health and ensure they are using a reputable, safe and qualified practitioner,” he said. Maria Caulfield, the minister for patient safety, said the spread of images online via social media has led to a rise in demand for Botox and fillers and there had been a subsequent increase in people suffering the consequences of badly performed procedures. She said: “While these can be administered safely, we are seeing an unacceptable rise in people being left physically and mentally scarred from poorly performed procedures.” The Department of Health and Social Care said an amendment to the health and care bill, due to be tabled on Tuesday, would give the health secretary the power to introduce a licensing regime for these procedures. The move follows the introduction of the Botulinum Toxin and Cosmetic Fillers (Children) Act, which came into force last October and meant people under 18 years of age would no longer be able to receive Botox and dermal lip-fillers for cosmetic reasons. Adverts – including social media, influencer advertising and traditional advertising – for cosmetic procedures that target people in that age group were also banned. The “scope and details” of the new regulations will be “determined via extensive engagement including a public consultation”, the department said. Details on the public consultation on non-surgical cosmetic procedures are expected to be set out at a later date.",Lifestyle/Life and style,UK to bring in licensing scheme for Botox and filler procedures,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/28/uk-to-bring-in-licensing-scheme-for-botox-and-filler-procedures
3/1/2022,"Boris Johnson’s nationality and borders bill has suffered four defeats in the House of Lords, including the removal of a crucial plank of the government’s immigration strategy that would have criminalised refugees who arrive in the UK through an irregular route. Clause 11 of the bill would have allowed refugees to be divided into two classes based on how they arrived in the UK. Peers voted by 204 to 126, defeating the clause by a majority of 78. If the clause had remained, people who made their own way to the UK would be given an inferior form of protection with more limited rights, compared with those who arrived through government-sanctioned routes. It meant that anyone arriving in the UK by an illegal route, such as by a small boat across the Channel, could have their claim ruled as inadmissible, receive a jail sentence of up to four years, have no recourse to public funds, and could have their family members barred from joining them. Monday was the first of three days of debate during the bill’s report stage. After that, changes made in the Lords will return to the Commons. The government could then accept the changes imposed by the Lords or challenge them. Steve Cranshaw, the policy director of Freedom from Torture, said the vote had delivered a bloody nose for the government. “The cruelty and illegality of the nationality and borders bill, for Ukrainian and other refugees, was never in doubt. This resounding victory means that even this government, a stranger to the truth and humanity, cannot avoid confronting that,” he said. Speaking against the clause, the refugee campaigner and Labour peer Lord Dubs said people fleeing Afghanistan and Ukraine “give the lie to the idea that somehow you can get here by the sort of route that the Home Office approves of”. All four defeats came at the report stage of the controversial nationality and borders bill. Peers also amended the Bill to scrap a controversial measure that would allow people to be stripped of their British citizenship without warning. The House of Lords supported by 209 votes to 173, majority 36, a move to strike the proposed power from legislation. Under existing law, deprivation of citizenship can be carried out for those people considered to pose a threat to the UK – including terrorism or war crimes – or if they obtained their citizenship fraudulently. The bill was supposed to enable citizenship to be removed without notice if it would “not be reasonably practicable”, and in the interests of national security. Maya Foa, director of the non-profit organisation Reprieve, said: “Government’s powers to strip citizenship are already the broadest in the G20. They are used disproportionately against people from ethnic minority communities. MPs must listen, and strike this discriminatory provision from the bill.” Home Office examples of where they would strip citizenship without notification include if someone is in a war zone or if informing them would reveal sensitive intelligence sources. Peers also defeated the government’s plan to stop the relatives of exiled Chagos islanders from being entitled to British citizenship. The House of Lords backed by 237 votes to 154, majority 83, a move that would allow descendants of a person born before 1983 on the Chagos Islands to register as a British overseas territories citizen and as a British citizen. Arguing the need for the amendment to the bill, Labour peer Lady Lister said it aimed to tackle the “injustice” faced by descendants of Chagossians who were evicted by the British government. She said: “Those descendants are now denied the right to register as citizens that they would have had were they still resident in their homeland. The reason they are denied that right is because they are no longer resident, but that is because they have been exiled from that homeland by the British government.”",News/World news,Lords reject clause in bill criminalising refugees who arrive by irregular route,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/lords-reject-clause-in-bill-criminalising-refugees-who-arrive-by-irregular-route
