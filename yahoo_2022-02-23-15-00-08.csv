2/23/2022,"A retired aerospace engineer believes he has uncovered the whereabouts of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370), the passenger aircraft from Malaysia that disappeared nearly eight years ago, after conducting an unofficial investigation. His findings have led to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) to order a review of search data.

The Malaysian Airlines flight shocked the world when it mysteriously “vanished,” along with the 239 people on board (227 passengers and 12 crew), while traveling to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur on March 8, 2014.

The global effort to find the Boeing 777-200ER aircraft began in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea before eventually extending to the Strait of Malacca and the Andaman Sea. The four-year search, which eventually became known as the most expensive aviation search in history for its $200 million cost, yielded no wreckage from the doomed flight.

According to retired British aerospace engineer and physicist Richard Godfrey, flight 370 could have fallen into the ocean about 1,200 miles (1,933 kilometers) west of Perth, Australia, and some 13,123 feet (4,000 meters) under the water in an area known as the “seventh arc.”

Godfrey determined the plane’s purported final destination by using Weak Signal Propagation Reporter analysis to monitor radio frequency disturbances the plane created around the world.

He pointed out the irregular patterns the aircraft made throughout its journey, such as the 360-degree turns it made over the ocean.

In an interview with “60 Minutes Australia” on Sunday, Godfrey said, “Everyone has assumed up until now there was a straight path, perhaps even on autopilot. I believe there was an active pilot for the whole flight.”

 

Godfrey said such aircraft behavior shows pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah appears to have caused the plane to go off course deliberately, supporting a theory about the pilot’s alleged involvement in the crash.

He revealed that the plane displayed an unusual holding pattern for around 20 minutes, about three hours into the flight. A pilot typically keeps the plane in the holding pattern within specified airspace, which happens when an aircraft is waiting for permission to leave or getting ready before a landing.

“He may have just simply wanted time to make up his mind, where he would go from here,” he told “60 Minutes Australia.” ""I hope that if there was any contact with Malaysian authorities that after eight years now they'd be willing to divulge that.”

He then showed 160 points pinned on a map where radio frequency signals over the Indian Ocean were purportedly disturbed by MH370.

In a statement, the ATSB wrote that Godfrey is a credible expert on the subject of MH370 and that it had ordered Geoscience Australia review its search data “to re-validate that no items of interest were detected” in the search area recommended by Godfrey. The Bureau concluded by saying that any further searches would be up to the Malaysian government, however.

“The ATSB acknowledges the importance of locating the aircraft to provide answers and closure to the families of those who lost loved ones,” ATSB Chief Commissioner Angus Mitchell noted. “The ATSB remains an interested observer in all efforts to find the missing aircraft.""

2/23/2022,"Inflation is making things more expensive for a lot of people. Are companies making it worse? Bernie Sanders certainly thinks so. In a tweet on Tuesday, the senator from Vermont admonished McDonald’s, Starbucks, and Amazon for raising prices at the same time they’re posting high, even record profits. https://www.twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1496180733576159232 “Maybe — just maybe — we’ve got a corporate greed problem,” Sanders wrote. By each company’s own account, inflation has caused them to raise their prices in 2022. McDonald’s said in late January that it was forced to raise its menu prices by around 6% because of the higher costs of labor, shipping, and raw beef. The fast food chain cited supply chain issues and higher wage demands as the biggest drivers behind higher prices. The coffee shop chain also announced at the beginning of February that it would be raising prices soon, its third price increase since October. Overall, restaurants in the quick-service sector raised their prices by 8% over the last year, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data. Amazon has also been unafraid to raise the prices of its products, bumping up the annual cost of its Prime subscription from $119 to $139 at the beginning of February. Sanders pointed out that McDonald’s shareholders are enjoying a 59% profit increase relative to last year, a fact revealed by the company in a financial statement at the end of January, along with annual revenue of $23.2 billion. Starbucks also recorded big profits last year. In its last quarterly earnings report, earlier this month, the company revealed that its profits had gone up 19% relative to January 2021. Amazon also announced a huge jump in profits in February: $14.3 billion, roughly double its $7.2 billion figure from a year earlier. Last November, Amazon had the most successful Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales in the company’s history, almost three months before raising its Prime subscription prices. Companies raising prices during inflation may not be exactly ethical, but it is hardly a surprising trend, and there are no legal barriers to them doing it. Businesses contend that higher costs on their end are forcing them to raise prices to stay profitable, and for some companies, this is certainly true. But in many cases, raising prices for consumers tends to leave lower-income groups further behind. “Sometimes we talk about inflation like we care about it for its own sake. We really care about inflation because we care about the way it affects people,” Rakeen Mabud, chief economist for the economic activist group Groundwork Collaborative, recently told Fortune’s Megan Leonhardt. “These price hikes are really, really hitting vulnerable people hard.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Business/Fortune,"Bernie Sanders rips McDonald’s, Starbucks, and Amazon for ‘corporate greed’ as they post huge profits and price hikes",https://news.yahoo.com/bernie-sanders-rips-mcdonald-starbucks-221358907.html

2/23/2022,"PALM SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) — A 61-year-old Florida woman is accused of stabbing her physically disabled husband more than 140 times and hitting him on the head with a meat cleaver to make sure he was dead. Joan Burke was arrested Sunday and charged with first-degree murder, according to Palm Springs police. No motive was announced. Melvin Weller's stepson found his body in a pool of blood on the couple's kitchen floor on Feb. 11. A bloody knife and meat cleaver were in the sink and blood was splattered throughout the room, a police report said. Burke was found in a bedroom with cuts to both of her palms, news outlets reported. “It is very common for the offender to have lacerations to the palm of one or both hands when he or she stabs another person,” the police report said. The medical examiner's report said Weller had stab wounds all over his body. A lawyer for Burke was not listed in records of her booking into the Palm Beach County Jail. “He was always pretty friendly if he passed by, and if me and my dad were outside he would just wave to us,” Isabella Jaramillo told WPTV. “It’s crazy to think that somebody could do that to somebody else.”",U.S./Associated Press,Woman accused of stabbing husband 140 times in Florida home,https://news.yahoo.com/woman-accused-stabbing-husband-140-122106687.html
