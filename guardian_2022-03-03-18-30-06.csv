3/3/2022,"The London Stock Exchange has suspended trading in 27 companies with strong links to Russia, including energy and banking giants Gazprom and Sberbank. The LSE said it was moving to block trading in the companies, which also include EN+, Lukoil and Polyus, with immediate effect “in light of market conditions, and in order to maintain orderly markets”. International pressure is taking an increasing toll on Russian businesses, while the invasion of Ukraine is also disrupting those with operations in the region, with miners Evraz, in which Roman Abramovich owns a 29% stake, and Polymetal dropping out of the FTSE 100 in its quarterly review as their market values have plummeted. On Friday, the LSE suspended VTB Capital, a subsidiary of Russia’s second-largest bank VTB, from trading. Earlier this week, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) suspended trading in the bank’s global depository receipts on the LSE, where it has a secondary listing. Its main listing is in Moscow. On Wednesday, Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, announced it was pulling out of the European market, after it said it faced large outflows of cash in the region as well as threats to the safety of its employees and branches. The announcement came only hours after the European Central Bank ordered the closure of Sberbank Europe, warning that the business could fail following a run on deposits because of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The LSE, which said that its own operations in Russia and Ukraine account for less than 1% of total income, added that it would “continue to keep this situation under review”. LSE reported an almost doubling of pre-tax profits from £492m in pandemic-hit 2020 to £987m last year.

3/3/2022,"In a tattered cardboard box in Mateo Sobode Chiqueno’s home, hundreds of plastic cassette cases contain four decades of memories. “Here in my house, I have more than 1,000 cassettes of Ayoreo histories and songs,” says Chiqueno, who keeps them alongside his tape recorder at his wooden shack in Campo Loro, Paraguay. Many of the voices belong to people who are dead. Chiqueno began compiling his interviews with the Ayoreo, hunter-gatherers of the Chaco Forest, in 1979, after seeing missionaries using tape recorders to document their experiences. His tapes partially preserve a fast-disappearing culture. The Ayoreo were victims of Catholic and Evangelical missionaries of the 1940s who sought them out and brought them to settlements like Campo Loro. Since the 1980s, cattle ranchers have bulldozed and burned about a fifth of the Chaco and, today, the Ayoreo number about 5,000, with barely a dozen small family groups still living in the forest. “I’m an old man now. I don’t know how many more years I’ll live,” says Chiqueno, who was brought out of the forest as a child, both his parents dying soon afterwards. “The work will remain, in our future as Ayoreo … the work I’m doing is for our grandchildren, our children, so they can find the cassettes and all the messages of the Ayoreo who died many years ago.” Chiqueno’s lifelong project is now the subject of a film directed by Arami Ullón, Nothing but the Sun, which documents his gently probing conversations. It has won multiple awards, including best feature documentary at Canada’s Lunenburg Doc Fest, the documentary prize at Cinélatino Rencontres de Toulouse and been nominated for a prestigious IDA documentary award. It was Paraguay’s submission for this year’s Oscars (though it didn’t make the shortlist) and has been declared of national cultural, educational and historical interest by Paraguay’s senate. Speaking from her home in Switzerland, Ullón praises Chiqueno’s qualities as an interviewer, describing his emotional encounter with José, the Ayoreo man who captured Chiqueno and his family to take them to the missionaries. The conversation, she says, “is one full of respect and understanding” for how the Ayoreo differently responded to the “trauma of contact”. The tapes touch on subjects such as the Ayoreo worship of the sun, known as Yoquimamito, and how they climb trees to better hear him. They also contain vital ancestral knowledge, such as how the roots of the chicoi plant contain water – a godsend in drought, but now often inaccessible behind the barbed wire of private property. One elderly man, Tune, recalls how he and his wife first glimpsed white men on horseback and ran, terrified, in different directions through the undergrowth. “We never saw each other again,” he says. In another tape, a former shaman, who has since adopted Christianity after pressure from her daughters, sings about an encounter with a spirit who warned of future calamities for the Ayoreo. A recurring topic for Chiqueno is how Ayoreo families were often tricked or forced into leaving the forest. Revisiting this distressing period means overcoming the shame and silence enforced by their missionary captors. “It’s like it were a muzzle,” he says. The recordings are being digitised by Iniciativa Amotocodie, a Paraguayan conservation organisation, which works with the Ayoreo. “We’re about halfway there,” says Miguel Lovera, the NGO’s director. Some tapes have unravelled, but Lovera says: “It’s a long-distance race that we’re not going to abandon.” Meanwhile, international concern is growing for the fate of the Ayoreo. Last week, the first half of a new, 340-mile (550km) highway bisecting Ayoreo lands was inaugurated. The government says the road will supercharge the agribusiness sector, help integrate a remote area, and benefit local people. Critics fear it will hasten deforestation and further erode fragile native communities. A few days before the inauguration, 10 organisations representing thousands of indigenous people across Peru, Brazil, Ecuador and Colombia issued an appeal for Paraguay’s government and international bodies to prevent the “genocide” of the Ayoreo, who still live in the wild. “For years the Paraguayan authorities have stood by and watched as the Ayoreo’s priceless forest goes up in smoke,” says Teresa Mayo at Survival International. Paraguay’s government and business elite, Chiqueno says, should “respect the territory of the Ayoreo who are still in the forest and let them live how they want to live. Because they are human beings, too.” The suffering and illness endured in the mission settlements, captured in Chiqueno’s recordings, should serve as a warning. “They [the Ayoreo in the forest] live better than us,” he says. In the documentary, Chiqueno’s wife, Dojae Tona Picanere, says: “Some people don’t accept what you do.” Later on, however, she says: “But I like it because it comforts you.

3/3/2022,"Edinson Cavani is set to leave Manchester United when his contract expires this summer and the striker’s preferred option would be to join a club in Spain. The 35-year-old Uruguayan has played in Italy, France and England and wants to experience another of Europe’s major leagues. Cavani has received approaches, including from La Liga clubs. Cavani joined United from Paris Saint-Germain in October 2020 and signed a one-year contract extension last May after scoring 15 goals in his first season. He talked then about achieving “special things” this season but the campaign has not unfolded as he or the club had hoped. United have been off the pace in domestic competitions – they remain in contention in the Champions League – and Cavani has been restricted by injuries to 15 appearances, scoring twice. He has not played for almost a month because of a groin strain. There have been rumours that Cavani could join River Plate because the Argentinian club will need a replacement for Julián Álvarez, who is joining Manchester City, but that is not where he sees his future.",Sport/Football,Edinson Cavani set for Manchester United exit and targets La Liga move,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/03/edinson-cavani-set-for-manchester-united-exit-and-targets-la-liga-move
3/3/2022,"Idon’t like co-operative gaming. I am too much of a control freak to let another player screw up my good work. But I really wanted to try It Takes Two because, first, it was in every single top games of 2021 list and, second, the game is about a couple on the verge of divorce who must find a way to work together. And a little over a year ago, my wife and I were in the same situation. In It Takes Two, the spouses become tiny dolls who must work their way through their suddenly gigantic house, solving puzzles to reunite with their weeping daughter. In real life, we did family therapy. Family therapy is great. Everyone sits in a room and says how bad their life is because of Dad. In our case, they were right. I had switched roles with my wife to become the worst stay-at-home parent ever. Stay-at-home parents are the ones who have to problem-solve. I am quick at solving problems but even quicker to get cross when people don’t accept the solution I offer. One therapist said it could be Asperger’s. Another said it was inherited Scottish Dad DNA: we like to shout problems into submission. Others closer to me suggested I was just arrogant. There is no grey area with me. Things are black or white, right or wrong. This is why I like platform games: there is only one solution. I remember playing Manic Miner at 10 years old, and I would just see the path and timing of jumps appear, like pure maths in A Beautiful Mind. But trying to explain that to someone else is a nightmare. Family therapy made me realise all this and made me a better person, I thought. What better way to prove that than by playing this game with Phoebe, a black belt at Crash Bandicoot? For me, the most challenging thing about the first couple of levels was the world’s most irritating character, a talking book. Don’t ask. For my wife, the only thing more irritating than this patronising, monologuing self-help guide was me. Early in the game a broken hammer asks for help because the wife in the game, May, has been neglecting the tools. “That’s the same problem as our marriage,” I chirped. “If only you’d pay more attention to my tool.” GamesMaster fans found my shtick hilarious on TV for six seasons in the 90s but my wife has had to suffer this childishness for 26 years. Cracks appear when the game morphs from a platformer into a homage to other video game genres. As good as my wife is at platform games, she cannot aim a gun. She has never played top-down RPGs such as Diablo, and crashes around like Leroy Jenkins while I sit back and calculate the best path. We started falling into old roles, with me barking things such as: “Three red rings. Beetle coming for you. One red. Hole filled with sap!” This was fine when Phoebe used her elite platform game skills to react accordingly but when that didn’t happen, the anger started to emerge. Anger is the fuel for all platformers. It’s the flipside to the joy. That one linear solution makes it the most frustrating of all game genres when your fingers don’t do what the brain tells them to. Especially if, in my wife’s case, that brain is 54 years old, has already done a full day’s proper job and would rather have a glass of wine and a bath. The levels got harder. She grew more tired. I grew more determined. “I need to go to bed, I’ve got to be at the shop for eight tomorrow morning,” she said. “But we need to complete this game so I can write about it!” I replied, a sheen of sweat on my face and the look of a zealot in my eyes. We reached a level inside a clock tower which required me to reverse time, so that platforms would appear and disappear while my wife jumped across them. She kept missing a particular leap. I ran the gamut of passive-aggressive sharp intakes of breath, then proceeded to tell her exactly what she should be doing. It only took one slip off a swinging rope to make me crack. The inside of my brain exploded like an open can of Irn-Bru thrown into a moving car. “Oh my giddy aunt, how am I ever going to show Guardian readers how great my marriage is if you keep messing up It Takes Two for me?” (NB. This is translated from the original Scottish Dad words.) I had reverted to the control freak I used to be. Because of a game. My wife gave me a look of utter disdain and left the room. I sat there for a while. Then I put the pad down, stood up, pulled the lead out of the back of the Xbox and went upstairs to apologise. As admirable as It Takes Two is in trying to show a version of marriage therapy, it doesn’t feature the truly horrible, heartbreaking, crushing-pressure stuff you have to deal with in real marriages: chronic child illnesses, job losses, emigration, addiction, mental health problems, making sure the kids have equally valuable Christmas gifts. It was ironic that having worked through all of those, I was now getting angry at my wife because we couldn’t lure mechanical beetles into cartoon sap traps. I think we’ll stick to playing Wordle together over morning coffee.",Arts/Games,Can a video game be as good for my marriage as family therapy?

3/3/2022,"There are two stories in this novel, but each one has been cut up, and the two sets of fragments shuffled together. They form a composite picture as frustrating, and as full of brilliant moments of illumination, as those church windows where conservators have reassembled the shards left behind by iconoclasts’ cudgels, making a collage of unrelated pieces. Here a saint’s hands reaching out in blessing; there the leering grimace of a snouted devil; a scattering of pieces of drapery lovingly executed; everywhere glimpses of sky, of dirt, of bright colour. Spanish author Elena Medel is a poet, and she has a poet’s preference for the significant moment over the sustained narrative. In her first novel, she gives us vignettes of two women, each of whom moves to Madrid in search of a new start. María is Alicia’s grandmother, but they don’t know each other. In the final section they will meet, unknowingly, during the 2018 women’s strike, only to pass on by. Their lives echo each other – both of them abandoning ambition, worn down by exhausting menial jobs, both making do emotionally with mediocre men – but they are also opposites. María is “un coeur simple” – undemanding, kind, patient. Alicia is spiteful, guarded, driven by contempt for others and for herself. María’s story is a feminist parable: blameless girl, seduced and exploited, eventually finds self-respect in middle age as the co-founder of a women’s group. Alicia’s story is darker – an overprivileged girl gets a horrific comeuppance and shuts down emotionally, choosing numbing work over anything that might reawaken her clever, angry mind, and refusing love in favour of promiscuous sex. Their interleaved stories are told in a variety of unreliable voices, and out of chronological order. We know that as an adult Alicia dreams every night about a suspended body, swaying horribly, long before we discover that her father hanged himself, and even longer before we hear that Alicia herself – newly arrived at secondary school – was hung up by an ankle from a roof beam in the gym by children who hated her for her arrogance. Time pleats and folds back on itself. We see both women putting up with their men’s weaknesses before we see them meeting those men. We learn only obliquely, and in jumbled order, the life story of the intermediate woman – Carmen, who is María’s daughter and Alicia’s mother, and has been left behind by them both. The effect of this fragmentation is to make of these individual women’s lives a collective picture of working-class Spanish womanhood. With light touches Medel conveys gradual but tremendous change. Alicia’s great uncle remembers when their neighbourhood in Córdoba had no sewers. Two women discuss office-cleaning jobs and voting for communism as they queue up to pee in a bar’s single toilet. The spread of Madrid’s public transport system is felt vividly, not from the city-planning point of view, but in the aching feet and backs of women travelling after a late shift, on buses that deposit them a long way from home, with a frightening walk still to be done along ill-lit streets with too many dark doorways. The book works best as a sequence of short stories. The passages when Medel carries us swiftly through the years become muzzy, but when she slows down and tightens her focus particular incidents shine out. The old woman María cares for wants to wear a special dress for her saint’s day. Their relationship is described with a delicate appreciation of its complexity – the pathos, the tedium, the tenderness and the exasperation. Finally buttoned into her red dress, the old woman dies. General Franco has died too, and is lying in state. Everyone has gone to see him; eventually María finds another servant to help her. The two women identify themselves by the names and addresses of their employers: “I’m Doña Sisi’s girl from the 3rd floor.” Entrusted with the management of life and death, they are still of too little account, even to themselves, to merit proper introduction. This is a book that evades glib summary. It is about poverty, but Alicia’s nature is distorted by being comparatively rich. It is about feminism, but the two most saintly characters are men: María’s brother Chico, bringing up the baby she cannot afford to keep, sacrificing his own hopes of college and a teaching career; her lover Pedro, spoiling his chances with her by being so steadily good to his helpless old parents and mentally ill brother. Like the society it describes, Medel’s novel is harsh. It is sometimes confusing. It lapses into generalisations about sexual politics or capitalism. But like that smashed and remade stained-glass window, it has a boldly ingenious structure and flashes of beauty.  Lucy Hughes-Hallett’s story collection Fabulous is published by 4th Estate.

3/3/2022,"Furious rank and file members of the New South Wales Liberal party are marshalling against federal intervention to override branch preselections and impose candidates in eight prize federal seats, a move that will almost certainly see the party plunged into legal action. “They’ve carpet bombed the entire division” said one member of the NSW state executive. “It’s disgusting.” The federal executive is due to meet on Friday morning when it is expected to endorse candidates for Warringah, Hughes, Dobell, Parramatta, Greenway and Eden-Monaro as well as re-endorsing three sitting MPs: Sussan Ley in Farrer, Alex Hawke in Mitchell and Trent Zimmerman in North Sydney. Under the NSW Liberal party’s constitution, candidates are now to be chosen by plebiscites in which all branch members can participate. The federal executive is expected use its powers of intervention to direct the NSW branch to endorse the candidates, though it could take over the functions of the branch entirely. The flashpoint for anger within the party is a deal that was stitched together by factional heavyweights and put to the state executive on Wednesday. The motion was rejected 16 to 6, with two people not voting, but that was sufficient to block the use of special powers which require 90% support. The motion specifically said it had the support of prime minister Scott Morrison, NSW premier Dominic Perrottet and the federal president of the party, John Olsen. The deal would install disability campaigner and moderate Liberal David Brady as the candidate for Warringah over the conservative Lincoln Parker, as well as management consultant Alex Dore in the seat of Hughes over state MP Melanie Gibbons. Dore does not live in Hughes and has not nominated, but is a former Young Liberal president whose uncle is the editor in chief of the Australian newspaper. Brady had nominated for the Senate but had not nominated for Warringah. The proposal also installs others into seats without branch plebiscites. The new, more democratic approach for choosing candidates in NSW was introduced into the NSW Liberal constitution in 2018. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A branch president in Tony Abbott’s former electorate of Warringah, Walter Villatora, emailed party officials vowing “a civil war in the party that will go far beyond Warringah and could derail the Morrison government’s already fragile electoral prospects”. “Warringah is the home of the democratic reform movement. And yet you are proposing to breach the party’s constitution and install a person who’s first contact with the conference will be on the basis of breaching the rules in contempt of the membership from which he will be seeking support,” Villatora said. “If this happens, the Warringah Liberal members will revolt and simply walk away,” he warned. “There will be no grassroots or donor support for an illegitimately appointed, unknown outsider. To beat the incumbent Independent [Zali Steggall] the party needs all the resources and support it can get.’” State executive member Matthew Camenzuli, has again engaged barrister Scott Robertson SC for advice about a legal challenge to the intervention, which is expected. Camenzuli successfully challenged the party’s legal advice on a separate but related matter in the supreme court earlier this week. At least two unsuccessful nominees who had hoped to go before a branch preselection are also considering legal action. A last ditch proposal to get state executive to consider branch plebiscites conducted on a truncated timetable has been stalled after the state president, Philip Ruddock, declined to circulate it to state executive. “Captains’ picks are not democracy”, NSW senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells wrote to NSW Liberal members on Wednesday night. “It is entirely unclear as to who has decided to anoint these certain candidates and by-pass the normal pre-selection process where YOU have a say,” she wrote. “What is clear is that it proposes to deny any competitive pre-selections, in circumstances where in some cases (such as Mitchell and Dobell) nominations closed more than 10 months ago,” she said.",News/Australia news,‘It’s disgusting’: NSW Liberal members irate over federal imposition of candidates in prize seats,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/its-disgusting-nsw-liberal-members-irate-over-federal-imposition-of-candidates-in-prize-seats
3/3/2022,"The last thing Krystle Henry and Matt Bridges thought they would be dealing with in the hours before the birth of their son was a complex logistical problem caused by catastrophic flooding across the state of Queensland. Roughly 24 hours before a scheduled caesarean at Brisbane’s Mater Mothers’ hospital, the family had woken up on Monday to find themselves cut off by flood waters. Though their two-year-old daughter had been thrilled at the unfolding crisis, Bridges said the water came as a shock. “The floods really snuck up on us,” he said. “There was heavy rain on Saturday night, then we went to get coffee – our last as a family of three – on Sunday morning. “We went to the bottom of the road and it was cut off. On both ends.” At first, Bridges wasn’t worried. Parts of Brisbane are prone to flash flooding but the water usually recedes when the rain eases. But on Monday the rain hadn’t eased, the water was higher and news reports made clear a catastrophe was unfolding across the state. Henry’s obstetrician suggested she head into the hospital a day early to make sure she safely made her appointment, good advice which was unfortunately easier said than done. Bridges called the State Emergency Services and the family was put on a rescue list, but were a low priority as no one’s life was immediately at risk. With emergency rescue teams spread thin, the couple hatched a plan to make their appointment. The first step involved coordinating with Bridges’ dad, who was in Brisbane. He was tasked with renting a car to get as close to Taringa – a suburb 6.8km south-west of the city – as possible. Then the question became how Henry would get to Bridges’ dad. Swimming or walking through the dirty flood water wasn’t option for the expectant mother. Driving into flood water is extremely dangerous and neither was it possible for her to climb fences. The safest option was to paddle out. When Bridges put the word out among neighbours for anyone with a boat or a watercraft to help, everyone on their block began to pull together to organise Henry a ride, and someone to look after the couple’s daughter while they sorted things out. “One of our neighbours have older grandkids, so they have toys they don’t play with any more,” Bridges said. “When we dropped my daughter at our neighbour’s place, she didn’t look at us. [She] threw up a hand, said ‘bye’ and ran off to play with the toys. She wasn’t nearly as worried as mum and dad were.” Meanwhile, one neighbour, Clare, had found another neighbour, Rob, with a motorised kayak. “I saved his name in my phone as ‘Rob Kayak’ and he saved my name as ‘Matt Pregnant’, Bridges said. “It’s amazing. All he said is he was just happy to help out.” Loaded into the kayak, Henry was ferried off to meet Rob’s dad two streets away, who then took her by car to her appointment.

While they considered alternative names such as “Royce”, the couple decided to name their son Angus. With several lives lost and people having everything they own destroyed in the floods, Bridges said the couple are deeply grateful for the kindness of their community which made their “little adventure” go without complication. “You get these baby books that you document milestones in,” Bridges said. “For the birth story, they only give you two lines.” “Krystle was joking saying we were going to need a few more lines on that book.”",News/Australia news,Woman gives birth after being rescued from Brisbane floods by neighbours and a kayak,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/woman-gives-birth-after-being-rescued-from-brisbane-floods-by-neighbours-and-a-kayak
3/3/2022,"The flood disaster in New South Wales and Queensland has prompted concerns for ground-dwelling animals that can become trapped in their habitat or swept into other environments. Wildlife hospitals are preparing for an influx of sick and injured animals, in some cases from habitats that have been hit by flood waters for the second year in a row. Echidnas, wombats and bandicoots are among the species that can become trapped by flood waters and the sustained rain can also create havoc for birds that struggle for shelter and become waterlogged. This time of year in northern NSW, echidna puggles are in their burrows and not yet ready to disperse, meaning many would have drowned, Leoni Byron-Jackson, the coordinator of Wires in Lismore, said. There had also been reports of drowned or injured bandicoots and wallaby joeys. Byron-Jackson said it would be weeks until carers had a clear picture of the effects of the devastation on local wildlife. “At the moment it’s really hard because there’s so many roads blocked off, so many landslides, that we can’t even get access to those animals, which is distressing us all,” she said. “We are doing our best to reach every animal we can or get them to vets, but the other problem is we’ve lost half our vets, they’re under water.” Byron-Jackson said while many mammals were capable of swimming they still needed to be able to find higher ground. She said services were working hard to connect sick animals with carers but that was being made more difficult with communication lines down for many. “We’ve got a little [puggle] we’re trying to transfer to me today, one that’s come out of a burrow too early and was found starving,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In Sydney, Taronga Wildlife Hospitals said it had enacted its emergency response plan to assist sick and injured wildlife, with staff working with other services and teams in the field as needed. “Heavy rainfall and storm events impact all wildlife, but are particularly challenging for birds, small mammals and young or dispersing animals,” said Libby Hall, Taronga’s wildlife rescue and rehabilitation coordinator. She said birds could be adversely affected by high winds, lowered food resources, lack of shelter and were often found cold and waterlogged, while small mammals and monotremes such as bandicoots, possums and echidnas were also vulnerable, with younger animals at increased risk. “As immediate flooding abates, wildlife in freshwater river systems such as platypus will also be vulnerable and may be in need of assistance,” she said. Hall said anyone who found injured animals should not offer them any food because this can lead to unintended harm. She said people should prioritise their own safety before approaching animals and if it was safe to offer assistance to do so with care and, if possible, protective clothing. They should then seek expert assistance from a wildlife service and if it was not possible to immediately get the animal to a hospital or carer they should keep it in a warm, quiet and dark place off the floor at home.

Ritchie said the effects of floods could be seen not just in sick or drowned animals but also in animals being moved by flood waters into areas outside of their regular habitats. “In terms of the impact, it may be less in some ways than fire because a fire in many respects can destroy all the habitat and it can take a while to recover,” he said. “In the case of flood, it’s relatively quick and if the animals can survive that flood they can repopulate an area fairly quickly.” The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on Monday issued the second part of its latest major assessment, which came with a stark warning about the increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters as a result of emissions caused by fossil fuels and other human activities. “What is concerning is that these extreme weather events, including floods, are becoming more frequent and severe with climate change,” Ritchie said. “If these floods happen more regularly, and to an extent that plants, animals and ecosystems aren’t used to, that is a problem.” For further information on how to assist sick or injured wildlife, Taronga Conservation Society has put together a list of rescue tips.",News/Australia news,‘We are doing our best’: rescuers fear for animals injured in NSW and Queensland floods,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/we-are-doing-our-best-rescuers-fear-for-animals-injured-in-nsw-and-queensland-floods
3/3/2022,"The Australian government has asked Facebook, Twitter, Google and other digital platforms to block content generated by Russian state media to curb “disinformation in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine”. Australia’s communications minister, Paul Fletcher, wrote on Thursday to Meta, which runs Facebook and Instagram, and a range of other digital platforms, asking them to take action “as a priority to suspend the dissemination on your platform[s] in Australia of content generated by Russian state media organisations”. The other recipients are Apple, TikTok, Twitter, Snap Inc, Reddit, Google and Microsoft. Fletcher cited “a significant volume of such content promoting violence, extremism and disinformation in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine”. Australia is not the first government to make the request, with the European Union’s own ban on Russian state media prompting a number of platforms to crack down on Kremlin-backed news outlets RT and Sputnik. “In light of the exceptional circumstances that are unfolding in Ukraine, and in the interests of protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Australian government asks that [your platform] takes such action in respect of content disseminated on your platform[s] in Australia,” Fletcher wrote on Thursday. “I would be grateful to receive your early advice as to the steps you have taken to achieve this outcome.” Fletcher noted that a number of platforms had taken action to block such services and content in the United States and Europe. He also pointed to the recent decisions by Australia’s Special Broadcasting Service and Foxtel to suspended the broadcast of Russia Today and NTV. “Given the current actions of the Russian government, and the lack of genuinely independent Russian media, these actions are responsible and appropriate,” the Australian minister wrote. Meta said the company was “reviewing the request from the Australian government”. “In the meantime, we will continue to label and fact check these outlets as well as prohibit ads and demonetize their accounts globally, including in Australia,” a spokesperson said. It is understood Meta wrote to Fletcher on Wednesday outlining the steps it was taking and offering to set up a meeting to discuss any concerns, but no such meeting was requested. Snap said on Wednesday its Discover content platform featured material from only verified media partners and creators “and we have never allowed Russian state media to distribute content”. Earlier this week, Google said it was blocking YouTube channels connected to RT and Sputnik across Europe. Google also said it had “removed hundreds of channels and thousands of videos” for violating community guidelines “including a number of channels engaging in coordinated deceptive practices”. The Russian embassy in Canberra was also contacted for comment. Earlier, the US state department accused the Kremlin of “a full assault on media freedom and the truth”, after Russia’s prosecutor general ordered the country’s communications authority to restrict access to the independent outlets Radio Ekho Moskvy and Dozhd TV. The Duma – Russia’s parliament – is scheduled to meet on Friday to debate a new law against “spreading disinformation about the armed forces of the Russian Federation in any military conflicts”, punishable by up to 15 years in prison. The Kremlin has attempted to defend what it calls a “special military operation” to “demilitarise” Ukraine, launched last week. Russia’s media regulator has already banned the use of the words “war”, “attack” and “invasion”. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Sunday that RT and Sputnik would “no longer be able to spread their lies to justify [Vladimir] Putin’s war and to sow division in our union”. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, had earlier branded Putin as “a thug” and called for Russia to be treated as a pariah state over the invasion. Australia was one of 141 states to vote in favour of a resolution deploring Russia’s actions at a special session of the UN general assembly late on Wednesday. Russia was joined by only four other countries – Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea – in voting against the condemnation. China and India were among 35 states to abstain. Separately, nearly 40 countries including Australia and the UK have formally referred reports of atrocities committed in Ukraine to the international criminal court (ICC). The ICC prosecutor announced on Thursday he was launching an investigation into “any past and present allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide committed on any part of the territory of Ukraine by any person”. Ukraine’s emergency services report that more than 350 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured, while hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed. The UN refugee agency estimates more than 1 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia’s invasion last week. Australia has participated in expanding rounds of international sanctions against Russia and has committed $70m to provide Ukraine with missiles and ammunition. On Wednesday, a Royal Australian Air Force Globemaster III loaded with “critical military equipment and medical supplies” left the Richmond base, northwest of Sydney, bound for Europe. Amid heightened tensions, the area outside the Russia embassy in Canberra was cordoned off for more than five hours on Thursday as police investigated the posting of suspicious packages to the diplomatic mission. Australian Capital Territory Policing said the contents of one of the packages were found to be safe, but the contents of a second package required “further analysis”. The Australian National University said on Thursday it was “suspending all ties and activities with Russian institutions, indefinitely and with immediate effect”. The ANU said it stood “in solidarity with the Ukrainian people in their defence of sovereignty and freedom” and urged institutions across Australia to condemn Putin’s “unprovoked aggression”.",News/World news,"Morrison government asks Facebook, Twitter and Google to block Russian state media ‘disinformation’",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/morrison-government-asks-facebook-twitter-and-google-to-block-russian-state-media-disinformation
