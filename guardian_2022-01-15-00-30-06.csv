1/15/2022,"Incredible, when you think about it, that the ceremonial funeral of His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh had fewer attendees than “Slacky”’s leaving do the night before. That’s showbiz, I guess. Anyway: another day, another Downing Street party dispatch from the nation with the highest Covid death toll in Europe. If only Boris Johnson’s administration could have organised a piss-up in a brewery, instead of just in No 10. I’m sure Dominic Cummings has some complex 5D game-theory analysis as to why decision-making in Whitehall was systematically loaded toward bad outcomes, but a lot of us will be developing an alternative hypothesis. Namely, do you reckon one of the reasons we did so badly was because you lot were trashed half the time? Forgive me: I forgot to use the approved euphemism. Do you reckon one of the reasons you made impaired decisions and now seem to be suffering repeated memory loss was because of “the drinking culture at No 10”? I mean, honestly. Imagine being such a mess that even JOURNALISTS reckon you drink too much.  And so to a recap of the latest. These two most recently exposed parties were both held at Downing Street on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral, during lockdown last April. Probably the most eye-catching detail reported – beyond the impromptu DJ set, the basement dancing, the suitcase of wine wheeled in, the spills and stains on the carpets – was that one of the revellers apparently broke Wilfred Johnson’s garden swing. (Incidentally, if you take a tour of Graceland, you’re told that Elvis and his chums loved to shoot in the backyard, and are shown the bullet hole in Lisa Marie Presley’s kiddie slide. Fun times.) “What happened to my swing, Daddy?” “Buck up, little chap. Some press officer whose job is issuing denials but who currently thinks he deserves a Victoria Cross for coming into the office sat on it when he was drunk. Is it wet? Probably don’t touch it if it is.” As for the rest of the-day-after-the-night-before … I was recently re-reading a bit in Tom Wolfe’s The Bonfire of the Vanities about a shame-haunted hangover, where the character has drowned his memory of the previous evening like a monstrous beast in an icy lake. And yet, the events begin returning to him. Perhaps it felt a bit like this for the Downing Street staff who attended those parties. “A ripple … The monster was heading up from the bottom of the lake! In a moment … Its filthy snout! Can’t face it –” Well quite. Oh, God, the suitcase of booze. The attempt at body popping in the basement. Breaking the kid’s swing … Can’t face it. Switch on the telly, to take the old mind off it. Oh dear. Live footage of the 94-year-old Queen sitting utterly alone at her husband’s funeral. Christ, the snout on this hangover. The filthy snout … Then again, the one thing the Downing Street staff don’t seem to have been overburdened by after these many, many parties is a sense of shame. I guess you tell yourself that while the Queen is vaguely significant, she is not in any way as significant a personage as you, a Downing Street desk johnny. It all gives new meaning to one of the slogans of Vote Leave, who famously wanted to be rule-makers, not rule-takers. After all this, I don’t think anyone could accuse them of taking their own rules. Speaking of Vote Leave, many of you will be rather bored of Cummings’s ongoing attempts to present himself as Downing Street’s Jiminy Cricket, a tireless conscience who was forever trying to do the good and noble thing while surrounded by liars and idiots. Take his announcement this week that he told the BYOB party organiser, Martin Reynolds, “in writing” that it should not happen. Yeah, not all heroes wear capes. Some send a single, arse-covering email to insulate themselves against any future trouble and then do jack shit else to stop the event, even though as the prime minister’s most senior adviser they could have taken a proper stand. Reynolds has long been expected to be moved after Sue Gray’s investigation, apparently to a Middle Eastern ambassadorship. Amazing. Is this the same Martin Reynolds who was this week reported to have regretted his BYOB email as soon as he sent it, become “panicky”, but thought he couldn’t go back on it or it would somehow be worse? Because he sounds EXACTLY the sort of guy who should be an ambassador in the Middle East. Great to hear that the British establishment will keep protecting and advancing him. Come on, what’s the worst that can happen? Meanwhile, today’s Sue Gray leak indicated that the civil servant investigating the multiple parties would find insufficient evidence of criminality. Maybe there are legal exemptions because all this took place on the Crown estate – which won’t do a whole lot for the whole stink of elitism, but it will certainly allow the Met to carry on doing absolutely nothing about any of it. As for the damage being done not merely to the Johnson administration but to the entire concept of government by consent, are these latest revelations finally going to be an end to it? Or are they not even the half of it? My guess is that there is plenty more to come out. One rumour doing the rounds of the upper echelons in Whitehall centres on a lockdown drinks event allegedly attended by several secretaries of state. Last night, even loyalist MP Andrew Bridgen called for Johnson’s resignation, apparently as disillusioned with the government as fellow Brexiteer Lord Frost. (As with communism, the problem with Brexit will always be that it has yet to be done properly.) Johnson’s staunchest defenders seem to be Priti Patel, now detested by Tory voters and beyond because of her perceived failure to get a grip on migrant boats, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, whose intellect remains very much single-breasted. Perhaps you caught him this week declaring that “HR does not apply to ministers”, and calling the leader of the Scottish Tories a “lightweight figure”. Oh dear. How did Jacob bite through his restraints? If he hadn’t been kept out of circulation for months, he might have heard that hanging on to the union was quite an important policy of his government, and perhaps not best assisted by mugging off the most senior Conservative in Scotland. Not the greatest surprise, then, to see a voter in a TV vox pop judging that “Boris has lost his moral compass”. (I love the idea that he ever had one. What would this contraption have looked like? A custom-built device where the needle pointed magnetically to the words World King Get Big Drunken Shag?) If things carry on at this rate, it won’t be long before the Conservative party decides to Build Back Borisless. For now, the most positive reading of Johnson’s situation is that he’s in the last chance saloon – but hey, at least that means there’s booze.

1/15/2022,"The government has ignored the advice of its scientific advisers to allow sugar beet farmers to deploy a banned bee-killing neonicotinoid pesticide in 2022. British Sugar has successfully applied for an exemption to permit the banned pesticide, known as Cruiser SB, to be used in England this year because of the threat to sugar beet posed by a virus transmitted by aphids.  The decision by the environment secretary, George Eustice, to allow the “emergency” use of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam came despite the Health and Safety Executive and the government’s expert committee on pesticides concluding that the requirements for an emergency authorisation had not been met, and that pollution from the pesticide would damage river life. Announcing the decision, the environment secretary said that farmers would be forbidden from growing flowering plants for 32 months after the sugar beet crop to reduce the risk to bees, but admitted: “It was not possible to rule out completely a degree of risk to bees (and this is the case even with a 32-month exclusion) from flowering plants in or near the field in the years after neonicotinoid use.” Environmental charities condemned the move as “shameful” and “a betrayal”. Sandra Bell, campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Allowing a bee-harming pesticide back into our fields is totally at odds with ministers’ so-called green ambitions, not to mention directly against the recommendation of their own scientists. This decision comes just two months after the government enshrined in law a target to halt species loss by 2030.” Stephanie Morren, senior policy officer for the RSPB, said: “As we tackle the nature and climate emergency on our doorsteps we need decision-makers to support our farmers in delivering sustainable farming. This means upholding the ban on highly toxic pesticides like neonicotinoids, and instead working to support our farmers in reducing their reliance on these harmful chemicals.” Matt Shardlow, chief executive of Buglife, said: “Neonicotinoids approved under the current pesticide approval process devastated populations of wild bees and heavily polluted rivers. It is shameful that no action has been taken to ensure that bee and wildlife destroying pesticides are properly assessed as being pollinator safe before they are approved or derogated for use.” Neonicotinoids were banned for agricultural use across the EU and Britain in 2018 due to their devastating impact on bee populations. Tiny traces of these toxic chemicals in crop pollen or wildflowers damage bees’ ability to forage and navigate. A recent scientific study found that even a single exposure to a neonicotinoid insecticide could significantly damage future generations’ ability to reproduce. The exemption for Cruiser SB was also granted in 2021 but was not needed by sugar beet farmers because modelling indicated that the yellows virus carried by aphids would pose no threat. In 2020, according to the government, the virus destroyed a quarter of the national crop. A Defra spokesperson said: “This decision has not been taken lightly and is based on robust scientific assessment. We evaluate the risks very carefully and only grant temporary emergency authorisations for restricted pesticides in special circumstances when strict requirements are met. “Last year the threshold was not met so the authorisation was never exercised. Strict criteria remain in place meaning this authorisation will only be used if necessary.”",News/Environment,UK charities condemn ‘betrayal’ of allowing bee-killing pesticide in sugar beet crops,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/14/uk-charities-condemn-betrayal-of-allowing-bee-killing-pesticide-in-sugar-beet-crops
1/15/2022,"Fashion brands that make misleading claims about their environmental credentials face a crackdown by the competition watchdog as it targets greenwashing. Brands could be forced to change the way they advertise or face court action if they are found to have breached consumer protection law with spurious environmental claims.  The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is understood to have prioritised fashion because of the size of the market and the scale of consumer concerns. Other sectors, including transport, food and drink, and beauty are also expected to be investigated over their environmental claims. Cecilia Parker Aranha, the CMA’s director of consumer protection, said: “People are becoming increasingly aware of the negative impact that fashion can have on our planet. We know many shoppers are actively looking for brands which are doing good things for the environment – and we want to make sure the claims they see are stacking up. “Our work so far indicates that there could be issues with greenwashing in the fashion sector and that is why we’ve prioritised this area for further investigation. “Now is the time for the fashion industry to take a fresh look at what they’re telling customers and make any changes needed to comply with the law. Businesses that can’t back up their claims risk action from the CMA and damage to their reputation in the long-run.” The investigation comes as the fashion industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact as some estimates indicate it is responsible for between 2% and 8% of global carbon emissions. Its thought the global industry contributes more to the climate emergency than the aeronautical and shipping industries combined and, if trends continue, it could account for a quarter of the world’s carbon budget by 2050. The growing volume of online shopping returns have also sparked concern among campaigners. The pressure group Changing Markets Foundation released a report last year into the use of synthetic fibres by 46 leading brands. It said that 60% of claims by UK and European fashion companies, including Asos, H&M and Zara, were unsubstantiated and misleading shoppers. The report particularly criticised the use of polyester made from recycled plastic bottles which it said was a “false solution” and said brands were not doing enough to ensure their clothing was recyclable. Urska Trunk, the campaign manager at Changing Markets, said: “While brands are quick to capitalise on consumer concern by using sustainability as a marketing ploy, the vast majority of such claims are all style and no substance. While they greenwash their clothing collections, they are simultaneously dragging their feet on embracing truly circular solutions, for example by not making the necessary investments to ensure a future in which clothes can be recycled back into clothes.” It picked out H&M’s ethical Conscious Collection for using more synthetics than in its main collection, with one in five items analysed found to be made from 100% fossil fuel-derived synthetic materials. H&M said it based its product sustainability claims on “credible third-party certification schemes for our materials to ensure sustainable sourcing and integrity” such as the Global Recycled Standard. The Swedish fast-fashion retailer said that polyester made up 27% of its material use, however it agreed that “recycled polyester from single-use plastic bottles shouldn’t be the long-term solution for the industry”. It said while it was investing in recycling, textile-to-textile recycling solutions are needed, hence its investment in recycling technologies, such as Worn Again, TreeToTextile and Renewcell. The CMA began looking into green claims in 2020, finding that up to 40% could be misleading to consumers. It gave companies making misleading claims about their environmental credentials until the end of last year to stop the practice, which is known as “greenwashing”. The Advertising Standards Authority has clamped down on several big companies in recent years over greenwashing adverts, including the airline Ryanair, the carmaker BMW and the oil producer Shell.",News/Business,Dirty greenwashing: watchdog targets fashion brands over misleading claims,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/14/dirty-greenwashing-watchdog-targets-fashion-brands-over-misleading-claims
1/15/2022,"My theory is that every British person has one pet peeve Americanism. Perhaps it’s the phrase “pet peeve”. Maybe it’s people saying, “Can I get a coffee?” when, “Can I have … ” makes more sense. Or maybe it’s a custom, such as tipping. I asked Professor Stefan Gössling of the School of Business and Economics at Linnaeus University in Sweden, whose study explored the impact of tipping on social welfare, whether it’s a good thing to do. Hi Stefan! Where are you?Southern Germany.  Is tipping the norm there? It is in London, and it’s creeping up from 10% to 12.5% and sometimes 15%. The other day I left 20%Germany is a tipping country; Norway and Iceland are moving away from it. I read that the Norwegian labour unions discourage tipping, saying it promotes weak wages and doesn’t count toward pensionsAnd most people tip by card there, which makes it difficult to enforce the regulation to deduct tax from tips before they’re passed on. Norway has a high minimum wage, too. And our research showed that customers prefer tipping with cash, perhaps because they see it as a tax-free gift. I can see why, although I think paying taxes is chic. What about service charges? It’s illegal for UK employers to keep tips left by card, but service charges are often used to cover costs.Well, an average restaurant makes about 5% profit. So in North America, service charges pay staff, and everyone accepts it. It’s the European model to price everything into the menu. Including a liveable salary for staff?Not always. In Spain, the rate is about €1,000 (£850) a month. Few people can live on that. In Switzerland, it’s double. And they don’t tip in Switzerland. It can’t be a coincidence that tipping isn’t customary where staff are well paid. Should ending tips be the goal?Or it can be a good wage and tipping. People like tips, it makes them feel good. But isn’t it discriminatory?Studies show that if you’re a good-looking blond woman, you’ll earn more tips. You could call that a racial bias, or a gender bias. I would call it biology: men like to impress attractive women. But knowing that means it’s easy to find mechanisms to increase tips. Everyone loves a friendly waiter. A smile is a great weapon. Doesn’t sound wholly fair, though.It’s going to be hard to find any job where your personality doesn’t make a difference. And the monetary difference between the best- and worst-performing is small. Punters rarely have the knowledge to judge performance-related pay – it’s not the waiter’s fault if the kitchen is slow. Should customers have this power?It’s only an issue of power when staff depend on tips to survive. Do you tip?Yes, about 10%. Is 10% the magic number?It’s made up, based on the country’s norms and economy. But it can change, so it’s up to us to decide how we want this system to develop. If it goes in the direction of 20% tips … Uh-oh, did I overdo it?… we could be undermining working conditions because employers won’t pay more than the minimum. Then we’re approaching the US model. As consumers, we should be aware that we might be pushing that system to exist.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Should you leave a tip?

1/15/2022,"According to reports, the England team took a charter flight to Hobart. Watching them play on the first day at the Bellerive Oval it looked more like they had travelled by ancient sailing bark, and arrived, like Abel Tasman, soiled, sore, and ship-worn, half-starved after six months picking weevils out of biscuits. Battered, cut, and bruised, suffering from strains, niggles, aches and breakdowns, a loss of form, and a lack of faith. Between the 11 of them it felt like if you cherry-picked the best bits from each they could just about cobble together one fit, functioning, and happy Test cricketer. The record books show this is the shortest Ashes tour the team have ever taken, but from the look of them, it must be starting to feel like it’s dragged on awfully long.  The brief elation they, and everyone else felt, after Joe Root had won the toss on a grassy, damp, green, and unexpectedly familiar sort of pitch and Australia fell to 12 for three, gave way pretty quickly once Marnus Labuschagne and Travis Head launched their brilliant counterattack. England started to fall apart almost as soon as Root made his first bowling change. Chris Woakes, hopelessly short of form and good-feeling after being dropped from the team, seemed to have forgotten how to do the one thing that’s always come so naturally to him, and couldn’t settle on a line, or a length. Mark Wood wasn’t doing much better. Then Ollie Robinson went off injured just after lunch, and, when he came back on again, spent the rest of the day hobbling geriatrically around the outfield, sometimes throwing the ball back underarm from the deep. With Ben Stokes unable to bowl because he came into the game carrying a side-strain, the only option Root had left was to bowl himself, which is how England ended up delivering 10 overs of part-time off-spin in conditions which were tailor-made for seam bowling. The score at stumps should have felt encouraging, but spoke, instead, of an opportunity missed, and a chance let slip. So, as the day wore on, thoughts drifted along, away from what will happen in this game to the more pressing question of what will happen when it’s all over. Fortunately, the ECB chief executive Tom Harrison was on hand to fill us in on the details. Harrison gave an interview to the BBC in which he talked through some of his ideas for the future. Have you got the appetite for more of this? Harrison hardly ever gives interviews, and yet, as soon as he does speak up, he has the odd knack of making you feel as though you’ve already heard enough. Harrison explained that we were in fact looking at this latest series defeat all wrong, and it was really “a brilliant opportunity for us to come together as a game” to “reset the importance of red-ball cricket in our domestic schedule” and “recalibrate how we play first class cricket in the UK”. This would be more convincing if Harrison hadn’t spent the last seven years in charge of the very same system he’s now blaming this failure on. It would have helped his case, too, if the single biggest impediment to that recalibration he wants wasn’t the eye-wateringly expensive white-ball tournament he launched that’s now sprawled across the middle of the summer like a doberman on a sofa. Harrison also returned to another of his recent themes, “the volume of cricket”, and again, he’s entirely right. There is too much. The question is whether he’s noticed that a large part of it is down to the fact he just launched a needless fourth format of the sport. There was another odd little irony when he spoke about the one tangible measure he has taken so far. He said that he had written to Cricket Australia asking them to help set up a system where English players could play in the Sheffield Shield (they can hardly get a game of first-class cricket in their own country, after all). More cricket, then, for the men who he says need to play less of it. There’s a grain of a good point here, too. If you looked with the right kind of eyes you could see how Labuschagne and Head have benefited from playing in English county cricket in the way they set about England’s seamers on a green pitch in Hobart. But there are only six Shield sides, and competition for places on them is pretty fierce. Good luck persuading them that they should also be helping to develop young English players. Besides which, this current England squad actually has plenty of experience in Australian conditions, whether it was in Grade cricket, or the Big Bash, or on A tours. It is one of the things the ECB have got right in the last few years. That’s before you even consider the question of where, exactly, they are going to find time for this in the schedule. All that aside, it’s a fine idea, just way down the list of things England need to fix. They should maybe wait until they broach it with the players though. If they tell this lot that they are going to have to spend any more time in Australia, they might just end up with a mutiny on their hands. Although funnily enough, listening to Harrison, you wonder if that might be exactly what English cricket needs.",Sport/Sport,England’s creaking bowling attack lets Australia off the Ashes hook | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/14/englands-threadbare-attack-fail-to-build-on-encouraging-start
1/15/2022,"Vigils are to be held in Ireland after the “senseless” killing of a 23-year-old teacher, with echoes of the national reckoning that was sparked in the UK last year by the murder of Sarah Everard. Ashling Murphy was killed on Wednesday afternoon while going for a run along the banks of the Grand Canal in Tullamore in County Offaly.  The killing has provoked an outpouring of grief on the island of Ireland and beyond, as well as anger and revulsion at another young woman allegedly murdered while going about her business in public. Irish police had arrested and detained a man but he has since been released. “This male has been eliminated from Garda inquiries and is no longer a suspect,” a Garda Síochána spokesperson told the Irish News. Police promised to leave “no stone unturned” in bringing the killer to justice. Murphy was a teacher at Durrow national school and a musician. Her father, Raymond, told the Mirror: “She was just a special girl. She’s the youngest, a little angel. She was a brilliant girl in every sense of the word.” Rallies and vigils will be staged across Ireland and the UK over the weekend, including in Dublin, Limerick, Belfast, Derry and London, with thousands expected to attend. Senior politicians expressed their alarm and solidarity. In London, a vigil will be held at the London Irish Centre in Camden Town on Saturday at 4pm. “My thoughts tonight are with the family of the young woman killed in a truly shocking crime, with her friends and with her community,” Helen McEntee, Ireland’s minister for justice, tweeted. “The gardaí will investigate this awful crime and ensure justice is done.” “The whole country is shocked and devastated at the horrific murder of … Ashling Murphy while going for a run. Her family, friends, colleagues and the children she taught are in our thoughts this morning,” Michelle O’Neill, Stormont’s deputy first minister, said on Twitter. “Violence against women and girls must be stopped.” Murphy’s mother, Kathleen, told the Mirror: “The last thing she’d say in the morning going out was ‘Mam, I love you’.” The killing follows the conviction of Wayne Couzens for the kidnap, rape and murder of Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive, as she walked home in March last year. Couzens, who at the time of the crime was a serving Metropolitan police officer, was sentenced to life in prison. Last month, Koci Selamaj accepted responsibility for the death of the 28-year-old schoolteacher Sabina Nessa in London in September. She was found dead a day after leaving her home to meet a friend in a nearby bar. Selamaj pleaded not guilty to her murder and the trial is continuing. “There must be zero tolerance for any violence against women,” Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, tweeted. “Truly devastating and senseless. Every effort is being made to make sure justice is served.” “It’s frightening that news has emerged of another woman who has been brutally murdered here on our island,” said Nichola Mallon, the SDLP’s deputy leader and Stormont’s minister for infrastructure. “This is why women right across our island don’t feel safe.”",News/World news,Ashling Murphy: vigils to be held across Ireland for teacher killed going for run,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/ashling-murphy-vigils-across-ireland-teacher-killed-going-for-run
1/15/2022,"Emmanuel Macron is facing growing political divisions over Covid rules in the run-up to the spring presidential election, after his proposed vaccine pass was delayed and teachers took strike action, amid ongoing street demonstrations and a rise in violent threats against politicians. With an increasing mood of fatigue among French voters after two years of the pandemic and a significant mistrust of the political class, the president –– who is likely to hold off declaring his re-election bid for several weeks as the coronavirus health crisis continues –– wants to be seen as reliable but firm.  France has been hit by a fifth wave of Covid infections, with more than 305,000 daily cases reported on Thursday, just as campaigning for the April presidential election was due to begin in earnest. Macron has ramped up his rhetoric against France’s minority of non-vaccinated people –– less than 10% of the population –– in part as a way of setting the political battle lines for the election. Coronavirus rules are becoming a significant issue for the campaign. The vaccine pass would harden Covid-19 restrictions, making proof of vaccination mandatory to enter certain public places including cafes, restaurants, cinemas and long-distance trains. Macron had hoped to introduce it this weekend. But the bill has been forced to a second round of parliamentary debate after lawmakers and senators failed to reach agreement. Macron’s recent, deliberately radical statement that he really wanted to dump non-vaccinated people “in the shit” by making their daily lives as difficult as possible was aimed to appeal to his own centrist electorate, which is overwhelmingly vaccinated and exasperated at the ongoing coronavirus crisis. Although France had a slow start on vaccines, it now has one of the highest rates of vaccination in Europe – at more than 90% – and a majority of people support the vaccine pass. The president is seeking to portray himself as the centrist voice of reason and science –– as previously defined by his Europe minister, Clément Beaune, who will play a leading role in his campaign –– against what he deems the dangers of populism among other candidates: Marine Le Pen and the former TV pundit Éric Zemmour on the far right, and the left’s Jean-Luc Mélenchon. None of those candidates oppose vaccination, but they have been critical of the vaccine pass. Macron’s main challenger, Valérie Pécresse of Nicolas Sarkozy’s right-wing party, Les Républicains, supports the vaccine pass but her party’s amendments and challenges in parliament and the senate have stalled it coming into force. Macron’s party blamed Les Républicains on Friday for delaying Covid protections. But Damien Abad, the head of the party in the parliament’s lower house and an advisor to Pécresse, described Macron’s comments about dumping people “in the shit” as “cold and calculating populism” aimed at “dividing the French people” for electoral purposes. There is a mood of mistrust of the political class and institutions in France, which has simmered since the gilets jaunes anti-government protests before the pandemic. Elected politicians, particularly from Macron’s party, have made more than 300 complaints to police of death threats against them since the introduction of Macron’s health pass in July 2021, which required either vaccination, recovery from coronavirus or a negative test for access to public places such as restaurants and libraries. There have been more than 60 complaints of violence against elected officials so far this month, including over the vaccine issue, the interior minister said this week. Yaël Braun-Pivet, a lawmaker from Macron’s party, received a message saying if she didn’t vote against the vaccine pass there would be a “gigantic bloodbath” in parliament. Pascal Bois, another lawmaker from Macron’s party, who had already received a bullet in the post, had his garage and car torched two weeks ago with graffiti on the walls about “voting no”. Within the minority of the roughly 5 million unvaccinated people in France, not all are anti-vaccine by principle, according to research by France’s national institute of health and medical research, Inserm. Some have fears over side-effects and four out of 10 may have difficulties accessing the relevant health services for free vaccines, including elderly people isolated in rural communities. Nevertheless, divisions in society are becoming clear. Jérôme Fourquet of the pollsters Ifop said 51% of French people felt they were in danger when in contact with a non-vaccinated person and 51% felt non-vaccinated people should pay all or part of the cost of their treatment in intensive care. These views are higher among over-65s, who are being courted by both Macron and Pécresse. More than 100,000 people protested against the vaccine pass across France last weekend, saying it curbed their liberties. More demonstrations are expected on Saturday. “Non-vaccinated people are being held responsible for the latest Covid wave in France, but it’s lack of government hospital-funding that created the problems,” said a 27-year-old woman from Paris who works in the public sector for a government ministry and has not been vaccinated because she fears unknown side-effects. She had voted for Mélenchon in the past, but might now vote far right. “Strangely, it’s the right which now seems more likely to defend our liberties as non-vaccinated people.” Polls show Macron is the favourite to top the first round of the presidential election and could beat a far-right candidate in the final contest, but would face a challenge from Pécresse if she makes the second round. Antoine Bristielle, the director of opinion at the Fondation Jean Jaurès thinktank, said the current priority for French voters was purchasing power and making ends meet. “But in second place is Covid, which has made a spectacular return as an election concern in recent months,” he said. He felt that Macron could benefit from the fact that voters often looked for stability and known leaders in a crisis. But he said: “There is currently an extreme mistrust among French people towards politics and institutions … Only six out of 10 French people are certain they will turn out to vote in the presidential election –– 10 points lower than the same period for the last election.” Stewart Chau, a sociologist and consultant at the pollsters Viavoice, said 57% of French people defined their current state of mind as “fatigued”, worsened by the pandemic. He said that although there was broad approval of Macron’s handling of the economy during the pandemic, there is a limit to politicians’ ability to capitalise on Covid “because French people clearly want to move on to something else”.",News/World news,Election battle lines set as Macron pits himself against France’s unvaccinated,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/election-battle-lines-set-as-macron-pits-himself-against-frances-unvaccinated
1/15/2022,"Hospitals in nearly half of US states are nearing capacity, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, as the Omicron variant has triggered a record number of cases across the country. In 18 states at least 85% of adult intensive care unit beds were in use, while in 24 states at least 80% of staffed hospital beds were occupied, HHS data shows.  Alabama, Missouri, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Texas and Wisconsin are among the states suffering a particular shortage of ICU beds. In Texas, which this week set a new record for Covid-19 cases reported in a single day, with 75,817 total new cases, more than 92% of ICU beds are occupied, according to HHS, 34.3% of the beds occupied by Covid-19 patients. In Wisconsin 90.6% of ICU beds are occupied, 41.4% of those with Covid-19 patients. Rhode Island and Alabama each has more than 91% of ICU beds occupied. The New York Times first reported on the HHS data. The south has been hit particularly hard by the new variant, with states continuing to report record case numbers amid serious concern around hospital staff shortages. On Thursday Joe Biden said 1,000 members of the military will be dispatched to help mitigate staffing crunches at hospitals across the country, with many facilities struggling because their workers are in at-home quarantines due to the virus at the same time as Covid-19 cases have surged. The US leads the world in the daily average number of new infections reported, accounting for one in every three infections reported worldwide, according to a Reuters tally. Data suggests cases may be beginning to plateau in New York and the east coast after extraordinary surges. However, Texas has reported a test positivity rate of more than 35% over the past week, WFAA.com reported, as the Texas department of state and health services said “Covid has never spread this fast” in the state. Alabama state reported a record number of children hospitalized with coronavirus this week, due to the highly transmissible Omicron variant. At least 60 children had been hospitalized with 13 receiving treatment in intensive care. The state has recorded a number of record case highs throughout January as officials continue to urge all those eligible to receive the Covid vaccine. State health officials told the Montgomery Advertiser they were “extremely concerned” about the rise of hospitalizations among children and parents to get their children inoculated. Vaccination rates in Alabama also remain low, with just 48% of the population fully vaccinated. On Thursday, the supreme court blocked the Biden administration from enforcing a requirement that employees at large businesses be vaccinated against Covid-19 or undergo weekly testing and wear a mask on the job. The court’s conservative majority concluded the administration overstepped its authority by seeking to impose the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (Osha) vaccine-or-test rule on US businesses with at least 100 employees. More than 80 million people would have been affected. Biden has pledged to deliver 1bn free at-home test kits to Americans, as a test kit shortage across the country continues to hamper efforts to control the Omicron variant. Biden said a website where people can request tests will launch next week. In New York City, the number of new cases has flattened in recent days, the New York Times reported, while New Jersey and Maryland have seen a slight decrease in the number of infections. “Every case is one too many, but if you watch the trend line, it looks like we may be cresting over that peak,” Kathy Hochul, governor of New York, said in a briefing this week. “We are not at the end, but this is a glimmer of hope when we desperately need that.”",News/US news,Hospitals in half of US states close to capacity as Omicron continues surge,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/14/us-hospitals-capacity-staffing-shortages-omicron-covid
