1/15/2022,"Labour members in the House of Lords are to oppose last-minute amendments to the police and crime bill, which human rights activists have described as “a dangerous power grab”, in a move that could kill the proposals entirely. In low-key announcement on the LabourLordsUK Twitter account, before midday on Friday, the party said it would be “opposing protest clauses added late” to the bill, a reference to 18 pages of amendments introduced by the government in November.  Unlike the rest of the bill, however, where the lords can merely send amendments back to the Commons to be reconsidered, because the latest amendments were introduced in the Lords they will fall if peers vote against them. Labour’s decision to oppose sections of the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill means that with the Greens, the Liberal Democrats and some independents there will be enough votes to defeat the government. It comes after intensive lobbying. Liberal Democrat and Green party peers have already said they would oppose the amendments and called on Labour to do the same, a call echoed by the civil rights groups Liberty and Big Brother Watch, and environmental groups, including Greenpeace and Extinction Rebellion. The Guardian contacted Labour for clarification on the announcement on Friday night, but was not immediately able to get any further comment from the party. Lady Jenny Jones, the Green party peer, said she welcomed Labour’s support at what she described as a “crunch time for opposition to this increasingly authoritarian government”. “These are Belarus-style laws, but the Lords can stop them if we can motivate enough peers to stay with us during Monday’s late night sitting and vote for basic democratic values,” she said. “It’s no way to run a country, but a lot will come down to stamina and I’m bringing my sleeping bag.” The late amendments, which focus on new powers to control protests, were introduced to the Lords on the day nine Insulate Britain protesters were sent to jail for breaking injunctions banning road block actions. Among them were new offences of locking on, where protesters attach themselves to objects or each other to make it more difficult for police to remove them, being equipped to lock on, wilful obstruction of the highway and obstruction of major transport works, all with potential 51-week jail sentences. They would also beef up police powers of stop and search, with reasonable grounds extended to include items intended for use in connection with disruptive protests and new orders to allow for suspicionless stop and search around protests. They would also introduce asbo-style “serious disruption prevention orders” that would allow authorities to ban named individuals from participating in demonstrations or even using the internet to encourage others to do so. Labour said it was not intending to oppose all the measures. According to the announcement, the party will attempt to amend rather than vote down the road block clause to narrow its scope to the “strategic roads network”. Critics fear this will leave space for the government to revert to these clauses in the Commons. The Home Office has been contacted for comment.",News/Politics,Labour peers to oppose amendments to police and crime bill,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/14/labour-peers-to-oppose-amendments-to-police-and-bill
1/15/2022,"Campaigners have called on the government to urge people not to drive or light wood-burning stoves during toxic air peaks rather than telling the vulnerable not to exercise or go outside. London suffered its worst air pollution since 2018 on Friday, when experts predicted it would reach “band 10”, the highest level on the scale.  The government issued warnings and advised older people and those with lung or heart problems to avoid strenuous physical activity. Even healthy people were told to “reduce physical exertion, particularly outdoors, especially if you experience symptoms such as a cough or sore throat”. Air pollution campaigners, however, said it was unacceptable to impose more restrictions on elderly or unwell people rather than address the sources of pollution. Jemima Hartshorn of Mums for Lungs said: “Londoners are facing the highest pollution episode in years. It has been known for days that today would be very bad for health and what we need is a clear call to every Londoner not to drive, idle vehicles or burn wood. “Just asking vulnerable people not to exercise, without asking everyone else not to reduce their contribution to pollution is unfair and absolves people from their responsibility.” Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr, said: “Resorting to telling people not to exercise during a spike in air pollution levels is like asking victims of burglary not to get robbed. “While health warnings must be taken seriously, they must come with a request for Londoners to halt all non-essential driving and the use of wood burners. Only by stopping the causes of air pollution will it be brought under control. “London’s dangerous air pollution levels certainly are not the fault of those wanting to go for a jog.” The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which put out this week’s guidance, declined to comment when asked to respond to the campaigners’ calls London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said earlier this week the capital could become mired in gridlock because of a shift towards driving during the Covid pandemic, risking a new health crisis from pollution. Members of Khan’s team did call for people to drive only if it was essential on Friday, but there was no formal message from his office urging Londoners to leave their cars at home or to stop burning wood.",News/Environment,"Tell motorists to help tackle London’s toxic air peaks, authorities urged",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/14/tell-motorists-to-help-tackle-london-toxic-air-peaks-authorities-urged
1/15/2022,"Booster jabs distributed in England for the pre-Christmas vaccination push are to be thrown away because of a lack of demand, a leaked NHS memo reveals. It is not known exactly how many vaccines will be discarded but it is likely to be “hundreds of thousands”, sources told the Health Service Journal (HSJ), which obtained the memo.  The memo, sent on Thursday from NHS England’s vaccination team to officials managing the 3,000 vaccination sites around the country, said some stocks would reach their expiry dates without being used. It urges them to try to use them up until the last minute before they have to be thrown away. It said: “There is a quantity of vaccine in the system, which was released in December to support the booster campaign, that will potentially reach its expiry date within the next couple of weeks before it can be fully used. All sites must ensure they make every effort to use this … and prioritise it for all vaccination events coming up until expiry, as per our previous communications.” Unused supplies that are no longer in date should be “quarantined in appropriate medical fridges” at the correct temperature, it adds. Vaccinators have been using a combination of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna jabs in the booster campaign, which began in England last September. Primary care bosses blamed the wastage on as many as 30% of people not turning up for their booster appointment. “Primary care teams have given over 30m boosters, so the last thing they want is for any vaccine stock to be at risk of going to waste,” said Ruth Rankine, the director of primary care at the NHS Confederation. “They have arrangements in place with other local sites and commissioners to reduce this risk but with NHS leaders telling us that about 20% to 30% of vaccination appointments are resulting in no-shows this is a real worry. “There will be reasons why people are unable to go to their vaccine appointments including if they are self-isolating, have recently had the virus or have decided to get vaccinated or boosted elsewhere.” People should amend their booking if they realised they could not make it to “help manage supply and demand”, Rankine said. Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “Whilst everything will be done to keep vaccine wastage to a minimum, vaccines do have an expiry date, and if they are unused after this date or can no longer be stored in the correct conditions, they need to be destroyed.” The HSJ quoted a vaccination programme source who said that: “The prime minister’s mission last month was to get everyone boosted by the end of the year, so the national team pushed out the vaccine before Christmas … irrespective of whether regions wanted it. “The relative lack of delivery slots over the holiday period meant it was sent in advance, so hundreds of thousands of doses nationally are now coming to the end of their refrigerated shelf life.” Government figures on the booster rollout show that the number of people across the UK receiving one has fallen recently from a record 968,665 on 21 December to 111,849 on Thursday. An NHS England spokesperson said: “The fastest and most successful vaccination programme in NHS history delivered more than 14m jabs during December 2021 alone, following the prime minister’s call for all adults to be offered a booster vaccine by 31 December. “Despite the deadline having passed, the NHS is continuing to do everything it can to vaccinate as many people as possible against Covid-19 … so please do come forward and book your jab.” Meanwhile, a new report from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has provided updated figures on the effectiveness of booster jabs against Omicron. The report suggests the jabs may offer slightly better protection against severe outcomes than suggested by early data, revealing a third dose reduces the risk of hospitalisation by 92% two to four weeks later, although after 10 weeks or more the figure is lower at 83%. Previous figures from UKHSA put vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation at about 88% for Omicron two or more weeks after three doses of vaccine. “There is further data showing that effectiveness against symptomatic disease is significantly lower compared to the Delta variant, and wanes more quickly,” the report adds. However, the level of protection against Omicron for this outcome remains similar to the earlier report, at about 65-75% two to four weeks after the jab, falling to about 40-50% protection from 10 or more weeks after the booster. The latest report also reveals that a loss of taste and smell is less common with Omicron than with the Delta variant.",News/Society,Covid booster jabs in England to be thrown away as demand falls,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/14/covid-booster-jabs-in-england-to-be-thrown-away-as-demand-falls
1/15/2022,"Claudio Ranieri did not need much time to consider the question. “I’ve had a lot of experience but I’ve never faced a week like this before,” said Watford’s manager. “It’s an extraordinary situation.” The 70-year-old had just been asked whether he had been involved in a run of three games in seven days more pivotal than his latest team’s assignments at fellow relegation strugglers Newcastle on Saturday, Burnley on Tuesday and at home to Norwich next Friday.  “The next three games are very, very, important,” said the man who led Leicester to the title in 2016 yet has latterly presided over six straight Premier league defeats at 17th-placed Watford. “But we are ready for the fight. I believe in my players, I believe in this team and, sooner or later, results on the pitch will tell me: ‘Claudio you are right.’” As Ranieri boarded Watford’s flight from Luton to the north-east on Friday, Eddie Howe was hoping his own judgment would be similarly vindicated. When, a little over a week ago, Newcastle’s manager completed Kieran Trippier’s signing from Atlético Madrid it became apparent the England right-back shares an agent with Chris Wood and that the Burnley striker’s contract contained a £25m release clause. On Saturday Wood is expected to make his Newcastle debut and Howe must trust the most expensive 30-year-old signing in Premier League history makes an instant impact against visitors likely to be bolstered by Emmanuel Dennis’s attacking skills. If Howe is heartened by the absent quartet of first-team stalwarts Ranieri has temporarily lost to the Africa Cup of Nations, Newcastle’s manager will not be overjoyed that an administrative error denied Dennis the chance to represent Nigeria in Cameroon. Instead Watford’s £3.6m, 24-year-old signing from Club Brugge last summer is expected to pass a fitness test en route to St James’ Park, where Dennis hopes to add to his eight league goals in 17 club appearances this season. Given that Wood managed only three in 18 league games before departing Burnley, the sense that Newcastle have overpaid, if not panic-purchased, seems heightened. But that £25m fee could seem a bargain if Howe’s team leapfrog opponents two points and two places above them. With Newcastle having won only once all season – against Burnley – and been knocked out of the FA Cup by League One Cambridge last weekend, it remains a big if. Yet for all Ranieri’s characteristic 100-watt optimism, not to mention the prospective return of the recently sidelined Ben Foster in goal, Watford are hardly in top form either. The Italian’s less than impressive record of two wins and 10 defeats since succeeding Xisco Muñoz meant it came as no surprise when the 15th manager at Vicarage Road in the past 10 years was asked this week whether he feared the sack. Far from taking offence, Ranieri smiled beatifically at the journalist interrogating him over Zoom. “The club believe in me, don’t worry, I have had assurances,” said a man without a victory since the 4-1 deconstruction of Manchester United in late November. “I speak with the board, with the chairman, with everybody, every day and we are all together – it’s fantastic. “I have a lot of experience and I say we will be safe. My experience tells me we are a very good team. Sooner or later, results on the pitch will show us who we really are.” Howe almost certainly needs Ranieri to be wrong, if his own side are to survive. Although Leeds and Everton – coincidentally Newcastle’s next two opponents – could conceivably be dragged into the relegation skirmish, the consensus suggests three of the current bottom four are Championship-bound. “We need wins,” Howe said. “We can’t survive on draws; that won’t be enough.” Much on Saturday could hinge on not only the performance of Watford’s former Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko – still a divisive figure on Tyneside – but the potential impact of Watford’s trio of bargain January signings: Hassane Kamara, Samir and Edo Kayembe, a left-back, centre-half and defensive midfielder, acquired from Nice, Udinese and Eupen respectively. Newcastle’s recent Saudi Arabia-led takeover dictates that Howe – actively seeking two central defenders, a left-back, a midfielder and another forward – is shopping in a very different market. He may find that working for enormously wealthy owners is ultimately unlikely to be any less demanding than working for Watford’s infamously ruthless and controlling Pozzo family. “It’s a unique, delicate and very complex situation,” Howe said. “Newcastle does have a huge pull in many different ways but our league position isn’t one of them. Persuading top players to join a relegation fight is not an easy sell.” Lose to Watford and it will become infinitely harder.",Sport/Football,Ranieri says Watford are ‘ready to fight’ while Eddie Howe looks to Wood,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/14/ranieri-says-watford-are-ready-to-fight-while-eddie-howe-looks-to-wood
1/15/2022,"The Duke of York faces calls to pay for his own security and relinquish his dukedom after being stripped of his military affiliations and royal patronages in the fallout over the civil sexual assault case against him. The calls come as his accuser, Virginia Giuffre, welcomed the New York court ruling that paved the way for her lawsuit against Prince Andrew to proceed to trial, as she pledged to “continue to expose the truth”.  Prince Charles – who, with Prince William, was reportedly key to the Queen making her decision on Andrew’s future – ignored questions about his brother while on an engagement in Scotland. With Andrew prevented from using his HRH style in any official capacity and banned from royal duties, calls were growing for him to lose his taxpayer-funded Scotland Yard security and his title Duke of York. Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, tweeted it was “untenable” for Andrew to cling on to his title “another day longer”, and Darryl Smalley, a senior member of City of York council, launched a campaign to strip Andrew of his dukedom. It's untenable for the Duke of York to cling onto his title another day longer; this association with York must end. There's a very serious allegation made against this man of privilege & entitlement. I'm working with agencies to tackle sexual violence & misogyny. #NotInYorksName The security minister, Damian Hinds, refused to confirm whether taxpayers would continue to fund Andrew’s security arrangements, telling LBC: “Our security forces, the police and others, do what they judge is necessary to protect our country, to protect people in it.” It was a “longstanding and I think correct principle that we don’t talk about who and how in particular”, he added. Andrew has made clear he intends to continue to fight to clear his name over allegations made by Giuffre, 38, that she was forced into having sex with him when she was 17 and had been trafficked by the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. He vehemently denies the allegations. A source close to the duke said on Thursday: “This is a marathon not a sprint and the duke will continue to defend himself against these claims.” As a senior royal, he has round-the-clock Scotland Yard protection. Security costs are never discussed by Buckingham Palace or the Metropolitan police. But it has been reportedly estimated that the annual cost to the taxpayer of guarding Andrew could be up to £2m. Graham Smith, of the campaign group Republic, questioned whether the taxpayer should fund security for any royals except the head of state. Of Andrew, he said: “Given that he’s no longer in any real sense a member of the royal household it does make sense he pays for his own security.” The question of taxpayer-funded security for non-working royals was last raised when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped down. When Harry and Meghan made public their decision early last year, their website suggested that the Home Office, through the Metropolitan police, should continue to provide protection for the couple and their young son, Archie. The Sussexes later signed multimillion-pound deals with Netflix and Spotify, with the duke telling Oprah Winfrey he had secured them to pay for his security. The former Home Office minister and royal author Norman Baker said: “[Andrew] has, like Harry, kept his HRH even if he is not using it. But that means he still qualifies to spend public money and qualifies for security. He is no longer carrying out royal duties, so should have the HRH taken away along with his security.” Baker also called for him to have his dukedom revoked. As Andrew faces mounting legal bills, it is not known if the Queen is assisting him with these privately. He receives an allowance from the Queen from her Duchy of Lancaster estate and may benefit from personal investments and bequests from family members. He also has a modest naval pension. He lives in the grace-and-favour Royal Lodge at Windsor and is now in the process of selling a ski chalet he co-owns with his ex-wife, Sarah, Duchess of York. He sold his former marital home, Sunninghill Park near Windsor, which was a wedding gift from the Queen, in 2007 to the son-in-law of the former ruler of Kazakhstan for £15m, £3m over the asking price. The duke’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, received official protection until 2011 but now must foot the bill themselves. Giuffre has praised Wednesday’s court ruling that rejected legal arguments by Andrew’s lawyer to have her case against him dismissed. She wrote on Twitter that she was pleased with the ruling, adding: “I’m glad I will have the chance to continue to expose the truth & I am deeply grateful to my extraordinary legal team. “Their determination helps me seek justice from those who hurt me and so many others. My goal has always been to show that the rich and powerful are not above the law & must be held accountable.”",News/UK news,Prince Andrew facing calls to pay for his own security ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/14/prince-andrew-facing-calls-pay-for-own-security
1/15/2022,"Aweek that began with low expectations has ended with a still bleaker mood. No one believed that three rounds of talks between the US, Russia and others would magically resolve the Ukraine crisis. But with 100,000 Russian troops massed near the country’s borders, the build up of weaponry and growing sabre-rattling from Moscow, the hope was that the negotiations could help to probe Vladimir Putin’s intentions, and perhaps offer him pathways towards an eventual de-escalation. After several days of dialogue, the mood is glummer. On Thursday, the Polish foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, warned that Europe was the closest to war it had been for three decades. After the Nato discussions, and before the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe talks concluded, Russian’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said the parties had reached a dead end.  Russian troop flows continued as the talks took place. The head of the International Energy Agency complained that Russia was withholding gas exports, deepening Europe’s energy crisis. On Friday morning, Ukraine said it had experienced a massive overnight cyber-attack on official websites. Shortly afterwards, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told reporters that Moscow had “run out of patience”. The US alleged that Moscow has positioned saboteurs in Ukraine ready for a “false flag” operation to use as a pretext for a Russian attack. Washington and Moscow were never going to agree to each other’s headline demands – Russia, that Nato must close its doors to new members in the east (though it knows full well Nato has no plans to let in Ukraine and Georgia, but cannot say so) and roll back troops and weaponry in central and eastern Europe; the US, that Russia should withdraw from Ukraine’s borders. The US sensibly focused on issues that could reduce security risks and be of interest to Russia: missile agreements and military drills. But these are at best of second order importance to Mr Putin, who appears increasingly anxious to force Nato to shrink its sphere of influence, satisfying a long-held Russian grievance over its expansion, and end the standoff over Ukraine that began when Russia annexed Crimea and sparked the conflict in the Donbas. A 2015 peace deal, which has not prevented ongoing skirmishing, is said to be close to collapse. Russia denies it is planning to invade but has talked of a “military-technical response” to what it calls Nato aggression. None of this means that the talks were a mistake – even if it proves to be the case, as some fear, that Russia participated in them as part of its march towards war. Mr Putin’s record gives no reason to doubt his willingness to go to war, and he paid little price for 2014. But it was right to offer Russia opportunities for de-escalation, even if it shows little interest in taking them. Nor does the depressing end to the week prove that military action – still less a full scale invasion – is inevitable. There is a relatively short period of winter in which an offensive is feasible, and Mr Putin cannot leave his troops in place for ever – though he could leave hardware in position. Western nations are flagging sanctions packages and the fate of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline as a deterrent. Defence assistance for Ukraine – including through bolstering its efforts to fend off cyber-attacks – is necessary, but is unlikely to be sufficient to be gamechanging. Mr Putin’s intentions remain uncertain, with his diplomats perhaps not much clearer than their western counterparts. The Kremlin has said it will wait for written responses to its demands from Washington and Nato next week. As discouraging as the signals this week were, the waiting game continues.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Russia and Ukraine: what comes after jaw-jaw? | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/14/the-guardian-view-on-russia-and-ukraine-what-comes-after-jaw-jaw
1/15/2022,"The term “plant blindness” was coined in 1998 to describe our general tendency, as humans, not to see the plant life that surrounds us. The problem has understandable roots: the human brain evolved to detect difference, and then to categorise that difference as either threat or non-threat. Plants, being unlikely to attack, are lumped together and treated as background, a green screen against which dramas take place. Many plants, and especially trees, exist on a different timescale to humans – who, moreover, have spent millennia dividing existence into conscious beings and things, where the former are afforded automatic importance over the latter. Combined with the general move to cities, and then to screen-based life indoors, this has resulted in, for example, up to half of British children being unable to identify stinging nettles, brambles or bluebells; 82% of those questioned could not recognise an oak leaf. We become more emotionally involved in what we can comprehend. Plants, as David Attenborough reminds us in his new BBC series, The Green Planet, “are the basis of all life, including ourselves”. And yet the beauty and power – and scope for anthropomorphism – of the polar bear, the snow leopard, the orangutan mean many more will campaign to save them than, say, crested cow-wheat.  During lockdown, when people were forced to be still, or to go on daily walks, more of us began to notice plants, and to care for them. A pre-existing rise in houseplant nurture became exponential. There has been a parallel increase in interest in how they interconnect. Peter Wohlleben’s bestseller The Hidden Life of Trees argues that they communicate, care for each other and are part of a “wood-wide web”, as does Suzanne Simard’s Finding the Mother Tree; botanists such as Stefano Mancuso argue for a kind of plant intelligence. Richard Powers’ Booker-shortlisted The Overstory (which contains a character based on Simard) also hit a nerve. The Green Planet takes these trends, applies extraordinary new technology that contracts the timescale to human speed, and, of course, adds Attenborough’s dramatic narrative: in the first episode, about the rainforest (which covers 6% of Earth but contains more than 80% of its biodiversity), this was balsa leaves battling for sunlight; leaf-cutter ant troops sent out on errands by an underground fungus; vine tendrils waving through the air like grappling hooks. The aim, says Attenborough, is to see the world from the plants’ point of view – which is, of course, the definition of empathy. It is incredibly effective. When the camera pans out to show that the dense patch of forest Attenborough is standing in is not only next to a road but is a small island in a sea of farmland, the shock is visceral. It is also a vivid illustration of the problems of habitat fragmentation, a process studied by the late Thomas Lovejoy, who saw that ecosystems can shrink to the point where they can no longer survive. Plant corridors, like corridors for wild animals, can keep species connected; the rainforest could, if given the space, begin to heal itself. Understory must urgently become overstory: The Green Planet, by enacting its own argument, makes this abundantly, verdantly clear.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on The Green Planet: verdant and necessary | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/14/the-guardian-view-on-the-green-planet-verdant-and-necessary
1/15/2022,"Adazzling pink castle perches atop the coastal cliffs of Calpe, near Alicante in southern Spain, its pastel turrets standing like a coral outcrop above the shore. The high fortified walls hide a vertical maze of staircases and terraces within, painted in shades of baby blue, lilac and red, opening out on to the sparkling waters of hidden rooftop pools. This candy-coloured citadel of holiday apartments is the work of Ricardo Bofill, the maverick Catalan architect who has died aged 82. He spent a lifetime conjuring otherworldly buildings, which now stand like monuments from some future-primitive sci-fi civilisation. Half a century after their construction, his fantastical creations have inspired a whole new generation, being used as futuristic film sets and influencing the aesthetic of everything from the Monument Valley video game to the cult TV show Squid Game, whose stairs he designed.  Completed in 1973, La Muralla Roja was a spectacular arrival to this sun-kissed coast, otherwise dotted with traditional whitewashed villas and generic concrete apartment blocks. At once ancient and modern, it echoed the dense casbahs of traditional north African cities, with their labyrinthine layouts of narrow alleyways, courtyards and high adobe towers, translated into a vertiginous Escher-like world. Today it swarms with selfie-snapping influencers and music-video location scouts, a seductive pastel backdrop for the Instagram era. Bofill was a glamorous star of postmodernism in the 1970s and 80s, enjoying international fame and a playboy lifestyle, but as fashions changed his expressive work fell out of favour. When I met him in 2017, he was thrilled that his projects were being rediscovered by a new, colour-starved generation, enrapt by his psychedelic, sculptural worlds. “When I was 35, I was the most fashionable architect in the world,” he told me, with characteristic immodesty. “But I was always an outsider, never fitting in with architectural culture.” After being expelled from the Barcelona School of Architecture for his Marxist views, when General Franco was in power, he founded his office in 1963 as a multi-disciplinary collective, bringing together poets, sociologists, philosophers, writers and film-makers. He set up his home and workshop in an old cement factory on the outskirts of Barcelona, a place with the theatrical air of a Bond villain’s hideout, featuring white leather sofas in stark concrete silos, all dripping with lush greenery. He lived and worked here for the rest of his life, and it is where his two sons, Ricardo Emilio and Pablo, continue to lead the firm. A self-styled outsider, Bofill initially shunned the architectural canon and turned instead to studying vernacular buildings on his travels around the Mediterranean and north Africa. “I’ve never liked architectural theory,” he told me. “So, from the beginning, I’ve always looked at traditional and vernacular buildings.” Enthralled by the tightly packed villages of Ibiza, where staircases are built into houses’ facades, forming hillsides of homes and terraces in an organic, higgledy-piggledy whole, he travelled further south to try to find the origins of this kind of primitive dwelling. “I learned more in the middle of the Sahara, among nothing but dunes and sand, than in a French palace,” he said. Combining what he learned from the mud-walled buildings of the Tuareg people, with hi-tech ideas for modular “plug-in” architecture being dreamed up by radical 60s groups such as Archigram, he developed a style that was very much his own.His Walden 7 housing project, which stands as a monumental terracotta termite mound on the outskirts of Barcelona, seems as radical today as when it was built in 1975. The 450 apartments are arranged in a dense 14-storey cluster, grouped around five courtyards, lined with bright azure tiles, and connected by bridges and balconies, creating a dramatic three-dimensional matrix of views and enclosures, crowned with rooftop pools. This vertical beehive was an experiment in Bofill’s vision for a utopian co-operative community, its modular system intended to adapt to changing family needs. “It was about liberation from the traditional family structure,” he told me, wistfully. “I was supposed to be accessible to everyone, and every resident would have a share. Now it’s become a bit more bourgeois – the price has gone up and the community is a bit insular. They don’t want to let anybody in.” His projects wouldn’t always turn out as he hoped, the utopian rhetoric sometimes falling short in reality. His series of monumental housing estates built on the outskirts of Paris in the late 70s and early 80s became a byword for the excesses of puffed-up postmodernism. Looking like a Stalinist Disneyland, his Espaces d’Abraxas project was neoclassicism on steroids, encircling grand civic spaces with gigantic fluted columns and heavy concrete pediments. It featured in Terry Gilliam’s 1985 film Brazil, and more recently provided a dystopian backdrop for The Hunger Games. But, just like his work in Spain, the buildings have enjoyed a renewed appreciation as part of the ongoing pomo revival, fuelled by their appearance in pop culture, fans revelling in the sheer overwhelming architectural power. As Bofill put it: “I wanted, once and for all, to create a space powerful enough to make normal people who know nothing about architecture realise that architecture exists.”",Arts/Art and design,Ricardo Bofill: the outsider architect who gave 60s Spain a sci-fi makeover,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/14/ricardo-bofill-the-outsider-architect-who-gave-60s-spain-a-sci-fi-makeover
1/15/2022,"In Westminster, the focus is usually on the corridors of power. This week, the spotlight fell on some rather different aisles: the wine shelves of three local shops that appear to have done a roaring trade during lockdown as a party culture gripped Whitehall. So much so, a suitcase was needed to carry all the booze for one late-night Downing Street “gathering”.  On Friday, when the Guardian visited the three supermarkets closest to No 10 – two branches of Tesco Metro and one Co-op – staff couldn’t recall that particular occasion. But they said they were accustomed to the sight of well-heeled men and women in suits buying large amounts of wine, often on Friday afternoons or in the evenings.Perhaps because they know their clientele, all three branches seemed surprisingly well-stocked with alcohol. In the Strand branch of Co-op, where wine was allegedly sourced for the latest party to emerge, on 21 April 2021, there is a wide selection of fine reds and whites, with £20 bottles of Châteauneuf-du-Pape and Barolo available. There’s also an entire section dedicated to champagne, including £45 bottles of Bollinger.Both Tesco Metros offer a wide selection of more affordable alternatives, starting with £2 a bottle of Lambrini. There’s a small selection of cheeses, too – and party favourite, cheese strings. Local workers and passersby who spoke to the Guardian were unamused by reports of Westminster staff’s lockdown antics. “Hypocrisy” was an oft-repeated word and many were unsurprised that politicians and government officials, perceived as coming from highly privileged backgrounds, would see themselves as above the law.Hayley Lloyd, 18, was shocked that government officials would ignore coronavirus restrictions just to hold a party while other people had lost loved ones and missed out on spending time with family.She felt Johnson’s apology “didn’t mean anything”, and that “things would be different if he took responsibility”. She saw his lack of contrition as coming from a place of entitlement rather than being held to account. “He’ll just go back to his multimillion-pound home”.There was a pervasive sense that the Downing Street parties reflect a rotten political culture. Kevin Adegbola, a 22-year-old marketing assistant, said he wasn’t surprised because “there are always untruths spoken by people in power”. He felt that Johnson should be more transparent about what he knew as “people are losing trust”.Charlie Smith, who works in the arts, said the parties suggested decision-makers “didn’t believe their own guidance”.This was a view shared by Eve Wedderburn, 45, who runs a business in the area.

1/15/2022,"It’s hard to know whether to laugh or cry at the BBC’s latest pronouncement rejecting cancel culture, when the example given is the willingness to give a fair hearing to flat-Earthers (BBC does not subscribe to ‘cancel culture’, says director of editorial policy, 11 January). It’s nothing new for the BBC to give a platform to fantasists, of course; but there did seem to be an acknowledgment post-Brexit that it had perhaps been wrong to give equal weighting to fact and delusion. And there must be someone at the national broadcaster who regrets affording quite so many opportunities to Nigel Lawson to deny climate change reality on the airwaves. Which other minority beliefs can we now expect to be expounded in the 8.10am interview on the Today programme? It’s surely time we looked seriously at the view that the Covid vaccine is connecting us to a vast AI network, and that upstate New York was once inhabited by giants. There are also apparently people who still believe that Boris Johnson is a great prime minister, though finding a government minister to represent that view this week may be beyond even the bending-over-backwards, non-cancelling capacity of the BBC.Helen JohnsonSedbergh, Cumbria   It was disappointing to read that David Jordan, the BBC’s director of editorial policy, told a House of Lords committee that “if a lot of people believed in flat Earth we’d need to address it more” in order to ensure impartiality. He appears to have forgotten that the BBC’s editorial guidelines also state that the broadcaster is “committed to achieving due accuracy in all its output”. Or perhaps he is genuinely unaware that for the past couple of millennia the shape of the Earth has not been just a matter of opinion, but instead has been established as a verifiable scientific fact. Either way, let us hope that the BBC’s new action plan on impartiality and editorial standards does not lead the broadcaster to promote more of the daft and dangerous views of those who believe that Covid-19 vaccines do not work or greenhouse gas emissions are not heating Earth.Bob WardPolicy and communications director, Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment  The BBC’s stated policy to “represent all points of view” is worrying on two levels. First, where does the policy stop? There are people out there who think the value of a person depends upon their gender or skin tone – should those views be represented? What about Holocaust deniers? And those who think homosexuality, or marrying the wrong person, should be punished by death? Second, one of the BBC’s worst failures this century has been to present ill-informed opinion as being equal in value to professional expertise – most notably on climate change. At the absolute minimum, it needs to make crystal clear who is and who is not an expert. A lot of misinformation originates from well-funded pressure groups, which need no help getting their message across. So if we must hear ill-informed opinions, let it be from a person on the street – then at least the defence of representing public opinion would have some merit.Dr Richard MilneEdinburgh  According to your report, David Jordan, the BBC’s director of editorial policy, told a Lords committee that the corporation does not subscribe to “cancel culture” and that everyone should have their views represented by the BBC, even if they believe Earth is flat, adding that “flat-Earthers are not going to get as much space as people who believe the Earth is round … And if a lot of people believed in flat Earth we’d need to address it more.” I understand that many Americans fervently believe in the QAnon conspiracy theory and most of the Republican party believes that Donald Trump won the last presidential election – and here in the UK there are substantial numbers of anti-vaxxers. I assume that Mr Jordan will now ensure that the views of these groups are given airtime on the BBC’s channels commensurate with their numbers. In fact, it appears that Mr Jordan has no genuine editorial policy – which would require him to make judgments based on facts and values – only a desperate anxiety to appease the cultural warriors on the right of the Conservative party.Piers BurnettSinnington, North Yorkshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/15/2022,"The decision to have a vasectomy requires deep reflection, of course (‘More people is the last thing this planet needs’: the men getting vasectomies to save the world, 12 January). If the reasons for making that choice include concern about the impact of a growing population or the quality of life any child may face in the future, the individual’s right to have the surgery must be respected. It is a tragedy that we have allowed our environmental crisis to go so far, so quickly, that it should influence any person’s choice regarding parenthood, but it is the reality we must all now live with. That our numbers have contributed to this crisis is beyond question, and it is regrettable that Simon Usborne’s otherwise excellent article rehearses outdated canards regarding “theories of overpopulation” that obscure the progressive, rights-based population argument embedded in principles of social and environmental justice. With positive solutions such as women’s empowerment, education and modern family planning at the heart of addressing population growth, this is a discussion that needs to be had more widely, rather than closed down.Robin MaynardDirector, Population Matters   Thank you for the sobering article about childless young men seeking vasectomies. These men are realistic about the future, and are therefore taking a wise step. In the past many young men gave their lives in the world wars so that we could enjoy a good life; now some are taking steps to ensure that their progeny will not end up as cannon fodder in resource wars. This sad reality is the outcome of the prevailing mentality which still pursues ecocidal growth economics on a finite planet where we have been exceeding the biocapacity for more than 50 years. Our woefully inadequate net zero policies will be increasingly jeopardised by the financial and food insecurities caused by the escalating climate crisis. In truth, as long as we persist with the GDP growth paradigm, we shall continue to fuel our ecological nosedive, for GDP is also a measure of ecological degradation.Barbara WilliamsLong Hanborough, Oxfordshire",News/Environment,Getting sterilised to save the planet is a sad but understandable choice | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/14/getting-sterilised-to-save-the-planet-is-a-sad-but-understandable-choice
1/15/2022,"Your report (Bus services in England face axe as end to emergency Covid funding looms, 11 January) doesn’t mention the most economic solution to connect communities to town centres – the minibus. I am an honorary director of West Oxfordshire Community Transport (WOCT), which runs five minibus services linking estates and villages to the centres of Witney and Carterton. Some of these places used to have bus services, but the routes were hugely subsidised as there were only small numbers of passengers rattling around in expensive doubledeckers. Although overall demand was low, there was a demand for the service from people who had no access to a car – usually people on low incomes or people who are unable to drive.  A minibus of up to 16 seats is much cheaper to operate – the driver doesn’t have to have a public service vehicle licence, and the capital cost is much lower. However, all passenger minibuses in the UK are converted vans and, while the few companies that do these conversions do them reasonably well, structurally they are not really up to taking the weight of 16 passengers and a driver over a prolonged period of time. Our services are subsidised, as most such services meeting a social need will be, by the local authorities. There is a huge opportunity for a company to be established in the UK to produce right-hand-drive minibuses for passenger use. If it is accepted that the cost-effective solution to providing links from communities to town centres, or frequent public transport services, is the minibus then the government should seriously consider establishing a minibus production company in this country.Mike ParkerDirector, WOCT; former director general, Nexus (the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive)  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/15/2022,"Working in the film industry, Denis O’Dell, who has died aged 98, was a fixer, usually credited as an associate producer or assistant director and ensuring that everything was in place to make the film within budgetary constraints. He did not mind that others took the glory that he had made possible. Best known for his association with the Beatles, he worked on their first film, A Hard Day’s Night (1964), and was the producer on their television film Magical Mystery Tour (1967). When the film company United Artists asked him to work with the director Richard Lester on A Hard Day’s Night, initially O’Dell was not keen. “I didn’t want to make a pop film as usually they are just a vehicle for making money,” he recalled. “Bud Ornstein told me: ‘These guys won’t last and we want to do it as cheaply and quickly as possible.’ I said I wasn’t interested, but my kids said: ‘Are you serious?’ I immediately took to Richard Lester as he liked taking chances: we shot moving scenes on a train rather than use back projection.”  By careful planning, the film ran to budget: “The final cost was £180,000 and United Artists’ share of the music track paid for the entire film in three days.” United Artists had the bargain of a lifetime, but O’Dell had a harder task in 1980 when the costs of its epic western Heaven’s Gate were spiralling out of control and he was asked as executive producer to rein it in. The director Michael Cimino needed another $5m as he wanted to film a lavish ball. Furthermore, his preferred location, the Sheldonian theatre in Oxford, had turned him down. O’Dell secured that location and demonstrated how the shoot there could be reduced from 12 days to five. “It wasn’t difficult,” he told me in 2002. “I had seen Lester use multiple cameras and I suggested that.” The film was wrapped up relatively quickly with O’Dell skilfully persuading John Hurt to return to the set even though his patience had been stretched to the limit. O’Dell was born in Kensington, London, to Elizabeth (nee Gills) and John O’Dell. He was one of nine children, and although he won a scholarship to Kingston grammar school, his parents could not afford to buy the uniform. On leaving school he worked as a teaboy on the film The Arsenal Stadium Mystery (1939) and then joined the RAF, hoping to train as a pilot. This was not possible because of his colour blindness. He instead became an engineer and was seconded to the New Zealand air force. After the second world war O’Dell became a chauffeur for film executives and used the opportunity to learn about the business. He was appointed assistant director to Brian Desmond Hurst on Scrooge (1951), starring Alastair Sim, an innovative film with its use of dissolves and overlaps. After working on several features, O’Dell became the associate producer for the comedy Carry on Admiral (1957) with David Tomlinson. It was clearly the inspiration for Carry on Sergeant (1958), the film that started the franchise. In 1963 he was associate producer for a big-budget Viking epic for Columbia Pictures, The Long Ships with Richard Widmark and Sidney Poitier, and then came his involvement with the Beatles. In 1966, when Lester was looking for finance for his black comedy How I Won the War, O’Dell met the Beatles’ manager, Brian Epstein, on his behalf. Epstein agreed and suggested a role for John Lennon. O’Dell co-produced with the Beatles on the TV movie Magical Mystery Tour but he wished the script had been better coordinated. He recalled: “Paul had wanted to repay the BBC for their loyalty to the Beatles and they responded by showing it in black and white.” (The film was broadcast shortly afterwards in colour). His efforts to get the Beatles to record their own voices for the animated film Yellow Submarine (1968) fell on deaf ears. “They should have done it as they would have invented so much stuff.” O’Dell was appointed a director of Apple Corps and the head of Apple films, although there was never the finance to do anything special. Maybe that was just as well as his idea for the four Beatles in The Lord of the Rings with Lennon as Gandalf seems too weird even for the psychedelic 60s and certainly for JRR Tolkien, who vetoed the project. He did, however, secure funding for The Magic Christian (1969), with Peter Sellers and Ringo Starr and a script written by Terry Southern, John Cleese and Graham Chapman. It was a troubled shoot with an unpredictable Sellers firing a continuity girl for wearing purple. O’Dell was impressed by Badfinger’s score – the group had recently signed to Apple records – and he subsequently helped to promote their albums. O’Dell was namechecked in song by the Beatles, who referred to him as Denis O’Bell in You Know My Name (Look Up the Number), the B-side of Let It Be. It led to anonymous phone calls from persistent fans. In the 1970s O’Dell often worked with Sean Connery and in 1976 he produced Lester’s Robin and Marian, with Connery as an ageing Robin Hood. He had originally secured Charlton Heston for a role in the film but the American star then said he would only play Robin Hood. In 2002, Odell wrote a memoir, At the Apple’s Core: The Beatles from the Inside, with Bob Neaverson. He retired to Almería, Andalusia, and advised several Hollywood directors on locations in Spain. O’Dell had three children, Denise, Shaun and Kevan, with his first wife, Ruby Taylor, whom he married in 1946; the marriage ended in divorce, and Kevan predeceased him. He is survived by his second wife, Donna Barnes, their children, Arran and Laragh, and by Denise and Shaun, 13 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.

1/15/2022,"We have been supporting a “failed” asylum seeker in her struggle against the asylum system. Her case, though exceptionally strong, was never accepted as she had not been willing in her first interview to reveal to a male interpreter details of abuse at the hands of the police. For the last 20 years, her claims were dismissed on the basis that she lacked credibility. We knew otherwise. She was a trained teacher. If one calculates the costs, taking into account the lost income from her not working (tax, national insurance etc), the cost to NGOs that supported her with food, clothing and accommodation, the cost of tribunals, legal and clerical work, and the associated costs of processing her four appeals, the overall cost to the UK state is of the order of £250,000.  This is the real cost of a broken asylum system. Multiply that by the number of disputed claims and the cost to the UK exchequer dwarfs any propaganda made about the burden of asylum seekers on this country. We have just heard that her fourth appeal has been successful: just preparing the claim and taking the papers to be lodged at Liverpool cost several thousand pounds. The cost to her?

1/15/2022,"A former senior civil servant who led the government’s Covid taskforce has apologised for having leaving drinks during lockdown before Christmas 2020. Kate Josephs, who is now chief executive of Sheffield city council, said she was “truly sorry” for the event on 17 December – one day before No 10 held its Christmas party.  The gathering, first revealed by the Telegraph, saw “dozens” of officials from the Cabinet Office’s Covid-19 taskforce attending the event, while the country was in lockdown. On that same day, the government’s official Twitter feed replied to a query asking if employers could hold Christmas parties at the end of the working day. It said: “Hi Mick, although there are exemptions for work purposes, you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.” Josephs tweeted a statement apologising for what happened, saying: “As people know I previously worked in the Cabinet Office Covid taskforce where I was director general from July 2020 to 18 December 2020. “I have been cooperating fully with the Cabinet Office investigations and I do not want to pre-empt the findings of the investigation. However as chief executive of Sheffield city council I am responsible for leading the organisation and working with partners across the city and region to support our Covid response and recovery. That is why I have decided to make a statement. “On the evening of 17 December, I gathered with colleagues that were at work that day, with drinks, in our office in the Cabinet Office, to mark my leaving the civil service. “I am truly sorry that I did this and for the anger that people will feel as a result. Sheffield has suffered greatly during this pandemic, and I apologise unreservedly. “The specific facts of this event will be considered in the context of the Cabinet Office investigation. I did not attend any events at 10 Downing St. I am grateful for the ongoing support of colleagues and partners and need now to ask that people allow the Cabinet Office to complete its investigation.” Terry Fox, leader of Sheffield city council, said: “To be honest I need to express my deep disappointment – people will rightly feel angry and let down. I get that completely. “After everything that Sheffield has been through during the pandemic, this is news that we did not want to receive. “Over the last year, Kate’s been an asset to our city and she is working tirelessly for Sheffield and its people. Our residents will understandably have questions and concerns, and we await the findings of the investigation.” It is the second report of a leaving drinks in Downing Street to have emerged in the last 24 hours.

1/15/2022,"In England, following a Christmas break full of uncertainty about further restrictions, a rise in the number of Omicron Covid cases and disrupted Christmas plans due to self-isolating family members, pupils returned to school at the start of January for a new term. Only a few days before teachers returned to school, new advice emerged from the Department for Education (DfE) saying all secondary school pupils should wear masks in classrooms in an attempt to stem a rise in cases of the Omicron variant.  Three teachers in England speak about their first week of term and their concerns for the coming weeks. “It’s been awful,” said Julia*, who teaches at a secondary school in London. “We had less than half of our students show up for a lateral flow test before the start of term and quite a few of our parents didn’t grant permission for their children to be tested.” Julia said she feels concerned as students are hesitant to wear masks and a significant portion of their staff are off sick. “We are already talking about having to send students home as we don’t have enough cover,” said the 50-year-old who has been in the profession for nearly 20 years. “I’m fully jabbed and have had Covid twice – catching it again is an inevitability at this point.” She said her school has a high number of disadvantaged children and the situation with Covid has become more difficult following years of little to no funding. “We don’t have enough toilets so we use portaloos and sometimes when it rains too much in my classroom it floods. At the end of the day it’s the children who lose out. “I think this government is the absolute pits and schools are being hung out to dry. Announcements are left to the last minute when bigger-picture thinking would be a great help. At the end of the day, good teaching happens when you can plan effectively. I don’t think I’ve known it this bad in schools since I started teaching.” Tom, 40, a deputy headteacher in Essex who leads his secondary school’s Covid response, said staff and student absences have been at their highest this term since the start of the pandemic. “We’ve been letting a different year group back into the school each day and doing on-site testing. But as we wait for year groups to come in, we’re finding that pupils are testing positive,” he said. “So I’ve been spending much of my time informing staff of students who are positive, making sure online learning is set up, and letting families know when their child will return. We’ve got so many that we’ve had to put them on a centralised spreadsheet.” The school is well prepared for remote teaching, said Tom, but staff shortages concern him. “In mid-December, we started to get hit quite badly. At the beginning of the holiday, myself and 20% of my colleagues tested positive. It was my second positive result during the pandemic. It was obviously disarming for those of us who couldn’t see our families over the Christmas period.” This term, the school has introduced the compulsory wearing of masks in communal spaces, according to government guidance. However, Tom is frustrated that the rule is unenforceable. “The DfE said no child should be denied an education if they refuse to wear a mask. The vast majority of our students are really good about it, but we feel a bit hamstrung. The DfE doesn’t seem to be able to make a decision.” For Amanda* in Birmingham, the Covid situation at her school is better than they expected it to be. “We haven’t had many absences compared to other times during the pandemic,” said the secondary school teacher. “Staff absence is very low and our children have been incredibly complaint about masks.” Her main concern is the lack of ventilation and the threat of an inspection from Ofsted. “I have a CO2 monitor in my classroom but no real guidance on how to use it. The readings appear to be normal but if it gets high, what am I supposed to do? I already have the windows open. “Workload is a huge problem at the moment. We are trying to help students catch up, and prepare them for exams and teacher-assessed grades, all the while with the threat of Ofsted hanging over us. It’s a fear for many of us and feels like the DfE have forgotten teachers are not immune to the pressures of Covid, let alone preparing for an inspection.” With the added pay freeze from 2021, Amanda and her colleagues are feeling the pinch of the continuing pressure. “Teaching used to be a well-paid job with a good pension but with inflation at an all-time high, and energy bills going up now I’m not sure how much longer I can continue.” *Some names have been changed.",News/Education,‘It’s been awful’: teachers at English secondary schools on the first week back,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/14/its-been-awful-teachers-at-english-secondary-schools-on-the-first-week-back

1/15/2022,"It’s come to something when there’s more accountability in a hereditary monarchy than in our elected government. Even in Buckingham Palace there are consequences for one’s actions, as Prince Andrew learned on Thursday, when he was stripped of his sort-of jobs. In the Palace of Westminster, not so much. The contrast could hardly be sharper. On one side, a Queen so determined to show that she was not above the rules that she grieved alone as she buried the man she had loved for 73 years. On the other, a prime minister running Downing Street like a frat house, where bottles were reportedly brought in by the suitcase and they danced in the basement even on the eve of that austere royal funeral, even in the midst of a lockdown.  And yet, Johnson remains in his post, his titles still his to use. There’s confident chatter, briefed to the papers, that he’ll get away with it. His team is already spinning in advance the report of the civil service inquisitor, Sue Gray, suggesting that she will find no criminal wrongdoing – deliberately misunderstanding the role of her inquiry – thereby setting the bar sufficiently low for Johnson to say he has cleared it and we should all move on. Meanwhile his supporters, and even some of his opponents, are working out what serves them best: to push him out or let him stay. There are Tories looking at the calendar, asking if the local elections in May might be the moment. There are Labour folk wondering if it might help to have a weakened Johnson to punch at from now until the next general election. I understand all those calculations. But what does it mean for our system if he is allowed to hold on? What does it say about us? What, for example, would it say about our perennial brag that we are a society subject to the rule of law that the man who sets the rules is allowed to break them and break them so egregiously? I know it’s hard to keep track, but the party we were all focused on before the revelation of the basement disco was the one on 20 May 2020, when lockdown was still a relative novelty and most Britons were policing themselves with extraordinary self-discipline and self-sacrifice. Johnson says he went to that garden party, attended by his wife and some of her friends, where the gin and rosé flowed, and thought he was at a “work event”. No one in their right mind believes that is true. But if he stays in his job, we are saying that we accept it. What will it say about the supposedly unbreakable convention that a minister who lies to or misleads the House of Commons has to resign? Johnson was guilty of that on Wednesday with that “work event” nonsense, but it was hardly the first time. On 1 December last year, when grilled about whichever of the seemingly daily Downing Street parties had just been revealed, Johnson told MPs “all guidance was followed completely in No 10”. That was obviously untrue, and he must have known it was untrue because he had attended just such a rule-breaking party himself, back on 20 May 2020. Whatever elaborate get-out he tries to construct, we can all see the truth. If Johnson’s lie goes unpunished, a convention that evolved in order to allow the public to feel a basic level of trust in their government will have been shattered. That will damage our democratic health, but what will it mean for our literal health if Johnson is allowed to stay? Should there be a grave new variant of this disease, one that demands a return to full lockdown, it’s clear that he could not impose it. The country would simply refuse to take instruction from a man who so flagrantly laughed in their face last time. Indeed, it’s not clear any government could ever again impose such restrictions: the electorate might well conclude from this episode that all politicians and their officials are as hypocritical as the current gang inside No 10 and refuse to comply. That is a grim possibility. But with Johnson himself, it is certain. The country cannot navigate a public health crisis with this man at the helm. If that was true of Matt Hancock snogging his lover – a point Johnson conceded when he accepted Hancock’s resignation – then it is a hundred times truer of him. Of course, there were multiple reasons for Johnson to be removed, even before we knew he had turned Downing Street into the Studio 54 of Whitehall. On Wednesday, the high court found that the government’s use of a “VIP lane” for the allocation of lucrative PPE contracts during the first wave of the pandemic was unlawful, exposing to the light once more a pattern of behaviour that, were it spotted in any other country but ours, we would call corruption. What does it say about us that no one thinks for a minute that Johnson will be pushed out over any of that? There will be many now hoping that Sue Gray will ride to the rescue, that in calm, mandarin prose she will pronounce the prime minister unambiguously guilty. But it’s a fantasy, just as it was a fantasy to expect Robert Mueller to topple Donald Trump over collusion with Russia, or Robin Butler to remove Tony Blair over Iraq. I spoke to Lord Butler on Friday, and he reminded me that inquiries of this kind are not about declaring guilt or innocence, but solely about establishing the facts. He believes Gray will set out “what happened. It’s then for other people to reach judgments.” Those others will include the police, who will determine whether there is evidence of criminal activity. That’s their job, not Gray’s. Which is why it’s so dishonest of Downing Street to be briefing that the civil servant will rule on a question she has not been asked. Johnson’s fate will be decided not by her, but by politics: initially by MPs and, if necessary, by the people. Johnson’s former editor at the Telegraph, Max Hastings, once wrote that if Johnson, a man he believed “would not recognise truth if confronted by it in an identity parade” became prime minister, it would demonstrate that Britain was no longer “a serious country”. If we allow Johnson to stay as prime minister, given all that he’s done and all that we’ve seen, it would say something far, far worse.

1/15/2022,"An 18-year-old woman was raped by two masked men who approached her near a London overground station. The Metropolitan police have appealed for witnesses after the attack near Peckham Rye station.  The woman, who is being supported by specialist officers, was walking down an alleyway off Elm Grove when approached from behind by two men about 10.20pm, the Met police said. The two men were described by police as wearing dark clothing, both wearing gloves and face coverings. The men took the teenage victim a few yards away to Holly Grove where she was raped, the police said. A cordon remains in place. No arrests have yet been made. “Last night’s violent attack by two men on a woman near Peckham Rye station has appalled and upset our whole community,” the Labour leader of Southwark council, Kieron Williams, said on Twitter. “No woman should live in fear of male violence.” The crime comes just 106 days after Wayne Couzens was sentenced to life imprisonment for the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive who was abducted by the serving Met police officer while walking home, which provoked a national reckoning on male violence against women. Mandeer Kataria, a 30-year-old woman living nearby in Nunhead, said: “Male violence is endemic. This is a horrific incident and it’s honestly petrifying walking home alone in the dark right now – almost all women navigating cities know the feeling. “Since Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa, what safety measures have been considered around that exact area? The council and local police will need to answer this.” “The investigation into this incident is fast paced and ongoing and involves an extensive crime scene,” Det Supt Clair Kelland said in a statement. “We would like to speak to anyone who was in the area of Peckham Rye station between 10pm and 11pm last night who saw anything that might assist our investigation.” The report comes on the same weekend thousands are expected to gather across cities in Ireland and the UK after the murder of 23-year-old Ashling Murphy, who was killed in broad daylight while out for a run in Ireland on Wednesday. The killing has sparked an outpouring of grief and anger throughout Irish society. The incident happened near Rye Lane, a busy street of restaurants, shops and bars, but Southwark Police said multiple people had raised concerns that the area by the alleyway was not very safe, lacking CCTV and lighting. Southern Rail said Peckham Rye railway station would be closed until at least 10pm on Friday. Police told witnesses or anyone with any information to call 101 or tweet @MetCC quoting 240/14JAN. They said witnesses wishing to remain anonymous can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or visit crimestoppers-uk.org.",News/UK news,Police appeal for witnesses after woman raped near Peckham Rye station ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/14/police-appeal-for-witnesses-after-woman-raped-near-peckham-rye-station
