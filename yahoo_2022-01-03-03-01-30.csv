1/3/2022,"After decades of hard work, Americans hope to retire rich enough to spend decades more enjoying their retirement. But if you ask financial guru Suze Orman, the average person will fall very, very short. Instead of lasting decades, their savings will last about three years. Right now, the median savings held in retirement accounts in the U.S. is just $65,000, according to a Federal Reserve study released in September 2020. Meanwhile, the government says households led by seniors 65 or older spend an average of about $47,600 a year. If you want more than three good years, Orman's book The Ultimate Retirement Guide for 50+ offers five essential rules to ensure a comfortable retirement. If you haven’t already, Orman says it’s time to buckle down and take a deep look through your budget. Compare what you’re spending to what you’re saving. Trim the fat where you can and cut back on any unnecessary spending so you can allocate more to your retirement savings column. Do you own a home and are you planning to stay in it through retirement? Then Orman says you need to come up with a plan now to ensure you’ll have your mortgage fully paid off before you retire. Not sure how? A mortgage refinance at today's still historically low interest rates could save you hundreds of dollars a month and make it possible to get out from under your home loan sooner. You may have plenty of sentimental reasons to want to stay in your current home, but if it’s more space than you need and you can make money off of it, you may want to consider selling now. Not waiting until you have to sell the house makes sense, Orman says, because if you invest the profits now, you’ll accrue much more interest than if you waited another 10 or 15 years. “I don’t want you to wait till you’re 60 or 70 to sell this home,” she says. “I want you to downsize right now, so that you can start saving more money right now.” While some may hesitate to part with their family homes, a smaller space is easier to clean, cheaper to run, will cost you less in homeowners insurance and will be more accessible as you age. Financial experts typically recommend you have an emergency fund of at least three to six months’ worth of living expenses, Orman actually recommends you make that two or three years. Yes, three years’ worth of expenses in an emergency fund. Her reasoning is that if the market ever takes a downturn, you’re not going to want to be withdrawing from your retirement accounts until it bounces back. With a substantial emergency fund you’ll be able to get by until it’s once again safe to take out funds from your retirement account. If you need a little help setting up your emergency fund, you might turn to one of today's convenient online financial planners. To avoid paying tax when you take money out of your retirement account, Orman recommends you go for a Roth IRA account. “Later on in life, you want to be able to take that money out tax-free,” she explains. Because your contributions to a Roth account are made after tax, you won’t have to deal with deductions when you withdraw. Traditional IRAs, on the other hand, aren’t taxed when you make contributions, so you end up paying later. Most banks and brokerage firms offer these accounts. And if you’re not keen on making the big investment decisions yourself, you could open an IRA through a robo-advisor that will manage your retirement account for you. One popular robo-advisor will even help you grow your savings by investing your ""spare change"" from everyday purchases. Taking a “set it and forget it” approach to your investment portfolio rarely pays off. You have to regularly revisit your portfolio and make sure it’s still in line with your financial goals and timelines. Orman recommends either stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that pay dividends. So even if the market sees a downturn, your investments will still provide you some income. “If you happen to hit a patch where the market starts to go down, you want these stocks to still provide income for you,” she says. Check in with your financial adviser to ensure your balance of cash, stocks and bonds is right for your retirement goals. Try to keep your costs down by using an investing service that offers zero-commission trades. You might consider diversifying your investments by going way beyond stocks, maybe by putting some money into farmland or investing in fine art.

1/3/2022,"The stock market heads into 2022 at all-time highs. But according to famed investor Rick Rule, the new year could be filled with turbulence. “If you postpone a reckoning, you almost always have to pay back with interest,” Rule warned in a Q4 interview. The former president and CEO of Sprott U.S. Holdings believes that there will be serious consequences to all of the Fed’s easy money policies. “So the fact that you are able to skate through today and tomorrow and the day after on other people’s money means that ultimately, when society itself has to pay the bill, the bill is much, much, much larger.” The good news? Rule also suggested a few safe haven assets to protect yourself. One of them might be worth investing in with some of your extra cash. This might seem counterintuitive since inflation erodes the purchasing power of cash holdings. But even in this environment — where you don’t earn much from savings accounts — Rule still believes in having some cash on hand. “A circumstance where you have a dramatic reckoning, something like 2008 or 1987, or 1990, liquidity squeezes, when they occur in the market, take down the price of everything temporarily,” he explained to Stansberry Research. “Having cash gives you the tools and the courage to take advantage of that circumstance rather than being taken advantage of.” In other words, cash acts as dry gunpowder, allowing investors to capitalize on opportunities if and when things take a dramatic turn south. This is an obvious one. Given all of the Fed’s money printing, Rule pointed out the importance of owning gold and silver. And the nice part? You don’t need to own too much of it. “If you have a circumstance where the fiat goes to hell in a handbasket, the upside you get in your gold and silver means that a small insurance premium, which is to say a small holding in physical gold and silver, offsets a very large deterioration in the purchasing power of your fiat currency.” “So absolutely save part of your wealth in gold and silver,” Rule stressed. Don’t forget: There are also mining companies that are well-positioned for a precious metals boom. For instance, Wheaton Precious Metals, Pan American Silver, and Coeur Mining tend to do well with rising silver prices. Meanwhile Barrick Gold, Newmont, and Freeport-McMoRan could deliver serious returns in a gold rally. And these days, you can build your own safe-haven portfolio just by using your spare pennies. Real estate is another classic hedge against rising inflation and interest rates. But Rule stated that “the only sector” where he’s increasing his personal exposure to real estate is high-quality farmland — specifically in the Upper Midwest of the U.S. “To the extent that I can buy very high-quality farmland in the U.S. Upper Midwest, I’m doing that very aggressively,” he said. More and more investors have warmed up to the idea of farmland, and for a good reason: No matter what the economy does, people will still need to eat. As an intrinsically valuable asset, farmland can be an ideal hedge because it has little correlation with the ups and downs of the stock market. Between 1992 and 2020, U.S. farmland returned an average of 11% per year. Over the same time frame, the S&P 500 returned only 8%. And these days, you don’t need to get your hands dirty to get a piece of the action. New platforms allow you to invest in U.S. farmland by taking a stake in the farm of your choice. You’ll earn cash income from the leasing fees and crop sales — and any long-term appreciation on top of that. If you like assets that are not subject to the ups and downs of the stock market — but can also act as a hedge against inflation — there’s one more to consider: fine art. Contemporary artwork has outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% over the past 25 years, according to the Citi Global Art Market chart. And it’s becoming a popular way to diversify because it’s a real physical asset with little correlation to the stock market. On a scale of -1 to +1, with 0 representing no link at all, Citi found the correlation between contemporary art and the S&P 500 was just 0.12 during the past 25 years. Investing in art by the likes of Banksy and Andy Warhol used to be an option only for the ultrarich, like Rule. But with a new investing platform, you can invest in iconic artworks just like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates do. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.
