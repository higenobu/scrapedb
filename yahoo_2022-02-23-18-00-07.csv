2/23/2022,"AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — A team of Jordanian and French archaeologists said Tuesday that it had found a roughly 9,000-year-old shrine at a remote Neolithic site in Jordan’s eastern desert. The ritual complex was found in a Neolithic campsite near large structures known as “desert kites,"" or mass traps that are believed to have been used to corral wild gazelles for slaughter. Such traps consist of two or more long stone walls converging toward an enclosure and are found scattered across the deserts of the Middle East. “The site is unique, first because of its preservation state,"" said Jordanian archaeologist Wael Abu-Azziza, co-director of the project. “It's 9,000 years old and everything was almost intact.” Within the shrine were two carved standing stones bearing anthropomorphic figures, one accompanied by a representation of the “desert kite,” as well as an altar, hearth, marine shells and miniature model of the gazelle trap. The researchers said in a statement that the shrine “sheds an entire new light on the symbolism, artistic expression as well as spiritual culture of these hitherto unknown Neolithic populations.” The proximity of the site to the traps suggests the inhabitants were specialized hunters and that the traps were “the center of their cultural, economic and even symbolic life in this marginal zone,"" the statement said. The team included archaeologists from Jordan’s Al Hussein Bin Talal University and the French Institute of the Near East. The site was excavated during the most recent digging season in 2021.",Science/Associated Press,"Archaeologists find 9,000-year-old shrine in Jordan desert",https://news.yahoo.com/archaeologists-9-000-old-shrine-195231885.html
2/23/2022,"Vladimir Putin convened an unscheduled meeting of Russia's Security Council on Monday. The Kremlin said the meeting was prerecorded, after a minister's watch showed a different time. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's press secretary, said recording meetings in advance wasn't unusual. The Kremlin said a dramatic Security Council meeting on Ukraine was recorded in advance, after people realized a minister's watch showed the wrong time. Amid rising tensions with Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin convened an unscheduled meeting with his country's top security officials at the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow on Monday. The meeting was broadcast at 5 p.m. Moscow time, but a watch on the wrist of Russian Minister of Defence Sergey Shoygu — who spoke 47 minutes into the meeting — showed it was 12:47 p.m. instead, prompting speculation about whether the meeting was live or recorded. Although the meeting was announced unexpectedly, the Kremlin didn't specify whether it was live. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's press secretary, confirmed on Tuesday that the meeting was recorded in advance and that ""certain nuances were not broadcast,"" the state-run RIA news agency reported. He insisted that prerecording meetings wasn't unusual. Hours after the meeting, Putin delivered a speech in which he announced that Russia would recognize two separatist regions — the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic — as independent states. Late on Monday, Russia ordered troops into those regions, saying it did so for peacekeeping reasons. The move drew swift condemnation from the West. The White House announced sanctions on the regions shortly after, and the UK confirmed on Tuesday that it would launch a ""first barrage"" of sanctions against Russia. Germany also said it would scrap plans for the Nord Stream II gas pipeline.
