5/2/2022,"Today’s puzzle appeared in last year’s British Mathematical Olympiad (BMO), a competition taken by almost 2,000 school pupils in the UK. The BMO is the top national maths contest for pre-university students, and is part of the selection process for the British team at the International Mathematical Olympiad and the European Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad. Today’s question was one of the easier ones on last year’s paper. It was attempted by more than 90 per cent of entrants, and about 1 in 3 got full marks. Your serve… Ping pong percentages Arun and Disha played several games of table tennis. At five points during the day, Arun calculated the percentage of the games played so far that he had won. The results of these calculations were exactly 30 per cent, exactly 40 per cent, exactly 50 per cent, exactly 60 per cent and exactly 70 per cent, but not necessarily in that order. What is the smallest possible number of games they played? Here’s a hint (that wasn’t given to the BMO contestants.) Arun wins one of the first two games. I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the solution. Meanwhile, NO SPOILERS! As mentioned above, the BMO is part of the process that selects the UK’s six-person team for the International Mathematical Olympiad (which this year takes place in July in Oslo) and the four-person team for the European Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad (EGMO), which took place in Hungary last month. EGMO aims to increase female participation in the otherwise extremely male-dominated world of maths olympiads, and despite its name attracts teams from across the globe. In Hungary, the UK came 14th out of a total of 57 that took part. (Top of the rankings were USA, Peru, Australia, Romania and Bulgaria.) The UK team’s star member, Eleanor MacGillivray, who attends King’s Ely school, was the highest-scoring European contestant. Well done Eleanor!

5/2/2022,"Keir Starmer’s Labour should mirror the consistency of messaging and positive vision used by the party ahead of Tony Blair’s first election win 25 years ago, a report has said, while stressing that it is not enough to simply borrow from the past. The document, Lessons from a Landslide, says particular challenges Labour must tackle include preparing for a possible hung parliament, and outlining a longer-term narrative for change. Written by political historian Anthony Broxton along with Labour in Communications, a network of party supporters in the media and PR industries, the study’s recommendations include some direct echoes of Blair-era tactics. One is simplicity and consistency in message, with the report arguing this “works as much as it did 25 years ago”, pointing to the contrast between Boris Johnson’s ubiquitous “Get Brexit done” 2019 slogan and the several used then by Labour. Another recommendation was to engage with a hostile right wing press: “The idea of a crisis in Conservatism, which is beginning to develop in the media, can build into a more substantial argument about Labour’s call for change.” More specifically to Starmer, the study said a key to Labour’s success would be “whether he can neutralise the inevitable criticism that the party is still part of the ‘London remainer elite’”. While Starmer has sought to reposition Labour as a more overtly patriotic force, the next challenge would be “to move beyond the flags and demonstrate to the British public why Labour values are British values on a more consistent and impactful basis”, it added. Two of the most important elements would be to enter an election with a clear view on what might happen in a hung parliament, to deal with “inevitable attacks” that Labour will ally with Liberal Democrats and SNP to reverse Brexit; and to offer a broader vision of change. “By [the general election in] 2024, single issues such as Partygate will have long faded from view, however, the theme of Johnson’s leadership, and the consequences of his governance, will remain,” the report said. “Over the next few years, Labour’s task is to turn that narrative into a powerful policy platform that meets the challenges of today rather than those of 25 years ago.” In an introduction to the report, Alastair Campbell, who was Blair’s press secretary, said that as well as focusing on government failings, Starmer should “show the difference a Labour government can make”. “Labour, their MPs keep telling me, have lots of policies, but the public don’t know what they are,” he said. “You can’t blame the public for that. And though the media is a massive barrier, you can’t blame them either. Labour have to communicate relentlessly the difference they would make.” A party source said there was already a rigorous and settled communications operation, and that Starmer and his aides regularly liaise with media organisations from the right as well as the left.",News/Politics,"Labour messaging should be clear, consistent and positive, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/02/labour-messaging-should-be-clear-consistent-and-positive-report-says
5/2/2022,"Garmin’s latest rugged solar-powered smartwatch, the Instinct 2, promises unlimited battery life. You just have to stay in the sun. Looking more like a rugged digital watch such as Casio’s legendary G-Shock than an Apple or Samsung smartwatch, the Garmin feels made to take a beating with its monochrome screen, physical buttons and sturdy body. It costs from £299.99 ($349.99/A$549) and comes in various versions such as one for surfing and even one for professional truck drivers. But it is the solar charging models, costing £389.99, that promise never to need to be plugged in for power. Underneath the rugged exterior is Garmin’s smartwatch tech, featuring market-leading sport, health and location-tracking. It has smartphone connectivity for notifications, alerts and syncing your data via the Connect app on an Android or iPhone. It is very similar to many other Garmin sport watches, but what sets the Instinct 2 apart is its promise of incredible battery life even without the power of the sun. The standard 45mm model without solar will last up to 28 days used as a general smartwatch, which is 10 days longer than the already impressive Fenix 7 and about 14 times longer than an Apple Watch. The solar version, which charges using a transparent “power glass” covering the screen and panels around the edge of the display, promises to keep the battery topped up for essentially unlimited battery life as long as you spend at least three hours in direct sunlight (50,000 lux of light). How realistic that is depends on your day-to-day activities. On a sunny winter’s day in London the watch received 40,000 lux of direct sunlight through a window, so if you spend your days outside rather than locked in an office it seems more than feasible. For mainly indoor usage during winter without much in the way of solar charging, the watch lasted about 15 days between charges, including five hours of workout-tracking. I wore it 24 hours a day with message alerts, heart rate, stress, calories, general activity and health monitoring, plus sleep and blood oxygen (SpO2) tracking overnight. Turning off the Sp02 sensor added days to the life as did limiting workouts. The solar charging would add at least 24 hours battery for each sunny spring day spent outside, too. Screen: monochrome transflective MIP LCD Case size: 40 or 45mm Case thickness: 13.3 to 14.5mm Band size: standard 20 or 22mm quick fit Weight: 42 to 53g Water resistance: 100 metres (10ATM) Sensors: GNSS (GPS, Glonass, Galileo), compass, thermometer, heart rate, pulse Ox Connectivity: Bluetooth, ANT+ Of course its battery prowess comes at the cost of features on fancier-looking Garmin watches such as the Fenix 7 or rivals like the Apple Watch. The Instinct 2 lacks a touchscreen, though the button-based interface is fast and logical. It lacks the new high-accuracy multi-band GPS tracking technology, but still has an altimeter, barometer and compass. The biggest missing features are offline music playback, such as Spotify without having to use your phone, and offline maps. It can plot breadcrumb trails of where you have been on an activity to help you get back to the start, guide you in the direction of points of interest and even measure the area of a space by walking its perimeter, but it has no maps available. The watch tracks a vast number of activities including various forms of running, walking, cycling, swimming, strength, cardio, Hiit and more exotic ones such as paddle boarding, hunting, fishing, backcountry skiing and bouldering. Some activities are restricted to special versions of the watch, such as the jumpmaster mode for skydiving being only available on the “tactical edition”, surfing and tide information on the “surf edition” and the truck-driver tools on the “dēzl edition” to plan breaks and workouts. Only the solar models have Garmin Pay for contactless payments too, which supports few UK banks but is useful in emergencies when out on excursions without a credit card or phone. On the health front, it has Garmin’s excellent body battery, which makes it easy to understand the impact of sleep, activity and rest on your day, plus stress tracking, abnormal heart rate alerts, daily workout suggestions, Vo2 Max fitness measurement and recovery estimation after exercise and many other features. All the activity and health information the watch collects is sent via Bluetooth to the excellent Garmin Connect app on your phone, within which you can pore over mountains of data, graphs and insights. Plus you can connect it straight to social networks such as Strava. The Garmin Instinct 2 comes in two sizes and various models, starting at £299.99 ($349.99/A$549) for the standard version or £389.99 ($449.99/A$699) with solar charging. For comparison, the Garmin Forerunner 55 costs £149.99, Venu 2 costs from £349.99, Fenix 7 costs from £599.99, Epix costs from £799.99, the Coros Apex costs £299.99 and the Polar Grit X costs £369. The Instinct 2 Solar is the closest model so far to what is the holy grail of smartwatch makers – a watch which you never have to plug into the charger. It looks and feels more like a traditional digital watch, but is backed by Garmin’s comprehensive activity and general health tracking, and simple smartphone notifications. It lacks a few bells and whistles you get with less rugged smartwatch rivals, such as voice assistants, maps, offline music or ECG (heart rhythm) measurement, but its features will probably be more than enough for those not looking for an Apple Watch or similar. If you spend long enough each day in the sun or bright environments you may never need to charge it. For those of us more often confined to the indoors, it’ll still last close to a month or longer with some less necessary features disabled. The Instinct 2 is expensive and certainly not for everyone, but if you’re an outdoors person or looking for a smarter health-tracking version of a digital watch, the Garmin is great. Pros: potentially unlimited battery life with solar charging, tracks lots of activities and health metrics, cross-platform phone notifications, 100m water resistance, durable design, choice of colours and versions. Cons: expensive, no offline music or maps, limited smartwatch features compared with Apple or Samsung, no voice control, screen basic compared to OLED or other Garmins.

5/2/2022,"Instead of rushing out to buy new cleaning products, check for almost-empty bottles squirrelled away at the back of your sink cupboard that you can use up. You may have other supplies that can be repurposed. Bicarbonate of soda and vinegar are favourites with cleaners, and can be used to freshen up drains or to clean windows or a mattress, among other tasks. Steve Payne, of the bed retailer Sleep and Snooze, says if you are looking to clean a mattress, first vacuum it, then spritz it with white vinegar. “Don’t worry about the slight vinegar smell – this will disappear as it dries,” he says. “Next, get a sieve and use it to sprinkle a fine layer of baking soda over the mattress. You want the whole surface of the mattress to be covered. Leave the baking soda and the vinegar to get to work soaking up any musty odours. After an hour or two, you can vacuum up all the baking soda, making sure you get into all the crevices of the mattress.” Tina Simpson, at Triton Showers, advises using the same two items to give a mouldy shower curtain a deep clean. “Add washing detergent and half a cup of bicarbonate of soda to the drawer and commence a 30-degree wash, stopping before the rinse cycle,” she says. “At this point, add half a cup of vinegar to the detergent drawer and commence a final rinse, before hanging back up in your shower to dry.” The bathroom retailer Drench suggests that shaving foam doesn’t need to be saved for faces: use it to clean mirrors, streak-free – and with no fogging later. It can also be used on carpet stains as well as glass hobs: “Try covering the electric hob in shaving foam and leave for 15 minutes. Wipe away and the grime will be gone.” When extolling the virtues of these alternatives, people sometimes say they don’t have “harsh chemicals” like purpose-made cleaning products, but they would not work if they didn’t. Abigail Yearley, a spokesperson for the TopCashback website, says you can clean a microwave or oven more easily “by popping some lemon rinds or juice into a bowl (or baking tray, if cleaning the oven) of water. Heat your appliances and then leave the receptacle to cool. This will help to remove stains (and ease the elbow grease).” Although lemons can be used elsewhere, “their citric acid can corrode metal – so use with care”, Yearly warns. Other cleaning alternatives also come with a similar warning. While some people suggest that vinegar can be used to deep-clean a dishwasher, it is acidic and can damage rubber seals and other parts. Which? has a guide to things you should not clean with vinegar, which includes dishwashers along with mirrors and granite or stone kitchen worktops. Do some research if you are unsure, rather than risking an expensive mistake. Throwing open the windows can get rid of musty smells and make your home feel fresher for free. If you have outdoor space, dry your laundry there – the sun will help to bleach your whites, at no cost. Airing duvets and pillows outside can refresh them without the need for a wash. “People always jump to thinking ‘I must buy storage solutions,’ because that’s the fun part, but you don’t need to,” says Lizzie Grant, a professional organiser and decluttering expert at the website Vinted. She suggests that you use “a shoe box, a [mobile] phone box, tins – anything where you can group things together so you know everything has a home”. Don’t buy a label-maker, she says, as any stickers will do. You could make boxes more attractive by decorating with scraps of paper or fabric. Repurpose items: an old fruit crate could be used as a tray, while a wheelie suitcase with a broken handle could be used for under-bed storage. Vacuum storage is not something you can make, but it will help you maximise the space in your home, so it could prove a good investment. Shop around before you buy big-ticket items such as a vacuum cleaner or power washer. According to the cost comparison website PriceSpy, prices for cleaning equipment tend to be competitive between now and June, so you may get a good deal. Its site lets you compare prices on specific makes and models from a large number of retailers. If you are an Amazon user, CamelCamelCamel shows you the price history of items on the site, so you can see how today’s offer compares. It also lets you sign up for an alert if the cost of an item is cut. Items such as carpet cleaners are unlikely to be worth the money or space – but they are commonly available for hire. RugDoctor cleaners cost from £24.99 a day, while HSS is charging from just under £21 for the same period. If you don’t have many carpets to clean, you could team up with a friend. A Library of Things will usually carry this kind of item – there are several in London and around the country. In London, a steam cleaner is available to hire for £9.50 a day, plus a small membership fee. Or you could see whether a friend or neighbour has a machine you can borrow. Try your neighbourhood page on social media, or ask a local WhatsApp group if you are part one. If you repay them with a nice box of chocolates or similar, you will still have saved money. You will get more efficient use from appliances, and they will last for longer, if you look after them. With your vacuum cleaner, look after the filter. If it is washable, give it a clean and you should find there is more suction power when you put it back. If the machine has a bag, do not let it get completely full before you change it. Clean out your dishwasher filter – again, it just needs washing in hot water and a bit of washing-up liquid. If the machine smells, give it a hot wash either empty with a bought cleaner, or when you are doing the dishes. If you live in a hard water area, descaling your washing machine will help it work for longer and more efficiently. For this you will need to buy a specialist product. Tafari Smith, head of savings at RCI Bank, suggests that you also vacuum refrigerator coils and de-lint the tumble dryer, if you have one, and de-ice the freezer. “This simple maintenance saves a considerable amount of money on water and energy bills, while preventing unnecessary repair costs in the future,” he says. You may be able to offset the cost of anything you need to buy by selling off some of the things you no longer want. For clothes, eBay, Gumtree and Vinted are among the options, while for old books, CDs, DVDs and games, musicMagpie is another site to check out. Clothes that are not good enough to be sold or given to charity could be repurposed: old T-shirts can be cut up for dusters, or the fabric used to decorate boxes for storage.",Lifestyle/Money,How to spring clean and declutter your home for less,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/02/how-spring-clean-home-for-less-household-tips
5/2/2022,"It is the social scientist’s dream: to outdo Adam Smith, Max Weber and Karl Marx and come up with a unifying theory of why society has developed as it has, where it is going next and how its wrongs can be righted. At times, reading Oded Galor’s upbeat book I thought he had cracked it, taken aback by his imagination and verve. For example, it is obvious once pointed out that agricultural economies reliant on the plough necessarily diminish women’s role in wider economic and social life because ploughs need male muscle, which leads to women taking over household duties rather than sharing duties in fields where soil is easier to work. What Galor shows is that this gendered division of labour persists over generations, even in countries to which plough-using peoples migrate. He is nothing if not original. But ultimately, achieving the dream of explaining everything is too big an ask, even for an economist of Galor’s range. He is so devoted to the hidden long-run pulses that determine our destinies – geography, climate, diversity, the capacity to be future-oriented, the role of education, the rights and wrongs of Malthusian economics – that he neglects what is in full view. An account that purports to describe humanity’s journey without getting to grips with why some innovations – such as the three-masted sailing ship, printing press or computer – change civilisation while others are more ordinary, can only be incomplete. These “general-purpose technologies” not only have diverse origins, as he argues, but also require an extraordinary interplay between state funding, large markets, cultural readiness and capitalist organisation to get off the ground. The printing press was not only the result of Gutenberg living on the Rhine, where trade routes from various regions brought invention and ideas: it also needed Protestant princes to fund the prototypes and buy the presses, and then an exploding, religiously driven appetite for published bibles, hymns and sermons in Reformation Europe. Indeed Galor devotes little of his book to capitalism, the structure of states and the consequent dynamic interdependence between the public and private sectors, or the importance of Enlightenment values that unleashed notions of the public sphere and rule of law. These are gigantic omissions. His is a technocratic journey full of illuminating graphs, but strangely bloodless and neglectful of political economy in explaining humanity’s journey. Yet great sections of Galor’s book are to be applauded. The economist Thomas Malthus, now dismissed by mainstream economics as an interesting crank, is resurrected by Galor as the man who correctly saw that for millennia humanity had been trapped by its own fertility into subsistence, starvation and famine. As soon as material matters improved, the birthrate went up, so did the population, and the pressure on food resources exploded – returning humanity to starvation. Incredibly, wages demonstrated these Malthusian effects, buying broadly the same amount of food from the Assyrian empire, through the Romans and right up to the eve of the Industrial Revolution. What broke the Malthusian armlock on humanity’s destiny, argues Galor, is the gradual quickening in the introduction of technologies that required mass education for their successful implementation. This triggered a virtuous circle of more innovation, more investment in education, more need to invest in the quality of children rather than quantity, so that birthrates declined sufficiently to allow living standards and life expectancy to rise. Because it was now rational to invest in children’s education rather than get them working, child labour and exploitation fell away. Above all he shows how cultural attitudes persist long after whatever concatenation of events brought them into being, so that countries and cultures that get ahead tend to stay ahead. He is scathing about the shock programmes of market liberalisation that accompanied the “Washington consensus”, ignorant of these persistent traits. Effective market economies can’t be built spontaneously in cultures that are hostile to the very conception. Yet his optimism about humanity shines through – prize its diversity, commit to educate its children and they will find their way to innovate and create a culture of growth. It’s a great way to look at the world, but a healthy recognition that power, capitalism, finance, the existence and structure of states and public philosophies – some right, some wrong – are all part of the brew would have made his account more realistic. Sad to say they would also have made it less optimistic. Humanity, as Kant said, is made of crooked timber from which nothing entirely straight can be made. Galor’s book would have been the stronger had he leavened his sunshine with some shadows.

5/2/2022,"Well powder my arse and call me a baby because, friends, I am addicted to stories. I can barely function without a podcast, the radio or an audiobook accompanying my actions. Not music, not silence; just talking. Temporarily misplacing my headphones this week (they turned up in a bowl of potatoes) made me realise quite how dependent I have become on the human voice for company, comfort and concentration. An account of a serial killer while you clean your hob? Why not. A condensed audio version of a literary classic while you run 5km? Sure. An intricate chat about favourite dinners while you shave your legs? Go on then. Falling asleep every night to the autobiography of Malcolm X? In my case, absolutely. Is this hunger for recorded speech a result of our atomised, lonely little lives, in which you can go hours, perhaps days, without the tangible, audible contact of another living person? Or is my compulsion towards human chatter a hangover from a childhood spent listening to books on cassette and the ever-present gurgling of the radio beside the oven? It’s certainly true that last year, while doing my tax return, I listened to the very same Roald Dahl audiobooks I fell asleep to as a child. Somehow, the Theatre Collection performances of Matilda, The Witches and Fantastic Mr Fox got me through the anxiety-inducing hellfire of my expenses. This year, I might try The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian and see if they have the same balm-like effect. Ironically, the very week in which I lost my headphones, I spent three days sitting in a small, soundproof booth, recording the audiobook of my first novel. For 15 happy hours, I had nothing to do but speak. And so, the addict has become the dealer. The baby has learned to talk.  Nell Frizzell is the author of The Panic Years, published by Bantam Press.

5/2/2022,"A gregarious Florida alligator seemingly could not wait for a family’s birthday party to begin, so it slipped into a garage where supplies were being stored and chugged down a slab of Diet Coke. The uninvited guest surprised Naples homeowners Karyn and Jamie Dobson when they opened the connecting door from their house after hearing a crash, WINK News reported. “I open the door about a quarter way, peek my head in, and there’s the alligator,” Jamie Dobson said. He said the 8ft crocodilian was backing away, with froth from the cans all over the floor. The couple had purchased several slabs of sodas for Karyn Dobson’s party a few days later. “There was Diet Coke spewing everywhere because the gator tore open the box [and] had a few cans, probably thought it was beer maybe,” she said. “We were all standing there like a scaredy cat. People have sent me texts and emails … they have all these comments [like] ‘What a great birthday present.’” The alligator is believed to have sneaked in after the couple returned from walking their dog and neglected to close the garage door. The Dobsons said they had recently moved to the area from Chicago and were not aware of the danger of leaving the garage door open. “[It’s] something [that being] from the midwest I really haven’t experienced before,” Jamie Dobson said. A trapper caught the alligator and relocated it to a non-residential area. Alligator encounters in built-up communities are more frequent during mating season, which began in April and lasts until June as the reptiles emerge from the swamps and go looking for a partner. Wildlife officials say they rarely pose a direct threat to humans. “Alligators seldom bite people for reasons other than food,” the Florida Fish and Wildlife commission says in its human-alligator incidents fact sheet, which notes the state has a “healthy” population of about 1.3m of the reptiles. “Female alligators may protect their nests by hissing and opening their mouths to frighten intruders but rarely bite people. Alligator bites are most likely to occur in or around water.”",News/US news,Gator aid: Florida couple call for help after can-do alligator drinks Diet Cokes,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/02/florida-alligator-drinks-diet-coke

5/2/2022,"Q I am struggling to work out what capitals gains tax I will owe on the sale of a property. I bought it in April 2007 for £250,000 and it was my only property. It was my main residence from April 2007 until Dec 2013. I then rented out half of the flat while I still lived there – from Jan 2014 until December 2015. In January 2016 I moved out and let the whole property, as I married and bought a house with my wife. If I sell the property for £400,000 in May this year what will I owe? I understand how to calculate private residence relief for the period I lived in it by myself, but I’m not sure if I am also entitled for lettings relief for the two years I shared the property with the tenant – and if so, how to calculate it. The examples I see only seem to have the property fully rented, or shared – and never a mix as I have had. Can you help?TR A Yes I can, but largely thanks to this very helpful example from Which? that explains how lettings relief is calculated since the rules changed in April 2020. Before then, lettings relief was available on the capital gain of a property that had previously been the owner’s home but was subsequently let. Since April 2020 – as you are clearly aware – lettings relief is available only if the owner lived in the property with the tenants so no longer where tenants are the sole occupiers. What hasn’t changed is the need to calculate how much private residence relief you are entitled to before you can see how much lettings relief you get. For you, you will get private residence relief on 50% of the gain (81 months of sole occupation plus nine months divided by 180 months of ownership). Assuming a total gain of £150,000 (£400,000 minus £250,000) – £75,000 of that will not attract capital gains tax (CGT). A further 8% of the gain will be tax free because of lettings relief (24 months of letting minus nine months divided by 180 months of ownership). So the total amount of the gain which will be tax free is £87,000 leaving £63,000 liable to tax but £50,700 after knocking off your annual CGT allowance of £12,300 (assuming that you haven’t already used it up in the 2022-23 tax year). The amount of tax you pay depends on which tax bracket you are in once the taxable gain is added to your taxable income. If that means you are a basic-rate taxpayer, the tax rate is 18% but if you are a higher-rate taxpayer, it is 28%. Whatever the rate, the tax will have to be paid within 60 days of selling – or otherwise disposing of – the property.",Lifestyle/Money,How much CGT should I pay on a flat that I both lived in and rented out?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/02/how-much-cgt-should-i-pay-on-a-flat-that-i-both-lived-in-and-rented-out
5/2/2022,"Last summer we moved house from a Taylor Wimpey home we had lived in since it was built. Our entire move was beset by disasters, but while most were eventually resolved, one problem continues. The property company that manages our old house – a firm called FirstPort – won’t accept that we have moved out. As part of the move we had to pay £200 for a management pack to transfer our property to the new owners. This we duly did. Soon after we had moved in to our new house I cancelled the direct debit to FirstPort for our service charges. I have written and phoned to confirm we have moved. Despite this I continue to get emails from the company, and have received the invoice for this year’s bill. I rang again, and was told that we would be removed. The property transfer team got in touch to tell me that the buyers’ solicitors needed to send over some paperwork. I got in touch but FirstPort staff claim they still haven’t received it. They’ve also said they will not accept a Land Registry title change as proof we have moved. The buyers of our house completed the forms and are happy for the costs to shift to them, but FirstPort is refusing to engage with any method of sorting this out. Please help.AB, near Reading FirstPort says it offers “award-winning property management built around your home” but it also seems to have rather too many unhappy customers who are struggling to get someone to sort out admin problems. The online reviews of this firm show you are by no means alone in trying to get your management bills moved to the new occupier. Happily, the firm’s press team quickly got on the case and the transfer has now been recorded on its system. Hopefully that will be the last interaction you will have, and it should bring to end what sounded like a nightmare house move, with this just one of several other unrelated problems. A FirstPort spokesperson says: “We are sorry for the initial delay in resolving this, while we received and verified the relevant documentation from external parties. We look after 310,000 homes across England, Wales and Scotland, and while the majority of our reviews are positive, we continue to work hard to improve our service for all our residents.” We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

5/2/2022,"There were a couple of days on his most recent course, Andy Walters admits, “when I thought: ‘Am I too old for this?’ Then, the next day, I was fine. I was the oldest guy who passed, so that was gratifying.” He has just taken a further qualification as a ski instructor, reaching a level that enables him to teach almost anywhere, four years after embarking on this new direction at the age of 60. Walters had always had a fascination with skiing, even though he was born in Kuwait, a place “as snowless as you can get”. His father was a civil engineer, his mother, a physiotherapist from the Isle of Bute, the Scottish island where Walters now lives. He and his wife moved there 25 years ago and bought a run-down hotel, which they run as a self-catered holiday house. They live in a flat alongside, handing over the keys to guests on a Friday, “so we’re sort of retired, and it gives me more time to do the things I want to do”. It’s why Walters thought he might enjoy teaching people to ski. He had, after all, he says with a smile, enjoyed the breadmaking classes he used to run. “I like teaching people things,” he says. When he was a child, Walters’s family moved back to the UK, and he first skied at 11 on a school trip to Austria. “We were allowed to go up the mountain on the second day and I remember, with a friend, being so scared of skiing down that we actually walked down,” he says. Yet it didn’t put him off. Their teacher started organising Sunday trips to Glenshee, the skiing area in the Highlands, and Walters became part of the school’s ski team (consisting of just him and another boy). In his 20s, Walters moved to Brighton and worked as a computer programmer in London, while also working on Saturdays in a ski shop. He was offered a full-time job there, and decided to take it. Later, he and a friend worked as location caterers, largely for BBC productions. Between that and raising three daughters, Walters didn’t ski for about 20 years. “It wasn’t until we moved to Scotland and I was closer to some of the resorts that I picked it up again.” Once he had taken the week-long instructor course in the Cairngorms – followed by further training – he wasn’t sure there would be an easy route into work. Then he spotted a plea on Facebook from a company that teaches children to ski, for someone to replace one of their instructors who had injured herself. Three days later, Walters arrived in Switzerland. “I was thinking: ‘This is going to be awful, because I’ll be this old guy,’” he says. But he wasn’t even the oldest instructor – there was one in his early 70s. It went so well that, by the second day, his group of 11- and 12-year-olds were skiing down easy runs. He now regularly works with the company, teaching groups of children during their school holidays. He is pretty fit, he says, and being a 64-year-old ski instructor isn’t too tiring, although, he adds: “You can find yourself out of breath sometimes if you’re following a 20-year-old down a run and they refuse to stop. The thing about skiing is, if your technique is quite good, it’s fairly efficient, so you don’t tend to over-exert yourself.” There is “very little ageism”, he says, within the instructor world, where there is a diverse range of ages – on his recent course, the youngest was 16, and the oldest was in his 70s (although he didn’t finish it). When you’re teaching beginners “you spend most of your time dealing with people skiing fairly slowly. You’re not trying to teach people to go as fast as possible – you’re trying to teach them how to ski with control, reduce speed, get down the mountain without killing themselves.” Three years ago, Walters broke his pelvis. “I had a sort of freak slip sideways and landed on my hipbone on a very hard piste, which was enough to put me in hospital for four days, and then on crutches for three months. When you get to your 60s, everything can be a potential problem, but I skied the next year and it was fine.” He doesn’t think the accident – or its impact – was age-related, he was just unlucky. “It’s knees that generally go first but, so far, fingers crossed …” What has this change of life given him? “Great friends,” he says. “I’ve met a lot of really interesting people, and skied with them.” It has been fun to teach children, he says, and see them progress. “It’s something I didn’t anticipate I would do this late. I like to keep myself interested, and I think it keeps me feeling young.” Sometimes he compares himself with an instructor, 20 years his junior, who has become a good friend “and think maybe I should have done it at 40, but I didn’t have the confidence, I didn’t think I could actually achieve it. Then for some reason, four years ago, I thought: ‘Maybe I can.’” Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",Lifestyle/Life and style,A new start after 60. ‘I’m a 64-year-old ski instructor – and it keeps me feeling young’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/02/a-new-start-after-60-64-year-old-ski-instructor-young-retired-andy-walters
5/2/2022,"Kahoder Sabra grins as he looks out at the media throng surrounding prime minister Scott Morrison at Eid prayers in Parramatta park on Monday morning. Morrison is attending the Eid prayer, and Sabra thinks recognition of the Muslim community’s electoral influence has been long overdue. “I think it’s magnificent,” he says. “The Muslim vote does count.” “Whether we like it or not, he’s our prime minister. And he’s coming to have a chat with the people. So it means a lot to us; it means we are part of the community now.” Eid ul-Fitr marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan, and it’s the first time in recent history that it has coincided with an election campaign. Previous Eids have been attended by premiers, or state or local MPs, but Morrison is the first sitting prime minister to ever attend an Eid prayer. Morrison chose the Eid prayers held in Parramatta, one of the most marginal and diverse seats in the country. He wasn’t the only one – former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd was also there, as were candidates Andrew Charlton (Labor) and Maria Kovacic (Liberal), as well as the immigration minister, Alex Hawke. In his speech to the congregation, the prime minister compared the end of Ramadan, where Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset, to Australia’s “emergence” from the pandemic. “Breaking this fast is, I suppose, a little like what the country is now going through after two years of incredibly difficult times, as we’ve come through the pandemic. “Australia is like a rope with many different strands that weave together to make it incredibly strong. And I’m here with one of those important strands here today.” While many in attendance agree that Morrison’s presence is an attempt to win their votes, some welcome his recognition of the importance of their community. The 2016 census showed Islam was the second largest religion in Australia, with 2.6% of Australians identifying as Muslim, and the number expected to exponentially grow in the latest census. It makes the diverse community a powerful source of votes, and in Parramatta, held by Labor on a margin of 3.5%, they can make or break any campaign. “There are a lot of Muslim voters in Parramatta who usually go with the Liberals,” Sabra says. “But some might flip this year.” But while Morrison attracted a throng of worshippers, not everyone is enamoured by his presence. “He’s only here for the elections,” scoffs Mostafa, who does not want to use his surname. “All the dogs are here for their bones. It’s typical politics, that’s all it is. He doesn’t care about us, look at how western Sydney was treated during the pandemic.” “In all honesty, I’m not convinced by either party this year, I’m just going to go in and get my name ticked off. They are all the same.” Nashmiya Hammad says she is also not impressed with Morrison’s appearance, adding that she wants to see more substantial policy discussions. “I think it’s really annoying that he’s here. I don’t want to see him on Eid. I don’t want to be praying with him at the front.” “I don’t feel like he’s handling things very well, especially on things like climate change, where he should be doing more before it’s too late.” A sense of disengagement and disappointment in both Labor and the Liberals hung over the gathering, with many expressing dismay at their respective campaigns. Dr Ahmed Al-Omary says he feels the election campaign has been “overwhelming” so far, with little done to engage immigrant communities. “I arrived around eight years ago, and I just feel like more needs to be done to engage people like me. “I feel like we don’t know what they stand for. I think we need better education on their policies.” Rabi Tukhi says he doesn’t feel represented by either party. At 18, he will be voting for the first time; he says he feels Morrison’s presence is just a “political game”. “It’s all just politics. It was a nice and generous act to come today, but if I’m going to be honest, it’s all about the political games. He was here for the social media posts, really. “Both parties, at the end of the day, just want power.”",News/Australia news,‘Political games’ or welcome gesture?

5/2/2022,"Last month, at a parlor in West Hollywood, Emma Cooper got a tattoo of Marilyn Monroe’s face on the underside of her arm. The director of the new Netflix documentary The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes didn’t initially count herself among her subject’s fandom, just aware of the major building blocks in her movie-star mythology: white dress, blonde coiffure, beauty mark, natural sex-bomb charisma, undercurrent of psychological stress ending in tragedy. “But that’s the thing about Marilyn,” Cooper says. “She pulls you in.” “I did not think I’d end up having her as part of my body, but you become obsessed with her,” she tells the Guardian. “On my first research trip in Los Angeles, I went to see her grave and visit the Academy. While I was in town, I also met one of her biographers. They said, ‘Strap yourself in. You’re going to go mad for her.’ I thought, ‘Of course I won’t.’ Cut to me on Sunset Boulevard, getting this done.” The inked portrait isn’t a caricature of those distinguishing features; instead it’s winnowed down to uncolored outlines so minimal we may as well be looking at the screen idol’s bones. The instinct to do away with appearances and expose the foundations undergirding an image aptly matches the intent of her latest project, which favors fact-based reportage over thrall to Monroe’s dazzle. Cooper’s film joins investigative journalist Anthony Summers as he recounts the important points of his 1985 book Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe, its timeline and accompanying insights repackaged for a visual medium. He was the one who sold Cooper on the concept, convinced that she would also come to see the person behind the legacy of victimhood. “To me, Marilyn had always been a bit one-dimensional,” Cooper says. “By the end of this process, she’d become a much more real person to me, with more modernity as a woman than I’d ever seen in her.” In a crowded marketplace of Monroe biography, Cooper and Summers set their work apart by branding it with a shoe-leather true-crime angle. The film and its source material both eschew talking-head segments from experts or obsessives, relying on a cast of Monroe’s collaborators, confidantes, and closest loved ones. In the course of researching his book back in the 80s, Summers amassed a goldmine of audio recordings with firsthand eyewitnesses in the star’s orbit. Having scoured innumerable hours across hundreds of his tapes, archived at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Los Angeles, Cooper brings this audio to life via lip-synced reenactment, using actors in costume. “This is the last film about Marilyn Monroe exclusively populated by people who knew her, touched her life, felt her presence, really knew what it was like to be around her,” she says. The multitude of perspectives combine to form a prismatic view of a much-analyzed personality, already subject to constant public reappraisal and re-reappraisal. From the queen bee dumb blonde in Hollywood (said her All About Eve costar Celeste Holm, “I thought she was quite sweet and terribly dumb and my natural reaction was, ‘Whose girl is that?’”), she has been elevated to a silver screen saint martyred by a beastly tabloid media and the ravages of addiction. “The truth is somewhere in the middle,” Cooper says. “It almost always is.” She wanted to avoid the simplistic or salacious in chronicling a life beset by scandal and intrigue, and focused on the contents of Monroe’s character: the intellectual curiosity of the Method student, the passionate artistry of the actor who wowed greats like Billy Wilder and John Huston as her talents caught up to her innate charisma. “She was many things,” Cooper says. “She did have trauma, and it did affect her relationship, but she wasn’t a victim. She worked very hard on herself … The way she could sometimes show her vulnerability and sometimes hide it is so alluring. And we know that now as something that’s powerful about all women. But back then, we didn’t all have the freedom to explore that in ourselves the way Marilyn did.” Monroe remains a figure of such permanent fascination, commanding two documentaries and a biopic in 2022 alone, in part for all that’s universal about her rarefied circumstances. Though the spotlight shone more harshly on her than any other celebrity of her era, Cooper and countless other present-day women see an integral part of a shared experience in the outsized expectations heaped upon her. While wrestling with depression, insecurity, and barbiturate use, she had no choice but to maintain a facade of perfect glamour in her performances for the paparazzi. Though Cooper’s favorite Monroe film is The Seven Year Itch (“I quite like the send-up of male stereotypes in that film; Marilyn’s in on the joke”), she feels the most telling texts are the photographs that capture the bombshell mask and the angst it couldn’t fully cover. “The two archival pieces about her that I became obsessed with were, one, when she’s walking out of the Payne Whitney psychiatric clinic like it’s a restaurant or movie premiere even though she’d been held for three days. She ended up smashing a window, saying that she was being the mad person they all expected her to be. Joe DiMaggio ended up getting her out. It was the most extraordinary, awful time. For her to come out in full makeup and hair, it seems unbelievable. Half of me thinks it was horrible that she felt she had to present herself like this, and the other half is fucking amazed at her ability to do it.” She continues: “The second one is when they’re doing the announcement of her divorce, and she can’t stop the emotion from showing. She cries, and it’s hard to watch. You see an immense hurt over this failed relationship. Young women today can still connect to that, and to her. As recently as 20 years ago, people would’ve said she was all over the place, mad, hysterical. Now, I see this and think, ‘That’s just being a woman.’” Across its final half hour, the film’s primary-sourced approach builds to a close inspection of the murky circumstances surrounding Monroe’s death, and its rumored link to known paramours John and Robert Kennedy. Summers’ sleuthing confirmed that while conspiracy theories that suggest the suicide by overdose was a secretly ordered hit were fanciful fabrications, there was indeed some mucking-about with the official record to avoid negative PR for the Kennedys. It’s not quite the smoking gun a gawker might hope for; rather a comment on the continued societal impulse to treat Monroe’s existence like juicy gossip. “I’m constantly trying to find a line where we acknowledge conspiracy and try to unpick its strands,” Cooper says. “People might say there’s nothing new here, but I think this film is a useful resource.” She hopes that others can receive her film as a jumping-off point for a deepened appreciation of and respect for Monroe, setting them on the same track that landed a once-indifferent Cooper under the tattoo artist’s needle. It doesn’t take much to show skeptics of the substance in a woman historically prized as a gorgeous sob story how painfully human she really was. After all, as Cooper knows all too well, pulling us in has always been Marilyn’s superpower. “Any success in this film is a younger generation getting to know her, and getting a clearer idea of her than the ones that came before,” Cooper says. “They can take comfort in recognizing things they’ve gone through in their own lives happening to one of the most famous people of all time. It’s reassuring. I don’t mean to sound hokey.” The Mystery of Marilyn Monroe: The Unheard Tapes is available on Netflix now",Arts/Film,‘You become obsessed with her’: the enduring fascination with Marilyn Monroe,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/02/mystery-marilyn-monroe-unheard-tapes-documentary
