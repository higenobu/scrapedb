3/7/2022,"Life feels sweet for Arsenal and they showed it in overcoming a spirited Watford. Their three goals were all dazzlingly taken and conceived – even if Cucho Hernández’s spectacular early equaliser was the game’s standout moment – and moved them into the top four with games in hand over most of those around them. Martin Ødegaard, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli would grace the Champions League; they all scored to make the prospect ever likelier and, while Moussa Sissoko introduced a fresh element of doubt by squeezing in a late effort for Watford, Roy Hodgson watched a chance to make up ground on the rest of the relegation pack slip away. Ødegaard’s fifth-minute opener was the fruit of a stunning escalation in speed and control. The route to goal looked complicated when Saka picked up Ben White’s pass near the right touchline, but a sharp exchange of passes with the Norwegian sent him into space. As Saka assessed his options, Ødegaard had kept running into the box; he took the resulting cutback and, keeping his cool under pressure from Sissoko, found the bottom corner with precision. By that point Watford could already reflect that, had Emmanuel Dennis held his run onto João Pedro’s through ball a fraction longer, they would have been ahead after 16 seconds. That became a distant memory when Hernández scored as perfectly executed an overhead kick as one might ever see. Arsenal had looked ready to turn the screw but, after Sissoko did well to hold onto possession, Kiko Femenía was sent to the byline. His chipped cross was met near the penalty spot by Hernández, who provided a textbook demonstration of contortion power with an acrobatic finish that gave Aaron Ramsdale no prospect of intervening. Only 11 minutes had been played and, for a while, there was a sense that the obvious script had been ripped up. Hernández was playing instead of the injured Ismaïla Sarr but had come up with a piece of penetration as thrilling as anything his teammate might have mustered. Thomas Partey tried to produce his own piece of magic, bending a foot wide after neat footwork created the chance, but the game’s flow now felt perfectly equal. Dennis cut inside from the right for Watford and flashed in a low shot that Ramsdale fumbled; Arsenal survived but were coming under regular examination now. These days, though, they have individuals who can move the dial in an instant. Saka does that more than anyone and, just when Arsenal’s performance was drifting, he scored a goal that highlighted all elements of his contribution. Tom Cleverley hung onto the ball for too long 10 yards outside Watford’s penalty area and Saka, who had pressed ferociously from the start, was quick to steal possession. He played it into Alexandre Lacazette instantly, continuing his run and receiving a backheeled return. A first-time finish sent Ben Foster the wrong way and, once again, advertised one of the most scintillating talents in the Premier League. It felt harsh on Watford, but that is what top-four contenders do. While the rest of the first half was contested with little threat of another Arsenal goal bar a blocked Martinelli effort, the wind had been removed from the hosts’ sails well before the interval arrived. A piece of over-elaboration outside his area from Ramsdale moments after the restart should have given Sissoko the chance to shoot into an open goal, albeit from range and at an angle, but he could not arrange his feet. Watford would regret his indecision; they were shortly picked apart by a devastating attacking combination for the third time. Mikel Arteta could claim something akin to a pre-assist after an Imran Louza pass drifted out of play and he ran 10 yards down the touchline to press the ball into Saka’s hands. The unspoken message was to take a quick throw-in and Saka obliged, finding Cédric Soares on the overlap. Soares found Ødegaard, who flicked a cute pass into Lacazette; from there the captain laid back to Ødegaard for Martinelli to curl past Foster from 18 yards. The finish was similar to Saka’s and Arsenal, with goals from all of their clear chances, had been clinical. Cleverley had a glimpse of goal after more sloppy play from Ramsdale but the keeper redeemed himself. Lacazette and White screwed efforts off target at the other end but the next moment of note, going into the final 25 minutes, was the home support’s reaction when Hodgson replaced Louza with Edo Kayembe. The decision was met with boos and the chanting of Louza’s name; the midfielder had played well, save for that earlier mishap, but it did not feel an especially egregious point of contention. Dennis then completely miscued Femenía’s cross to the far post but, after the substitute Eddie Nketiah struck the upright for Arsenal, Sissoko made the final few minutes interesting. Arsenal held on and pressed home their claim.",Sport/Football,Gabriel Martinelli sends Arsenal fourth despite Watford fightback,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/06/watford-arsenal-premier-league-match-report
3/7/2022,"While Boris Johnson and his cabinet scramble to deliver measures that will give Vladimir Putin pause for thought in his assault on Ukraine, another – lesser known – Briton is poised to have a potentially more significant impact. Less than nine months into his tenure as the international criminal court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim Khan, a senior English barrister, announced this week that he had launched an investigation into the situation in Ukraine as there was “a reasonable basis” to believe that both alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity had been committed there. There is no guarantee charges will be brought against Putin and his acolytes but some cling to the hope that the prospect of potentially having to stand trial in the future and of being arrested in countries signed up to the ICC may make some of them think again. Prof Philippe Sands QC, who has known Khan since teaching him international law at King’s College London, said his former student had a tough job, but added: “All the signs are that he will have the capacity to be an independent, fearless and pragmatic prosecutor. “He’s had an extremely impressive career as an advocate,” said Sands. “He’s got huge experience and brings to that job real knowledge and experience of what it means to prepare, conduct and litigate an international criminal trial.” Reading law at King’s, Khan showed an early interest in international justice and human rights, something he has partly credited to his background of voluntary work with the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, a persecuted sect of Islam, of which he is a member. The community moved its headquarters to the UK in the 1980s after the Pakistani government passed a law forbidding Ahmadis from calling themselves Muslims and curbing their religious practices. Khan said his experience with them “helped me gravitate to this area [of human rights]”. He was called to the bar in 1992 and cut his teeth with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). In his first published interview after becoming ICC prosecutor, he told Counsel magazine that seeing the horrors of the Balkans war on television made him aspire to work at the international criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia, a goal he would eventually realise. It proved the catalyst for him to advocate in a series of domestic and international criminal courts including the ICC itself, the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda, the extraordinary chambers in the courts of Cambodia and the special tribunal for Lebanon. His was not just a prosecutor, acting also as victims’ counsel and defence counsel. Last year, the Legal 500 described him as the “go-to lawyer” in international criminal law. In England, he was made a QC in 2012 and was appointed as a part-time judge in 2018. Khan was sworn into office as ICC prosecutor in June last year, having been elected the previous February. He had not originally been on the shortlist and was added partly at the insistence of the Kenyan government. Khan had acted as defence counsel for the Kenyan vice-president, William Ruto, when he was charged with crimes against humanity following post-election violence in 2007 that led to 1,200 people being killed. The charges were dropped in 2016 by the ICC after what was described as “troubling incidence of witness interference and intolerable political meddling”. One key witness was killed in December 2014. Before the ICC election, Khan addressed this in an open letter detailing how he did all possible to prevent intimidation by ensuring the individual was put under witness protection and then seeking an inquiry. His suitability for the ICC role was also questioned by some, given that he defended Charles Taylor, the former Liberian president who was convicted of war crimes at special court for Sierra Leone. But even those accused of the most heinous crimes have the right to be represented, while Khan’s experience both as a prosecutor and defence counsel is not without advantages. Sands said there had never been any suggestion of inappropriate behaviour by his former student and the concerns about his election were more that he might be UK-centric – Khan’s predecessors were from the Gambia and Argentina respectively. However, Sands said Khan would do everything to avoid this and was well placed to do so given his personal background and vast international experience. He described Khan, who has studied and lectured on Islamic law and is a worldwide ambassador of the African Bar Association, as “a very modern British barrister”. Having launched the investigation, Khan’s job now, with the help of a large team, will be to gather sufficient evidence to persuade judges to issue warrants of arrest or summonses to appear. Evidence-gathering generally involves a mission to the country concerned, as well as collecting video and photographic evidence. With the ICC’s record on securing convictions a source of criticism, Sands said a key consideration for Khan would be who he chose to target. “I think he’s going to have a policy decision of whether he just goes for low-hanging fruit, low-level perpetrators, or whether he goes higher up,” said Sands. “I think the ICC has aimed too high [in the past] and it needs to build a track record.”",News/World news,Karim Khan: the ‘very modern British barrister’ heading ICC’s Russia inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/karim-khan-british-barrister-icc-russia-war-crimes-inquiry
3/7/2022,"Four years ago this month, I was travelling down to Dover with my then boss Keir Starmer to film Question Time. The process for prepping politicians for one of Britain’s longstanding political programmes is well rehearsed in Westminster. Party headquarters will send over a hundred-page document with all the “lines to take” about ourselves, our opponents and a tranche of obscure policies. Ministers and shadow ministers will then hunker down with their advisers for a few hours in the preceding days to hone the arguments (and decide how best to react if someone in the audience starts booing). Dover’s Question Time was meant to be a Brexit special, which, for the shadow Brexit secretary, should have been relatively straightforward. However, 10 days earlier, everything changed. Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned in Salisbury. The pages of notes written up about the advantages of Labour’s post-Brexit customs union versus the Conservative’s customs partnership became redundant. Everything was now about where Labour stood on an act of foreign aggression. As a former director of public prosecutions, Keir was well versed in matters of national security and, as a human rights lawyer, he had represented Alexander Litvinenko’s wife, Marina, in her case against the Russian state. Having listened to the various statements by the prime minister, Keir was firm on where he wanted to stand. Russia should be condemned for its involvement and we should fully back the action being taken by the government. No ifs, no buts. And yet, on the train journey down – with barely any warning – an article by the then leader Jeremy Corbyn dropped. It was a painful read. Eight-hundred words, but no condemnation of Russia for the attack. I remember my stomach sinking. How on earth can we defend this? I handed Keir my phone, told him to read the article and then asked for “a few minutes of silence and reflection” before deciding what to do. When we got off the train, his view hadn’t changed. He turned up, contradicted Corbyn, condemned Russia “without reservation”, backed the government and demanded strong action. It’s worth noting that Keir was not alone in taking this position. The then shadow foreign and defence secretaries, Emily Thornberry and Nia Griffith, took the same stance, as did many other Labour MPs. It’s often underestimated how damaging that moment was for Labour. At best the response was confused, at worst it appeared ambivalent about terrorism on British soil. It fed into a narrative with voters that, when it came to our nation’s security, Labour was soft, and an even deeper sense that we were no longer a party that would stand up for Britain. Changing that perception has been a fundamental part of Keir’s mission since he became leader two years ago. When he spoke of “a new leadership” in the summer of 2020, it was a message of change backed up with action. If Labour was to be a patriotic party again, then it had to be proud to stand with our nation’s flag. Despite how flippantly some people treated this at the time, I never needed a focus group to tell me that the candidate for the UK’s next prime minister should deliver speeches with the union jack behind him. To voters, the flag represents the country that political parties should aspire to serve – and protect. Google any political leader around the world – Joe Biden in the US, Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand, Olaf Scholz in Germany – and they stand with the flag of their respective nation. The Labour party should be no different. If Labour was to be trusted with our nation’s security again, then it had to bring clarity where previously there had been ambiguity. That included reaffirming our commitment to Nato – an institution that we helped to create in the aftermath of the second world war. And if Labour was to be seen as credible, it had to be decisive – and that is exactly what it has done these past few weeks in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, this isn’t simply about politics for Starmer; it comes from a deeper set of principles. I was his director of communications for four years. I lost count of the number of times he spoke publicly and privately of his admiration for our security services, and how he had seen first-hand the work they did to keep our country safe. When he says the government should change approach, he means it. And when he says Labour needs to change, he means it too. Foreign policy did not ultimately decide the 2019 election result, nor do I think it will ultimately decide 2024. I still believe the charge that the Conservatives are a low-growth, high-tax party will be a potent attack line – especially if Labour can demonstrate that it is the party to get Britain’s economy growing again. However, by restoring his party’s stance on security and patriotism, Starmer can go a long way towards showing Labour is once again a government-in-waiting.

The quiet intimacy of Jessica Au’s novella is beautifully affecting, the unnamed narrator’s precise travelogue triggering reflections on home, childhood and relationships. In these existential, aesthetic moments, her mother offers that “the best we could do in this life is pass through it, like smoke through the branches”. It is melancholic and wistful, but Au finds grace and succour in the small act of observing people, places and art.

An intriguing, contradictory and morally ambiguous early 20th-century character, Mann found himself on the wrong side of history in the first world war, won the Nobel prize in literature in 1929, and was a married father of six who kept his homosexuality hidden. From Lübeck in 1891 to Los Angeles in 1950, Tóibín brilliantly casts Mann as a prism through which we can view and understand upheaval, both global and personal.

3/7/2022,"A Maidenhead rabbi who is attempting to set up a “Ukrainetransport” for families fleeing the Russian invasion says he has been overwhelmed by offers of help in the UK. Jonathan Romain, whose mother fled Nazi Germany on the Kindertransport during the second world war, has been contacted by more than 240 people offering rooms for refugees. Explaining the initiative, he tweeted: “I have always wondered how I could repay the debt I owe to the Kindertransport, who saved my then 11-year-old mother. Now is the time, which is why I am helping to co-ordinate Ukrainetransport.” Romain praised the “amazing” response from those who have got in touch from across the UK, offering rooms in their houses, mobile homes and even one who has a hotel. He said an 84-year-old woman told him she wants to offer her spare room despite being due to have a cataract operation soon, while another whose husband receives kidney dialysis has offered to open up her home if there is a Ukrainian family who are also in need of dialysis, saying she can take them all to hospital at the same time. “It’s been that sort of really warm response, really caring response that’s been quite amazing,” he said. His initiative came as the UN’s high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said more than 1.5m million people have already fled Ukraine for neighbouring countries. The rabbi plans to contact the government on Monday with the offers he has received so far. The government has been criticised for its sluggish response to helping refugees from Ukraine. After delays, it has extended a visa scheme to allow more people from Ukraine to join relatives in the UK, but plans for a humanitarian refugee scheme to help those without family ties in Britain have yet to be announced. Romain, who is based in Maidenhead, Berkshire, said he hopes what happened with refugees coming to the UK from Afghanistan last year, being put up in hotels rather than hosted by British families, can be avoided. He said those wanting to help are a mix of people whose ancestors had to flee during the second world war, and others who have no previous experience of refugees but are “just appalled for humanitarian reasons”. Romain said: “So many people have responded and I have been overwhelmed by the numbers, but also the comments because people are so appalled by what’s going on and they feel so impotent and they want to help in some way, and yes of course we can send money and medical equipment, but people want to be much more involved. “Helping a Ukrainian family and making a real difference to them is what appeals to a lot of people who’ve got that capacity and therefore they said ‘we’re only too delighted to help’.” After fleeing the Nazis on the kindertransport, Romain’s mother was looked after by a family in Devon. He said: “When what’s been happening in Ukraine erupted, I thought ‘well, here’s my chance to repay the debt’. If it wasn’t for what Britain offered in hospitality to my mother, I wouldn’t be here and so this is perhaps the time for me and for my generation to step up.” He said: “The warmth of human company is enormously important, and also for people who are trying to get to know the language. So it’s not just a matter of a roof over the head, it’s a matter of looking after people and getting them to integrate.” Anyone who is interested in getting involved can email Rabbi Romain at rabbi@maidshul.org.",News/World news,Rabbi in UK wants a ‘Ukrainetransport’ for families fleeing the Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/rabbi-in-uk-wants-a-ukrainetransport-for-families-fleeing-the-russian-invasion
3/7/2022,"The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has said parliament’s intelligence and security committee should investigate the circumstances surrounding Boris Johnson’s elevation of Evgeny Lebedev to the House of Lords. The demand came after a fresh report that the intelligence agencies had reframed an assessment that Lebedev’s appointment would pose a security risk following an intervention from the prime minister in early 2020. Speaking on the BBC’s Sunday Morning, Starmer said he was very concerned: “There’s at least the suggestion that the government and the prime minister were warned that there was a national security risk in this particular appointment.” The Labour leader said the case should be referred to the all-party committee, which acts as a watchdog on intelligence matters, “so they can look into this story, this allegation, which is very serious, because of course, it’s a matter of national security”. But Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, said there was “a very strict and stringent process when anyone grants a peerage. I don’t know the facts of the case. I wasn’t involved in it. But I do know that it was applied very rigorously in this case.” Raab accused Starmer of exaggerating: “He doesn’t have any evidence that there’s any impropriety. There wasn’t, and if there was, he ought to produce it.” The controversy around Lebedev’s appointment was reignited earlier on Sunday by a prominent report in the Sunday Times that “Lebedev got peerage after spies dropped warning”, which followed previous reporting in the Guardian and Byline Times. Downing Street nominated Lebedev, who describes himself as a British and a Russian citizen, for a life peerage in July 2020. He took up his seat as Lord Lebedev of Hampton and Siberia the following December, although he has not voted since. But the House of Lords appointment commission (Holac), which scrutinises nominations, had initially asked Downing Street to reconsider in March 2020 after hearing evidence from Britain’s security services that Lebedev was deemed a potential security risk. The spy agencies had told the commission the issue related to his father, Alexander Lebedev, a one-time Moscow spy. During the late cold war period, Lebedev Sr worked undercover at the Soviet embassy in London. His real employer was KGB foreign intelligence, and he left in 1992 with the rank of colonel. Subsequently Alexander went into banking and media, buying the Independent and London Evening Standard. Evgeny is now the proprietor of the Standard, in which he wrote an open letter to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, last week saying: “I plead with you to use today’s negotiations to bring this terrible conflict in Ukraine to an end.” Downing Street refused to reconsider the nomination. Two days after Holac wrote its initial letter of concern, on 19 March, Johnson met Evgeny Lebedev, although it is not known whether the peerage was discussed. One source told the Sunday Times that the prime minister had himself complained “this is anti-Russianism” in response to the objections. In July, Downing Street resubmitted Lebedev’s name, to the surprise of some Holac members. Sources said what followed was a “to and fro” between No 10 and Holac, reflecting “concern about his antecedents”. Downing Street then sought further assurances from the security agencies. They said that their fundamental assessment about the possible security risk was unchanged, but they also provided extra context, which, sources said, was enough to lead to a different outcome. The peers reluctantly signed off on his appointment, with sources saying the committee felt “bounced”. In their confirmation letter, they are said to have called on Johnson to examine Russian influence in the House of Lords, something highlighted by parliament’s intelligence and security committee in its Russia report. Security sources have previously told the Guardian Lebedev’s “family links” mean that he is still regarded as a potential concern. But they estimate the risk to be low, partly because peers do not see classified documents. Both Downing Street and Lebedev have highlighted his charitable and business activities as reasons for the peerage. “Raising £75m for UK charities and spending £120m saving two great UK media titles might have had something to do with it,” Lebedev told the Guardian in the autumn of 2020.",News/Media,Keir Starmer calls for investigation into Evgeny Lebedev’s peerage,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/06/evgeny-lebedev-peerage-investigation-keir-starmer-boris-johnson
3/7/2022,"Leoš Janáček’s opera, turning on the central story of infanticide, is never anything but anguished and achingly sad. Now, with the sharp focus brought by the present times and the knowledge of atrocities being perpetrated in Ukraine, this Welsh National Opera revival of their 1998 production took on a powerful emotional force. Addressing the audience before it began, conductor and company music director, Tomáš Hanus, spoke movingly about the essential humanity of Janáček’s work and of the shared privilege of experiencing this in the face of the tragedy of war. The intensity he inspired in orchestra and singers spoke volumes. Director Katie Mitchell’s concept has always carried an uneasy tension. Underlining the claustrophobia of a tight-knit community, the mill-owner Grandmother Buryja and her daughter-in-law, the village sacristan, the Kostelnička, represent the two conditioning but stultifying elements of everyday village-life, work and religion. Both women see Jenůfa – granddaughter of one, stepdaughter of the other – as the single person who will create balance, but the complication is that she is pregnant by Steva, heir to the mill, loved by his half-brother, Laca. It is the latter who, in a moment of frenzied jealousy, slashes Jenůfa’s face. But the deeper scar is the death of baby Stevushka, murdered by the Kostelnička in the mistaken belief that she can right wrongs. With Elizabeth Llewellyn in the title role, it is Jenůfa’s intrinsic goodness that emerges so convincingly: her singing had great poise and lyrical line, she coloured the tenderness and compassion of her character, her agony at Stevushka’s loss simply heart-rending. That goodness, which Laca has actually always understood, is the agent for their ultimate love, the redeeming humanity to which Hanus referred. It is perhaps to the final optimism of Gabriela Preissová’s original novel that Mitchell’s enigmatic closing tableau alludes, with the backdrop rising to show a child of Jenůfa’s greeting its grandmother, the now re-habilitated Kostelnička. Peter Berger was an impassioned Laca, yet with tiny gestures of solicitousness carefully observed, and Rhodri Prys Jones a strong if unlikable Steva. Eliška Weissová’s Kostelnička was a formidable figure, her fine soprano blazing first with the certainty of her conviction that she had Jenůfa’s wellbeing at heart, and then with the bitter remorse on admission of her crime. This was a wholly compelling performance from cast, chorus and orchestra alike, embracing such empathy and commitment as to leave its audience deeply moved and more than a bit drained.

3/7/2022,"Spain’s interior minister has defended the behaviour of police who were filmed beating and pepper-spraying a young Sub-Saharan African man as he climbed over the border fence between Morocco and Spain’s north African enclave of Melilla, insisting the officers’ use of force was “proportionate”. The video emerged last week as about 3,700 people tried to scale the six-metre (20ft) fence over two days. On Wednesday, an unprecedented 2,500 people tried to clamber over the border, of whom 491 succeeded. The following day, 1,200 people attempted to cross over, with 380 making it. The incident, which took place as Spain drew up an express system to take in people fleeing the war in Ukraine, has been criticised by human rights groups and has drawn the attention of Spain’s public ombudsman. Spain’s government, however, said “the level of aggression” displayed by some of those trying to cross into Melilla was unprecedented, adding that about 60 Guardia Civil and Policía Nacional officers, and 52 migrant people, were injured on Wednesday and Thursday. Its delegate in the enclave said some people had screwed bolts to their shoes to help them cross, posing “a huge risk” to police. Footage of the incident, shot by Spain’s national broadcaster, RTVE, shows the man being struck as he descends, and then again as he reaches Spanish soil and is beaten to the ground and set upon by at least five police officers. 📺 Estas dos últimas jornadas en #Melilla con los dos saltos a la valla nos están dejando imágenes cómo estas. @rtvenoticias pic.twitter.com/baATJZA8zt Virginia Álvarez, a refugee and migration expert at Amnesty International Spain, said the images were especially jarring as Spain prepared to help Ukrainian refugees. “While that’s going on, migrant people on our own borders are being punished with extreme brutality,” she said. “Is this the image we want to project? Is that how we’re going to take in people who may also be fleeing possible conflict and persecution?” Andalucía’s Pro-Human Rights Association said the Spanish government needed to provide an explanation about the incident and on “the pushbacks [summary returns] that are taking place”. Spain’s public ombudsman, Ángel Gabilondo, said he had asked the government for more information on “what would appear to be a disproportionate use of force by the officers”. He added: “Border control should be undertaken with respect for the guarantees and fundamental rights of everyone, whether they are agents of authority or people trying to enter national territory.” But speaking on a visit to Melilla on Saturday, Spain’s interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, described the border breaches as “extremely violent” and said meat hooks, sticks and hammers had been used in the crossings. The minister also said the level of violence the police had endured was evident in the cracked helmets and damaged ballistic shields he had been shown. Grande-Marlaska said that while police officers were always bound by the law, they had shown a “proportionate” response to the situation. “A democratic state with the rule of law cannot allow its borders – which in this case are EU borders – to be violently attacked,” he said. “Nor can it allow its public servants in the Guardia Civil and Policía Nacional, who provide the necessary space for all of us to be able to exercise our rights and freedoms, to be assaulted.” In May last year, about 10,000 people – including 2,000 minors – crossed into Spain’s other north African enclave, Ceuta, over the course of a few days. Their arrival led the Spanish government to accuse Morocco of playing politics with its borders after Madrid allowed the leader of the Western Sahara independence movement to enter Spain for Covid treatment.

3/7/2022,"In conflict, where information is everything, what is striking about the war in Ukraine is not what is known but the very large areas of unknowns. And even as commentators have picked over and analysed everything that is known about the Russian military’s operations and performance in Ukraine in an effort to predict the trajectory of the conflict, it’s what is poorly understood that may yet be more significant still. One issue that has come under the spotlight is the rate of loses of soldiers and equipment on the Russian side in the week and a half so far of fighting. In that period, images of dead and captured Russian soldiers and destroyed or abandoned equipment have become commonplace as it has become clear that Russian forces have lost everything from aircraft to main battle tanks and even whole convoys. But attrition is not a one way street, and what is far less clear is the level of losses sustained by Ukrainian forces, with no equivalent social media avalanche from the Russian side parading this, and Ukraine understandably not wanting to advertise its losses. While some images of equipment losses have appeared – most strikingly the Ukrainian navy’s flagship, which was scuttled in port over the weekend – observers have been left to guess what might have occurred through what is not visible and what is not happening. One case in point has been the Ukrainian air force and air defences, which were hit heavily in the opening days of the conflict. While Russia claimed to have neutralised Ukrainian air defences, it is clear some capacity survives, but not how much. This matters because attrition is not a symmetrical problem. Because it is more difficult to attack than defend a position, traditionally – and with other advantages such as technology set aside – military planners have thought that attacking forces need roughly a three-to-one advantage. What that means in practical terms is that the Russian military planners drawing up the design of the invasion of Ukraine should have built into their planning losses of soldiers or equipment. Again what we don’t know is whether what we have been seeing is within those calculations or exceeding it. Another issue that has seen a lot of attention is the question of Russian progress on their offensive timetable, much talked about in defence and intelligence briefings in western capitals. While it has been treated as a given that the Kremlin thought Ukraine would fall easily in the early days of the invasion, we don’t actually know what the Russian military assumptions were or continue to be or even whether those plans have changed. In other words, when Russian forces do not seem to be advancing, does that mean they are “stalling” because of problems or are we seeing an operational pause? Or a combination of the two? That prospect was raised on Saturday in the latest update by Frederick Kagan and his colleagues at the Institute for the Study of War thinktank when they suggested Russian forces in Ukraine “may have entered a possibly brief operational pause on 5 March as they prepare to resume operations against Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, and possibly Odesa in the next 24-48 hours”. One intelligence assumption from before the invasion – that Moscow would be content with a limited campaign in Donbas and Crimea – turned out to be wrong as Russia has attacked in a far more substantial way, not least in its attempt to take the capital, Kyiv, and depose the government of Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Then there is the issue of how meaningfully Russia is in charge in the areas it is claiming. While maps widely published in the media and elsewhere have shown large areas now under Russian military control, the reality is that these maps in large parts of the country are an exercise in simply colouring in between the roads controlled by Russian forces. Then there is the biggest unknown of all. One of the key concepts in understanding conflicts and their potential outcomes is where states stand on the spectrum from fragility to resilience, an issue that takes in everything from social cohesion in conflict to the ability to sustain a protracted war effort, particularly national mobilisation for a war effort.",News/World news,Clear picture of war in Ukraine clouded by large areas of unknowns,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/clear-picture-russian-war-ukraine-clouded-unknowns-lack-reliable-information
3/7/2022,"In some of London’s most exclusive neighbourhoods, you can suddenly sense the kind of unease that wealth usually keeps at bay. As the government talks up its determination to crack down on Russian oligarchs, a much wider shift may be afoot. On Friday the Financial Times quoted the chair of Aylesford International, a Chelsea estate agent whose current offerings include a four-bedroom apartment in Cadogan Square, SW3, going for the best part of £12m. “The severity of these sanctions is the beginning of a new world, a new market,” he said. “I don’t think you can hide any more.” On Monday, the House of Commons will debate the government’s economic crime (transparency and enforcement) bill – first drafted four years ago, since subjected to serial delays, but now finally revived thanks to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Ministers say they want to tackle the tangle of secrecy and deception that has long surrounded money stripped out of overseas economies and poured into British property, assets and banks, and thereby smooth the way for even harsher action against people linked to the Russian government. Whether this will do anything to halt the current killing and chaos is rather more doubtful than some people are making out, but Boris Johnson insists the bill will “continue to tighten the noose around Putin’s regime”. Among its other measures, the new legislation will create a public register of the owners of overseas interests that buy and sell property in the UK, to lift the veil provided by shell companies. There will be reforms to the system of unexplained wealth orders that will supposedly allow the UK authorities to seize criminal assets without the need to prove criminal activity, and a new specialist “kleptocracy cell” in the National Crime Agency to pay close attention to issues around sanctions. But the intended impression of resolve and determination does not quite hold up; indeed, an array of last-minute amendments shows how sensitive Johnson and his colleagues are to accusations of weakness and foot-dragging. Though the government has previously suggested that judicial restraints on its power ought to be swept away, it now insists that, for fear of legal action, any serious moves against certain Russian individuals may take months – even as France, Germany and Italy seize Putin associates’ yachts. The bill has seemingly been through four years of preparation, but any plans to insist on better checks on records filed at Companies House – also a factor, incidentally, in fraudulent claims for loans and grants during the pandemic – are still not ready, and will only surface in further legislation. Given that the National Crime Agency is at the heart of many of the plans, it is also worth bearing in mind that Britain’s supposed equivalent of the FBI has suffered real-terms funding cuts over the last five years, and is viewed by experts as not having the resources to recruit and retain the right people. Recently I spoke to Susan Hawley, the executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, a British charity that monitors the UK’s role in the intersection of criminality and power in the UK and across the world. The new bill, she said, is being talked up as a huge potential blow against dirty money and the secrecy it demands, but is really a set of tentative first steps. The changes it outlines are limited, she told me, because a long history of indulging oligarchs and kleptocrats has settled into deep groupthink, and even if ministers’ intentions are serious, leaving that behind will take time and effort. “The trouble is that they’ve been obsessed with opening up and making Britain the easiest place in the world to do business,” she said. “And that made them complacent.” Underneath all the hype, this is the basic reason why Britain has become a haven for so much dirty money. To understand that in an instant, consider the system of “golden visas” that the UK used for more than 25 years, allowing people to live in the country in return for investment in UK-registered companies. In 2014, the level of cash required was doubled from £1m to £2m; on 17 February this year, the scheme was scrapped. But between 2008 and early 2015, to quote from a report by the thinktank Chatham House, “checks that were carried out on applicants were the sole responsibility of the law firms and wealth managers representing them”. This became known as the “blind faith” period. Twenty-three per cent of applications over that time came from Russia; last year, it was estimated that in the 11 years up to 2019, only 9% of golden visa applications were rejected, compared with 42% of requests for asylum. In 2006, the same year that the Putin critic Alexander Litvinenko was murdered in London, the city’s then-mayor Ken Livingstone said that he wanted “Russian companies to regard London as their natural base in Europe”, and his office established a small department aimed at attracting Russian money to London. Five years later, David Cameron went to Moscow and told his audience that Britain was open to their money as a matter of design. “The whole point about trade is that we are baking a bigger cake and everyone can benefit from it and this is particularly true, perhaps, of Russia and Britain,” he said. He went on: “Governments need to remember that businesses don’t have to invest in our country – they choose to. And we need to help them make that choice. It means minimising the burden of regulation so that business and entrepreneurship can flourish.” Late last year, Boris Johnson addressed a Global Investment Summit at the Science Museum in South Kensington, and when told that the people in the room represented $24tn of wealth, gushed: “I want to say to each and every one of those dollars: you are welcome to the UK and you have come to the right place at the right time.” Such was the cash-hungry mindset built into London’s branding for decades: the levels of dirty money in the capital are not its unintended byproduct, but exactly what this kind of approach was always going to invite. In terms of the everyday experience of Londoners, a great hoovering-up of often ill-gotten billions has had very visible consequences. Far too many streets are now full of houses and flats bought by absent individuals, while the boom at the very top of the capital’s property economy has accelerated the rise of prices and rents to completely impossible levels. Russia is hardly the only country whose wealthy citizens are at the heart of these changes, but as they put down roots in London, post-Soviet oligarchs have represented a kind of doubled inequality. The 500 Russians with a net worth of more than $100m control 40% of their country’s household wealth. And once great chunks of that money were pumped into London, the capital’s own inequalities inevitably worsened. This only compounded the jarring mixture of exclusiveness and deathly quiet you now experience on the streets of Belgravia, Knightsbridge, Holland Park, Highgate, Kensington, Chelsea, Notting Hill, Bayswater and all the rest. Some of these areas have always been dominated by vast wealth, but in others, there were once diverse, confident communities of comparatively ordinary people who created the cultural vitality that is still used to sell London to the world. As the international billions began to pour in, big money was hailed as yet another boost to the capital’s energy. But that was usually a con: besides a few donations to art galleries and museums, what much of London ended up with was both an awful moral murkiness, and silence. This is what happens when dizzying, often secretive wealth shuts out the people who actually make cities thrive, and it highlights a very topical question: why did it take a war for so many of our politicians to even begin to wake up? We all know the answer. As all this played out, estate agents, private schools and luxury goods retailers made hay. Shamefully, lawyers took huge fees to go after investigative journalists who were set on revealing the worst aspects of what was going on. Donations to the Conservative party rolled in, and too many peers and MPs luxuriated in yet another connection to wealth and power. Now, many of the same people who allowed everything to happen suddenly tell us that the party has to end. Whether they are even halfway sincere is something that all of us – including ordinary Londoners, people long since priced out of the capital, and the kleptocrats nervously marking time behind their stucco facades and security gates – are about to find out.
