12/31/2021,"As major airlines grapple with holiday flight cancellations caused by staff being stricken by the coronavirus, there is another problem looming on the horizon that could bring pain to the sector.  That is a significant pilot shortage triggered by mandatory retirement ages for those 65 years old. Long-time airline analyst Helane Becker of Cowen estimates the industry may need 35,000 to 40,000 new pilots over the next decade — to offset an increase in retirements and keep pace with travel demand.  ""We have all these pilots who came on staff in the 1980s and they are approaching 65 years old,"" Becker said on Yahoo Finance Live, noting many will opt to retire at the age of 62.  Becker says if the industry doesn't see an influx of pilots, the airlines will be forced to cut flights to smaller cities. In effect, they would miss out on sales and profits.  Other experts believe the pilot shortage will become a headwind for the industry even sooner.  ""Based on a modest recovery scenario, we believe a global pilot shortage will emerge in certain regions no later than 2023 and most probably before. However, with a more rapid recovery and greater supply shocks, this could be felt as early as late this year. Regarding magnitude, in our most likely scenarios, there is a global gap of 34,000 pilots by 2025. This could be as high as 50,000 in the most extreme scenarios,"" said Geoff Murray at consulting firm Oliver Wyman.  In the meantime, building a pipeline of new pilots is on the back-burner for an airline industry just trying to survive the peak holiday season during a global pandemic.  There were 7,624 flight delays on Thursday and 2,623 cancellations, according to FlightAware, as airlines see their staffs plowed through by the pandemic. The travel chaos commenced in the days leading up to Christmas, and has shown little signs of abating. In fact, some major airlines have begun proactively cutting flights.  Surprisingly, shares of major airlines Southwest Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines have gained an average of 4% over the past five trading sessions even in the face of the travel mess. JetBlue shares are down 1%. Says Becker, ""I think he fourth quarter started off OK. I think people are shrugging off the Omicron variant. I think every time one of these variants occur, every successive one hasn't been as bad as the one prior. Demand is still strong."" Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

12/31/2021,"Start saving those pennies as driving your car may cost way more in 2022, predicts gas price tracking firm GasBuddy.  In a new study released on Wednesday, GasBuddy forecasts the nationwide average price for gas will be $3.41 in 2022. The current price nationwide averages about $3.29. GasBuddy thinks prices could near $4 a gallon by June as drivers take to the roads for the summer.  As no surprise, California is seen as primed for more gas price inflation in 2022.  GasBuddy thinks gas prices could approach $6 a gallon in San Francisco, while hovering around $5.50 in Los Angelos and Sacramento.  The average price for gas in California is currently $4.65, per data from AAA. In total, the average U.S. household may spend $2,341 next year on gas, compared to $1,977 in 2021. It would be the most spent on gas by households since 2014, according to GasBuddy. The inflationary call on gas prices comes as the bulls begin to retake the oil market despite the fast-spreading Omicron variant starting to weigh on global economic growth.  Oil prices continue to hover around one-month highs.  Brent crude oil traded down slightly Wednesday to $78.43 a barrel. Prices for the commodity have shot 15% higher so far in December.  Oil experts think there is further room to run in oil prices as the world tries to claw its way out of the pandemic. In turn, that is likely to be supportive of the higher gas prices, GasBuddy predicts. ""We are going to see the demand picture continue to pick up going into the [summer] driving season. Hopefully we can get this pandemic behind us. You'll see all that pent-up travel demand really take back off again. Flights were pretty full over the holiday weekend, but we expect them to get even fuller as the capacity picks up. If you look at the supply side on crude oil, we have 432 million barrels. The five-year average is 460 million, so supplies are quite tight. We don't expect OPEC to take any kind of reaction by picking up their supply picture. So we expect any kind of small supply shock would send prices higher. We are expecting $85 to $90 [a barrel] oil next year,"" said Phil Streible of Blue Line Futures on Yahoo Finance Live.
