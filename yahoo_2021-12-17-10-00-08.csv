12/17/2021,"  Police obtained a search warrant for Alec Baldwin's phone on Thursday. Police intend to review all text messages on the phone, as well as location data. They are investigating the October 21 killing of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Santa Fe police obtained a search warrant Thursday authorizing them to seize Alec Baldwin's cellphone as part of their investigation into the deadly shooting on the set of ""Rust,"" according to documents obtained by Insider. The search warrant authorizes police to review all text messages and photos on the actor's iPhone, as well as any stored location data, as part of their investigation into the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Hutchins, 42, was killed on October 21 after being hit by a projectile from a prop gun that Baldwin was holding during the filming of a scene. Baldwin has said he assumed the gun only contained ""dummy"" rounds, and has insisted that he did not pull the trigger. Police are still trying to determine how a ""live"" round ended up in gun. According to the search warrant, Baldwin told police that he exchanged emails with the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, regarding what style of gun to use in the film, ultimately deciding on a Colt .45 pistol. Gutierrez Reed told police that she loaded the gun with five empty rounds before lunch on the day of the shooting incident, per the search warrant. Gutierrez Reed said of the weapon that she ""didn't really check it too much"" after lunch, adding that she did have trouble loading it with another empty round. She then added another, bringing the total rounds to six. A lawyer for Gutierrez Reed has suggested the set could have been the victim of ""sabotage."" But she herself discounted the possibility that anyone, in the words of the police, would ""be that malicious to bring live ammo onto the set.""

12/17/2021,"Two women were trying to stop bear hunters before one unleashed a German shepherd – and an attack ensued, according to Vermont wildlife officials. The loose dog attacked one of the hunters’ leashed hounds, causing injuries that needed veterinary care, officials said. After an investigation of “hunter harassment,” Donna Babic and Betty Eastman “were found guilty of interfering” with the three hunters on Nov. 22, the state’s Fish & Wildlife Department announced in a Dec. 14 news release. “I would ask that Vermonters respect one another’s constitutional right to hunt,” Col. Jason Batchelder, Fish and Wildlife’s chief game warden, said in a statement. A hunter and two others were using hounds to hunt black bears in Groton State Forest with one bear leading “the hounds onto private property before climbing a tree” on Oct. 9, the release said. They left the bear alone, rounded up the hounds and headed back to the hunter’s truck, where they found Babic and Eastman letting air out of his tires, officials said. The two women, both of Groton, argued with the hunters, and that’s when one let the German shepherd out of her car, leading to the hound’s attack, according to the release. The private property was not owned by Babic and Eastman, who are opposed to hunting bears with hounds, Batchelder told McClatchy News. They believed the hunters were illegally trespassing and let air out of the truck’s tires “so the hunters would not leave” and police would catch them, Batchelder said. An investigation by a state game warden “found the licensed and permitted bear hunters to be acting lawfully,” the release noted. A state police spokesperson, Adam Silverman, confirmed the private property was owned by a third party. “Vermonters don’t always agree on wildlife management, especially when it comes to big game,” Batchelder said in a statement. “Intentionally interfering with legal hunters in any fashion will result in court action, especially in a potentially dangerous fashion as we saw in this case.” The two women “were each fined $262 and will lose their license privileges for fishing, hunting and trapping for a year,” according to the release. “So many Vermonters oppose hounding and for various reasons, including the inherent cruelty to animals, the unavoidable violation of landowners’ rights, and conflicts with other recreational activities, but we never condone acting unlawfully,” nonprofit organization Protect Our Wildlife Vermont said in a Dec. 16 Facebook post. “There are practical and sensible ways that citizens can fight hounding that include legislative efforts and using the only tool currently available to legally protect citizens: the posting law,” the post added.

12/17/2021,"TOKYO (AP) — Tokyo has confirmed its first case of the omicron variant of the coronavirus in a traveler from the United States, and her friend whom she saw immediately after arrival has since tested positive after going to a soccer game. Separately, the Health Ministry announced Thursday that one of its quarantine officials also tested positive for the omicron variant. The new findings bring Japan’s confirmed omicron cases to 34. So far, Japan’s government says all omicron cases have been detected by its border controls, but experts say it would be a matter of time before cases of community transmission start surfacing. Tokyo’s omicron patient tested negative for COVID-19 upon arrival at the airport on Dec. 8, but developed a fever the next day during her self-isolation at home and tested positive for the virus, the Health Ministry said in a statement. Her samples were further analyzed and confirmed Thursday as the omicron variant. The men she met immediately after returning also developed a fever and other symptoms. He attended a soccer game with 10 people, including his family and colleagues, before testing positive. His samples were being analyzed for the omicron variant. The ministry urged spectators who attended the packed Sunday soccer game in Kawasaki, near Tokyo, to get tested. Japan has stepped up border controls since the omicron variant was first reported in South Africa, and now bans new entry of foreign nationals. Japan has had about 1.73 million cases since the pandemic began, with about 18,400 deaths.",World/Associated Press,Tokyo finds omicron case in US arrival isolating at home,https://news.yahoo.com/tokyo-finds-omicron-case-us-122236874.html
