12/29/2021,"A man searching for deer antlers in a wooded area of Missouri discovered human remains identified as missing amateur Mixed Martial Arts fighter David Koenig, police said. The grisly discovery brings an end to the nearly two-year search for Koenig, who was 25 when he was last seen in a Branson motel in February 2020. The remains were found in the woods near the 3700 block of Fall Creek Road in Branson, located in the Ozarks region, on Dec. 22, local police said Monday in a news release. The man who found them called authorities, who responded to the scene and determined the remains were human. Investigators from the Branson Police Department and the Taney County Coroner’s Office conducted a “meticulous search” of the area, “recovering mosts of the remains and several other personal artifacts,"" police said. On Monday, officials determined the human remains belonged to Koenig. A forensic pathologist determined “there was no trauma and that the death did not appear to be the result of foul play,"" according to the police release. Investigators had spent thousands of hours looking for Koenig, including conducting several searches of properties in Taney and Stone counties in Missouri as well as Boone County, Arkansas, police said. “Our department and the amazing group of volunteers never stopped in our efforts to find Mr. Koenig,” Branson Police Chief Jeff Matthews said. “While this is not the ending we hoped for, we offer our sincere condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Koenig."" The circumstances around his death remain unclear, but his mother, Tracy Koenig, previously said he may have been in distress. In July 2020, Tracy Koenig told Dateline her son was friends with the owner of the Peach Tree Inn in Branson, where he had stayed for a couple of nights before vanishing. “He messaged a few of his friends asking for help,” she said at the time. “He thought he might be in some sort of trouble. But by the time they read the messages and tried to respond to him, he had stopped messaging. There was no answer from him.” His family reported him missing in March 2020 to Branson police and a joint investigation was launched with the Missouri State Highway Patrol. “He’s just not someone who would disappear. And he’s not a guy that someone could just take down,” Tracy Koenig said in that July 2020 interview. “He’s a force to be reckoned with. He’s a big, strong guy — but also with a big personality and big heart. He would do anything to protect his family.""",U.S./NBC News,Man searching for deer antlers in Missouri finds remains of missing MMA fighter,https://news.yahoo.com/man-searching-deer-antlers-missouri-132840795.html
12/29/2021,"Fury over the Oregon father who concluded his family's call with President Biden by saying ""Let's go, Brandon"" is being mocked online, with critics pointing out there was little outrage when profane insults were aimed at former President Trump. ""OMG a guy was disrespectful to the president of the United States in one of the most euphemistic ways possible after four years of the entire legacy media celebrating pussyhats, middle fingers, and f*** yous directed at the president of the United States, everybody freak out,"" conservative commentator Ben Shapiro said on Twitter Monday. DAD TELLS BIDEN, ‘LET’S GO, BRANDON' DURING CHRISTMAS EVE CALL – AND BIDEN RESPONDS Shapiro was referring to a viral Christmas Eve moment that saw Jared Schmeck, a 35-year-old father of four from Oregon, conclude his call with Biden by saying ""Let's go, Brandon,"" a phrase that has become a stand-in for the more vulgar ""F*** Joe Biden"" chants that at one point were spreading across the country. The moment caused immediate backlash for Schmeck, who said he has received threats since video of his conversation went viral. The incident was also not well-received by much of the media, with NBC News referring to the exchange as a ""right-wing slur"" while ABC News called it a ""vulgar insult."" The Atlantic senior editor Ron Brownstein took things a step further during a Friday appearance on CNN, saying that the exchange was ""about insurrection."" ""Look, it's ungracious. It's juvenile. It's reprehensible by the father, but I don't think it's fundamentally about incivility. It's about insurrection,"" Brownstein said. ""I don't know the individual, but the whole Let's Go Brandon kind of motif is a reflection of the view of two-thirds of the Republican base, driven by Trump's claims, false claims, and the Big Lie, that Biden is an illegitimate president."" But critics such as Shapiro pointed out there was much less outrage in cases where vulgar insults were directed at Trump, including when Virginia woman Juli Briskman was photographed flipping the then-president a middle finger as his motorcade passed her riding a bicycle in 2017. Briskman was soon fired from her job with a government contractor after the photo went viral, prompting many to come to her defense. ""It should be illegal to fire the cyclist who gave Trump the finger,"" declared a headline in the Washington Post shortly after Briskman's firing. Briskman used her newfound notoriety and sympathetic media coverage to launch a bid for and win a race to represent her area on the Loudoun County, Virginia Board of Supervisors in 2019, prompting even more kind news coverage. ""Take that, Mr. President: Woman who gave the finger to Trump's car wins election,"" read an NBC News headline after Briskman's election victory. Conservative Commentator Stephen L. Miller also alluded to the differences in reaction between Schmeck's comment to Biden and Briskman's middle finger, reposting an image of the viral photo as debate of the Schmeck incident raged on Twitter. ""Trump was very easy to make fun of, and people should have made fun of him. It's a wonderful thing that we have a country where we can get away with it,"" Miller said in a subsequent tweet. As the controversy rages, Schmeck said that he considered his use of the line a ""joke"" but has now been ""attacked"" for the exchange. ""And now I am being attacked for utilizing my freedom of speech,"" Schmeck told The Oregonian newspaper Saturday. ""He seems like he’s a cordial guy,"" Schmeck continued, referring to the president. ""There’s no animosity or anything like that. It was merely just an innocent jest to also express my God-given right to express my frustrations in a joking manner. … I love him just like I love any brother or sister.""",Politics/Fox News,"Outrage over father telling Biden 'Let's go, Brandon' louder than when Trump incurred similar insults",https://news.yahoo.com/outrage-over-father-telling-biden-122443938.html
12/29/2021,"About a year ago, a team of astronomers working in Hawaii glimpsed something in the night sky. A four-minute-long flash of light. Depending on who you ask, that flash was either a powerful explosion from 13.4 billion years ago—a virtual snapshot of the universe as it existed just 400 million years after its formation—or a reflection from a hunk of space junk lazily looping around Earth. Scientific treasure—or garbage. Despite a year of heated debate and a flurry of studies, it’s possible we may never know what caused this mysterious flash, dubbed “GN-z11-flash” for the faraway galaxy where it may have originated. But this is high-stakes astronomy—either a landmark, career-defining discovery, or the type of embarrassment people spend their whole lives trying to avoid. As astronomers stretch the limits of technology and scholarship to peer farther and farther into space, they run into more and more obstacles. Our telescopes aren’t good enough. Our computers are too slow. Our data is too thin. Distant observations are so delicate and shrouded in uncertainty that a passing piece of space garbage can spoil everything. Back in 2017, a team of astronomers led by Linhua Jiang, from China’s Peking University, was peering through the Keck I telescope in Hawaii, observing GN-z11. They were using an infrared spectrometer attached to the telescope, expecting to scrutinize the galaxy—which at 13.4 billion light-years away is the oldest and most distant object humanity has ever observed—for clues about the early history of the universe. GN-z11 like many very old, very faraway galaxies is only visible in infrared. They didn’t expect to witness an explosion. But if you believe the team’s subsequent analysis, that’s exactly what happened. For 245 seconds, Keck I registered what appeared to be a possible gamma-ray burst from the universe’s infancy. Observing a 13.4 billion-year-old gamma-ray burst, or GRB, would be a profound stroke of luck with equally profound implications for the study of, well, everything. “GRBs and their associated emission can be used to probe the star-formation and reionization history in the era of cosmic dawn,” Jiang and his team wrote in their initial paper, which appeared in the science journal Nature Astronomy in December 2020. “Reionization” refers to the eons half a billion years after the Big Bang when the hydrogen making up most of the atoms in the universe ionized and murky space became transparent. It’s a mysterious era—the first eons of light following a period of hundreds of millions of years during which space was swirling with opaque gases. Witnessing an explosion from that timeframe would be a scientific coup. “This means that gamma-ray bursts can be efficiently produced at a very early time,” Jiang told The Daily Beast. In other words, the explosions we associate with the deaths of stars, and the creation of black holes, started happening really early. If gamma rays were bursting as long ago as 13.4 billion years, it means the universe—its structure and galaxy-forming mechanisms—evolved fast into what we see around us today. But other astronomers weren’t convinced Jiang and his team had seen anything remotely interesting. The odds of glimpsing a gamma-ray burst 13.4 billion light years away are infinitesimally slim, a team led by Michał Michałowski, an astronomer at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland, explained in Nature Astronomy in October. In astronomy, a “redshift” is the change in a faraway galaxy’s infrared signature that helps us to determine its age. GN-z11 naturally has a very high redshift, which suggests it’s ancient. But astronomers haven’t confirmed any other galaxies remotely this old. The next oldest, galaxy EGSY8p7, has a redshift of 8.7, meaning it’s probably hundreds of millions of years younger than GN-z11. U.S. and Chinese Astronomers Are Teaming Up to Hunt for Alien Lights Astronomers would need to find a lot more galaxies in GN-z11’s age range and spend a lot more time pointing telescopes at them in order to be sure what a gamma-ray burst from these old galaxies even looks like, Michalkowski and his team noted. “A larger sample of very high redshift galaxies is needed to detect such distant GRBs.” It was way, way more likely that Jiang and his team caught a reflection from the castoff Breeze-M upper stage of a 6-year-old Russian Proton rocket. “We searched Space-Track, the largest publicly available database of Earth satellites and space debris for an object close to the position of GN-z11-flash at the time of observations,” Michałowski’s team wrote. “We found the Breeze-M space debris.” This particular argument comes down, in part, to common sense, Michałowski told The Daily Beast. “The conclusion is that either it was an extraordinary discovery of something we have not seen yet—a gamma-ray burst at redshift 11—or an obvious explanation with a well-identified space debris, which we are certain went either through the field of view of the Keck telescope or just outside of it… with all properties consistent with being a flash. “Everybody can pick the explanation they prefer, but I don’t have doubts myself,” Michałowski added. He said he considers the controversy “settled.” Jiang and his team disagree. “We looked into our records and found that this satellite was ruled out in our original analysis,” they explained in a new paper, a preprint of which appeared online last week but has not yet been peer-reviewed. Jiang et al’s calculations put the Russian rocket shell and the potential GN-z11-flash inches apart in the telescope’s field of view—a distance they claimed should preclude any confusion between the rocket and a gamma-ray burst from the distant galaxy. Besides, they added, the rocket’s reflection “was much fainter than what was needed to produce the flash.” The yearlong back-and-forth, which included two other major criticisms of the Jiang team’s conclusions, has so far ended in impasse, with no resolution in sight. “We will never know the true nature of this flash,” Jiang said. If we had a lot of good data on confirmed gamma-ray bursts from billions of light-years away, we might be able to compare them to the GN-z11-flash and see if they match. Jiang said he looked and couldn’t find anything to form a comparison. “I spent lots of time searching,” he explained. “Unfortunately we didn’t get such data.” That could change in the future. Better telescopes—such as NASA’s new James Webb Space Telescope, launched on Dec. 25 as a Christmas treat—combined with very powerful computers could help us spot and categorize faraway explosions. With time, luck and new technology, we might eventually be able to reassess the GN-z11-flash. But Bing Zhang, a University of Nevada astronomer and a member of Jiang’s team, is urging patience. A lot of it. “One needs very powerful telescopes to continuously monitor many distant but faint galaxies to constrain the event rate of GN-z11-flash-like events,” he told The Daily Beast. It’s possible that, a year ago, astronomers caught a fleeting glimpse of the universe’s infancy. It’s also possible they caught a fleeting glimpse of Russian space trash. For the foreseeable future, we probably won’t know which it was. Read more at The Daily Beast. Got a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!

12/29/2021,"It may not be long before President Biden has to grapple with a North Korea crisis. The big picture: Dictator Kim Jong-un has remained relatively quiet during Biden's presidency so far, keeping his threats and missile testing well below the “fire and fury” levels of the early Trump administration. But a quieter North Korea is not necessarily a less dangerous one. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free What to watch: Kim could force his way onto Biden’s agenda in 2022 through a major provocation, a charm offensive, or a combination of the two, potentially ahead of the South Korean election in March, says Bruce Klingner, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation and formerly the CIA's deputy division chief for Korea. The state of play: Biden administration officials say they’ve proposed talks, but the North Koreans aren’t engaging. North Korea, meanwhile, conducted missile tests in 2021, but not on a level that rings global alarm bells. Kim has still yet to test a nuclear weapon or inter-continental ballistic missile since 2017, but he did show off advanced new missiles at a military parade last January. With Pyongyang spurning diplomacy but limiting its provocations, Biden has essentially been in wait-and-see mode. Kim, who succeeded his father 10 years ago this month, promised his people dual development of the economy as well as the military and nuclear program. Still, North Korea’s weaponry has advanced much more rapidly than its economy over the past decade. Kim was unusually candid, by Pyongyang’s standards, in acknowledging “tense” food supply issues last June after shutting down nearly all trade, even with neighboring China, to keep the coronavirus out. It’s difficult to gauge the depth of North Korea’s food crisis, though some low-level trade seems to be resuming. North Korea’s path out of the pandemic will be rocky, as Kim has spurned offers of vaccines. The intrigue: Outgoing South Korean President Moon Jae-in largely bet his presidency on improved relations with North Korea, and is searching for a win before stepping down. Moon is pushing for a declaration to mark the end of the Korean War, but the North Koreans haven’t agreed and the Biden administration appears lukewarm to the proposal. ""We may have a February or March surprise before the South Korean election if Kim wants to increase the potential for a progressive president to succeed Moon,"" Klingner says. That could include a summit on the sidelines of the Beijing Olympics, a bilateral meeting with Moon or a trilateral meeting involving China but excluding the U.S., he adds. The relative quiet on the missile-testing front could suggest Kim really believes (as he has said) that his nuclear and ICBM programs are complete. Or, given the border closures, Kim could be saving any steps designed to bring the U.S. to the negotiating table on favorable terms for a time when North Korean envoys are actually able to travel to a negotiating table, Klingner says. What to watch: Biden has no plans for Trump-style presidential engagement with Kim. Given the difficulties of dealing with China, Russia and Iran, he may see no news on the North Korea file as good news. But Pyongyang’s pattern of behavior would suggest that the quiet isn't likely to last. Like this article?
