1/25/2022,"As one of society’s oldest art forms, portraiture was traditionally used to convey the power, importance and even wealth of a sitter. Now, one of Britain’s most successful rappers wants to help “change the narrative” around the art form – by shining a spotlight on contemporary heroes instead. In a new six-part series for the BBC, Tinie Tempah, who has had seven No 1 singles in the UK, will match members of the public with “extraordinary stories” to a selection of celebrated portrait artists who will then capture their likeness.  “Historically, portraits have been reserved for high society. We wanted to put a spotlight on our modern-day heroes,” said Tinie – real name Patrick Chukwuemeka Okogwu . “Chances are they’re not going to be elite, upper-class people. They’re going to be regular, everyday people who have done something inspirational or courageous.” Each episode of Extraordinary Portraits follows the process behind capturing the sitters, using different mediums of art – from underwater photography to street art. They culminate in Tinie and the artist unveiling the final piece to the sitter and their family and friends. One of the “heroes” featured in the programme is Patrick Hutchinson, a personal trainer from south London who was photographed carrying an injured English Defence League member to safety during a Black Lives Matter demonstration in 2020 – an image that was hailed as a symbol of unity and humanity. Capturing Hutchinson will be Dale Grimshaw, a painter and street artist who will use a combination of spray cans and oil paint for the portrait. “I remember when that image surfaced of [Hutchinson] carrying that guy out of the protests, and how commendable it was,” Tinie said. “When we revealed the portrait to him and his family, his mum was in tears. It was such a nice moment, to see him being celebrated in a certain type of way.” According to the rapper, a lot of the sitters felt an immense sense of impostor syndrome. “There was a feeling of, ‘wow, I never ever thought something like this would have been done for me’. So I wanted to level the playing field a bit.” The other individuals featured in the programme are Georgia and Melissa Laurie, twins who survived a near fatal crocodile attack while swimming in a lagoon in Mexico; Cee Cee, a model with albinism; Mark Ormrod, a former Royal Marine who survived an explosion during a foot patrol in Afghanistan in 2007; Catrin Pugh, a survivor of a bus crash that left her with burns across 95% of her body; and Alec Burrough, an 88-year-old dairy farmer from Devon. Tinie, who has won Mobos, Brits and an Ivor Novello award, was one of 37 black British stars celebrated in an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in 2018 – with their portraits now part of the gallery’s primary collection. He recalled the “immense pride, inclusion and acknowledgment” he felt after seeing his picture go up in such a revered institution. The rapper, who has a passion for art collecting, said taking part in shows such as this had allowed him to express a different side of himself, which was typically quite hard to do as a rapper. “It’s a way to express my appetite for art that I can’t do in my lyrics,” he said. Suzy Klein, the head of BBC Arts said: “Portraiture has traditionally been a way of commemorating the figures we think of as significant or powerful. What makes Extraordinary Portraits different is that we shift the focus to everyday heroes – shining a light on incredible people whose bravery, courage and good deeds make them truly special, and who we feel deserve to be celebrated.” Extraordinary Portraits starts on BBC One on 14 February.",Arts/Television & radio,Tinie Tempah puts modern heroes in portrait focus for BBC series,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/24/tinie-tempah-puts-modern-heroes-in-portrait-focus-for-bbc-series
1/25/2022,"A Republican-led committee in the Florida state house has advanced a bill that would ban all discussion of sexuality and gender identity in schools, a move advocates say will “erase” LGTBQ+ students and history. The Florida house education and employment committee passed the Parental Rights in Education bill, also known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, last week.  The bill requires the implementation of “procedures to reinforce fundamental right of parents to make decisions regarding upbringing and control of their children”. In addition to allowing parents to launch legal actions against school boards if they believe policies overstep that “fundamental right”, the bill bans teachers from discussing in classrooms LGBTQ+ topics “not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students”. “This bill is about defending the most awesome responsibility a person can have: being a parent,” said the state representative Joe Harding, a Republican who introduced the bill. “That job can only be given to you by above.” In response, Jon Harris Maurer, public policy director for Equality Florida, said: “We’re parents, students and teachers. We are your brothers and sisters. Conversations about us aren’t something dangerous that should be banned. “[This bill] is only talking about sexual orientation and gender identity and it’s stigmatizing because of that. Sexual orientation and gender identity is about who we love and who we are.” Chasten Buttigieg, a n LGBTQ+ advocate who is married to the US secretary of transportation, Pete Buttigieg, condemned Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, tweeting: “This will kill kids … You are purposefully making your state a harder place for LGBTQ+ kids to survive in.” Buttigieg cited data from the Trevor Project, a nonprofit focused on suicide prevention among LGBTQ+ youth. According to a national survey, 42% of LGBTQ+ youth seriously considered suicide last year. Moreover, 94% of LGBTQ+ youth reported that recent politics negatively impacted their mental health. The study also found that LGBTQ+ youth who had access to spaces that affirmed their sexual orientation and gender identity reported lower rates of attempted suicide. In a separate report, the Trevor Project found that LGBTQ+ youth who learned about LGBTQ+ issues or people in classrooms had 23% lower odds of reporting a suicide attempt in the last 12 months. The Trevor Project has condemned the Florida bill, which in a statement last week it said “would effectively erase LGBTQ+ students and history”. Sam Ames, director of advocacy and government affairs at the Trevor Project, said: “This bill will erase young LGBTQ+ students across Florida, forcing many back into the closet by policing their identity and silencing important discussions about the issues they face.”",News/US news,Florida: Republican panel advances bill to ban LGBTQ+ discussion in schools,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/24/florida-republican-committee-dont-say-gay-bill
1/25/2022,"Staff at the UK’s financial watchdog are edging closer to a strike over pay cuts that unions say will turn the Financial Conduct Authority into a “bargain-basement” regulator. Members of Unite will vote in a ballot over whether to take industrial action against the FCA, after management allegedly refused to negotiate with the workforce on a “programme of severe cost-cutting”.  Workers are said to be unhappy about a transformation plan ushered in by the FCA’s new chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, that involves abolishing bonuses widely considered to be part of basic pay, as well as “unfair” changes to the staff appraisal system, plans to cut staff pension rights and lower pay for non-London staff. Unite – which is not formally recognised by the FCA as its staff union – said the plans had already resulted in a plunge in morale and an exodus of experienced staff that could exacerbate problems at the FCA. “Management at the FCA are attempting to implement a programme of pay cuts, which has come after two years in which the staff at the FCA have worked gruelling hours to provide financial protection against Covid for borrowers, investors, small businesses and people with mortgages,” the Unite national officer Dominic Hook said. “Unite has made it clear that if introduced, these cuts will make it even less likely that the FCA will be able to deliver this high standard of public service in the future.” Unite representing staff at the FCA has today launched an indicative ballot of its members for industrial action. Members will vote in a ballot as management refuses to negotiate with the workforce on a programme of severe cost-cutting. @TheFCAhttps://t.co/PvS7mLzy12 The watchdog was already under fire for a number of scandals even before Brexit, which has given more powers and responsibilities to UK regulators. A damning report in 2020 slammed the FCA for failing to properly supervise the mini-bond provider London Capital & Finance before its collapse, which wiped out the savings of 11,600 investors. The FCA was also found to have failed in its regulation of the Connaught Income Fund in 2012, and has faced criticism for failing to intervene before Neil Woodford’s £3.1bn Woodford Equity Income Fund collapsed in 2019. “You cannot regulate the British financial system on a bargain-basement basis as the chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, clearly wishes to do,” Hook said. “Management must enter into immediate negotiations with Unite the Union in order to avoid further damage and risk to the FCA.” Current pay plans will result in the scrapping of bonuses, which Unite says are widely considered part of basic pay, and will result in about 10-12% pay cuts for the majority of its 4,200 staff. However, new pay bands, which include different pay ranges for those based outside London, mean that 800 support and “associate grade” staff, the lowest two tiers, will receive a £3,800 pay rise. The FCA has also offered to increase base salaries by at least 5% for staff below management level who meet performance criteria from April 2022, upping a previous offer for a 2% pay rise. An FCA spokesperson said: “Our pay and reward proposals would ensure the FCA continues to provide one of the best employment packages of any regulator or enforcement agency in the UK. “Our proposals focus on those paid the least, with 800 colleagues below manager-level in line for salary increases of, on average, £3,800. “We are now carefully considering the feedback received during our extensive consultation with colleagues, with the aim of announcing the outcome by March.”",News/Business,UK financial watchdog staff edge closer to strike over pay cuts,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/24/uk-financial-watchdog-staff-edge-closer-to-strike-over-pay-cuts
1/25/2022,"The UK’s equalities watchdog has said it could use its legal powers to act on allegations of Islamophobia made by the former Tory minister Nusrat Ghani. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is under pressure to launch an investigation into alleged anti-Muslim hatred in the Conservative party after Ghani’s claims. In an interview published in the Sunday Times, she alleged that her “Muslimness” was raised when she was removed from a ministerial job in 2020 and she was told it was “making colleagues uncomfortable”.  The watchdog said that while it welcomed the announcement that the Cabinet Office was launching an inquiry into Ghani’s allegations, “if we are not satisfied with progress, we will not rule out the use of our legal powers.” An inquiry by the Conservatives published in May 2021 was condemned as a whitewash by Muslim Tories and anti-racist groups. While many welcomed the conclusion of the review, chaired by Prof Swaran Singh, that anti-Muslim sentiment “remains a problem” in the party, they disagreed with the finding that there was no evidence of institutional racism. An EHRC spokesperson said: “We have been monitoring the progress of the action plan from Prof Swaran Singh’s independent investigation into alleged discrimination within the Conservative and Unionist party, which was published in May 2021. We have received regular updates from the party and have liaised with them on their progress.” The Muslim Council of Britain said a “truly independent” inquiry into the “state of instititional Islamophobia in the Conservative party” was needed. A spokesperson for the group called on the EHRC to launch one, saying it should “rise to fulfil [its] obligations” and it was a “litmus test” for the watchdog. Mohammed Amin, a former chair of the Conservative Muslim Forum, said: “I do believe the EHRC needs to investigate the Conservative party for its handling of discrimination against Muslim members and mostly elected Muslim officials, parliamentarians etc. In the same way that it investigated the Labour party about the [its] handling of antisemitism.” He said failure to intervene could result in the body losing the confidence of British Muslims. “It’s the duty of the EHRC to investigate the health of our political parties,” he said. Amina Shareef, an advisory panel member of Muslim Engagement and Development (Mend), said: “With the continued inability of the Conservative party to tackle Islamophobia in its ranks, including at the highest levels, it is high time for the EHRC to heed calls from the Muslim community to finally launch its own investigation. The EHRC’s failure to do so is leading to questions around its impartiality amongst many within the Muslim community.” Despite Ghani’s demand for a specific terms of reference to be published for the Cabinet Office inquiry that included “all that was said in Downing Street and by the whip” alleged to have made the comments, the Guardian has been told the government is unlikely to do so. Cabinet Office sources suggested the matter would be investigated through the standard process used by the propriety and ethics team, though it kept open the possibility that the prime minister’s ethics adviser, Christopher Geidt, could get involved if there was a suggestion the ministerial code had been broken. Meanwhile, Qari Asim, the deputy chair of the government’s anti-Muslim hate working group and an independent adviser appointed in 2019 to lead government work to define Islamophobia, criticised the government for failing to meaningfully engage. He said there had not “been any engagement from the government” on coming up with a definition for Islamophobia for several years. “It is extraordinarily critical that we have a workable definition of Islamophobia as soon as possible,” he said. “It’s important for a number of reasons, but firstly that will identify what is acceptable or unacceptable behaviour.” He added: “I’m heartened when senior ministers and the prime minister say that there’s a zero tolerance towards Islamophobia, anti-Muslim hatred, and that’s absolutely great. At the same time, I think we need to walk the talk, and we need to take concrete urgent steps to define what the redline boundaries are, which are acceptable to different sections of the society, including the government.”",News/Politics,EHRC threatens to intervene over Tory Islamophobia claims,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/24/ehrc-threatens-to-intervene-over-tory-islamophobia-claims
1/25/2022,"A menacing steel barn outside the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius where CIA terror suspects were once held in solitary confinement, subjected to constant light and high-intensity noise, is soon to go on the market. The government’s real estate fund, which handles assets no longer needed by the state, said on Monday it was preparing to sell the notorious former “black site”, known as Project No 2 or Detention Site Violet, for an as-yet unknown price.  Part of Washington’s secret “extraordinary rendition” programme – in which suspected Islamist militants from conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq were captured and held in jails outside the US – the 10-room building served as a detention centre in 2005 and 2006. In its windowless and soundproofed rooms, “one could do whatever one wanted”, Arvydas Anusauskas, who led a Lithuanian parliamentary investigation into the site in 2010, told Reuters. “What exactly was going on there, we did not determine.” Lithuania’s top tourist attraction is a former Russian KGB jail in central Vilnius where 767 people were executed during an anti-Soviet uprising in the 1940s and thousands were tortured, but there are no plans to turn the former CIA facility, which has its own power generator and water supply, into a museum. “We don’t push any buttons, so as not to turn anything on by accident,” an employee of the real estate fund said of the facility, where fluorescent lighting and the hum of air conditioning dominate the now-empty rooms. The European court of human rights heard in 2018 that prisoners at the site, used as a training facility by Lithuania’s intelligence service from 2007 until 2018, were shaved on arrival and blindfolded or hooded, with their legs shackled. Earlier this month it was revealed that the Lithuanian government had paid Abu Zubaydah, the so-called “forever prisoner”, €100,000 ($113,319) in compensation for the treatment he suffered at the site, following the court’s ruling that the government had violated European laws banning torture. Zubaydah, was captured in Pakistan six months after 9/11, accused of being a senior member of al-Qaida, and has been held without charge ever since. He is unlikely to have suffered the most brutal forms of torture in Lithuania that the CIA applied elsewhere – he was waterboarded 83 times in a single month in Thailand – but he was subjected to sensory and sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, loud noise and harsh light. A summary of the US Senate’s report into the CIA’s torture program released in 2014 referred to “Site Violet”, though it withheld the identity of the country in which the building was based. The creation of the site prompted tensions between different elements of the Bush administration, with the US ambassador to Lithuania complaining bitterly that the state department had been cut out of the planning process and kept in the dark. The Senate report also noted that by the time the black site was opened, CIA personnel were suffering “mission fatigue vis-a-vis their interaction with the program” – a reference to the trauma that agents experienced as a result of participating in torture. The detainees who were brought there had also been subjected already to so much “enhanced interrogation” – the CIA’s euphemism for torture – that many had been “all but drained of actionable intelligence”. The CIA and lawyers for the Bush administration attempted to justify Zubaydah’s torture by claiming he was a very senior figure in al-Qaida, but it emerged he was not a member of the organisation. Other prisoners held at the site included Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-professed mastermind of the 11 September 2001 attacks, ruled that the government had violated European laws banning the use of torture. The site was closed in 2006 after Lithuania refused to admit a third prisoner, Mustafa al-Hawsawi, to hospital. All three men are still in detention at the US detention centre in Guantánamo Bay.",News/World news,For sale: CIA ‘black site’ where terror suspects were tortured in Lithuania,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/for-sale-cia-black-site-terror-suspects-tortured-lithuania
1/25/2022,"Another day, another inquiry into alleged serious misbehaviour in Boris Johnson’s Downing Street operation. The prime minister’s decision to order a Cabinet Office investigation into allegations of Islamophobia by the Conservative MP Nusrat Ghani is welcome. But as Mr Johnson braces for a tumultuous week in which Sue Gray’s report on “partygate” could conceivably bring him down, it will partly have been motivated by a desire to kick this latest crisis into the long grass. Given the importance of the issues raised by Ms Ghani, their significance must not be lost in the chaos of an administration incapable of focusing on anything bar its own survival. Ms Ghani claimed in a weekend interview that after she was sacked from a ministerial role in 2020, she was told by a government whip in Downing Street that her “Muslimness” had become a problem, and that her “Muslim woman minister status was making colleagues feel uncomfortable”. She also asserts she was told that, as a Muslim Conservative, she had not done enough to defend the party from widespread allegations of Islamophobia. These allegations have been vehemently denied by the chief whip, Mark Spencer, who identified himself on Twitter as the politician Ms Ghani was referring to. They are deeply shocking because they allege that as a female member of a minority group, Ms Ghani was effectively being told by the government that her face didn’t fit and she wasn’t doing enough to ensure that it did. When she complained to Mr Johnson over her treatment, the prime minister blithely refused to treat it as a government matter and directed her to internal party complaints procedures.  It will be for the inquiry to establish exactly what took place. But that the Conservative party has a long-running problem with Islamophobia is beyond question. Last year a YouGov poll found that nearly half of party members judged Islam to be “a threat to the British way of life”. Ms Ghani has already received forthright support from the health secretary, Sajid Javid, whose previous demands for an inquiry into anti-Muslim discrimination in the party resulted in the Singh investigation, published last summer. This criticised Zac Goldsmith’s scurrilous attempts to link Sadiq Khan to Islamist extremism during the London mayoral race of 2016, and Mr Johnson’s offensive “letterbox” disparagement of veiled Muslim women in a newspaper column. Two-thirds of allegations of discrimination in the Tory party were found to relate to Islamophobia, in what was found to be a flawed complaints process. But the report failed to examine the deep-rooted patterns of prejudice to which figures such as Sayeeda Warsi have repeatedly pointed and, unlike Labour and the Lib Dems, Mr Johnson’s Conservative party continues to refuse to sign up to the all-party parliamentary group definition of Islamophobia. The cumulative impression is of a party that only bothers to stir when a scandal bursts out in the open. Ms Ghani’s decision to go public, after almost two years of anguished silence, should be the catalyst for a robust process of self-examination at all levels of the party – one equivalent to that undertaken on antisemitism by the Labour party. The vocal solidarity expressed by Mr Javid and the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, suggests that a more diverse generation of senior Tories may be better positioned to drive through the cultural transformation that is so badly required. British Muslims will not hold their breath, but change cannot come soon enough.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Tory Islamophobia: the rot starts at the top | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/24/the-guardian-view-on-tory-islamophobia-the-rot-starts-at-the-top
1/25/2022,"Benefit levels are set too low. The social security budget was £36bn less in 2019 than in 2010, and the basic rate of out-of-work benefits is at its lowest for 30 years. Repeated freezes combined with the benefit cap and two-child limit, and rising housing costs, have hit millions of households hard. The consequences have included massive rises in the number of people needing support from food banks and other forms of crisis support, even before the pandemic. The prospect of energy price rises has led to warnings that more households face horrendous decisions about whether to “heat or eat”. Research by the campaigning food writer Jack Monroe on supermarket basics ranges shows that price increases on the lowest-cost items have far outstripped averages. The price of the cheapest pasta in a local branch of Asda, for example, has risen 141% in a single year.  Lifting working-age benefits by about 6% in April, instead of the 3.1% that is planned, would cost around £3bn a year in total. If the rise were applied to pensions as well, the cost would be £4.5bn. The Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank has warned that the alternative is a £290 real-terms fall in the value of benefits for around 10m households. With lone parents and their children, children with two or more siblings, disabled people, unpaid carers and single pensioners the most likely people to be poor – the shocking figure for children in three-child families is 47% – it ought to be clear that there is a limit to what incentives for work can achieve. As a report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation put it last week, what ought to be a “poverty-fighting social security system” has become, at least in part, a poverty-reinforcing one. The £20 uplift in universal credit offered some relief during the pandemic, although it never reached those claimants who had not made the switch to UC from the old system. Cutting it in the autumn was a mistake by the government and recognised as such by Tory former welfare secretaries as well as the government’s opponents. The effect has been mitigated for some households by other changes, including a reduction in the taper rate (meaning that in-work claimants can hold on to more of their earnings). But others will see their incomes shrink, while inflation is predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility to remain above 3% until 2023. Under Conservative prime ministers since David Cameron, keeping benefits as low as possible has been a central aim of welfare policy. Universal credit worked reasonably well from a technical point of view during the pandemic, with millions of new claims processed. System flaws such as the lengthy wait for initial payments remain. So does the potential for future disasters caused by the punitive sanctions regime, which has led to numerous deaths already. But with 22% of the population, or 14.5 million people, living in poverty even before the pandemic, and 2.4 million of these experiencing the most severe form of poverty, known as destitution, the most important point is that the social security system does not support people – including millions of those who are not expected to work, either because they are children, pensioners, disabled, or carers – by providing them with enough money to live on. The results, including children going hungry, are needlessly cruel and destructive. Benefits need to increase.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on benefit levels: the only way is up | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/24/the-guardian-view-on-benefit-levels-the-only-way-is-up
1/25/2022,"Carrie Johnson threw a surprise birthday party for Boris Johnson during the first lockdown, despite the rules forbidding social gatherings indoors, according to ITV. Downing Street has admitted the prime minister attended the gathering in the cabinet room at No 10 with up to 30 people at 2pm on 19 June 2020, but denied reports he held a birthday party later in the Downing Street residence.  ITV News reported that the interior designer, Lulu Lytle – who was not a member of No 10 staff – attended the gathering. Lytle was the designer tasked with renovating Johnson’s flat in Downing Street, which became the subject of significant controversy after a donor was asked to fund the refurbishment. Staffers brought the prime minister a birthday cake and picnic food from M&S, with the gathering lasting 20-30 minutes. Number 10 said he attended for less than 10 minutes.

He was there for less than 10 minutes.” Regarding the later party in the flat, a spokesman said: “This is totally untrue.

1/25/2022,"British producers have raised fears of beer and burger shortages and higher prices for shoppers after the government said it would stop propping up the CO2 industry. A three-month deal to support the UK’s main producer of the gas, brought in as an emergency measure after a crisis in the autumn, ends next week and it is understood it will not be renewed.  The government provided a temporary bailout to CF Fertilisers, which accounts for 60% of the UK’s CO2 supplies, to counter the threat of chaos in supply chains, after its US owner shut its factories amid the soaring cost of natural gas. Any holdup in supplies would affect soft drinks and bakery producers as well as meat processors and brewers, who all use CO2 in making and packaging their goods. It is understood that the government, which pumped in money for three weeks in September before facilitating the current industry deal, has said it will not put up further cash. The deal was supposed to create time for alternative sources of food grade CO2 to be developed, but industry insiders said there had been little progress. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), said: “It is for the CO2 industry to ensure supplies to UK businesses.” The current deal supported a UK fertiliser plant, based in Billingham in Stockton-on-Tees, which is one of the main producers of food-grade CO2, until 31 January. Further production is reliant on a successful deal between CF Industries, the US owner of the plant, and the UK distributors of the gas, Nippon Gases and Air Liquide. CF, whose Billingham plant can produce 750 tonnes of CO2 per day, told the Guardian on Monday that it was continuing to negotiate with its industrial gas customers. At a meeting with leading food and drink industry figures on Friday, the government said there was a “reasonable chance” of the talks being successful. Its fall-back plan involves relying on imports and a smaller plant operated by Nippon. In that case, CO2 supplies will be prioritised for the NHS, the nuclear industry and pork and poultry slaughter, which account for about a quarter of food-grade CO2 use. Stephen Livens of the British Beer and Pub Association told the meeting that the prospect of a further interruption in supplies was “pretty terrifying” and the UK brewing industry would be in “serious trouble” if it was largely reliant on imports of CO2. The gas is used to can and bottle beer, clean equipment and in systems that shift beer around a brewery, making it a vital ingredient for the industry. He warned there would be an impact on consumers, particularly as demand for beer increases over the summer and brewers were already absorbing a 10% to 15% rise in the operational costs of beer-making. with little sign of that reversing. “A strategic solution has to work for everybody, not just the priority list,” Livens said. James Calder of the Society of Independent Brewers told the meeting: “For us the situation is perilous,” adding that the price of CO2 had already risen by up to 400% for some businesses. Tony Goodger of the Association of Independent Meat Suppliers said increased CO2 costs would only add to inflation for shoppers of both food and drink. He said his members were stocking up on CO2 in case of any issues from next week. He told Defra: “In a World Cup year, demand for alcohol and meat products [will be higher]. We do need a solution in place by Qatar 22 [in November].” A spokesperson for the Food and Drink Federation trade body said: “We are concerned that with just days now remaining before that agreement comes to an end, and energy prices still very high, there will be further CO2 shortages once again. “This could lead to shortages in the products we find on our supermarket shelves – adding further pressures to families already coping with high food-price inflation. “We will continue to work with the government on this. It is critical that together we ensure supply can continue and that we build long-term resilience into the production of food-grade CO2.”",News/Business,Food and drink shortages possible as UK support for CO2 industry ends,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/24/food-and-drink-shortages-possible-as-uk-support-for-co2-industry-ends
1/25/2022,"Amid Boris Johnson’s recent travails, one Tory MP recounted how he, like many colleagues, was phoned by an ally of the prime minister seeking to shore up his support. Asked what changes No 10 should consider, the answer was immediate: scrap the planned national insurance rise and cut VAT on energy bills. “Boris’s people have been ringing up a lot of us to hear what we they think, and as I understand it, every single MP is basically telling them to get a grip with taxes and the cost of living,” the MP said.  The VAT cut is among a series of measures on a long list of options being considered by the Treasury, although no decision is expected imminently, as everyone in government awaits Sue Gray’s report on Downing Street parties. But amid the public chaos, another behind-the-scenes battle is being fought on the scheduled 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance contributions, unveiled in September as a way to provide £12bn a year extra to reduce NHS waiting lists and, in the longer term, pay sustainably for social care. While the move broke a Conservative manifesto pledge to not raise taxes, the rise was sold as necessary given the unprecedented pressures of Covid, and only five Tory MPs rebelled in a Commons vote. But with inflation above 5%, and Tory MPs aware they have greater leverage with a prime minister battling for his political future, there is increasing speculation that a U-turn could happen. Both Downing Street and the Treasury still reject the idea that they are considering such a change, with the latter in particular dismissing the mooted idea that Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is now not keen on the plan. “[Sunak, Sajid Javid, the health secretary] and the PM all stood up at a press conference and announced it together. It’s ludicrous that he’d disown it,” one source said. “Some MPs are saying they want to delay it, but you can’t really say that without also saying when it should be delayed to, and where the money will come from for the NHS backlog and social care.” No 10 sources are similarly adamant that nothing is being planned, while Johnson’s spokesman insisted on Monday that the PM is still fully behind what he termed the “right approach to tackle this long-standing problem”. It was, however, notable that during a pooled TV clip during a visit to a hospital on Monday, Johnson seemed more keen to defend the basis for the plan than to confirm it will come into effect in April, as planned. “What I’m telling people is that if you want to fund our fantastic NHS, we have to pay for it. And this government is determined to do so,” Johnson said, giving several variations of this sentiment – while declining eight invitations by the reporter to say the plan and timetable remained the same. A series of government sources acknowledge that while No 10 remains publicly committed to the NI plan, Johnson is coming under intense pressure from his MPs, and also that when ministers and whips try to get backbenchers onside, all sorts of promises might be made. Several cabinet ministers, including Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, have publicly expressed doubt about the national insurance plan, while others, such as the education secretary Nadhim Zahawi, are seen as sympathetic to a delay should it happen. All this is hardly like to put off a growing contingent of Tory backbenchers who hope for a change of heart on cost of living issues. Earlier this month, Johnson told the Commons he did not support a cut in VAT on fuel bills, and now it is being considered.
