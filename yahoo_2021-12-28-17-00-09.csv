12/28/2021,"With over 1 billion users, it’s perhaps no surprise that TikTok has become something of a haven for awesome iPhone tips and tricks. So while it may seem unusual, TikTok is brimming with videos highlighting awesome and hidden iPhone hacks. The latest example is something you need to see to believe. Actually, it’s something you need to hear to believe. Recently, folks on TikTok unearthed something of a sneaky iPhone hack that enables users to listen in on conversations from nearly 50 feet away. Interestingly enough, this iPhone hack went viral after it was highlighted by actress Elizabeth Henstridge who you might know as Jemma Simmons from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Everyone loves Marvel content right these days, and now we’re even bigger fans of this particular Marvel series. Today's Top Deals The Best Deals Online Today (December 2021) Brand new AirPods Pro with MagSafe have a massive holiday discount you won't believe Price mistake alert: Amazon's $1 smart home device has a deeper discount than it's supposed to! Don't Miss: Monday’s deals: COVID-19 tests, 99¢ Amazon Smart Plug, $50 Amazon gift card deal, more The basic gist of this trick is that you can set up your iPhone to always be in a “listening” state. From there, you can have the audio picked up by your iPhone and transmitted right back to your AirPods. Note that this iPhone trick also works with regular AirPods, Powerbeats, and AirPods Max. Admittedly, it’s only natural to view this iPhone hack in the context of listening in on other peoples’ conversations. Still, it’s worth bringing to your attention as something of a safety warning. Specifically, if you see a random iPhone just laying around, don’t assume it’s safe to talk about sensitive information. Apple describes the purpose of this feature as follows: With Live Listen, your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch can act like a microphone that sends sound to your AirPods, AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, Powerbeats Pro, or Beats Fit Pro. Live Listen can help you hear a conversation in a noisy area or even hear someone speaking across the room. To get started with this iPhone hack, make sure your AirPods are out and active. Next, select Settings > Control Center > Customize Controls. Once you do this, you’ll see a list of apps that reside in the Control Center. You’ll also see apps that aren’t in Control Center. Keep on scrolling and you’ll see an option that says Hearing. Once you select that, hit the green plus icon whereupon it will now appear in the Control Center. Following that, you’ll see an ear icon at the bottom of the screen when you call Control Center into action by swiping down from the top of the screen. If you tap the ear icon, you’ll see an option that reads “Live Listen.” Tap that once and any sound the iPhone picks up will be sent back to your AirPods if you’re in range. The following instructional illustration from Apple might make things clearer: If you’re having trouble setting this up, there’s no reason to fret. In this scenario, simply check that your Bluetooth is turned on and that your headphones are charged. And lastly, the TikTok video that popularized this iPhone hack is viewable below: so basically we’re all spies now?!

12/28/2021,"The father of a teenager suspected of breaking into the grounds of Windsor Castle on Christmas Day carrying a crossbow said “something has gone horribly wrong” with his son. Jaswant Singh Chail, 19, apparently shared a video in which he threatened to “assassinate the Queen” just minutes before he was arrested at her Berkshire residence. He was sectioned under the Mental Health Act on Boxing Day. Police are investigating the footage, which shows a masked man holding a black crossbow and threatening to kill the Queen in revenge for the Amritsar massacre in 1919. The video was uploaded to Snapchat at 8.06am on Christmas Day, 24 minutes before a man was apprehended by Windsor security after scaling a fence with a rope ladder. Members of the Royal Family including the Queen are thought to have been inside the castle at the time. The suspect was the fifth person to have breached security at Windsor in the past nine months. His father, Jasbir Singh Chail, said: “Something's gone horribly wrong with our son and we are trying to figure out what. “We've not had a chance to speak to him but are trying to get him the help he needs. From our perspective, we are going through a difficult time. We are trying to resolve this issue and it's not easy.” In the video, a man wearing a dark hoodie and mask makes threats using a distorted voice. He makes repeated references to Star Wars and appears to give his name as “Darth Jones”. He says: “I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I've done and what I will do. I will attempt to assassinate Elizabeth, Queen of the Royal Family. This is revenge for those who have died in the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre. “It is also revenge for those who have been killed, humiliated and discriminated on because of their race. I'm an Indian Sikh, a Sith.” The Sith are villains in the Star Wars movies, while a character on the wall behind the suspect is thought to be Darth Malgus, an obscure character from fiction written around the Star Wars films. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Massacre of Amritsar, took place on April 19, 1919. British troops opened fire on a large crowd of unarmed Indians in the Punjab region of India, which was then under British colonial rule, killing hundreds and causing over a thousand casualties. Pictures posted on social media appear to show members of the suspect’s family visiting Amritsar in 2018. His parents are the registered directors of an IT firm and live with the teenager and his twin sister in a house on a private estate in the village of North Baddesley, near Southampton. It’s been revealed a 19-year-old intruder who was arrested in the grounds of Windsor Castle was armed with a crossbow – and it’s claimed he intended to assassinate the Queen. https://t.co/gYFVWBqbT0 @MKarstunen #7NEWS pic.twitter.com/cYpXXfWYOP — 7NEWS Adelaide (@7NewsAdelaide) December 27, 2021 One resident said the ""lovely family"" were ""perfect neighbours"", adding that they saw Jaswant only to say hello to as he walked to college. Police yesterday remained at the teenager's home, where he lives with his parents and twin sister. The detached property is on a small estate where house prices can reach £500,000. Neighbours said they visited the property on Boxing Day afternoon. The suspect, who the police have not formally named, was arrested with the weapon after apparently using a rope ladder to scale a metal fence to enter the gardens at the Queen’s Berkshire residence. It is understood he was spotted on CCTV “within moments”, triggering a team of armed response officers to arrest him just hours before the Queen was due to celebrate Christmas with her family. According to a source, once he had gained access to the royal estate, the teenager 'didn't know what to do with himself' and was quickly detained. About an hour after the Christmas Day arrest, the Queen welcomed Prince Charles and Camilla to the castle. The Earl and Countess of Wessex along with their children, Lady Louise, 18, and Viscount Severn, 14, also attended a Christmas Matins service at Windsor Castle. The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester also visited the castle for the service at the private chapel. The Queen, 95, was having Christmas at Windsor instead of Sandringham due to concerns over the spread of the new Covid variant. The security breach is likely to lead to a review by police to establish what lessons can be learned from the incident. Two weeks ago, a woman was arrested after she ran up to Prince Andrew’s car and banged on the window. The security breach happened as the Duke of York drove into the Windsor estate. In April, a 44-year-old woman who claimed to be engaged to Prince Andrew was let into his official Windsor residence by security guards. The smartly-dressed Spanish woman was said to have wandered around the grounds of his Grade II listed Royal Lodge in Great Windsor Park. She has since been sectioned under the 1984 Mental Health Act. A review was also carried out in 2003 after self-styled comedy terrorist Aaron Barschak broke in during Prince William's 21st birthday party. Scotland Yard has confirmed detectives were ""assessing the contents of a video"" following the arrest of a 19-year-old man from Southampton.
