5/19/2022,"Frank Lampard has said Crystal Palace’s visit to Goodison Park could be pivotal to shaping Everton’s future as his team attempt to secure their Premier League status. Everton would avoid a first relegation since 1951 with a win against Patrick Vieira’s team on Thursday. Anything less, however, and their fight to avoid the drop will go to the final day at Arsenal. Lampard denied Palace represented an “all-or-nothing” game, on the basis his side could get something at Arsenal, but admitted: “Historically it could be a big night for us because we know the situation.” The manager said: “I’m certainly not overplaying the idea of a relegation battle as if that is something to get excited about. It is just that, with the situation we are in, it is absolutely pivotal to the future of the club in the short term to get the results we need to stay in the league. Also football is about moments and about the opportunity for the players, the staff and the fans to come together and share a moment that means a lot to the club. And we shouldn’t understate that. “It won’t be cause for huge celebrations if we get the right result but at the same time everyone is fighting in the same direction for something, so we have understand what a big night that could be for the club.” Everton have missed two opportunities to reach safety, drawing at relegated Watford and losing at home to Brentford on Sunday when they had Jarrad Branthwaite and Salomón Rondón sent off. That has intensified the pressure on their final home game of an arduous campaign but Lampard believes his squad have the mentality to cope after they responded in similar circumstances to beat Manchester United and Chelsea at Goodison recently. “You have to approach every game differently in terms of the opponents,” he said. “Against Chelsea there was an expectancy to have only 30% possession and we had to defend very well and accept their passing and style. Man United was different, Palace will be different. We understand their threats. “There’s probably more onus on us against Palace to show more attacking intent and probably have a bit more possession and be higher up the pitch. So it is different in that sense but in terms of the attitude, yes, we want the same attitude as we approached Man United, Chelsea, Leicester, even Liverpool and Man City because we approached them with absolutely the right attitude. “It is really obvious what is at stake in this game, and the last two games, and the size of this game can’t be lost on anyone.”",Sport/Football,"Everton survival could hinge on Crystal Palace result, says Frank Lampard",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/18/everton-survival-could-hinge-on-crystal-palace-result-says-frank-lampard
5/19/2022,"The final series of Derry Girls (Channel 4) has been a triumph. Rather than resting on its laurels, it pushed itself to new heights. From its celebrity cameos – classy, sparing, and in the last ever episode, it’s fair to say surprising – to its playful decision to mix up genres, each week has been delightful. I loved the episode set almost entirely on a train, the “haunted” house trip, and the school reunion flashback to Sarah and Mary’s youth, movingly dedicated to “all the mammies”, which was so good that fans have been calling for a spinoff series. It is a rare comedy that bows out on a high like this, but Derry Girls has been bold in its victory lap. It has earned its right, then, to say a protracted farewell with not one but two episodes. The first is a classic caper, fittingly doing what the show does best by getting the gang of five into a scrape then letting them make it far worse for themselves. Fatboy Slim, or Slimboy Fat, depending who you ask, is playing in Derry on Halloween, and the girls (and I do include the wee English fella in this, as is only right and fair) will simply die if they don’t get tickets. The trouble is that a local hardman stands in the way of them and their Rockafeller Skanks. It’s the ultimate in 90s nostalgia, from its soundtrack to the Claire Danes in Romeo and Juliet idolisation to queueing at a record shop to pick up tickets made out of paper. James has to fight for the girls’ honour, which goes as well as you’d think, while Michelle gets stuck in as only she knows how: by lying through her teeth. Even Clare is finally free to be her wee lesbian self. (To its credit, Derry Girls has tried to make a virtue out of Nicola Coughlan’s clear lack of availability for filming, owing to a Bridgerton clash; almost every episode has involved a guessing game as to how Clare might not make it to whatever mess they’ve got themselves caught up in.) As well as brilliant buffoonery, Derry Girls has found a new-ish emotional maturity, and I admit to getting choked up on more than one occasion. It pulls at the heartstrings but avoids being too cheesy, so when it goes for the big dramatic moments, it almost always lands them. Episode six builds to one of those moments, but it could not have been the way they planned to end it. For a comedy so good at silliness – just watch what Orla is doing at any given moment, even when she’s not speaking – it would have been too sad to leave it like that. Thankfully, the hour-long final episode, set one year later in 1998, wraps it all up with a perfect proportion of light and shade. It is Orla and Erin’s joint 18th birthday party, and the Good Friday agreement referendum is taking place. There are huge lessons to be learned about compromise, and difficult decisions in all areas of life. Orla, for example, wants a monkey-themed party, while Erin wants it to be literary greats. “Find a middle ground, girls,” says Aunt Sarah. “Like, literary monkeys.” The middle ground proves elusive, on many levels. The budget for Erin and Orla’s party does not quite match their expectations, and the history-making referendum is stealing their thunder. This does not downplay the magnitude of the shifting political landscape (and what better time to be reminded of it) but plays it out as it affects ordinary people’s lives, which is smart and touching. Michelle and Erin row about which way they are going to vote, and it pitches into drama again, refusing to shy away from grave topics. But it always comes back to the comedy. You’d think it might be difficult to make a debate about paramilitary prisoners into a joke, but the pieces just fit together. And if there is a funnier scene on TV this year than Jenny’s commemorative Choose Hope play, put on for the school assembly to Sister Michael’s utter despair, I would be very surprised. It took a while for Derry Girls to establish itself as that rare thing, a modern comedy classic, but now it feels like it has always been there. There’s a strong sense that though it will be missed, it hasn’t outstayed its welcome. Instead, it has been absolutely cracker.",Arts/Television & radio,Derry Girls finale review – absolutely cracker ,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/18/derry-girls-finale-review-absolutely-cracker
5/19/2022,"Good morning. Aged care Covid deaths soar in Australia, Muslim Australians abandon Labor in key marginals and the US pledges Nato cooperation with Finland and Sweden. Covid deaths inside aged care facilities are occurring at rates unseen during the first two years of the pandemic, as government data reveals at least 60 people are dying a week, with more than 350 deaths since the start of the election campaign. Aged care works are preparing to strike tomorrow, citing frustration about low pay, heightened workforce pressures and workload. Scott Morrison has described every death as a “terrible loss” but explained that the high number of deaths is due to people dying “with Covid” but not necessarily “because of Covid”. Anthony Albanese flagged a new national strategy to reduce the deaths if Labor wins the election. Virologists, meanwhile, have accused both Labor and the Liberals of failing to address slowing booster uptake rates amid a creeping “complacency” in pandemic planning. As the federal election enter its final few days, Guardian Australia looks back at what we learned from visiting marginal electorates across the country. While one voter in a Tasmanian marginal seat described the two would-be prime ministers as “two cheeks, same arsehole”, Guardian staff have identified seven key policy areas in which the main parties diverge. In western Sydney, Muslim Australians have expressed frustration at Labor taking “our community for granted for so many years”, with a younger generation of Muslim voters considering alternatives. And, in case you were wondering, the child Scott Morrison knocked over on the soccer field in Devonport last night is fine. The US will work with Finland and Sweden in the event of a “threat of aggression” as the two nations edge closer to Nato membership. President Joe Biden said the US would maintain its “robust exercise activity and presence” in the Baltic Sea region, and counter “any threats to our shared security”. In Ukraine the treatment of nearly 1,000 soldiers from Mariupol’s besieged Azovstal steel plant is unclear, with the Kremlin confirming they’ve been sent to a prison colony in a Russian-controlled area of the Donetsk region. A Russian soldier has pleaded guilty to shooting an unarmed civilian during the first war crimes trial in Kyiv. More than 10,000 cases have been registered over the past few months. The number of Australians turning to crowdfunding to secure their accommodation has quadrupled in the past year in the face of dramatic rent increases and low vacancy rates in major cities across the country. The rate of tropical rainforest die-off has doubled since the 1980s, with research suggesting global heating could see forests releasing more carbon dioxide than they absorb. Burnout is driving an increasing number of healthcare staff out of hospitals in regional NSW, with policy failure at state and federal level “forcing many GPs to close up shop”. The EU is planning to commit €210bn over five years to end its reliance on Russian oil and gas, announcing a major increase in solar and wind power and a target of 45% renewables by 2030. Sudanese refugees fleeing massacres will be forcibly returned to Rwanda by the UK Home Office, with asylum seekers being issued “notices of intent” under a controversial new policy. Cryptocurrency crashes will not reduce the sector’s environmental footprint, Dutch researchers have suggested, with energy-intensive rates of “mining” remaining steady, despite nearly $1tn being wiped off the sector in the past month. “It was 2010 and DVD sales in Australia were booming.” Olivia Bennett and her mum had stumbled across an absolute bargain: five VHS cassettes for 50c at Lifeline; and after multiple trips they were well on their way to a thousand-strong collection of their favourite films – from Jim Henson’s Labyrinth to Pete’s Dragon. Michael Sun talks to several “collectors” and finds that there’s “something about a physical medium – the tactility of it … There’s just something innately comforting about that.” When Australians go to the polls this Saturday, their real wages will be about the same rate as they were when Tony Abbott took office in 2013. As Greg Jericho explains: “It really does put all talk about a strong recovery from the pandemic into context. Yes, GDP has recovered, and yes unemployment has fallen, but the ability of workers to buy things with their wages has fallen.” Geraldine Quinn bought her family’s first dial-up modem so it’s safe to say she was in on the ground floor when it comes to online giggles. And as our guest curator for this week’s 10 funniest things on the internet she’s delivering Alex Jones as you’ve never seen him before. The case for a federal anti-corruption commission: It’s a broken promise that has dogged the Morrison government, while Anthony Albanese says he’ll have one in place before 2022 is out, if Labor wins office. On this episode of Full Story, chief political correspondent Sarah Martin explains why the watchdog is needed.

With Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson recalled, and Matthew Potts and Harry Brooks promoted, there’s also a new-look No 3 batsman who has tongues wagging. Workers face a $4,000 real wage cut as inflation outstrips wage growth, the Sydney Morning Herald writes.

And the ABC reports on a 130% increase in flu cases in Queensland. Anthony Albanese will release Labor’s policy costings. The Chris Dawson murder trial continues in Sydney. It was bought for a few hundred quid for its striking illustration, consisting of bats and cranes. But an extremely rare 18th century Chinese vase from the court of the Qianlong emperor has gone under the hammer at auction for almost £1.5m. Not bad for a “decorative thing” bought on a whim.

5/19/2022,"Twenty years after he famously blasted God Save the Queen from the roof of Buckingham Palace, guitarist Brian May and his Queen bandmates will join the UK’s Eurovision star Sam Ryder among headline acts at the platinum jubilee concert, it has been announced. Queen and Adam Lambert will open the BBC’s Platinum Party at the Palace concert with a special performance marking the actual Queen’s 70 years on the throne. May stole the show with his surprise rooftop appearance for the golden jubilee concert in June 2002. He said: “Twenty years after playing the Queen’s glorious golden jubilee, we’re very happy to be invited again. Then there was a moment when I wondered … after Buckingham Palace roof, where can you go? Well … you will see.” Alicia Keys, Nile Rodgers and Andrea Bocelli will also perform during the three-stage, two-and-a-half-hour event on Saturday 4 June. The lineup will also include Duran Duran, the Bond composer Hans Zimmer, Ella Eyre, Craig David, Mabel, Elbow and George Ezra. Ryder, who came second at the Eurovision contest in Italy on Saturday with the song Space Man, the UK’s best result in 24 years, will also perform live. Sir Elton John will appear in a pre-recorded performance. Soul legend Diana Ross, who has not performed in the UK for 15 years, will close the event with a live performance. She said: “I have had the honour of meeting the Queen many times throughout my life, including when I was with my family. “Her Majesty has and continues to be such an incredible inspiration to so many across the world and I was absolutely delighted to receive an invitation to perform on such a momentous and historic occasion.” The evening will feature appearances from sports figures and stars of the stage and screen, including Sir David Attenborough, Dame Julie Andrews, Stephen Fry, the tennis player Emma Raducanu, the former footballer David Beckham, the Paralympian swimmer Ellie Simmonds and the Royal Ballet. The dance troupe and Britain’s Got Talent winners Diversity will also perform. The evening would highlight global themes that had emerged or evolved during the Queen’s reign, organisers said, and would include British and Commonwealth contributions in the fields of fashion, sport, the environment, pop music and musicals. The latter section will be curated by Andrew Lloyd Webber and include a special appearance by the Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, plus performances featuring the casts of The Phantom of the Opera, Hamilton, Six, The Lion King and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Coverage will be led by Kirsty Young and Roman Kemp, with 22,000 people attending. Ten thousand tickets will be allocated in a public ballot, with 7,500 for key workers, members of the armed forces, volunteers and charity workers. Charlotte Moore, the BBC’s chief content officer, said: “We are thrilled to be bringing the nation together for this incredible, once-in-a-lifetime event, broadcast live across the BBC with an amazing star-studded lineup of performers to celebrate the Queen’s momentous 70 years on the throne.” Further details and additional artists will be confirmed closer to the event.",Arts/Music,Brian May and Sam Ryder join platinum jubilee party headliners,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/18/brian-may-and-sam-ryder-join-platinum-jubilee-party-headliners
5/19/2022,"The wild ride on the US stock markets continued on Wednesday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking more than 1,100 points as investors worried about a looming recession. All of the major US markets fell sharply, with the S&P closing down 4%, its largest fall since June 2020, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq losing 4.7%. On Tuesday markets had rallied following positive news about consumer spending and signs that China was relaxing its strict Covid-19 lockdowns. Just a day later concerns about an economic slowdown triggered a wide-ranging sell-off. The sell-off began after Target said supply chain costs and inflationary pressures had cut into its profits and customers were buying fewer higher-margin items such as kitchen appliances, televisions and furniture. The retailer’s announcement came a day after Walmart said its profit had also been hit by higher costs. The latest news from Target led to a sell-off for retailers including Amazon, BestBuy, Costco and Dollar General. Investors are increasingly concerned that rising inflation, and the Federal Reserve’s plans to tackle it by sharply hiking interest rates, will trigger a recession. Target’s management expects inflation to add $1bn to its fuel and freight costs this year and sees little sign of those costs easing throughout 2022. Gas prices topped $4 a gallon in every state this week for the first time. “Throughout the quarter, we faced unexpectedly high costs, driven by a number of factors, resulting in profitability that came in well below our expectations, and well below where we expect to operate over time,” said Target’s chief executive, Brian Cornell. The sell-off was broad-based. Tech companies including Apple, Meta and Tesla fell sharply, as did the makers of household goods and grocery stores including Kroger and Procter & Gamble. General Motors and American Airlines fell along with banks including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. Stocks have been struggling to pull out of a slump over the last six weeks as concerns pile up for investors. Trading has been choppy on a daily basis and any data on retailers and consumers is being closely monitored by investors as they try to determine the impact from inflation and whether it will prompt a slowdown in spending. A bigger than expected hit to spending could signal more sluggish economic growth ahead. The Fed is trying to temper the impact from the highest inflation in four decades by raising interest rates. On Tuesday, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, told a Wall Street Journal conference that the US central bank will “have to consider moving more aggressively” if inflation fails to ease after earlier rate hikes. Investors are also concerned about global growth as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine puts even more pressure on prices for oil and food while lockdowns in China to stem Covid-19 cases worsens supply chain problems. The United Nations is significantly lowering its forecast for global economic growth this year from 4% to 3.1%. The downgrade is broad-based, which includes the world’s largest economies such as the US, China and the EU.

5/19/2022,"Martin Shkreli, the “Pharma Bro” entrepreneur who astronomically increased the price of a life-saving drug by 5,000%, and became a symbol of corporate Wall Street greed, has been released from prison. In a statement released on Wednesday, the Federal Bureau of Prisons said he had been released to a halfway house. “We can confirm Martin Shkreli transferred on May 18, 2022, from the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Allenwood Low to community confinement overseen by the Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) New York Residential Reentry Management (RRM) Office,” the statement said. Shkreli’s lawyer Benjamin Brafman confirmed his release, saying: “I am pleased to report that Martin Shkreli has been released from Allenwood prison and transferred to a BOP halfway house after completing all programs that allowed for his prison sentence to be shortened.” Shkreli is expected to be released from community confinement on 14 September 2022. He was originally due to be released from prison in September 2023. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Shkreli posted a selfie of him in a car wearing a grey sweater and black glasses with the caption: “Getting out of real prison is easier than getting out of Twitter prison.” Earlier this year, the 39-year old was barred for life from the pharmaceutical industry and fined $64.6m by a US court after the Federal Trade Commission and seven states brought a case against him. Shkreli had previously been the chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, a company that hiked the price of Daraprim, a life-saving drug used to treat Aids, malaria and cancer by over 5,000% in 2015. After his company acquired the Daraprim, it raised the price from $13.50 a tablet to $750 a tablet, prompting national outcry. In 2018, Shkreli was sentenced to seven years in prison after being found guilty of two counts of securities fraud and one count of securities fraud conspiracy. In addition to being banned for life from serving in any capacity in the pharmaceutical industry, Shkreli has also been permanently barred from running a public company.",News/US news,‘Pharma Bro’ Martin Shkreli released from prison early,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/martin-shkreli-release-prison-early
