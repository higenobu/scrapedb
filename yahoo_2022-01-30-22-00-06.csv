1/30/2022,"At a rally in Texas, Trump called for nationwide protests if prosecutors investigating him ""do anything illegal."" Trump faces various investigations into his actions as president and his financial affairs. He sought to link the investigations to his baseless claim that the 2020 election was rigged. Speaking at a Texas rally, former President Donald Trump called for nationwide protests if prosecutors investigating him and his businesses ""do anything illegal."" In the speech, he appeared to link the investigations to his baseless claim that the 2020 election was rigged, which led to the January 6 Capitol riot. ""If these radical, vicious, racist prosecutors do anything wrong or illegal, I hope we are going to have in this country the biggest protest we have ever had in Washington DC, in New York, in Atlanta and elsewhere because our country and our elections are corrupt,"" Trump told the crowd in Conroe, Texas on Saturday night. Since leaving office, Trump has faced a flurry of investigations into his actions as president and his private businesses. ""In reality, they're not after me, they're after you, and I just happen to be the person in the way,"" Trump told his supporters at the rally. The House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection is probing Trump's actions on that day and is considering whether Trump or his allies committed any crimes. The Trump Organization's financial dealings are also the subject of years-long investigations from the New York attorney general and the Manhattan district attorney's office. According to New York Attorney General Letitia James, her office has so far uncovered ""significant evidence"" that the Trump Organization used fraudulent and misleading asset valuations on multiple properties. ""For years, they've been going after my company, many years, using every trick in the book in an attempt to literally, if they can, put me in jail. They want to put me in jail,"" Trump said at the rally on Saturday. —Acyn (@Acyn) January 30, 2022 The former president repeatedly called the prosecutors ""racist,"" said they were ""mentally sick,"" and accused them of ""prosecutorial misconduct at the highest level."" ""They're going after me without any protection of my rights by the Supreme Court or most other courts,"" Trump said. —Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) January 30, 2022 On several occasions, Trump has appealed to the US Supreme Court to try and prevent investigators from obtaining documents and records relating to their probes. This month, the Supreme Court denied his request to block the January 6 committee from obtaining presidential records, which he tried to withhold by citing executive privilege. Last year, the Supreme Court also rejected a challenge from Trump to keep his tax returns secret.

1/30/2022,"19-year-old Jack Sweeney runs a Twitter account that tracks Elon Musk's private jet. Musk offered Sweeney $5,000 to remove it and give advice on how to make his jet less trackable. Sweeney told Insider he thought $5,000 was too low for the satisfaction he gets from the work. A 19-year-old who was offered $5,000 by Elon Musk to shut down a Twitter account tracking the billionaire's jet told Insider he refused the offer because it wasn't enough to replace the satisfaction he gets from running the account. Protocol was the first to report that Jack Sweeney had been approached by Musk via private messages on Twitter. The DMs, a screenshot of which Sweeney shared with Insider, showed Musk asked him to take down the Elon Musk's Jet Twitter account, saying it was a ""security risk."" Musk tweeted earlier this month, saying that social-media accounts discussing his whereabouts were ""becoming a security issue."" In the Twitter conversation viewed by Insider, Sweeney discussed with Musk how his bots are able to track the jet, and gave technical advice on how the billionaire could potentially make his jet less trackable. ""How about $5k for this account and generally helping make it harder for crazy people to track me?"" Musk asked. Sweeney responded: ""Sounds doable, account and all my help. Any chance to up that to $50K?"" The 19-year-old cited college funding and told the billionaire the money could go towards buying a Tesla Model 3. ""I've done a lot of work on this and 5k is not enough,"" Sweeney said in an interview with Insider. He added $5,000 wasn't enough to replace ""the fun I have in this, working on it."" In the messages viewed by Insider, Musk said he would think about Sweeney's counter-offer, then later said ""doesn't feel right to pay to shut this down."" Musk did not respond when contacted for comment by Insider. Sweeney told Insider Musk appears to have implemented some of his technical advice, using a blocking system that changes his jet's identifier making it harder to track. ""I just have to work around it,"" Sweeney said. Sweeney told Insider he had decided to go public with Musk's offer because the billionaire had lost interest in a deal. ""He went the opposite way of me, so why wouldn't I go the opposite way of him?"" he said. Sweeney started the Elon Musk's Jet Twitter account in June 2020. The account uses bots to scrape publicly available air traffic data, alerting followers to the movements of Musk's private jet. He said he had been working on the technology behind the account a few months before he launched it as a lockdown project. Sweeney said he had the idea because he was a fan of Musk's. ""I knew he had the jet, and I just knew it would reveal what business is going on and where he is going and stuff,"" he said. Sweeney said his father works aviation, sparking an interest in planes. ""I had the apps where you can track planes and stuff,"" Sweeney said, adding ""I kind of thought they were cool."" While at college, Sweeney said he has a part-time job working for a company called UberJets, where he builds a platform to help track chartered flights so the company can find clients cheaper seats. He added that his work on the Elon Musk's Jet Twitter account is on his GitHub, meaning he can showcase it to employers.

1/30/2022,"I’m not sure how I would have reacted had Myrtle Beach police done to me what Ronald Thomas Uhrie alleges they did to him. If events unfolded as he claims in a lawsuit, it’s the kind of entrapment that isn’t only bad for Uhrie but bad news for anyone thinking about helping a stranger on the street, especially if that stranger happens to be a woman. I know because I once picked up a prostitute near 17th Avenue South. Uhrie didn’t pick up anyone or even try to, according to his lawsuit against the city. After leaving a gas station parking lot, he noticed a woman “wave frantically” his way. He stopped, asked the woman if she needed anything. She offered to perform a sex act in exchange for $20. Though Uhrie did not know the woman was an undercover officer, he rolled up his window and drove off. A mile down the road, he was pulled over and arrested for soliciting prostitution and possessing a small amount of marijuana. He was released on bond the next day. Because of long-standing policy, Myrtle Beach officials declined comment and wouldn’t confirm if things played out as Uhrie claims. The lawsuit noted that the charges were later dismissed, and claims the cop lied and Uhrie lost his job because of the arrest. As described, it appears to be entrapment, police creating a crime that without their intervention would not have been committed. If true, those facts should mean a settlement or verdict in Uhrie’s favor. He’s asking for legal fees, lost wages and other damages. That would be good for him, but bad for the city and every resident and visitor who is prone to helping strangers or need assistance in a moment of distress. It would make good Samaritans think twice before stopping to help a suffering stranger. If you can be arrested and have your life upended for the sin of rolling down your window to respond to a woman waving frantically, the risk of stopping becomes too great. It would have made me think twice all those years ago when I picked up that prostitute. I didn’t know she was a prostitute when I pulled over. All I saw was a woman with dirty-grass-stained knees holding her bra while stumbling on the side of the road. I asked if she needed help. She stumbled into my car. She was frantic. I accidentally butt dialed my wife, who heard the entire exchange between me and the woman without my knowing it. I got the woman over to the rape crisis center where I found out her background. Before we could do anything to help, maybe provide medical assistance, she walked away. Though I never saw her again, I’ve never forgotten her in part because I’m not sure my stopping did any good, and in part because I know things could have gone much differently. Had that woman been an undercover officer, I could have ended up where Uhrie’s lawsuit claims he is. It gives me pause. I have responsibilities to my wife of 23 years, my two kids, colleagues and so many others. Should I risk that to help a stranger? It’s a question that has long tickled my brain. With crime generating headlines during a hyper-partisan time such as this, the police are being asked to do more to curb any excesses, to ensure the quality of life in the city remains high. No matter what you think of prostitution as a moral matter, you would consider it a nuisance if it became an open problem in your neighborhood, and you’d want something done about it. But there has to be a better way to fight crime without unnecessarily creating more criminals.

1/30/2022,"Highschool sweethearts Rodney McCoy and Carla Walker had just left a high school Valentine’s dance on Feb. 17, 1974 when a stranger opened their car door, slammed McCoy with the butt of a gun and dragged Walker off into the night. The popular high school cheerleader would never be seen alive again — and it would take more than four decades to bring her killer to justice. McCoy recalled the final horrific moments he spent with his girlfriend in a new interview with NBC’s “Dateline,” airing Friday at 9 p.m. ET/8 p.m. CT. “We started making out and doing what teenagers do,” McCoy said of their last few minutes together in the parking lot of a local Fort Worth bowling alley where they'd stopped to use a bathroom after the dance. “When he opened the door, he nailed me pretty good with the butt of the pistol. She said, ‘Stop hitting him, I’ll go with you.’” As McCoy was about to lose consciousness, he recalled his girlfriend’s final words to him. “She screams ‘Rodney, go get my dad’ and that’s the last words I heard her say,” McCoy said. Her body was found three days later in a ditch. She had been strangled to death and sexually assaulted, according to Oxygen’s “The DNA of Murder with Paul Holes,” which featured the case in 2020. Authorities also found traces of morphine in the 17-year-old’s system. For 46 years, her death would remain a mystery until investigators announced the arrest of Glen Samuel McCurley in 2020, according to NBC Dallas-affiliate KXAS-TV. Investigators were able to link McCurley — who was 77 years old at the time of his arrest — to the murder through DNA recovered from stains on Walker’s clothing. McCurley had been interviewed by Fort Worth detectives back in 1974 because he had owned a .22 Ruger, which matched a magazine found at the scene of the crime, but he was never pursued as a suspect. McCurley proclaim his innocence after his arrest in 2020, but dramatically switched his plea to guilty last year in the middle of his trial. He told police that, the night he killed Walker, he had been out drinking when he noticed the couple in the parking lot of the bowling alley. Although McCurley initially said he had seen the couple fighting and only intervened to “help her out,” he later admitted to abducting, torturing and killing her.  Walker’s older sister, Cindy Stone, described her sister to “The DNA of Murder with Paul Holes” as a “little spitfire” and said she had a “great relationship” with McCoy, who was the starting quarterback for the high school football team at the time. Although McCoy was injured during Walker's abduction, some people had questioned his account of what happened that night for decades until McCurley’s arrest finally affirmed the young man's story. “It’s been 47 years,” McCoy told local station KXAS-TV after McCurley pleaded guilty. “I had a cloud of suspicion on me for all those years. That’s torment.”  Even though he was not responsible for what happened to his girlfriend, McCoy said he still feels guilty that he wasn’t able to save her. “I just felt I let Mr. Walker down,” he told KXAS-TV last year of his girlfriend's father. “His ‘little flower.’ ‘Take care of my little flower.’”  To learn more about the case, tune in to “Dateline” on Friday at 9 p.m. ET/ 8 p.m. CT.",U.S./Oxygen,Man Recounts Girlfriend's Words As She Was Abducted After A 1974 Valentine's Dance,https://news.yahoo.com/man-recounts-girlfriends-words-she-220248000.html
