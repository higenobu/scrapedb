3/7/2022,"People who have a rosy outlook on the world may live healthier, longer lives because they have fewer stressful events to cope with, new research suggests. Scientists found that while optimists reacted to, and recovered from, stressful situations in much the same way as pessimists, the optimists fared better emotionally because they had fewer stressful events in their daily lives. How optimists minimise their dose of stress is unclear, but the researchers believe they either avoid arguments, lost keys, traffic jams and other irritations, or simply fail to perceive them as stressful in the first place. Previous studies have found evidence that optimists live longer and healthier lives, but researchers do not fully understand why having a glass-half-full attitude might contribute to healthy ageing. “Given prior work linking optimism to longevity, healthy ageing, and lower risks of major diseases, it seemed like a logical next step to study whether optimism might protect against the effects of stress among older adults,” said Dr Lewina Lee, a clinical psychologist at the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System and assistant professor of psychiatry at Boston University. Lee and her colleagues analysed information provided by 233 men who were at least 21 years old when they enrolled in the US Veterans Affairs Normative Ageing Study between 1961 and 1970. Surveys in the 1980s and 90s assessed the men’s levels of optimism. Between 2002 and 2010, they completed up to three eight-day-long diary entries that recorded their mood and any stressful situations they encountered. The researchers suspected that the optimists might bounce back more swiftly than pessimists, and return to a good mood faster following a stressful event. But the data did not bear this out. “We found that more optimistic men reported having fewer daily stressors, which partially explained their lower levels of negative mood,” Lee said. “That suggested to us that perhaps more optimistic men either limited their exposure to stressful situations, or that they were less likely to perceive or label situations as stressful.” Although the study published in the Journals of Gerontology focused on older men, Lee said she expected the findings to hold for older women too. “Less is known about age differences in the role of optimism in health,” she added. Levels of optimism or pessimism tend to be fairly stable across people’s lives, but Lee believes there are ways to foster a more rosy outlook for those who want to. “One way to become more optimistic is to develop an awareness of how we internally react to or judge a situation,” she said. “Oftentimes our automatic reaction involves a negative evaluation, or a worst-case scenario. It will be useful to catch ourselves doing that, and then try to come up with different ways of approaching the situation. “A more optimistic thought does not mean being Pollyanna-ish or ignoring risks, which is a common misconception about optimism. It may involve acknowledging our strengths, past examples of success, and areas over which we have control, so that we can arrive at a more positive and confident outlook,” she added. Prof Andrew Steptoe, head of behavioural science and health at UCL, who was not involved in the study, said optimists may genuinely lead more hassle-free existences than pessimists. They may be easier to get on with than pessimists and so run into conflict less often, for example. Or they may simply be less likely to view daily incidents as stresses. “If you have an optimistic disposition, it seems quite plausible that you won’t regard relatively trivial occurrences in your life as stressful,” he said. What the findings mean for wellbeing is difficult to say though, he added. “There is evidence that greater optimism and less pessimism is linked with reduced risk of future ill-health. “This could be related to lifestyle - greater physical activity, better diet, less smoking – though optimism also has biological correlates, such as lower systemic inflammation, that may be health protective.”",News/Science,"Reasons to be cheerful: optimists live longer, says study",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/07/reasons-to-be-cheerful-optimists-live-longer-says-study
3/7/2022,"As war kicked off in Ukraine, soldiers at a military airstrip in the west of the country went hunting for the origin of a laser pointer they feared was marking out targets on their base. They found it in a nearby church. Behind the thick walls of the building in Kolomyia, run by monks loyal to Moscow, they also discovered a large stockpile of food and alcohol, and three guns. “It’s very, very surprising, because it was a monastery,” said Father Mykhailo Arsenich, army chaplain to the unit that searched the church. “There was a big stockpile of food, packed for military use, designed to keep 60 to 65 people for a very long time.” “We found two pistols, and one hunting rifle which was converted from a combat Kalashnikov. They couldn’t address the question of why priests needed guns.” A bitter, long-running feud over religious allegiance has intensified since Russia invaded. The Ukrainian Orthodox church formally split from under Moscow’s leadership three years ago, but many historic churches and monasteries have remained loyal in religious practice and political allegiance to Russia. Those Moscow ties have put Ukrainian communities that surround them on edge with suspicion. To many residents, the thick walls and cave networks of ancient monasteries and churches suddenly look like potential military bases, or warehouses for a hostile invading force. Pochaiv, one of the holiest sites in western Ukraine, was built to honour a footprint of the Virgin Mary and a famous military victory four centuries ago. The sprawling complex of ancient churches, cave chapels and a historic bell tower, normally bustling with pilgrims, is almost empty. Some are staying away because they fear it could be targeted as a symbol of Moscow, some are staying away because they fear it could be used as a military base to launch attacks, and others simply want to distance themselves from the ties to Russia it represents. “I’m afraid there will be an attack,” said one woman who runs a hostel for pilgrims a few hundred metres from the site. Her normally busy dormitories are empty. The church is closed to visitors outside services for the first time that Sasha – a former altar boy now in his thirties – can remember. “It is because of the situation,” says the only monk willing to talk; others wave visitors away. Burly men wearing military boots follow a group of foreign visitors around, not bothering to disguise their surveillance. There is no evidence of Russian military links at any of the sites. But in the strongly nationalist west, allegiance to Moscow after a devastating invasion is cause for suspicion on its own. The firearms found at Kolomyia were registered, so not illegal, and nor was the stockpile of food. But the find inflamed local concerns that Russian troops might be planning to use the building, just 300 metres from the airfield, as an outpost if they march farther west. “We didn’t find the laser pointer, but found the place where we think it was used. A hole in the wall, facing the right way,” Arsenich said. “I don’t have any doubts, if Russian paratroopers land there, they will use the church as their base.” “I stopped going for confession ten years ago. I don’t like the way they are strongly involved in pro-Russian politics,” said Yuir, a Pochaiv businessman, 62, who said his deeply religious mother would have been heartbroken if she had lived to see suspicions between the church and community around it. Like many Ukrainians who no longer trust the Russian-linked churches in their country, Yuir is particularly wary of the Moscow Patriarch, Kirill, who according to material from Soviet archives was a government agent before the fall of the USSR. “Kirill is a KGB guy, and he supports all aggression against Ukraine,” he said, but asked not to give his last name, worried like many in the town about community tensions about the church. “He’s a bastard, not a religious leader.” In a sermon, Kirill said that Russian values were being tested by the west, which offered only excessive consumption and the illusion of freedom. Others resent a church they say shows no concern for its community, barring them from what is effectively an ancient air raid tunnel. They wonder what it is hidden in tunnels if townspeople that shelter in the shadow of the monastery can’t enter. “They have a lot of underground tunnels there, very good and protected ones. If there is shelling here, we don’t have any safe place, only the lavra. But the priests don’t suggest that you can come and sit there and be safe,” said Nadia, a housewife who lives beside the monument. Whether the violence of war reaches Pochaiv or not, though, many of those who grew up around it believe the Russian invasion will change its future. The horrors of this year make a religious split with Moscow inevitable, they say. “My dream is to make a story about the lavra, the history of the place, and role of modern history,” Sasha said. “To try to convince people we have to stop and change the leadership, because we cannot have Russian church here.”",News/World news,Ukraine’s pro-Russian monasteries draw local suspicion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/ukraines-pro-russian-monasteries-draw-local-suspicion
3/7/2022,"The women huddled in the centre of the pitch, to briefly strategise, to pray for Ukraine. Then the whistle blew, and to cries of “Forza, sisters!” from their fans, they prepared for kick-off. The youngest player is 27, the eldest 52, and they are among the 18 brought together from congregations across Italy to form the first national football team for nuns in the world. “I’ve always been passionate about football,” said Sister Livia Angelillis, who scored a goal during the match against Le Camille, a team of former Serie A women’s league players, in Milan. “Maybe I was born with a ball in my hands.” On more than one occasion, Pope Francis has told nuns not to become “old maids” and to get out more. The sisters took heed of the pontiff’s words, as did Moreno Buccianti, a former amateur footballer and founder of the national team for priests, who said Francis motivated him to fulfil his long-held ambition of establishing a side for nuns, too. The plan was given further impetus after the Vatican set up its first women’s football team, made up of lay workers within the Holy See, in 2019, and finally the Italy team was officially formed in June last year. The first game was blessed by Sister Paola D’Auria, the squad’s honorary president and a huge Lazio fan who became famous in Italy for her football commentary on TV. “We have a team for priests, so it was only right that there should be one for nuns,” said Buccianti. “The pope’s message was really important, and through football the nuns evangelise – the main aim is to attract young people back to the church.” The players are a mix of nationalities, including Romanian, Mexican and Malagasy, and most played football before becoming nuns. Sister Annika Fabbian, a striker, played for Vicenza’s female youth team. She also teaches art history, and whenever she can has a kick-around in the school’s courtyard with her students. “My mother wasn’t so happy when I dropped dance classes for football,” Annika, 32, said. “She used to tell me to leave all my gear outside as it was full of mud. But after a while she got used to it.” Sister Emilia Jitaru, 52, was somewhat of a football star in her home country of Romania, playing for a top league team and selected to join the women’s national team. But she abandoned the football career, and her fiance, after receiving the “sudden calling” to become a nun. “Joining the nunhood came via football,” she said. “In 1992 I was preparing to play in a match and a priest said, ‘Come to mass, it will bring you a lot of fortune.’ I told him I don’t believe in God. The next day, a voice inside me told me to go to the mass, and when I met the sisters and did the sign of peace with one, something changed – I had never felt such joy before, not even when I scored a goal.” When Buccianti first started talking about forming a team for nuns, some laughed the venture off. “At the same time there was a curiosity to see nuns playing football, and for the most part the team has been completely supported and appreciated,” he said. The women need permission from the mother superior of their congregation to participate, the majority of whom have granted it, although some of their fellow sisters have sneered. “Some still consider it to be a masculine sport that shouldn’t be played by women,” said Sister Annika. “Now after the success of the Italian national team in the 2019 Women’s World Cup, the mentality has changed a bit. But who cares about the critics? We’re doing this for young people.” The nuns make time for training and playing football wherever they can in their busy schedule. They have played four matches since the team was formed, winning a debut fundraiser in November to mark the UN’s International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. They lost 4-1 to Le Camille , but viewed the friendly more as a way to prepare for their next match in Assisi in May against their main rival – the Vatican. “It is a big commitment,” said Sister Livia, who is a big fan of Inter Milan. “But we are fortunate in that we can unite our passion for football while evangelising.” Buccianti has had requests from other nuns keen to join the squad, and hopes to inspire the formation of national sides’ for nuns beyond Italy. The sisters say the best thing about the team is that it brings them all together, to collaborate and support each other while having fun. “Playing with a ball is easy, but creating a team is a lot of hard work, but we managed it,” said Sister Emilia.",Sport/Football,Kicking the habit: footballing nuns’ goal is to pass on word of God,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/07/no-novices-footballing-nuns-italy-kick-habit
