2/19/2022,"People in Briton and Ireland hunkered down on Friday (February 18) as Storm Eunice toppled roofs and trees and buffeted planes coming in to land at Heathrow. The Atlantic storm posed a threat to life, Britain's Meteorological Office said, with record winds. A gust of 122 miles per hour recorded on the Isle of Wight is provisionally the most powerful ever recorded in England. Storm Eunice knocked out power for more than 100,000 people and shredded the roof of London's O2 performance arena. It brewed in the central Atlantic and was spun up from the Azores towards Europe by the jet stream, before making landfall in Cornwall, where waves lashed the coast, sending plumes of spray over the roofs of cottages. A man died in Ireland after being struck by a falling tree while clearing storm debris, RTE reported. Planes were buffeted so strongly by gusts at some airports that pilots were forced to abandon landings. This live stream of Heathrow Airport's runway was being watched by more than 200,000 people online. Ferries and trains were also cancelled, and Britain's security minister said troops were on standby.",Science/Reuters Videos,"Deadly Storm Eunice batters Britain, Ireland",https://news.yahoo.com/deadly-storm-eunice-batters-britain-161725979.html
2/19/2022,"By Nancy Lapid (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review. Antibodies improve for months after mRNA vaccine Antibodies induced by mRNA COVID-19 vaccines keep improving in quality for at least six months while the immune system continues to ""train"" its antibody-producing B cells, according to a new study. After vaccination, some B cells become short-lived antibody-producing cells, while others join ""germinal centers"" in lymph nodes - essentially, a training camp where they mature and perfect their skills. ""Cells that successfully graduate (from germinal centers) can become long-lived antibody-producing cells that live in our bone marrow or 'memory B cells' that are ready to engage if the person gets infected,"" explained Ali Ellebedy of Washington University in St. Louis. Animal studies have suggested that so-called germinal center reactions last only weeks. But analyses of blood, lymph node tissue and bone marrow from volunteers who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine showed germinal center reactions induced by the shots lasted at least six months, with antibodies becoming increasingly better at recognizing and attacking the spike protein of the original version of SARS-CoV-2, Ellebedy's team reported on Tuesday in Nature https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04527-1. They did not test the mature antibodies' ability to neutralize variants, but in theory, Ellebedy said, the antibodies should be better able to recognize parts of the spike common to the variants and the original strain. More research is needed to know whether this robust germinal center response is unique to mRNA vaccines or if it is also induced by more traditional vaccines. Red blood cells damaged by COVID cause blood-vessel problems Dysfunctional red blood cells contribute to the blood vessel injuries common in severe COVID-19, according to laboratory studies that also may suggest a way to treat the problem. Many patients hospitalized for COVID-19 are thought to have damage to the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels, which can lead to blood clots, organ impairment, and other complications. New findings from the blood of 17 moderately ill COVID-19 patients and 27 healthy volunteers confirm ""profound and persistent endothelial dysfunction"" as an effect of the coronavirus, researchers reported on Wednesday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology https://www.jacc.org/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jacbts.2021.12.003. Compared to the red blood cells in healthy people, those from COVID-19 patients release fewer beneficial nitric oxide molecules and more detrimental inflammation-causing molecules, said Dr. Ali Mahdi of Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm. In combination with elevated levels of a certain enzyme, the inflammatory molecules injure the blood-vessel lining, his team found. As a result, the vessel cannot relax properly. The dysfunction is reversed by drugs that restore normal enzyme levels and limit production of the harmful molecules, Mahdi said. Whether test-tube findings can be replicated in people is not yet clear. The experiment was performed on the original coronavirus, so it is also unclear whether red blood cells are similarly affected in infections caused by variants of SARS-CoV-2. Global project helps low-income countries reuse N95 masks An international group of physicists, engineers and physicians has designed a cheap, easy-to-construct cabinet with ultraviolet-C (UV-C) bulbs that has allowed health clinics in lower-income countries to decontaminate and reuse over 900,000 protective N95 masks. The prototype was constructed using a metal office storage cabinet lined with household aluminum foil, with UV-C bulbs at the front and back, consortium members reported on Wednesday in NEJM Catalyst https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.21.0439. ""You simply load the masks on a rack, put them in the cabinet, shut the doors and turn the device on to apply the right dose of UV-C to inactivate the COVID-19 virus,"" said Dr. Nicole Starr, a surgery trainee at the University of California, San Francisco who led the effort. The process takes about 10 minutes. Once the group had a workable design, they recruited members of local student chapters of the optics society Optica to build the cabinets, sometimes working with embassies to arrange for shipments of the necessary components. Engineering teams in nine countries and hospitals in 12 countries worked on the project. ""Overall, 21 cabinets were put into use in hospitals, and we estimate that 930,000 N95s were decontaminated for reuse from July 2020 to January 2022,"" Starr said. Decontamination equipment currently used in U.S. hospitals can cost $80,000 per unit, according to the report. The team estimated that their cabinet can be built for about $500 to $1,500 depending on location and can process nearly 5,000 masks per day at maximum capacity.

2/19/2022,"More than 100 vehicles were involved in a massive pileup on Interstate 39 in snowy Illinois on Thursday, Feb. 17, and the roadway remains closed a day later, officials say. The pileup happened in El Paso, eventually shutting down a 17-mile stretch of the interstate from Normal to Minonk, Illinois State Police said. Officials earlier in the day warned of “high rates of snowfall and blizzard-like conditions” that would cause poor driving conditions throughout Illinois. El Paso is about 125 miles southwest of Chicago. The first collision was reported around 3:15 p.m. Thursday, eventually causing 28 vehicles to be damaged and dozens of others to run off the roadway, WGLT reported. The City of El Paso said there were “a few minor injuries” and people were being sheltered in the town’s library and city municipal building. The city’s school district provided a school bus to transport people away from the pileup, the El Paso Emergency Squad said. As of 5 a.m. Friday, the interstate remained closed in both directions and it was not expected to reopen until midday, according to the Illinois Department of Transportation. Images and video show dozens of semis involved in the massive pileup. Warning: Some videos below contain graphic language. J.W. Price, the mayor of El Paso, said Friday he has “never been more proud of our community” as he was Thursday. “Everyone in our community played a role, and after an incident of this magnitude, it only solidifies why El Paso is such a wonderful community to call home,” Price said as he thanked first responders and citizens who stepped up to help. ‘People are going to die.’ Snow, ice strand hundreds of drivers on I-95 in Virginia Hurricane Ida evacuee dies in fiery 9-car pileup heading home to Louisiana, police say",U.S./Belleville News-Democrat,"100-vehicle pileup leads to chaotic scene in snowy Illinois, photos and videos show",https://news.yahoo.com/100-vehicle-pileup-leads-chaotic-141027109.html
2/19/2022,"McALESTER, Okla. (AP) — Oklahoma executed a man Thursday for his role in a quadruple slaying in 2005. Gilbert Ray Postelle, 35, received a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, and prison officials declared him dead at 10:14 a.m. It was Oklahoma’s fourth execution since October, when the state resumed lethal injections following a nearly seven-year hiatus. Postelle, who was lying on a gurney with his arms outstretched beside him, declined to give any last words and glanced a few times at the seven witnesses who were in the viewing room next to the execution chamber as the execution began. A doctor entered the chamber and declared Postelle unconscious at 10:06 a.m. after rubbing his sternum, shaking him and appearing to speak to him. “Today did not put closure on anything,"" said Shelli Milner, the sister of Donnie Swindle, one of the four people Postelle was convicted of killing. “His family grieves as our families have grieved for 17 years. To know that he will never walk this earth again does give me a little more peace than I had yesterday."" During a clemency hearing in December, Postelle did not deny his involvement in the Memorial Day 2005 shooting deaths of James Alderson, Terry Smith, Swindle and Amy Wright. But Postelle’s attorney, Robert Nance, argued that his client suffered from a learning disability, the abandonment of his mother at a young age and had begun abusing methamphetamine on a nearly daily basis beginning at age 12. “He’s a different man than he was,” Nance told the Pardon and Parole Board. “I think he needs a certain amount of forgiveness because he grew up in an environment that was almost exclusively negative.” Postelle himself also testified at the hearing via video link from the prison that he had been using meth for days before the killings and remembered little about the crimes. “I do understand that I’m guilty and I accept that,” he said. “There’s nothing more that I know to say to you all than I am truly sorry for what I’ve done to all these families.” Prosecutors say Postelle, his brother David Postelle, father Brad Postelle and another man carried out the killings in a “blitz attack” motivated by their belief that Swindle was responsible for a motorcycle accident that left Brad Postelle seriously injured. But prosecutors said there was no evidence that Swindle was involved in the crash. Gilbert Postelle received two death sentences for the killings of Wright and Alderson after evidence showed he pursued the two as they were trying to flee and shot them from behind with a rifle. “In her final moments, Amy Wright was screaming and clawing the ground to escape from Gilbert Postelle,” Assistant Attorney General Julie Pittman told the board. The board also heard powerful testimony from one of the victim's mothers, Mary Joe Swindle, who said she never got to see her son's body because it was so riddled with bullets. The panel ultimately voted 4-1 to deny clemency for Postelle. Oklahoma once had one of the busiest death chambers in the country, but all executions were put on hold in 2015 after a botched lethal injection in 2014 and drug mix-ups that led to one inmate being executed with the wrong drug. Another inmate was just moments away from being led to the death chamber before prison officials realized the same wrong drug had been delivered for his execution. In 2020, Oklahoma's then-Attorney General Mike Hunter said the state had secured a source of drugs, fine-tuned its lethal injection protocols and was prepared to resume executions using a three-drug combination that includes the sedative midazoloam, vecuronium bromide, a paralytic, and potassium chloride, which stops the heart.",U.S./Associated Press,Oklahoma executes man for role in 2005 quadruple slaying,https://news.yahoo.com/oklahoma-set-execute-man-role-043808349.html
