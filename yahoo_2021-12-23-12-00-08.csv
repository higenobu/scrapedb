12/23/2021,"By Reuters Staff PARIS (Reuters) - France has cancelled its order for Merck & Co's COVID-19 antiviral drug following disappointing trial data and hopes instead to receive Pfizer's competing drug before the end of January, the health minister said on Wednesday. France is the first country to publicly say it has cancelled an order for the Merck treatment after the company released data in late November suggesting its drug was markedly less effective than previously thought, reducing hospitalisations and deaths in its clinical trial of high-risk individuals by about 30%. ""The latest studies weren't good,"" Olivier Veran told BFM TV. Merck did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. While vaccines are the main weapons against COVID-19 for governments, there are hopes Merck and Pfizer's experimental pills could be a game-changer in reducing the chances of dying or hospitalisation for those most at risk of severe illness. France had placed an early order for 50,000 doses of the nucleoside analogue drug molnupiravir developed by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. The cancellation would not incur a cost, Veran said. In Italy, the office of the special commissioner for the COVID emergency said on Nov 18 it had received a mandate from the health ministry to buy 50,000 courses of Merck's pill and another 50,000 of Pfizer's. ""The contract has not yet been finalised, but is in progress,"" a spokesperson for the commissioner told Reuters on Tuesday. Italian drug regulator Aifa's head Nicola Magrini told a Senate committee on Dec. 9 the two treatments could be available in Italy from the end of January. However, regardless of the availability of the drugs, there will be assessments of their use, two top government scientific advisers told Reuters. ""There must and will be an evaluation, independently of the assessments of regulatory bodies,"" Walter Ricciardi, top adviser of health minister Roberto Speranza, told Reuters. Germany has already bought Merck's antiviral treatment, health minister Karl Lauterbach told Reuters on Wednesday. ""This is a binding order,"" he said, adding Berlin was also in talks with Pfizer about buying its antiviral drug. The European Medicines Agency is expected to decide whether to approve the Merck and Pfizer pills in the new year. Pfizer's Paxlovid, a protease inhibitor, has shown near 90% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths in high-risk patients. France had purchased that drug instead, Veran said, without saying how many doses it had secured. ""France is lined up to get it before the end of January,"" Veran continued. It has not yet been decided whether the drug would be available over the counter in pharmacies, the minister said.",World/Reuters,France cancels order for Merck's COVID-19 antiviral drug,https://news.yahoo.com/france-cancels-order-mercks-covid-125445398.html
12/23/2021,"Sen. Manchin hit out at Democrats' attempts to get him to back Joe Biden's Build Back Better bill. ""I won't continue to go down everything you want to do,"" said Manchin in a local news interview Monday. He said to get his backing a bill would have to be vetted by Senate committees. Sen. Joe Manchin said that Democrats had tried to ""badger and beat"" him into voting for President Joe Biden's sweeping social care and climate change bill, and that he'd only reconsider his opposition if the legislation was totally rewritten. Manchin, a West Virginia Democratic moderate, made the comment in an interview with West Virginia MetroNews Monday in the wake of his decision to not back Biden's $1.6 trillion Build Back Better bill, the centrepiece of the president's domestic policy agenda. The bill requires the unanimous support of Democratic senators to pass, and despite months of negotiations and increasingly urgent appeals from the Biden White House and his own party, Manchin pulled the plug on the bill in a Fox News interview on Sunday. â€”MetroNews (@WVMetroNews) December 20, 2021 In the interview with West Virginia MetroNews Monday, Manchin struck a note of defiance. ""I knew what they could and could not do. They just never realized it, because they figure surely to God we can move one person. Surely, we can badger and beat one person up,"" Manchin said. ""Well, guess what? I'm from West Virginia. I'm not from where they're from, [where] they can just beat the living crap out of people and think they'll be submissive."" Manchin said that the only circumstances he could see himself backing the bill were if it were rewritten, and instead focused on revoking President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts. He said he wanted the bill to go through the Senate committees, a process that could take months. Manchin provided no clear assurance that even if the bill was rewritten that it would get his backing and be able to pass. ""I won't continue to go down everything you want to do, major policy changes and reconciliation. It needs to go through a process,"" Manchin said. The future of the Build Back Better bill is uncertain, with Democratic senators to meet on Tuesday to try and work out a way forward for the bill. One possibility that remains open is that Manchin could still accept a revised, pared down version of the bill, say observers. Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said that a vote on the bill will go ahead in the new year. But Manchin said Monday he'd welcome the chance to sink the bill in its current form in a Senate vote. ""Please put it on the floor. Maybe it will sink in that we have to look in a different direction than this far-reaching social agenda,"" Manchin said.
