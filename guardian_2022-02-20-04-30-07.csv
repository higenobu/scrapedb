2/20/2022,"Raisa Malashenko was trundling her rusty bicycle, laden with bags of food, through the centre of Stanytsia Luhanska on Saturday afternoon. The 81-year-old did not flinch as booms of artillery sounded in the distance. Her five children have all left this frontline town, some for Russia and others for safer parts of Ukraine. “It’s just me and my cow now,” she said mournfully.  Like many older people in eastern Ukraine, Malashenko said she missed the Soviet period, and said she blamed the Ukrainian army and Kyiv’s western backers for the current escalation. But she also said she was terrified of a Russian invasion. “God forbid the Russians come, and then with them their Cossacks and Chechen fighters will come. Imagine what a hell it will be then,” she said, a tear glistening in one of her eyes. Over eight years of war, residents close to the frontlines here have become used to the idea that at any time their lives could be altered by a bullet or shell. They even refer to the booms as “badminton” – the sporadic exchanges of fire across the line of control. In the past week, however, the explosions have been more intense than any time in the past few years, and the targets have apparently been residential areas and even schools. There are approximately 2 million people living within 12 miles of the frontline, aid organisations estimate, and if the spark for escalation comes in east Ukraine, a new conflict would hit them first. Stanytsia Luhanska was formerly a suburb of the city of Luhansk, but since the war in 2014 has been cut off from the rest of the city by a frontline. On the other side is the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic – one of two Russia-backed proxy states where Moscow appears to be looking for a pretext to begin military action against Ukraine. There, authorities called for an evacuation to Russia on Friday – supposedly in advance of a Ukrainian attack but more likely as a pretext for Russia to launch a strike. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk region, said on Saturday plans had been drawn up for the evacuation of women and children on the Ukrainian side of the border too. “Maybe in the coming days we will order an evacuation, if there is an escalation. But if we do it too quickly it will cause panic,” he told the Observer. In one of many incidents that Ukrainian officials say shows a major escalation from Russia, the Fairy Tale kindergarten in Stanytsia Luhanska was hit by fire on Thursday, injuring two people. On Saturday, the Ukrainian military flew a group of journalists into the town to help dispel what it said was a false Russian narrative that the Ukrainian army has been behind the recent uptick in violence. Two ageing Mi-8 helicopters took off from an aerodrome in Kramatorsk and travelled east along the line of control for an hour. The juddering choppers flew low over the barren, brownish east Ukraine landscape, where an unseasonably warm February has melted all but a few isolated patches of winter snow. Inside the kindergarten, a pile of rubble was still scattered on the floor, incongruous alongside the cartoons and drawings plastering the walls. “It’s very important for everyone to understand that it’s the Russian Federation that’s behind this. We have no offensive plans … and Ukraine does not want a war,” said Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereschuk, who addressed journalists from inside the kindergarten on Thursday. Nobody is more fearful of a new war than the locals here, who despite their outward stoicism have suffered terribly during the past years. “Everyone who lives in the zone near the front has problems with their nerves and almost everyone has serious health problems,” said Larisa Grytsenko, who runs a humanitarian relief centre in the town of Zolote, close to the frontline. On Friday, her employees were helping 72-year-old Valentyna Melnychenko, whose home in the town of Vrubivka was hit on Thursday morning, destroying her kitchen annexe. Melnychenko wept as she surveyed the damage. Her pension, she said, was 2,800 hrivnya (£73). She was terrified of renewed hostilities, she said, but had no choice but to stay in her home, where she has lived since 1974 and which is now draughty and damp after the windows were blown out. “What am I supposed to do, where am I supposed to go?” she asked, wiping away tears. “I’ve lost my husband and my son in the past four years. I have nobody, I’m all alone.”",News/World news,‘God forbid the Cossacks come’: fears of war rise in Ukraine’s frontline towns,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/god-forbid-the-cossacks-come-fears-of-war-rise-in-ukraines-frontline-towns
2/20/2022,"In a vibrant liberal democracy, contestability of ideas is the lifeblood of the parliamentary system. Since federation, such debates have been crucial to the effective formulation, adjustment and refinement of draft legislation affecting the nation. The sometimes bruising exchange of such ideas has been described in gladiatorial terms – winner takes all. For the most part, however, it has allowed for both sides of politics to modify their positions, taking into account proposed amendments drawn from suggestions coming from both sides of parliament.  The system is not perfect, but as Winston Churchill once asserted, “democracy is the worst form of government … apart from all the others”. For more than a century, major issues of national security have been debated in Australia’s parliament this way and, on occasion, issues have been highlighted with a rhetorical flourish for dramatic effect in an attempt to wedge the other side. Sometimes that has worked well, and at other times it has backfired spectacularly. History is replete with examples of wedge national security issues coming back to haunt those who tried to use them. Billy McMahon’s excoriation of Gough Whitlam for travelling to Mao’s China in mid-1971 is one example, when it soon became clear that the US government of Richard Nixon was close on his heels, visiting China for a rapprochement. McMahon never recovered politically from the humiliating exposure of being out of touch. For some time the national security arena has been gathering steam and heat. President Xi’s exercise of wolf warrior diplomacy and sharp power has seen Australia become increasingly wary and uneasy about Chinese initiatives at home and abroad. That unease resulted in the blockage of Chinese telco Huawei from establishing its 5G communications infrastructure in Australia. Sensing a wider political and security risk in the Pacific, the Australian government has worked to prevent Chinese telecommunications infrastructure being installed in places like Solomon Islands as well. That was exacerbated, in Chinese eyes, by calls for transparency over the origins of the virus first detected in Wuhan. China presented a list of 14 demands which, if agreed to, would have amounted to a humiliating backdown the likes of which no Australian politician could contemplate without compromising their electoral prospects. Along the way, ALP leader Anthony Albanese and his team have assiduously avoided giving the impression that they would take a softer line on China should they win office this year. They have even distanced themselves from prominent former Labor leaders Paul Keating and Bob Carr, who have taken a softer angle on China’s sharp power. When combined with poor polling results and suggestions Keating and Carr’s views may be a more accurate representation of closely held ALP views, the Coalition has taken to the offensive to convince the electorate that national security is most safely left in their hands. The government latched on to a piece written by Bruce Haigh, a staunch government critic seen as sympathetic to China, which was published in the Chinese Communist party’s tabloid the Global Times on Monday. The piece, headlined “Weak Australian leadership inhibits potential relationship reset with China” seems to have hit a raw nerve in the Coalition and perhaps pointed to a deeper fear – that by winning the election, the ALP may be able to reset relations with China by virtue of not being Morrison and his government, without necessarily making a substantial policy change. Fearing such an outcome, it appears, they have picked up the issue like a cudgel to wield against Albanese and the federal parliamentary opposition. In doing so, some caution is called for. The Coalition has sensed the ALP’s willingness to use the election as a policy inflection point. An ALP election victory could allow for a not-unreasonable policy reset. Such a reset conceivably could be used to try to re-establish more normal relations in a face-saving way that avoids demeaning backdowns by Australia over the 14 points, or by China over Xi’s gratuitous wolf warrior sanctions. Such a use of diplomacy could serve the interests of both sides. After all, China is still Australia’s largest trading partner and it still needs what we have. It is worth remembering: China doesn’t buy from Australia because it likes our liberal democratic model, it does so because it is the best deal it can find. We retain some leverage. The Coalition appears eager to avoid allowing the ALP to claim credit for that outcome and to make the ALP look weak on national security. This fight is being led, it seems, by defence minister Peter Dutton. Prime minister Scott Morrison, eager to burnish his own national security credentials, has been trying, it seems, to keep up with him. They should proceed with considerable caution as the rhetorical sword they wish to wield against the ALP is double-edged. It could harm them more, and most likely will cause some harm to our body politic. Already there is growing unease and distrust of government exaggeration and efforts to control: over vaccines, over lockdowns and over a range of related issues. Many are frustrated and some want to lash out. The director general of security, Mike Burgess, has called on both sides, in effect, to back off, declaring this does not help him and his staff in Asio to counter the surge in foreign intervention and cyber-attacks, let alone politically and religiously motivated extremism. Debate is healthy and important in a democracy. It should be encouraged, but within accepted and recognised bounds. Issues should be addressed through extant parliamentary and governmental mechanisms like the foreign investment review board, the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security and the joint parliamentary standing committee on foreign affairs, defence and trade. The stakes are higher than they have been in generations, with a spike in great power contestation generating uncertainty and insecurity and which overlaps with a spectrum of governance challenges (terrorism, organised and transnational crime) and looming environmental crises (including climate change and pandemics). Combined, these challenges demand a sensible, level-headed consideration of the national interest and the long-term interests of the nation. Short-term politicking should proceed while firmly keeping these concerns in mind.

2/20/2022,"At the end of two torrid days in the witness box, the questions came relentlessly, rapidly at Emma Roberts. Asked to recount the moments and months when her marriage to decorated war veteran Ben Roberts-Smith slowly eroded, and then, suddenly, fell apart, she remained composed.  She told the court calmly of her growing suspicions her husband was having an affair, of the secret phone that would occasionally buzz in their bedroom, of his absences, his burying of secret items in the backyard. And finally, she detailed the arrival on her doorstep of the woman her husband had promised did not exist. Roberts, however stoic, was a reluctant witness, appearing for the newspapers her ex-husband is suing for defamation under force of a subpoena. Roberts-Smith’s lawyer, Bruce McClintock SC, however, put it to Roberts time and time again during cross-examination that she had taken the stand in order to destroy her ex-husband and the reputation he had earned. It was put to her that her testimony about her ex-husband’s affair was untrue; that nothing was ever buried in her backyard, as her ex-husband has told the court; that she “was quite prepared to lie” to discredit the man sitting impassively in the far corner of the courtroom. Over and over it was asserted she was lying to harm Roberts-Smith. “I bet you’re here to inflict as much damage upon him as you can,” McClintock said. “No,” Roberts said. “I hope Ben survives this nightmare.” The defamation trial brought by Roberts-Smith resumed early this month after more than half a year in abeyance because of Covid travel restrictions and shutdowns. Roberts-Smith, the recipient of the Victoria Cross, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying and domestic violence. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies wrongdoing. These three weeks of the trial have been focused on the evidence of witnesses subpoenaed by the newspapers, seeking to back up the allegations made in a series of reports in 2018. These are the key elements since the hearing resumed this month. The court heard from an army medic, known to the court as Person 16, who served alongside Roberts-Smith during an operation in Fasil, in southern Uruzgan province, in November 2012. “Outside the wire” on their last operation before returning home to Australia, Person 16 testified he and another soldier trained their weapons on an approaching Toyota Hilux ute and waved it to a stop. Person 16 told the court he took into custody and handcuffed two of the four men inside the vehicle: an older man with a full beard and a younger man. “I made him out to be late teens … not a full beard, a bit chubby, and shaking in terror,” he said. “He appeared extremely nervous and trembling uncontrollably.” Neither man was armed, Person 16 testified, but components for an improvised explosive device were found inside the vehicle. He said both were handcuffed and taken to a nearby compound for tactical questioning. Person 16 handed both prisoners over to Roberts-Smith, he told the court, and did not see the two men again. Person 16 said that about 15 minutes after handing over the two men he heard Roberts-Smith say over the troops’ radio “two EKIA”. EKIA is a military initialism for “enemy killed in action”. In the days after the mission, Person 16 told the court he crossed paths with Roberts-Smith in their accommodation lines at the SAS’s Camp Russell within Australia’s Tarin Kot base. He said he asked Roberts-Smith: “What happened to that young fella who was shaking like a leaf?” Person 16 told the court Roberts-Smith replied: “I shot that cunt in the head. Person 15 told me not to kill anyone on the last job. So I pulled out my 9mm, shot the cunt in the side of the head, blew his brains out. It was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.” Giving his evidence-in-chief, Person 16 was shown pictures of a dead Afghan male who he identified as the teenager he had taken into custody. The body was photographed with an AK-47 variant beside it. Person 16 said the young man was not armed when he handcuffed him. Under cross-examination, Person 16 was challenged by Roberts-Smith’s lawyers that the later barrack-room conversation about the alleged murder was a fabrication, “something you have imagined”. “I am 100% certain beyond any doubt that that conversation took place,” Person 16 responded. “His reply shocked me to the core, and that’s why I remembered it.” Asked whether he could confidently identify the body in the photographs he’d been shown as the teenager he had taken into custody, Person 16 told the court: “The more I think about it, the more I’m confident this was the person that was in the Toyota Hilux.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app In his evidence to the court last year, Roberts-Smith was asked about the alleged killing of the Afghan teenager. He said the account was “baseless”, that he never said those words, and that the event could not have happened, because he never fired his pistol in combat while on deployment in Afghanistan. “I never had to engage with my pistol,” he told the court. In his previous testimony, Roberts-Smith also rejected assertions he ever engaged in the practice of using “throw-downs” – compromising equipment, such as a radio or weapon, carried by soldiers and placed on the bodies of victims as a post-facto justification for their killing. Roberts-Smith has consistently maintained all of his actions in Afghanistan abided by the Australian troops’ rules of engagement. Emma Roberts is the only witness the court has actually seen over these three weeks. The courtroom is closed to visitors, and vision of the hearing is sent out over a limited live stream because of national security concerns. Every other witness has been anonymised before the court, and not shown on camera. Roberts told the court she had suspected for months her husband was having an affair – which he denied – before she was confronted by her husband’s lover on the doorstep of her own home in April 2018. Roberts said the woman, referred to in court as Person 17, appeared at her home unannounced, and with a black eye. The newspapers allege it was caused by Roberts-Smith striking her. He denies that and has told the court she fell down the stairs, intoxicated, at a function at Parliament House. Person 17 will appear as a witness for the newspapers later this trial. In her testimony, Roberts said with news of the affair set to become public, Roberts-Smith told his wife that she would lose access to their children if she didn’t lie and claim they had been separated. “Ben had suggested that the only way we would survive that [was] if we said we were separated, that I was to lie,” Roberts said. “I didn’t want to lie. There were enough lies.” Roberts told the court: “He [Roberts-Smith] pointed to our children sitting in the lounge room, and he said ‘if you don’t lie you will lose them’.” Roberts told the court she was coerced into posing for a photograph to accompany a front-page story in the Australian newspaper the next day, saying the couple had been separated. She said the story was false. Roberts also told the court she had suspected her husband was secretly burying cash around their Sunshine Coast home as their relationship faltered, and ultimately broke down. She said she dug under a “very obvious” spot beneath a hose reel to find, not money, but a cache of six USBs secreted in a child’s lunchbox. Roberts told the court a friend downloaded the contents of the USBs, and that she told her friend: “I do not want to see what’s on them.” While the USBs are not, themselves, evidence in the defamation hearing, the court has previously heard they contained operational reports from SAS missions in Afghanistan, drone footage of military operations, classified images and hundreds of photos of SAS soldiers drinking in the Fat Ladies Arms, an unofficial bar at the Australian military base in Afghanistan. Under cross-examination, lawyers for Roberts-Smith asserted Roberts had fabricated her evidence about the USBs and that nothing was found buried in the family backyard. Roberts told the court she stood by her testimony. Lawyers put to Roberts she was motivated by malice, embittered by the end of her marriage to Roberts-Smith, citing acrimonious text messages written to friends during their breakup that described the former soldier as a “lying cheating cunt” and his career as the Titanic – that is, destined to sink. “You did come to loathe him didn’t you?,” Roberts was asked. “Not loathe him, no, but I was very angry.” Roberts was accused of “fabrication” of her evidence about her marriage and home life, saying her testimony was “an exercise in rank hypocrisy”. “No,” Roberts replied. Evidence this month has also focused on events at a compound called Whiskey 108 in the village of Kakarak, a known insurgent stronghold in Uruzgan province. The newspapers allege that during an SAS operation there in 2009, two men were discovered in a secret tunnel inside Whiskey 108, an elderly man and another man with a prosthetic leg. The court heard this week the men were captive, compliant and unarmed, but the newspapers have alleged Roberts-Smith ordered another soldier to execute the elderly man, before forcibly marching the disabled man outside the compound, throwing him to the ground and shooting him dead with his machine gun. The man’s prosthetic leg was later kept by another soldier and used as a drinking vessel at the Australian soldiers’ unofficial bar on base, the court has heard. In evidence for the newspapers this week, one soldier, Person 41, told the court Roberts-Smith and another soldier borrowed his suppressor, which he believes was then used in the execution of the elderly man. Person 41 also testified he later saw Roberts-Smith “frogmarch” the man with a prosthetic leg outside the compound, throw him to the ground and machine-gun him to death. Under cross-examination, Person 41 was questioned why he hadn’t reported what he’d seen to his commanders. “I just wanted to keep quiet about the whole thing,” he told the court. “I was a new trooper, on my very first trip with the SAS, I just wanted to toe the line. It’s the unwritten rule – you go along with whatever happens.” Arthur Moses SC, acting for Roberts-Smith, alleged Person 41 was lying about the killing. “You can’t tell the difference between fact and fiction,” he said in a heated exchange. “Incorrect,” Person 41 replied. Another soldier at Whiskey 108, Person 14, gave evidence for the newspapers’ defence that he saw an Australian soldier carrying a distinctive weapon, a Minimi machine gun, throw a human-shaped object to the ground and fire a burst of bullets into it. He told the court he later saw Roberts-Smith carrying a Minimi during that mission. A third soldier, Person 42, also gave evidence for the newspapers that he helped pull “at least two” men out of the tunnel. He handed them over to other soldiers and never saw them again. Moses, for Roberts-Smith, put it to Person 42 that his evidence was not true “because you weren’t there”. “That is not true,” the soldier replied. Person 14’s account was similarly challenged. “It didn’t happen did it?” Moses asked. “It 100% happened,” Person 14 said. “You have come here to throw Mr Roberts-Smith under the bus any way you can, haven’t you?” Moses said. “No,” Person 14 replied. Roberts-Smith has consistently denied the newspapers’ version of events at Whiskey 108, describing them as “completely false”. In his evidence last year, he said he never ordered an elderly man shot, and he killed the man with a prosthetic leg outside Whiskey 108 because the man was a legitimate target, armed and running away, and was killed in accordance with troops’ rules of engagement. He said no people were taken out of the tunnel in the compound. “There were no people in the tunnel at Whiskey 108,” he told the court. Much of the cross-examination of these witnesses by Roberts-Smith’s legal team has focused on the uncompromising, cliquey nature of the tightknit SAS regiment, its hierarchies – official and unofficial – and its personality clashes. It has been put to witnesses that other soldiers, less effective in battle than Roberts-Smith, were motivated to tear him down, resentful of his success, his decorations and his apparent fearlessness. Soldiers called to appear by subpoena have been questioned on their attitudes to Roberts-Smith, asked if they were jealous of him, or suffering an envy frustrated by their own shortcomings. Long-serving soldiers have had their own service records pored over, their reprimands examined, their mental health questioned in open court. Some have spent a bare few hours in the witness box. Others have been days on the stand, asked to recount over and over some of the most difficult, intense and frightening moments of their careers. Last year, Roberts-Smith told the court that following his investiture with the Victoria Cross – won for gallantry at Tizak in 2010 – attitudes of other soldiers towards him changed dramatically. “For all the good it [the VC] has brought me and enabled me to do, it is unfortunately the case, in my instance particularly, that it has also brought me a lot of misfortune and pain. “It put a target on my back.” This has been a brutal and uncompromising trial. It has many weeks to run: the newspapers have called barely a third of their 30-strong witness list. Roberts-Smith has flagged he may call up to 18 witnesses-in-reply. But the shockwaves from the allegations and this subsequent trial have reverberated far beyond the dusty battlefields of Afghanistan and the close-confines world of the SAS. For Emma Roberts, the hardest moment came when she was asked about the impact on her family, and how the allegations against her former husband had affected their young twin daughters. She broke down recounting how one of her children had asked, amid the accusations and counter-claims, the secrecy and the stress: “Why doesn’t Dad smile any more?”",News/Australia news,Ben Roberts-Smith: how the soldier’s newspaper defamation suit went from battlefield to backyard,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/20/ben-roberts-smith-how-the-soldiers-newspaper-defamation-suit-went-from-battlefield-to-backyard
2/20/2022,"I’m not sure where Ōtepoti Dunedin’s Middle Beach ends and St Kilda begins but we park close to the muralled surf club, on the road that was closed for a month in 2021 so a mother sea lion and her pup could have safe passage from the golf course to the beach. We head right, away from the glitz, the groynes, the sand sausages, the coffee shop chic and the actual good surfers at St Clair beach.  Our New Zealand sea lions/pakake are a protected species, a taonga. Hunted in the 1800s, slow to recover, but the one we met in the surf was on the hunt for some fun. A mocha flash through the blue of the wave. Two of us thought it was a dolphin. One of us was already on the way to the shore, chased there. She left her friend’s surfboard in the shallows and we watched as the teenage sea lion nudged, nuzzled and mounted it for twenty minutes while we begged the bystanders for copies of their videos and photos. Pics or it didn’t happen. It did.Liz Breslin My favourite wild place is Castlepoint, Wairarapa. I live 30 minutes away and have been taking closeup photos of the shore for the past five years, even committing some of my favourites to my left arm as tattoos. The imposing Castle Rock looms over the sturdy, wind-blasted lighthouse and looks out to the Pacific: an impossible variety of blues and greens stitched together with white-crested waves. But I love to look down at my feet when on the beaches that stretch out from Castlepoint. The variety of miniature worlds on view is stunning. Close to the small Castlepoint settlement, the beach is gold to muddy orange with flecks of glittering black volcanic grains marking the edges of channels like veins on the back of an ancient hand or the exposed roots of trees threatening to twist your ankle on a bush path. Heading north along the shore you walk over sensuous, shockingly nude rocks in mutual embraces. Then lumps of pitted boulders shining with pink algae, green weed and tiny mussels clustered like seeds in a halved papaya. To reach farther north there’s a turnoff just after the golf course and it climbs steeply through solemn, dusky pines. On your left, convoluted folds of strata peak through soil and sand. Then as the road descends these same strata are revealed: sliced by the waves into perfectly straight lines of tombstones stretching out into a sometimes treacherous sea. And the sandscapes continue: lakes of snowy broken shells; collapsing dunes; wind-sculptured miniature canyons; braided kelp; fractal deltas – always changing, always fascinating.Ian Andrews My favourite place is a grassy knoll high on a ridge. To the west, the Tasman Sea, a becalmed Kapiti Island, and at my back the corrugated bush clad tangle of the Tararua Range. Behind the farm where father spent his youth lies a hilly backdrop, a bushy finger. The family name for this finger was the Fifty. On its southern side the Oriwa Ridge, a muddle of broken trees downed by a devastating hurricane in the 1930s. The route to the clearing was through a knotted skein of debris with the Oriwa ridge on the right and the Fifty on the left. There were no paths, no fence line, only a labyrinth of contours and an instinctive tack through tangled undergrowth, supplejacks, tree ferns, bush lawyer and uprooted trees. After steady scrambling we would finally break free on to the summit clearing. A fire lit, a newspaper screw of tea produced, a special tin of condensed milk, billy boiled and a mug of tea to savour. Snug in sleeping bag protected by a weatherproof cover and the ground softened with a fern bed, the southern cross overhead, the sound of a distant train lulled me into blissful sleep.Harley Stratton Since I could walk I’ve always loved the outdoors. I grew up in the Mangamuka Gorge in Hokianga in the late 80s. Me and mum n’ dad, we stayed in a tin roof shack with a small water tank and a gas bottle was used to do the cooking. The long drop was a good five minute walk in the dark with a hurricane lantern and sleep was always heralded by the call of the morepork owl. We had a dog named Brownie and a horse named Dooley. We used to eat the cat’s eye snails from the mangroves with garlic butter and I’d race my toboggan cut from an old plastic drum down the steep banks in the bush. I remember getting chased by a wild bull in the forest and hiding in the long grass outside the bush knowing it couldn’t spot me. Man those were the days. Since then I’ve become fond of so many beautiful places it’s a hard pick at best, so I’ll throw a quick shout out to a new place. Just recently I was at Stingray Bay in Coromandel. God it was so nice to finally leave Auckland after not having left the city in well over a year. I spotted three stingray while swimming in the pristine clear waters. I gotta say Aotearoa is and always will be a beautiful country.Jesse Williams For seven years in the 1990s, I could see the Mātakitaki River from my kitchen window and hear the rumble of river stones rolling under Horse Terrace Bridge at night. Today, the Mātakitaki is still my awa. In 1985 I left the coffee-coloured waters of the River Thames behind, and in 1994 found myself living beside a river so clear and blue that my daughter and I could cross on horseback and watch the riverbed ghosting by beneath our horses’ hooves. We heard the calls of ruru, kea and kākā and didn’t understand their peril. Recently I’ve spent more time in and on this river than any other in Aotearoa or England. It terrifies me – learning white-water kayaking in your 50s is not for the faint-hearted – but it uplifts, energises and washes me clean. I’m a new person after a paddle on the ‘taki. Kayaking became my way to be with this river, with my past, and with my son who grew up learning to roll and ferry and eddy on this magical stretch of water. Mātakitaki means to observe, to watch. I’ve watched this river for 27 years, and I still can’t take my eyes off it.Caroline Crick We could’ve been sisters except she turned six just two months earlier. Our pre-television New Zealand childhood was conducted outdoors in Te-Whanganui-a-Tara/ Wellington – at my place in the bush behind the henhouse, or on the freesia embankment. I preferred playing on the enchanted hillside behind her house. There we’d slide on shiny strappy flax leaves and tall grasses that bent flat as we passed down to rocks swathed in lichen with creviced dips where insects and dew gathered – tiny pools that varied with cloud, sunlight and tree-shade. We populated our wild hillside with imaginary creatures. Where the track forked we always took the left path on the shadowy side with the child-high weeds. At home I was mama’s helper with younger siblings. On our hillside, chore-free in school holidays, my chosen sister and I were adventurers in our own wilderness that remains close to my adult heart. Along with my Irish ancestry, it’s why I feel right at home on any hill on the west coast of Ireland. That numinous hillside now resembles a forgotten scrubby slope wedged behind suburban streets. Yet its gateway magic meant later travel was sometimes a half-familiar journey of return with hints of freedom I’d experienced at age six.Margaret Ranger",Opinion/Opinion,‘Aotearoa is and always will be beautiful’: New Zealand readers’ favourite wild places,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/19/aotearoa-is-and-always-will-be-beautiful-new-zealand-readers-favourite-wild-places
2/20/2022,"On Boxing Day 2020, a small group of people concerned about the closure of Perth’s homelessness services over Christmas set up a camp kitchen in a Fremantle park. They half expected nobody to turn up and to be packing up their trestle tables by mid-morning. Instead, an entire community bloomed.  The Fremantle tent city at Pioneer Park became a political flashpoint: a month-long, inescapable presence that reminded the Western Australian public of the most vulnerable among them. It’s been more than 12 months since police cleared Pioneer Park in late January 2021. Officers also dismantled another, less visible, camp at the Lord Street overpass in Perth. Campers were herded on to buses and taken to city hotels requisitioned as “emergency” accommodation. But the tent city had put the homelessness crisis in WA back on the state’s political agenda. The Labor premier, Mark McGowan, facing down a state election, initially promised $49m for “targeted homelessness packages”. Later, he announced a new 100-bed hostel for Aboriginal people living homeless in Perth, followed by $884m for housing and homelessness measures, including 3,300 new houses, in the September state budget. But those houses have yet to materialise and an inquiry this week revealed the hostel is less than half-full. So more than a year on, how much has actually changed for the state’s homeless? On the numbers alone, things appear to be worsening. In December 2021 there were 1,001 people known to be living homeless in Perth and Fremantle, according to the Zero Project – the same as a year prior. There were ​​15,700 households on the state’s social housing waitlist at the start of 2021; there are now 18,388 and wait times average two years, according to Shelter WA. The McGowan Labor government inherited a waitlist of 17,000 when it first took office in 2017 and appears to be back where it started. People are still falling through the cracks. Some of them have made headlines – in particular, a number of Aboriginal women who died homeless on Perth streets last winter. A vigil held at parliament house for one of them, Alana Garlett, resulted in another camp-out, which was cleared within days. Desmond Blurton-Cuiamara, a Ballardong Noongar man, was one of those campers. “All it was, was a little Band-Aid,” he says. “They took just us to hostels. It was all short term.” Blurton-Cuiamara has been homeless for eight years and is currently on the waitlist for housing. His story echoes that of many: eviction from public housing after the death of a parent who held the tenancy; a large debt accrued to the housing authority; time in prison; caring responsibilities; periods of couch-surfing in the overcrowded homes of those lucky enough to still have a tenancy. “We need to start looking after our own because the system is failing,” Blurton-Cuiamara says. “Our spirits are being broken severely because we don’t have a home on our own land. So how do we conduct ourselves? How do we start living?” Many of those involved in the tent city remain upset at the way campers were treated. McGowan blamed “anarchists” and “professional protesters”, saying they had taken advantage of and made “false promises to vulnerable people in order to cause disruption and trouble”. Those involved with the street kitchen say they were working with the homeless community to provide a necessary service – but it was positioned to raise public awareness. They wanted the crisis to be seen, not swept under the carpet, an objective they say was perfectly legitimate. Then there were the insinuations made about the camp’s residents. Upon announcing their intention to clear the camp, WA police associated it with a string of local crimes. But advocates say they there was no evidence the crimes had anything to do with the people sleeping at the park. “The premier lied about people being lured to the camp from accommodation that didn’t exist and made false claims about what happened there,” Jesse Noakes, the House the Homeless WA spokesperson who was an organiser at the camp, says. “He [McGowan] smeared and slandered a vulnerable community to get out of a political crisis the government created. The new housing and accommodation, including a new hostel for Aboriginal people, only exists because [that community] called for it and won.” A state government spokesperson said there had been “clear evidence of antisocial behaviour at the camp”, and that the government was “committed to providing genuine support for people experiencing homelessness – with more than $150m being invested this financial year on a range of critical services and programs including crisis and transitional accommodation for rough sleepers, and the operation of Western Australia’s first medical respite centre for homeless people”. WA Police declined to comment. A number of campers did receive housing afterwards. A team of homelessness services, led by Fremantle not-for-profit St Patrick’s on the instruction of the Department of Communities, was asked to respond. The department said this week that the response team had housed 72 of the 111 people they were working with. Guardian Australia understands they were mostly people from the tent city, the Lord Street camp and the subsequent parliament vigil. Charmaine Mourish, 49, was one of them. She had been homeless for 15 years after losing her public housing due to a stint in prison, and accruing a debilitating debt on her tenancy that prevented her from getting another – until she was picked up by the tent city response service. “I was [at the emergency accommodation] for a couple of weeks and then I got a place. I couldn’t get a place before that,” Mourish says. She is grateful for the house but says she knows others who received accommodation that was inappropriate and were back on the streets soon after. “I think they set us up to fail. They should put us in a place where there are people we can get on with,” she says. A spokesperson from the WA communities department said that at 31 January, there were more than 600 social housing properties “under construction or contract across Western Australia”. The 100-bed hostel in Perth, the spokesperson said, needed to take into account residents with very complex needs, and its maximum capacity would fluctuate accordingly. After the WA election, then housing minister Peter Tinley lost the portfolio. The homelessness brief – which sat separately with community services – was taken away from Simone McGurk in a cabinet reshuffle. Both of these responsibilities are now with minister John Carey, who so far has been well received by homelessness organisations. This week, the first hearings were held for a parliamentary inquiry into the financial administration of homelessness services in the state. Noakes credits the homeless community’s willingness to share their stories for the positive changes. “It’s not enough, of course, and comes too little too late for more than 100 people who have died homeless in Perth since the start of the pandemic, but it’s better than nothing, which is what we started with,” he says. “Most importantly, if most people who were at these camps have housing one year later, it makes the tent city the most effective strategy to end homelessness in WA’s history.”",News/Australia news,"‘Our spirits are being broken’: a year after Perth’s homeless tent city was cleared, the crisis remains",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/20/our-spirits-are-being-broken-a-year-after-perths-homeless-tent-city-was-cleared-the-crisis-remains
2/20/2022,"There are transformative moments in politics when the opposition gets gifted the political agenda. In the 1970s, it was the power of trade unions and inflation that gave the Tories control of the narrative, just as after 2008, it was the aftermath of the financial crisis. Today, Covid and Brexit have combined to make the condition of the people the number one political issue. The question of how to react to this threatens to overwhelm a Tory party that is divided between its libertarian wing and its one-nation advocates and whose leader is self-evidently unfit for high office. It is a new transformative moment. The news last week that January inflation hit a 30-year high of 5.5% to produce the biggest cost of living squeeze for 60 years is the backdrop to a mounting social crisis. The pressure is reflected in a falling birth rate and stagnating, even declining life expectancy, desperately unfair life chances, disempowerment, justified post-Brexit economic pessimism and social neglect, all alongside phenomenal private wealth. Labour, for the first time in 15 years, has the chance to command the agenda and do to its opponents what was once done to it.  “Levelling up” is the talismanic policy that brings all this together. Boris Johnson, for all his glaring deficiencies, had the wit to see that. It was not his alleged campaigning genius or what the deluded Europhobes think is the compelling case for Brexit that won the 2016 referendum and 2019 general election. Rather, it was the massive disaffection of millions of working-class voters with the status quo. There had to be change and levelling up, whose need is reinforced by the lethal unfairness of Covid, represents his personal commitment to deliver the change. Except, as the recent white paper on levelling up reveals in a way its drafters never imagined, this Conservative party cannot deliver. The first two-thirds of this at once intellectually exciting but finally disappointing document is among the best government analyses of Britain’s economic and social failings I have read. It is hard not to be impressed by the scrupulous marshalling of devastating data, ranging from the slow travel to work times to the disastrously higher prevalence of obesity in left-behind Britain – social science at its best. It recognises that the many self-reinforcing causes of this cruel inequality require numerous self-reinforcing responses. If the foundational framework it outlines is followed through, it could deliver, as the paper says, a generational £2.5tn increase in national output over and above whatever growth Britain might have otherwise expected. It is a fabulous national prize – except the last third of the paper demonstrates how far away such mobilisation is and the thinness of the government’s planned response. For some time, economic theory has been moving away from the simplistic “market is magic” doctrines that defined the past 40 years, but the white paper’s opening chapter marks the first decisive official rupture with that orthodoxy. The new consensus is to focus on how the state must mobilise and integrate the six capitals – human, financial, intangible, physical, institutional and social – that together constitute the “six-cylinder” model driving growth and, in particular, catalysing the growth serendipities available in densely populated cities. This is the “Medici” effect, so called because of the growth of the culturally and economically vibrant city states of the Italian Renaissance. It is combining these “agglomeration effects” with the right amounts of the varying capitals, brought together by empowered, self-confident local leaders, which is the alchemy of self-amplifying growth. No great economy can be built on a weak society; no great society can be built with a weak economy – and both need inspired local leadership. None of this is rocket science, even if it is a breakthrough for a Tory government, but it does require system change. Chapter two calls for just that. It is scathing about the consequences of too much political centralisation, the constant chopping and changing of Westminster-driven policies – 40 policies between 1975 and 2015 to promote regional growth – and the bewildering plethora of at least 100 sub-scale mini funds and pots of money for which local authorities have to bid, often with wholly different criteria. Instead, it argues there needs to be consistency over time, a massive streamlining of all the varying funds and a national consensus over interconnecting “missions” behind which the country can mobilise. It suggests 12, ranging from spreading out the national research and development budget more fairly to targets for improved life expectancy. Progress must be regularly and publicly reported. Above all, by 2030, every citizen should have the opportunity of being led by a local, empowered mayor to make these missions happen. So far, so good, then you hit the chapter on policy. The suffocating veto of Rishi Sunak’s Treasury is all too obvious. The imagination and verve disappear. Instead of streamlining all those sub-scale pots of money, the white paper boasts about them. Build up the British business and infrastructure banks to support local enterprise? Forget it. Serious transport investment so that journey times and frequencies match those of London? A joke. Search in vain for serious investment in the social infrastructure. New or repurposed institutions that might be decentralised to support the six-cylinder capitals’ growth model in all our localities? Conspicuous by their absence. The aim of creating one globally competitive city in each of our regions is noble – but over Sunak’s dead body. Nor is there any recognition that British capitalism itself is sorely in need of a makeover if it is to deliver its part. This is where Labour could pick up the thread. The country is ready to rally behind genuine levelling up. Money? Issue 100-year or even perpetual bonds to finance the vital capital spending. Create the institutions that will work with newly empowered mayors to revitalise our economy and society. Around the drive to net-zero, England from the Tyne to the Humber could reindustrialise around manufacturing windfarms, turbines, electric cars and batteries. Get back into the single market and export those green manufactures into the EU. Economic prospects for the next few years are dire: a shrinking working population, diminished trade, squeezed demand and stagnating investment together with the risk of falling house prices as interest rates rise. Against that outlook, Britain cannot let that potential £2.5tn of extra output go begging. The narrative, the foundational framework and the prize are there for the taking. All that is required is the chutzpah and vision to go for it.

2/20/2022,"Rachel Coghlan first witnessed death as a four-year-old when she watched her grandfather collapse and die in front of her. Later, as a physiotherapy student working as a carer in a nursing home, she found a woman dead in her bed. A nurse taught her not to recoil and instead showed her how to bathe and dress the body. Later again, working as a physiotherapist in London, she watched as a man from Sudan struggled to weigh up a diabolical choice between staying in the UK to access treatment, or returning home to his family but with no prospect of healthcare. He chose his family.  All three deaths laid the pathway for Coghlan’s decision to work in and research palliative care. After working in public health and research for more than a decade, she decided to return to hands-on work as a clinical palliative care physiotherapist in early 2020. “I figured I had a lot to give in that area. I wanted to find out what matters most to people and then support them on that journey.” Then the pandemic hit. For more than two years now, Covid has provided a daily reminder of a very specific picture of death; a death experienced alone save for medical staff armoured in PPE, family’s faces shining off an iPad. A disproportionate number of those lonely deaths have been in aged care. Earlier this month, federal health minister Greg Hunt was admonished as “disrespectful” after he pointed out that “approximately 60% of those that have agonisingly passed have been in palliative care ... The definition is that they have passed with Covid, and they are absolutely rightly counted as a national loss. But approximately 60% of those that have passed were in palliative care.” Hunt’s figures were later disputed, but palliative care professionals speaking to the Guardian interpret the distinction as a subtle inference that somehow these deaths are less important, and are concerned that such labels fuel a common misconception about palliative care treatment itself: that it is exclusively for people who are on the verge of death. The sector is already under resourced, struggling with fatigue and grappling with the fallout from witnessing immense loss, not just in terms of the number of deaths but of what people have ultimately been denied as a result of this pandemic – a decent death. “Palliative care is about helping someone to live as well as possible for as long as possible,” says Coghlan. She is also a board director for Palliative Care Australia (PCA), whose 2021 annual survey found only four in 10 Australians know that a person can ask for palliative care when they are first diagnosed with a terminal, chronic or degenerative illness. Three-quarters of Australians will likely utilise palliative care but many don’t understand the type of service it offers, partly because as a discipline it’s still not embedded across western medical practice, either at an institutional or educational level. Coghlan remembers the absence of the subject of death while training as a physiotherapist. “We didn’t talk about it. Even if you were on a hospital ward and a patient that you were treating died overnight, it was kind of just brushed over,” she says. “Palliative care wasn’t something that we were trained in or taught about. It never ever really crossed my mind.” “Almost no one who starts off in medical school gravitates to this area of medicine,” agrees Dr Helen Farrell, who’s worked as a palliative care physician across community- and hospital-based care for Barwon Health in Victoria for more than a decade. “Certainly as a med student I saw palliative care as largely pillow fluffing and hand holding.” Farrell had been working towards the field of gastroenterology. “I was seeing young people, primarily with liver disease, who were dying terribly. The focus was on trying to keep them alive rather than to keep them living as well as they could be. They were viewed as a liver rather than a whole person.” During a relieving term, Helen was allocated a covering position in palliative care. Suddenly she was introduced to “a field of medicine where the focus is on the person themselves, they’re the most important feature, rather than the disease process they happen to be living with.” It is palliative care’s intricate and personalised model – involving families, specialist health workers and volunteers – that has been disproportionally impacted by Covid. “We had to pivot to telehealth almost as soon as I returned to working as a palliative care physio,” says Coghlan. “And that has meant that some of our patients may have gone two years without having in-person contact with a health professional. It really affected the ability to build trust with a patient, build rapport with them and their family – and to be able to sit quietly with them, if they’re feeling upset or they are suffering.” Anna Nicholas, a clinical nurse consultant in palliative care at the Royal Hobart Hospital who’s worked in the field for more than 21 years, says: “Our bread and butter is about providing a rich service full of compassion, dignity, and making it individualised, and all of a sudden, all of that has been thrown up in the air and we have to see what we can catch as it comes down. “At the heart of palliative care, it is about caring. It’s about supporting families. It’s about providing one-on-one attention. So all of a sudden we’ve stripped back how many family members can come. Then we’ve stripped back essential people that are important in our service, such as allied health; so less contact with physiotherapists or occupational therapists, really important people like pastoral care and volunteers that are really integral to our service.” Nurses like Nicholas have not only had to fill the gaps left by these services, as well as cater to an increasing demand for in-home care due to patients’ reluctance to go to hospital, they’ve also had to help families grapple with unimaginable choices such as how to limit the numbers of loved ones allowed by the bed. “How does a family member pick who gets to come and say goodbye?” And although Tasmania may have been comparatively sheltered from the direct effects of Covid, it has shut its borders. “And a lot of people … finish university and everyone flies off and don’t come back and then we have to call them to say, ‘your mum or dad’s dying’, or your sister or your brother. And they’ve been unable to come back to Tasmania. “We don’t know the long-term consequences yet of these grief and loss issues.” Palliative care is often a “hard area of medicine to work in,” admits Farrell. “We see the best in people, but quite often we also witness families in terrible distress. Usually we get to counter that level of distress by getting to do the good things. Firstly, we can help them feel as good as they can in order to do the things they want to be doing, to help them tick off their bucket list, and then we can help them return to their home town, or spend time with loved ones, or go to the theatre. “The joy of this job comes from enabling people to do those meaningful things. And then, when those things are just not allowed, it’s distressing to watch these people being denied … their last wishes.” Coghlan remembers treating a man who had terminal cancer. “We had this big, intense family meeting and everyone agreed to try to get him home. I helped him walk back to his room. He spoke very little English. As I went to help him to sit down in his chair, he grabbed me and drew me into a bear hug. We didn’t talk. And then his wife joined in the hug. Within an hour we found out that he had been a close Covid contact and he was put into isolation and he died the next day without getting home. “I had the last hug,” says Coghlan. “There’s countless stories like that – health professionals having to hold people’s hands because the family can’t be there. We just don’t know the fallout of those things yet.” For Nicholas, the past two years of deprivation has highlighted how integral palliative care should be in health considerations. “It’s so important to refer early to palliative care. It’s an incredibly important specialty, just like cardiology or paediatric medicine. Palliative care is a very strong entity and specialty in itself that underpins lots of other areas of medicine and nursing.” The Lancet Commission on the Value of Death report, released last month, echoes Nicholas’s sentiments. The commission proposes “that our relationship with death and dying has become unbalanced, and we advocate a rebalancing. At the core of this rebalancing must be relationships and partnerships between people who are dying, families, communities, health and social care systems, and wider civic society.” The Lancet commissioners began work well before the pandemic, but then wondered if writing a report on death as Covid ravaged the globe would be welcomed or even informative. In fact, they argue, the Covid lens on dying in such a lonely, medicalised way has only served to illuminate the value of a good death. “Death and dying must be recognised as not only normal, but valuable. Care of the dying and grieving must be rebalanced, and we call on people throughout society to respond to this challenge.” “Working in palliative care is a privilege – it can make such a difference,” says Nicholas. “Just as it’s important to get the way we come into the world right – to have a good birth – it’s absolutely critical that we get death and dying right. Because it’s about what you leave for your family and friends, and that’s what people are going to remember.”",News/Society,‘I had the last hug’: palliative care workers lament the good deaths Covid took away,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/20/i-had-the-last-hug-palliative-care-workers-lament-the-good-deaths-covid-took-away
2/20/2022,"When Peter Coleman took a rapid antigen test just weeks after recovering from Covid-19, it was partially “for the fun of it”. Peter and his husband first tested positive to the virus on 10 January, during the post-holiday period that saw a spike in cases hit Melbourne and much of Australia.  “I was feeling really unwell but I didn’t expect to be positive, I thought I’d just double check,” he says. “I was on the phone with my friend after I took the test, and then I looked over and … I was just like – ‘I have to go’ … like, what the hell?” Peter is one of the unlucky Australians to have been reinfected with Covid-19 after making a full or partial recovery from the virus. No data on Covid-19 reinfections is currently being collated by the federal government. But a spokesperson from the Department of Health says the emergence of Omicron has seen a “significant increase” in the risk of reinfection compared with previous variants. “There is increasing evidence that there is little cross-neutralisation with Omicron,” the spokesperson says. “Whether Omicron infection protects against another Omicron infection is unclear and there remains significant uncertainty about the durability of immunity following infection with the emergence of Omicron.” When Peter first acquired the virus, he was hit by brain fog so bad he forgot how to order food on Uber Eats, along with muscle aches and fatigue. The second time, though, symptoms were very different – more akin to a common cold or flu. Peter, who works from home, says he had “no idea” where he acquired the second infection, only that it happened just outside the 30-day period when he initially tested positive. Fully vaccinated, Peter expects he had been hit by the Omicron strain, but has no way to know for sure. Peter says the second bout was relatively minor. When a nurse rang to check on him, she asked if he was feeling depressed. “I said ‘not depressed, unimpressed’ … Ru Paul’s Drag Race is really helping me through.” The Communicable Disease Network Australia “continues to monitor the evidence on reinfection and whether the definition of reinfection in the national public health guidelines requires review”. If someone is re-exposed to the virus in the 28 days after being released from isolation, they’re exempt from further quarantine – a decision last reviewed on 2 February. A senior research fellow at the Kirby Institute’s infection analytics program, Dr Deborah Cromer, says the likelihood of acquiring a Covid-19 infection twice is partially dependent on the variant and time since vaccination. While two doses of the vaccine provides protection against symptomatic disease upwards of 80% or 90% with Delta, with Omicron it drops to about 70% for mRNA vaccinations and 40-50% for AstraZeneca. Once receiving a booster, though, protection increases to 70-80%. “Very early on when the original strain was circulating, we were asking how much protection someone who has the disease had from getting the disease again,” Deborah says. “The trials show people who’ve had the Pfizer vaccine primary dose have twice as much [immunity] as someone who’s recovered from normal virus. But all vaccines are primarily giving you immunity targeted against the original strain.” Deborah says once someone has acquired the virus, they have specific immunity against that variant, as well as some general immunity against SARS-Cov-2. “You’re less likely to get the same variant again, but you’re certainly not completely protected,” she says. “Nevertheless, we would expect it to be less severe. Protection will grow, like what we see with the flu now.” While Covid-19 has some key differences from the flu, Deborah says similarities exist, as it is possible to have both viruses without symptoms or with mild symptoms, and repeated exposure encourages the body to have good immunity. “That’s probably where [Covid-19] will eventually go,” Deborah says. “Each time you experience a SARS-Cov-2 infection, your immunity will be boosted somewhat, which would mean the next time you’ll still have some immunity remaining.” Clancy Read first tested positive to the virus during Fiji’s second wave in August of last year. Living in Suva, her and her family had lived a relatively Covid-free life until “shit hit the fan” in April. “We were a close contact, and all went and got tested. My daughter, who was two at the time, was the only one who came back positive,” she says. “We were moving houses … it was just a disaster. So we isolated by ourselves, and as soon as we got to the new house, I got really sick. “It was in the chest, in my breathing, I’d be laying there in the middle of the night thinking ‘Oh God, at what point do you say I need to call it and seek medical attention?’” Clancy thinks that if she had been in Australia, she would have admitted herself to hospital – but feared being split from her husband and daughter and getting sicker alone. “The hardest part was not knowing how bad it was going to get,” she says. “The psychological symptoms were just as bad to the physical ones.” Then, after months of slow recovery, the Christmas period arrived and Clancy tested positive again. “We all got sick, and I assume it was Omicron,” she says. “I was flattened for two weeks, but it wasn’t as frightening … I wasn’t in tears in the night thinking ‘Oh my God, am I going to die?’ “Now the families that haven’t had Covid are nervous, they want to get it over and done with, whereas we’re happy to be out and about together … There’s an element of relief.” Deborah says that as the pandemic continued, it wouldn’t be “particularly unlikely” to be reinfected with the virus. “We’ve had a relatively small time window for people to have repeated infections in Australia. It might be unlikely [now] because of that,” she says. “But from a theoretical point of view, having Covid is not special – you get some level of immunity from having had the disease and some from vaccination. Both will boost your immunity.” Eleanor is still suffering from her exposure to the virus. She first tested positive to Covid at the start of January during the Omicron wave, after her housemate contracted the virus. Eleanor, who did not want to use her surname, had a range of symptoms – headaches, diarrhea, shortness of breath, insomnia – which began to subside within a few days. But then her second housemate returned from work out of town weeks later, and tested positive upon his arrival. This time she had different symptoms. “Fever, chills, cough, swollen glands.” Eleanor is normally an active person – she does rock climbing as well as regular workouts with a personal trainer. “Now I have shortness of breath, a racing heart,” she says. “I really struggle with exercise and get puffed really easily … and I have an ongoing cough triggered by laughing. “I get frustrated by people saying it’s a minor cold or flu. I’m a healthy 33-year-old and I’ve had shortness of breath for over a month now. Getting Covid twice is more than enough.”",News/World news, ‘What the hell?’: the unlucky Australians who have caught Covid twice ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/20/what-the-hell-the-unlucky-australians-who-have-caught-covid-twice
2/20/2022,"When Hannah Reeve tore up the grass on her suburban block in Burnie, Tasmania to make more room for growing vegetables, she faced the problem of what to do with the surplus. Her solution was to create the RavenOak pickup honesty stall out the front of her house, a set of salvaged wooden shelves laden with an ever-changing array of squash, zucchini, spring onions, eggs, beans, cucumber, rainbow chard, warrigal greens, spinach and broccoli.  Passersby can pick up the produce for the cost of a few coins, and a few items such as seeds are marked as free. It was four months before Reeve made her first sale, but now that people have gotten used to the idea, business is booming and neighbours are responding in kind, she says. “We’ve had people drop off big bags of lemons, or plums or boxes of rosemary, just free for people to take,” she says. Roadside honesty stalls have always been a feature of Australian country life. But since the pandemic started, more and more are popping up in urban areas as backyard growers who honed their green thumbs during the first lockdown help calm food security fears caused by the latest round of bare supermarket shelves. While there are no hard figures available on the growth of honesty stalls, Grow Free founder Andrew Barker has noted surging interest in “sharing carts”, which allow people to pick up (or leave) homegrown produce and seedlings for free. When Grow Free started 10 years ago, there were only one or two new carts a year. “Now there’s a new cart at least every week … and there’s 320 sharing carts across the country,” he says. Koren Helbig, who launched The Local Yum in Adelaide in September 2020, says she was keen to challenge the notion that city dwellers couldn’t be trusted with the dual temptations of fresh produce and an unattended cashbox. So far, she’s found that people who take her vegetables, seeds, olives, chutney and jam are mostly honest. “Theft is the number one concern of people who are considering creating one of these stalls,” says Helbig, who regularly fields enquiries about how she does it. The questions came up so frequently, she wound up writing a guide for would-be sellers. “We’ve had our stall for 18 months now and in that time we’ve only had a handful of instances of theft or vandalism,” she says. Reeve’s experience is similar. She says she’s only had one instance where someone “wiped out” the contents of her stall. “They took the whole lot – two dozen eggs, some preserves, zucchini,” she says. “That one was hard … but there’s always going to be someone, and who am I to say that they weren’t in need? So instead of reacting, we put a little addition on our sign that said, ‘Free if you can’t afford to pay’,” she says. Rachel Fordyce, who sells home-propagated plants through the Kenmar honesty stall in Brisbane’s Wynnum West, is similarly philosophical about what supermarkets call “shrinkage”. She discourages theft by zip-tying her money tin to the stall shelves, but otherwise doesn’t worry. “There’s probably been a couple of plants gone walkabout, or maybe somebody’s put 20 cents in instead of $1, but that doesn’t really bother me, I figure that’s part and parcel of doing it this way,” she says. Another concern for would-be stallholders is falling foul of local government regulations, which differ depending on where stalls are based. Brisbane City Council, for instance, points out that permits are required to operate a commercial activity on council-owned land; that building approval is required if stalls on private property exceed certain dimensions; and that a food licence is required if fruit or vegetables are cut or peeled. But a spokesperson noted that council had not received any complaints or reports about honesty stalls – and none of the stallholders I spoke to had attracted any attention from authorities. Adelaide’s Jane Copeland, who sells sourdough from a stall, at a location she requested remain undisclosed for privacy reasons, says that when it comes to the legalities involved, ignorance is bliss. “I don’t want to know,” she says. “I don’t even know who would shut it down.” She started the venture in August 2020, after taking early retirement. She mills her own flour, bakes 18 loaves and 10 baguettes four days a week and pops them in a tiny stall hanging from her front fence. Everything sells within an hour of being placed there. “People want to reclaim something that’s simple and honest, good, beautiful and pure,” she explains. “[Bread] is just flour, salt and water.” But the most compelling benefit she’s seen is the strengthening of social bonds. “I’ve met a billion people who live nearby, who I never knew before,” Copeland says. “They all meet each other and bring their dogs and talk to each other and it’s really the most amazing thing.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘People want to reclaim something pure’: the rise of the urban honesty stall,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/20/people-want-to-reclaim-something-pure-the-rise-of-the-urban-honesty-stall
2/20/2022,"First reports suggested that this service was going to be withdrawn, but news agency reports on Saturday indicated it was now likely to be maintained. Officials were quoted as saying that the government’s Living with Covid plan would maintain “resilience against any future variants with ongoing surveillance capabilities”.  The move comes after senior statisticians argued that some form of the Office for National Statistics’ coronavirus study should remain in place. Sir David Spiegelhalter of Cambridge University told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the ONS’s Covid-19 Infection Survey had been vital for monitoring behaviour. “Lots of people are saying how important it is, particularly the statistical community.” This point was backed by Prof Sylvia Richardson, president of the Royal Statistical Society, who said: “Throughout the pandemic, national surveillance studies have provided invaluable information to support decision making.” The legal duty to self-isolate after testing positive for coronavirus is expected to end this week. The prime minister is due to announce the move as part of his “living with Covid” plan, in which all pandemic regulations that restrict public freedoms in England will be terminated. Local authorities will be required to manage outbreaks with existing public health powers, as they would with other diseases. Downing Street said pharmaceutical interventions would “continue to be our first line of defence”, with the vaccine programme remaining “open to anyone who has not yet come forward”. But the change worries many scientists. “Removing the requirement for isolation in the face of high infection levels will inevitably result in increased spread of the virus,” said Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist at Warwick University. “This may give people a false sense of security. We must not let our guard down.” Free home-delivered lateral flow tests for all are likely to be scrapped in the near future. The move will save the government a great deal of money but will make it difficult to maintain mass surveillance of the virus, as scientists have warned. “Even though the pandemic may appear to be ending, it has not yet ended,” said Jonathan Stoye, a virologist at the Francis Crick Institute. “There are no guarantees that new, more pathogenic variants will not emerge. Despite the successes of vaccination, many people are still at risk. Any significant reduction in testing will jeopardise lives and compromise our ability to monitor the appearance of new variants.”",News/World news,What happens next with Covid protocols?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/what-happens-next-with-covid-protocols
2/20/2022,"Tributes have been paid to an Irish council worker who “died in the line of duty” after being hit by a falling tree during Storm Eunice. Billy Kinsella, 59, from Clonroe in Gorey, was clearing debris from a road close to his home in Co Wexford when he was struck.  The father of one was an employee of Wexford county council, and was fatally injured attending the scene of another fallen tree in Ballythomas. Sinn Féin councillor Fionntan Suilleabhain lived close to Kinsella and grew up with his family. She was among the first to pay tribute. “People in the area are devastated. It is such a tragedy for his wife, Rita, and their only child Conor,” she said. “Billy died in the line of duty while out doing council work and attending the scene of a fallen tree. He died round the corner from where we both live and he died in a manner that makes it most tragic. “He comes from a well-respected family and a very hard-working family. He was a quiet family man who was devoted to his son, who he brought to sporting events all over. Conor plays for the under-20s Wexford team and would be heavily involved in GAA, like Billy’s father was before him. People are very shocked.” Fianna Fáil councillor Donal Kenny said Kinsella was a “nice, easy-going fella” and was “one of those lads who got on with his day’s work”. “He was out doing his job to keep the roads clear,” Kenny said. “It is very difficult for his family.” Elsewhere, ESB repair crews worked through the night to restore electricity supplies to more than 70,000 users. On Saturday afternoon, about 7,000 homes and businesses remained without power. “Due to the severity of the damage to the electricity network in the south-west region, some customers in south Kerry and West Cork will again be without power overnight and we apologise for the particular difficulty this causes,” ESB said in a statement.
