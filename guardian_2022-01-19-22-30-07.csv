1/19/2022,"The Tory grandee David Davis told Boris Johnson: “In the name of God, go,” during an often chaotic prime minister’s questions overshadowed by intense doubt about Johnson’s future. Following a fierce set of exchanges between Johnson and Keir Starmer, Davis rose to tell Johnson that he had spent weeks defending him from “angry constituents”, but that repeated reports about lockdown-breaching parties were too much.  The former Brexit secretary said: “I expect my leaders to shoulder the responsibility for the actions they take. Yesterday he did the opposite of that. So, I will remind him of a quotation which may be familiar to his ear: Leopold Amery to Neville Chamberlain: ‘You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing. In the name of God, go.’” Asked by the Guardian afterwards what had motivated him to make an intervention, Davis said the interview given by the prime minister to Sky News on Tuesday was “not what I expect from a leader”. “Up until now I had been supporting him ... but it’s not leadership,” he said. “Yesterday’s interview was an attempt to escape responsibility not to shoulder it. And that is a test of leadership.” It is understood junior colleagues had been pressing Davis to make a statement publicly calling for the prime minister to go, saying the situation needed a “big figure” to intervene. Earlier in prime minister’s questions, Starmer castigated Johnson for what he called “absurd and frankly unbelievable” explanations over Downing Street parties. Despite speculation that the threshold of formal letters from Tory MPs seeking a confidence vote could be reached later on Wednesday, and the defection of the Bury South MP, Christian Wakeford, from the Tories to Labour just before PMQs, Johnson put up a bullish defence of his record. One cabinet minister claimed Wakeford’s defection was “unifying” and would “draw a line under the whole thing”. In response to Davis’s intervention, they shrugged. But another cabinet minister said they recognised the prime minister’s position was “precarious”. Starmer took every opportunity to condemn and even mock the prime minister, with the Labour leader at one point noting the noisy government benches, asking if “the chief whip told them to bring their own booze”, a reference to the invitation sent to No 10 staff in May 2020. “Every week the prime minister offers absurd and frankly unbelievable defences to the Downing Street parties, and each week it unravels,” Starmer told the Commons. “First he said there were no parties, then the video landed, blowing that defence out of the water. Next he said he was sickened and furious, when he found out about the parties – until it turned out that he was at the Downing Street garden party. “Then last week he said he didn’t realise he was at a party and, surprise surprise, no one believed him. So this week he’s got a new defence – nobody warned me that it was against the rules. Since the prime minister wrote the rules, why on earth does he think this new defence is going to work for him?” In response to this and further questions, Johnson told Starmer he would have to wait for the outcome of a report into the parties by the senior civil servant Sue Gray, saying at one point: “I have said what I have said about the events in No 10.” But Starmer kept pushing over Johnson’s explanation for why he attended an event in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020. “It requires the prime minister to expect us to believe that whilst every other person who was invited on 20 May was told it was a social occasion, he alone was told it was a work meeting,” the Labour leader said. “It also requires the prime minister to ask us to accept that, as he waded through the empty bottles and platters of sandwiches, he didn’t realise it was a party. Does the prime minister realise how ridiculous that sounds?” Starmer ended by saying Johnson was “trying to save just one job – his own”. Johnson replied by talking up his record over Covid and vaccinations, saying this was “thanks to the work of staff up and down Whitehall, across government, throughout the NHS”. He added: “And I am intensely proud of what this government has done.”",News/Politics,"David Davis tells Boris Johnson ‘in the name of God, go’ at chaotic PMQs",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/david-davis-tells-boris-johnson-in-the-name-of-god-go-at-chaotic-pmqs
1/19/2022,"A woman acting as a “guerrilla journalist” when she filmed inside a hospital in an attempt to prove her belief that lockdown measures were disproportionate has been convicted of a public order offence. Debbie Hicks, 47, a former teacher and psychologist, filmed twice at the Gloucestershire Royal hospital in Gloucester in December 2020 and told staff who challenged her she could do what she wanted as she paid her taxes.  Hicks, from Stroud, had argued that she was exercising her right to freedom of expression and trying to expose what she believed was a false government narrative that hospitals were full of patients with Covid. But finding her guilty of using threatening words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, the district judge, Nicholas Wattam, said staff had the right to work without being molested. Richard Posner, prosecuting, had told Cheltenham magistrates court that Hicks, who had no previous convictions, went to the hospital on 27 December 2020 because she felt restrictions were over the top. Live-streaming her visit, she could be heard saying: “It is absolutely dead, it’s a ghost town, I’ve never seen it so quiet. Where are all the people dying from the second wave?“This is the proof we’ve needed in Gloucestershire, we’ve been locked down into tier 3 for this? An empty hospital, this is a disgrace. All our people in our country desperately waiting for treatment ... This is making me so angry walking around here. Look at the truth.” On the second visit the following day, she was challenged by two staff. Posner said: “Ms Hicks’ response was confrontational, derogatory and aggressive.” Occupational therapist Katie Williams, who challenged Hicks, said she had been working under extreme pressure for almost a year and had found the incident distressing. Sophie Brown, a senior physiotherapist, said when she asked Hicks not to film, she replied she paid her taxes “so I can do what I want”. Hicks’ lawyer Merry Van Woodenberg told the court Hicks was acting as a guerrilla journalist and she had a right to freedom of expression under article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The barrister said her client had lost her chance of employment because of her political views and told the court her fees had been paid by others who had similar concerns to Hicks. But finding her guilty, the judge said: “Miss Williams and Miss Brown had the misfortune to encounter Mrs Hicks in their place of work. They do not deserve to be molested by Mrs Hicks when at work and should be protected by the law.” Hicks told the court she was unemployed and struggling with debt. She was fined £120 and told to pay prosecution costs of £775 and a victim surcharge – which is used to fund services for victims – of £34, a total of £929.

1/19/2022,"Standup resembles biblical preaching, according to Australian writer Anthony Noack, a case he tries to make by performing the Book of Ecclesiastes in club-comedy style. I remain unpersuaded. The Preacher, performed to no audiences and delivered digitally as part of the Living Record festival, begins intriguingly, as Noack – in character as Dave Davidson – lures us in with lame jokes and suggestions of a life going off the rails. But that persona becomes tedious then evaporates altogether, and the show is revealed as a more or less faithful – and seemingly interminable – Bible recital. And lo, I was transported traumatically to my few childhood experiences of churchgoing, which launched me into a life of enthusiastic atheism. While the matter of Noack’s show, and Ecclesiastes itself, is substantial – it’s about wisdom versus foolishness, and the meaning (and futility) of life – in performance it’s just a litany of fortune-cookie pronouncements. “What has been will be again,” “to everything there is a season”, and so on, without any coherent train of thought, far less any discernible jokes to cling to.  If there are meaningful parallels between standup and biblical philosophising, the point would be better made by a freer approach, one that took Ecclesiastes’ arguments, re-contextualised them and re-purposed them as comedy. But Noack cleaves tightly to the original, fulfilling his obligations to humour by grinning a lot, speaking in a jaunty-philosophical tone and adding “what’s the deal?” at the end of every homily. Far from demonstrating any standup/preaching affinity, text and delivery pull in precisely opposite directions. The result is still identifiable as preaching, more’s the pity, but not remotely so as comedy.

1/19/2022,"The Dutch government is facing criticism after it emerged that a Rembrandt masterpiece is to be bought by the state from the Rothschild family through a tax haven in the south Pacific. A debate in the country’s senate heard that the €175m (£145m) purchase of The Standard Bearer would be from a trust located in the Cook Islands whose holding company is located in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, also a tax haven.  The painting, a three-quarter-length self-portrait that was a precursor for the Dutch renaissance’s most famous work, The Night Watch, was loaned to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam in 2019 for its Rembrandt-Velázquez exhibition. “The reason we all know this is that this has all been revealed in the so-called Panama Papers and is all publicly available to find out,” said Henk Otten, an independent MP who was previously a member of the rightwing Forum for Democracy. “How does this transaction relate to the policy of the Dutch government to combat tax avoidance, is our question to the state secretary. SMEs and freelancers who are a day late with their VAT return will immediately receive a hefty fine. Why is the state involved in such constructions?” Senators have also raised concerns that the government could not be sure of the authenticity of the work or its ownership given the opaque nature of the purchase. The culture minister, Gunay Uslu, said before a vote in favour of the purchase that the appropriate due diligence had been done. She said: “It is my understanding that it has already been legally established that the person we are buying it from is the right person.” Of the total price of The Standard Bearer, or De Vaandeldrager, €150m is being provided by the government. The Rembrandt Association and the Rijksmuseum will pay the remaining €25m. There has also been criticism of the timing of the purchase given the tough times faced by the Dutch arts and culture sector during the pandemic. The minister conceded she felt “uncomfortable” that the sale had fallen during the pandemic but said it was a once-in-a-generation opportunity to take the painting out of private hands. Once the sale is completed within the next four weeks, The Standard Bearer will tour museums in all parts of the country. Uslu said: “There is no other work from his baroque period in the Netherlands Collection; it is also the prelude to The Night Watch, and Rembrandt distinguishes himself here for the first time as a rebellious artist. Moreover, The Standard Bearer is inextricably linked to the history of the Netherlands.”",News/World news,Dutch purchase of Rembrandt work criticised over tax haven link,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/dutch-purchase-of-rembrandt-work-criticised-over-tax-haven-link
1/19/2022,"As the sunlight slowly began to fade on Wednesday in Melbourne Park, two of the top women’s players were holding fort on two most prominent courts across the grounds. On Rod Laver Arena, the night session was all but filled to its capped attendance as the crowd watched Naomi Osaka continue her comeback with a 6-0, 6-4 win over the USA’s Madison Brengle. But next door, only a smattering of fans had hung around for the end of the day session on Margaret Court Arena to watch as Barbora Krejcikova, the fourth seed, picked apart Wang Xiyu of China 6-2, 6-3 to move on to the third round.  Despite the best efforts of Wang, a talented 20-year-old with a wicked lefty serve, many of Krejcikova’s vast talents were on show. Her hooked topspin forehand, one of the standout shots in the women’s game, commanded most exchanges and she continually changed direction of the ball, spreading it to every part of the court. Meanwhile, she demonstrated her comprehensive toolbox of shots with her volleys, sharp angles and backhand slice. While she may not receive the attention reserved for more prominent players on the women’s tour, Krejcikova is quietly one of the stories of women’s tennisnow. Two years ago, she was ranked outside the top 120 when she won her first grand slam main draw match at the 2020 Australian Open as a qualifier. Until that point, she had spent her career humbly trying to become a top 100 player. That she became the French Open singles champion within 18 months was a shocking feat in itself, but one of the great revelations of the past eight months has been how she has backed up those two glorious weeks in Paris. Krejcikova compiled a 29-4 record across the spring and summer, winning three titles, and her form has only continued into the new year. Last week, she started her season by reaching the final at the Sydney International in a stacked field. Despite the fourth seed by her name, there are frequent reminders of her low profile. She is still wearing the same Head outfit she wore as she won the French Open and her inexperience with certain duties that top players must undertake is clear. As Krejcikova walked towards the exit after her match, an official on the side waved frantically at her to remain on the court – she is still not used to giving an on-court interviews after each match. Over the past months, Krejcikova’s results have made it clear that she intends to remain a top player and considering her sustained doubles success – she remains one half of the No 1 doubles team alongside Katerina Siniakova – she was arguably the overall player of the season last year. In Melbourne she is one of the tournament favourites and she continues to deal with her new reality with her typical composure. “There is always pressure, there has always been pressure, there is always going to be pressure,” she said recently. “I think the most important thing is just to really go and enjoy, and that’s what I’m planning to do. That’s something I’m focusing on.” As Krejcikova moved on without incident, Osaka faced her first obstacle of the tournament. After breezing through the first set against Brengle, the second set became a much tighter affair and Osaka lost serve to trail 3-4 after a cascade of errors. As she returned to her chair, Osaka gestured as if she was going to strike a ball in fury or throw her racket. But that lapse was only momentary. Osaka refocused immediately and she punctuated each of her following forehand winners with fist pumps and positive gestures. In a sight that has played out many times in big tournaments over the past few years, Osaka reeled off three straight games to win. “In that moment of course I was really disappointed with myself, but I also think these are the type of matches that I need to play in grand slams to get broken and to figure out a way to fight back in really crucial times,” she said. As Osaka moved towards the third round, at least one notable person was watching. Andy Murray was impressed enough by Osaka’s first set display to ask his fans on Twitter: “Anyone hit the ball cleaner from the baseline than @naomiosaka?” After one respondent argued that all men’s players do so, he assured them that this was not the case. “Definitely means a lot,” said Osaka on Murray’s support. “For me it was a really cool moment. It’s a little bit shocking, because when you’re playing, you never really think about the TV broadcasting it and other people are watching. So, yeah, definitely really surreal. I hit with him once like three years ago, and it was like a memory that’s really dear to me. It was really cool just to have someone like him talking about my game.” Osaka, the defending champion, will now face 20-year-old Amanda Anisimova, a former teenage prodigy in the midst of a resurgence, in the next round. It is a difficult third round match but one that comes with a particular reward. Should she win, a blockbuster fourth round against Ash Barty, the top seed, could follow.",Sport/Sport,Osaka eases through in the spotlight while Krejcikova stays under the radar,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/19/osaka-eases-through-in-the-spotlight-while-krejcikova-stays-under-the-radar-australian-open-tennis
1/19/2022,"Boris Johnson has announced the end of all Covid measures introduced to combat the Omicron variant from next week, including compulsory mask-wearing on public transport and in shops, guidance to work from home and vaccine certificates. The prime minister also said the legal requirement on people with coronavirus to self-isolate would be allowed to lapse when the regulations expired on 24 March, and that date could be brought forward.  Responding for Labour, Keir Starmer said he would back the move as long as it was supported by evidence, saying Johnson must “reassure the public he is acting to protect their health, not just his job”. Updating MPs in the Commons, Johnson said so-called plan B restrictions would be lifted on 26 January, the pre-set review point the measures introduced in December as Omicron swept across the UK. Johnson argued that he had taken a “different path” to much of Europe, but that Covid data was “showing that, time and again, this government got the toughest decisions right”. The swift change has been seen as an attempt by Johnson to placate Conservative MPs angry with him over reports about lockdown-breaching parties in No 10 by introducing a move demanded by many backbenchers, including the Covid Recovery Group. However, there is concern among some directors of public health that ending all restrictions immediately could be too soon, especially in the north of England, where the Omicron wave hit slightly later than in London. To cheers from some on the Tory benches, Johnson also announced an immediate end for the need for secondary pupils to wear masks at school. “From tomorrow, we will no longer require face masks in classrooms and the Department for Education will shortly remove national guidance on their use in communal areas,” he said. “In the country at large we will continue to suggest the use of face coverings in enclosed or crowded spaces, particularly when you come into contact with people you don’t normally meet - but we will trust the judgment of the British people and no longer criminalise anyone who chooses not to wear one.” Replying to the statement, Starmer said Labour “does not want to see restrictions in place any longer than necessary”. The Labour leader said he would back the relaxation “as long as the science says it is safe”.",News/World news,"All plan B Covid restrictions, including mask wearing, to end in England",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/boris-johnson-announces-end-to-all-omicron-covid-restrictions-in-england
1/19/2022,"As the energy crisis deepens, the UK government is frantically searching for ways to provide relief to households facing sharp increases in gas and electricity bills. In the latest development, Downing Street is said to be considering paying energy supply companies when wholesale energy prices are high in the hope that they do not pass on rising costs to consumers. When wholesale prices fall below a certain threshold, the energy companies would give money back to the government. In effect, this amounts to an emergency bailout that guarantees the income of private energy companies when wholesale prices rise. The energy companies, perhaps unsurprisingly, support the plan and financial journalists have described it as a “radical intervention”. But subsidising energy companies is not radical in any meaningful sense of the term. In fact, the proposed initiative is firmly aligned with the status quo, in which private companies reap massive profits through the good times, and have their losses absorbed by the state through the bad.  Though the details of the latest government plan are scant, there are already plenty of reasons to be sceptical about its effectiveness in tackling the energy crisis. The first is that it comes far too late to save many of the smaller companies in the sector. Over the past year roughly half of the energy suppliers in the UK, nearly 30 in total, have already gone bust. The majority of these failed companies were swallowed up by one of the five firms that own the “big six” energy suppliers. One of the main impacts of the crisis has therefore been to further consolidate the power of the big six in an already heavily concentrated energy sector. And at present there is little reason to believe that the dominant players are in need of government support. The financial impact of the energy crisis on suppliers will only be confirmed in the months ahead once they begin to release their financial reports for the fourth quarter of 2021. But early indications are that some of the largest companies in the sector fared very well during the initial onset of the energy crisis. For example, in its latest financial statement, SSE plc enjoyed truly eye-watering operating profit margins (operating profits-to-revenues) of 55% from April to September 2021, a period during which wholesale price hikes were already rattling energy markets. The big six don’t need to be subsidised through a price stabilisation mechanism, nor do they deserve it. A recent briefing from Common Wealth thinktank lays this out in considerable detail. The returns that the big six offer to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks far outstrip their returns to the public finances through tax payments. Since 2010, the big six have spent more than £40bn on shareholder payouts, nearly double the amount they paid in income taxes. And the major shareholders of the big six, it should be noted, principally comprise foreign governments, as well as asset management firms and investment banks that mainly service the asset-rich, not the lower-income households most strained by the energy crisis. Rather than offering subsidies to the big six, the UK government should instead focus on taxing them and using the money to address the cost of living crisis. If properly designed, a windfall tax targeting the large energy suppliers and the large North Sea gas producers offers an effective and just way of curbing the most regressive effects of the energy crisis. Unlike this temporary price stabilisation mechanism, the energy giants are dead set against the windfall tax. But it is a policy that enjoys widespread support and has historical precedent, the last windfall tax being implemented by the Tory government to raise £2bn in 2011. At the same time, a windfall tax needs to be coupled with a more ambitious strategy of bringing the energy suppliers back into public ownership. Since privatisation of the UK energy system began in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the government has been forced to constantly intervene to address a seemingly endless parade of market failures. Instead of merely intervening to prop up a dysfunctional and unstable market, the government now needs to rapidly de-marketise the energy system to bring it some much-needed stability. Without a publicly owned energy system safeguarded from the whims and pressures of the market, it is difficult to see how the UK government can secure clean and affordable energy for all.

1/19/2022,"Alexander Zverev needed no reminding of the last time he played John Millman at a grand slam. “Five and a half hours, five sets – he’s a very difficult player to beat,” he said before his second-round match against the Australian. That match was the third round at Roland Garros in 2020, when the then 89th-ranked Millman rallied from two sets down and pushed him to five stanzas in a thriller that frustrated Zverev to the point of smashing his racket on to the ground.  A lot has happened since then. That same year Zverev made his first first slam final at the US Open. In 2021 he climbed back up to world No 3, won Olympic gold and then the ATP Finals, beating the only two players ranked higher in Novak Djokovic and Daniil Medvedev. With Djokovic gone from his side of the draw and Medvedev safely on the other, the 2022 Australian Open could yet be the German’s tournament. Getting there will very much depend on the level of consistency for which the 24-year-old is known but somewhat lacked in his opening match at Melbourne Park. On Wednesday night it faltered again only to return just in time to avoid another marathon with the popular local up the other end and finish the match 6-4, 6-4, 6-0. “My tactic today was to hit the ball as slow as possible,” Zverev said in a post-match interview with the Australian wheelchair tennis champion, Dylan Alcott. “That was my mindset going into the match, but hopefully I can hit it even harder next match and harder the next match after that.” Alcott, who himself won the Paralympic men’s singles gold in Tokyo 2020 on his way to a golden slam, asked Zverev where he keeps his medal and received an unexpected response. “That’s actually a good question because my brother took it for a media appearance,” Zverev said. “He didn’t give it back to me yet. I don’t know where it is for the past five months. Hopefully he hasn’t sold it on eBay or something.” Millman, for his part, gave a thoroughly decent account of himself until the third set, the world No 89 matching his counterpart eight years his junior in an exhibition of impeccable groundstrokes. During the second set he won three consecutive service games to love and forced Zverev to serve himself out of a hole on more than one occasion with support of a vocal but overall pleasant home crowd at Rod Laver Arena. “I could really feel that you guys have been locked down for two years,” Zverev said. “I’m prepared that everybody will hate me after the match. It’s quite accurate and that’s my mindset. I’ll get a lot of boos and hopefully everybody will cheer against me. I’m kidding.” For all Millman’s hustling, though, Zverev simply had the edge, the tactical nous to force a long rally to a head and an at-times uncanny capacity to shave the tiniest outside sliver of the baseline. To offset his 38 unforced errors – a far higher tally than Millman’s 16 – he hit 37 winners to nine and served 14 aces to zero, and will face Moldovan qualifier Radu Albot on Friday with a keen eye to tougher tests awaiting on the other side.",Sport/Sport,Alexander Zverev shrugs off Australian Open boos to power past John Millman,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/19/australian-open-tennis-alexander-zverev-john-millman
1/19/2022,"The final nail-biting episode of the sixth series of Line of Duty was watched by 12.8 million people last May, the biggest audience for a television drama for 20 years. Now more than 5 million people have watched a four-minute clip of AC-12’s feared officers interrogating the man at the heart of a real-life scandal gripping the nation: Boris Johnson.  The spoof video was posted on Twitter by its creators, the satirical artists Led By Donkeys, on Tuesday and was swiftly retweeted by the Line of Duty writer Jed Mercurio with the words “brilliant work”. ""Mother of God, you must think we were born yesterday, fella.""pic.twitter.com/AOl2D4f0Bc Using clips from the television series cut with excerpts of Johnson’s statements on so-called “partygate”, it purports to show the prime minister being questioned by AC-12 investigators Ted Hastings, Steve Arnott and Kate Fleming as part of Operation BYOB. “The facts are plain for everyone to see,” Hastings, played by Adrian Dunbar in the TV drama, tells Johnson. During lockdown “people were making incredible sacrifices,” adds Fleming. “But not you, oh no. You partied,” Hastings continues. “We’re satisfied that you knowingly and intentionally flouted the rules because you believe you’re above the law. Well, fella, you’ve got another thing coming, believe you me.” “There are rules,” says Hastings. “The rules that bind us as a society and as a people.” “Fairness,” says Fleming. “Decency,” says Arnott. “Integrity,” says Hastings – over an image of Captain Tom Moore, who raised £33m for the NHS in the first lockdown before dying of Covid-19 at the age of 100. Ben Stewart, one of the Led By Donkeys collective, told the Guardian: “When the police aren’t doing their job, who do you call for? You call for AC-12.” Making the video had been cathartic, he added. “The impunity that has allowed Johnson to operate in the way that he has for years is finally being challenged. And we wanted to make a visual cultural representation of that by getting him in a room with AC-12.” Asked if the Line of Duty actors or Mercurio had assisted with making the video, Stewart said: “I can neither confirm nor deny that.” When the group had finished the video, he said, “we thought we’ve nailed it, but it’s really difficult to tell until you put it out there. But it’s flying.” Led By Donkeys worked with Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice to create a memorial wall of pink hearts opposite parliament. “We spent a lot of time down there with bereaved families, painting hearts with them. And so we’ve come to see the party scandal, to a certain extent, through their eyes. There are people who sat in a car outside a hospital, unable to hold their loved ones’ hands as they slipped away from Covid, but they just wanted to be close to them. “Johnson regarded the sacrifices that people were making in such a cavalier way and people are deeply hurt. I think it’s important that there is a price to pay for making these rules and breaking these rules, because people will live for the rest of their lives with [the impact] of abiding by the rules. This matters to people on a deep and visceral level.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson grilled by Line of Duty team in spoof video viewed by 5m,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/boris-johnson-grilled-by-line-of-duty-team-in-spoof-video-viewed-by-5-million
1/19/2022,"Most of April Ashley’s 86 years were the hard going of a pioneer’s life, with repeated rejection and scandal-blighted reverses. But she never regretted the day in 1960 when she risked her life to become her true self through gender realignment surgery, among the earliest to undertake such a thing. The operation cost her prolonged pain, besides a difficult-to-raise £2,500, but in old age she said that every morning there was “still a bit of joy left” at the memory of the transformation. As to tough times: “Chins up … be as brave as you can.” Her beauty, instinctual style and understanding of the artifice of glamour pre-dated the surgery. After it, she briefly had chances as a model, projecting a 1950s soignee manner animated by a new naughtiness; she had an aristo voice and native scouse wit, too. David Bailey, Brian Duffy and Terences Donovan and O’Neill photographed her, even in lingerie; she didn’t hide who she was and how she had become so, and they didn’t care, as Ashley delivered a great picture. She updated her image through life – kook, 60s socialite, private-life professional, and in her late years, carefully edited duchess. Few have ever carried off with grace the gown and squishy headgear of an academic honour, but she did.  As a young adult the released joie de vivre of her changed self made her a welcome good-time girl at any party, and she crossed class and social boundaries as an early celebrity funded by largesse – champagne sent to her table, gifts of clothes and jewels, rides in private jets to swinging places. All were a huge expansion of life. She had been born in Liverpool and christened George, one of the six children of Frederick Jamieson, a Royal Navy cook, and his wife, Ada (nee Brown). Father was often away at sea and drunk on leave; when Ashley visited his deathbed long afterwards – the first time he had seen her as a woman – he told her “Darling, I always knew” and accepted her. There was not much reconciling with Ada, who had walloped George daily, nor with the siblings who mocked the delicate-featured boy whose voice did not break and whose body grew more physically feminine with adolescence. He prayed nightly to awake as a girl. At 16, George joined the merchant navy. After attempting suicide on shore leave in Los Angeles, he voluntarily entered a mental hospital in Ormskirk in Lancashire, where he pleaded with doctors to be made more masculine, was treated with hormones and electric shock therapy, and eventually fled to London. When he first dressed as a woman there, he knew he would become one, although not yet how. On a Paris holiday he fell in with performers who helped him to become a dancer under the name of Tony April, at Le Carrousel nightclub, famous for its transgender cabaret. Its fabulous headliner, Coccinelle, recommended him to the Casablanca clinic of the pioneering surgeon Georges Burou, who took seven hours over a gender realignment operation and greeted the new April Ashley with “Bonjour, Mademoiselle” when she awoke. Returning to Britain and registered officially as a woman, Ashley was a natural at modelling, and also took a bit part in the film The Road to Hong Kong, starring Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. But in 1961 a friend sold Ashley’s secret to the Sunday People for a fiver, and her name was dropped from the movie’s credits when it came out the following year. Her agency cancelled all bookings and told her she wouldn’t work in the UK again, and indeed when she applied for jobs the response was usually: “We don’t want people like you.” Ashley eventually found hostess work in nightclubs on the Costa del Sol in Spain, including at the Jacaranda in Marbella, owned by her suitor Arthur Corbett, due to become the next Lord Rowallan, whose compulsion to cross-dressing was ending his first marriage in divorce. They wed in Gibraltar in 1963, but Ashley ran off a fortnight later with the heir to the Duque del Infantado. In 1966 she demanded maintenance: Corbett counterfiled to have the marriage annulled on the grounds that Ashley was not a woman. The trial lasted three weeks, proceedings took three years, and in 1970 the judge ruled that Ashley “was at all times a male” and there could be no marriage between two men, a precedent that lasted for more than 30 years. Ashley subsequently had a breakdown, but recovered enough to open, with a friend, Desmond Morgan, a Knightsbridge restaurant, April and Desmond’s, where she greeted, and drank with, celebrity customers. That frenetic life likely provoked a heart attack that sent Ashley into exile in Hay-on-Wye in 1975, where attempts to get off the dole through catering and waitressing work foundered when some of her fellow employees discovered her past and made her feel a freak. In 1986 she followed a new husband, Jeffrey West, to San Diego in California; the marriage ended in 1990, but she stayed on there, spending some time working for Greenpeace before finding a job in a craft gallery. Her Californian co-workers didn’t ask who she was; her story anyway was becoming less exotic. Ashley yearned to return to the UK, and in 2005 successfully appealed to the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, once a fellow renter in a London boarding house, to grant her a birth certificate recognising her as female; by then the UK had introduced the Gender Recognition Act 2004. For lack of national insurance paid, her pension was meagre and she lived in straitened circumstances to the end – despite some fees, firmly demanded, from public appearances. Liverpool made her a citizen of honour in 2015, and an exhibition, Portrait of a Lady, ran for 12 months in the same year at the Museum of Liverpool before transferring to London. Her appearance when collecting her MBE for services to transgender equality at Buckingham Palace in 2012 could not have been more regal. Ashley’s second tell-all memoir, The First Lady, came out in 2006, but it turned out that large sections of it had been taken directly from her first autobiography, April Ashley’s Odyssey, written in 1982 with Duncan Fallowell. When the publisher of the first book spotted the lifts, the second one had to be withdrawn. So she never got the hoped-for biopic, although she did coach the actor Eddie Redmayne in sexy voice timbre and deportment for the film The Danish Girl (2015).

1/19/2022,"The office was a strange and alienating terrain for me when I arrived in it at 23. I had dropped out of university years before, expecting something to happen to me that would focus my future and simultaneously bestow a great windfall. It hadn’t. But I was sick of being poor and I had a boyfriend I wanted to play house with. When a temporary admin contract at a medical institution in Dublin came up, I jumped at it. Immediately, I felt overwhelmed, and self-conscious about my stupid little outfits – pastiches of what professional women wear, which I had cobbled together from Topshop sale racks and charity shops. I was prickly, wary of saying the wrong thing, unable to relax.  Everything changed when my friend, whom I’ll call John, joined the company. He wasn’t a close pal, but we were part of the same social scene in what I still considered to be my “real life”. At first, I was concerned that having him around would expose me and my hokey performance of “office employee”. In fact, it did the opposite. Lunchtimes, which I had previously spent eating yoghurt alone at my desk, became something I looked forward to. We developed a routine, visiting the nearby “fancy burger place” as a Friday treat (where I would order a sad, bread-free beef bowl, meals in my early 20s being largely characterised by a lump of protein eaten smugly while mumbling about carbs). Once, on our break, we went to the pub and ordered frozen margaritas, which turned out to be flamboyant comical things, whipped into excessive domes. We were so pleased with ourselves that I asked a stranger to take a photo. We went on a work hen do together, where everyone wore nurses’ hats and waved grotesquely realistic penis toys. After we left the work crowd, we got a rickshaw down Grafton Street, speechless and wheezing hysterically. I don’t mean to suggest that John splintered us off from the wider office: he was instantly, effortlessly liked by everyone, and working there never seemed to cause him the anxiety it did me. Rather, it was through John that I found office solace. He was an abundantly creative person – playing in several of the best Dublin bands, wearing an appealing lopsided smile and a denim jacket I coveted – but he did not seem affronted by the fact that he also had to work in a job unrelated to his creativity. It changed my perspective: I’d barely produced anything creative at all, but had arrogantly and pre-emptively felt afraid that I never would if I was working in an uninspiring job. I’ve since written a novel, which was published last year. I’m still terrible at being in offices, still worried I’m going to be “found out”. But, in all the years since, I’ve never felt cooler or more part of a gang than when taking advantage of built-up flexitime to clock out at 4.30pm on a Friday and leave with John, denim jackets on, to go to discuss the events of the week. He not only made the office into something that didn’t terrify me, but made me happy and hopeful, too. I’m yet to meet anyone else capable of such sorcery.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Memories of office life: as a temp, I was self-conscious and disillusioned – until John arrived",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/19/memories-of-office-life-as-a-temp-i-was-self-conscious-and-disillusioned-until-john-arrived
1/19/2022,"Las Vegas is a comfortable place to land for pop stars. It’s where you go to bask in the validation of a job well done, to rest on a solid legacy at a point where the future may have become less certain and any tentative steps into it may harm that legacy. It seemed, for a while, a safe harbour for Britney Spears after her troubles (until she said she was made to perform against her will); Lady Gaga and Katy Perry also set up shop in the desert after their imperial phases faded. Adele, whose three-month Caesars Palace residency begins this weekend, has no need for this lucrative safety net – her latest, 30, was the biggest album of 2021 with just six weeks on sale. She’s playing there for practical reasons: she hates touring and wants to be close to her son at home in Los Angeles. But there is also something quietly subversive about her presence, right now, in a place synonymous with light entertainment and celebrating adult milestones. Once known for supplying comfort and artistic consistency (even complacency, perhaps), Adele made one of last year’s most confrontational albums.  Prior to 30, I had listened to Adele’s earlier records out of professional duty, decided they weren’t for me, and moved on; she is my age but felt completely alien from our times. Her third album, 25, made me quite uneasy – here was a young mum, apparently in a solid relationship, revisiting juvenile heartbreak again. Hearing her reanimate that corpse felt to me like another young female artist getting trapped in purgatory – anxiety, whether hers or the label’s, that the public would never let her escape the sadness that made her name. When news broke that she was divorcing, there was an unseemly glee at the album people assumed she would write – a kintsugi masterpiece, flooding her brokenness with that golden voice. Adele may have made some predictable music in the past, but she seldom moves that way in her own life. For the first time, her music followed suit. The album 30 is neither full of recriminations for her ex-husband nor regret; instead Adele is steadfast that she had to leave her marriage because she was unhappy, and she was certain that her commitment to personal happiness would ultimately benefit the whole family – though finding fulfilment isn’t as straightforward as simple emancipation. The album follows a linear journey through her anguish at the pain and confusion it causes their son (My Little Love), and the depression and despair that accompanies her newfound solitude (Cry Your Heart Out). But her self-worth accrues with the album’s run time – and her belief in self-sufficiency. “All you do is complain about decisions you make,” she sings on Woman Like Me. “How can I help lift you if you refuse to activate the life that you truly want?” She’s singing to a lazy new lover who hasn’t met her expectations, but it also feels like a subtle challenge to Adele’s audience to reconsider how they see her – not as a reliable remedy during their own periods of heartache, but as a woman who took a risk to redefine happiness on her terms and forge a healthier relationship to herself – as well as to truly consider their own lives and potential for change. Critics have often justified Adele’s era-defining success by her relatability, but the daring woman on 30 is a provocation; the pop equivalent of Glennon Doyle, the self-help guru whose work made Adele feel “as if I just flew into my body for the very first time”. 30 hit me in a way I would never have expected. Adele’s album titles – 19, 21, 25, 30 – map a direct journey through adulthood with all its attendant milestones. And as New Yorker critic Carrie Battan wrote, her “contemporary take on soul, blues and gospel has been appreciated as a monument to tradition”. 30 derails that linear path of growth and defies tradition in both senses. It is her most idiosyncratic album, still respectfully in touch with those influences, but more playful with them: the wryly processed Motown girl group harmonies on Cry Your Heart Out; the use of voice notes on My Little Love that she has said nod to Tyler, the Creator and Skepta; the boozy looseness of I Drink Wine. She finds greater power in the subtleties of vocal expressiveness than she did in sheer volume – the coy head-in-the-clouds flirtatiousness of All Night Parking, the embarrassed neediness of Can I Get It – though she makes her unparalleled vocal power into a weapon on To Be Loved, making the listener feel the weight of her decision: “Let it be known that I tried,” she bellows, strafing her vocal chords. You wonder whether her quest for greater self-knowledge and fulfilment opened up this potential for experimentation, to venture beyond the bounds of her once-fixed musical identity as she did her roles as a wife and mother. The expansive pleasures of this album also stake a claim for the vitality of adult contemporary music, a once-powerful genre diminished by age-conscious segregation of radio formatting and the commercial assumption that parents and pop fans over the age of 35 have Bublé-steeped mush for brains. The realities of adult life and pop are seen to be incompatible: as I previously wrote about Robyn, the music industry is built on selling the kind of self-belief that only truly comes with age, yet few artists, particularly women, get to mature on their own terms. Even Adele – the century’s biggest commercial success – had to field these concerns. In an interview with Zane Lowe, she recalled a meeting where someone at her label highlighted the importance of making sure 14-year-olds knew who she was. “I’m like, but they’ve all got mums!” Adele said. “If everyone’s making music for the TikTok, who’s making music for my generation, for my peers? I’ll do that job gladly. I’d rather cater to people that are on my level in terms of the time we’ve spent on Earth.” She rejected the idea that 12-year-olds should even listen to 30. “It’s too deep! Thirty- and 40-year-olds are all committing to themselves and doing therapy. That’s my vibe. That’s what I was doing.” Maybe, then, Vegas is the perfect place for Adele to debut this album to the public. In front of the nearly weds and newly divorced merrymakers, here is someone who gambled on her future and won herself back.",Arts/Music,Adele’s divorce album is a slyly subversive fit for a Vegas residency,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/19/adeles-divorce-album-is-a-slyly-subversive-fit-for-a-vegas-residency
1/19/2022,"A lawyer for Britney Spears has threatened legal action against her sister Jamie Lynn, and accused their father of financial misconduct, including the hiring of a private security firm to keep Britney and people close to her under surveillance. A letter written by Britney’s lawyer Mathew Rosengart instructs Jamie Lynn to “cease and desist from referencing Britney derogatorily during your promotional campaign” for her new memoir. “If you fail to do so or defame her, Britney will be forced to consider and take all appropriate legal action.”  The letter states that Jamie Lynn’s memoir contains “misleading or outrageous claims”, and that Britney believed Jamie Lynn had “exploited her for monetary gain”. Britney made the latter allegation previously in a recent Instagram post, saying: “She wants to sell a book at my expense.” Jamie Lynn responded to that earlier statement, claiming: “My book is not about her. I can’t help that I was born a Spears too, and that some of my experiences involve my sister.” She has not responded to the letter, which continues: “Publicly airing false or fantastical grievances is wrong, especially when designed to sell books. It is also potentially unlawful and defamatory.” The letter continues the spat between the sisters, which began after Jamie Lynn was interviewed on Good Morning America and said Britney’s behaviour had historically been “erratic, paranoid and spiralling”. In the book, Jamie Lynn describes an alleged incident at home with Britney during her childhood: “Britney said to me, ‘Baby I’m scared.’ And she took a large knife from the kitchen, pulled me along to my room and locked us both inside. She put the knife in the bedside table drawer and simply repeated, ‘I’m scared.’ ” Regarding this passage, Britney wrote on Twitter: “Jamie Lynn … you’ve stooped to a whole new level of low. I’ve never been around you ever with a knife.” Jamie Lynn discussed the incident further in a podcast interview, saying: “I never felt like she was going to harm me or anything – it just felt weird.” A later Twitter post saw Britney soften her stance, telling Jamie Lynn “just know I love you”, but also accused her of a lack of loyalty and help during the conservatorship that controlled many aspects of Britney’s life, which was terminated in November. Britney has also newly accused Spears’s father Jamie of financial impropriety during his management of the conservatorship. Jamie Spears has attempted to have legal bills generated by the conservatorship hearings paid by Britney. In response, Rosengart made a court filing that states: “The allegations of misconduct against him are specific, credible and serious, ranging from abuse to conflicts of interest, financial mismanagement and corruption of the conservatorship to implicating state and federal criminal law.” The alleged incidents cited in the filing, reported by the New York Times, include the hiring of security firm Black Box for a total of $6m to monitor Britney’s phone and her mother’s, download notes from her therapy sessions despite being forbidden from seeing them, and track the movements of people associated with her via GPS. Elsewhere in the court filing, Jamie Spears is also accused of selling Britney’s childhood home to himself, of charging high expenses for the maintenance of her property – including sending funds to a company owned by Jamie Lynn’s husband – and of approving unusually large legal fees involving dozens of law firms. The allegations made in the court documents reflect findings by an investigator used by Britney’s legal team to examine Jamie Spears’s management of her affairs. Her investigation included an interview with a former Black Box employee. Jamie Spears has not responded to the allegations. The Guardian has contacted his lawyer for comment. In a previous response to allegations of surveillance, his lawyer told the New York Times: “All of his actions were well within the parameters of the authority conferred upon him by the court. His actions were done with the knowledge and consent of Britney, her court-appointed attorney, and/or the court.” Jamie Spears’s request regarding legal fees is expected to be addressed in a court hearing on Wednesday in Los Angeles.",Arts/Music,Britney Spears accuses father of financial misconduct; threatens sister with legal action,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/19/britney-spears-accuses-father-of-financial-misconduct-threatens-sister-with-legal-action
1/19/2022,"Airlines including Emirates, Lufthansa and Air India have cancelled or changed US-bound flights owing to concerns about the deployment of 5G mobile phone technology near airports. The US aviation watchdog has said 5G signals could interfere with radio altimeters, which measure how high a plane is in the sky and are a crucial piece of equipment for pilots, particularly when landing in bad weather.  The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) began updating its guidance on which airports and aircraft models would be affected on Tuesday. Airlines say the Boeing 777 is initially in the spotlight. AT&T and Verizon, the two wireless carriers behind the 5G plans, said they would pause the rollout near key airports, which had been due to take place on Wednesday. But Dubai-based Emirates, the world’s largest operator of 777s, announced on Wednesday it would halt flights to Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Miami, Newark, New Jersey, Orlando, Florida, San Francisco and Seattle over the issue. It said it would continue flights to Los Angeles, New York and Washington. In its announcement, Emirates said the cancellations were due to “operational concerns associated with the planned deployment of 5G mobile network services in the US at certain airports”. Japan’s two major airlines, All Nippon Airways (ANA) and Japan Airlines, said they would curtail Boeing 777 flights. ANA said it was cancelling or changing the aircraft used on some US flights. Air India announced it would cancel flights to Chicago, Newark, New York and San Francisco “due to deployment of the 5G communications” equipment. It said it would try to use other aircraft on US routes. Germany’s Lufthansa said it had cancelled a flight from Frankfurt to Miami and was switching aircraft used on some US services from the Boeing 747-8 to the 747-400. Its subsidiary Austrian Airlines said it would switch from a 777 to a 767 on its Newark service. Korean Air said it had switched away from 777s and 747-8s on six US passenger and cargo flights. Taiwan’s China Airlines said it would reschedule some flights, and Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways said it would deploy different aircraft types if needed. The airlines said they were acting in response to a notice from Boeing that 5G signals could interfere with the radio altimeter on the 777, leading to restrictions.",News/Business,Airlines cancel some US flights over 5G concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/19/airlines-cancel-some-us-flights-over-5g-concerns
1/19/2022,"Kwajo Tweneboa adored his father. They were very similar: they both enjoyed a laugh, had an interest in current affairs and made sacrifices to care for others. Then, in January 2020, Tweneboa watched his father, who suddenly became terminally ill with cancer, die. All the while, cockroaches, mice and flies infested their dilapidated housing association flat on the Eastfields estate in Mitcham, south London. Tweneboa, a 23-year-old student, shared the flat with his two sisters, 24 and 21. He says he asked the housing association, Clarion, to make repairs for more than a year, with little success, before deciding to take further action. Since then, he has become a champion for his neighbours and all those living in similarly squalid conditions, forcing landlords and housing associations to acknowledge their responsibilities and make urgent, necessary repairs.  “I’m willing to take on absolutely everyone and anyone to ensure this issue is spoken about,” he says. “It’s been going on for way too long.” Speaking via a video call, Tweneboa is eloquent and passionate as he lists the appalling conditions his family had to endure after moving into the flat in 2018. He says the pest infestation made home cooking impossible, so the family lived on takeaways. There was mould on walls. In one room, there was no ceiling, just exposed beams and floorboards from the flat above. Cabinets rotted and water poured through light fixtures, which Tweneboa claims were surrounded by asbestos. “I couldn’t even bathe in my own house. I had to go to the gym,” Tweneboa says. Despite repeated appeals to Clarion – Europe’s largest housing association – he says he received little help. (Clarion denies this.) When Clarion did respond, they sent the wrong people to fix the wrong thing. Tweneboa says he complained about the missing ceiling in February 2020, but no one came to fix it until October. “Instead, they sent a roofing team out – it was stupid things like that. They didn’t actually put the ceiling back up until the following year.” Meanwhile, Tweneboa’s father, a former care worker, was undergoing treatment for stage 4 oesophageal cancer. He was diagnosed in November 2018, 10 months after they moved in, and cared for at home by Macmillan nurses. Tweneboa was shocked by his father’s sudden deterioration. “I’ve never experienced anything like that before,” he says. “He would just sleep for days on end. It wiped him out. I believe he deteriorated as quickly as he did as a result of the conditions he was living in.” The nurses struggled to care for Tweneboa’s father due to the dire state of the property. “They were finding it difficult to bathe him in the bathroom, for example, as it had no lights and the tiles were falling apart.” Landlords ignoring their tenants’ requests is an all-too-common practice. In October, the Housing Ombudsman’s report on damp and mould in socially rented properties found evidence of “maladministration” among 56% of the 142 landlords they investigated over a two-year period, rising to 64% for complaint-handling alone. The report said: “This failure rate was often the result of inaction, excessive delays or poor communication.” The roots of Britain’s housing crisis can be traced to Margaret Thatcher’s government and the 1980 Housing Act, which gave council tenants the right to buy their council homes. Councils enticed tenants with the offer of 100% mortgages and generous discounts on the value of their property. Wealthier tenants were often able to transform their homes before selling them or becoming landlords themselves, but this resulted in a drop in the numbers of properties available for those who still required social housing. Today, getting social housing – and having it repaired – can feel like a lottery. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (now the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities) had its budget cut in half in 2010, while austerity has the housing departments of councils short-staffed and unable to respond quickly to complaints. When Thatcher took power in 1979, the average council tenant paid £6.40 in rent a week. When John Major took office in 1992, tenants were forking out £30 a week – a rise of 370%. However, the average pay for full-time manual workers rose by only 189% over the same period, which means the proportion of income spent on rent by those workers had increased by about 62% by 1992. Councils have not replaced the properties they sold and many tenants who remain in social housing feel as if they have been forgotten. The lack of social housing stock also forces many low-income households into the lower end of the private rental market, where they have even fewer rights than social renters, who can usually rent their homes for life. Assured shorthold tenancies allow private landlords to issue no-fault eviction notices without giving a reason, which means some landlords will ignore tenants’ complaints about essential repairs and address them at their own convenience – especially when dealing with low-income tenants who feel they have few options. One of the critical problems with housing in the UK is that many of the buildings are old: 81% were built before 1990, 35% were built before 1945 and 20% were built a century ago. Austerity has compounded this to create the housing misery we see today. The Good Home Inquiry, published by the Centre for Ageing Better in September, found that 4.1m homes do not meet the decent homes standard (DHS), the statutory minimum standard for housing. This states that homes must be free of dangerous hazards, have modern facilities, be in a reasonable state of repair and have effective insulation and heating. Tweneboa’s home fell well short of these criteria. Tweneboa and his sisters had lived with their father since they were children (his mother also lives in London). Before moving to Eastfields, they had spent years in cramped temporary accommodation, unable to afford the cost of a mortgage or the high rents of private accommodation. Once, they were housed in a one-room converted garage. “There was mould growing on to the beds and we had a water [pipe] burst during winter, so we had to call the fire brigade. It was just absolutely horrific.” Tweneboa’s father fought for years to get the family into social housing; Eastfields was the only permanent accommodation offered to the family. Ayear after his father died, Tweneboa took matters into his own hands. In May, he decided to shame the housing association on Twitter, posting a collection of photos showing his family’s living conditions. He wrote: “Clarion Housing has to be one of the worst council housing in London. Since my dad passed away in 2020 they’ve left me in a property which has been described as ‘unliveable’ and when I’ve called to chase a leak which I reported 5 days ago they’ve told me they’re busy.” The tweets went viral, attracting attention from the national press. Tweneboa also started a petition asking Clarion’s chief executive, Clare Miller, to resign. The petition noted how Miller was paid £400,000 a year while “her tenants live in conditions not fit for animals”. The negative press appeared to spur Clarion into action. They repaired Tweneboa’s flat over the summer and issued an apology stating: “We acknowledge the inconvenience the repairs issues at this property have caused and apologise if Mr Tweneboa feels we haven’t provided the service expected from us.” “That sentence really annoyed me,” Tweneboa says. “So I contacted every single house on my estate and, within half an hour, I had constant messages or photos, complaints of everyone else suffering with the same disrepair – in some cases, even worse.” Tweneboa says he discovered that some tenants on Eastfields had been complaining about their living conditions for decades. A family of six complained they were contending with dampness so severe that mushrooms had sprouted all over their home. Other tenants reported collapsed ceilings, broken fire doors – which allowed strangers to trespass, use drugs and relieve themselves in the communal hallways – and hordes of mice scurrying around inside the walls. Tweneboa posted a thread on Twitter with more photographs and descriptions of the disrepair, forcing Clarion to issue a further response: “We recognise that some repairs and pest control measures have taken too long over the last six months and apologise to all affected residents.” The housing association also promised “a continuing planned investment programme”, which included decorating and updates to appliances. After he called out Clarion online, Tweneboa’s inbox blew up. “I’ve had hundreds, if not thousands, of people contact me from across the country,” he says. One family said they had to wash their children on their high-rise balcony during the height of winter because their shower had broken. Clarion allegedly told the mother of the family to use the toilet and the kitchen sink; her son ended up in hospital due to the cold conditions. A woman in Westminster claimed her water heating pipe exploded at 4am, flooding her flat and leaving her with burns. Tweneboa also heard from tenants struggling with mould, damp, disrepair, infestation and neglect. “We’ve been suffering,” he says. “This should be a national scandal, but it’s been kept under wraps and ignored for so long. I’ve realised that this has been going on for absolutely decades, longer than I’ve been alive, but people in power just don’t care.” In 2017, 72 people died in the Grenfell Tower fire. The disaster exposed the high level of neglect for the country’s poorest households and highlighted how slow landlords can be to react to serious complaints. Concerns had been raised about the materials used in the building’s external cladding years before the Kensington high-rise went up in flames. The catastrophe inspired books, documentaries and films and galvanised housing campaigners. Four years later, though, not much has changed for the UK’s poorest tenants. Tweneboa says he thought that, after Grenfell, councils would be more conscientious about housing safety. “But what I learned is that people’s lives are still being put at risk. I have no doubt that people have died as a result of living in social housing.” His intuitions are correct. In 2019, E3G, a climate change thinktank, reported that 17,000 people died due to cold households in the winter of 2017/18 – the sixth-worst figure in a study of 30 European countries. Studies have shown that poor living conditions can have a profound impact on people’s physical and mental wellbeing. Since its public shaming, Clarion claims to have knocked on the door of “each and every home” in Eastfields to inform residents of its plans for the area. It has also opened a new on-site office and announced a £1.3bn regeneration project in Merton, including the Eastfields estate. A Clarion spokesperson says: “Clarion Housing Group and Merton council have a joint vision for the future of the Eastfields estate, which is a community that benefits from regeneration and brings forward hundreds of new affordable homes. “Since Mr Tweneboa’s case first came to light last year, we have invested significantly into existing homes, apologised to residents where our service fell short and published a comprehensive lessons learned report. Our focus now is on the future and working with the council, our residents and key partners to create a community that everyone living in Eastfields will feel proud to call home.” After everything Tweneboa has been through, does he feel as if he has made a difference? “My community definitely values me because of how outspoken I’ve been. But Clarion only put out their statements when I get the media involved. They’ve never been willing to talk to me directly. They don’t care. [But] I don’t need to feel valued by them; the only thing I care about is people who are suffering under the same conditions as I did.” On the Eastfields estate, Clarion says it has completed more than 600 repairs since June 2021, as well as kitchen and bathroom replacements at 24 properties, as part of their investment programme. Although his father never got to see these achievements, Tweneboa knows he would be pleased to see him helping so many people. “He would be proud and he would say: ‘Keep going and keep doing it until they listen.’”",News/Society,‘I’m willing to take on absolutely everyone!’ Kwajo Tweneboa on fighting for Britain’s poorest tenants,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/19/im-willing-to-take-on-absolutely-everyone-kwajo-tweneboa-on-fighting-for-britains-poorest-tenants
