3/16/2022,"A man has been charged with three counts of murder following a fatal house fire in a boarding house in Newtown in New South Wales on Tuesday. The 45-year-old man was also charged with one count of destroying or damaging property by fire or explosive. Richard Hotoran, from Newtown, went to Surry Hills police station at about 7.40pm on Tuesday where he was interviewed by homicide squad detectives and subsequently charged. He was refused bail and was due to appear in court later on Wednesday. Emergency services were called to the fire at the corner of Probert and Albemarle streets in Newtown at about 1am on Tuesday after reports of a loud explosion. Three people confirmed dead are yet to be identified, and police hold fears for a fourth person who is still missing. Eight residents fled the intense fire with three of them taken to hospital, including a long-term resident identified only by his first name, Ronnie, who was in a critical condition after leaping from a window to escape the flames. The 80-year-old man then had a heart attack on his way to hospital, where he remained in a critical condition. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Neighbour Bernie Godzik has known Ronnie for years and describes him as a loved member of the community, a local at the pub and a man who is always laughing. Godzik said another of his friends dragged Ronnie away from the blaze after he jumped, saying he was covered in cuts and blood and his jeans were on fire. “People will be angry about this,” Godzik said. “For this to happen to an 80-year-old, it’s not right.” The neighbour said every year for Ronnie’s birthday the community would do a “whip around” and buy him a present. In recent years that included a new bed for his room in the boarding house and a wallet full of money. “We all care of him,” Godzik said.

3/16/2022,"At least 18 private jets or helicopters linked to Russia have been struck from the Isle of Man’s aircraft register, as the offshore authorities moved to enforce sanctions brought by the EU and UK. Three aircraft have been removed in the last week, including a helicopter and private jets believed to be ultimately owned by Roman Abramovich, Oleg Tinkov – an oligarch not subject to direct sanctions – and Dmitry Mazepin. The cancellations ensure that the aircraft cannot be flown in UK or EU airspace, even though they are not directly owned or registered by individuals sanctioned for their connections to Russia. A spokesperson for the Isle of Man government said that aircraft with a connection to Russia were being “reviewed as a matter of utmost priority”. He said that the Isle of Man aircraft registry – favoured by the super-rich to avoid taxes liable elsewhere – had acted “proactively and robustly” since the imposition of sanctions, working in cooperation with the UK’s Department for Transport. He said the registry, known as Iomar, was “duty bound to act appropriately in accordance with such measures, and under these circumstances an aircraft would be de-registered following required legal and regulatory processes.” Iomar has so far cancelled the registration of 18 aircraft and said it was likely that further deregistrations may follow in a “rapidly evolving situation”. Among the latest were an Airbus helicopter which has previously been tracked landing on the Chelsea owner Abramovich’s Solaris yacht, and a Gulfstream G650 aircraft owned by Mazepin. Mazepin, a billionaire owner of mineral fertiliser company Uralchem, was added to the EU sanctions list last week, along with his son, the ex-F1 driver Nikita Mazepin. Mazepin senior was described in the sanctions document as “a member of the closest circle of Vladimir Putin”. A Dassault Falcon business jet linked to Oleg Tinkov, the founder of Russian online bank Tinkoff, has also been deregistered. Tinkov is not sanctioned, but his wealth is estimated by Forbes to have fallen more than $5bn in a month since the invasion as the rouble collapsed. Russian-owned and operated planes have been banned from UK airspace. Last week a private plane with suspected links was impounded at Farnborough airport on the orders of the transport secretary, Grant Shapps.",News/World news,Isle Of Man authorities deregister Russian-linked private aircraft ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/isle-of-man-authorities-deregister-russian-linked-private-aircraft
3/16/2022,"More than 100,000 Britons have expressed interest in hosting Ukrainian refugees, amid concerns that the new government scheme could lead to exploitation of vulnerable women and children. The figure was released by the government less than 24 hours after Homes for Ukraine programme was launched to take in those fleeing Russia’s invasion, most of whom are women and children. Under the scheme, UK householders will be given initial “light touch” checks and paid £350 a month if they take in named individuals. Lauren Agnew, human trafficking policy expert at Christian Action, Research and Education, said the scheme is “well motivated” but could lead to exploitation. “With large numbers of applications needing to be processed quickly, red flags could be missed in the vetting of potential hosts. “Recent statistics from the National Crime Agency estimate there are at least 6,000-8,000 modern slavery offenders in the UK. We can be certain that some of this number will be seeing the Homes for Ukraine scheme as an opportunity to turn a profit,” she said. Local authorities will also receive £10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services - with more for children of school age, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said. Local government leaders have warned that the quick turnaround of arrivals could mean that accommodation is unsafe and relationships between sponsors and new arrivals break down. James Jamieson, the chair of the Local Government Association, said: “With new arrivals possibly arriving as early as Sunday, councils are facing a very tight timeframe to make appropriate safety checks on accommodation being offered. “There is a limit to what can be achieved by councils in such a short space … Despite good intentions, there is a risk that some accommodation offered may not meet safety expectations when inspected by councils or sponsorships may break down.” Before the scheme launched, only Ukrainians with family links to the UK could apply for visas that would give them access to work and benefits. But on Monday, the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, announced that sponsors could bring any Ukrainian to the UK to live in their home for a minimum of six months. A Ukrainian family could become the first to be rehoused in Britain after they were offered a place at a six-bedroom mansion in Yorkshire. Lillia and Vitalii Kucher, along with their daughters Victoria, 14, and Ilona, six, have sought accommodation at Sabrina and Tony O’Brien’s home in Driffield near Hull, the Daily Mail reported. They are looking to get to the UK in the next week after fleeing to Moldova when Russia invaded their homeland last month. Almost 3 million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion, with more displaced within the country as cities are shelled. Concerns that Ukrainians fleeing the war are facing exploitation were also raised in the House of Commons on Tuesday by Theresa May. The former prime minister said: “This is happening in Poland. It’s happening in other countries where Ukrainian refugees are fleeing to. “It’s a sad reflection on human nature that the very point where these women and children are fleeing Ukraine for their safety to find refuge elsewhere, the criminal gangs have moved in to make money from the trafficking of what they consider to be yet another commodity, that is human beings, and they are attempting to make money out of this human distress and vulnerability.” The UK has faced criticism over its policy towards those fleeing the violence in Ukraine, with applicants required to apply for a visa. Boris Johnson has defended the scheme, insisting last week the country was “absolutely determined to be as generous as we possibly can be”. The government has previously come under fire for its response to the evacuation of Kabul after the Taliban takeover in August last year. Some 15,000 people were taken out of the Afghan capital but the rushed nature of the evacuation meant thousands of Afghans who had worked with the UK were left behind. The government has been under domestic pressure to do more to prevent migrants crossing the Channel on small boats, putting themselves at risk in the busy shipping lane. Reports claimed that 300 migrants crossed the Channel by boat on Tuesday, according to journalists monitoring activity off the Kent coast.",News/World news,"UK refugee scheme could lead to exploitation of Ukrainians, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/uk-refugee-scheme-could-lead-to-exploitation-of-ukrainians-say-experts
3/16/2022,"British Iranian dual nationals Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori could be freed and allowed to return to London within days under a deal in which the UK agrees to repay a £400m debt and release an Iranian prisoner. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has for months been at her parent’s home in Tehran awaiting news of whether she would have to serve a further one-year sentence in Iran handed down on top of the five years she had already served. Iranian diplomatic sources leaked news of the possible deal on Tuesday saying the UK had agreed to pay the debt, something London would only be doing if it had the agreement of the US to do so. The UK has previously said the debt payment could not be made because of sanctions on Iranian state banks. On Sunday, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was unexpectedly given her British and Iranian passports – a preliminary to her likely release. She has also been summoned to see officials at the ministry of intelligence and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps to discuss her future behaviour. Confirmation of the return of her passport was published by Zaghari Ratcliffe’s MP, Tulip Siddiq. A UK government negotiating team is in Tehran. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, said discussions were delicate, adding it was best “you should say as little as possible unless and until the thing is actually concluded.” Ashoori, it is understood, has also been told to make preparations for his likely release from Evin jail, Tehran. It is likely they will be flown out of Iran via Oman. One source said: “This is the closest we have come to her release in six years, but I do not expect to see either of them at Heathrow in the next 24 hours.” The deal could yet unravel as it has in the past if there is a last-minute hitch – either over the talks on the Iran nuclear deal in Vienna or if the US insists other detainees are released. The Vienna talks should see a swath of US sanctions lifted on Iranian state bodies and industries, in return for Iran coming back into compliance with the constraints placed on its civil nuclear activities, including uranium enrichment. Russia threw a last minute curve ball at the Vienna talks on 5 March by demanding written guarantees that any Iran-Russian trade unleashed by the lifting of US sanctions must be exempted from the US sanctions imposed on Russia as a result of the invasion of Ukraine. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, met the Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian in Moscow on Tuesday to discuss Russia’s demands, and appeared to have backed down. He claimed to have received guarantees, but they do not appear to be the broad exemptions Russia has been seeking. He added it was a lie that Russia had ever wanted to delay the nuclear agreement. His remarks led oil prices to fall. Some officials said it is possible the two British-Iranian dual nationals will be released prior to the conclusion of the nuclear deal since the key bilateral Iranian demand of Britain has been the repayment of the £400m debt that has been outstanding since the 1970s. The UK, in court cases and letters to the Ratcliffe family, have acknowledged it owes the debt. Both Ashooori, sentenced to 10 years, and Zaghari-Ratcliffe, have always protested their innocence, with their families claiming they were being used as state hostages, or pawns in Iran’s demand for the repayment of the debt. The deal appears to exclude Morad Tahbaz, a British-American businessman born in Hammersmith, London, who also has Iranian citizenship. A conservationist, Tahbaz was sentenced along with eight others to 10 years in jail in November 2019 for “contacts with the US enemy government”. The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has tweeted frequently in support of his innocence, an acknowledgement that he is a British consular case. His family was in contact with both the foreign office and the US State Department on Tuesday, trying to find out if he had been excluded from any prisoner swap. A member of the Tahbaz family said: “I am asking the question ‘Why is it the only British-born UK citizen held hostage in Iran is being left out and abandoned? How is it that the UK is accepting Iran’s rejection of his nationality based on his birth?” She added: “In January 2021 the then foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, had previously sought our consent to get a sanctions waiver from the US for payment of the Chieftain tank funds in exchange for release of Ashoori and Zaghari-Ratcliffe whilst Morad would get a partial furlough and then be treated as a USA problem to secure his complete release. Morad in a message from jail refused such a deal and so did the USA since they expected the UK to work as hard for him for his permanent release.” The Tabhaz family say they had closely followed Foreign Office advice not to go public about his plight, but now felt betrayed since they had found out from the media what was happening behind their backs.",News/News,Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori could be free in days,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/15/zaghari-ratcliffe-and-anoosheh-ashoori-could-be-free-in-days
3/16/2022,"Good morning. Talks between Russia and Ukraine have resumed. Russian forces are reported to have taken patients and medical staff of a hospital in Mariupol as hostages, as the conflict enters day 21 and more than three million people have fled the country. State Emergency Service units in some of the hardest-hit flood areas in northern New South Wales had warned in 2020 that the closure of regional offices would reduce their ability to respond to natural disasters. A dozen SES units wrote to the commissioner warning that a restructure “threaten[ed] the continued existence of units … and the future of the service”. Unions warned at the time the measure would cost jobs and hurt services, but the government justified it on the basis it would “reduce back-office costs and focus expenditure where it is needed most”. In the complaint, the SES units said the removal of regional offices had “pushed significant new administrative burdens on to volunteers, frustrating and demoralising dedicated members”. Almost half of all massacres of Aboriginal people were carried out by police and other government forces, according to final findings of the Colonial Frontier Massacres Digital Map Project. The report showed that conflict was widespread and most massacres were planned in a deliberate attempt to eradicate Aboriginal people. The final update of the project added a further 113 massacre sites, but many more attempts did not make the map because fewer than six people died. Historians say attempts at the mass killing of Aboriginal people were still being made as recently as 1981, when a mass poisoning killed two and left many in hospital in Alice Springs. Kyiv is facing “a difficult and dangerous moment” amid signs Russia was tightening its grip on the Ukrainian capital after airstrikes on civilian buildings killed at least five people and prompted a 35-hour curfew. The Polish, Czech and Slovenian prime ministers were due to arrive in the embattled city on Tuesday in a symbolic show of European solidarity. Talks between Russia and Ukraine have resumed, Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said, after negotiations had taken a “technical pause” on Monday. There are reports that Russian soldiers have taken medical and patients from a hospital in Mariupol as hostages. And a woman who protested the war during a live news programme on Russian state TV has been fined 30,000 roubles (AU$390) by a Russian court after she was found guilty of flouting protest legislation. Environment groups say the Morrison government plan to remove the need for federal environmental approval for developments in some regions is a “step towards an industry free-for-all” rather than an effort to protect nature. The government announced it would use a little-known law to create regional plans, which could exempt some developments – such as mining or agriculture – from needing federal environmental approval.

3/16/2022,"In White Torture, a book about the horror of solitary confinement in Iranian jails, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe recalled her first night in jail following her arrest at Tehran airport on 3 April 2016. “The first night of detention I did not know where I was,” she explained. “I don’t remember what happened or what I did. I was shocked. I didn’t know why it had happened. No one gave me any explanations. Nobody told me why they were treating me like that, why they took my child away from me or where I was. The interrogation began.” The sense of bewilderment and injustice – and of wanting to interrogate her interrogators – has followed Zaghari-Ratcliffe in each of the 2,172 days that have passed since then; some of it in solitary confinement, often in a state of torment and unbearable psychological stress. Along with her fellow British-Iranian prisoner, a 68-year-old retired businessman Anoosheh Ashoori, that torment might just be about to end. It’s not a given – after six years of twists and turns, nothing can be taken for granted. But the developments on Tuesday were undoubtedly significant. During her ordeal, Zaghari-Ratcliffe felt suicidal , often only brought back from the brink by the campaigns that their extraordinary families have mounted in the UK to keep their names in lights, and expose what they regard as a systematic Iranian practice of cynical state hostage-taking designed to secure political ends. From her description of her first month in a cell in detention at Kerman detention centre, southern Iran, it is easy to understandwhy she felt so desperate. “The area of the quarantine cell was about two by one metres,” she wrote. “Inside the cell was a half-wall with a squash toilet on the floor behind it. Next to it was a sink and a trash can. The room had a fan. There was no natural light. There was a powerful light bulb in the middle of the cell that never went out. “My heart palpitated so hard that when I put my head on the blanket it was as if it would explode. I knew day from night by the light coming in from the sides of the fan blades on the window. At nights I couldn’t sleep and only by the sound of sparrows did I know it was dawn.” After a month of interrogation she was finally allowed to see her daughter. “After the meeting I felt awful. Gabriella had changed. She had teethed. She didn’t recognise me. I didn’t recognise her either when I first saw her. When they came in she was in my father’s arms. I was so weak that I could not stand. She clung to me and didn’t move at all for a few minutes.” She had been told her family had abandoned her as a spy. After a month she was moved from Kerman to Evin prison in Tehran. She had a cellmate and was able to see her mother and daughter once a week, but she never imagined her ordeal would last six years. In February 2017 she wrote a letter to Gabriella, or Gisou as is her Farsi name. “My sweet girl, the sound of your laughter, has been ringing in my ears these past months, becoming one with me. Caressing your hair and listening to your velvety voice have been denied to me for many days become months. As those moments piled up, they have turned into giant black clouds pouring every night and every day like monsoon rain, constantly with no power in me to stop. Did they not hear long nightly whimpers of a mother? – those who issued a guilty verdict and to achieve their ends accused me, reproached me and locked me up in solitary confinement?” But her story gradually became one of more than personal loss. Her husband, Richard, decided to overrule Foreign Office advice and go public about his wife’s arrest. He believed they felt he could not grasp the bigger picture of Middle East politics. Ironically by the end he was an astute reader not just of the British media and diplomacy but of Iranian politics too. He said: ”Instrumentally, who knows what works? But I do know that Nazanin is sitting in her prison cell knowing that people are shouting for her and rooting for her, and that’s profoundly important. So I do know I’m helping her to know she’s not alone.” Ratcliffe made three discoveries; first that her fate was linked to an unpaid £400m debt dating back to a deal to sell 1,500 tanks to the Shah of Iran; second, she was not alone, but part of an Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps industry of hostage-taking; and finally that Boris Johnson as foreign secretary only responded to public pressure. It was after his mistake at the foreign affairs select committee where he said she had only been in Tehran to train journalists that Johnson started briefing that he had found a way to pay the debt. The briefing was premature - there was a Whitehall and transatlantic dimension that had not been cleared. In all his dealings with the Foreign Office, it has been the debt and the UK’s reasons for not paying it that officials and ministers have been most reluctant to discuss. On leaving his post, the former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt took the bold step of saying British Iranian dual nationals would not be released until the money was paid. Ratcliffe’s lawyers sent repeated lengthy letters setting out how the debt could be paid and not face US sanctions. Ministers simply refused to discuss the issue. If the deal does go through – and there are many pitfalls ahead – it represents a remarkable change. It had only been last Friday that Ratcliffe and his advisers, Redress, had sent a long legal letter to the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, demanding the Foreign Office describe his wife openly as a state hostage, as opposed to a detainee. The 15-page letter complained that the Foreign Office’s handling had allowed her detention to become not merely a bargaining chip to regain the £400m debt, but also collateral in the grand bargain over the terms on which the US would lift sanctions on Iran and return to the deal signed in 2015 limiting Iran’s nuclear programme. But the Foreign Office only tells the families of the hostages so much, and did not reveal a British negotiating team was already on its way to Tehran. Looking at the sequence of events it was unlikely that the UK team would have travelled unless the UK had agreed to pay the debt, even if the conditions were for discussion, as well as its relationship to the completion of the nuclear deal. But to her astonishment on Sunday, the ministry returned her British and Iranian passports, the start of her release process. It was the first time she had seen them since their confiscation in April 2016 The Foreign Office swore her to secrecy. Early on Tuesday a well placed Iranian foreign correspondent revealed the debt had finally been paid. The Foreign Office was concerned by the leak, fearing it showed Iran might be using their possible release as last-minute leverage to secure better terms on the lifting of sanctions in Vienna. The nuclear deal was virtually complete, but some feared dangling the liberation of two high profile British detainees might be a way to extract some final concessions from the British or the Americans. In her letter five years ago to her daughter she wrote: “There will come a day when we will throw away all these bitter and old memories, all that are decayable and only keep the lessons we learned from them. You, I and your father will never succumb to this hurricane of fate. The love we share knows no boundaries and walls. It is our life. There will come a day that we will be able to live fresh all the days of our lives.” Perhaps that day is finally coming.",News/News,Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s six years of bewilderment and injustice,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/15/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffes-six-years-of-bewilderment-and-injustice
3/16/2022,"It is good practice for companies to change their auditors once in a while, and the same principle should probably apply to countries and operators of national lotteries. So yes, one can instinctively welcome the Gambling Commission’s surprise decision to ditch Camelot, which has had the national lottery gig since it was launched 28 years ago. No company should become part of the furniture. What, though, has Czech group Allwyn, the new “preferred applicant”, promised to do differently to Camelot? It’s impossible to tell because the commission, at this stage, insists on cloaking its decision-making process in secrecy. Assurances that the process was “fair, open and robust” don’t count for much unless the outside world can see the methodology. The clincher, we assume, was Allwyn’s idea that it can raise £38bn for good causes over the decade of the next licence which, even allowing for inflation and greater prosperity among punters over the years, would compare favourably against the £45bn-ish that Camelot has managed since 1994. But the £38bn figure is not yet endorsed by the commission, which merely referenced “increased contributions”. Camelot will probably also have promised to up its game in terms of sums raised, as the other bidders will have done. So how did the commission set about judging the credibility of the various boasts? We’re not told. A degree of paranoia on the part of commission is probably forgivable since the contract is lucrative for the holder (Camelot, owned by a Canadian pension fund, has made after-tax profits of £78m in each of the last two years) and legal challenges are possible, and perhaps likely. Even so, it’s hard to think of another piece of semi-public procurement with such minimal levels of disclosure at the point a victor is declared. Allwyn has assembled an impressive cast of business and fundraising grandees, led by 2012 Olympics guru Sir Keith Mills, but the company obviously had to clear higher hurdles to win. The commission should loosen up and remember that lottery players are interested in who’s running the show and why. More transparency needed. Every fresh sanction helps but, let’s be clear, the UK’s ban on exports to Russia of “high-end luxury goods” (precise definition not yet clear) is not a gamechanger. The Department for Business’s last monthly update of the size of UK-Russian trade already contained some small numbers in the grand scheme of UK exports. Total UK exports to Russia in the 12 months to the end of September 2021 amounted to £4.3bn, of which £2.6bn was goods. Cars, the biggest contributor at £386m, will be covered, one assumes, but pharmaceutical products, next in the list, probably won’t be. Either way, a focused hit to trade in the UK’s 26th largest export market, accounting for just 0.7% of total UK exports, is bearable. Similarly, the imposition of an additional 35% tariffs on £900m-worth of imports also needs to be seen in context. Total UK imports of Russian goods in the same 12-month period amounted to £10.8bn. None of which is to play down the effect of tariffs if they are replicated among all G7 countries, especially those with bigger export volumes to Russia. There will be an impact. But, from a strictly UK perspective, asset freezes on oligarchs remain the main event. UK firms with operations in Russia are a different matter and here, commendably, comes another departure. Imperial Brands, the JPS and Gauloises cigarette firm, will seek “an orderly transfer of our business”, which probably translates as giving it away to a local operator who will look after the 1,000 employees. There’s no surprise in that decision since Imperial had already suspended manufacturing and fellow FTSE 100 member British American Tobacco, after a rapid rethink last week, concluded that a full exit was the only credible course.

JTI, the main subsidiary of Japan Tobacco, and US group PMI, which sells Marlboro and other brands outside the US, are still in a halfway house.

3/16/2022,"My father, Peter Ackers, who has died aged 97, was a civil engineer and an expert in hydraulics. He worked on projects all over the world, involving hydropower, tidal energy, coastal protection, reservoir spillways and other hydraulic structures. Born in the Liverpool suburb of Bootle, he was the son of Mary (nee Jones), a supervisor in a quilt-making factory, and Peter Ackers, a carpenter/joiner in the Mersey docks. He attended Bootle grammar school, where he excelled at physics and mathematics. He studied civil engineering at the City & Guilds College (part of Imperial College), London. The course was compressed into two years because of the second world war, and its scope broadened to include air-frame design, useful for the war effort. He was also an air-raid warden, reporting to a unit behind the Royal Albert Hall, and suffered a near miss when a shell hit the road next to him, breaking the glass in a nearby telephone box. After graduating in 1944, he worked at the National Physical Laboratory and the Bristol Aeroplane Company, where he was involved in designing the Bristol Freighter and Brabazon aircraft. In 1946 he moved into civil engineering, with periods in local government in Preston and Stoke-on-Trent, during which time he obtained an MSc (Eng) from Imperial College. In 1956 he moved to the Hydraulics Research Station (now HR Wallingford), rising to the position of assistant director, and became active in the International Association for Hydraulic Research. In 1972 he started working as a consultant with Binnie & Partners and became a visiting professor at Imperial College. He worked on protection against typhoon wave attack on the sea defences at High Island reservoir, Hong Kong; the design of the Greater Cairo wastewater system; innovative siphon spillways at reservoirs in Hong Kong; a rough-cut unlined rock tunnel to supply water beneath the Andes to Lima; and many other projects. He was also an expert adviser to the committee that investigated the feasibility of a Severn estuary tidal energy scheme, which could have provided 7% of the UK’s electricity generation as “green” and predictable energy. The committee, led by Sir Hermann Bondi, reported to the government in 1981. It was a huge disappointment to him that this project, much larger but similar to the successful tidal energy barrage on the estuary of the Rance river in France, was not taken up. He also wrote or contributed to about 70 technical papers and publications, and retired in 1994. Then he worked on improving his French – he enjoyed travelling, especially on cultural guided tours and river cruises – and raised money for the RNLI. He donated his library of technical books to a university in Ethiopia. In 1949 he married Margaret McGeagh, who was born in Bootle on the same day as him. She died in 2015. He is survived by their three children, Sheila, David and me, by four grandsons and by two great-grandchildren.",News/Technology,Peter Ackers obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/15/peter-ackers-obituary
3/16/2022,"Tony Blair believes that the next fortnight could be the last chance for the west to agree a peace deal with Russia to end the Ukraine invasion before the conflict escalates. The former prime minister said that Nato should not rule out intervening in the war but has also called on the west to not give up on the prospect of negotiating a peace deal with Vladimir Putin. Moscow and Ukraine officials held a further round of talks on Tuesday in an attempt to end the conflict which has entered its 20th day. In a lengthy essay on his thinktank’s website, Blair believes that the next two weeks may be the last chance to agree a negotiated settlement “before the assault on Kyiv becomes worse, the Ukrainian people become hostile to any negotiation, or Putin faces a binary choice between “‘double down’ or retreat”. He wrote: “And we should not underestimate the real economic price the world will pay for continued conflict with steep rises in fuel prices, food prices, global trade and inflation, as ever hitting the poorest in our society the worst ...” The former Labour prime minister also believes that it is a mistake for Nato to be as specific as it has been about not getting involved in the conflict. He argued that the future status of Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine could be part of successfully brokering a peace deal with the Russian president. Blair – who served as prime minister between 1997 and 2007 and took the decision for the UK to join the 2003 Iraq war – said that he understands and accepts there is not any political support for direct military engagement by Nato but the west should be “clear-eyed about what Putin is doing.” He wrote: “He is using our correct desire not to provoke escalation alongside his willingness to escalate as a bargaining chip against us. “When he is threatening Nato, even stoking fears of nuclear conflict, in pursuit of his attempt to topple by force a peaceful nation’s democratically elected president and wage war on its people, there is something incongruous about our repeated reassurance to him that we will not react with force. “I accept the reasoning behind our stance. But suppose he uses chemical weapons or a tactical nuclear weapon, or tries to destroy Kyiv as he did Aleppo in Syria, without any regard to the loss of civilian life – is it sensible to tell him in advance that whatever he does militarily, we will rule out any form of military response? “Maybe that is our position and maybe that is the right position, but continually signalling it, and removing doubt in his mind, is a strange tactic.”",News/World news,Tony Blair: west has fortnight to help end war in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/tony-blair-west-has-fortnight-to-help-end-war-in-ukraine
3/16/2022,"Russian oligarchs will no longer have access to baubles such as the cars, artworks and designer handbags sold by British companies, after the government blocked exports worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Last year, UK firms in total sold £2.6bn worth of goods to Russia, the biggest slice of which was cars, at around £400m, as wealthy Russians splashed out on prestigious marques such as Aston Martin, Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Many luxury goods companies have already voluntarily stopped doing business in Russia but the ban would “make sure oligarchs and other members of the elite are deprived of access to luxury goods”, the government said. Helen Brocklebank, the chief executive of Walpole, the trade body for the UK luxury sector, said it was “fully supportive” of the sanctions. “All of our members have immediately complied with the sanctions imposed and are working to support local employees in any way they can,” she said of its 250 members which include Bentley, Burberry and Rolls-Royce. The clampdown on Kremlin-linked wealth has thrown the spotlight on Britain’s art market amid fears Russian oligarchs could use legal loopholes to evade sanctions. Sotheby’s said it had already stopped the import and export of artefacts to and from Russia and its office in Moscow was currently closed. The company, which does not conduct auctions in Russia, promised to “rigorously follow the sanctions and regulations”. Christie’s, which has also shut its office in Moscow to the public, said it had taken the decision to cancel its Russian art sales which were due to take place this summer in London. Cars are the UK’s number one export to Russia with annual sales of £386m – or nearly 15% of all exports to the country - according to the most recent data from the Department for International Trade. The other big markets are for medicine, machinery and power generators, the data showed. Despite its prominence in the export data, Russia is relatively small market for UK car plants – it is thought that the UK exports fewer than 10,000 cars a year to Russia out of an annual production on 860,000 in 2021. However, there are Aston Martin, Bentley and Rolls-Royce showrooms in Moscow and St Petersburg, as well as dealers stocking cars from BMW-owned Mini. Although overall sales volumes in Russia are low, the expensive cars being sold there have high profit margins, said David Bailey, professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham. The export ban was “another hit” for British carmakers who, he said, are already facing difficulties due to ongoing shortages of semiconductor computer chips. Bailey said British brands such as Range Rover sold well in Russia in part because of the “state of the roads”. It is “partly about the premium and luxury nature of British cars but also their off-road capabilities”, he said. “Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) pulled out basically because they thought was the right thing to do,” said Bailey, who added that the collapse of the rouble would also make it difficult for companies to price expensive cars. “It’s not good news for the likes of Jaguar Land Rover, Bentley and Rolls-Royce.” JLR and Aston Martin have already paused deliveries to Russia. A spokesperson for Bentley Motors said it too had also stopped the export of cars destined for Russia “until further notice”. The scale of spending on luxury goods in Russia is not of the same magnitude as in countries such as China and the US. The annual spend on cars, jewellery and designer fashion is put at about £7bn – a figure split between the domestic market and high-end stores of London and Dubai – by analysts at the investment bank Jefferies. Earlier this month Burberry, one of Britain’s most famous exports, temporarily closed its three outlets in Russia which includes a shop in Moscow’s famous Red Square. The UK government is yet to provide a detailed breakdown of the luxury goods covered by its export ban but analysts think it will be similar to the EU’s, which includes clothing, accessories, precious stones and works of art. It is not clear if Scotch whisky will be on it too; while famously vodka drinkers, Russians are also partial to a malt, with 42m bottles, worth nearly £28m, exported there last year.

3/16/2022,"My colleague and friend Eglé Laufer, who has died aged 96, was a psychoanalyst who worked for more than 50 years at the Brent Centre for Young People (BCYP) in north west London, where she was president. Eglé began providing psychoanalytic therapies to adolescents at BYCP when it was created by her and her husband, Moe (Moses) Laufer, in 1967. She remained completely dedicated to psychoanalysis, and even into her 90s was participating in two weekly clinic meetings at the centre. Over the years Eglé also carried out important research into adolescent breakdown that identified the importance of having dedicated spaces, such as BCYP, to consider teenage development. With Moe she suggested that mental breakdowns among teenagers were often related to a rejection of the adolescent body. She was born in Vienna to Sigrid, an Austrian child psychiatrist, and her husband, Imre Vajda, a Hungarian economist. Her parents divorced in the early 1930s when Eglé was still young, and when her mother married ​Edwin Pribram, an aircraft engineer, she moved to London at the age of seven with her new family. Eglé graduated in mathematics and physics at King’s College London, but then decided to become a psychoanalyst, and did her training at the Institute of Psychoanalysis during the 50s. First she worked with young women in the obstetrics department at University College hospital, and then became a training analyst at the British Psychoanalytical Society. In 1947 she had married Sigurd Zienau, a theoretical physicist, with whom she had a child, Nick. They divorced in 1960, and she married Moe in 1965. Two years later, with a group of psychoanalysts led by Moe, Eglé founded the BYCP to provide free psychotherapy and to focus on adolescent breakdown – at a time when mainstream psychoanalysis was disregarding the treatment of adolescents. Together, Eglé and Moe created Adolescent Exploratory Therapy (AET), a tailored version of traditional psychoanalytic psychotherapy for vulnerable, hard-to-engage young people. With her work at the BCYP, which provided AET for 374 young people last year alone, Eglé and Moe’s reputation spread further afield, and and similar services for adolescents have been created in Geneva, Milan and the US. Moe died in 2006. Eglé is survived by Nick and by four grandchildren, Jenny, Eva, Emilie and Raphael.",News/Society,Eglé Laufer obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/15/egle-laufer-obituary
3/16/2022,"Ed Sheeran was targeted with a “concerted plan” to secure his interest in a songwriter who later accused him of copying one of his songs, the high court has been told. The former management company for Sami Chokri, a grime artist who performs under the name Sami Switch, allegedly made a “huge effort” to bring the 2015 song Oh Why to Sheeran’s notice, the copyright trial heard on Tuesday. One company director claimed that they felt cheated and upset by Sheeran’s alleged “blatant copying” of the song in his 2017 hit Shape Of You. Chokri and his co-writer, Ross O’Donoghue, claimed that a central “Oh I” hook in Sheeran’s song was “strikingly similar” to an “Oh why” in their own composition. Sheeran and his co-authors, producer Steven McCutcheon and Snow Patrol’s John McDaid, deny copying and say they do not remember hearing Oh Why before the legal fight. Lawyers for Chokri and O’Donoghue have alleged there is “clear, cogent and compelling” evidence that Oh Why was widely available and sent to a number of Sheeran’s close friends and colleagues. In written evidence, David May, managing director of Artists and Company (A&C), a firm that used to manage Chokri, said that when Oh Why was being promoted the outfit had “a concerted plan to target Ed Sheeran in the hope of engaging his interest in Sami’s work … We did not target any other artist in the same way.” He added: “We felt that, if Ed Sheeran could see Sami’s work, he would recognise his talent. We saw this as a real possibility because of the connections that we had, and Sami had, to his circle.” May said people targeted in 2015 included late SBTV founder Jamal Edwards, Jake Roche of the band Rixton and senior people at Sheeran’s publisher. In written evidence, Roche said he never listened to Oh Why, while Edwards had said he did not remember listening to the track. Timothy Bowen, an A&C director, said that after hearing Shape Of You in 2017 “we were surprised by what we thought was a blatant copying”. He said: “We were upset that Ed Sheeran had not asked for clearance to include the relevant part of Oh Why into Shape Of You. Having made a huge effort to bring Oh Why to Ed’s notice, the next thing we heard was a part of Oh Why appearing on Ed’s song, Shape Of You, without any acknowledgment or request for permission.” He also claimed Sheeran’s publishing representatives gave “short shrift and refused to engage with us at all”. Earlier in the trial, Chokri disagreed with a suggestion by Ian Mill QC, representing the Shape Of You co-writers, that his management firm had “singularly failed“ to develop his career after the release of his EP, Solace, in June 2015. Sheeran has said he does not recall anyone sending Oh Why to him “in any way” before he wrote Shape Of You. Mill previously said that Chokri and O’Donoghue’s claim that Sheeran had “access” to their work was “at best, paper thin” and there was “clear evidence” that at the time Shape Of You was written its creators had not heard Oh Why. The court has previously heard that PRS for Music has suspended certain payments to Sheeran and his co-writers for the performances or broadcasts of Shape of You. The three co-authors launched legal proceedings in May 2018, asking the High Court to declare they had not infringed Chokri and O’Donoghue’s copyright. Chokri and O’Donoghue then issued their own claim for “copyright infringement, damages and an account of profits in relation to the alleged infringement”.

3/16/2022,"There has been a crackle of excitement in Barbados this week, augmented by the news that Saqib Mahmood will make a highly anticipated debut for the visitors when the second Test against West Indies gets under way on Wednesday. England have travelled here more than anywhere else in the Caribbean over the past 20 years, enjoying its beaches and easygoing vibe, and with 10,000 tourists on the island – plus the lifting of restrictions allowing a full house at Kensington Oval – Joe Root’s side should feel very lucky to be here. Not that all this helped three years ago when Jason Holder’s double century, a stirring display of fast bowling led by Kemar Roach, and Roston Chase’s transmogrification into Lance Gibbs, whipped the outnumbered locals in the Greenidge and Haynes Stand into a frenzy with a 381-run win from which a 2-1 series victory followed. Both sides were beaten by the pitch in Antigua last week and the series remains 0-0. But here, having placed his hand on a bare surface in the search for clues, Root wondered whether more carry is likely and perhaps more deterioration. Jack Leach will note that this is where Jomel Warrican picks up wickets at 25 runs apiece for Barbados, even if his fellow left-armer, Veerasammy Permaul, is the incumbent West Indies spinner. West Indies (possible): Brathwaite (c), Campbell, Brooks, Bonner, Blackwood, Holder, Da Silva (wk), Joseph, Roach, Permaul, Permaul, Seales  England: Lees, Crawley, Root (c), Lawrence, Stokes, Bairstow, Foakes (wk), Woakes, Overton, Leach, Mahmood  England have espoused a new era dawning on tour but with one win in their past 15 Tests, a change in the narrative still hinges on positive results not just positive declarations. The path to 20 wickets is complicated by Mark Wood’s elbow injury, the knock-on being Mahmood’s elevation – cap number 702 for England – and no Ollie Robinson amid caution over the back spasms that ruled him out last week. The way Root spoke about Mahmood before naming the XI on Tuesday already hinted at Saqib getting a go. Lancashire’s 25-year-old right-armer has only one first-class five-wicket haul to date but, with this coming through a fine burst of reverse swing during last year’s Roses match at Old Trafford, before a starring role in last summer’s one-day international series against Pakistan, the excitement here is understandable. “He’s very mature for a guy who hasn’t played a huge amount of international cricket,” said Root. “He’s been very impressive, he’s got a slightly different trajectory and will give us a point of difference. Clearly he has good control, especially if the ball moves with reverse swing. It’s a great option to have up our sleeve.” In some ways Mahmood had to play here if the benefits of leaving Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad at home are to be truly felt. Robinson’s absence will continue the questions over his conditioning for the rigours of Test cricket, the issue first flaring up in Hobart in January and leaving England a bowler down. The resulting reticence now means another chance for Chris Woakes and Craig Overton. Woakes is the father of the house in this squad at the age of 33 and plenty has been asked of him by England this winter. There is an abundance of goodwill behind a hard-working and unpretentious cricketer who excels at home but struggles away; perhaps inspiration during this latest chance will come from the surroundings at Kensington Oval. This can be found at every turn when players gambol down the stairs of the beautiful art deco Garfield Sobers pavilion that sits in the corner of the ground and looks like the bridge of one of cruise ships in Bridgetown harbour. “Iconic,” was Root’s assessment, before sharing a desire to experience his first Test win here at the third attempt. The bulk of England’s top six enjoyed time in the middle last week but a new kind of challenge awaits Alex Lees in his second outing at the top of the order. Even when dismissed in identical fashion by the same bowler in the County Championship, a batter may wait weeks or even months away before a reunion. Test cricket offers no such respite and Roach, having seen the three-card trick of outswingers followed by the straight ball work for both lbws, is back on his home ground here. “That would be lovely [if Roach gets Lees again],” said Kraigg Brathwaite, the West Indies captain who similarly hails from the island and hinted at an unchanged XI. “Kemar has been remarkable for West Indies over the years; I look forward to him leading the way here and bringing that energy.” Overcome the early threat of the hard new ball and batters on both sides should enjoy this surface, however. And even if some prefer bowlers to have the upper hand in Test cricket, visiting spectators will do well not to enjoy their time on the island.",Sport/Sport,Saqib Mahmood gets Test chance as England look to attack West Indies,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/15/saqib-mahmood-gets-test-chance-as-england-look-to-attack-west-indies
3/16/2022,"Spain’s Nuclear Safety Council (CSN) has appealed for people to be on the lookout for a soil-testing kit containing radioactive material that was stolen from a van in the Madrid region. In a statement released on Tuesday, the CSN said it had been notified of the theft of the bright yellow Troxler density and moisture gauge, which was taken after the van’s rear door was forced open in the town of Humanes, 25km south of the capital. The council said the equipment contained Caesium-137 and Americium-241/Beryllium, adding the two radioactive sources are classified as category four on the one-to-five scale established by the International Atomic Energy Agency, on which five is the least dangerous category. “Category four is classed as ‘unlikely to be dangerous to people’ because, given its low radioactivity, it does not pose radiological risks as long as it is kept closed and intact,” the statement said. “The radioactive sources are located in the [kit’s] interior, where they are protected and encapsulated. They could, however, pose a risk if the kit is opened or damaged, resulting in the loss of the sources’ protection.” The CSN released pictures and a description of the Troxler gauge. The box-shaped yellow kit has a metal handle, a glass screen with a keyboard and a metallic tube where the radioactive materials are housed. The equipment is kept in a yellow transport case that carries a radiation symbol and warning. “Anyone who finds the equipment must avoid handling it and should immediately inform the authorities, the police, or the emergency services,” the statement said.",News/World news,Spain: call for return of stolen kit containing radioactive material,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/spain-call-for-return-of-stolen-kit-containing-radioactive-material
3/16/2022,"The first national project to record mass killings on the Australian frontier has found that around half of all massacres of Aboriginal people were carried out by police and other government forces. Many others were perpetrated by settlers acting with tacit approval of the state. The final findings of the eight-year long Colonial Frontier Massacres Digital Map Project show that conflict was widespread and most massacres were planned, in a deliberate attempt to eradicate Aboriginal people and Aboriginal resistance to the colonisation of the country. Researchers have added 113 sites, mostly from Western Australia and the Northern Territory, in the final stage of the project. There are now 415 sites on the map, each representing a place where six or more people were killed. The most common excuse for a massacre was as a reprisal for the killing a colonist, and the number of people killed was heavily disproportionate. The death of one colonist could result in police-led revenge expeditions that lasted weeks or months. Researchers found that attacks on settlers, while often referred to in historical documents as the reason for a killing, often took place after the alleged “killing of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people, abduction and sexual abuse of women, or livestock’s use of hunting grounds and water”. While numbers should be considered to be indicative rather than exact, the difference in casualties is stark. In an analysis by Guardian Australia based on the data, Aboriginal deaths were estimated to be 27 to 33 times higher than coloniser deaths. Between 11,000 and 14,000 Aboriginal people died, compared with only 399 to 440 colonisers. The tallies of the dead are not the only measure of what took place, according to Dr Bill Pascoe, a digital humanities specialist and key researcher on the project. “We are always using conservative estimates,” Pascoe said. “We want to make sure it can stand up to any kind of criticism that might be thrown at it. We don’t want to be accused of overinflating figures. “Another one of the challenges is objectification. White research objectifies Indigenous people, it’s a big problem, and numbers tend to objectify. So it’s easy just to say 11,000 people [were] killed, and carry on with the next news item … so, one of the main challenges [has been], how can I work against that?” Pascoe said narratives were “one of the most important” parts of the map because they gave a more personal account of events. “[It] helps you think about those people and what they were going through, and some of it is really horrific. Then you add that up, that scale of terror, and for the survivors living after it, and you multiply that by 11,000.” Massacres classified as “opportunity” were the second most common. Most of these attacks were planned, not random clashes, and many had government involvement or were carried out in the knowledge that there would be no formal repercussions. A significant number of massacres took place to “teach the natives a lesson” after the theft of livestock – evidence of the conflict over land, water and resources between settlers and the Aboriginal people they were systematically displacing. Most massacres perpetrated by stockmen and settlers were found in the Northern Territory. Emeritus professor Lyndall Ryan, who led the project, said that stockmen in the NT commonly operated under the orders of big pastoral companies. “Particularly after 1860, it is becoming clear that most of the massacres are being conducted by employees of major companies who are bankrolling these big pastoral leases, or mining leases,” Ryan said. “These companies have more money to arm their employees with good firearms to go out and do their work. It’s not the small selector who’s killing Aboriginal people, it’s these big companies who have experienced overseers, experienced stockmen, to patrol and contain the Aboriginal people.” Massacres after 1890 tended to be carried out over longer periods across broader areas, the researchers found. Ryan described these as “genocidal massacres”. “The code of silence really made it very hard for people to speak. [But] I think a lot of people knew what was going on,” Ryan said. “The newspapers have been an extraordinary source of evidence. What is most interesting about the newspapers is people from northern Australia … would write to the Argus or the Age or [other metropolitan papers] and tell them what was going on. So people in Melbourne knew what was going on. “And the reason why these people from north Queensland will write into the papers in Sydney and Melbourne and Adelaide, is because there were companies based in Melbourne that were bankrolling either mining companies, or pastoral companies in northern Australia. “And so these people who are writing are often employees of those companies. It’s as if they’re reporting to their superiors what is going on.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Researchers said although the project was complete, there was much more work to be done. Pascoe said he hoped the map would continue to be a reliable resource to “inform public debate”. “That’s an important role for academia, generally, to be a reliable source of information that’s been through some sort of rigorous methodology,” he said. “The intention [is] to present a clearer and an accurate picture of what we can be confident of.” The Killing Times is based on data from the Colonial Frontier Massacres Digital Map Project led by Prof Lyndall Ryan at the University of Newcastle’s Centre for the 21st Century Humanities.

3/16/2022,"A black child was subjected by police to a strip search at her London school that involved exposure of intimate body parts, according to an official investigation which found racism was likely to have been an “influencing factor” in the officers’ actions. No appropriate adult was present during the 15-year-old girl’s ordeal, described by a senior local authority figure as “humiliating, traumatising and utterly shocking” and which took place without parental consent and in the knowledge that she was menstruating. Details of her treatment in her secondary school’s medical room have emerged in a child safeguarding review initiated by Hackney council after the incident in December 2020. The child was made to bend over, spread her legs and use her hands to spread her buttocks while coughing, and she is now in therapy and self-harming, according to family members’ statements to the inquiry. The damning report said: “Having considered the context of the incident, the views of those engaged in the review and the impact felt by Child Q and her family, racism (whether deliberate or not) was likely to have been an influencing factor in the decision to undertake a strip search.” The report emphasised the importance of the question of whether the child was treated differently because she was black, adding this line of inquiry had been starkly reflected in several events that took place around the same time. “Significantly, some six months prior, George Floyd was tragically killed in the USA and there were repercussions around the globe, including in the UK,” it said. Police were called by teachers who told the review that they believed she was smelling strongly of cannabis and suspected she was carrying drugs, but none were found during the subsequent search. The school was visited by four officers including two women who carried out the search of the girl – referred to in the report as ‘Child Q’ – while teachers remained outside the room and her mother was not contacted. “Someone walked into the school, where I was supposed to feel safe, took me away from the people who were supposed to protect me and stripped me naked, while on my period,” the girl said in a statement, adding that she did not know if she would “ever feel normal again”. The Metropolitan police on Tuesday said they apologised for what a senior officer described as the child’s “truly regrettable” treatment, which has been the subject of a separate Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation, whose report is nearing completion. But senior members of the local council furiously criticised the force in the wake of the review, which concluded that Child Q should never have been strip searched, and found there was an absence of a “safeguarding-first” approach from many of the professionals involved. One of eight findings includes school staff deferring to the authority of the police on their arrival at school. It added: “They should have been more challenging to the police, seeking clarity about the actions they intended to take.” Anntoinette Bramble, Hackney’s deputy mayor and cabinet member for children’s services, and the mayor of Hackney, Philip Glanville, said: “All aspects of this review have appalled us: the decision by police officers to strip search a child in her school; the lack of challenge by the school toward police; the absence of requirements of police to seek parental consent in the strip search of a child. “But most stark: that racism is likely to have been an ‘influencing factor’ in the decision by police to undertake the strip search.” They added that the child’s ordeal had been exacerbated by the fact the strip search had been carried out at school “a place where the child had an expectation of safety, security and care. Instead, she was let down by those who were meant to protect her.” The child’s mother said in statements provided for the review that her daughter had been searched by the police and was asked to go back into an exam without any teacher asking her about how she felt, knowing what she had just gone through. “Their position in the school is being part of the safeguarding team, but they were not acting as if they were a part of that team. This makes me sick – the fact that my child had to take her sanitary towel off and put the same dirty towel back on because they would not allow her to use the restroom to clean herself.” The child’s maternal aunt said her niece had turned from a “a happy go lucky girl” to a “timid recluse” who hardly spoke to her. She was now so traumatised that she was self-harming and required therapy. In a letter, the aunt added: “The family do not believe that the officers would have treated a Caucasian girl child who was on her monthly periods in the same way.” Those who carried out the review were in agreement, concluding that racism was likely to have been an “influencing factor” in the strip search, and that the child had been subjected to “adultification” bias – where black and global majority children are held to adult standards, but their white peers are less likely to be. In a statement released by the Metropolitan police, the force identified the girl as a 15-year-old and said that the search had been conducted after her bag and outer clothing had already been searched by staff at the school prior to police arrival. The search took place in the same part of London where the Met apologised in January and paid compensation to an academic for “sexist, derogatory and unacceptable language” used by officers about her when she was strip searched.",News/UK news,"Racism cited as factor in police strip search of girl, 15, at London school",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/15/black-girl-racism-police-strip-search-london-school-hackney
3/16/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has acknowledged that Ukraine will not become a Nato member, in a significant concession on a day when Kyiv was pounded by Russian shells and missiles and the invading force tightened its grip on the capital. At least five people were killed in the latest artillery barrage on Kyiv, prompting its city hall to impose a 35-hour curfew from Tuesday night amid further signs that the focus of the Russian campaign has shifted to the destruction of residential areas and civilian infrastructure. Zelenskiy made his remarks about Nato while addressing leaders from the new Joint Expeditionary Force, a UK-led initiative bringing together 10 north Atlantic countries to create a capability for responding rapidly to crises. “It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of Nato; we understand this,” the Ukrainian president said. “For years we heard about the apparently open door, but have already also heard that we will not enter there, and these are truths and must be acknowledged.” One of Vladimir Putin’s demands before unleashing his offensive on Ukraine was that its membership of Nato should be ruled out indefinitely. However, the size of the invasion force Putin amassed and his own justifications for the attack, have been widely seen as evidence he would have settled for nothing less than regime change and Russia’s unchallenged dominance of its smaller neighbour. The White House announced on Tuesday that Joe Biden would travel to Europe next week to attend an extraordinary Nato summit on 24 March “to discuss ongoing deterrence and defence efforts” in the face of the Russian invasion, and also join a scheduled European Council summit. There were reports Biden would also visit eastern Europe on the same trip. As the Polish, Czech and Slovenian prime ministers arrived by train in the embattled city on Tuesday in a symbolic show of European solidarity, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said it faced “a difficult and dangerous moment”. After repeated bombardments and almost encircled by Russian forces, about half of Kyiv’s 3.5 million pre-war residents have fled, officials have said, with many of those who remain spending their nights sheltering in underground stations. Klitschko promised it would not surrender. “The capital is the heart of Ukraine, and it will be defended,” he said. “Kyiv, which is currently the symbol and the forward operating base of Europe’s freedom and security, will not be given up by us.” The series of four heavy pre-dawn explosions rocked residential districts of Kyiv on Tuesday, hours before talks between Ukraine and Russia were set to resume. “Streets have been turned into a mush of steel and concrete,” said the head of the capital region, Oleksiy Kuleba. “People have been hiding for weeks in basements.” One strike on Kyiv hit a 16-storey housing block, where fire raged and smoke billowed from the shattered skeleton of the building, as emergency services and stunned locals navigated an obstacle course of glass, metal and other debris littering the road. Residents in Kyiv’s northern Podil district, which is close to Russian positions, told the Guardian that they had heard an increase in shelling between the two sides over the past two days. On Tuesday morning Daria Kloichko came home to her flat in north Kyiv city, which was all but destroyed by a rocket at 5am. Kloichko’s flat was strewn with glass and little was salvageable. There was hardly a flat in the block untouched by the attack. A refugee from the 2014 war in eastern Ukraine against Russian proxy forces, she and her husband hugged and cried as they took pictures off the wall - the only objects which somehow survived the attack. “Luckily, we weren’t here,” Kloichko said with a tear-stained face. Another man, Andriy, who lived in the block but declined to give his surname, said the blast somehow jammed the door to his child’s bedroom and he had to break the door down. In the east, the airport in Dnipro also sustained massive damage overnight, while Russian forces launched more than 60 strikes on Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, according to the regional administration chief, Oleh Sinehubov. The strikes hit the city’s historic centre, including the main marketplace. The UN said that nearly 1.4 million children – almost one every second – had left Ukraine since the invasion began on 24 February. According to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), 3,000,381 people have now fled Russia’s onslaught in what NGOs have called Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war. The UNHCR expects the refugee total to reach 4 million. The number of people displaced within Ukraine is estimated at 1.85 million, the UN said last week, warning that number could rise to nearly 7 million in coming months. Ukraine was “fighting for life”, Zelenskiy said. “We are fighting against tanks, planes and mortars that Russia is using to destroy us. But Russia is also destroying itself. Every shot against Ukraine, this is a step that Russia takes to destroy itself, to self-isolate … everybody leaves Russia now, all who can think.” He warned that Russia’s “war machine” would inevitably target more western countries if it was not stopped by coordinated international action. “We can stop Russia,” he said. “We can stop the killing of people. Else they will also come to you.” Civilian evacuations from some of Ukraine’s hardest-hit cities continued on Tuesday. More than 100 buses carrying several thousand civilians left the besieged city of Sumy in north-east Ukraine in a “safe passage” operation, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. Authorities in the devastated southern port of Mariupol said 2,000 civilian vehicles had also left the city using a 260km (160-mile) “humanitarian corridor” to the Ukraine-held city of Zaporizhzhia. Another 2,000 cars were waiting to leave Mariupol which has been under heavy bombardment for more than two weeks and is largely without power, heating or water. But Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said a convoy with supplies for Mariupol was stuck outside the city. Russian forces were also reported to have taken hostage patients and medical staff at one of the city’s hospitals. Deputy mayor Sergei Orlov said Russian troops had “captured our biggest hospital ... We received information there are 400 people there.” Peace talks between the two sides resumed on Tuesday, meanwhile, with Zelenskiy sounding cautiously optimistic. The Russians had “begun to understand they will not achieve anything by war”, he said, adding that Monday’s round was “pretty good … but let’s see. They will continue.” While previous talks focused on humanitarian issues, the latest aim to achieve a ceasefire, secure Russian troop withdrawals and establish security guarantees for Ukraine, Kyiv has said. The Russian delegate, Leonid Slutsky, suggested draft agreements may not be far off. Russia again claimed on Tuesday, without evidence, that US advisers in Ukraine were helping Kyiv develop biological and nuclear weapons. The secretary of Russia’s security council, Nikolai Patrushev, said foreign consultants in Ukraine represented “a new threat” to Russia’s security and were potentially raising the risk of nuclear war. The US has categorically denied Russian accusations that Washington was operating biowarfare labs in Ukraine, calling the claims “laughable” and suggesting Moscow may be laying the groundwork to use a chemical or biological weapon itself.",News/World news,"Ukraine will not join Nato, says Zelenskiy, as shelling of Kyiv continues",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/kyiv-facing-dangerous-moment-amid-signs-of-russias-tightening-grip
3/16/2022,"Twenty years ago, in the wake of the September 11 terror attacks, the CIA established an international torture programme “rendering” people to secret detention facilities around the world. The full horror of what took place in these black sites is still emerging. We already know of mock executions and sexual violence; of a detainee waterboarded 83 times in a month; of a man dying during an interrogation and another of hypothermia after being left almost naked on a bare concrete floor – on top of the regular use of pain, humiliation and sleep deprivation. This week, we learned that Ammar al-Baluchi suffered brain damage when he was repeatedly slammed against a plywood wall by trainee interrogators using him as a teaching prop. They queued up to hit his head so that the instructor “could certify them on their ability to use the technique”. The details emerged in a damning report written by the CIA’s own inspector general in 2008, but only now released following a court filing. The “war on terror” became an end that was used to justify any means – but never openly. Torture was rebranded as “enhanced interrogation techniques”. Interrogators sought assurances that a detainee would “remain in isolation and incommunicado for the remainder of his life” before they started work. The programme was pointless as well as brutal. The inspector general noted that the detainee lied to make the torture stop – in line with the 2014 Senate intelligence committee report that found that interrogations frequently produced false testimony (while non-coercive methods elicited useful information). At least 26 of 119 detainees were wrongly held in the first place. Mr Baluchi now faces the death penalty as one of five men at Guantanamo Bay charged with participation in the September 11 plot. The case has been in pre-trial hearings for 10 years, largely due to disputes over the admissibility of testimony obtained after torture. Last week, another Guantanamo detainee – Mohammad Ahmad al-Qahtani, who was suspected of planning to join the plot – was repatriated to Saudi Arabia for mental health treatment. The US dropped plans to try him after concluding he had been tortured at the facility. Despite our growing knowledge, we are still very far from a full acknowledgement of what took place – let alone accountability for it. The supreme court recently blocked two psychologists who designed the programme from being called in a case in Poland, where one of the black sites was located. The 2014 Senate report has never been released in full, though there are now renewed calls for its publication. In the UK, parliament’s intelligence and security committee produced damning reports on British involvement in kidnap and torture in 2018, but the government refused to launch a judge-led inquiry into UK complicity in the programme. On Tuesday, the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism issued a scathing report on the failure to address the atrocities. “Not a single man who was rendered across borders, tortured, arbitrarily detained, separated from family has received an adequate remedy,” Fionnuala Ní Aoláin said. “Many who were returned home continue to live with long-term social and psychological trauma. No one was held accountable for systematic practices of torture and rendition.” This is not only about an injustice to individuals. The rapporteur suggests that the refusal to acknowledge what happened has helped create an environment in which there appears to be impunity for states conducting mass secret detention. An honest reckoning would help to debunk the dangerous myth that torture works and claims that national security requires unfettered powers used in secrecy. It is an essential part of ensuring such crimes are not committed again.",Opinion/Opinion,"The Guardian view on CIA torture, two decades on: we need the truth | Editorial",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/15/the-guardian-view-on-cia-torture-two-decades-on-we-need-the-truth
3/16/2022,"Justice delayed, they say, is justice denied. After a decade of underfunding and two years of the pandemic, courts in England and Wales are grinding to a halt. Dominic Raab, the lord chancellor, thinks there’s no quick fix for the criminal legal aid sector. Mr Raab claimed instead that he would take his time to get things right. The evidence suggests that he is getting things wrong. The backlog in crown courts, which hear the most serious cases, now stands at more than 59,000 cases, up on both before and since the onset of Covid-19. These include rape and sexual offence cases – in which the moving or rescheduling of trials at the last minute causes needless distress. Not only is the backlog lengthening, but the law is taking longer to run its course. As the average wait between crime and verdict in crown courts increases, so does the probability that a case collapses as victims drop out. Prior to the pandemic, defendants waiting to plead their innocence or victims desperate for their day in court could expect it to take a year and two months to see justice done. It’s now almost two years. Mr Raab says that he wants “swifter justice”. But his words are belied by his actions. He has managed to secure only enough Treasury cash to reduce the backlog to 53,000 cases by March 2025, a tally still higher than before the pandemic. Even this modest target looks unachievable thanks to a decade of running down the criminal courts system. About a quarter of junior barristers have left criminal practice in the past five years along with nearly half of all silks. The system is in such disarray that in almost 200 cases between July and September last year, a barrister could not be found for either prosecution or defence. Little surprise that during this period the number of trials postponed was 29% more than the number of trials completed. Matters came to a head this week when criminal barristers in England and Wales voted overwhelmingly to take industrial action. Mr Raab suddenly put out his response to last November’s independent review into criminal legal aid with a pay increase for barristers. While the extra cash is welcome, it’s too little, too late. The Criminal Bar Association thinks its members might get £100 a week extra, which might sway some barristers but probably not enough to stop the planned disruption. Mr Raab’s offer also contained a mechanism to undercut lawyers’ fees. Legal practitioners have waited nearly four years since an independent review into criminal legal aid was first committed to by ministers to get this deal. That the new funding won’t be implemented until the autumn only adds insult to injury. Last month, the lord chief justice – the most senior judge in England and Wales – made a rare public plea for Mr Raab to value the courts. “They must be properly funded in a way that leaves behind the notion that they are no more than an ordinary public service,” said Lord Burnett. Sadly, Mr Raab shows no sign of sharing this admirable sentiment.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Dominic Raab’s courts plan: making a bad situation worse | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/15/the-guardian-view-on-dominic-raabs-courts-plan-making-a-bad-situation-worse
3/16/2022,"Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of “going cap in hand from dictator to dictator,” as the prime minister prepares to fly to Saudi Arabia to seek alternatives to Russian oil supplies. Johnson has a personal relationship with the Saudi leader, Mohammed bin Salman, and government sources suggest he could help persuade the Saudis to increase oil production. The prime minister defended the trip on Tuesday, saying he had to build a coalition of countries to help the west reduce its dependence on Vladimir Putin, likening the Russian leader to a drug dealer who had got the west hooked on his hydrocarbons. Johnson said: “It’s vital, if we are going to stand up to Putin’s bullying, if we are going to avoid being blackmailed by Putin in the way that so many western countries sadly have been, we have got to get ourselves off Russian hydrocarbons.” The investment minister, Gerald Grimstone, will join the trip in an attempt to secure more investment in green technology in the UK. But concern in Britain and elsewhere about the Saudis’ record on human rights has intensified after Riyadh executed 81 men last weekend. Prince Mohammed is believed by US intelligence to have ordered the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Starmer stopped short of calling for Johnson to cancel his trip, which will also take in the UAE, but warned against replacing a long-term dependence on Russian oil, with a reliance on the Saudis. “Obviously there’s a real energy crisis in terms of the cost at the moment, so anything that brings the cost down now is a step in the right direction, whatever it is,” the Labour leader said. “But going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is not an energy strategy”. He accused the government of a short term, “slapdash” approach to tackling the energy crisis. “There’s a pattern here which is short term, in the heat of the moment, slapdash. And that’s what happened in Afghanistan in August. The government was too slow to act; it was only in the heat of the moment it started acting, and then we all saw the consequences in August. “It’s the same with refugees here, in terms of slow, behind the curve, in the heat of the moment – and in terms of energy, which is a shot term, slapdash approach instead of a long-term strategy.” Starmer said instead of pursuing more supplies from Saudi Arabia, Johnson could bring down energy prices by implementing Labour’s plan to levy a windfall tax on oil producers. “Oil and gas companies in the North Sea have made more profit than they expected because of the global price. In their own words, they say we’ve got more money than we know what to do with: so tax that, use that to reduce your energy bills,” he said. Saudi Arabia is part of the Opec+ oil producers’ deal, of which Russia is also a member. It has so far been reluctant to increase production since the invasion of Ukraine led to rocketing prices. Johnson announced last week that the UK would end the import of Russian oil by the end of this year, and was examining the case for ending gas imports. The government is expected to publish a new energy independence plan later this month, including accelerated targets for boosting production of renewables, and a renewed focus on North Sea oil and gas. In an article for the Daily Telegraph, Johnson admitted western countries had made a “terrible mistake” by letting Putin “get away” with annexing Crimea in 2014 and allowing themselves to become more dependent on Russian energy. However, he told Britons that divesting from Russian power would be “painful” and that the financial help offered by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to help with rising bills this year could not be afforded for long. Sunak is expected to take limited measures to tackle the cost of living crisis in his spring statement next week, potentially including a cut to fuel duty. Last month the chancellor announced measures to limit the impact of energy price rises, including a £150 council tax rebate for properties in band A to D and a £200 reduction in household bills, to be clawed back over five years. But energy prices have surged higher since Russia invaded Ukraine, exacerbating the impact of price rises in other areas, and raising the spectre of inflation remaining high for much of the year.",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson going ‘from dictator to dictator’ for oil, says Starmer",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/15/boris-johnson-going-from-dictator-to-dictator-for-oil-says-starmer
3/16/2022,"When the national lottery was launched in 1994, via a TV spectacular watched by more than a third of the population, the famous advertising slogan promised: “It could be you.” It won’t be Camelot though, at least not from 2024. During its tenure of nearly three decades as the lottery’s operator, Camelot outlasted five prime ministers, fought off challenges from the likes of Sir Richard Branson and navigated the rise of the internet and the smartphone. Now, barring a successful judicial review by Canadian-owned Camelot, which now has a 10-day “cooling-off” period to consider its next move, the torch will be passed on. The fourth ever battle for the lucrative licence ended in defeat to Czech-owned Allwyn, which also fended off competition from media tycoon Richard Desmond and Sisal, an Italian firm whose bid was complicated when it was bought for £1.6bn, midway through the competition, by Paddy Power owner Flutter. The big question is what Allwyn’s victory means for consumers, for the good causes that the lottery funds, for Camelot and its 1,000 staff in Watford, and for the new stewards of a game played by nearly 10 million people in the UK. Ultimately owned by the Czech billionaire Karel Komárek, Allwyn already runs lotteries in the Czech Republic, Greece, Cyprus, Italy, and Austria. To boost its efforts to add the UK to the stable, Allwyn hired an all-star cast of business luminaries. Leading the charge was Sir Keith Mills, whose Midas touch moments include inventing the Air Miles and Nectar Points loyalty schemes, as well as running London’s successful bid to host the 2012 Olympics. He was joined by former Sainsbury’s boss Justin King, who chairs Allwyn UK and worked with Mills on the delivery of the games. For the time being, the Gambling Commission won’t say what magic dust this duo were able to sprinkle to unseat Camelot. The competition process is shrouded in secrecy, so much so that a scorecard process during which the rivals were marked on categories such as technology and planned returns to good causes, used code names rather than the companies’ real ones. One well-placed source said that only two people knew which codenames applied to which bidder. While the regulator is remaining tight-lipped, the Guardian understands that Allwyn’s pitch outshone Camelot’s in two key areas: returns to good causes and efforts to curb gambling addiction. Camelot has come under pressure several times in recent years, after profits rose faster than returns to good causes, prompting a rebuke from the National Audit Office in 2017. The company stresses that its profits – about £95m in each of the past two years – amount to 1% of ticket sales. It also points to a recent uptick in good cause money, which fell below £1.5bn in the year of the NAO’s rebuke but has been above £1.7bn in each of the past two years, on the back of record ticket sales of £8bn. Its 28-year tenure, Camelot says, has led to the return of £45bn to 660,000 causes in the UK. But Allwyn is understood to have promised to do better than that, pledging money to good causes of more than £30bn over the course of its first 10-year licence. It aims to do this by recapturing the long lost glitz of the old weekly draw, offering more super-national lotteries, in the vein of EuroMillions, where larger jackpots pull in more players. On top of that, it promises a flood of new technology that it hopes can win a back younger audience which has drifted away from thelottery towards online betting and casino games, leading to a £9m decline in regular players since 1994. Its technology offering, via a partnership with Vodafone, will also work in shops, so that people can use their phone to access products such as scratchcards, allowing the high street to share the spoils rather than losing sales to the internet. The licence decision also comes with social responsibility high on the agenda, as the government, spurred by concern about gambling addiction finalises its white paper on regulation. Camelot has come under fire for seeking to ape the casinos rather than beat them, increasingly relying on more high-octane online Instant Win games. Allwyn is thought to have put responsible gambling at the forefront of its tech-heavy pitch, particularly a plan to impose strict controls preventing people from spending unaffordable sums, such as by playing repeatedly late at night. If the historic handover from Camelot does go ahead, it would likely be an existential matter for the incumbent. Its owner, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, is a vast investment fund with nearly £140bn of assets under management. Camelot has been a steady and lucrative investment but its sole raison d’être is to run the UK national lottery. Without that, it is unclear what Camelot is for. Its chair, Sir Nigel Railton, said on Tuesday that he was “incredibly disappointed” by the decision, while the company declared it was considering its options, potentially including a legal challenge. Labour said on Tuesday that the government must satisfy itself that Komarek did not have links to Russia. This seems unlikely to be a problem. Komarek has a gas storage venture with Gazprom in his native Czech Republic but has condemned Putin’s “barbarism” and is working with the Prague government on a plan that would see the asset nationalised. If Camelot can’t overturn the decision , there is at least hope for the 1,000 people who work for it, mostly in Watford. They, the Guardian understands, are likely to be transferred across to the new incumbent.",News/UK news,Why did Camelot lose the UK national lottery licence?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/15/why-did-camelot-lose-the-uk-national-lottery-licence
3/16/2022,"Attempts at the mass killing of Aboriginal people were still being made as recently as 1981, according to a historian who has spent the past four years researching colonial violence in the Northern Territory. Dr Robyn Smith, who has worked on the University of Newcastle’s colonial frontier massacres map project, says she has also found attempts at massacres in the 1930s and 40s. These horrors are not on the map because fewer than six people died – the research team’s strict criterion for inclusion. But Smith says it shows the violence of the frontier did not abate over time. “It says that the NT was still the frontier. Even though they might not have been successful, in a sense, the intention was to kill people,” Smith says. “I think people were under a bit more police scrutiny, so arbitrary shooting expeditions would have been easier to detect, whereas poisoning is far more underhanded.” The 1981 mass poisoning was reported at the time, but remains unsolved. An Aboriginal man and an Aboriginal woman died and 14 others were admitted to hospital, six of them seriously ill, after unwittingly sharing a poisoned bottle of sherry that had been deliberately left on the grounds of the John Flynn memorial church in Alice Springs. Nabbutta Abbott Nabarula, 50, and David Charlie Jagamara, 28, died on 29 March after drinking the wine, which had been poisoned with strychnine. A team of eight police detectives investigated the incident and offered a $20,000 reward, but no one was ever charged. The NT coroner, Denis Barritt, later found the two people had been “murdered by person or persons unknown”. The lack of detailed information about such recent crimes exemplifies the challenges of verifying frontier killings, Smith says. “It’s really, really difficult,” she says. “Unless, as often happens, someone writes about it 20, 30 or 40 years later, when either most of the perpetrators have died or moved away, or they think that the time for arrest and being held accountable has passed.” Smith says she has also identified massacre attempts in the 1930s and 40s. In 1940, Rembarrnga and Ngalkpon men, women and children were deliberately poisoned by a white overseer at Mainoru station, 250km north-east of Katherine, on the Roper River. It was “an act of spite” by the manager, Tom Boddington, for being sacked by his business partners, Smith says. “He poisoned rations and gave them to the Aboriginal stockman and their families. Essentially, he was trying to kill the workforce.” The story that appears in police records and oral histories is that Boddington took over after Mainoru’s manager, Billy Farrer, became ill. Boddington mismanaged the property, the partners fell into dispute and Boddington was sacked. The anthropologist Gillian Cowlishaw recorded an oral history with a Rembarrnga stockman, Bandicoot Robinson, in 1996. “Tom Boddington and I work, work, work there. He was a bad bloke too. He used to shoot, frighten the hell out of all those people,” Robinson told Cowlishaw. “That Tom Boddington had everybody all cleared out. He was hunting everybody out, black fellows and old Billy Farrer too. He didn’t hit me, but he just hate anybody. “Then we went to Katherine, me and Tom Boddington. Before we left, he put all that arsenic, poison. He poisoned the salt, he poisoned the sugar, he poisoned that box full of tea leaf. “Next morning … they boiled up the tea and when they drank the tea, everyone started vomiting. Everyone vomiting, all that thing, tucker, all had poison, sugar, tea leaf and salt. When we got to Katherine, Tom Boddington told me, ‘You know that Mainoru mob, Billy Farrer went back there? I sang them that song. They’re all here at the hospital. Or might be they all dead now’.” Robinson is saying that Boddington claimed he had been “singing” people, a traditional practice used by powerful law men to enact fatal punishment on wrongdoers. Robinson said he later helped police “lay a trap” to arrest Boddington, and was a police witness. “I went to Katherine court. Then we went to Darwin. War was still on. And I told them about everything, that judge in Darwin. And he shot my uncle too, that Tom Boddington. We went to Alice Springs. I met the Supreme Court there too, and I told them straight. They put Tom Boddington straight in the army. He went to New Guinea fighting, that old Tom Boddington. Just disappeared there now, finish. Might be he got shot now!” Katherine police journals of June 1940 record “investigations re sick natives from Mainoru”, the matter of “Farrer v Boddington” and feeding “Witness Bandicoot” over an extended period. Boddington did enlist in the army, but was discharged in 1942. In another case identified by Smith, the Adelaide Chronicle in 1936 recorded the deaths of five Aboriginal people near Port Keats, who had been deliberately poisoned by a white dingo trapper. No charges were laid. “Poison was used a lot. I’ve come across examples of cooks on stations in the VRD [Victoria River district] steeping tobacco in cyanide and then giving it to Aboriginal workers. Also, distributing poisoned damper.” Smith has been able to verify more than a hundred sites in the Northern Territory from 1827 to the 1920s. There is “so much evidence” of massacres, she says, but it has been “disparate”. To see it all in one place on the map is “seriously depressing, when you realise the scale of it”. Smith says Roper River and the VRD were “very violent places”, where she found the most confronting information. “It was so far from the seat of power and authority – and for the NT, that was Adelaide; the vast majority of our massacres happened on the South Australians’ watch – that it was just lawless. “Pastoralists and overland telegraph officers regularly took the law into their own hands. “I’ve got Paddy Cahill’s own hand, in a letter to the South Australian Register, saying that he engaged in a massacre and saying ‘I don’t know how many I shot, I didn’t stop to count them’,” Smith says. “He was made a Protector of Aborigines. “Technically, massacres were not sanctioned but there was tacit approval and certainly police participation. The Northern Territory was a large place, sparsely populated and governed from distant Adelaide. Later, it was governed from more distant Canberra. There were very few police on the ground to protect the nervous settlers and the land they were progressively plundering.” The research team received a vital piece of original evidence, a letter from a pastoralist on Calvert Downs station in the Gulf country, Bob McKracken, to his sister in Melbourne. This letter says to her: ‘You have no idea what it’s like here, we have to throw the lead around’ and then he goes into details of an 1885 massacre in which he participated. That’s a first-hand account,” Smith says. In the letter, McCracken wrote: “Killing odd ones or even twos or threes is no good, they are never missed and nothing but wholesale slaughter will do any good.” “So people did put it in personal correspondence,” Smith says. “But of course, you know what happens? Someone dies, there’s an old shoebox full of letters, and it gets burnt or thrown out, and that evidence is lost. “But in this case, the family historians held on to it and wanted to make sure that the truth was told.” The Killing Times is based on data from the Colonial Frontier Massacres Digital Map Project led by Prof Lyndall Ryan at the University of Newcastle’s Centre for the 21st Century Humanities.

3/16/2022,"The UK sports minister has emphasised the importance of the country’s close ties with Saudi Arabia as concerns about the Gulf Kingdom’s dismal human rights record raise awkward questions as to whether its Public Investment Fund (PIF) should have been allowed to buy Newcastle United. Nigel Huddleston’s comments to the digital, culture, media and sport select committee on Tuesday may have offered Saudi Media, one of several companies reportedly interested in purchasing Chelsea, tacit encouragement. “The UK’s relationship with Saudi Arabia is really important,” said Huddleston, who maintained the decision to allow PIF to purchase Newcastle was made solely by the Premier League and remained independent of a government he said was unafraid to serve as critical friends of their counterparts in Riyadh. “Saudi Arabia is an important partner of the UK in investment, intelligence and culture. We welcome Saudi Arabian investment. Many, many jobs in the UK are dependent on our relationship with the Saudis but we take the opportunity to talk frankly and openly with Saudi Arabia. We can have frank exchanges because of the nature of our relationship.” Nonetheless, Huddleston said the sanctions imposed on Roman Abramovich by the government and Premier League in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Chelsea owner’s ties to Vladimir Putin had raised the moral bar when it comes to takeovers. “There is a need for a far more robust Premier League owners’ and directors’ test,” said Huddleston. “The integrity element of that is something that’s being pushed.” Although he would not divulge any government plans to implement Tracey Crouch’s fan-led review of the game, Huddleston made clear he broadly endorsed it. “We are at a turning point in English football,” he said. “We recognise there are failures in the structure and governance of English football and the fan-led review is pivotally important because it will contain an independent regulator.” Helen MacNamara, the Premier League’s director of policy and corporate affairs, said England’s top-tier clubs did not want a statutory independent regulator and pointed out there had been no owners’ and directors’ test when Abramovich bought Chelsea. “We already have an independent panel, chaired by a QC who oversees our sanctioning regime, and we’re in the process of putting together an independent panel that will support the Premier League board and scrutinise their decision-making on the owners’ and directors’ test,” she said. Huddleston expects Russia to remain a global sporting “pariah” for some time. The country’s football clubs and national teams have been suspended from all competitions by Fifa and Uefa, and Daniil Medvedev, the world No 1 men’s tennis player, is facing exclusion from key tournaments, Wimbledon included. “As long as Russia continues to be a pariah on the world stage, those sanctions will last,” said Huddleston as the court of arbitration for sport upheld Uefa’s ban on Russian teams as it continues to deliberate on the matter. “The reasons these sporting sanctions matter is because Putin loves nothing better than wrapping himself in the flag and putting himself on the world stage. “I think it’s going to be quite a while before we accept Russia back on to the world sporting stage. I think we can manage perfectly well without Russian investment. I don’t think welcoming it at the moment is morally acceptable.” Asked whether Medvedev would be allowed to compete at Wimbledon this year, Huddleston said he was “in discussions” with the All England Club regarding Russian players. “Absolutely no one flying the Russian flag should be allowed or enabled,” he said. “We need assurances they’re not supporters of Vladimir Putin. There are also visa implications.”",Sport/Football,UK sports minister says relationship with Saudi Arabia is ‘really important’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/15/uk-sports-minister-says-relationship-with-saudi-arabia-is-really-important
3/16/2022,"The former leader of the Proud Boys, a violent far-right nationalist group whose members were prominent in the January 6 riot, was found in possession of comprehensive plans to “surveil and storm” government buildings, prosecutors said. Enrique Tarrio, the group’s former chairman who was arrested last week and charged with conspiracy over the deadly attack, had a nine-page document entitled “1776 Returns”, named for the year of American independence, the New York Times reported. The document, mentioned only in general terms in Tarrio’s indictment, contained details of a complex plan for supporters of Donald Trump to invade and occupy at least seven House and Senate office buildings on the afternoon Congress met to certify Joe Biden’s election victory, according to Times sources. Trump has promoted the lie that the election was stolen and incited the attack on Congress as part of a wider effort to have the result overturned. The document features five sections, the Times reported: infiltrate, execution, distract, occupy and sit-in. The plan called for the recruiting of at least 50 Proud Boys and other Trump supporters to enter and occupy each building, “causing trouble” for security personnel who tried to stop them. Once inside, the instructions stated, the activists would be encouraged to chant slogans such as “We the People” and “No Trump, no America”. Supporters unable to gain access to the buildings would be encouraged to distract law enforcement and other authorities by “pulling fire alarms at nearby stores, hotels and museums”. In the days before 6 January, Proud Boys were to undertake reconnaissance of roads near the seven buildings, looking out for roadblocks and other obstacles. Questions remain over the origin of the document and whether Tarrio, 38, shared it with any of the individuals charged alongside him. They are Ethan Nordean, 31, of Auburn, Washington; Joseph Biggs, 38, of Ormond Beach, Florida; Zachary Rehl, 36, of Philadelphia; Charles Donohoe, 34, of Kernersville, North Carolina; and Dominic Pezzola, 44, of Rochester, New York. But its existence lends context to the US justice department’s decision to charge Tarrio with conspiracy, even though he was not in Washington on the day of the riot. According to the indictment, Tarrio “nonetheless continued to direct and encourage the Proud Boys prior to and during the events of 6 January 2021” and later “claimed credit for what had happened on social media and in an encrypted chat room during and after the attack”. Tarrio has denied involvement in planning the riot. His lawyer, Nayib Hassan, declined comment to the Times. On Tuesday, a judge in Miami ordered that Tarrio remain behind bars while awaiting trial, despite his family having collected a $1.25m bond. The judge, Lauren Louis, said evidence “that he’s a danger to the community is unrebutted”, the Miami Herald reported. More than 770 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol riot, at least 30 members of the Proud Boys, court records show. Tarrio, from Miami, recently stood down as chair of the group, after being sentenced last year to five months in prison for burning a Black Lives Matter banner and unlawfully bringing weapons to a Washington protest. He was also exposed last year as a long-time informant for the FBI and local law enforcement agencies.",News/US news,Proud Boys leader had plans to ‘storm’ government buildings on 6 January,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/15/proud-boys-leader-enrique-tarrio-document-january-6
3/16/2022,"1993: the Conservative government of John Major sets up the national lottery. It is franchised to a private operator, Canadian-owned Camelot, the following year. 1994; nearly 22 million people watch the first ever national lottery draw, broadcast via a special primetime TV event hosted by Noel Edmonds. 2001; Camelot retains the franchise after a bitter battle with Sir Richard Branson’s venture, dubbed the People’s Lottery. Branson fails in a claim for £18m in compensation over the process. 2002; after a period of falling sales, the lottery undergoes a major rebranding, with the main draw renamed Lotto. 2007: Camelot wins the franchise for a third time. 2013: Camelot increases the price of a Lotto ticket to £2, the first rise since it began. 2016; the jackpot climbs to a record £66m and is shared by two ticket holders, who win £33m each. 2017: public spending watchdog the National Audit Office criticises Camelot for failing to increase returns to good causes in line with its increase in profits. 2021: the minimum age to play the national lottery rises from 16 to 18, amid a broader government push to reduce problem gambling and concern about increasingly popular “casino-style” Instant Win games. 2022: Allwyn, ultimately owned by Czech billionaire Karel Komárek, becomes the first company to depose Camelot, winning a 10-year licence to run the national lottery from 2024.",News/UK news,Timeline: 28 years of the national lottery under Camelot,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/15/timeline-28-years-of-the-national-lottery-under-camelot
3/16/2022,"Czech entrepreneur Karel Komárek celebrated his birthday on Tuesday in the style befitting a billionaire, winning the right to operate the UK national lottery for 10 years. “The best bday present ever,” he declared, via social media site LinkedIn. The seeds of his timely victory were sown three decades earlier, in the aftermath of Czechoslovakia’s 1989 Velvet Revolution against the collapsing Soviet Union. Komárek, who grew up in a two-bedroom flat in the South Moravian town of Hodonín, was 20 at the time. His father lent him $10,000 and he started his own business, selling industrial parts. That business grew into KKCG, an empire spanning oil and gas, property, technology and lotteries. Entrepreneurial success has given the 53-year-old an estimated £6bn fortune and a jetset lifestyle. Komárek, wife Stepanka and their four children can take advantage of homes in the Czech Republic, Palm Beach, Florida and the ski resort of Verbier, in the Swiss Alps. But as Komárek closed in on the lottery bid, his ties to Russia have come under scrutiny. His oil and gas business has included partnerships with Kremlin-controlled gas firm Gazprom, with which he retains a gas storage joint venture. Komárek reacted quickly, condemning Vladimir Putin’s “barbarism” in an open letter. He is now in talks with the Czech government to nationalise the asset and force Gazprom out. The billionaire is used to confronting troubling business disputes head on. In 2002, Komárek sued Scottish oil company Ramco, after it commissioned a report about him following a commercial row. According to court documents, the report, written by a group of former MI6 spies, “implicated the claimants in corruption and in one instance in murder”. Described in court as being akin to a James Bond plot, the allegations were allegedly passed to several high-ranking members of the Czech and British governments, including the then foreign minister, Robin Cook. The allegations were never tested in court because Ramco did not seek to prove that they were true. The trial collapsed and Komárek said he was “disappointed” that no apology was ever made. A spokesperson said Komárek had been the subject of a “malicious accusation that was quickly proven to be false at the time”. They said that Komárek’s business interests had “expanded across Europe and easily passed rigorous proprietary tests” in every country where it operates.",News/UK news,Karel Komárek profile: the entrepreneur who will run UK national lottery,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/15/karel-komarek-profile-the-entrepreneur-who-now-runs-uk-national-lottery
3/16/2022,"All hail Queen Rachael Blackmore of Cheltenham, who finally got to bask in the warm, long and loud applause of her adoring public a full year after first being crowned. Her repeat victory on board Honeysuckle in this year’s Champion Hurdle meant there was no more popular winner on the opening day of the first Festival since 2020 to open its doors to the public, even if a nasty fall in the next race quickly brought her crashing back to earth. Such is the life of a professional jockey, but her latest big race success was a genuinely heartwarming occasion to be part of. For all her modesty, Blackmore clearly enjoyed the very public acclaim that was so cruelly denied to her by circumstance last year. It was the highlight of a long day. “ARE YOU READY TO ROAR?” the Racing Post’s front page had excitedly enquired of readers and racegoers in a nod to the fabled guttural release that rolls down from the packed grandstand and across the verdant green of the racecourse to greet the start of the opening race at Cheltenham each March. While the answer seemed to be a resounding yes, a false start from the skittish Dysart Dynamo in the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle meant this year’s collective bellow came to a premature end. Although the 70,000 present tried to rally themselves for another visceral outpouring of celebratory joie de vivre when the starter, Robbie Supple, re-released the tapes and the field finally began motoring on their two-mile trek, the moment had passed. Braying drunks. A tidal wave of tweed and mustard corduroy. Ray Parlour skulling pints in the Guinness Village at 10.30am. Slowly but surely, nature is healing. At least you could certainly be forgiven for thinking so given the almost total absence of face masks adorning the tens of thousands of racegoers who converged on a heartwarmingly sunny Cheltenham for day one of this year’s annual National Hunt jamboree. In the racecard the Jockey Club preached caution, good hand hygiene and the avoidance of congregating in “busy areas”. With punters piling six-deep around the parade ring and at the counters of every available bar, it was resolutely ignored. Pride of place on the front cover went to Blackmore and Honeysuckle, the beaming jockey’s arm raised in triumph following her victory on board the Henry de Bromhead-trained mare in last year’s Champion Hurdle. The undisputed star of that particular Festival, when she announced herself to a wider UK audience by booting home six winners in Gloucestershire, it was a delight to see her get her raucous post-race dues this time around. This year the crowds returned in their droves and as the most enthusiastic among them queued patiently outside the main gates in early morning sunshine, the racecourse itself was bustling with activity. Their dawn gallops done, work riders sat around smoking and sipping coffee, while the blinding studio lights on a gantry overlooking the parade ring illuminated the fresh-faced features of Oli Bell and guests as they recorded ITV’s daily primer The Opening Show. Around the concourse various groups of casual workers received last-minute instruction before bracing themselves for a hard day’s graft in front of griddles and behind beer pumps, while those employed by the more exclusive dining and drinking emporiums engaged in the last-minute buffing and polishing of glass and silverware before the arrival of well-heeled guests. Many of them touched down in a steady stream of helicopters before being driven up a VIP corridor adjacent to the run-in in courtesy of chauffeur-driven Bentleys. Oh, how the other half live. It was all a giddy preamble ahead of the first of 28 races scheduled to take place this week, with Irish raiders expected to continue their astonishing dominance of last year. However, first blood in the Supreme went to the English, with the fall three out of the Willie Mullins-trained Dysart Dynamo leaving the way clear for Constitution Hill to lead home a Nicky Henderson one-two in the most convincing style. Sent off the 9-4 joint favourite, there was nothing half-hearted about the roars that encouraged Nico de Boinville’s five-year-old mount up the home straight and past the winning post as he left his stablemate Jonbon trailing 22 lengths behind. One of three Mullins entries, Kilcruit was a surprisingly distant third. “That was awesome,” said a delighted Henderson, who later saddled the 18-1 outsider Marie’s Rock to win the Mares’ Hurdle. “I know what the second horse is and I would have been very surprised if anything could have done that to Jonbon, so he must be an extraordinary animal. The hype horse earlier on in the year was Jonbon, then this fella woke up from his slumbers at home and we suddenly realised that actually he was very good.” Sadly, it was not all good news for a racing industry still trying to rebuild its reputation after being found seriously in breach of its unwritten social contract with the public following the leak of abhorrent photographs and video footage featuring the desecration of racehorses, and the Festival suffered its first equine fatality of the week in the Supreme in Shallwehaveonemore. In a field of athletic endeavour where occasional casualties are a tragic inevitability, it is to be hoped that in the coming days it is only discarded betting slips and empty pint pots that pile high.",Sport/Sport,Cheltenham’s punters return to give Rachael Blackmore overdue acclaim | Barry Glendenning,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/15/cheltenhams-punters-return-to-give-rachael-blackmore-overdue-acclaim
3/16/2022,"Russian shells and missiles pounded Kyiv, killing at least five people and prompting city hall to impose a 35-hour curfew amid signs the invading force was tightening its grip on the Ukrainian capital. In the east, the airport in Dnipro sustained massive damage overnight, while Russian forces launched more than 60 strikes on Kharkiv. A series of four heavy pre-dawn explosions rocked residential districts of the capital early on Tuesday. One strike hit a 16-storey housing block where fire raged and smoke billowed from the shattered skeleton of the building. The number of people leaving Ukraine as refugees passed three million, in what NGOs have called Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war. The UN said that nearly 1.4 million children – almost one every second – had left Ukraine since the invasion began on 24 February. On Thursday 24 February, Russia attacked Ukraine along multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war. On Friday 25 February, Russian forces reached the outskirts of Kyiv and carried out an amphibious assault from the Sea of Azov near Mariupol. The shape of the Russian incursion became clearer: On Saturday 26 February, Russian forces in control of territory to the north-west of Kyiv continued their assault on the capital. Elsewhere, heavy fighting was reported in and around Kharkiv and there were Ukrainian counterattacks in some places previously claimed by Russian forces. On Monday 28 February, Russian rocket attacks killed dozens of people in Kharkiv. Pre-dawn blasts were heard again in Kyiv and in Mariupol, which was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack. On Tuesday 1 March, Russian forces bombarded the government headquarters in Kharkiv, and the armoured column continued rolling towards the capital. On Wednesday 2 March, Moscow’s forces took the port and train station in the strategically important city of Kherson, on the Black Sea. Russian paratroopers landed in Kharkiv, after several days of fierce bombardment. Kyiv came under more heavy shelling. A week into the Russian invasion, on Thursday 3 March, the Black Sea port of Kherson became the first major Ukrainian target to fall under the de facto control of Moscow’s forces. On Friday 4 March the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was seized by Russian military forces after a fire sparked by overnight shelling burned for several hours. On Saturday 5 March a deal to evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol and the nearby town of Volnovakha collapsed, and residents in occupied Kherson and Melitopol took part in anti-Russia demonstrations. On Sunday 6 March civilians came under fire as they tried to leave areas including Irpin, where a young family was killed. On Monday 7 March Ukraine dismissed as immoral and unacceptable Russian proposals to evacuate civilians along routes into Russia or Belarus. On Tuesday 8 March civilians left Sumy and Irpin in the north, and Russia was accused of violating a ceasefire by shelling a proposed humanitarian corridor from besieged Mariupol. On Wednesday 9 March, a children’s hospital and maternity ward in Mariupol was destroyed by a Russian air strike. On Thursday 10 March a humanitarian convoy trying to reach Mariupol was forced to turn around due to fighting, and airstrikes struck the western city of Zhytomyr. Satellite images showed the extent of the destruction in Mariupol. Drone footage emerged of a Ukrainian ambush on a Russian armoured column just outside Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv. On Friday 11 March Russian airstrikes hit three cities, including two in the country’s west, as the scope of the military offensive widened. On Sunday 13 March Russia struck a military base close to the Polish border that has previously hosted foreign military trainers from the UK, US and other countries. On Monday 14 March a convoy of more than 160 cars left Mariupol in what appears to be the first successful use of a “humanitarian corridor” to evacuate civilians from the besieged port city. Moscow’s forces have stepped up their campaign to capture Kyiv, where one person was killed and several other wounded in a strike on a block of flats in Obolon district. Over the previous few months Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/russia-war-ukraine-complete-guide-maps-video-and-pictures
3/16/2022,"It is 7.15pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: A series of Russian strikes hit a residential neighbourhood in the capital on Tuesday morning, igniting a huge fire and prompting a frantic rescue effort in a 15-storey apartment building. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said five people were killed in the airstrikes on residential buildings this morning. About 2,000 cars were able to leave the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, according to local authorities. Officials said a further 2,000 cars were waiting to leave the city. Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said a convoy with supplies for Mariupol was stuck at nearby Berdyansk. ​ There are reports that Russian forces have taken patients and medical staff of a hospital in Mariupol as hostages. More than 100 buses carrying civilians have left the besieged city of Sumy in north-eastern Ukraine for a safe area, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. The evacuation consists of two separate convoys headed towards Poltava, in central Ukraine, ICRC spokesperson Jason Straziuso told Reuters. Talks between Russia and Ukraine resumed this afternoon, Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said. On Monday, Podolyak said negotiations had taken a “technical pause” until Tuesday for “additional work in the working subgroups and clarification of individual definitions”. US president Joe Biden will attend an EU summit in Brussels next week, an EU official said, according to AFP. Nearly 100 children have died in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, ​Zelenskiy said in a virtual address to Canadian lawmakers. Zelenskiy pleaded for Canada and its allies to do more to stop the Russian invasion of his country, including establishing a no-fly zone as civilian casualties mount. A woman who interrupted a live news programme on Russian state TV last night to protest against the war in Ukraine has been fined 30,000 roubles (£215) by a Russian court. Marina Ovsyannikova, a Russian television producer, was found guilty of flouting protest legislation, the Russian state news agency RIA reported. Russian prosecutors have asked a court to move jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny to a maximum security prison after requesting that he serve 13 years in prison on new fraud charges, AFP reported. Navalny, Vladimir Putin’s most vocal critic in Russia, was jailed last year for parole violations related to charges he says were trumped up. The UK is to impose sanctions on 370 more Russian individuals, including more than 50 oligarchs and their families with a combined net worth of £100bn. More than 1,000 individuals and entities have now been targeted with sanctions since the invasion of Ukraine, with fresh measures announced against key Kremlin spokespeople and political allies of Putin, including the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. More than 100,000 people have offered homes to Ukrainian refugees in the first 24 hours of a government scheme that allows families and individuals to bring them to the UK. The website for registering interest in the scheme crashed for a short while because of the numbers offering help. An adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymr Zelenskiy, said on Tuesday that the war in Ukraine was at a crossroads that could lead either to an agreement at talks with Russia or a new Russian offensive. Russia’s defence ministry spokesperson, Igor Konashenkov, said on Tuesday that Russian forces had taken full control of all territory in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, Russian news agencies reported. An adviser in the Ukraine government says the war should be over by May because Russia will run out of resources to keep the invasion going. The leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia are travelling on Tuesday to Kyiv on a European Union mission to show support for Ukraine as Russia’s invasion intensifies. The British Ministry of Defence (MoD) says Russia has reportedly installed its own mayor in the city of Melitopol after the alleged abduction of his predecessor on Friday. Nearly all of the Russian military offensives in Ukraine remain stalled after making little progress over the weekend, according to a Pentagon briefing. Russian troops are still about 15km (9 miles) from the centre of Kyiv, a US defence official said, according to a Reuters report. Zelenskiy has used his latest address to urge Russian troops to choose surrender over the “shame” of continuing with the war. Speaking partly in Russian, he said the war had become a “nightmare” for Russia and that it had now lost more soldiers in Ukraine than during both Chechen wars combined. The Kremlin said on Tuesday that the actions of a woman who interrupted a live news bulletin on Russia’s state TV Channel One on Monday to denounce the war in Ukraine amounted to “hooliganism”. UK ministers have imposed a series of new export bans and tariffs on Russian products, the morning after the passage of the economic crime bill, intended to make it swifter and easier to target oligarchs and Russian interests. Ukraine will make a fresh attempt to deliver supplies to civilians trapped in the encircled city of Mariupol on Tuesday, the deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said. Turkey’s foreign minister said he expected to evacuate citizens from Ukraine’s southern port city of Mariupol on Tuesday or Wednesday, he told reporters after a phone call with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. The EU has this morning formally agreed to a fourth package of sanctions, including an asset freeze and travel ban on Roman Abramovich. The full details are expected to be published in the Official Journal of the European Union later today. Abramovich, the Chelsea FC owner, is described as a “Russian oligarch who has long and close ties to Vladimir Putin”, in a copy of the EU’s legal text relating to its latest sanctions package. Boris Johnson has urged the west to end its “addiction” to Russian fuel as he heads for Saudi Arabia in a push for increased oil output. Almost 89,000 people have offered homes to Ukrainian refugees in the first hours of a government scheme that allows families and individuals to bring them to the UK. Former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder met Abramovich in Moscow for several hours last Thursday, tabloid Bild reports on Tuesday.

3/16/2022,"There was a false start to the first race, a tangle of horses that delayed the famous old Cheltenham roar by a few seconds. But when it came it, was full-throated and passionate. “It’s good to be back,” said race-goer John Knowles, a retired builder from Cheshire who was dressed top to toe in emerald green and gold – the colours of his favourite racehorse owner, JP McManus. “I missed Cheltenham last year. I watched it on the telly, but it’s not the same. I’ve been coming here for 30 years and this place grabs you; it’s very special.” The 2021 festival took place behind closed doors because of Covid. The year before, it was staged under something of a cloud as the coronavirus storm loomed, and came to be regarded by many as a super-spreader event. So this year’s festival has been much anticipated. Gold Cup day on Friday sold out more quickly than ever before, and a record crowd – approaching 70,000 – piled into the sun-dappled course for day one on Tuesday. Lauren Hall, 25, a veterinary nurse, was drinking in the atmosphere. She worked at last year’s very different festival. “It was a really strange experience,” she said. “I remember there being drones everywhere filming everything, but there were no people. Walking into this year’s festival was such a thrill. The crowds look enormous. It feels like we have finally put the pandemic behind us. The atmosphere is incredible.” The 2022 festival is once again that riot of colour and life which for many signals the start of spring. Tweed-wearing aristocrats rub shoulders with suited-and-booted reality TV stars, footballers, farmers and fun-seekers. Among the stars out and about on day one were pop stars Ronan Keating and Rod Stewart and the chef and presenter Prue Leith. For some, the focus is to try to win a bit of money, but many others are there to sink as many pints of Guinness or glasses of champagne as possible. This time, after the long, hard years of Covid, Cheltenham is also a place of joyful reunion. Steph Ackrill, who was busy in the tented shopping area selling silk scarves with designs based on the Cotswolds countryside, said she had woken up nervous but was relishing the day. “I’ve been meeting up with people I haven’t seen for two years. There’s lots of hugging going on. Seeing everyone coming in and being reunited is wonderful.” The Irish, who make the pilgrimage to Gloucestershire in their tens of thousands, were also very much in evidence. Among them was a group of twentysomethings from Galway, brothers Cathal and David Newell and their pals Eoin Collins and Stephen Gavin. It was their first trip to Cheltenham. “We’re first-timers; virgins, you could say,” said Collins. David Newell said they had been planning to come for several years. “It suddenly clicked and we could all come this time. We thought we’d be wearing masks and everything, and were worried that it might not go ahead. But there doesn’t seem to be a problem.” Very few people wore masks, and the Guinness village, champagne bars and hospitality tents were packed. “It’s brilliant to be back,” said on-course bookmaker Elizabeth Jeal. “I cried last year. I’m not worried about Covid this year. We’ve just got to get on with it.” John Payne, a councillor for the nearby village of Prestbury, had mixed feelings. “On the positive side it is another step on the path to normal, and the income will undoubtedly help the economy of Cheltenham.” The festival is a huge money-spinner for the area, bringing in an estimated £100m to the local economy. “On the downside, we are still living with Covid.

The horse Shallwehaveonemore suffered a fatal injury after falling at the final fence in the first race. Chris Luffingham, campaigns director at the League Against Cruel Sports, believes too many horses have died at Cheltenham, saying that “new, tighter safety measures need to be introduced to stop this senseless loss of life.” The Jockey Club, which owns and runs the racecourse, is raising money for the people of Ukraine and has renamed a race “the Ukraine Appeal National Hunt Chase”. Jockeys were encouraged to wear armbands in the colours of the Ukrainian flag. But, as ever, many were treating the event as a break from the troubles of everyday life.

3/16/2022,"Neil Faulkner, who has died aged 64 of lymphoma, was an archaeologist and writer, editor of Military History Matters and a political activist. He described his pioneering archaeological work the Great Arab Revolt Project (Garp) in southern Jordan and the Sedgeford Historical and Archaeological Research Project (Sharp) in Norfolk as “grounding truth”. Faulkner founded Sharp in 1996 as an exercise in “democratic archaeology”, in which everyone involved, from professional experts to amateur volunteers, worked together. The project, based around the north-west Norfolk village of Sedgeford, initially focused on the remains of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, but excavations widened and the entire history of the parish is being investigated from the Mesolithic to the first world war. The most important discovery has been a large malt-processing complex, with evidence of at least three grain-drying ovens and associated features from around AD800. In addition an iron age hoard of 32 Gallo-Belgic E gold coins known as “staters” was found buried in a cow bone in 2003. This community-based fieldwork at Sedgeford is now one of the largest independent archaeological projects in Britain, and has provided courses and research opportunities for thousands of trainee archaeologists since its inception. Garp was cutting-edge modern conflict archaeology, a 10-year project co-directed with Nicholas Saunders of the University of Bristol, excavating the Arab revolt against the Turks during the first world war. Faulkner admired the mischievous, precocious figure of TE Lawrence, and his brilliance as a military commander and writer, lamenting that the British myth-making machine had turned Lawrence of Arabia into “a metaphor for the imperialism that tore the region apart a century ago”. He empathised with Lawrence’s shattered psyche after the Sykes-Picot agreement that carved up the Middle East after the first world war and betrayed everything the Arabs had fought for. He also admired Lawrence’s skill in uniting previously warring desert clans into a unified fighting machine, seeing in this an analogy for the warring tribes of today’s sectarian left, who would rather argue than take on a common enemy. Lawrence was a liminal character, moving between spaces and cultures. To him, the tribes were a vapour “moving without front or back” that could win against the “rootedness of a standing army”. Faulkner, who knew and understood the importance of landscape, terrain and military strategy, pointed out that Lawrence’s famous war memoir Seven Pillars of Wisdom was studied by the Vietcong, the Taliban and even the US army. I recall working with Faulkner and his team in Jordan, excavating Ottoman tent rings, circles of stones that had weighted down soldiers’ tents in 1917: boy soldiers known as Mehmetçiks – little Mehmets, the equivalent of the British army’s Tommys, conscripted into a war not of their making. Scraping away at sand and soil revealed the detritus of men living together: bits of playing card, tunic buttons, boot leather, cigarette packets, oil lamps. For Faulkner archaeology was about people, whichever side they were on. He drew on his field research for his 2016 book Lawrence of Arabia’s War: The Arabs, the British and the Remaking of the Middle East in WW1. He published about 20 books altogether, including The Decline and Fall of Roman Britain (2000), Apocalypse: The Great Jewish Revolt Against Rome AD 66-73 (2004), Rome: Empire of the Eagles (2008); Digging Sedgeford: A People’s Archaeology (2014, co-edited with Gary Rossin and Keith Robinson), Creeping Fascism: What It Is and How to Fight It (2017), and his last book Empire and Jihad: The Anglo-Arab Wars of 1870-1920 (2021). Archaeology and writing were integral to his life as an activist. For Faulkner, theory and knowledge was little use without practice, and he was a committed revolutionary socialist. His articulate clarity, whether at one of the Brick Lane Debates, which he set up in the East End of London (believing that debate and discussion face to face was more motivating and transformative), or at any of the other meetings he addressed, could up your political game. He was passionate but not messianic – a mentor and inspiration to many young activists. Faulkner wore his learning and authority lightly, listening to and encouraging others. In 2020 he was on the co-ordinating committee of Anti-Capitalist Resistance – its mission statement “revolutionary transformation to meet the compound crisis of ecological disaster, economic collapse, social decay, grotesque inequality, mass impoverishment, growing militarisation, and creeping authoritarianism”. Faulkner was also an accomplished broadcaster, appearing notably on the BBC’s Timewatch, Channel 4’s Time Team and the recent series of YouTube programmes – The History Fix – for Housmans bookshop. This was based on his 2018 book A Radical History of the World, published by the new Left Book Club in its series of radical books sent to its membership. Faulkner, with others, was instrumental in re-establishing the LBC, originally set up in the 1930s by Victor Gollancz, and now run by Pluto Books. As a supporter of the Stop the War coalition and an advocate of the tradition of the political pamphlet and its place in activism, Faulkner, at the time of the first world war centenary, launched the pamphlet No Glory: The Real History of the First World War, regarding the conflict as “a rich man’s war in which 15 million poor men died”. His writing is beautifully accessible, as at the start of No Glory: “The last veteran of the trenches is dead. This is fortunate for our rulers. Were he still alive, Harry Patch’s voice would be heard denouncing their jingoism and warmongering as we enter the centenary of the First World War ... He told Tony Blair to his face that ‘war is organised murder’.” Faulkner studied the state mechanics and human psychology of war – to understand how it builds, the class basis of war, as well as its inverse, revolution. Born in Walthamstow, north-east London, brought up in the Weald of Kent and educated at the Skinners’ school in Tunbridge Wells and at King’s College, Cambridge, where he studied social and political sciences. He taught history and sociology at Fullbrook school in north-west Surrey from 1984 to 1988 and was then head of sociology at the Frances Bardsley school, in Romford, east London for two years before retraining as an archaeologist at the Institute of Archaeology, University College London, where he was joint winner of the Petrie prize. He lived in St Albans, Hertfordshire. He is survived by his partner, Lucy, their three children, Tiggy, Rowena and Finnian, his sister, Maura, and mother, Mary.

3/16/2022,"Covid infection levels in the UK on are on the rise once more. We take a look at the current situation, and what the future might hold. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, based on swabs from randomly selected households, infection levels are rising in the UK. In the week ending 5 March, about one in 25 people in the community in England had Covid, with the figures even higher in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where they were one in 18 and one in 13 respectively. In Wales the latest figure was 1 in 30. Experts say there are likely to be many factors at play, including the relaxation of Covid measures, changes in people’s behaviour – such as increased socialisation and reduced mask-wearing – the rise of the BA.2 Omicron variant, which appears to be more transmissible than the earlier BA.1 Omicron variant, school half terms, and possible waning of immunity conferred by booster jabs. However, it is difficult to unpick which is having the biggest impact, and this may differ around the UK. Sadly, yes. While Covid vaccinations have weakened the link between infections and serious outcomes, they have not broken it. Hospitalisations are already rising in the UK, although it is difficult to unpick how many are directly because of Covid. Dr David Strain, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter medical school, said the length of stay for patients was also increasing. “This is likely to represent a difference in disease course of BA.2 compared to BA.1,” he said. “The increased transmissibility of BA.2 is causing a higher number of patients and staff contracting it even after very brief contact,” he added, which is having an impact on staffing levels. The impact on deaths will take a little longer to become clear, given the lag between people becoming sick and their condition deteriorating. The number of people with Covid in hospital across the UK rose from 10,500 on 26 February to 11,944 on 10 March, in line with rising infections. However, just 254 of them are on mechanical ventilation, reflecting Omicron’s less serious impact than Delta and fact that eight out of 10 adults have had a Covid booster vaccine. Intensive care doctors say that many Covid inpatients are partly or wholly unvaccinated. The UK health secretary, Sajid Javid, has said that the rising numbers were “expected” and are “not something that’s of particular concern”. However, Chris Hopson, chief executive of English hospitals body NHS Providers, has warned that “while it is positive that the overall number in hospital remains low compared to previous waves, rising admissions can have knock-on effects for patient care”. The mood appears to be one of unease rather than alarm. Speaking in a personal capacity, Prof Cath Noakes, an expert in environmental engineering for buildings at the University of Leeds and a member of Sage, said the current situation was not unexpected. “It was always predicted that as restrictions are removed that cases would rise,” she said. “But as this happened at a time when cases were already very high it will have more of an impact both on the pressure on the NHS and the disruption to schools and business from the very high numbers of people who are off sick.” Noakes added it was very important to keep a close eye on hospitalisations and cases among older people, given outcomes for this group could be far more serious. “With the prevalence at least one in 25 and higher in some parts of the UK, the chance of infection is really high and the reduction in testing and lack of requirement to isolate mean that there may be far more infectious people who are still interacting in the community than before,” she said. One concern raised by experts is that public behaviour was still a long way from what it was pre-pandemic, meaning there is potential for a further rise in infections. “I’m expecting cases to go up and down and maybe up again as the balance between increased mixing, immunity following vaccination and infection, and waning immunity shifts, and as the next variant emerges,” said Prof Tim Colbourn of University College London, adding cases could be in the range of 30,000 to 100,000 a day for the foreseeable future. “Hospitalisations and deaths should stay relatively low because of protection via vaccination, drugs and prior infection, and this should apply to new variants too as it has done for previous variants,” Colbourn said, noting excess mortality had been negative since the start of 2022. The UK is not alone in seeing a rise in infections. An increase has also occurred in Germany and the Netherlands, among other countries in Europe, while China has recently reinstated lockdowns in certain hotspots to try to tackle a surge related to the Omicron variant, with Hong Kong warning its hospitals were being overwhelmed. The main reason appears to be low rates of vaccination among older age groups. Recent government data suggests just over 55% of those aged 80 and over have had one dose, with just over 36% having had two and far fewer having had three. In addition, a zero Covid approach means there is little natural immunity in the population. “There are indications that hesitancy is high and actual access to vaccines appear to be an issue,” said Dr Michael Head is a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton. Noakes said a similar situation was unlikely to occur in the UK in the short term. “But it serves as a reminder that this virus is still a killer among an unvaccinated population and that the milder effects that we are experiencing in the UK are almost certainly due to our high levels of vaccination coverage,” she said.",News/World news,How concerning is it that Covid infections are rising in the UK?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/how-concerning-is-it-that-covid-infections-are-rising-in-the-uk
3/16/2022,"The EU has imposed sanctions on the boss of anti-war protester Marina Ovsyannikova at Russia’s Channel One, along with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich for his “very good relations with Vladimir Putin”. Konstantin Ernst, the chief executive of the state-controlled TV channel, and Chelsea football club’s owner are among 15 individuals newly targeted by the EU, according to the agreed text. On Abramovich, the EU said that it was following the UK in imposing sanctions as he had “long and close ties to Vladimir Putin”, adding that he had “privileged access to the president, and has maintained very good relations with him”. “This connection with the Russian leader helped him to maintain his considerable wealth,” the EU text says. Abramovich was seen on Monday in a VIP lounge at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport shortly before a jet linked to him took off for Istanbul. Along with the extended list of individuals on whom asset freeze and travel bans are imposed the EU is also banning investments in Russia’s energy sector, as well as exports of finished steel products worth €3.3bn a year to the Russian economy and most luxury goods, such as precious stones, clothes and carpets, over the value of €300 (£252) and cars priced at more than €50,000. Other luxuries covered by the export ban are horses, caviar, truffles, wine, beer, spirits, tobacco products, leather products, handbags, clothing, clocks, watches, works of art, musical instruments and sports equipment. There is also a transaction ban with nine Russian state-owned enterprises, though none of them are in the oil and gas sector, and the EU has prohibited the rating of the country and its companies by credit rating agencies. Brussels has made a discernible effort to squeeze individuals and entities that have aided Putin in spreading his message about the invasion of Ukraine. RT and Sputnik have already been prohibited from broadcasting within the 27 member states and the inclusion of Ernst and a presenter Channel One, Artyom Sheynin, in the EU list has added poignancy after the protest by his colleague on Monday evening. Ovsyannikova, an editor at Channel One, had burst on to the set of the live broadcast of the nightly news, shouting: “Stop the war. No to war.” She also held a sign saying: “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” It was signed in English: “Russians against the war.” She has been arrested and her whereabouts are unknown. The EU’s legal text on its fourth round of sanctions describes Ernst as being “responsible for organising and disseminating anti-Ukrainian propaganda of the Russian authorities”. It notes that he has “also received the highest state awards, including the orders For Services to the Fatherland, the Order of Friendship, letters of appreciation and prizes from the government and the president of the Russian Federation, as well as the medal ‘To the participant in the military operation in Syria’”. Sheynin, who worked alongside Ovsyannikova, is said to be a “a Russian propagandist and presenter of talkshow Vremya Pokazhet (“Time will tell”) on the state-controlled TV Channel One”. The text says: “He made statements in support of the illegal annexation of Crimea and recognition of the independence of the so-called Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics. In his live broadcasts, Sheynin promotes ethnic hatred between Ukrainians and Russians, denies the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and slanders Putin’s opponents in Russia.” It adds: “Talking about 24 February 2022, the day of the Russian full-scale unjustified military aggression against Ukraine, Sheynin stated that the Russian operation in Ukraine was inevitable and its purpose was to force the Ukrainian authorities to maintain peace.” Also included on the list is Tigran Khudaverdyan, the executive director of Yandex, the Russian-language search engine and web portal. Yandex’s former head of news, Lev Gershenzon, accused the company earlier this month of being a “key element in hiding information” from Russians about the war in Ukraine. According to the EU, the company has been “warning Russian users looking for news about Ukraine on its search engine of unreliable information on the internet, after the Russian government threatened Russian media over what they publish”. Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, said: “This fourth package of sanctions is another major blow to the economic and logistic base upon which Russia relies on to carry out the invasion of Ukraine. The aim of the sanctions is that President Putin stops this inhuman and senseless war.” Shareholders in the Alfa group investment conglomerate, German Khan and Alexey Kuzmichev, are also on the sanctions list. Some of Europe’s big industrial producers, including Germany and Italy, successfully won exemptions, however, so the export bans will not include iron ore, palladium and nickel. Poland and the Baltic States had battled to close down these exemptions, but lostout to a group of more conservative member states, including Germany, Italy, Hungary and Bulgaria, according to diplomatic sources. “The ‘sanctionistas’, Poland and the Balts, are afraid the others are missing the sense of urgency, especially as rockets are landing near their borders,” one EU diplomat said.",News/World news,EU hits Roman Abramovich with sanctions in new action against Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/eu-roman-abramovich-sanctions-russia-tv-protester
3/16/2022,"A Russian court has fined Marina Ovsyannikova 30,000 roubles (£215) for violating protest laws after she broke onto a live news broadcast on Channel One in an extraordinary demonstration against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The fine was a relatively light sentence for an act of protest that shocked Russian television viewers and earned plaudits from western leaders. Emmanuel Macron of France even offered her consular “protection” and said he would raise her case with Vladimir Putin. In a legal twist, Ovsyannikova was fined not for breaking onto the Channel One set but for a video statement she made before the protest in which she said she was “ashamed” of having worked at Channel One and spreading “Kremlin propaganda”. “These were indeed some of the hardest days of my life,” she told reporters following the short hearing. “I spent two days without sleep. I was questioned for more than 14 hours. They didn’t allow me to reach my family or give me any legal aid. I was in a fairly difficult position.” She also said she wasn’t surprised at her release because she had two children. Friends and supporters feared the worst after Ovsyannikova disappeared into police custody for nearly 24 hours after her arrest, suspecting that prosecutors may be preparing serious criminal charges against her. Russian state media also reported that the powerful investigative committee had opened a case against her. Lawyers spent much of the night scouring local police precincts to find her. She was detained on Tuesday evening after running on to the set of the evening news with a poster that read: “Stop the war. Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” She finally reappeared on Tuesday evening in a Moscow courtroom. In a photograph alongside a lawyer, she appeared unharmed and was wearing the same outfit and necklace in the colours of the Ukrainian flag as a day earlier. The Kremlin had suggested that Ovsyannikova had violated laws on hooliganism that can carry a sentence of years in prison. Lawyers said it was still possible that prosecutors would press tougher charges against Ovsyannikova, but that it was less likely following Tuesday’s hearing. “There are still risks that a criminal case will be opened against Ovsyannikova, but the chances of that have sharply decreased after the fine that she received today,” said Pavel Chikov, the head of Agora International Human Rights Group. “She has been fined not for her performance, but for her video message in which she urged people to protest.” “No case has been opened yet against her performance, and the prosecutor’s office might still decide to do so,” he continued. “But, the fact that she has already received a quick punishment indicates that a political decision has been made not to persecute her further.” Tatiana Stanovaya, a political analyst and founder of R Politik, said that there were probably differing views among Kremlin advisers about how to deal with Ovsyannikova’s case. While some may have lobbied for a tough response, others could have feared a backlash if the mother of two was treated too harshly. “Nobody was ready for something like this ahead of time,” she said. “And the Kremlin wouldn’t have a ready template for how to react.” Several prominent journalists have reportedly left their positions at state media since Ovsyannikova’s protest. “I’m interested by the amount of discontent inside of the system,” said Stanovaya. “Either right now this wave comes to nothing. Or we can see similar protests more and more often – these vocal, desperate acts where people make similar gestures.”",News/World news,Marina Ovsyannikova: Russian journalist fined after live broadcast protest,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/marina-ovsyannikova-russian-journalist-fined-for-live-broadcast-protest
3/16/2022,"Two Fox News journalists – producer Oleksandra Kuvshynova and cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski – were killed in the attack outside Kyiv which injured correspondent Benjamin Hall, the US network and its journalists confirmed on Tuesday. Fox News in a statement only announced the death of Zakrzewski, an Irish citizen. Ukrainian officials and Fox News reporters confirmed that Kuvshynova was also killed in the attack. “RIP Pierre and Sasha,” the Fox News Pentagon correspondent, Lucas Tomlinson, wrote on Twitter, using a diminutive name for the producer, and sharing a recent picture of the two, smiling with Hall. Zakrzewski, 55, and Kuvshynova, 24, died “as a result of artillery shelling by Russian troops in the north-eastern part of the village of Gorenka”, Ukrainian website kp.ua said. The news follows the death in Ukraine on Sunday of Brent Renaud, an American film-maker, who was shot in an area near where the Fox journalists were attacked. Fox News had announced Hall’s injury on Monday, the reporter “was injured while newsgathering outside of Kyiv in Ukraine”. Fox News’ chief executive, Suzanne Scott, said: “Pierre was killed in Horenka, outside of Kyiv, Ukraine. Pierre was with Benjamin Hall yesterday … when their vehicle was struck by incoming fire. “Pierre was a war zone photographer who covered nearly every international story for Fox News from Iraq to Afghanistan to Syria during his long tenure with us. “His passion and talent as a journalist were unmatched. Based in London, Pierre had been working in Ukraine since February. His talents were fast and there wasn’t a role that he didn’t jump in to help with in the field – from photographer to engineer to editor to producer – and he did it all under immense pressure with tremendous skill.” Fox News did not initially mention Kuvshynova’s death, but in a second statement later on Tuesday, said she had been working as a consultant for the channel. It read: “She was incredibly talented and spent weeks working directly with our entire team, operating around the clock to make sure the world knew what was happening in her country.” The statement described Kuvshynova as “hard-working, funny, kind and brave. Her dream was to connect people around the world and tell their stories, and she fulfilled that through her journalism.” The statement added: “We held off on delivering this devastating news earlier today out of respect for her family whom we have been in touch with throughout.” Yonat Friling, a Fox News field producer, tweeted: “In yesterday’s attack near Kyiv, we have lost a beautiful brave woman – Oleksandra Kuvshinova – Sasha. She loved music and she was funny and kind. she was 24 years old. She worked with our team for the past month and did a brilliant job. May her memory be a blessing.” Trey Yingst, a Fox News foreign correspondent, tweeted a picture with Zakrzewski and said: “I don’t know what to say. Pierre was as good as they come. Selfless. Brave. Passionate. I’m so sorry this happened to you.” Hall, who is British-American, remained in hospital on Tuesday. Ukrainian authorities said he had “lost part of his leg”. Fox News said it was still trying to gather details of the attack on its team. “We have a minimal level of details right now,” Scott said in a memo to staff on Monday that did not mention Zakrzewski or Kuvshynova. “Ben is hospitalised and our teams on the ground are working to gather additional information as the situation quickly unfolds. “The safety of our entire team of journalists in Ukraine and the surrounding regions is our top priority and of the utmost importance. This is a stark reminder for all journalists who are putting their lives on the line every day to deliver the news from the war zone.” On Sunday, Ukrainian authorities said Renaud, an award-winning film-maker, was killed by Russian forces in Irpin, outside Kyiv.

3/16/2022,"Jack Monroe’s powerful comments to the work and pensions select committee tell us more about the social security system than some MPs might have realised (Cost of living crisis could be fatal for some UK children, Jack Monroe tells MPs, 9 March). Eight years ago, Monroe told an all-party parliamentary inquiry into hunger, on which I served as secretary, that “if my benefits had been paid quickly, in full and on time, I would have been able to meet my living costs”. The cruel caps, cuts and freezes to which the social security budget has been subjected since then mean that, in Monroe’s words to the committee last week, even a 6% increase in April “is not going to adequately cover the difference in cost of living, plugging the gap for what people haven’t had for so long”. Simultaneously, while Monroe was giving evidence to the committee, one of Feeding Britain’s affordable food clubs was reporting that it was serving a new group of people who, for the first time, find themselves on the edge of crisis. Unless April’s increase in benefits is bound more closely to the rising cost of living, the size of this new group will expand at an alarming rate.Andrew ForseyNational director, Feeding Britain  Last week, I was asked if I knew of any way that a single mother of two could get help to pay for an oil delivery. She could not afford the minimum 500-litre order, the price of which has nearly doubled since her last order. I searched diligently, but while there is help for users of energy firms, there appears to be none for those who have to pay for their heating upfront, be it oil, bottled gas or even solid fuel. Here in rural Northumberland, we have no access to mains gas and even the moderately well-off are sinking into fuel poverty. This is causing real hardship and needs a rethink from the government. Taxes on wealth and excess profits, and stopping wealth being hoarded offshore, would help the economy work the way it should, supporting the most vulnerable. What we lack is a government with vision, courage, a sense of urgency and basic competence coupled with an understanding that the world has changed. I’ve left off wishing for compassion, fearing that that is too much to ask.Pam WalkerAssociate minister, Upper Wansbeck churches, Northumberland  I am surprised that there has been so little adverse comment on the large increases in daily standing charges that many gas and electricity companies have imposed as part of higher energy prices coming into force. Standing charges favour large fuel users over small ones. They disincentivise customers from reducing fuel use, and penalise poor and small households. The companies say standing charges reflect the cost of maintaining a gas or electricity connection, while the variable (per kWh) charge reflects the cost to them of purchasing power supplies. But the price of maintaining connections has not increased at all. It is the cost of buying wholesale gas and electricity that has gone up sharply, so there is no justification for raising standing charges. Ofgem says that the way firms structure their prices is up to them, provided they stay within the overall price cap. This ignores the important energy efficiency and social equity arguments against standing charges. It is time for the regulator to look again at this blatant rip-off of poorer customers.Peter CarterFormer deputy director general, Office of Electricity Regulation  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/16/2022,"Your report (Johnson announces terms of reference for Covid inquiry, 10 March) says that Lady Hallett, its chair, “will not be asked to apportion blame for any failures she identifies”. This means systemic failure is built into the inquiry. The principal role of the government is to design, maintain, implement and adapt systems. When those systems fail, it can be because of genuinely unforeseeable events. That was not the case with Covid; it was because the systems were badly designed or weren’t implemented. Blame is perhaps an ugly word, but preventing its identification also means that accountability is excluded, and without accountability, what sort of a joke of a democracy do we have? As the head of policy at the Royal Statistical Society wrote in your pages, “We shouldn’t blame mutant maths for poor policy outcomes” (From A-levels to pensions, algorithms make easy targets – but they aren’t to blame, 17 August 2021). Ascribing system failures to the systems themselves is just another way of evading responsibility for incompetence. Somebody chose that system, or chose to neglect it. Constructing the system for the inquiry to exclude accountability is building failure into its design.Dr Tony BrauerJordans, Buckinghamshire  It is incredibly disrespectful to the families of the tens of thousands of people who died at home during the pandemic for their experiences to be omitted from the terms of reference for the Covid-19 inquiry. People are dying without the vital support they need. Since the start of the pandemic, Hospice UK estimates that almost 67,000 people are likely to have missed out on specialist palliative care such as adequate pain relief. The inquiry presents an opportunity to bring this issue to light and to make sure that people are able to get the care they need. Without urgent action to find out what happened to the people dying behind closed doors, we won’t know what they experienced and thousands more could still miss out on the expert care that they deserve. Vital lessons need to be learned from the experiences of people dying at home to uncover crucial information so that people can be better supported at the end of life.Dominic CarterHead of policy and research, Hospice UK  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/16/2022,"Chelsea have withdrawn a request for Saturday’s FA Cup quarter-final at Middlesbrough to be played behind closed doors after causing exasperation and disbelief in the sport and in Downing Street with their desperate push for permission to sell tickets. There was widespread incredulity after the European champions, blocked from taking up their full allocation of 4,500 tickets at the Riverside Stadium, said they were asking the FA board “to direct that the game be played behind closed doors for matters of sporting integrity”. Middlesbrough said the suggestion was “bizarre and without any merit” and it drew a furious response from the government, who accused Chelsea of blurring their priorities with the club up for sale and Friday’s deadline for bidders to submit proposals drawing closer. The move was set to be rejected by the Football Association, which announced: “After constructive talks between the FA and Chelsea, the club has agreed to remove their request for the Emirates FA Cup quarter-final tie against Middlesbrough to be played behind closed doors. “The FA remains in ongoing discussions with Chelsea, the Premier League and the government to find a solution that would enable both Chelsea fans to attend games and away fans to attend Stamford Bridge, whilst ensuring sanctions are respected.” Chelsea have been frustrated in their attempts to make further amendments to the operating licence they are under as a result of the sanctions imposed on Roman Abramovich. The club have sold 500 tickets for Saturday’s game but the licence prohibits further sales and is intended to stop Abramovich from profiting from any income. Chelsea’s view is that the ban on ticket sales will lead to financial difficulties and they are upset that the government has not responded to their pleas. The club have issued assurances that the money from tickets would not go to Abramovich, who has been accused of having links to Vladimir Putin and the Russian state. They are also annoyed that their request to give away tickets for the Middlesbrough game for free did not receive a response from the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI). Whitehall officials said they had seen Chelsea’s statement with “disbelief” after making concessions to the club by changing parts of the licence last weekend. It was pointed out that Abramovich is linked to a “barbaric regime” and one senior government source said Chelsea’s behaviour was “like a drowning person in shark-infested waters, complaining they aren’t on an oligarch’s yacht and threatening the people throwing them a life ring”. The official said the statement was indicative that Chelsea had not fully appreciated the seriousness of their situation and the complex nature of the licence that is allowing the club to continue to play, and said the government was willing to listen further on spending limits and ensuring some away fans were able to attend. They described it as “galling” to see Chelsea say they were prepared to damage other supporters at Middlesbrough when several hundred of their fans were able to attend. The source said: “We are not opposed to Chelsea having fans at games in the long run, but we will not allow money from ticket sales to flow to a sanctioned entity. Chelsea should spend less time worrying about having a few thousand fans at one game, and focus on moving their club into the hands of someone who isn’t linked to a warmonger.” The Chelsea Supporters’ Trust had urged the club to withdraw their request, and Middlesbrough’s chairman, Steve Gibson, told the Telegraph the Premier League team’s move was “abhorrent” and described Chelsea as a “rotten football club”. A Boro statement said: “Given the reasons for these sanctions, for Chelsea to seek to invoke sporting ‘integrity’ as a reason for the game being played behind closed doors is ironic in the extreme.” said: “We are aware of Chelsea’s request to have Saturday’s Emirates FA Cup sixth round tie played behind closed doors and find their suggestion both bizarre and without any merit whatsoever.“All concerned are well aware of the reasons Chelsea have been sanctioned and that this has nothing to do with Middlesbrough Football Club. To suggest as a result that MFC and our fans should be penalised is not only grossly unfair but without any foundation. described Given the reasons for these sanctions, for Chelsea to seek to invoke sporting ‘integrity’ as a reason for the game being played behind closed doors is ironic in the extreme.” In outlining their position Chelsea had said: “It is with extreme reluctance that we are asking the FA board to direct that the game be played behind closed doors for matters of sporting integrity. Chelsea FC recognises that such an outcome would have a huge impact on Middlesbrough and its supporters, as well as our own fans who have already bought the limited number of tickets that were sold before the licence was imposed, but we believe this is the fairest way of proceeding in the current circumstances. “We will continue to discuss the issue of ticket sales with OFSI as there are a number of fixtures still to be played this season and we hope to reach a resolution.” Chelsea are still lobbying the government to lift the £20,000 cap on travel to away games. They argue it would normally cost three times as much to travel to Middlesbrough and it remains to be seen how Thomas Tuchel and his players will get to the match. Chelsea’s travel to France for Wednesday’s second leg of their last-16 Champions League tie against Lille is unaffected because it was paid for before sanctions were imposed. Chelsea are 2-0 up. Nigel Huddleston, the sports minister, said the government did not want to drive Chelsea out of business. “Can the government allow an entity to fail? Yes, it can, whether it’s sport or football or anything else, … but what we want to do is make sure the impact of sanctions hits those we want them to hit,” he said. “It’s not intended to harm other entities or the overall sports ecosystem.” Chelsea’s licence is designed to keep them in operation until 31 May and the Premier League’s director of policy and corporate affairs, Helen MacNamara, admitted: “We haven’t worked through the consequences should the club not be sold by 31 May.”",Sport/Football,Chelsea end push for Cup fan ban amid government and Middlesbrough fury,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/15/chelsea-want-middlesbrough-fa-cup-tie-behind-closed-doors-roman-abramovich
3/16/2022,"The Speaker of the House of Lords has urged ministers to toughen up the vetting and appointment system for new peers after concerns about the suitability of recent nominees such as the Evening Standard proprietor, Evgeny Lebedev. While the Speaker, Lord McFall, has no powers to limit peers’ access to parliament, his strongly-worded comment came in response to a request from the SNP for the Russia-born peer’s parliamentary pass to be revoked. Ministers have defended his appointment by his close friend Boris Johnson in 2020 after the Sunday Times reported that security services originally had concerns about Lebedev, whose father was a KGB agent, as far back as 2013. In a letter to McFall, the SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said the reported concerns of security services meant Lebedev’s pass should be rescinded. McFall does not have this power. But in a statement in response to the letter, he called for ministers to consider stronger powers for the House of Lords appointments commission (Holac), which vets candidates. Johnson is understood to have pushed forward the nomination despite Holac’s concerns about Lebedev. There was, McFall said, “a case for examination of the appointments process, including a more robust vetting system and potentially stronger powers for Holac, ensuring that new appointees are able to make a worthwhile contribution to the important work of the house. “I would urge the government to look at this, drawing upon the work of those who have already taken extensive evidence on this and proposed sensible reforms. I am always open to engagement with the government on these matters. “An examination of the appointments system is, however, just one element of what needs to be a bigger package of reform of the House of Lords, including reducing the size of the house and increasing the diversity of its members allowing us to reach out to all parts of the United Kingdom.” Since his appointment, Lebedev has spoken only once in the Lords. After a report noted this last month, he submitted two parliamentary questions. Johnson has been accused of brushing off security concerns about Lebedev, which whom he has a close relationship, attending parties at his Italian castle, including when he was foreign secretary. In his letter to McFall, Blackford said that given the reported security concerns: “Lord Lebedev is clearly not a fit and proper person to act as a legislator nor a lobbyist in this democracy. He should not therefore be in a position to maintain privileged access to the parliamentary estate”. Asked about Lebedev on Sunday, Michael Gove, the communities secretary, appeared to suggest that reopening the question of the peerage would play into the hands of Vladimir Putin. “I think one of the things that Vladimir Putin would like us to do, is to have an approach in the UK that said that everyone of Russian ancestry was somehow persona non grata,” he said. Lebedev has insisted that he is not a security risk, and that he condemns Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While the Lord Speaker has limited powers over peers, those in the role can and do express concerns about the wider running of the upper house. In 2019 McFall’s predecessor as Lord Speaker, Lord Fowler, said the Lords should reduce the number of “passengers” who contributed little to its business. He also wanted to slim down the chamber to a planned ceiling of 600. There are currently about 800 members.",News/Politics,Lord Speaker urges tougher vetting amid concerns over Evgeny Lebedev,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/15/lord-speaker-urges-ministers-to-tighten-system-for-vetting-peers
