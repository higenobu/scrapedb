1/28/2022,"Russia has said it is willing to continue talks with the US over European security, but is not optimistic about their prospects after Washington and Nato allies again rejected a key part of Russia’s proposed new order for post cold-war security. Tensions have soared in recent weeks as Russia massed more than 100,000 soldiers and heavy weapons at its border with Ukraine, raising fears of an invasion.  On Thursday, Vladimir Putin’s chief spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said “there isn’t much reason to be optimistic” after the US and Nato rejected Moscow’s demands for a veto on Ukraine’s potential membership of Nato in a co-ordinated response the day before. Moscow needed time to analyse the US document and would not “rush into assessments”, Peskov added. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow’s main concern – the potential for Ukraine to join Nato – had not been addressed, but there was hope “for the start of a serious conversation on secondary issues”. “There is no positive response in this document on the main issue,” he said. One of Lavrov’s spokespeople appeared to rule out war with Ukraine, in comments that led to a jump in the value of the Russian rouble, as investors gained confidence that conflict could be avoided. “We have already repeatedly stated that our country does not intend to attack anyone. We consider even the thought of a war between our people to be unacceptable,” said Alexei Zaitsev, a spokesman for the foreign ministry. The focus turns again to Putin, who is yet to voice his response and is being briefed on the document. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, gave an upbeat assessment on the latest diplomatic moves, noting that his diplomats would meet counterparts from Russia, Germany and France in two weeks’ time in Berlin. Diplomats from the four countries met in Paris on Wednesday and agreed to continue talking. Ukraine has been seeking to downplay reports of an imminent attack by Russia. One of Zelenskiy’s aides told Reuters the borderline “hysteria” about a Russian attack was hindering Kyiv’s attempts to borrow on international capital markets. Struggling to access private funds, Ukraine intends to seek $5bn in loans from governments and international institutions. On a visit to Copenhagen, seeking to marshal support from Nato member Denmark, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dymytro Kuleba, gave his approval of the US response to Russia. Ukraine, he said, had seen it before it was hand-delivered to Russia’s embassy in Washington. Kuleba emphasised his country’s need for stronger defences and a unified position from the west on economic sanctions. “This crisis is a moment of truth, and this is why we speak about weapons,” he said. “This is why we speak about economic sanctions. This is why we speak about the consolidated position of all of us, so that President Putin sees that there are no weak links in our defensive chain.” Pressure on Russia grew after Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, gave a strong indication that the Nord Steam 2 gas pipeline would be part of the sanctions package if Moscow ordered an invasion. “We are working on a strong package of sanctions” with western allies, and it covers several aspects “including Nord Stream 2”, Baerbock told the Bundestag. Her statement came soon after the US State Department said the pipeline would not move forward if Russia invades Ukraine. The pipeline connecting Russia and Germany was completed last September but regulatory approval is still pending. Baerbock reaffirmed that Germany would not lift its export ban on weapons, despite pressure from allies. Germany faced criticism from the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, who described Berlin’s offer to send 5,000 military helmets as a joke.

1/28/2022,"Prince Andrew has filed his answer and defences to Virginia Giuffre’s sexual abuse lawsuit against him, brought in the New York district court. Here are some of the key points from the court papers. The prince’s lawyers say: Prince Andrew denies the allegations contained in paragraph one of the complaint. (Paragraph one of the complaint: “This suit arises out of defendant’s sexual abuse of plaintiff when she was under the age of 18 years old.”)  Prince Andrew lacks sufficient information to admit or deny the allegations contained in paragraph two of the complaint. (Paragraph two: “During 2000–2002, beginning when plaintiff was 16, plaintiff was the victim of sex trafficking and abuse by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.”) Prince Andrew denies the first clause in paragraph seven of the complaint. He lacks sufficient information to admit or deny the remaining allegations contained in that paragraph. (Paragraph seven: “Prince Andrew was a close friend of Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite who spent years overseeing and managing Epstein’s sex trafficking network, and actively recruited underage girls, including plaintiff.”) Prince Andrew denies the allegations contained in paragraph nine of the complaint. (Paragraph nine: “After publicly feigning ignorance about the scope of Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation and sympathy for Epstein’s victims, Prince Andrew has refused to cooperate with US authorities in their investigation and prosecution of Epstein and his co-conspirators.”) Prince Andrew admits that he met Epstein in or around 1999. He denies the remaining allegations in the first sentence of paragraph 30 of the complaint, and lacks sufficient information to admit or deny the allegations contained in the second sentence of that paragraph. (Paragraph 30: “According to Prince Andrew, he first met Epstein in 1999 through Maxwell, Prince Andrew’s close friend. Prince Andrew and Maxwell have been photographed at numerous social events together.”) Prince Andrew lacks sufficient information to admit or deny the allegations contained in paragraph 33 of the complaint. (Paragraph 33: “In 2006, Prince Andrew invited Epstein to his daughter’s 18th birthday party, despite Epstein being charged with procuring a minor for prostitution only one month prior.”) Prince Andrew lacks sufficient information to admit or deny the allegations contained in paragraph 38 of the complaint. (Paragraph 38: “The below photograph depicts Prince Andrew, plaintiff, and Maxwell at Maxwell’s home prior to Prince Andrew sexually abusing plaintiff.”) [Virginia] Giuffre’s complaint should be dismissed because this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the action. Giuffre, through her own actions, inactions, and other conduct – including, without limitation, entering into the 2009 release agreement with Epstein containing a broad third-party release of her claims against Prince Andrew and others – waived the claims now asserted in the complaint. Assuming, without admitting, that Giuffre has suffered any injury or damage, Giuffre and/or others, who are not Prince Andrew, contributed in whole or in part to the alleged damage. Assuming, without admitting, that Giuffre has suffered any injury or damage alleged in the complaint, Giuffre’s claims are barred by the doctrine of consent. Giuffre’s alleged causes of action are barred in whole or in part by her own wrongful conduct and the doctrine of unclean hands.

1/28/2022,"Fendi, the Italian luxury brand now led by the British designer Kim Jones, made a bold bid for red carpet glory with an imperial procession of high-drama evening wear at Paris haute couture fashion week. The lean, strong-shouldered silhouette of the iconic Academy Awards golden trophy echoed through a collection with its sights set on the Oscars red carpet. Bustier corsetry, swagged asymmetric draping and a Vatican-purple mini cape kept the dramatic tension simmering. Extra long skirts were cut to pool majestically as the wearer paused for the flashbulbs, reflecting light upwards from their satin folds.  With the recently crowned designer of the year at its helm, and with the fortunes of its iconic Baguette bag boosted by a starring role in the Sex and the City sequel And Just Like That, Fendi is a house in its pomp. Still regal, if a little more low key, were pieces that nodded to classic black-tie menswear. A loose kaftan gown in matt midnight blue duchesse silk was edged with a stripe of jet black sequins, a finishing touch that echoed the sheen of a satin lapel on a tuxedo jacket. Jones, who divides his time between his home in London and the Fendi headquarters in Rome where he works closely with Silvia Venturini Fendi, has spoken of being inspired by the understated elegance of the Fendi family – “the way they can look so chic at work, and half an hour later they come to dinner a touch different, having changed the look”. Haute couture week will close on Friday evening with a commemorative show in honour of Pierre Cardin, who died in December 2020 aged 98. The house is now led by the late designer’s great-nephew Rodrigo Basilicati-Cardin, who worked alongside his uncle for 30 years. The show is expected to include pieces designed by the late Cardin, alongside modern interpretations of the label’s space-age aesthetic, created by the current design studio. London fashion week has announced a schedule of 37 live catwalk shows for its turn in the fashion spotlight next month as the industry moves cautiously back toward physical presentations, reflecting a consensus that digital versions have failed to entirely captivate audiences, despite their environmental and economic advantages. Molly Goddard, whose exuberant tulle dresses are beloved of Rihanna and scored a starring role on screen in Killing Eve, will make a return to the catwalk, while the independent label 16Arlington will stage a show in honour of its co-founder Federica Cavenati, who died in November aged 28. But in a blow to the box office power of the London shows, neither Burberry nor Victoria Beckham, the city’s best-known fashion names, will take part.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Fendi makes bid for Oscars red carpet with high-drama evening wear,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/27/fendi-makes-bid-for-oscars-red-carpet-with-high-drama-evening-wear
1/28/2022,"The best work of Barry Cryer, who has died aged 86, was in two different ways unseen. He wrote jokes for generations of comedians from Tommy Cooper and Morecambe and Wise through the Two Ronnies to Rory Bremner, and much of his professional pleasure came, like that of a demolition expert, from appreciating carefully engineered explosions from a distance. A lot of the big laughs he received personally came on radio, where he was a chairman during the 1972 first series of I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue before becoming a pivotal and consummate panellist for the rest of his life. While his TV appearances were much more infrequent, Cryer was immediately recognisable, partly due to to a distinctive look – prematurely white hair offset by big, thick, black-framed spectacles.  Although he often wrote or collaborated with Oxbridge-educated comics – Monty Python’s John Cleese and Graham Chapman, Graeme Garden and Tim Brooke-Taylor of the Goodies – Cryer was shaped, in attitude and language, by successive tiers of Yorkshire education. A native of Leeds, he was a grammar school student and a contemporary of Alan Bennett – both did their homework in Leeds city library, and remained forever friends. But, when Bennett went to Oxford University, Cryer read English literature at Leeds University. He worked there on a college comedy revue with fellow students Wole Soyinka and Tony Harrison, who both became major poet-playwrights. The men remained friends. Cryer’s own plan had been to become a stage and screen actor, but repeated recurrences of the severe skin condition eczema limited his availability and visibility and, as public anxiety can be a factor, encouraged him towards writing and what was then called the wireless. The illness had first occurred in childhood. Bennett’s published journals record Cryer’s story of spending much of his early years swathed from scalp to toe in emollient bandages “like the Invisible Man”. Always a sharp social observer, Cryer was astonished that all the 1930s and 40s Leeds folk he encountered were too kind and polite ever to mention this mummification, focusing on the eyes peeping between the white crepe and commenting on the weather. A running gag in Bennett’s journals is a sudden phone call from Cryer to deliver a single comment, followed by the terminating observation: “I’ll let you get back to your life!” These interventions reflected Cryer’s deep commitment to wit – he was almost always working on or trying out a new gag – but also an abiding kindness: Bennett notes that the calls often came when a friend was in trouble with life or work. They quickly cured gloominess. In a posh London shop, Cryer has overheard a mummy telling a daddy: “Remind me to tell Austin that there was no main verb in that sentence!” Or he has just heard about “the man who swallowed liquid Tipp-Ex instead of Viagra – he woke up with a massive correction!” Cryer belonged to a generation of English male comic talent reluctant to leave a meaning undoubled. The house speciality of I’m Sorry, I’ll Read That Again, predecessor to I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue, was the canny linguistics of clever deadpan punning (often turning on the disguised inclusion of words actually banned from the airwaves) that sneaked sexual meanings past the stiff blue pencil of BBC bosses. Cryer took this aural sex even further in a spin-off from the radio franchise, You’ll Have Had Your Tea, which was additionally daring in featuring him and Garden playing stereotypes of Scottish tightfistedness. Comics of Cryer’s longevity had careers bracketed by two cultural puritanisms: initially a quasi-Christian morality emanating from the political right wing and latterly a policing of personal offence that is most connected with the left. His response to the first wave of censors was coming up with filth too clever for them to detect; to the current tut-cutters, he remained unapologetic, sharing Cleese’s view that a “woke joke” is an impossibility. It was striking that the final credit of his lifetime, Now, Where Were We?, a recently recorded podcast with his son Bob, featured a majority of guests (Miriam Margolyes, Stephen Fry, Danny Baker) who have tested the edges of humour. A writer and comedy performer whose closest contemporaries, collaborators and friends included some of the biggest figures in comedy, theatre and literature might be seen by outsiders as the inferior cultural achiever. But they would acknowledge that Barry Cryer, as much as they did, put his particular talents to maximum impact and public entertainment.",Arts/Stage,"Barry Cryer was cheeky, kind and a canny engineer of comedy | Mark Lawson",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/27/mark-lawson-barry-cryer-comedy

1/28/2022,"Poland has started building a wall along its frontier with Belarus aimed at preventing asylum seekers from entering the country, which cuts through a protected forest and Unesco world heritage site. The Polish border guard said the barrier would measure 186km (115 miles), almost half the length of the border shared by the two countries, reach up to 5.5 metres (18ft) and cost €353m (£293m). It will be equipped with motion detectors and thermal cameras.  Poland has accused Belarus’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, of deliberately provoking a new refugee crisis in Europe by organising the movement of people from the Middle East to Minsk and promising them a safe passage to the EU in revenge for the sanctions Brussels has imposed on his authoritarian regime. Thousands of asylum seekers, mainly from Syria, Iraqi Kurdistan and Afghanistan, were caught attempting to cross the frontier and were violently pushed back to Belarus by Poland’s border guards, and hundreds of families were trapped in the forest between the two countries in the midst of a frigid winter. At least 19 people have died since the beginning of the border standoff between Poland and Belarus. Most of them died of exposure to freezing temperatures. The humanitarian emergency reached its peak in November when Belarusian authorities escorted thousands of asylum seekers to the Polish border. Dozens of refugees told the Guardian how Belarusian troops gathered groups of up to 50 people and cut the barbed wire with shears to allow them to cross. “The construction of the barrier on the Polish-Belarusian border has started,” said a statement from the Polish border guard on Twitter. “It is the largest construction investment in the history of the border guard.” The cost is approximately 10 times the whole budget of Poland’s migration department this year. The news has raised human rights concerns among aid workers and charities worried that refugees fleeing conflicts and starvation will not be able to apply for asylum, and there are also environmental concerns. “This money could be used to build and launch [an] effective and humane migration, reception and asylum policy,” said a spokesperson for Ocalenie Foundation, which supports refugees living in Poland. “No wall in the history of the world stopped migration. Also, it would be a disaster for the nature in Białowieża area.” The Białowieża forest world heritage site, on the border between Poland and Belarus, is an immense range of primary forest including conifers and broadleaved trees. It is home to the largest population of European bison. Anna Alboth, of Minority Rights Group and a member of Grupa Granica, a Polish network of NGOs monitoring the situation on the border, said: “Walls are dividing, not protecting. The decision about building such a wall on the Polish-Belarusian border is not only lawless but also brings a risk of irreversible harm to the environment, in one of the most rich natural places of Poland and the whole of Europe. “Instead of spending money on walls and private companies, it should be spending on developing a migration policy that prioritises human rights and safety of the people on the move, local people, animals and nature.” A border guard spokesperson, Anna Michalska, told Poland’s PAP news agency that the “intention is for the damage to be as small as possible”. She said: “Tree felling will be limited to the minimum required. The wall itself will be built along the border road.” Contractors would only make use of existing roads, she said. Last year Warsaw’s rightwing government quadrupled the presence of border guards and military personnel in the area, creating a two-mile deep militarised zone, and built a razor-wire fence, in a show of force unknown in the country since the end of the cold war. Dozens of checkpoints were placed along the perimeter of the so-called red zone, which is inaccessible to aid workers and journalists. Last week Poland’s supreme court condemned the government for preventing reporters from accessing the area. Judges in Warsaw said the ban was incompatible with Polish law and that “there is no justification for admitting that this particular professional group represents a threat to steps taken”.",News/World news,Poland starts building wall through protected forest at Belarus border,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/27/poland-starts-building-wall-through-protected-forest-at-belarus-border
1/28/2022,"Humanitarian agencies have mounted an emergency response across southern Africa this week as the death toll from tropical Storm Ana reached 70. Officials reported that at least 41 people had been killed in Madagascar, 18 in Mozambique and 11 in Malawi. The EU’s aid agency Echo said on Thursday that at least 350,000 people have been affected across the three countries, including more than 80,000 displaced from their homes. Flooding has cut off roads and damaged power and water supplies.  The storm passed over Zimbabwe, but no deaths have been reported. Aid agencies have set up dozens of temporary sites to house those made homeless. Unicef said it is deploying staff to set up temporary learning centres as well as distribute food, medicine and water purification tablets in Mozambique. The agency said 12 health facilities and 137 schools had been damaged by the storm in Mozambique, forcing more than 27,000 children out of school. It estimated $3.5m (£2.6m) was needed to respond to the storm. A spokesperson for the World Food Programme said the agency had been preparing for this year’s cyclone season when the storm hit the region on Monday. “Storm Ana has brought heavy rains and flooding in Madagascar, Mozambique and Malawi. Agricultural land, key infrastructure and houses have been damaged, and lives and livelihoods lost,” said the spokesperson. “Southern African countries have been repeatedly struck by severe storms and cyclones in recent years that have impacted food security, destroyed livelihoods and displaced large numbers of people.” In 2019, Cyclone Idai caused devastation across Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, affecting millions of people. The Madagascar Red Cross Society said flooding, which was worse in slum areas and for more fragile homes made with earth walls and thatched roofs, had destroyed many people’s food stocks. Cristina Uamusse, secretary general of the Mozambican Red Cross Society, said early action taken to pre-empt the storms had helped limit the damage. “We have been working with communities for many years and have seen what a significant difference pre-positioned stock movement from provinces to districts make on our response time to community needs,” she said. WaterAid said it is concerned about the spread of disease if water sources have been contaminated by flooding. Malawi’s government has declared a state of natural disaster after electricity cuts caused by flooding at power stations. “Our priority now is restoring power to health establishments, water treatment distribution systems, and schools,” the national power utility said in a statement. Maria Luisa Fornara, the Unicef representative in Mozambique, said: “This latest storm to hit Mozambique is a blunt reminder that the climate crisis is very much a reality and children are most impacted by climate-related severe weather events.” Unicef said Mozambique has faced eight tropical storms since 2016.",News/Global development,Aid agencies scale up Storm Ana response amid floods and rising death toll,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/27/southern-africa-storm-ana-aid-agencies-floods-death-toll-madagascar-malawi-mozambique
1/28/2022,"Although wearing a face mask was no longer a legal requirement, many travellers and shoppers in London and Birmingham chose to continue covering up as they went about their morning business. Commuters at Birmingham New Street committed to widespread mask-wearing, with almost half still wearing them around the station and many saying they would put one on when they got on a train.  Of 100 people passing through the station entrance on Thursday morning, 48 were wearing masks, with a variety of different reasons for doing so – on the day not wearing one stopped being an offence in England. “I think I’ll keep wearing one for the foreseeable. The number of colds and coughs I’ve had over the past couple of years has gone right down, and wearing a mask is not that bad,” said salesman Stuart Whitman, 50. “I’m not as worried about Covid any more, I feel like we’re on the way out, but I find it a lot healthier to wear a mask. At this time of year there are loads of germs going round with the kids going back to school, and I like not having a cold.” But there were also many people who were relieved to be ditching face coverings. “I’m no longer wearing one. Everyone should be vaccinated and we’ve got to live with it now. It’s not going to go away. We can’t keep restricting our lives for every strain of coronavirus,” said 57-year-old Steve Horne. “It’s up to everyone what they want to do now. But I’m fully vaccinated so I’m led to believe I’m protected.” In the capital, mayor Sadiq Khan has said Londoners must keep donning their masks on public transport, and in Waterloo train station only a handful of people were spotted flouting the rules. Marilia Perry, originally from Leeds, said mask wearing was still important to her and that she continued to work from home. She recently got her booster jab but said she “would like to respect others who might not have had all their vaccinations yet”. Walking by the South Bank, Marie Braniff-Hudson, 66 and her husband, David Hudson 65, wore their masks outdoors, and said their expat life in Singapore, where rules were much stricter, has made them accustomed to wearing masks. “In Singapore, you would be fined if you are not wearing a mask,” said Hudson. Braniff-Hudson said the couple were shocked when they saw people not wearing them in England. “We now have an Asian frame of mind,” she said. With advice to work from home now eased, Transport for London reported a small uptick in travellers on Thursday. Up to 10am, 1.2 million people had taken the tube – up 9% compared to last week, but still only half of pre-pandemic levels. City of London workers were slowly returning to the office. About 120,000 commuters used connecting tube stops on Thursday morning, a 12% increase compared with last Thursday. Shops revealed a similar mask-wearing majority to public transport. When the Guardian visited the Charing Cross branch of Waterstones, which no longer had posters on mask requirements, all of the nine shoppers wore face coverings. Only one of the 10 customers in the Tesco opposite Trafalgar Square was maskless. In the Birmingham branch of variety store Flying Tiger, seven out of 10 customers were wearing masks, and in Foyles bookshop every customer was wearing one. But around the corner in Tesco Express numbers were much lower – there was one mask-wearer to six unmasked. Many cited high case numbers as one of the main reasons why they were still choosing to wear a face covering. “Coronavirus hasn’t gone away, it’s still very much in evidence. We’ve had our vaccinations but it doesn’t stop you getting it,” said 74-year-old Shelia Roberts, who had travelled to Birmingham for the day from her home on the outskirts of Redditch. “We’re obviously of the senior variety, so for us it’s safer to continue wearing them in certain places. We’re going to the Hippodrome theatre, so we’ll almost certainly wear them in there. If I go to the supermarket, I always wear it and I’ll continue to.” “You’ve got to use your own common sense, and if I feel I want to wear them for the rest of my life then it’s up to me,” added her friend, 71-year-old Glenda Smith. “What’s the harm in a little bit of fabric to keep you well?”",News/UK news,‘I’ll wear one for the forseeable’: masks abound despite England rule change,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/27/ill-wear-one-for-the-forseeable-masks-abound-despite-england-rule-change
1/28/2022,"On Thursday’s Late Show, Stephen Colbert weighed in on sky-high tensions over Russia’s massing of troops on the border with Ukraine. “So the world’s two greatest nuclear powers are toe-to-toe in a high-stakes staring contest, but not everyone is pulling for our guy,” he said, citing a new poll which found 62% of Republicans think Putin is a “stronger leader” than Biden.  “What is wrong with you? Stop rooting for the other team!” he marveled. “Haven’t you seen Rocky IV, From Russia With Love, Air Force One, Rambo First Blood Part II, Golden Eye, The Hunt for Red October? Come on! “I’m not sure what the Republican criterion for toughness is. It is true that Biden hasn’t murdered anyone with a cup of tea laced with polonium, a noose, point-blank shootings or by chucking them out of windows,” he continued, citing several examples of the Kremlin killing dissidents. “The only way Joe’s gonna kill you is by repeatedly telling the same story.” Nevertheless, Republicans are “crushing hard” on Putin, Colbert concluded, pointing to a clip from Fox & Friends in which host Brian Kilmeade said, based on a poll in which six out of 10 Americans thought Biden was likable, “give us a strong leader who’s a little less likable”. “Republican daddy issues are going to kill us all,” Colbert mused. It’s probably not fun having people always yell “Retire, bitch!” at you. Justice Breyer finally got the hint. pic.twitter.com/Y6P2wjuBn6 On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah reacted to news that Stephen Breyer will retire from the supreme court. “Democrats have been relentlessly pestering Breyer to step down so that they can replace him before Mitch McConnell comes back into power and makes a rule that all supreme court justices have to have been platinum QAnon members in the past,” Noah noted. “Honestly, no one should be surprised by this news, right?” he continued. “It probably isn’t fun being hounded all day by people screaming at you to retire. “Think about it, everywhere this guy goes, people are telling him he should be retiring. He’s probably in line at the grocery store and people are like ‘retire, bitch!’ He’s at Starbucks, the name on the cup is ‘Retire Bitch.’” While many Democrats are relieved at the 83-year-old justice’s retirement, Noah was skeptical. “I feel like the only winner here will be Mitch McConnell,” he said. “Maybe I’m just scarred. Because even though the Republicans don’t control the Senate, don’t be shocked when Mitch still makes it happen. “He’s just going to come out like, ‘It’s a longstanding Senate tradition that we cannot confirm a supreme court justice in a year when there’s a new season of Ozark on Netflix.’” On Late Night, Seth Meyers decried the “fake controversy” over Biden calling the Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy a “stupid son of a bitch” on an apparent hot mic after Doocy asked a vacuous question about inflation at a White House press conference. “Look, ideally the president would not lob insults at anyone, including reporters, but if we’re being honest, you know, it was kind of a stupid question,” said Meyers. “Does Biden think inflation is a political liability? What is he supposed to say? ‘No, I think it’s good that gas and ground beef are more expensive! I’m gonna cruise to re-election on the strength of Subway’s $6 footlong.’” Biden later apologized to Doocy and told him over the phone that “it’s not personal, pal”. “Which does strike me as kind of a non-apology apology,” Meyers mused. “You called him a stupid son of a bitch. If it wasn’t personal then what was it? Business?” And just in case, “let’s just get the false equivalency out of the way,” he added. “No, this isn’t even remotely like Trump, who repeatedly whipped his crazed fans into a frenzy by hurling insults at reporters and calling them the enemy of the people.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recalled a time when “people from both sides of the aisle come together to say Peter Doocy is stupid”, such as the late John McCain, a GOP senator from Arizona who once replied to Doocy, “why would you say something that stupid?” Kimmel also blasted Eric Trump, who appeared on Fox News – “the closest he can get to a Zoom with his dad” – to complain about Biden not being “present” as president. “My father sat there 24 hours a day and fought for the United States’ best interests,” he claimed. “Well, I agree with the sat there 24 hours a day part,” Kimmel retorted, “but you forgot to mention: on the toilet, pleasuring himself to Lou Dobbs. You left the key part out!” And he suggested Biden, who has promised to nominate a black woman to the supreme court, pick Anita Hill to replace Breyer. “How good would that be?” he said. “She marches in, sits on the bench right next to Clarence [Thomas], cracks open a can of Coke.

1/28/2022,"Efforts to increase uptake of Covid jabs in the UK should be concentrated on reducing the number of unvaccinated people rather than booster jabs, a leading expert has said. As Omicron spread rapidly around the country towards the end of 2021, health advisers and government ministers stressed that two doses “are not enough” to protect against the new variant, urging those eligible to take up a booster dose as soon as possible.  The message hit home: in an attempt to avert another dismal Christmas and protect their loved ones people dashed to get jabbed, with 968,665 booster or third vaccinations reported on 21 December alone. But uptake subsequently fell dramatically, with booster doses now bobbing about 50,000 a day. Now a leading vaccine expert has said the focus should be placed on reducing the numbers of those who have yet to have even their first jab. “I think the booster programme might have reached saturation and [it is] best to concentrate on those who had no vaccine at all – as their chance of dying is 11 times higher than vaccinated folks,” said Prof Beate Kampmann, director of the vaccine centre at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. When the booster slowdown first became apparent, the government’s vaccine minister, Maggie Throup said the Christmas break and public holidays were key factors. But the ongoing slump suggests there is more at play. Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist at Swansea University, said one reason could be that people needed to wait 28 days after testing positive for Covid before they could have a booster. “At the start of January, cases were astronomically high, with Omicron at its peak, so we might in theory see an increase in booster uptake now, as more people become eligible,” he said. But he said hesitancy or complacency around booster jabs might also play a role, adding his own research had found many people have “variant fatigue” – the view that Omicron is just another variant and it is just time to get on with life. “This has been compounded by a common perception that Omicron is a ‘milder’ variant,” Williams said, adding that, in fact, it is in large part thanks to vaccinations, including boosters, that Omicron has not lead to as many hospitalisations as initially feared. Williams suggested falling levels of infection might also reduce the sense of urgency around getting boosted – despite boosters being one of the factors behind the decline. But Kampmann said another reason was the perception of vaccine effectiveness. “I suspect it all has to do with people feeling less confident that the vaccine is going to protect them from Omicron infection, and the observation that despite vaccination people still had contracted this variant,” she said, adding people forget why the booster programme existed. “Primarily [it is] to keep individuals out of hospital and protecting those who are the most vulnerable from progressing to severe disease. And for that the booster is definitely needed and has been shown to work very well,” she said. The latest figures from the UK Health Security Agency reveal more than 90% of those aged 70 and over in England have now had a booster. While Williams said he agreed a priority should be to continue to attempt to engage and encourage the unvaccinated to get vaccinated, particularly those who are vulnerable, he added boosters remained important, noting while the jabs did not fully prevent transmission, they helped. “To keep rates and illness going down, booster uptake is still needed,” he said. While efforts are to understand the reasons for hesitancy in some communities and to counter misinformation are needed to encourage uptake of all Covid jabs, Williams said there was another issue to tackle to increase booster uptake. “For some there might be a bit of a conflict or confusion between the message that boosters are important to help protect against the ongoing threat posed by Omicron, and the message that is sent out by the quite sudden removal of pretty much all policy protections and the reduction of the self-isolation period, coupled with the message of ‘getting on with it’,” he said. Not for the first time in the pandemic, the message appears to be that when it comes to jabs, communication is key.",News/World news,"UK Covid efforts should target unvaccinated, says expert",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/27/uk-covid-efforts-should-target-unvaccinated-says-expert
1/28/2022,"Donny van de Beek’s club career statistics: Ajax (2015-20), 41 goals, 34 assists, 175 appearances – 90 in central midfield, 68 attacking midfield, 14 defensive midfield, one wide left and two in the final moments. Manchester United (2020-), two goals, two assists, 50 appearances, 18 in central midfield, 14 attacking midfield, three defensive midfield, three wide left and 12 too short to matter. This cliff-face fall-off in numbers between Van de Beek’s first and current clubs point to the mysterious case of a Dutch-schooled Netherlands first-choice with Champions League quarter- and semi-final goals on his CV who joined United and instantly became player non grata.  It is hard to comprehend what happened to leave the 24-year-old available as a winter-window loanee; why, when United have failed to acquire an elite-level schemer since Michael Carrick signed in July 2006, Van de Beek has not had a concerted run to discover whether he might be good enough. A misconception has developed that Van de Beek is solely a No 10, not an 8 or 6. The logic runs that having to compete with United’s incumbent trequartista and de facto leader, Bruno Fernandes, is the reason why his career has been mothballed. This myth is busted by the appearance stats above (the majority come in midfield), by how Fernandes is operating as an 8 in Ralf Rangnick’s 4-3-3 (if the Portuguese can, Van de Beek can) and by Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s appraisal of the player when signing him in September 2020. “His ability to see space, time his movements and read the game will really complement the qualities that we have in midfield,” said United’s then manager. Quality of the highest echelon, though, is not associated with a department that, since Carrick’s pomp ended about a decade ago, has featured the modest talents of Marouane Fellaini, Morgan Schneiderlin, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Ander Herrera. When Van de Beek took the No 34 shirt for the club his competitors were Nemanja Matic, Fred, Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay. Pogba and McTominay may have an argument for selection ahead of Van de Beek but each can be erratic and they have suffered sufficient injuries for the Dutchman to have enjoyed more than a solitary run of two consecutive appearances – in November 2020, versus Istanbul Basaksehir and Southampton. On debut as a 67th-minute substitute two months before, Van de Beek scored in a 3-1 loss at Crystal Palace but by the close of his first season there had been only 15 starts in 36 appearances with a total of 1,460 minutes, and two assists. This term the numbers are four starts in 14, the second of his two United goals – in the 4-1 defeat at Watford that caused Solskjær’s sacking – and no assists. The downward graph is a puzzle. If in the past year and a half United had been a formidable, trophy-winning force whose side selected itself this would be an explanation. United are not. Solskjær piloted them to last season’s Premier League runners-up spot, then saw his team bomb in May’s Europa League final against Villarreal. A shootout defeat followed a 1-1 draw in which Solskjær deployed four substitutes but in two hours of play did not call on Van de Beek, who had 20 minutes’ experience of the showpiece as a replacement when Ajax lost the 2017 edition to United. Solskjær took off both central midfielders – Pogba and McTominay – and preferred Dan James (now at Leeds) and the unreliable Fred. The current campaign threatens to be far poorer. In the autumn, United descended into a rabble who lost a fourth manager since May 2013 – Solskjær – and after the winter break they will stand fourth, 19 points (with a game in hand) behind Manchester City. Their Champions League last-16 tie with Atlético Madrid starts next month but only a fantasist would bet on a fourth competition triumph. The FA Cup – Friday-week’s fourth-round visitors are Middlesbrough – may end the four-year trophy drought but even if so 2021-22 will be the latest muddled year in United’s annals. Van de Beek could assess all this and wonder what he has done to deserve his season and a half in the cold. The view from the training ground is that unlike, say, James, Van de Beek is good enough, at least, to be allowed a fair chance. It adds to the conundrum of his low status. Maybe a clue can be found in Jadon Sancho’s similar experience. The forward is United’s third-highest transfer (£73m) and is struggling for regular game time in his first season despite being pursued by Solskjær across two summers. Or in Jesse Lingard, whose loan to West Ham last season was impressive enough to get him into England’s provisional Euro 2020 squad but who has hardly been given a kick this season. Van de Beek, too, may be suffering from odd selection choices that are a function of the instability at the club. On signing, Van de Beek said: “Having spoken to the manager about his vision, I cannot wait to be a part of that.” He is still waiting. A ray of hope for Van de Beek is how United will not sell him this month so that whoever is in charge next season can make their own judgment. Rangnick himself is an outsider for the post. But given he is content for Van de Beek to be loaned, the player may hope for a change of luck when United make the appointment. He could certainly do with one.",Sport/Football,"The mystery of Donny van de Beek, Manchester United’s player non grata",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/27/donny-van-de-beek-manchester-united-player-non-grata-available-loan
1/28/2022,"Global oil prices are at their highest levels since 2014 with Brent crude, one widely cited gauge, topping US$90 (A$127) a barrel on Wednesday. Tension over a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine is obviously one factor stoking energy costs.  But what do the higher prices mean for Australians and is there much we can do about it? As the ABS noted last week when releasing December quarter consumer price index data, automotive fuel was “the most significant” contributor to the 3.5% annual inflation rate. Fuel prices have risen for six quarters in a row, with the 32.3% annual increase in 2021 the biggest since 1990. The national average price during the latest quarter also reached a record $1.64 a litre for unleaded petrol, the ABS said. Perhaps not surprisingly for an internationally traded commodity that underpins economies – and that nations have gone to war over – the agency says fuel has often been a major contributor to price changes. And sometimes, it’s a drop. At one point early in the Covid pandemic, oil prices were briefly negative, but nobody reported service stations in Australia paying motorists to take away their petrol. Still, Australians would be right to wonder how local fuel prices are set. Despite scary newspaper headlines warning prices are likely to remain sky-high for a while, the average fuel cost in most capital cities has actually been on the slide in the past week or so. That, at least, is according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Competition, which has copped criticism over the years for not finding consistent price collusion by service stations. By their measure, average petrol prices peaked in Sydney more than a week ago at just under $1.80 a litre, and are now a few cents cheaper. In Melbourne, they peaked two weeks ago, and are down about 10 cents a litre to $1.63 a litre. Perth has posted a drop of more than 20 cents a litre since mid-January with petrol recently selling for just over $1.55. “It’s certainly the case that they’re falling slowly in most of the capital cities that have price cycles,” Peter Khoury, a spokesperson for NRMA in NSW, says. Khoury says how those cycles turn – and why prices can vary across suburbs by 30 cents or more on the same day for essentially the same product – can defy logic. “Nowhere else on earth has this price cycle that we have in those capital cities,” he says. “It’s a very bizarre situation where we know [global] oil prices are going up but in a number of those capital cities, prices are currently falling because of the price cycle.” Those recent falls aren’t likely to last, though, so now might be a good time to fill up. Since many drivers would do that every week or so, there’s little need for a prompt. “When [prices] go back up, they’ll go back up to near-record highs,” Khoury predicts. Darwin and Hobart are mysteriously left out of those cycles, as are most regional areas. Big distances preclude the option for many in remote areas of shopping around for cheaper prices. Catherine Birch, a senior economist with ANZ, says regional folk typically devote a larger chunk of their income to fuel bills, as do low- to middle-income households. The effect of rising prices tends to get magnified for them. “There’s no other way to get around than driving, so a lot of these people are more exposed than people who live in the cities, who can switch to public transport,” she says. Threat of Russian aggression towards Ukraine clearly adds to uncertainty about peace in general and energy prices in particular. Russia supplies about a third of Europe’s gas and so there’s a bit of a scramble to secure energy, not least because winter can bring sudden spikes in orders from households and businesses seeking heat. Oil and gas prices tend to move in step. But, as Birch’s ANZ colleagues note, demand was already on the rise as economies rebounding from Covid lockdown ran up against constraints on supply. Amin Nasser, head on Saudi Arabia’s Aramco – the world’s biggest oil producer – has lately joined those warning that suppliers have been under-investing in production. Opec members such as Nigeria have struggled to meet increased quota levels, while the US has been lately topping up its strategic crude oil stockpiles. As noted last week, investors tend not to be great prophets of geopolitical strife. That said, economists like Birch are generally sanguine about the wider economic implications of fuel prices remaining high. Fuel prices have tended to increase faster than average goods, as noted above, but the average household expenditure on fuel is not huge. According to the ABS’s 2015-16 Household Expenditure Survey, on average, Australians spent approximately $2,300 on automotive fuel each year. While somewhat dated now, that outlay made up just 3.3% of a CPI basket. Even with higher bowser prices, the fundamentals of spending and the outlook more generally are “actually looking quite strong”, Birch says. Consumers have socked away $200bn in savings and Australia’s jobless rate is at a 13-year low of just 4.2%, leaving them relatively well-poised to absorb higher fuel bills. Nor will the central bank be overly concerned – unless of course there’s a war – when its board meets next Tuesday for the first time in 2022. “One of the questions RBA will be asking itself is, ‘will lifting rates earlier, do anything to address oil price inflation?’” Birch says. “I think on the whole the answer is going to be ‘no’, really.” For those who can afford it, though, there is one way to dodge petrol price volatility. “Over the longer term higher oil prices could also help accelerate the move away from oil” towards electric vehicles, she says. “If we can … get the take-up in Australia rising more quickly, that would lower people’s exposure to oil and oil prices.”",News/Business,Australia’s petrol prices: why now might be a good time to fill up as experts anticipate new highs,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/28/australias-petrol-prices-why-now-might-be-a-good-time-to-fill-up-as-experts-anticipate-new-highs
1/28/2022,"I am 53 and I don’t know what I want to do with my life. Every job and every relationship I’ve ever had have been initiated by the other party. I’ve never made a friend outside of the formal structure of work or school. I haven’t developed any real passions or maintained any hobbies. I was content for a while to be defined by my job and my family, but while the job is fine and pays amazingly well it is not a vocation. My marriage ended years ago and my kids are almost adults. I want to feel as though there was a purpose and a direction to all of this. I want to be able to say that I love my life. How do I begin, starting from here?  Eleanor says: I think you’re asking about something that hums in the centre of a lot of people, especially in midlife, and especially after years in a pandemic. The ties that connect us to what we know and love seem to grow stretched and slack – we want to feel tethered again, embedded, like it would matter if we floated away. The trouble is, it’s difficult to find purpose and contentment by running directly at them. In fact, the more preoccupied we are with the goal of feeling fulfilled, the less likely we are to accomplish it. We can start to imagine “true happiness” as something mythical and lofty, a condition in which we never feel lonely or lost, and in chasing that ideal we overlook the small glimmers of laughter or quiet moments of repose in which genuine happiness actually lives. Tomes have been written about how to feel purpose and joy. You could have a lot of fun reading them and coming up with your own personal recipe, but I think a good starting mission is: insist on making your life as nourishing as you can and then find equilibrium with the remainder. Both parts of that mission are hard. The first is hard because it requires grit and optimism when you might feel low on both. You write you’ve struggled to make and keep friends or hobbies. This is about insisting that can change; that the path you’ve been on has no authority to dictate where you go next. Things do change – one of my biggest role models couldn’t swim a lap as an adult and 10 years later swims kilometres in the ocean every week. But they change because you keep turning up. Reach out to the people you used to be close to from work and school; think of whatever made you feel most alive as a kid and go back to it in some small way; join a community organisation that makes other people’s lives better and forces you to become part of a collective. The annoying part is you have to actually do all those things, even when you don’t want to, and even when it feels like they’re not “working”. The goal isn’t to do them until they make you feel life has a point – it’s to populate life with enough experiences and people that happiness creeps in between them, almost while you’re not looking. That’s what gets you to part two; finding equilibrium with the remainder. Even when we’ve put serious elbow grease into making a life we’re proud of, there will be moments of loneliness and grief and worry. They may even be frequent. It can be tempting then to abandon the changes we’ve made, thinking “why bother?” – as though the things we fill our life with have betrayed us if we still don’t feel full. Resist that temptation as much as you can. Pain is an inevitable part of living; by staying engaged with the world and other people we can come to see that feeling as a companion to joy instead of a threat. You write that you want to feel there “was” a purpose to your life, but a past tense isn’t in order yet. Start with a change of tense; ask what purpose could there be?

1/28/2022,"Covid is “out of control” in central Australia, representing a “catastrophic failure” by the Northern Territory government to carry out its own emergency plans, according to the three biggest Aboriginal organisations in the NT. The groups have accused the NT government of failing to adequately carry out emergency plans that had been made “well in advance” of the current outbreak.  “Many of the issues we are facing were foreseen, and plans made to address them. But there has been a catastrophic failure by government to discharge its responsibility to all Northern Territory residents by implementing these plans in Central Australia,” they wrote in a scathing letter to the NT chief minister, Michael Gunner. The Central Land Council, Congress Aboriginal Health Service and the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory (AMSANT) – representing thousands of traditional owners, as well as the territory’s frontline medical services – demanded Gunner “act urgently” to lock down central Australia. “This is our last chance,” they said. “We have been advocating continuously for firm action to slow the outbreak since it began in the early days of 2022. However, our requests have been ignored, or action taken too late or on too small a scale to make a real difference. “There has been a significant failure by government agencies in Central Australia to put into practice the plans agreed with your government before the outbreak. This has directly led to Covid spreading out of control in the Aboriginal communities of Central Australia and beyond,” the letter said. “This is our last chance to flatten the curve of new infections and hospitalisations and save lives that will otherwise be lost.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The groups outlined a series of public health failures they say have occurred including slow contact tracing, the belated introduction of a mask mandate, and the failure to remove positive cases from crowded households. “When positive cases were located in crowded households, they were left at home for more than 48 hours, by which time the virus had spread within and between households, and then to other town camps and houses,” they said. “This was in contravention of all agreed plans to remove positive cases immediately from households where they were unable to safely self isolate.” On Friday, Guardian Australia reported the case of a resident of the remote community of Yuendumu, who was pleading with the Northern Territory government to provide a local quarantine facility after her Covid-positive elderly relative was forced to sleep outside on the veranda and spend three days under a tree in order to safely isolate from the rest of the family. Community groups in Yuendumu also expressed frustration that a group of people taken into quarantine were “unexpectedly” sent home last week and subsequently tested positive for Covid-19. The community members – who had been evacuated to the Alice Springs quarantine facility as close contacts – were flown home on 16 January and sent back to their homes. Local authorities said they had not been informed of their return. A number of the group were Covid-positive when tested by health workers in the following two days. Leaked minutes of the Yuendumu local emergency health response group – made up of NT police, health workers and key community organisations – expressed concern that the “urban model” of managing Covid at home was not working in the community. “It appears that the outbreak cannot be contained by using the tools (targeted testing) and practices (quarantine/lockout/living with Covid) in place. An approach that is not working for the community and more fit for an urban mainstream environment,” the minutes of the 17 January meeting said. The letter to Gunner called for an “immediate lockdown” in central Australia, “to stop the movement of people and flatten the curve of new infections and hospitalisations”, which they said would give them time to set up a rapid response team for Alice Springs and the remote communities in Central Australia. They have also asked for rapid antigen tests and N95 masks to be distributed. “We urge you to ignore those who say it is too difficult, too late, or too expensive, or that the Omicron variant of Covid is a mild disease and that we need not worry about it,” they said.",News/Australia news,"‘Catastrophic failure’: Covid out of control in the NT, say Aboriginal groups",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/28/catastrophic-failure-covid-out-of-control-in-the-nt-say-aboriginal-groups
1/28/2022,"Social media companies should commit to taking down unauthorised political material in agreed timeframes to combat misinformation in elections, according to the Australian electoral commissioner, Tom Rogers. At a briefing on the 2022 election on Thursday, Rogers said the Australian Electoral Commission still relies on social media companies to “do the right thing” but would push for a “detailed agreement” in future.  Rogers also warned that any misinformation about the result of the election “would be not only be disappointing [but] outrageous”, suggesting the AEC will take a hard line in the event of any baseless Trump-style claims of a stolen election. The AEC is preparing its biggest and most complex election yet, a $400m exercise that will employ more than 100,000 workers to help 17 million enrolled Australians to vote during a global pandemic. Rogers told reporters in Canberra that voters would face “larger wait times” at polling places due to Covid health measures including check-in QR codes and social distancing. The AEC is making vaccination a condition of employment for its temporary workers, but has no power to mandate vaccination for others, including party workers or volunteers who scrutinise the counting of ballots. The experience of mid-pandemic byelections in Eden Monaro and Groom suggests a huge growth in postal voting at the 2022 election, while prepoll voting has been trimmed from three to two weeks by legislative changes made before the pandemic. Depending on how close the election is, more postal votes could mean the AEC has to wait for the full 13-day period for ballots to be returned before declaring the result in more seats. Asked what would happen if sections of the community questioned the result, as occurred in the 2020 US presidential election, Rogers replied that Australia has one of the most transparent and fair election processes in the world. “If we see some of the stuff we’ve seen in overseas jurisdictions … that would be not only disappointing but frankly outrageous. “If there is that sort of outrageous misinformation … We’ll certainly defend the process and [we have] very broad powers to advise the public, parliament and the government on everything to do with the ballot.” Rogers said the AEC had no role “censoring anyone” and Australians have a “right to believe and say” things including “the Earth is flat”. Although it has no role in assessing the truth of political material, misleading voters about the process of voting is an offence, and the commission also takes a “fairly assertive stance on social media” by countering misleading claims, he said. AEC officials said that social media companies swiftly take down material that lacks a political authorisation declaring its source, but material that allegedly breaches social media companies’ policy can take longer to remove. Rogers said that the Electoral Council of Australia and New Zealand is working on a protocol with Digi, an industry group representing major search and social media companies, to include standards on take-down times. “In the long term we’ve got to get that in place … On the broader point about is there a detailed agreement, in the long term, my own view is there has to be, including very, very clear and timely standards for take-down,” he said.

1/28/2022,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that an author who hands in her manuscript must be in want of a good physiotherapist. After more than two years working on a book about Stoicism, my body had calcified around my laptop. My joints were always stiff and sore, sleep was unrefreshing and one shoulder had moved inches up towards my ear, as if I were perpetually holding a telephone receiver in the crook of my neck.  When I finally handed in my book, I decided to begin to heal and have a massage. But in the Melbourne CBD on a hot Sunday, it appeared that all my old haunts had shut – victims perhaps of long lockdowns. After an hour of hobbling through the city, I came across a semi-deserted shopping mall (a tailor, nail bar, cheap tax return place, all shut or abandoned). At the back was a small red light, a faded picture of a bare back and a brochure stuck to the window. Could this be the place to fix me? The door was unlocked, so I stepped in, activating a low-energy buzzer. Inside it looked like a disused storeroom. All the lights were off. There was a black vinyl couch that had been slashed in parts (yellow foam spewing out) and a pallet of bottled water on the ground. But otherwise it looked abandoned. Then, from the gloom at the back of the shop, a woman I would later know as Deane came out to greet me. Deane would have been in her 50s with orange lipstick, purple Crocs and a blue apron with a wide pocket, like the women in tuck shops used to wear to carry stuff like spare change, raffle tickets, pens and a spanner. I explained my problem to Deane, “mid-back issues, in the wrong chair, on a small computer, two and a half years!” and bent in half, walking in circles for a bit, a pantomime grimace on my face. Deane said nothing but took out a large knife from her apron. Woah! I saw the flash of the blade as she suddenly advanced towards me, before bending at the waist, plunging the knife into the pallet of water and stabbing furiously at the plastic. Handing me a hot bottle of water from the pallet, she commanded: “Drink this!” “But it’s too hot,” I didn’t say. I drank the unrefreshing beverage and enjoyed it the way someone dying of thirst would enjoy drinking seawater. Deane promised to fix my back, as she led me to a small partition towards the back of the shop. On the walls were posters saying the business offered no sexual services – which was fair enough – but also another poster saying that if any of the staff offered sexual services or asked for money for sex, clients were to contact the owner of the business on this number and report them. Huh? There was not even a ceiling fan to stir the warm air, and as I lay down on the plastic table that was covered in sheeting used to protect furniture, I worried that my sweat would create a powerful adhesive and result in skin loss when I detached. I also wondered about the circumstances surrounding the poster. What had gone down? Ten minutes passed. I felt vulnerable under the tiny towel. Then a door opened. I recognised Deane from her pair of Crocs. Then … WHACK – I involuntarily yelped. It was as if Deane had hit me with a club. WHACK. “Argh … !” WHACK. Deane must have had an implement – no human hand could be that strong. She hit me again, even harder this time, and I protested. “That hurts! It’s sore there.” Deane agreed. “Yes, it’s very sore there,” before striking me again with the club. Suddenly the Crocs disappeared. I heard a grunt and felt the table buckle. What? Deane was up there with me. Why? Oh no! No! Deane’s knees were either side of me so she could use her full body weight to press into my upper back. Argh! Deane was giving it her all – pounding me in the middle of my back, tenderising me like a steak. I too was making strange grunting sounds. I worried my nose might break, pressing it so hard against the table. WHACK! WHACK! I could see what Deane was straining for – the crack of the middle back as the errant vertebrae popped into shape. The crack never came and eventually Deane dismounted. Before I’d had time to recover, Deane had thrown a bucket of oil over me. There was so much oil that she had trouble gripping the club, so for a short while it felt like a normal (albeit extremely oily) massage. That is, until she started working on my head. By this stage I had been turned around but Deane had thrown some sort of hood over my eyes, so I couldn’t see what was happening. But it felt like Deane was raking my scalp with an extremely powerful, possibly motorised implement. This didn’t feel like the touch of a normal human hand – this was the touch of a CLAW. I tried to recall whether Deane had long, talon-like nails (I concluded no, since she would have opened the pallet of water with her fingers). The scratching continued, and I wondered – how is this helping my back? I also wondered if my scalp was bleeding. I felt a trickle of something down my forehead, but it could have been sweat or … the oil? Deane did other confusing things: washed my feet with detergent, pulled my hair, pumped her hands on my chest like she was giving CPR. But the strangest was when she attacked my upper ear lobes – a place no one had paid much attention to before, and proceeded to strenuously knead and tug at the cartilage, like she was wanting to debone my ears. My sore back asked: What about me? Losing only a small amount of skin getting off the plastic sheeting, I hobbled out of the room, feeling beaten up and raw. Deane was nowhere to be seen. “Goodbye and thank you!” I called out into the darkened shop. It sounded like a sob. Throughout the night, each part of my body done over by the claw hammer of Deane took turns in throbbing with pain. The next day I was still hobbling, but in the manner of someone with cracked ribs and a bruised back. It was impossible to tell whether the infliction of the second injury had cured the original complaint.",Opinion/Opinion,Did I just pay someone to bash me up?

1/28/2022,"A re-elected Coalition would pour $1bn into Great Barrier Reef conservation projects over the next decade, the government says, just months after campaigning to prevent the reef being listed as “in danger” by the world heritage committee. The announcement, to be made by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, in north Queensland on Friday, comes a fortnight after Labor pledged $163m to protect the natural wonder. It highlights the reef as a key election fight in the Cairns electorate of Leichhardt.  The funding pledge arrives just days before Australia is due to send a report to Unesco about the state of the reef and its plans to protect it, before a critical meeting of the world heritage committee scheduled for July in Russia. Morrison said: “Funding will support scientists, farmers and traditional owners, backing in the very latest marine science while building resilience and reducing threats from pollution in our oceans, and predators such as the crown-of-thorns starfish.” Billed by the government as the “single largest investment” in the reef, the nine-year investment includes more than half a billion dollars for water quality, covering work on erosion, land condition, and reducing runoff of pesticides and nutrients. Another $253m will specifically address reef management and conservation, including work from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to combat crown-of-thorns starfish and prevent illegal fishing. Other funds will go towards reef health monitoring systems and research into reef resilience, and $74.4m will target habitat restoration, marine debris and species protection in programs led by traditional owners and community groups. The government said its proposal would almost double the number of areas to be protected from crown-of-thorns starfish, from 253 to 500 reefs, as well as encouraging local farmers to improve land management to reduce agricultural runoff into the ocean. “This is already the best managed reef in the world and today we take our commitment to a new level,” Morrison said, ahead of the official announcement in Cairns on Friday. The new policy is in addition to the government’s previously announced $2bn for the Reef 2050 plan. On top of its environmental benefits, Morrison painted the announcement as reinforcement for the 64,000 jobs and $6.4bn in tourism revenue supported by the reef. “From breakthrough science in coral seeding and restoration to improved water quality, the latest on water management and compliance systems, as well as the protection of native species, we are working across every aspect of the reef,” the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said. “Our farmers, tourism operators and fishers are our reef champions and we are supporting them through practical water- and land-based strategies that will contribute significantly to the health of the reef.” Ley and the government’s marine science experts agree the greatest threat to the world’s biggest coral reef system is climate change. The 2,300km reef has seen five mass bleaching events – in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020 – all caused by rising ocean temperatures driven by global heating. In December the government released the first revision in five years of its cornerstone reef conservation policy, the Reef 2050 plan. Conservationists said the plan was flawed because it was linked to the Morrison government’s inadequate greenhouse gas reduction targets. But they also said more funding and action was needed to improve water quality and address unsustainable and illegal fishing. Before Christmas, Labor said it would adopt a target to cut emissions by 43% by 2030 based on 2005 levels – slightly lower than the 45% target it took to the 2019 election but higher than the Morrison government’s target of a 26-28% cut. Last year UN science advisers recommended the reef be placed on the world heritage “in danger” list – the first time any site had been recommended for the listing primarily because of the impacts of climate change. After a strong protest from the federal government, including dispatching Ley on a private jet to personally lobby world heritage committee members around the world, the reef was not given the listing. But the committee asked Australia to submit a report by 1 February this year on the reef’s condition and the steps taken to protect it. A monitoring mission to be led by Unesco experts is also due to be held in the first half of this year before the world heritage committee considers again whether to put the reef on its list of sites “in danger” at its next meeting in July. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, committed $163m to the Great Barrier Reef during a trip to Cairns earlier this month. The opposition proposed $85m for “shovel-ready” reef protection projects, $63m to expand the Reef 2050 plan, and $15m for reef research. “We need to make sure that the reef is kept off the endangered list of the world heritage listing,” Albanese said.

1/28/2022,"Electricity demand hit a record low in several states during a milder-than-usual end to 2021, but average wholesale prices were up from a year earlier due to the higher cost of fossil fuels even as their share of the market dived. The December quarterly energy dynamics report by the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo), released on Friday, showed renewable energy set generation highs in the national electricity market (NEM).  Clean energy accounted for 34.9% of generation across the quarter, beating the 31.6% record set in the previous three months. At one point on 15 November renewables supplied 61.8%, surpassing the previous record of 61.4% set in the September quarter. NEM emissions fell to the lowest quarterly total on record at 28m tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent, 8% less than the previous quarterly low set a year earlier, Aemo said. Cooler, wetter climatic influences, driven in part by a La Niña event in the Pacific, curbed demand for air-conditioning. With more consumers supplying their own power from rooftop panels, average demand from the grid dropped to 19,876 megawatts – the least in a December quarter since 2005, Aemo said. More expensive fossil fuels played a central role in pushing up wholesale power prices in mainland states, particularly in Queensland and NSW. Power averaged $57 a megawatt hour, down 13% on the September quarter, but nearly a third higher than in the December quarter of 2020. “Increases in underlying traded prices for black coal and gas were likely to have been influences on offer price levels for some of these generators,” the report said. “The gap between prices in the northern NEM regions of Queensland and NSW and the southern regions persisted through the quarter, with prices in [the two states] averaging $45/MWh higher than those in Victoria and South Australia, the second largest differential after the June quarter of 2021.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Market prices were negative or zero for longer periods due to the increased use of rooftop solar and large-scale solar plants. In Victoria, spot price averages in the quarter were negative between 0925 hrs and 1420 hrs, while the overall average between 0800 hrs and 1630 hrs was just one cent per MWh. However, the global scramble for energy supplies late last year fed into local costs. Black coal-fired power plants and their gas equivalents were more often outbid by other sources as a result, even though repairs on ageing units actually increased their availability compared with a year earlier. During the quarter, the coal plants in Queensland and NSW averaged just over 10,000 MW of supply, the lowest during the October-December period since the market’s creation in 1998. Victoriaalso saw average use rates of its brown coal-fired plants decline. While the Morrison government had touted a gas-led recovery from Covid, the share of the fuel in the market was the lowest for the fourth quarter since 2003. In renewables-rich South Australia, the share was the least since the market’s start. Demand for grid power sank to a record low on Sunday 17 October, of 12,936MW at 1pm, almost 9% lower than the previous nadir set during the September quarter. That date and time was also NSW’s lowest for operational demand. Consumers there tapped the grid for only 4425MW, shaving about 5% off the previous record low set in 1999. Victoria’s new minimum demand of 2333 MW was set on 28 November – also at 1pm on a Sunday. That tally lopped about 6.6% off the previous low notched during the fourth quarter of 2020. Averaged over the quarter, NSW, Victoria and SA each posted record December quarter lows for grid demand. The spread of rooftop panels to total about 3200MW of capacity meant many consumer supplied their own needs even during a period marked by increased cloudiness and rain influenced by the La Nina. Even the maximum demand days were cut, such as in NSW where the 11,176MW top was the lowest in a December quarter since 2001. The trends in place at the end of 2021 look set to extend into this year. Futures prices for 2022 increased across all states, rising from an average of $57/MWh at the end of September to end the year at $73/MWh. “Participants’ outlooks [were] influenced by wholesale spot price trends, possible impact from long-term generation unit outages and closures, and potentially higher fuel cost expectations in 2022,” Aemo said.",News/Australia news,Higher cost of fossil fuels drives wholesale power prices up despite falling market share,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/28/higher-cost-of-fossil-fuels-drives-wholesale-power-prices-up-despite-falling-market-share
1/28/2022,"Only one of Australia’s 23 approved at-home rapid antigen tests explicitly states it will detect Omicron, as the Therapeutic Goods Administration carries out a review of all tests to check how they work with different variants of Covid-19. Most of the product disclosures for tests list their ability to detect Delta and other variants, but not Omicron. However, manufacturers are providing evidence to the TGA of their tests’ effectiveness as it comes to hand.  The United States Food and Drug Administration has warned that “early data suggests that antigen tests do detect the Omicron variant but may have reduced sensitivity”. The TGA has announced that variants caused by virus mutations could mean “test kits may no longer be able to detect the virus, leading to false negative results”. It has commissioned the Peter Doherty Institute to verify manufacturers’ claims about how good their tests are at detecting both the Delta and Omicron variants. It is also publishing a regularly updated list of those manufacturers who have provided evidence about their tests’ performance on its website. Dr Ashwin Swaminathan, an infectious diseases physician and senior lecturer at the Australian National University, said the performance of the tests with different variants was “a moving feast”. “[The TGA] are doing it in real time, releasing results as they go along,” he said. “It’s the role of the TGA to make it clear what a test can and can’t do. “In the context of governments buying up all these tests and distributing them to schools and workplaces and vulnerable people in society, where it’s a major part of our strategy going forward, we really need to know what the tests can do.” There have been ongoing supply shortages of the rapid antigen tests amid bickering over whether government demand has diverted supply from pharmacists. Dean Whiting, the chief executive of Pathology Technology Australia, said high-quality products identify the presence of the “nuclear capsid protein”. This is a “highly conserved” part of the virus which is much less likely to mutate, unlike the spike protein. It is the spike protein that has mutated to form new variants, and Omicron has many mutations, allowing it to dodge vaccine antibodies and making the booster jabs necessary. “All the manufacturers I know target the nuclear capsid protein,” Whiting said. PTA represents 70% of rapid antigen test suppliers. “All the good manufacturers have gone back and tested against Omicron to determine what effectiveness they have.” But he said that it can take months for tests to make it all the way down the supply chains into people’s hands, so changes made at the manufacturing level in terms of their instructions wouldn’t always keep up. “It’s always a good idea to look for brands you know and trust, because these are global brands that won’t risk their reputation on poor quality products,” he said. Swaminathan said rapid antigen tests should be used in conjunction with other information about a person’s infection risk. “It’s a really good diagnostic tool if it’s used in the right way in conjunction with common sense and other background information to prevent transmission and infection,” he said. “If we don’t use it in that context it could add to disruption.” For example, he said, if someone with Covid-like symptoms who had been exposed to an infected person and who had not been fully vaccinated returned a positive RAT, that would just confirm the diagnosis. But someone who had a very low risk of infection who got a positive test might have a false positive. In other situations people should understand that there were false negatives so they needed to retest or take a PCR test. With millions of tests being distributed, even a small proportion of wrong results would be significant, Swaminathan said. He has detailed in The Conversation ways to check how accurate your RAT result is. Guardian Australia has contacted the TGA for comment.",News/Australia news,Only one approved rapid test in Australia explicitly states it detects Omicron,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/28/only-one-approved-rapid-test-in-australia-explicitly-states-it-detects-omicron
1/28/2022,"Aged care workers are being “pushed to the edge” amid a worsening Omicron crisis, a lack of rapid tests, dire staffing shortages and effective bans on essential visitors, unions and advocates say. Data suggests Omicron had spread to more than 700 aged care homes across Australia last week, compounding existing frailties in the aged care system.  Providers have pleaded with the government for a surge workforce, including using the Australian Defence Force, and complained of dire shortages of rapid antigen tests which the commonwealth had promised to provide for residents, staff and essential visitors. Despite the pledge, more than half of aged care workers surveyed by the United Workers Union said they had not been given a rapid test by their workplace, instead having to source it themselves or use temperature checks as a substitute. Rapid tests are not being distributed proactively to prevent outbreaks but instead are being prioritised for sites with existing Omicron cases due to supply problems. Even then, the Guardian revealed this week that some providers in the grips of an outbreak were still waiting for weeks for shipments of rapid tests to arrive. Carolyn Smith, the aged care director of the UWU, said the lack of tests was placing huge amounts of stress on staff who feared taking Omicron into their workplaces. “It’s just an incredible emotional load on workers who are already pushed to the edge,” she said. “They are already really tired, overworked, struggling to get proper personal protective equipment – lots of them don’t have proper N95 masks.” The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation is also surveying its members and the preliminary results suggest a huge amount of stress on the sector. About 58% had experienced a Covid-19 outbreak, 20% were planning to leave their position within 12 months, and 40% had recently worked double shifts. “They’re going to work already completely anxious and overwhelmed because they know they’re going to have to hit the ground running, they’re so understaffed,” the ANMF acting federal director, Lori-Anne Sharp, said. “It was bad before. It’s been bad staffing-wise for a decade, and now with Omicron … the federal government was warned; their plans were inadequate.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The staffing capacity problems are being compounded by the restrictions on visitors, which are often due to a lack of rapid tests to screen them prior to entering facilities. The Guardian reported this week that essential visitors – partners in care, for example – were being blocked by some facilities that had mandated rapid tests but were unable to supply them due to commonwealth undersupply. One of those facilities, St Basil’s Homes in South Australia, said its hand was forced by unreliable supply from the federal government. Craig Gear, the chief executive of the Older Persons Advocacy Network, said the barrier to visitation was compounding the staffing crisis. Essential visitors were a crucial support to staff, helping to meet basic care needs for their family members, he said. “We can’t have that, particularly when we’re calling for partners-in-care and every resident to have a named visitor who can come and access and provide support, even if there is an outbreak,” Gear said. “We can’t have the supply of rapid antigen tests being the barrier to those sorts of programs which are also a boost to the workforce, because they will help take some of the pressure off of the workforce.” The aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, said the government had provided more than 6m tests to the aged care sector. It was prioritising test supply to outbreak sites, he said. But the ANMF says pleas for the defence force to be deployed as a surge workforce have so far been ignored. “The ANMF is engaging with the federal government and our industry stakeholders to address the various issues impacting health and aged care during the pandemic, but from what our members are telling us, it’s crucial that chronic understaffing, particularly in nursing homes, is resolved – before lives are lost unnecessarily,” Sharp said.",News/Australia news,"‘Pushed to the edge’: Australian aged care providers facing dire staff shortages, unions say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/28/pushed-to-the-edge-australian-aged-care-workers-under-incredible-stress-say-unions
1/28/2022,"Have you ever wanted to see a US soldier bricking himself because he thinks he’s heard a bear? Of course you have. We all have. Thankfully, some benevolent television executive clocked that and made Alone for us: 10 people are dumped in the wilderness, completely alone (geddit), competing to see who can survive the longest and win US$500,000. Here’s the kicker: none of the contestants know how well anyone else is doing, so they have to just keep going until everyone else drops out. “It’s the type of thing you see on the news, where a guy gets lost in the woods, and we’re purposefully doing it,” says one early contestant, sounding as if he’s just realised what those 400 waivers were for.  At first, Alone might sound like the worst kind of reality TV. We’ve seen thousands of shows about guys who want to drink their own wee and stomp around a forest; at this point, most of us would politely invite them to stay there. But in every season of Alone – without fail – the blowhards drop out quickly when things get too hard, or too wet, or too scary. Like Desmond, the aforementioned army man. Oh Desmond. In the first episode of season two, Desmond brags that he’ll “come back 20 pounds heavier, with a bear skin suit on. You know, from eating the motherfucker”; on his first day he thinks he hears a bear and immediately asks to be taken home. Alone does seem to trade in middle-aged men who married young and are now desperate for adventure; frankly, the producers could have made another series called Alone that follows the alarming number of pregnant wives and small children being left at home so dad could eat kelp and shout at cougars. But the show’s gender balance does improve with each season as it got more popular, and it becomes more interesting for it. During Covid, everyone has enjoyed nice shows like Bake Off or Frasier or The Office. But Alone is the nasty, compelling little masterpiece we should have been watching when we were considering using forest leaves for toilet paper and couldn’t hug our families. Because the thing that gets people on Alone is not the bears (or the mere concept of bears) or the starvation or the cold. It’s the solitude. The contestants don’t even get producers for company, as they’re all trained beforehand to film everything by themselves. They’re also completely separated, usually by distance, water or impassable mountains. (The first two seasons are filmed in northern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, while later seasons are in Patagonia, northern Mongolia and other parts of Canada.) Without the muscly morons or any producers, we’re left alone (geddit) to watch people who truly know how to survive in nature. This means you also learn a lot – how to make a fire, which plants are edible, how to catch fish with a discarded water bottle, even the nutritional value of a fingernail (two calories and one gram of protein, FYI). And as the contestants grow more skinny and vulnerable, Alone transforms too: the tone gentles into something wonderfully introspective, a meditation on modern life, on patience and gratitude, on our basic needs and wants. Some are broken by the experience (after a week, most people have some kind of a breakdown), while others revel in it (one winner spends his time carving wooden spoons and chopsticks for Christmas gifts when he goes home). “People are just amazing, we just don’t realise that,” says David, a ex-missionary who, at this point of season two, is six weeks in and so starved that even fishing hurts his body. “We’re social creatures, we’re not supposed to live alone ... I have no one else to talk to, or to depend on, or care for. I think that a signficant motivation in life, that keeps us moving, keeps us going, is to care for someone else.” Alone is less about the Desmonds, and more about the Davids of the world. And it makes for a very touching and compelling show. After 50-odd days, the first winner (I won’t spoil it) turns to the camera men as they walk towards him and says, disappointed, “This is it? So soon?” And reader, I almost believed him.

1/28/2022,"If, like me, you have a habit of buying clothes that don’t actually fit you but can’t resist trousers blessed with a wonderful pattern or a blazer with excellent buttons, you need a tailor. Or if, like me, you prefer to buy vintage or secondhand over modern fast fashion for environmental reasons, you need a tailor to make everyone else’s old clothes newly yours. While tailoring might seem like an extravagance, it is a small outlay when compared to the financial and environmental costs of buying new clothes every time something no longer fits.  As a small woman with a penchant for trousers that once belonged to old men, I often need waists and hems brought in and up on treasures I find in op-shops. A friend of mine now swears by getting her clothes taken out after having gained weight during lockdown. And tailoring doesn’t require a trip to Savile Row (unless you’re a particularly fancy Guardian reader; if so, I doff my top hat to you). Most alteration shops are accessibly priced, with most changes falling somewhere under $50. The most expensive alterations will involve specific fabrics, like silks, or dresses, particularly anything with a pleat. Your local shopping centres and suburbs will likely have a dry cleaner who will also offer an alteration service. Some big chains, like Uniqlo, offer an in-store alteration service if you go to their bigger shops. It might take some trial and error to find a regular tailor you trust, but generally anyone can get a new hem right, so it is a place to start. Just go in with a clear idea of the result you want – a cinched waist, more room in the shoulders, a tapered leg – and they’ll do the rest. The best tailor I have found so far was a lovely old Turkish man who ran a small dry cleaner in my previous suburb; no matter what I brought him, he would take it on and usually make even more ambitious suggestions for improvements to the fit, for which he’d never charge me more than $20. There are other cheap ways to freshen up clothes, some that you may be able to do yourself. One is swapping out buttons: I like to buy interesting ones from vintage shops and sew them on with a coloured thread – another small change that can make a big difference, and turn an ignorable coat into an enviable one. Tailoring has also made me fall in love with clothes again, which makes me wear those pieces more often and leaves me less inclined to buying others. And ladies? Tailors can even add pockets.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Easy wins: save cash, get clothes that fit and reduce waste by tailoring",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/28/easy-wins-save-cash-get-clothes-that-fit-and-reduce-waste-by-tailoring
1/28/2022,"Even during the summer holiday switch-off it was impossible to miss the takes about the Netflix satire Don’t Look Up. Climate scientists related to the helplessness and panic felt by the astronomers in the movie who discovered a “planet killing” comet about to hit Earth, only to have their warnings mocked and ignored.  Critics panned it. Too obvious and laboured, they said. Which indeed it might be. But a purely cinematic critique of a parable about missing the point of planetary destruction does kind of … miss the point. In the same lazy beach week that I watched Don’t Look Up, I also read the beautiful Bewilderment by Richard Power, with its wrenching depiction of a neurodivergent nine-year-old who simply cannot understand why adults are ignoring accelerating signs of environmental destruction. Both book and movie made me think about how we report the climate crisis. Even in the grip of a pandemic, it is the emergency of our times, and raising the alarm is an ongoing editorial priority for the Guardian, in Australia and globally. The undercurrent of that reporting, the bleak truth beneath every story, is the gap between what the science says to be true, and what we do about it. In Australian public policy that gap is a yawning chasm, a reality that has been drowned out, wilfully ignored and wickedly misrepresented during a decade of climate “wars”. The “wars”, of course, were never about who had the best plan to avoid unfolding environmental catastrophe, but rather which party or faction could most effectively turn not having any plan to their immediate political advantage, or which was best at misrepresenting and destroying a competitor’s workable ideas. Maybe that’s why it was so hard to laugh during Don’t Look Up when Meryl Streep, playing the US president who had just been told of impending global destruction, decided the best thing to do was to “sit tight and assess” until after the midterms. Anyone approaching the issue with basic scientific literacy sees the disconnect between science and politics. Most have coped by focusing on the practical, the possible, the incremental changes that inch things forward. Not allowing the idea of perfect climate policy to become the enemy of the good might have felt more consequential had more good policy been on offer. But through that lens, there was incremental progress towards the end of 2021. Both major parties committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, although as Guardian Australia’s environment editor, Adam Morton, pointed out, the Coalition’s commitment included no new policies, largely relied on unproven technology and did not actually get the country to net zero. Or, as our political editor, Katharine Murphy, put it, it was really just “the status quo with some new speculative graphs”. Then Labor announced a 2030 target of a 43% reduction in emissions, more ambitious than the Coalition’s 26-28%, but still carefully calibrated to try to withstand yet another scare campaign. Rather than dusting off their hyperbolic lines about the destruction of the economy, business and employer groups supported Labor’s policy, leading Morton to tentatively wonder whether the climate wars might be over. At the moment a political truce around inadequate policy seems like a best possible scenario. Maybe even followed by modest progress during the next term of parliament. But we are long past the time for incrementalism. With rapidly diminishing years left before the world runs out of time to decarbonise, this year’s election has to move beyond the tired analysis about how Australian parties may find some slick or sneaky climate message that satisfies voters in “coal seats” as well as those in the inner city, as if “coal” seats are somehow immune from the ecological and economic impacts of global heating. The questions demanded by that gap between science and political reality can no longer be trumped by backroom strategic games. Does Australia really want to play its part in limiting global warming to 1.5C? Do those vying for political office really understand the consequences of failing to meet that target? If they are committed to it, why is the government spending $600m on a new gas-fired power plant in New South Wales – to take just one of many examples of policy blatantly contradicting promises. Its own market operator says it’s not needed and the International Energy Agency said almost a year ago there could be no new investments in coal, oil or gas if the world was to have even a shot of meeting that goal. Perhaps the mobilising “Voices of” or teal independents will force these questions on to the agenda, or if not them, the moderate Liberals whose seats they threaten. Perhaps the possibility of a hung parliament and the need to deal with some of those independents will steer the debate back towards something resembling sane. Perhaps the overwhelming concern of voters will finally hold sway. Guardian Australia has worked to elevate the climate debate since its establishment in 2013, with news, analysis, video series and podcasts. We’ll be intensifying our efforts this election year, through news and analysis from Murphy and Morton and environment reporters Lisa Cox and Graham Readfearn, through Readfearn’s factchecking column Temperature Check and Peter Hannam’s reporting on the green economy. However the politics plays, we’ll stick with the task of asking the questions demanded by the science.",News/Environment,The gap between Australian climate policy and the science is closing far too slowly – we have to keep up the pressure,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/28/the-gap-between-australian-climate-policy-and-the-science-is-closing-far-too-slowly-we-have-to-keep-up-the-pressure
1/28/2022,"Pharmacies in some areas of Sydney with the highest rates of Omicron infections are struggling to provide rapid antigen tests to concession card holders despite participating in the federal government scheme. Only three of 15 participating pharmacies from the South Western Sydney local health district had any RATs available to concession card holders when contacted by the Guardian this week, with the exact same number replicated in the Western Sydney local health district.  Both those health districts have some of the highest rates of infection in New South Wales with both districts accounting for a third of cases since the beginning of December. On Thursday alone the districts accounted for over 25% of total cases in NSW, with over 30% of PCR tests coming from South Western and Western Sydney. But there is an ongoing discrepancy between PCR and RATs being registered from the region with both health districts lagging behind other regions in NSW when it comes to reporting positive RATs while simultaneously recording the most positive PCR tests in the state. The discrepancy could be linked to the lack of RATs available to concession card holders across the region. It comes as the president of Professional Pharmacists Australia, Dr Geoff March, called the concession card scheme rollout “reckless and negligent”. “The federal government’s announcement relied on pharmacies sourcing the RAT tests themselves, but a recent survey found that over 93% of pharmacists have reported major difficulties accessing any supplies at all,” he said. In a statement, the PPA outlined how the shortages had left pharmacists reeling, saying many were at “breaking point”. “The shortages are taking a major toll on pharmacists themselves, with over 75% of pharmacists also reporting that the shortage of RAT tests had a ‘significant’ or ‘extreme’ impact on their ability to do their work,” March said. The PPA also called for the government to provide pharmacists with PPE supplies such as N95 masks, saying the shortage of supplies was “undermining” the health of chemists. Across the Western Sydney Local Health District, which includes Blacktown, Parramatta, Auburn and Castle Hill, pharmacies told the Guardian they do not expect stock to return until mid-February. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Some said they sell out of stock extremely quickly, and – with shortages affecting wholesalers as well – have struggled to meet demand. A pharmacist from North Rocks who asked to remain anonymous said most of their lack of stock was linked to wholesalers, who were restricted in what they could offer. “[The wholesalers] could only offer us single packs, they have themselves struggled to get the packs to us,” they said. “We actually haven’t been able to sell any of the concession card tests, we are a small pharmacy and they usually sell out on the same day they arrive.” In the South Western Sydney Local Health District, which covers areas hit hard by the Delta outbreak last year including Bankstown, Liverpool and Fairfield, pharmacies have similarly struggled. The three pharmacists that did have stock told the Guardian they had placed restrictions on purchases to limit people hoarding the tests, with all three saying they could only offer two at a time. The scheme, introduced by the federal government earlier this week, allows the 6.6m concession card holders in Australia to access up to 10 free RATs over a three month period. Guardian Australia reported on Thursday pharmacies are losing up to $7.50 on each rapid antigen test under the scheme. The tests currently cost the pharmacies up to $17.50 each but the government is providing only a $10 reimbursement, according to the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. The guild has established a rapid antigen test finder for concession card holders, but a pharmacist in Bankstown who also asked to be anonymous explained it only shows participating chemists. “It doesn’t actually reflect stock levels, just shows participating pharmacists,” they said. “At this point, we don’t know when stock will return, the demand has been that high.” Smaller pharmacies have also been competing with larger pharmacy chains such as Chemist Warehouse for supplies, further squeezing the market. The federal government has previously indicated that testing supplies will improve in the coming weeks, with 16m tests expected to arrive at pharmacies before the end of January. It comes as NSW recorded 17,316 new infections on Thursday, a slight drop on the previous day’s figures, with 7,382 of those cases from RATs and 9,934 from PCR tests.",News/World news,Sydney pharmacies in areas hit by Omicron struggle to provide concessional rapid tests,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/sydney-pharmacies-in-areas-hit-by-omicron-struggle-to-provide-concessional-rapid-tests
