4/9/2022,"“There’s no art to find the mind’s construction in the face,” says Duncan, about the duplicity of the first Thane of Cawdor, in Macbeth. Which on first glance has the authority of evidence – the king did not see the betrayal coming – but on further examination is patently untrue. Reading each other is one of the most complex and widespread of human achievements, even if our efforts don’t always succeed. In fact, the way in which we perceive and respond to others very much shapes who we are. There is neuroscientific evidence that the earliest brain development occurs through the relationships a baby has with the people around it; the minute by minute testing of whether an adult will come when called, and whether or not their faces and actions tell the baby they are kind when they come, being laid down in the structure of the growing brain, and forming the basis of instincts that influence our interactions with others throughout our lives. This applies most intensely to primary carers, but also to peers and society – one of many reasons why it is so concerning to read reports that some children, accustomed to a combination of reduced social contact and masks, are arriving in early years settings having difficulty reading faces. Listening and responding to others is how we learn to speak. Again, this is at first unconscious, and is always highly determined by who – or what – we are responding to (the pandemic, again, has provided incidental laboratory conditions: there are reports of children speaking in the accents of their favourite cartoons). External language, and tone, of course becomes internal language too: the medium through which we articulate our thoughts and feelings. Language is not just for humans. Whales, apes and parrots all can communicate. This week it was suggested that even mushrooms might be talking to each other via electrical signals. What could they potentially tell humans about the state of our ecosystem? Nothing good, one imagines. “So long, and thanks for all the fish” was the message left by dolphins when they departed the soon-to-be demolished Earth in Douglas Adams’ Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. But to be human is to imagine, and to appreciate others’ imaginations. In 2013, an influential study found that reading literary fiction improved participants’ empathy. The ability to guess with accuracy what another may be thinking or feeling is a skill that develops before most children go to school. Empathy provides a foundation for moral and emotional intelligence; skimping on these foundations risks narrowing a person’s cognitive range. While there is a serious argument that empathy, as a basis for moral action in the world, has its limits, no one would argue against its usefulness. Too much time on one’s own has social costs, as lockdowns have shown. A lack of interaction damages mental health. Science has found that neurons in the brain are fired both when we perform an action and when we see an action performed by others. Varied and open socialisation, at all stages of life but especially for the very young, is not an optional extra but a fundamental necessity – both for individuals and for the society of which they are a part.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on learning to socialise: getting to know you | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/08/the-guardian-view-on-learning-to-socialise-getting-to-know-you
4/9/2022,"Here is a celebration of Wales in all its glory. With a gust of wind, Seiriol Davies’ musical welcomes us to Milky Peaks, a pebble-dashed market town in the heart of Snowdonia. Inhabited by an array of lovable eccentrics, it receives a nomination for best British town – a ploy of a competition designed by a rightwing party looking to find a new political home. There are flickers of genius in Davies’ writing. Complete with a robotic chanting chorus that steer the drama – “we begin at the starting point,” they inform us – and an on-stage accompanist (Dylan Townley) who explodes from the sidelines into chuckle-worthy supporting roles, it is masterfully inventive. But, with a cast of so many characters, the script meanders between loosely connected stories and we never find the drama’s core. Which isn’t to say it’s not funny. Matthew Blake as Ms Pariah Carey is a dazzling presence and high-kicks with astonishing vigour in a Madonna-like costume. The deadpan straight white man, Alun John (Tanya Bridgeman), has a delightful song about the hardships of his gender. “You’re being insensitive to my little needs,” she tunes while marching blokeishly across the stage. It is when we get to more sentimental territory that momentum starts to dip. Lisa Jên Brown’s Mother is warm and wondrously Welsh but her solos drag and prolong a piece that could already use a trim. A subplot about the local artistic director (Sophie Winter) hiring, firing, then rehiring Ms Pariah Carey as the lead inMy Fair Lady also quickly tires. The slate-towered set, designed by Janet Bird, comes spectacularly alive when a gay club opens, and the twirling disco lights and rainbow-tiled dancefloor deliver a joy-filled moment. It’s worth the trip if just to see this glittering delight.

4/9/2022,"The shirtmaker TM Lewin could return to the high street after being rescued from administration by its main lender, understood to be Petra Group. It is not clear if the group’s 50 staff will be kept on under the rescue deal for TM Lewin, which called in administrators last month for the second time in less than two years. The business, which operated 150 shops before the pandemic, hasbeen a solely online business since first going into administration in June 2020. The group, which is best known for its shirts but also sells suits, knitwear, coats and accessories such as ties, became a victim of a shift towards more casual dressing as working from home increased during Covid. Founded by Thomas Mayes Lewin and Geoffrey James Lewin on Panton Street, London, in 1898, the partners established themselves on nearby Jermyn Street, the home of English shirtmaking, in 1903. The firm supplied the RAF and British army with uniforms during the first world war and made its shirts in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, until the late 1980s when it moved production overseas. Will Wright, the head of restructuring at Interpath Advisory and joint administrator to TM Lewin, said: “Following a great deal of interest, we’re pleased to have achieved this sale which secures the future of this famous British retail brand. “We understand the new owners will be relaunching the online trading platform over the coming weeks and, in the longer term, are considering the possibility of opening new high street stores.” Formal clothing retailers have struggled during the pandemic but there are signs of rejuvenation.

4/9/2022,"That picture of Vladimir Putin, alone at the end of a long Kremlin table, may prove one of the enduring images of this war – but it is deceiving. Because although every day brings fresh confirmation that the Russian dictator is drenched in blood, with the rocket attack on Kramatorsk only the latest evidence, he is not friendless. Naturally, he has allies among his fellow brutal world leaders, whether in Minsk, Damascus or Beijing, but he has chums in less expected places too. In a conflict cast by both sides as Putin v the west, the Russian leader has powerful friends behind enemy lines – and, even if his western admirers have had to engage in some deft footwork since the invasion of Ukraine, they are gaining ground. The most flagrant example is Viktor Orbán, apostle of what he calls “illiberal democracy”, who last weekend secured a fourth term as ruler of Hungary. It would be wrong to say he was “re-elected”, because that might imply a genuine election, which this wasn’t: Orbán controls the Hungarian media and the entire apparatus of the state. To be sure, he had to tone down the pro-Putinism during the campaign; he admitted Ukrainian refugees and went along with EU sanctions on Moscow. But now he can revert to type. He has become the EU’s longest-serving leader, armed with an absolute majority in Budapest and a seat on the European Council in Brussels. As one seasoned Europe-watcher puts it, when it comes to doing Putin a favour and sabotaging future action by the EU, “Orbán can deliver”. Given that the key to the western response to the Russian invasion has been unity, and that the EU and Nato work by consensus, one spoiler can thwart everyone else. Still, this weekend Putin will be eyeing an even bigger prize. Sunday sees the first round of voting in the French presidential election, and polls show a surge in support for the perennial candidate of the far right, Marine Le Pen. In a head-to-head contest against Emmanuel Macron, the likely second round in a fortnight, the gap between the two is tiny, well within the margin of error. After 2016, the year of Brexit and Donald Trump, no one should be reckless enough to rule out a shock in France. Le Pen’s links to Putin are more blatant than most. In October 2014, her party borrowed €9m (£7.5m) from a Russian bank to fund its campaign for local elections. Her promo material for this current contest, admittedly printed before the invasion, features a smiling picture of her with the butcher of Moscow. Like Orbán, she was quick to put some distance between herself and Putin. She condemned the invasion, while a key party ally took a bus to pick up Ukrainian refugees. She’s been lucky too, blessed by the presence in the race of Éric Zemmour, standard-bearer of the even further right whose adulation of Putin and initial hostility to Ukrainian refugees has allowed Le Pen to look moderate by comparison. That has enabled her to focus on the cost of living crisis and to exploit Macron’s near-toxic unpopularity with the many millions of French voters who see the incumbent president as arrogant, elitist and contemptuously out of touch. Yet there can be little doubt what a Le Pen victory would mean. Until the recent volte-face, her party’s MEPs stood in the way of almost every EU measure that might discomfort Putin. And even though Frexit is no longer a declared Le Pen dream, her programme of treaty revision would, in effect, dismantle French membership of the EU, weakening the body, perhaps fatally – which is exactly what Putin wants. As for Macron’s other rival, the leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon, put it this way: over the years, he was far more rhetorically exercised against Nato and the US than he was about Putin and Russia. Of course, Orbán and Le Pen catch the eye because they are either in high office or terrifyingly close to it. But Putin’s western friends on both the right and left can be found closer to home too. The British circle of devotees is not confined to the likes of Nigel Farage, who once named Putin as the world leader he most admired, or George Galloway, whose Twitter profile featured until this week not one but two broadcasting gigs with the Putin-controlled media outlet RT, details hastily deleted after Twitter identified Galloway’s account as “Russia state-affiliated media”. No, the more troubling ties are nearer the top. Plenty of European observers have noted the Conservative party’s fondness for oligarch cash, as well as its recent slowness in tackling dirty money, suspecting the latter is, as one puts it, “a return on the investment Moscow made in British politics”. True, Britain has not hesitated to arm Ukraine, but to some sceptical European eyes, that looks a bit like the Orbán or Le Pen manoeuvres: hasty efforts at belated detoxification. All of which is perhaps small beer compared with the big one, the most powerful western friend Vladimir Putin ever had: Donald Trump. He’s no longer in the White House, though he could well be back in 2024, while the legacy of his admiration for Putin – who he praised as a “genius” – lives on in his party. A January poll found that Republicans had a more favourable opinion of Putin than they did of Joe Biden or Kamala Harris. Fox News’s top-rated anchor, Tucker Carlson, has been airing Kremlin talking points on his show, including the false claim that the US is funding biological weapons labs in Ukraine, and he’s fond of suggesting that he has less beef with Putin than he does with US liberals. After all, asks Carlson: “Has Putin ever called me a racist?” This gets close to the heart of the matter. For a certain stripe of rightist, Putin has long embodied an alternative to western cultural decline at the hands of the liberals: a nationalist, conservative, white, Christian ideal uncorrupted by feminism or gay rights. That picture has become confused since the 24 February invasion, now that it is Putin who is slaughtering white Christian Europeans. But plenty cling to it all the same. For now, that is a minority position. But the success of Orbán and Le Pen shows Putinism has put down strong roots in the west, ones that might survive the current storm. Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, worries about what happens six months from now, when westerners become desensitised to images of violence in Ukraine and when the cost of living is through the roof. “Eventually the political space will open up for someone to say, ‘This conflict is too expensive – and maybe Putin’s not that bad anyway’.” It means the struggle against Putinism will not be fought with sanctions and arms alone. Nor will it be conducted solely in Russia or Ukraine. The threat is not so far away. The call is coming from inside the house. Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist.

4/9/2022,"Ukraine says dozens of people have died in a rocket strike at a railway station packed with civilians fleeing the threat of a major Russian offensive in the country’s east. Russia’s military is regrouping after withdrawing eastwards from areas around Kyiv, where a forensics team on Friday began exhuming a mass grave in the town of Bucha. The mayor of Kramatorsk in the eastern region of Donetsk estimated about 4,000 people were gathered at the train station at the time of the strike, which Russia denies conducting. The White House decried the “horrific and devastating images” that have emerged in its aftermath. Since Russian troops pulled back from Bucha, Ukrainian officials say hundreds of dead civilians have been found there. Visiting the town on Friday, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said it had witnessed the “unthinkable”. In the past few days drone footage has been released showing the northern town of Borodianka in ruins, days after it was retaken from Russian forces by Ukraine’s army: Footage filmed on Wednesday also shows destruction in Bucha, Gostomel and Irpin, all to the west of Kyiv. Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
4/9/2022,"The family of two young siblings killed in a motorway crash caused by a drink-driver who had been sipping red wine at the wheel and had cocaine in his system have said they are devastated and angry after he was jailed for just nine years. Judge Williams acknowledged many people would feel the term he passed on Martin Newman was inadequate, but said sentencing laws set by parliament meant he could not jail him for longer. Newman, 41, admitted causing the death by dangerous driving of Jayden-Lee Lucas, three, and his sister, Gracie-Ann, four. He also pleaded guilty to seriously injuring their mother, Rhiannon Lucas. The court was told the painter-decorator was twice over the drink-driving limit and had traces of cocaine in his system after partying the night before with colleagues in the east Midlands. Newman, himself a father of two, had been travelling from Leicester to his home in the village of Croeserw, in Neath Port Talbot, on the M4 in his white Ford Transit van when he veered on to the hard shoulder at about 1.45pm on Saturday 5 February and hit the family’s stationary red Ford Fiesta. They had pulled over to allow Gracie-Ann to go to the toilet after she had complained of a bad stomach. Newman crashed into the rear of the car, where the children were, at 57mph, causing them “catastrophic brain injuries”. He had been seen driving erratically before the collision, talking on his phone and sipping red wine while driving, telling police it was for his “dry throat”. He had drunk double vodkas, 10 cans of cider and taken cocaine until 5am on the day of the crash. The judge told Newman he was guilty of the “most serious level of dangerous driving” but said: “Parliament set the maximum sentence at 14 years’ imprisonment. Many will think such a maximum sentence inadequate to reflect what you’ve done. Many might call for the maximum sentence to be re-examined. That’s not a matter for the court, but for parliament.” The judge said he was bound by the law to reduce Newman’s sentence by a third because he had entered a guilty plea at the first available opportunity. Newman was sentenced to nine years and four months in prison. He will be expected to serve only half the term in custody. He was also banned from driving for 14 years and eight months. Lucas’s uncle, Darren Lucas, said: “We’re just absolutely devastated. He should have got a lot longer than that. The sentence wasn’t harsh enough for taking the lives of two children while drunk and on drugs and everything else. The law needs to change. The family will be appealing to get a heavier sentence. We’re going to start campaigning to get the law changed and do the best by the memory of these children so that something like this doesn’t happen again.” A statement from the family, who are from Tredegar, Blaenau Gwent, read: “Our family home now feels like an empty shell without them and the love and happiness they brought us can not ever be replaced.

4/9/2022,"For more than six centuries, the austere interior of the chapel of Sant Cristòfol has greeted weary hikers as they make their way through the mountains near Spain’s Costa Blanca. That was, at least, until “intense” inspiration struck Jesús Cees, who decided to transform the white walls of the remote chapel with a riot of vivid murals that the artist describes as some of his best work. Not everyone has been as impressed: regional officials are weighing up whether to fine him for painting over a protected heritage site without permission, while Spanish media swiftly likened the chapel’s makeover to the botched “Monkey Christ” restoration. Cees had long toyed with the idea of splashing colour across the site. Four years ago, he broached the idea with officials in Alcoy, the city responsible for overseeing the chapel, as it is no longer used for religious purposes. “They told me not to touch it; they forbade me,” said Cees. The 53-year-old attempted to set the idea aside, but the chapel’s stark white walls haunted him. “The inspiration was intense … I decided to do it and ask for forgiveness later.” It was a strategy that had worked before. Eight years earlier, Cees had painted a colourful, yellow-eyed take on the chapel’s namesake saint – “I did it in my style, you know,” he said – in order to cover up a patch of graffiti scrawled in the entryway. His latest revamp got under way in the summer of 2020. On a near-daily basis he rose at the crack of dawn, spending hours hiking to and from the chapel in the Sierra de Mariola mountains. His unauthorised overhaul was made public earlier this month, after the city asked Valencia’s regional government to look into the matter, potentially paving the way for fines or a repainting of the chapel. The municipality of Alcoy confirmed it had rebuffed an earlier proposal from Cees to paint the chapel, describing the artist’s plans as “discordant” with its gothic style and its status as a protected building. “Without disparaging the [artist’s] work, it is anachronistic and could affect the original pigments,” it said in a statement. Cees said he was surprised at the city’s reaction to his efforts. “What’s better? The way it is now or when the walls were blank?” Cees asked. “It didn’t cost them a penny. What more do they want?” He rejected any association between his work and that of the devout parishioner who sought to restore the flaking Ecce Homo painting in a north-eastern Spanish church in 2012. “You can’t compare them. I took on a blank space, she restored a small fresco,” he said. He was forced to halt his project four months in after he fell from a ladder while trying to paint the ceiling. Cees hit the chapel’s stone floor, breaking both of his wrists. Once he fully recovered, he was determined to return to the site. “My plan is to finish painting the entire chapel, hopefully this summer,” he said. “Because what I start, I finish.”",News/World news,‘Ask for forgiveness later’: Artist controversially paints Spanish chapel,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/spanish-chapel-artist-murals-jesus-cees-sant-cristofol
4/9/2022,"The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his far-right challenger Marine Le Pen attacked each other in media interviews and walkabouts as final polls showed the gap between them narrowing on the last day of campaigning before Sunday’s first-round vote. Macron said Le Pen was “lying” to voters about her “racist” manifesto programme, which includes banning the Muslim headscarf, and accused her of “complacency” in her ties with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. He said in an interview with Le Parisien that Le Pen’s social policies were aimed at “splitting society in the most brutal way”; she would create mass unemployment and scare off foreign investors; and that her policies on the cost-of-living were “funded with mock currency”. On Putin, he said: “I’ve never been complacent. Which was not always the case for Marine Le Pen who is financially dependent on Vladimir Putin and his regime and who has always been complacent with him.” The war in Ukraine remains the second most important topic for French voters after fears over making ends meet amid the cost-of-living crisis. Le Pen, whose far-right party took out a €9m loan from a Russian bank in 2014 for a local election campaign, said the “violence” of Macron’s comments showed he was panicking. She said she had condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and that Macron had been “very aggressive” in the campaign, which betrayed his own “nervousness”. Le Pen told a jubilant final rally in her party’s southern stronghold of Perpignan that she had never been so close to power. She compared Macron to a “stunned boxer”. Final polls show the two candidates most likely to reach a second-round runoff on 24 April are Macron and Le Pen, but that the hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon is also gaining support. The latest OpinionWay-Kea Partners poll showed Macron on 26% in the first round and Le Pen edging up to 22%. Mélenchon had steadily risen to 17%. An Ifop poll showed similar trends: Macron had slipped back from his peak of more than 30% in March and was sitting at 26.5% with Le Pen having risen to 24%. Mélenchon was in third position, but gaining. Le Pen’s continual rise over the past week is significant. This is her third presidential bid and in previous elections she had lost ground in the polls in the final week. The last Elabe poll for BFMTV, released on Friday, showed that if Macron faced Le Pen in a second-round final on 24 April he would win with 51% compared with Le Pen’s 49% – her highest ever polling position. This lead is so small it is in the margin of error and pollsters have said there is now a mathematical possibility Le Pen could win the presidential election. All will depend on Sunday’s first-round result and turnout, and whether supporters of other parties go on to vote tactically to stop the far right, as they have done in the past. In 2017 Macron beat Le Pen with 66% after voters from the left and mainstream right moved to stop the National Rally politician. Le Pen has risen to become France’s second favourite political personality this month, behind the former prime minister Édouard Philippe. Her decade-long public relations campaign to detoxify her party’s jackbooted image has in recent weeks paid off as she focused on the cost of living crisis. The presence on the campaign trail of a new rival, the far-right TV pundit Éric Zemmour, has worked in Le Pen’s favour as his inflammatory comments and convictions for incitement to racial hatred have allowed Le Pen to style herself as more moderate, even if her radical, anti-immigration manifesto remains the same and would prioritise French people over non-French people for housing, jobs and benefits. Macron, asked by RTL radio if he feared losing, said: “Nothing is taken for granted ... [but] I have a spirit of conquest more than a spirit of defeat.” Sunday’s vote is expected to mark another step in the transformation of national politics in France. The two parties who had alternated power from the post-war period until five years ago – the Socialists and Nicolas Sarkozy’s Républicains on the Gaullist right– are currently totalling only about 10%. The Socialist party’s candidate, Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, was forecast to take 2%, confirming the decline of her party on the national stage. Les Républicains could implode if their candidate, Valérie Pécresse, the head of the Île-de-France region that includes Paris, sinks to 8% as predicted by the Elabe poll. Zemmour is running level with Pécresse, jostling for position to take part in a rebuilding of the French right by forming a far-right grouping of what he calls the “patriotic bourgeoisie” and working-class voters. The Green party’s Yannick Jadot is on 4%.",News/World news,France elections: Macron’s lead over Le Pen narrowing as vote nears,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/france-elections-macron-lead-over-le-pen-narrowing-vote-nears
