3/13/2022,"Idon’t know about you, but spring really couldn’t come early enough for me this year. So I am watching the first signs of blooming bulbs and blossom with an enormous sense of excitement and anticipation. While, for some reason, it always seems to be flowering cherries that get all the attention, for me it’s magnolias that always steal the show, both in spring and beyond. So here are some of the very best places around the country to see these amazing trees in all their glory, as the weather finally starts to warm. I think I’ll have to start with Kew Gardens, mainly as it’s my local haunt, which I am most familiar with. There’s a hidden spot in the arboretum, off the main trails between the glasshouses, which just erupts into pastel pink shades each spring – like a scene from a manga film. With most of these mature trees being the wild species forms instead of modern hybrids bred to fit our increasingly small gardens, there is something just jaw dropping about not just the concentration of trees, but their soaring height. Incredible. To many people, the finest collection in the country is at Caerhays Castle in Cornwall, which has some of the oldest specimens of many of the wild species outside their original east Asian habitat. With candyfloss clouds floating around faux-turrets of a manor house from the 1900s, it really feels as if you have fallen into a fairytale. Just down the road from the Eden Project and the Lost Gardens of Heligan, it is a must-see destination on any spring jaunt down to Cornwall. It is one of four gardens around the country to share the national collection of magnolias, along with Bodnant in north Wales, Wentworth Castle in Yorkshire and Windsor Great Park in Berkshire, so you don’t have to be a south-westerner to admire the spectacle. One garden I haven’t yet managed to get to, but am constantly told by my colleagues is an absolute must-see, is Rowallane in County Down, Northern Ireland. Famous for its collection of magnolias under-planted with azaleas and daphnes, it creates a spring triple-whammy in an old walled garden. But perhaps what I love about magnolias is the fact that their charm lasts far beyond a few weeks of spring. Many species tend to create beautifully slated, character-filled specimens, whose bonsai-like architecture is stunning even as leafless specimens in the dead of winter. With fresh, apple-green leaves and often a secondary sprinkling of flowers in late summer, they beat flowering cherries hands down. And if you fancy checking out your favourite form for a new addition for your garden, all these famous gardens make amazing places to windowshop.

3/13/2022,"Trustees of the pension fund for members of parliament have agreed to sell all investments linked to Russia after a cross-party group of more than 60 MPs raised concerns about connections to Russian oil and gas companies. The trustees met last Thursday, having received the MPs’ letter, and agreed to act immediately to ensure the fund was cleansed of both direct and indirect Russian interests. The Labour MP Clive Betts, a member of the board of trustees, said: “Should we be disinvesting from Russian interests? Yes, as quickly and as far as possible, though we have to do this through our fund managers.” A host of international companies have ceased or paused business with Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. Last week McDonald’s, Starbucks, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo bowed to public pressure and suspended operations in Russia. Big public and private pension funds are now under pressure to clean up their portfolios and investigate how funds they have invested in are linked to Russia. In their letter to the trustees, co-ordinated by the Green party’s Caroline Lucas, the MPs noted that in the 2020 annual review of the fund, HSBC was listed as one of the scheme’s top 20 holdings. “According to Bloomberg data, HSBC, through its asset management arm, owns equity stakes in five of the biggest Russian oil and gas companies – Gazprom, Rosneft, Tatneft, Lukoil and Novatek,” the MPs wrote. “HSBC doesn’t just do business with Russian oil and gas companies – it owns them. We therefore call for the immediate withdrawal of the fund’s investments from HSBC and from any other companies that are implicated in Russia in similar ways.” Documents about the fund show that about 49% is invested in global equities, and 8% in European loans. Lucas welcomed the trustees’ commitment and called for a “root and branch investigation so we can be confident that not one penny of our pension funds are directly or indirectly linked with Putin’s murderous regime”. Last week, the Church of England announced it had sold all £20m of investments in Russian companies in response to what the archbishops of Canterbury and York described as Vladimir Putin’s “act of evil” in Ukraine. The Local Government Pension Scheme advisory board has also told its members running schemes for councils around Britain to examine their portfolios for links to Russia. An HSBC spokesperson said: “In recent days, we have suspended our Russia-only funds and further reduced other funds’ exposure where this has been possible. As you would expect, HSBC is complying with all international sanctions.”",News/Business,MPs’ pension fund drops Russian-linked investments in protest,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/13/mps-pension-fund-drops-russian-linked-investments-in-protest
3/13/2022,"There is a dresser or display cabinet in almost every room in artist Mark Hearld’s house. In the front room, for example, he commissioned a local furniture maker to build an enormous, architectural “cabinet of curiosities”. Placed on the shelves or tucked under the arches are objects and ephemera gathered over a lifetime of making, finding, swapping and collecting. “The Laurence Sterne bust on the top shelf is based on the one in Shandy Hall by Joseph Nollekens,” explains Hearld. “The crepe paper party hat he’s wearing is from the Porte de Vanves flea market in Paris. I’ve brought the two together in an irreverent pairing, because I felt that the bust was a little too serious for my house. The party hat brings him to life in a sort of fusion of high literary culture and 1930s party culture – a bohemian mashup, if you like.” For Hearld – whose work encompasses collage, textile and wallpaper design, linocut printing and sculpture – the art of bargain hunting is akin to an act of creativity. “I find buying or finding an object is quite similar to actually creating one yourself,” he has previously explained. “They both satisfy a similar aesthetic impulse. Obviously if you make it, it’s a bit more virtuous, but if you find something cheap and you bring it home, that does feel almost like an act of creativity. And then, placing it next to other things is like making a 3D collage.” Hearld lives in the centre of York, in a late-Georgian, four-storey house. Over the years, a Victorian extension has been added and a 70s infill extension has been given a glass roof, making it “good for exhibitions’’. From the street, passersby will notice an illuminated, super-sized robin looking out of the central bay window – a salvaged 1960s Christmas decoration that once perched above a shop awning. “I like things that are decorative or theatrical,” says Hearld. “And objects that feel slightly improbable in an interior. Even if I wanted to be tasteful, I would probably end up being a little bit raucous by mistake.” Raucous is an apt description. Hearld’s latest exhibition and forthcoming book are both titled Raucous Invention – The Joy of Making. Together, they celebrate the vitality and imperfection of Hearld’s work. The book in particular explores how the exuberance of his work flows into and throughout his home. “I definitely have the sense of art and life being one and the same,” Hearld explains. Hearld’s work is endlessly inspired by nature. He studied illustration in Glasgow, followed by natural history illustration at the Royal College of Art. It follows that creatures of all shapes and sizes appear throughout his home – a lifesize terracotta goose on a dresser, decoy ducks, a pied hare frozen behind a glass display case and a glorious tiled mural in the kitchen depicting a free-ranging flock of peacocks. But birds and animals are just one area of interest for this semi-obsessive collector – Staffordshire pottery, children’s toys and mochaware also abound. Hearld is similarly drawn to workaday, artist-designed objects, such as his 1930s coffee set designed by the English artist Graham Sutherland. On another overladen dresser in the “stone room” (the original Georgian kitchen – hence the flagstone floor) is a display of pieces by contemporary slipware potters, such as Dylan Bowen, Geoffrey Fuller and Paul Young. “I’m very interested in living artists’ work and I love the idea of not just being a fine artist,” he explains. “I love the idea of designing things that people use, or rather ephemeral objects that just delight and enrich.” I ask Hearld to explain in what way the making of his home – which he describes as “just the right side of bohemian chaos” – is comparable to the process of creating a collage. We study the yellow mantelpiece in his front room and he describes how there is a formality to the placement of the two corn dollies, which have been formed into the shape of Devonshire crosses. His EQ Nicholson collage is positioned just so, as are the candlesticks and the pack of wooden hounds that run along the picture rail above. But, rather than leave it at that, the scene is layered with letters, cards and found objects – “the detritus and the ephemera that life throws at the interior finds its place,” says Hearld. At home, as in his art, it’s about finding the worth in discarded bits of paper. “Placing objects in a room is the same as pasting bits of paper,” Hearld explains. “With collage, certain artefacts or pieces of paper are placed thoughtfully and schematically to provide structure. And then other aspects – maybe surprising or discordant – find their way alongside those thought-out elements. It’s being open enough to find that discarded bit of paper, really only to represent itself, but in being there, adds exponentially to the dynamic of the picture. It’s the tension between those two things that creates energy and vivacity. For me, that’s why so many interior designed rooms fall short – they feel too rehearsed. It’s a life lived in a room that makes it exciting, I think.” Raucous Invention: The Joy of Making by Mark Hearld is published by St Jude’s Prints, £35 (stjudesprints.co.uk)",Lifestyle/Life and style,The bohemian mashup home showcasing a lifetime’s art,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/13/the-bohemian-mash-up-home-artist-mark-hearld-york
3/13/2022,"As the final whistle blew on a bruising and barnstorming and brilliant evening’s entertainment, Ireland’s players wreathed each other in hugs: their ordeal finally at an end, their conquest complete. Johnny Sexton, their captain and talisman, was not among them. He had been withdrawn with a few seconds left on the clock, presumably to grant him one last valedictory ovation from a Twickenham crowd that may never see him in action again. This is the sort of treatment Sexton should probably start getting used to over the coming months. Earlier in the week he finally ended months of speculation by revealing that his latest contract would be his last: a retirement announced 18 months in advance, taking him as far as the next World Cup in France. If the announcement itself was little surprise given that Sexton will be 38 by then and has already been fending off questions about his departure for half a decade, then there was also a certain curiosity to its timing. Nobody does the long farewell quite like the Irish: the moving montages, the floral bouquets, the touching tributes. The former winger Shane Horgan jokes that during Rory Best’s extended retirement tour of 2019, Best’s son Ben ended up spending more time on the Aviva pitch than he ever did. Brian O’Driscoll also announced his retirement almost a year in advance and in a recent Off The Ball podcast identified another possible pitfall of the drawn-out retirement: the procession of “last evers”. Every game becomes your last at a certain venue, your last against a certain opponent, your last in a certain competition. The epilogue of your career unfolds against a background music of finality, loss and premature memorialisation. Of course, you have to assume Sexton is too much of a professional to be affected by any of this. But perhaps it has an effect on how the rest of us see and talk about him. For Andy Farrell and the strategists of Irish rugby, there are plans to be tweaked, successors to be auditioned. Sexton may have declared his intention to “attack” the final part of his career. But somehow once you start the clock ticking, it becomes impossible not to start imagining the bomb. There were times when you could almost sense Ireland beginning to process these questions in real time. Sexton didn’t have a bad game, as such. He had a relatively quiet game, which in many ways was hardly his fault. Even so he kicked his points, kept things ticking over, exerted an austere calming influence on the decisive final stretch during which Ireland finally picked England off. But there was also a distinct absence of high notes, long periods spent on the margins watching the game explode around him, the maestro conducting an orchestra that nobody could hear. Afterwards Sexton talked about how Ireland’s famous cohesion was a product of their immaculate preparation, the exhaustive drilling of players already familiar with each other from the club game. Perhaps by contrast, Ireland’s struggles here sprang from a scenario they could scarcely have predicted, a game that unfolded in dazzlingly unfamiliar patterns. The early red card for Charlie Ewels added a note of chaos to a game already at high pitch, and as against 13-man Italy, here Ireland looked curiously scruffy and unsettled, seemingly in a rush to do everything at once. There were handling errors, dropped passes, passes to nobody. The Irish pack lost its grip on the scrum early on and never really regained it. The absence of Andrew Porter and Rónan Kelleher was keenly felt. Sexton himself gave away a sloppy offside penalty by standing in front of the kicker. Ireland went into the half-time break 15-9 up, but still it felt like a battering, a retreat, a job made far harder than it needed to be. Sexton did grow into the game a little as it went on. There was one artful little kick over the top for Andrew Conway to chase, some sharp passes to set up Ireland’s trademark round-the-corner attacks. Then of course, there’s the stuff few of us see: the little directions and asides, the words of encouragement, the messages and maxims that will have been hammered home in a thousand team meetings. Sexton is on that rarefied plane of athlete where even his mere presence can feel quietly decisive. Certainly Ireland fans are entitled to wonder how differently this championship might have gone had he been fit in Paris. Even his late withdrawal, it turned out, had tactical rather than nostalgic motives. Afterwards Sexton explained that his 80th-minute curtain call was not some mawkish milking of applause, but a sly slice of gamesmanship. “I was walking off to try and drag some time out at the end of the game,” he said. “It [being my final game at Twickenham] wasn’t something that crossed my mind.” And of course, any win at Twickenham is worth celebrating in its own right. Perhaps the fact that Ireland were able to win with their captain such a peripheral figure can be a source of encouragement. Perhaps, by contrast, it was a foretaste of a colder future. What happens when your big-game player fails to have a big game? What happens when a team is cast so thoroughly in one man’s image that it becomes hard to envisage life without him? The one consolation for Ireland is that they’ll have plenty of time to work it out.",Sport/Sport,Sexton on fringes as long goodbye begins with final Twickenham win | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/13/johnny-sexton-on-fringes-as-long-goodbye-begins-with-final-twickenham-ireland-england-win
3/13/2022,"Ashley Walters has noticed that, much as day slides into night, his greatest career triumphs are followed, often at alarming speed, by his most humbling derailments. He arrived in the early 2000s as a rapper, Asher D, with the 30-strong London garage collective So Solid Crew. He was a lead vocalist on their No 1 hit 21 Seconds, and they won a Brit award in 2002, a prize perhaps overshadowed by the altercation they had with the Irish boyband Westlife’s table on the way up to collect it. A month later, aged 19, Walters was convicted of possession of a converted air pistol loaded with live ammunition and sentenced to 18 months in a young offender institution. Asher D returned not long afterwards as the electrifying actor Ashley Walters. He brought a powerful, lived intensity to his roles, especially in Top Boy, a drama about drug gangs in east London that is the closest British television has come to matching the detail and ambition of the landmark US drama The Wire. But then, in 2014, Channel 4 dropped the show after two series with no official explanation. Next, Walters teamed up with the actor-director Noel Clarke to make the buddy-cop action comedy Bulletproof. Its first episode in 2018 had a record audience for that year on Sky One, but after three successful series, that show, too, was cancelled after allegations of bullying and sexual harassment were made against Clarke by 20 women, as reported in the Guardian. We’ll return to Clarke later, but Walters, 39, seems to accept that his path will never be a totally straightforward one. Even now, he often can’t take roles in big American films and TV shows because his conviction makes it almost impossible for him to secure a visa. “I expect something crazy around the corner, that’s just how my life works,” he says. “I’m a sceptic on my own journey, and I get warned about that a lot, because you attract certain things when you think certain ways. But personally, I think it’s healthy to have a little bit of fear about what’s next.” Walters is sitting in a restaurant in Whitstable, on the Kent coast, on an apocalyptically rainy morning in February. He is compact, muscular, quick to smile and disarmingly open. He first started coming to the area on weekends – in part because he really likes oysters – and moved here from London with his wife, the actor Danielle Isaie, and their two young children in February 2021. It might look like a classic, Covid-lockdown, escape-the-city play, but Walters, an only child who was raised by his single mother on the North Peckham estate in southeast London, says it has been something he has wanted since he was young. “I’ve always had that dream of a big house, gates, just away from everything,” he says, sipping a cup of mint tea. “But it predominantly started when I came out of prison in the early 2000s. I saw London in a different light at that point. I’d had some amazing times with So Solid, a lot of success, but I realised how damaging it could be to you as a person, especially as a young Black man. And just understanding how people saw me a bit clearer. Having that prison experience and reading the papers about yourself, I was like, ‘Oh shit, I’m not as loved as I thought I was!’ It was a big ego dent.” This corner of Kent isn’t the most “diverse”, Walters notes, but the family are settling in well: the kids love the space and this morning Danielle, who played Candice in Michaela Coel’s Chewing Gum, is horse riding. “As soon as we moved in, we had cakes being brought to the door,” marvels Walters. “After the recent storm checking that we’re OK: ‘We noticed your gate’s blown off, do you want us to help you fix it?’ And for us, it’s like, ‘What do they want?’ Because you are just so not used to that in London.” Careerwise, the pieces seem to be falling into place again for Walters. Top Boy was revived by Netflix in 2019, initially at the somewhat unexpected behest of the Canadian musician Drake, and returns this month for a much-awaited fourth season. Walters takes the lead again as the astute drug kingpin Dushane, alongside on-off partner Sully, played by Kane Robinson, aka the rapper Kano. Walters is now in demand as a director, following an assured debut short film Boys, made last year for Sky. He’s also working on music again. Things are going well, in short, but maybe that’s what is making Walters nervous. “Like I said, my life has pretty much always been a boom-and-bust situation,” he says. “I have a real high and then I’ll be like, ‘What’s the next low?’ I know it’s coming, but I’ll enjoy this for now. Whatever comes, I’ll deal with it.” Growing up, Walters often felt he was living a double life. In the week, he’d hang out with friends in south London who had no idea that at weekends he was going to Marylebone to learn acting and dance at the Sylvia Young Theatre School. Walters kept the two worlds totally separate until he was busted when someone he knew was passing the London Palladium and saw him on the poster for Oliver! Walters joined So Solid Crew at 17, but even as a member of the most notorious band in Britain, there was an unlikely duality that only came crashing down when he was arrested. “For anyone, it would be a big wake-up call to have those jail doors slammed on you,” says Walters. “Looking at my mum’s face, she had no clue I was in such a bad place. And I was like, ‘Hold on, I was little Ashley at Sylvia Young, doing tap and ballet, making my mum proud. How have I ended up becoming the UK’s number one gun-toting gangster on the front page of the papers?’” When his sentence ended, Walters was reluctant to go back to being a rapper. “There was just problems everywhere,” he reasons. “People going to jail left, right and centre. Guns, drugs, this, that, whatever.” He was interested in acting and had a lucky break in 2004: the British director Saul Dibb was making a film, Bullet Boy, about a kid from London just out of prison who is desperate not to get sucked back into a life of crime. Walters poured his life experiences into the role, winning “most promising newcomer” at the British Independent Film Awards. From that, Walters was cast in Get Rich or Die Tryin’, the 2005 movie starring 50 Cent, which was shooting in Toronto. “When I got that job, I was on my face financially: I had two kids with my partner at the time and we were living in a council flat, mice running around,” he says. “In the space of a week, I was coming out of my apartment and Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck were there and getting in a lift. I was chauffeured everywhere, money in my bank every week. It was a life-changing experience. At that point, you’re like, ‘Oh, shit. This can work!’” While Walters was in Canada, he was contacted by his father. He had been largely absent when Walters was growing up: either in prison or with the other families he had. But now he had lung cancer and had only a few weeks to live. He wanted to spend time with him before he died. Walters, still resentful, said he wasn’t interested. His father didn’t listen and flew out to Toronto anyway. He phoned Walters from the airport and they had two weeks together in his apartment. “We connected,” recalls Walters. “He was on his deathbed, but he was still raving. The guy could hardly walk, he’d lost all this weight, but he was a charmer as well. There were all these Canadian women knocking for him on my apartment door that he’d met while I’d been at work during the day. I was like, ‘This guy! You’re dying, bro!’” At night, Walters turned “journalist”, asking his father to fill in the gaps in their lives. He’d ask about specific moments, like why had his dad promised to come on his seventh birthday and not shown up? Walters started to recognise that, in some respects, the apple had not fallen too far from the tree: he himself now has eight children, aged between 22 and five, from three relationships, and last year became a grandfather. “The more I hated him for having so many kids with so many different women, the more kids I had,” says Walters. “The more I hated him for being away from me as a child and his other kids while being in prison, I ended up in prison as well. All that resentment and hate was just killing me. At some point I had to realise, ‘Shit, what’s done is done. I can’t change the past, can’t rewrite history.’ What I can do is change what’s going to happen in the future. And how I affect my children growing up. So that was a big lesson learned.” On the flight back to London, his father caught pneumonia and died a day later. “I’m not good at grieving,” says Walters. “I’ve lost a lot of people and it’s gotten to the point where I can’t cry most of the time. But I’m just so happy that I got to develop some sort of relationship with him.” The tagline for the new series of Top Boy is “Loyalty Before Everything.” It’s a word that has resonance for Walters: “I’m loyal to a fault sometimes,” he says. And it’s clear it played on his mind when he heard the allegations against his friend Noel Clarke, which included sexual harassment, unwanted touching, sexually inappropriate comments on set, taking and sharing sexually explicit pictures and videos without consent, and bullying, between 2004 and 2019. “My relationship with Noel has always been… different,” says Walters, picking his words. “We became friends while doing that show [Bulletproof]. We weren’t friends before. And not for any of the reasons that he has been accused of, but he’s just always been a difficult person. He’s notoriously a bullish businessman – and has that reputation. And we butted heads a lot throughout that experience, but I learned to love him over that period of time, and we developed a really close relationship.” Walters is adamant that he never had any inkling of what Clarke has been accused of. “I just didn’t see any of it,” he says. “Whether that makes me a bit naive or stupid or whatever, I don’t know. But my first instinct was to question myself: ‘How could you let this happen? Where were you?’ Because I just wouldn’t be able to stomach any of that.” The day after the allegations, Walters posted on Instagram that he was “in shock and saddened”. He went on: “Sexual harassment, abuse and bullying have no place in our industry.” Walters was surprised to find that many of the replies were angry that he hadn’t given Clarke the benefit of the doubt. “When I brought out my statement, a lot of people that I know and love said that I shouldn’t have done it,” says Walters. “How can I leave him in the lurch like that? That’s your friend, he hasn’t been arrested. Innocent until proven guilty, all that stuff. “But my stance was, ‘Look, I don’t know whether he’s guilty or innocent, but I don’t like any of it and I don’t condone any of that stuff,’” Walters continues. “And I side with the women. Obviously, there’s a thing where women are scared to tell their story, so I applaud them for being brave enough to do this.” Last year was a challenging one for Walters in a few ways: a cousin died from Covid; another family member was killed in a car crash. The return to shooting Top Boy came as something of a welcome distraction. Walters jokes that he finds playing Dushane almost too easy: he’s so controlled, so Machiavellian, that he almost never has to get his hands dirty any more. “He’s a really intelligent character and I’m completely bored of playing him now,” says Walters, smiling. “It’s an ongoing thing on set where I’m like, ‘I just want to go and kill people. I just want to be the guy beating people up and doing all the heavy work.’ So sometimes it’s a lot less challenging than people would think.” Even after Channel 4 cancelled it, Walters always suspected Top Boy would return. “It never died down,” he says. “People just wouldn’t even accept I was doing something else. The minute I talk about: ‘I’ve got music coming out,’ it’s like, ‘We don’t care. When’s Top Boy out?’ ‘I’ve just had a new baby.’ ‘So what? When’s Top Boy coming out?’” Walters is aware that he should just enjoy being in a beloved hit show, but he still can’t silence a little voice in his head that says it won’t last. He and Kane Robinson message each other constantly, fearful that this will be the series that Top Boy loses its edge. “We send voice notes all day, every day, just about the show,” says Walters. “We’re that invested in it, and that worried about it: is this going to be the one where they catch us out and everyone goes, ‘It’s shit, we knew it’?” He stands up to leave, forgets his wife’s umbrella, remembers that she’ll be cross if he comes home without it, shakes his head. “I’m feeling good and positive about the future,” says Walters. “There will be things that crop up that are going to put spanners in the works and slow you down a bit. But it’s how I love to be.” Top Boy returns to Netflix on 18 March Fashion editor Helen Seamons; hair by Franklyn Nnamdi-Okwedy at F4fade barbers using Gamma Plus Tools; grooming by Tellica Roseway using Bobbi Brown; lighting and digital by Jem Rigby; fashion assistant Peter Bevan; shot at Luma Studios",Arts/Culture,"‘My life is all boom and bust’: Ashley Walters on Top Boy, his lost father and sudden wealth",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/13/ashley-walters-interview-top-boy-my-life-is-all-boom-and-bust
3/13/2022,"Politically speaking, Vladimir Putin is a dead man walking. As dictators always do, he has fatally over-reached. Bunker-bound and bonkers, there’s no way back into the world for him. At home, too, he looks increasingly isolated. But, militarily speaking, he’s not giving up. In Ukraine, the toxic president is going for bust. The worrying question: what will he do next? Insofar as Putin still has a plan, it is to bomb and batter the Ukrainian people into submission, by whatever means necessary, as quickly as possible. If that requires using chemical weapons, such as chlorine gas, as in Syria, who can doubt he will do so. Last week’s Mariupol maternity hospital war crime was a harbinger of worse, perhaps far worse, to come. Diplomats and analysts believe that, despite Ukraine’s unexpectedly effective resistance, Russia’s grip on the country is inexorably tightening. Vitali Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv, says the capital only has sufficient supplies for one or two weeks if attacked. Half the population has fled. If the allied powers sincerely want Ukraine to survive, time is running out. The west must now maximise pressure on Putin – military as well as economic – as a matter of utmost urgency. Ukraine’s citizens and soldiers cannot be expected to hold out for very much longer without increased, all-round support. Ukraine’s future as an independent democratic state may be decided in the coming fortnight. So, too, may be the future of Putinism in Russia itself. The oppressive, corrupt regime in Moscow that has blighted Russian lives for over 20 years, and spread fear and discord around the world, has never been weaker. This is a huge moment. Europe’s future security architecture could indeed be remodelled, as Russia has often urged, but on a post-Putin basis of cooperative, lawful, democratic co-existence, not a balance of terror. This tantalising prospect is offset by the risk of all-out conflict with a nuclear-armed tyrant who, hemmed in by his own miscalculations, may lash out wildly. Nato’s ill-judged refusal to provide any form of no-fly zone, as requested by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, or for example to create a UN-mandated safe zone on the ground in western Ukraine, stems from such fears. So what will Putin do? Three main scenarios are in view: a compromise peace deal; a stalemate; or a wider, escalating war. After two weeks of fighting, there is much talk of talks but no actual peace process. Dashing hopes it might intervene, China has kept its distance. Last week’s foreign ministers’ meeting in Turkey was a deliberate stalling exercise by Moscow. The two sides remain miles apart. Ukraine’s leaders will not agree to anything permanent while cities are besieged, vast swaths of their country are occupied, and heinous war crimes proliferate – and why should they? Nor is it likely that Putin will abandon his insistence that Ukraine remain separate from Nato and the EU, or give up his claims to Crimea and recently captured territory along the southern seaboard. Under a second scenario, the war drags on, degenerating into a Donbas-like stalemate or frozen conflict. This would suit no one. It would be disastrous for Ukraine’s citizens, both the displaced and those who remain; for Ukraine’s integrity as a nation state; for bogged-down, demoralised Russian forces facing determined insurgents; and for international relations and stability, endlessly polarised and poisoned by Ukraine-related tensions. Knowing this, and spurning peace, Putin is actively pursuing the third scenario: “doubling down” on military force, as CIA director William Burns put it last week, encircling cities, using hungry, freezing civilians as hostages, seizing more territory, and threatening a wider war, potentially involving chemical or even battlefield nuclear weapons. Here is the crux of the west’s dilemma. The US and UK are pumping increasingly advanced weaponry into Ukraine on a vast scale. British anti-tank missiles, for example, are reportedly proving grimly lethal. Now Starstreak anti-aircraft weapons are also being deployed, ostensibly for “defensive”, not “offensive”, purposes. Such sophistry aside, there can be no doubting where this massive Berlin airlift-type build-up is leading. Nato’s rejection of a no-fly zone and the US veto on supplying Polish MiG fighters to Ukraine’s air force cannot disguise the reality that the allies, de facto, are already party to this conflict or, in legal parlance, are “co-combatants”. Putin characterises sanctions as western economic warfare. How much longer before he declares that Russia is also under western military attack, and escalates accordingly? That’s the firm expectation in the Baltic republics – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – frontline former Soviet republics that Putin regards, like Ukraine, as not “real” countries. The Russian enclave of Kaliningrad is another looming flashpoint. Valdis Dombrovskis, a former Latvian prime minister, warned last week the Baltic states may be next in the firing line. “If we do not support Ukraine, it’s not going to stop in Ukraine… Unfortunately, it is likely this aggression will continue in other countries,” he said. Discussing Putin’s veiled nuclear threat, Dombrovskis, an EU commission vice-president, said the west must not be intimidated. “The question is, to what extent we are giving in to this blackmail because it can be used all the time against everything. Putin will continue his aggressive wars, he will always use this blackmail.” Plainly, there is no risk-free path through this horror. But any outcome that destroys a European democracy, or rewards Russian aggression, is unsustainable in the long term. That will only guarantee more grief down the road. Logically, practically, morally, the west really has no choice. Its leaders must now employ all possible levers – including the threat of direct military action – to stop Russia in its tracks in Ukraine, stop the mass murder of civilians, and stop the spread of the deadly Putin contagion.",Opinion/Opinion,Toxic Putin is going for bust.

3/13/2022,"How much do you have to like a movie’s protagonist to like a movie? That’s a question that rattled around my head as I watched Red Rocket, a comedy drama from Sean Baker, the American indie king behind empathic gems Tangerine (2015) and The Florida Project (2017). In both those life-affirmingly humane masterpieces, Baker showcased marginalised characters whose lives were presented in rich, textured hues. However flawed they might have been, they were easy to engage with. On its absurdist, slapstick surface, the antihero of Red Rocket is cut from similar cloth: an outsider with a survivor’s instinct and charisma to spare. Simon Rex is Mikey “Saber” Davies, a washed-up hustler who has been earning a living in the adult film industry in LA. Now it’s 2016 and he’s back in Texas City, bruised and banging on the door of his estranged wife, Lexi (Bree Elrod), and her mum, Lil (the late Brenda Deiss – one of the film’s many screen first-timers). “Why are you here?” they ask, prompting a scattershot cavalcade of self-justifying tall tales, all of which leave Mikey broke and homeless. But not for long. With his trademark toxic cocktail of insufferable charm and relentless selfishness, he has soon moved back in, assuring Lexi that “it’ll be like we’re still married”, to which she caustically replies: “We are still married.” Armed with a bicycle that bizarrely makes him resemble Pee-wee Herman, Mikey sets himself up dealing weed for Leondria (Judy Hill), selling to the hard hats at the local refinery who get to the end of a working day and “want to kill themselves”. He also inveigles his predatory way into the affections of Raylee (Suzanna Son), a 17-year-old (“I’ll be 18 in three weeks”) who works at the local Donut Hole and tells him: “Everybody calls me Strawberry.” Spying a ticket back to Hollywood, Mikey sets about grooming Raylee (who already has “a porn-star name”) into becoming his adult film paycheck protege. “That’s pretty impressive that in three weeks you convinced a girl to do porn,” enthuses neighbour Lonnie (Ethan Darbone) after Mikey brags: “I’ll have her shooting scenes by September.” No wonder Lexi accuses him of being a “suitcase pimp” – a porn industry term for a man who lives off female talent. Baker’s movies have always been about location, location, location, and Red Rocket is no different. From the belching refinery that provides an omnipresent backdrop to the scuffed green lawns and DayGlo-coloured businesses (such as the tangerine-and-puce combo of the Donut Hole), scenery is front and centre. Time and again, cinematographer Drew Daniels – whose CV includes Trey Edward Shults’s paranoid horror It Comes at Night and broken-backed drama Waves – captures these characters as small figures in an ultrawide, oversaturated frame, engulfed by their surroundings. In one key scene the sound and vision of a passing train all but obliterates the dialogue, while the skin-crawling voice of Donald Trump provides background TV noise in a land beset by Maga billboards. Through it all, Mikey’s self-serving, hyper-energetic patter rattles on – initially entertaining, but ever-more poisonous. Rex – an actor/rapper/comedian/model who apparently dabbled in porn in the 90s – does a terrific job of capturing Mikey’s creepy charm, showing us how he’s hustled his way through life in reliably unreliable form (“Nothing with you is unexpected,” says Lexi). But Mikey is also past his prime, popping blue pills to get it up, capable of intimacy in only the most performative fashion. As everyone around him discovers, he’s a Trumpy huckster who cares for nobody but himself. As for Baker and regular co-writer Chris Bergoch, they refrain from judging their characters, observing the world from Mikey’s maniacally self-serving point of view even as comedy turns to queasiness and worse. When things get really nasty in Red Rocket, the audience is left unsure whether to laugh or groan. Indeed, I suspect that some viewers may be so seduced by Mikey that they won’t find it “nasty” at all. That’s an alarming thought, but one that suits a portrait of someone who takes the blame for nothing (“You did this, not me”), and who believes that “the universe is on my side”, whatever wreckage they may leave in their wake.",Arts/Film,"Red Rocket review – Sean Baker’s queasy comedy of a predatory, past-it porn actor",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/13/red-rocket-review-sean-baker-predatory-past-it-porn-star
3/13/2022,"Leading up to the Winter Paralympics opening ceremony there were doubts Ukraine’s team of 20 athletes would reach China and the prospect that even if they made it they could be sharing podiums with Russian athletes even as Russian tanks rolled towards Kyiv. The International Paralympic Committee’s (IPC) late U-turn to ban Russia avoided that scenario and after a fraught four-day journey and an emotional entrance into the Bird’s Nest stadium in Beijing the Ukraine team has gone on to all but ensure they will finish second in the medal table, the highest position since they started competing as an independent country in 1996. Before there was any sporting action, the Ukrainian Paralympic Committee (UPC) president, Valeriy Sushkevych, told reporters it was a “miracle” they were there. “Not coming here would have been taking the easy option. Our presence at the Paralympics is a sign that Ukraine is and will remain a country.” Once the action began, the medals in biathlon and cross-country kept on coming. Going into the final day of the Games, Ukraine had amassed 10 gold, 10 silver and eight bronze in the two sports, their highest haul. With the medals came the heartfelt words. “I tried thinking about the competition, but today it’s difficult. What’s more important is life. It’s our people, our children,” said Grygorii Vovchynskyi after he won the men’s standing sprint biathlon on the first full day of competition at the National Biathlon Centre in Zhangjiakou. Oksana Shyshkova has won three gold medals and two silver medals in Beijing, but asked on the opening Saturday of the Games what her medal hopes were after clinching victory in her opening race, she said: “I do not have any hopes, I just want peace for Ukraine.” On Thursday, the entire Ukraine delegation staged a peace protest in the Paralympic village. After holding up a banner saying “Peace for all” and observing a minute’s silence for victims of the war, Sushkevych said: “This one minute is about the thousands of people, including children and others with disabilities, back in Ukraine. If mankind is civilised, then this war must be stopped. People, women and children deserve to live, not die.” Even though the war is thousands of miles away at home, the impact could be felt very directly in Beijing. Anastasiia Laletina, 19, pulled out of her middle-distance biathlon event after she received news that her father, a solider in the Ukrainian army, had been taken prisoner by Russian armed forces. She competed in one event on Friday. After winning a silver medal on Tuesday, Oleksandra Kononova, 31, said: “Despite that I’m physically here and competing, all my thoughts, my heart and my soul is with my family and with my child.” Dmytro Suiarko won a bronze medal in the men’s vision impaired middle-distance biathlon despite receiving reports that his home in Chernihiv, about 90 miles north of Kyiv, had been destroyed by Russian shelling. Seven of Ukraine’s Paralympic delegation live in Kharkiv. Liudmyla Liashenko, who won three medalshas no home to go back to after it was bombed. These are not entirely uncharted waters for Ukraine’s Paralympics team. Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014 took place in the interval between Sochi hosting the Winter Olympics and then staging the Winter Paralympics. On that occasion the UPC staged a symbolic protest by sending only one athlete to the opening ceremony, but there was nothing like the way the international sporting community has rallied around them this year and the Games went ahead in Sochi even as the Russian annexation unfolded. Ukraine’s success is not a total bolt out of the yellow and blue either. The country has a tradition of excelling at Paralympic sports and Ukraine has been in the top six of the medals table in every Summer and Winter Paralympics since 2004. Their haul this time around has undoubtedly been boosted by the absence of Russian competitors, especially in the biathlon. In Pyeongchang, Russian athletes, competing as a neutral team owing to doping violations, took five gold and 11 medals in that discipline. Nearly all those podium spots have been filled with Ukrainians, including three podium sweeps, two of the them led by the 43-year-old Vitaliy Lukyanenko, who said after one of his victories: “I’m really proud that today we can raise the Ukrainian flag in Beijing, so each and every person can see the flag once again.” Craig Spence, an IPC spokesperson, has speculated that the team’s story has all the makings of a future movie and they have earned words of praise Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In an address on Friday he told his country: “The victories of Ukraine for all of us are worth their weight in gold or silver or bronze. And all this is successfully won by our Paralympians in Beijing. Today, everyone is gaining glory for Ukraine in his or her place. It shows the world who Ukrainians are and what strength we have, with a weapon in hands on the battlefield or with a sporting rifle on a biathlon track.” The Ukrainian team face an uncertain future when they return from Beijing. The plan is for them to fly to Poland at the end of the Games. From there, who knows what next. They have, though, written an unforgettable chapter in Paralympics history and conducted themselves with a grace and dignity under incredible pressure in the worst of circumstances.",Sport/Sport,A ‘miracle’ in Beijing: Ukraine unbowed at Winter Paralympics,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/13/a-miracle-in-beijing-ukraine-unbowed-at-winter-paralympics
3/13/2022,"Roman Abramovich is not unusual. This is worth emphasising. Rich as he may be, and as politically connected as befits an ex-governor of a Russian province, Abramovich’s 18 years as owner of Chelsea is just the best known example of the ways in which economic power and political actors have come to shape and dominate global football. Consider, beyond Abramovich, how Vladimir Putin’s regime has used the game. Russia’s leading clubs have been allocated to allied oligarchs, state companies and local warlords, such as Chechnya’s president, Ramzan Kadyrov. Football ultras have been recruited as muscle for ersatz youth movements and intimidating political opponents. Other pliant, unsanctioned oligarchs who still own foreign clubs include Dmitry Rybolovlev at Monaco and Club Brugge and Ivan Savvidis, president of Thessaloniki’s PAOK. State-owned Gazprom has sponsored Fifa and Uefa, as well as Chelsea, Schalke 04 and Red Star Belgrade, three clubs in politically important markets for the company. And, the jewel in the crown, Russia won the hosting rights to the 2018 World Cup and put on a sporting Potemkin village that obscured both domestic protest over its disastrous pension reforms, and its own international malevolence. Russia is not alone in this. In the past 20 years, football, never short of political suitors, has in much of the world been colonised by political power and projects. Why have the world’s states, politicians and political movements shown such an unprecedented interest in the game? Money is a factor for some. Consider the former Honduran president Rafael Callejas, who attempted to financially secure his retirement by becoming the president of the Honduran Football Association, an institution even more corrupt and opaque than the office of head of state, by taking huge bribes from broadcasters. Football is also the perfect place to launder yet more money. Russian organised criminals bought small Portuguese clubs for precisely this purpose, while Colombian and Mexican football remain awash with drug money. Football, however, offers many things more alluring than mere graft or money-changing options. At a minimum, association with the game delivers profile and local popularity. More substantially, it offers established popular arenas for playing political theatre, ready-made and ritualised local identities to piggyback upon, and a source of malleable narratives to garnish political progress. Correctly used, it can do so not just for local or national politicians, but for nation states on the global stage. Consequently, many politicians have systematically incorporated football fandom into their carefully constructed public personas and football metaphors into their language, like presidents Lula, Ahmadinejad, Mugabe and Erdoğan. Silvio Berlusconi and Mauricio Macri began their political ascents as presidents of AC Milan and Boca Juniors respectively. Others have actually played the game professionally while in power, like Bolivia’s Evo Morales or Hungary’s Viktor Orbán. The perceptible rise in politicians’ engagement with the game has not been merely tub-thumping nationalism or an exercise in personal grandstanding – though there has been plenty of both of those – but has increasingly made football an object of state intervention. Taking a leaf out of Putin’s book, the Aliyevs, the post-Soviet ruling dynasty in Azerbaijan, have sought to counter international opprobrium for their dismal human rights record with pharaonic stadium projects, hosting games at last year’s European football championships and the 2019 Europa League final and using the state oil company to sponsor Uefa and Atlético Madrid. In Hungary and Turkey, publicly funded, multibillion-pound programmes of stadium redevelopment have been used by Orbán and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to help nurture a new class of allied construction and real-estate oligarchs, and both have acquired, in effect, their own football clubs, Puskás Akadémia and Istanbul Başakşehir. Latin America is wearisomely familiar with the political uses of football and the 21st century has seen a short-lived Chavista takeover of Venezuelan football and a bitter 10-year battle between left and right over the nationalisation and then privatisation of domestic football’s television rights. However, the real ambition is in Asia, where even the small teams can dream. After deciding against using public money to buy Manchester United, Myanmar’s junta ordered the country’s richest men to create and fund a Myanmar premier league. In China, where Xi Jinping’s “three wishes” – qualifying for, hosting and winning the men’s World Cup – have become official national priorities, a gigantic school football programme has been initiated to make it happen. The UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, who each own a major European football club, are spending heavily on football sponsorships and carry considerable influence at Fifa, Uefa and in Asian football too. In Qatar, the game is the single most important instrument in the state’s programme of economic and urban development and the most powerful plank in its foreign policy of visibility. What appears so remarkable about this is that, like Abramovich’s arrival at Chelsea, it has, for the most part, been waved through, even welcomed, nowhere more obviously than the Premier League’s acceptance of Saudi state ownership at Newcastle United while the brutal war in Yemen continues to rage. The world’s football federations and leagues have blithely accepted all of this, despite continuing to mouth the “sport and politics don’t mix” pieties of the 19th century. Even where they do have to face the political realties of our age, they are equipped with neither the legitimacy nor the legal or political instatement to do much about it – our own leagues, for example, persist with “a fit and proper person’s test” designed to exclude small-time fraudsters, not global powers. None of this would matter very much if football had not become the singularly most important space in global popular culture. None of this would matter if sportswashing did not work, and football did not buy influence, but they do, as demonstrated so accurately by the Chelsea fans who chanted Abramovich’s name while others showed solidarity with Ukraine’s plight. So what is to be done? We could start with a shift to the social ownership of all football clubs. We could insist on the strictest financial and legal regulations of football institutions. We could demand real transparency and accountability from national and international football federations, the empowerment of players and supporters and their deeper democratisation. Politics is not leaving football in the near future. The question is: what kind of politics do we want?

3/13/2022,"Starting from scratch with this year’s models, the sweeping changes in regulations are based on an attempt to shift a significant amount of downforce generation from aerodynamic parts to the floor of the car, through the use of ground effect. The intent is to push the wash of dirty air upwards, away from following cars so they can better close on one another. Intriguingly, the interpretation of the rules has varied across the paddock, not least with Mercedes’s radical sidepod design, already catching attention and potentially protests at its legality. Some will have got it right, but for those who have chosen the wrong path a long season of furious catch-up awaits. The main purpose of these new designs and the exhaustive work Formula One put in over four years into drafting the rules is to improve opportunities for overtaking. If they work, cars should be able to move up to make a pass, avoiding the loss of downforce that turbulent air creates, though their ability to slipstream will also have been diminished. Early signs from testing were that there was cautious optimism from the drivers and some scepticism from engineers but the success or otherwise (do not expect DRS to disappear any time soon) of F1’s efforts will not be truly seen until race day in Bahrain. Pirelli is bringing in an entirely new tyre this season, switching from the 13-inch wheels used in F1 for more than three decades. This year the cars feature 18-inch wheels, the wider diameter bringing them into line with road cars, and the tyres are larger but with a smaller sidewall. Once more, here the hope is they will flex less, increasing stability and reducing overheating when drivers attempt to overtake. Pirelli expects the degradation rate to fall as well – potentially reducing many races to one-stops – while in search of aerodynamic efficiency wheel covers will return for the first time since 2009. Lap records look to be safe this season, with the new cars set to be the heaviest yet, moving from 752kg to 790kg, a factor of the bigger wheels and new stringent safety standards. The chassis strength requirements have been increased by almost 50%, making them able to absorb higher energy impacts from the front, rear and side. Also included in a swathe of new safety measures, the nose has been made longer after the investigation into Anthoine Hubert’s fatal F2 crash at Spa in 2019, while after Romain Grosjean’s horrific fiery accident at Bahrain in 2020, the power unit must be able to break away from the chassis without rupturing the fuel tank. Sprint qualifying, trialled last year, returns but has been tweaked for the better. It will be held at three races, in Imola, Austria and Brazil, with qualifying on a Friday still deciding the sprint grid, but now the quickest driver in qualifying will be credited with having taken pole position. The 100km race on the Saturday will then decide the grid for Sunday’s GP but, rather than just last season’s top three, the top eight will be awarded points, from eight to one, with the intent of making it worthwhile for drivers genuinely to make a race of it on the Saturday. If the cancelled Russian race is replaced as planned we will have 23 grands prix, the longest season yet, but as a result the race weekend has been shortened. Practice still takes place on a Friday but the two one-hour sessions will be held in the afternoon, with scrutineering and media work taking place on Friday morning. The aim is to reduce the burden on teams, with the potential of the calendar increasing to 25 races in the next two years, but its efficacy is already being questioned. Many teams say their crews will still have to be at circuits on Thursdays, as will many drivers to carry out sponsor commitments, while Friday is turning into a very long day indeed for engineers and mechanics.",Sport/Sport,F1 2022: six things to look forward to in the new season,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/13/six-things-that-will-change-in-formula-one-this-season
3/13/2022,"It’s that time of year when we are about to be subjected to a huge number of speeches. It’s awards season. This evening will see the Bafta winners take to the stage and breathlessly say their heartfelt thank yous. It’s always a wonderful thing to see a human being shine with joy and share their emotion. Until you get past the 20th category. This is where things can get long. When the thank yous start hitting the four- to five-minute mark, what was a fun celebration can quickly turn into a hostage situation with a strong possibility of developing deep vein thrombosis. No fancy awards ceremony wants to be giving out long-haul flight socks and a blood thinner to their guests. That’s why I fully support the decision by the organisers of this year’s Oscars to instruct all nominees to keep their speeches short and sweet. They have even advised winners not to mention their agents or managers. They’re right. Where does it all lead to? Channelling Gwyneth Paltrow, weeping while thanking your dad’s butcher’s chiropodist. No! I don’t care how painful those bunions were. I regularly host awards ceremonies and they can be great fun, but the producers are very strict. Winners rarely get to make an acceptance speech on the grounds that we only have the room until midnight. There’s usually a nice, slick film about all the nominees, the winner’s name is read out by me or a guest presenter, they come on to the stage, get a shiny trophy and have a photograph taken to rapturous applause and Uptown Funk playing very loudly. It’s all very jolly and, most importantly, pacey, so the audience stays engaged, which is critical to a good awards ceremony. Now I’m not suggesting these glitzy awards should stop winners making a speech, but every nominee should be reminded of Joe Pesci who holds the record for the shortest acceptance speech in Oscars history simply by saying five words: “It’s my privilege. Thank you.” The audience had barely finished clapping and he was off. Ninety seconds is plenty of time to get your thank yous done. But producers need to be brutal about the 90-second rule. We creative egos need reining in at times and the threat of shaming us is the only language we understand. I’m not quite making the argument for a trapdoor on stage, but every nominee plus their agents and managers (who aren’t getting thanked) need to get a very stern memo saying that there is a hard stop after 90 seconds, and that some very loud music will start playing even if you are busy thanking your primary school teacher. It may even be Uptown Funk. There is also the peril of actors deciding to use their acceptance speech to make what they think is an epoch-changing political point that will go down in history. It will, but probably for the wrong reason. I understand how frustrated we all are about literally everything on this bin-fire planet right now, but we really don’t need your hot take on geopolitics, Julian Assange or electoral reform. Boris Johnson is not going to fall because of your withering put-down on refugees (which I’ll agree with) and Putin isn’t going to call it a day as a result of you calling him a wrong ’un after you’ve thanked your pilates instructor. Yes, people will want to send solidarity to the people of Ukraine but big political speeches rarely work at an awards do. In 2004, while picking up his first best actor award, Sean Penn made an “edgy” political gag about the missing weapons of mass destruction in Iraq which died on its arse. There are, of course, powerful moments, often when there are historical firsts or nominees from under-represented groups break through, such as Halle Berry winning best actress for Monster’s Ball at the Oscars in 2002. She was in tears even before she reached the stage because she knew she stood on the shoulders of so many black actresses and she dedicated the award to them. “This moment is so much bigger than me …. And it’s for every nameless, faceless woman of colour that now has a chance because this door tonight has been opened.” Since then no woman of colour has won best actress, although six have won best supporting actress. Sixteen years later, Frances McDormand used her winner’s speech in 2018 (best actress for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri) to make the case once again for diversity in the industry and call for inclusion riders. Clapping and cheering in the room doesn’t necessarily mean change happens fast. We love these awards shows because of the glitz, glamour and stardust. We want to see our favourites ooze charisma and humour even when things go wrong. Jennifer Lawrence suffered the mortification of tripping up the stairs to the stage to collect the best actress award for Silver Linings Playbook in 2013. She was super quick on her feet – after she got back up on them – and in response to the standing ovation quipped, “You guys are just standing up because you feel bad that I fell, and that’s really embarrassing, but thank you. This is nuts.” Grace, charm and wit. That’s what we want.",Arts/Culture,"No tears, blather or preaching: how to make the perfect awards ceremony speech",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/13/no-tears-blather-or-preaching-baftas-award-best-speech
3/13/2022,"In July 1995, when I was 25 years old and working as a reporter on a local newspaper in the north of England, I made my first trip to America, by inveigling my way on to a junket for business journalists to Boston. On the last day of the trip, I jettisoned the itinerary and set out before dawn for the small town of Lowell, 30 miles away. Lowell is the town in Massachusetts where writer Jack Kerouac is buried and where, a century ago this weekend, he was born. I’d discovered Kerouac about four years earlier, when I read On the Road, during a long coach journey to the bull-running festival of St Fermín in Pamplona, Spain, and then hoovered up his dozen or more roman à clef novels and books of poetry and dream, anything I could get my hands on. I was a fan. I felt some kind of kinship with Kerouac I couldn’t explain. Maybe the working-class roots, the auto-didactic magpie-like gathering of knowledge. He had aspirations to be a journalist, writing articles for his university paper at Columbia. He dropped out of college after a year, following a football injury; I never went to university. He died, in 1969, 82 days before I was born. I took drugs on top of a mountain in the Lake District, echoing Kerouac’s summer as a fire-watcher on Desolation Peak, and wondered if I might be a reincarnation of him. Kerouac seems equally revered and despised, for his jazz-infused spontaneous prose largely plotless novels, for his often contradictory lifestyle. In 1993, midway between me discovering On The Road aged 21 and going to visit Kerouac’s birthplace, Gap used him in an advertising campaign to sell their khaki trousers. The same year saw the BBC TV adaptation of Hanif Kureishi’s 1990 novel, The Buddha of Suburbia, in which social climber Eva chides protagonist Karim for reading Kerouac, quoting Truman Capote’s dismissive “that’s not writing, it’s typing”, and opining, “The cruellest thing you can do to Kerouac is re-read him at 38.” Kerouac’s works often make it on to lists of red-flag books that, if you see on the shelf of a man you are dating, you should run a mile. The consensus seems to be that Kerouac is a thing for callow youths, to be grown out of, to be reassessed in maturity and found wanting. And yet, here I am, more distance now between here and my visit to Kerouac’s grave than there was between me standing in the scorching July heat looking at the flat gravestone bearing his childhood nickname Ti Jean in Edson cemetery and Kerouac’s death in Florida. Here I am, arguing that Kerouac is more relevant than ever as we mark 100 years since his birth. It’s Kerouac’s complex life, his contradictory views, his duality in so many things, that gives him more cachet than ever. Brought up a Catholic, he adopted a cherry-picked hybrid Buddhist spirituality, shot through with grief after the death of his older brother Gerard, aged just nine, who Kerouac revered as a saint. He advocated freedom, abandonment of responsibility, heading out into the mystic night of a magical America where the land bulged on the horizon into infinity, yet he never cut the apron strings, eventually dying while living with his mother. Although ever the dutiful son, he was an absent father to his daughter Jan, even denying his paternity. In his 20s Kerouac devoured Das Kapital and read the Daily Worker, and poet Allen Ginsberg said he was “overtly communistic”. By the end of his life he was supporting the Vietnam war and when his former road-buddy Neal Cassady, now riding with Ken Kesey’s acid-imbibing Merry Pranksters, visited him, Kerouac sombrely took the American flag one of the hippies was wearing as a cape and reverently folded it up. Kerouac was married three times, and his portrayal of women in his works is derisory at best, reducing them to cardboard cutouts to facilitate sex or express maternalism. Yet he is widely thought to have had same-sex liaisons, and repressed his feelings for men all his life. Jack Kerouac is a hot mess, in other words. And, really, aren’t we all? Does anyone know who or what they’re meant to be in the modern world? Gender is increasingly fluid, identity is a shifting concept, labels are meaningless. Never mind selling khakis, it’s time, a century after his birth, that we made Kerouac a poster boy for the gloriously mixed-up, indefinable, shifting-sand landscape of 2022.",Arts/Books,Jack Kerouac: still roadworthy after 100 years ,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/13/jack-kerouac-still-roadworthy-after-100-years
3/13/2022,"During the more than a decade that I have spent working for foreign policy thinktanks in Europe and the United States, I have been pretty hawkish on China and Russia. At the time when most foreign policy experts on both sides of the Atlantic believed that economic interdependence with China and Russia would turn them into “responsible stakeholders” in the international system, and perhaps even democratise them, I thought a tougher approach was needed. I was a particular critic of Germany, which had gone even further than the rest of Europe (which, in turn, had gone further than the US) in its belief in Wandel durch Handel, or “change through trade”. I criticised Germany’s free riding in security terms, especially its low level of defence spending and inadequate military capabilities and its dependence on Russia for gas and China as an export market. In short, I am neither a pacifist nor someone who equivocates about authoritarian states. However, since the war in Ukraine started, I have suddenly been out-hawked. As we have all watched the horrible images from Ukraine, outrage has grown about the war crimes being committed by the Russian military. As the calls for us to do more to help the Ukrainian people have become louder, I have found myself on the doveish side of the debate, arguing for de-escalation and ways out rather than further commitments to Ukraine and regime change in Russia. Here is how I think about what has happened. Since the Russian annexation of Crimea and the invasion of Donbas in 2014, we have tried to deter Vladimir Putin from going further in Ukraine or elsewhere in central and eastern Europe. There was an economic component of the strategy (sanctions) and a military component (the reinforcement of Nato forces in Poland and the Baltic states and training for the Ukrainian military, in which the UK played a leading role). However, we were half-hearted. On the military side, the US rightly made it clear it would not defend Ukraine as if it were a Nato ally – there are, after all, good reasons why it is not one. Meanwhile, on the economic side, Europe continued to depend on Russian gas, which was deliberately excluded from the sanctions. In fact, Germany doubled down with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was agreed a year later. Just over two weeks ago, Putin called our bluff. He looked at what we were threatening to do if he invaded Ukraine and apparently decided it was a risk he was willing to take. (Of course, it is possible that he might have invaded even if we had gone further with deterrence.) If Russia is surprised at how tough and united we have been in response to the invasion, that is not a success but a failure. It means deterrence didn’t work because we failed to convince Russia that we would be that tough and united – and this should be our starting point in thinking about what to do next. We are in an unprecedented and extremely difficult situation. But it seems to me that we have to pivot. The aim must be to do all we can to avoid a further escalation (while taking seriously the possibility that Putin may himself escalate, for example, through the use of chemical or even nuclear weapons), and to end the war. But instead, experts in Europe and the US are urging all kinds of economic, political and military steps whose consequences we have barely begun to think through and that have the potential to drag Nato into a war with Russia. “How in no time the west has gone from targeted sanctions to financial war against the post-Soviet economic space, without unified aims nor clear conditions for lifting restrictions, all while an impetuous nuclear-armed tyrant is waging a war of aggression, is quite terrifying,” tweeted Nicholas Mulder, a historian at Cornell University and author of The Economic Weapon, a history of sanctions, four days after the war began. Since then, there have also been calls to increase military support to Ukraine. Last Sunday, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said that Poland had a “green light” to supply its MiG-29 fighters to Ukraine. On Tuesday, Poland said it would send them to Ramstein air base in Germany to be refitted, which the US then rejected. What was worrying was that everybody, including the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, seemed to imply that supplying fighters to Ukraine was up to individual countries rather than a decision to be taken collectively by Nato. Watching this frantic scramble to do something, it is hard to avoid the feeling that what is happening is overcompensation. We are all feeling guilty about our mistakes which are suddenly glaringly apparent – Germany’s persistent dependence on Russian gas, the UK’s persistent failure to deal with Russian money laundering. We are rapidly taking dramatic steps that we resisted for years, but without a clear sense of what we are trying to achieve and in a completely different and much more dangerous situation than the one before the war started. At this fraught moment, the biggest danger is recklessness. One source of this is a kind of resurgent neoconservatism in Britain and the US. Even before the war began, both were increasingly framing international politics as a global struggle between democracy and authoritarianism. As the Ukrainians have resisted with extraordinary bravery and skill, the Russian military’s ineptness has been exposed. And as it has resorted to even more brutal methods against civilians, many experts now sense the possibility of finally removing Putin from power. For some in the Biden administration, this is revenge for Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. More surprisingly, however, there is also a danger of recklessness by the European Union. After a decade of crises, many of which remain unresolved, the EU aspires to be “geopolitical” – officials talk endlessly about the need for the EU to “learn the language of power”. The Ukraine crisis once again revealed the EU’s weaknesses. But since the war began it has been hyperactive, imposing sanctions on the Russian central bank before the US and even supplying weapons to Ukraine. It was also Josep Borrell, the EU high representative for foreign affairs, who first announced the plan to send fighter jets to Ukraine two weeks ago – an illustration of how dangerous the EU’s desperation to be “geopolitical” is. In addition to sanctions and supplying weapons, many experts are also urging the EU to fast-track the accession process for Ukraine. Yet the Kremlin sees both Nato and the EU as part of the same US-led project and has made it clear that Putin will do anything to stop Ukraine from integrating further into either. After all, the catalyst for the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 was a proposed association agreement between the EU and Ukraine. Further steps to integrate Ukraine risk a further Russian response, a possibility we do not seem to want even to discuss, because we believe that Ukraine ought to be able to choose its own destiny. Apart from the risk of escalation, there is something else troubling about the EU’s embrace of Ukraine. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen – the figure who embodies the idea of a “geopolitical” EU – recently that said that Ukraine was “one of us”. That statement was indicative of a wider tendency in the west to frame this conflict in civilisational terms. Countless reporters and commentators have expressed shock that such a brutal conflict could have happened in “civilised” Europe – as opposed to the uncivilised world beyond. In particular, many people seem to feel sympathy for the Ukrainians because they “look like us”. A few days after the war started, one senior Ukrainian official even told the BBC that what made the situation so emotional for him was that it was “European people with blue eyes and blond hair” who were being killed. The EU’s generous approach to refugees from Ukraine, led by Poland, which in the refugee crisis in 2015 was one of the European countries most vehemently opposed to accepting asylum seekers from Syria and Afghanistan, also seems to have been influenced by a sense of ethnic solidarity. The civilisational way in which this conflict has been framed may help to explain why so many outside the west do not see this war as their fight – for example, India, which abstained in the vote to condemn the Russian invasion in the UN security council two weeks ago. There and elsewhere beyond the west, many people look on at the war in Ukraine in something like the way that WEB Du Bois reacted to the outbreak of the First World War. War is horrible, he wrote, but has it only just become horrible now that it is white people who are being killed?

3/13/2022,"On 7 December 1691, a precious rune drum, created to help a noaidi, or shaman, to enter a trance and walk among spirits, was confiscated by the authorities. The owner, Anders Poulsson – or Poala-Ánde in the name’s Sámi form – was tried for witchcraft the following year. Poulsson told the court, according to official records, that his mother had taught him how to use the rune drum, because “he wanted to help people in distress, and with his art he wanted to do good, and his mother said that she would teach him such an art”. Before a verdict was reached, he was murdered, with an axe, by a man who had “taken leave of his senses”. Poulsson’s drum entered the Danish royal collection, and later became the property of the National Museum of Denmark – until now. The drum has officially been handed back to the Sámi people, after what Jelena Porsanger, director of the Sámi Museum in Karasjok, northern Norway, called “a 40-year struggle”. An indigenous people of northern Europe, the Sámi inhabit Sapmi, a territory straddling northern Norway, Finland, Sweden and Russia’s Kola peninsula. “It’s a precious object for us that is a symbol of our history, values and culture – and at the same time a symbol of colonisation and unequal power relations,” said Porsanger. The drum had been on loan to the museum since 1979, but earlier attempts formally to regain ownership had been rebuffed. Last year, Norway’s Sámi president appealed to Queen Margrethe of Denmark over the issue, hoping she would act as “the conscience of the Danish people”. “For us these objects are not about collections, or representing a historical period,” said Porsanger. “They are not material objects. We think of them as humans, as persons.” It is the first Sámi drum to be repatriated from abroad and the only one in the collection in Karasjok. Now undergoing conservation, the drum will go on display as the centrepiece of a new exhibition on 12 April. The formal handover of the object is an event of huge significance, according to Sámi film-maker Silja Somby, who is making a film about rune drums to be shown during the Venice Biennale in August. They are, she said, “like bibles for us. Each has its own special meanings and symbolisms”. The largest single collection of more than 30 is held at the Nordiska Museet, Stockholm; there are examples too in Berlin, Leipzig, Hamburg and Rome, as well as in the British Museum and Cambridge University’s Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (MAA). The Sámi population numbers about 60,000 to 70,000, of whom about 25,000 speak any one of nine surviving (and related) Sámi languages. Rune drums were once a central aspect of their nature-based religious life. When a noaidi struck a reindeer-skin and birchwood rune drum with a reindeer-antler hammer, a brass ring would move across its surface. Depending on how the ring moved in relation to the symbols on the drum (painted in a red dye made from alder resin), the noaidi would divine future events. The drumming would also help the noaidi enter a trance and travel in different realities, for example among the spirits of the dead. At the time Poulsson’s drum was confiscated, the Sámi were being aggressively Christianised, and he was brought to trial in February 1692 “on the grounds that he has owned and used an instrument they call a rune drum with which he has practised that wicked and ungodly art of witchcraft”. Since Norway was at the time of the Denmark-Norway union, effectively ruled from Copenhagen, it was to Copenhagen that the drum was sent. Poulsson’s evidence survives – he even demonstrated the use of the drum to the court. He also explained the drum’s symbology, though according to recent scholars the framing of his account in broadly Christian terms may have been an attempt to tell the court what it wanted to hear. For example, naming one human figure depicted on the drum as Diermis, he said that: “When God is prayed to, Diermis is helpful in that when there are floods and a lot of rain, he will call back the weather, and this Diermis has no power unless God gives it to him.” On the figure of a reindeer whom he referred to as Gvodde, he said: “when God is prayed to, [Gvodde] gives good fortune in the hunt for wild reindeer. If the rune drum is beaten, and the ring will not dance for this reindeer, the one who asks for good hunting will not get any reindeer, no matter how hard he tries.” According to Porsanger, the present Karasjok Sámi Museum is unsuitable for the housing of a large number of objects as vulnerable as the drum – it is too small, with inadequate storage facilities and atmospheric control. “We are looking at plans for a new museum,” she said. “Hopefully we will realise the dream.” The museum, she said, has made no further requests for repatriation of drums, but, she added: “We have the stories, the language and the terminology, which we would love to share with other museums if they would listen.” In May, she confirmed, she is planning to visit UK institutions that hold Sámi material, including the British Museum and the MAA, as well as the Horniman Museum in London and the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford. The last owns Sámi-related items collected by Sir Arthur Evans, most famous as the excavator of Knossos, who visited northern Finland in 1873. Somby is uncompromising in her desire for repatriation of Sámi items, however. “There is momentum building now,” she said, mentioning the drums in Sweden and Germany. “First we take Berlin – then we take London.”",News/Science,"Three centuries on, a shaman’s precious rune drum returns home",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/13/three-centuries-on-a-shamans-precious-rune-drum-returns-home
