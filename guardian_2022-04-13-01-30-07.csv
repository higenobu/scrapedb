4/13/2022,"Three victims of organised grooming gangs in Rochdale have received “substantial” damages and an apology from a police chief who accepted his force had let the women down. The three women, who have lifelong anonymity, met Stephen Watson, the chief constable of Greater Manchester police (GMP), at the force headquarters on Tuesday to be given the apology in person. It comes a decade after a high-profile trial in which members of a child exploitation gang were found guilty and jailed for their involvement in a horrifying case that prompted a national debate. Kate Ellis, a solicitor with the Centre for Women’s Justice (CWJ), said the public apology and settled damages claims represented a “landmark moment” after what was a protracted battle. “It really felt for a long time that it was a war of attrition,” she said. In his apology to the women, Watson said: “It is a matter of profound personal regret that your childhood was so cruelly impacted by the dreadful experiences which you endured. GMP could, and should, have done much more to protect you and we let you down. “I hope that it will come as some little comfort to know that our confronting our failures in this regard, means that it is altogether less likely that others will suffer as you did. We will strive to keep improving our responses to similarly horrible circumstances, to prevent the same from happening in the first instance, and relentlessly pursuing perpetrators so that they can be held fully to account.” Concerns about the grooming and sex trafficking of predominately white working-class girls by predominately Asian men began to be raised in the early 2000s. One of the women receiving the apology is known as Daisy. She was 12 when she was first subjected to abuse, which, over a number of years, included rape and serious sexual assault. She was also the victim of numerous other physical assaults. Daisy told police about the abuse on a number of occasions between 2005 and 2008. The allegations were ignored and she was treated as a troublemaker and petty criminal, her lawyers say, and still has a criminal record that she will have to disclose for some jobs. In a statement she said she did not know if she believed GMP had changed its ways. “But I’m happy that they’ve taken into account their failings and there’s finally been some accountability. It’s been 10 years since Operation Span [the GMP investigation] and until now they’d never accepted what really happened. If we’d never found lawyers I don’t know if they ever would have apologised to us.” A key player in the story has been Maggie Oliver who in 2012 resigned from her job as a detective constable and turned whistleblower to protest at what she saw as terrible police failures. She later set up the Maggie Oliver Foundation ,which supports and advocates for survivors of child sexual abuse. Oliver said she felt relieved that finally, “after an all-consuming 10-year battle”, GMP “have at last acknowledged that their horrific treatment of these three victims was wrong, even inhumane”. An apology could not put right the harm the three women had suffered, Oliver said, “but at least now they can begin to look ahead to the rest of their lives knowing they were failed”. The three women launched their claim against GMP in 2019; proceedings against the Crown Prosecution Service are ongoing. Ellis said what they had achieved was extraordinary after all they had been through. Harriet Wistrich, the director of CWJ, said: “The trial 10 years ago was hailed as a victory, but it followed years of abject policing failures.” She said the same failures still existed, pointing to a report published in February that said police and councils were still potentially downplaying the scale of child sexual exploitation by criminal gangs. “We hope this historic victory will provide an additional spur to police forces around the country to implement effective measures to tackle this pernicious crime.”",News/UK news,GMP police chief apologises to Rochdale grooming gang victims ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/12/gmp-police-chief-apologises-rochdale-grooming-gang-victims
4/13/2022,"The World Bank is planning financial support to Ukraine worth $1.5bn (£1.2bn) to help keep critical services running as the country fights a fresh assault by Russia in Vladimir Putin’s ongoing war. The bank said the funds would be used to support the continuation of key government services, including wages for hospital workers, pensions for elderly people, and social programmes for vulnerable people. In addition to $944m of emergency financing already mobilised by the World Bank, the institution said it was preparing the fresh funding to help essential government services continue to function during the war. The $1.5bn investment project financing includes $1bn of support through its International Development Association arm, as well as $472m in funding guaranteed by its International Bank for Reconstruction and Development division. Announcing the funds in a speech in Poland on Tuesday, David Malpass, the president of the World Bank, said the organisation was providing immediate working capital for companies providing critical supplies to Ukraine. “We are working to help Ukrainian refugees as they plan their return home, help host communities as they absorb Ukrainians, and help the many millions of internally displaced persons in Ukraine who have lost their homes and livelihoods,” he said. Founded in 1944 to help Europe rebuild after the second world war, the Washington-based organisation includes Russia and Ukraine as members. Malpass, who met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Munich on 19 February, days before the outbreak of the war, said the bank stood “ready to help Ukraine with reconstruction when the time comes”. The head of the global development body said it was analysing the impacts of the ongoing war, including the rise in food and energy prices expected to have a severe impact for low-income countries around the world. “[We are] preparing a surge crisis response that will provide focused support for developing countries,” he said. The World Trade Organization has downgraded its global trade growth forecasts for the year, saying the prospects for the global economy had darkened since the war started on 24 February. With sweeping sanctions imposed by western allies in response to Putin’s war, the Russian economy is expected to fall into a deep recession. A former Russian finance minister, Alexei Kudrin, said the economy was set for the biggest contraction in economic output since 1994, when the country was struggling to recover from the collapse of the Soviet Union. Kremlin economy and finance ministers are working on new forecasts, the RIA state news agency reported. “The official forecast would be for more than around a 10% contraction,” said Kudrin, who served as Putin’s finance minister from 2000 to 2011, according to the report. The World Bank said last week that Russia’s economy was forecast to contract by 11.2% this year, while Ukraine would suffer a plunge of 45.1% given the magnitude of the humanitarian crisis unleashed by the war. However, the conflict is also leading to global disruption, with a sharp rise in prices for energy, fertiliser and food. Together, Russia and Ukraine account for more than a quarter of global wheat exports, with lower-income countries in the Middle East and north Africa among the biggest buyers. Malpass warned that the war in Ukraine and continuing Covid lockdowns in China were affecting the global economic recovery from the pandemic. Speaking ahead of the spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund next week, he said poorer countries would find it harder to respond to the shocks than wealthier western nations. “The repercussions are worsening the inequality as the war affects commodity and financial markets, trade and migration linkages, and investor and consumer confidence,” he said.",News/World news,World Bank planning to give support worth $1.5bn to Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/world-bank-approves-770m-ukraine-services-funds-russia
4/13/2022,"Doctors and scientists at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) are investigating 74 mystery cases of children hospitalised with hepatitis. Hepatitis is a condition that affects the liver and may occur for a number of reasons. However, in the cases under investigation, the common viruses that cause hepatitis have not been detected, officials said. Public health doctors and scientists are examining 49 cases in England, 13 in Scotland and 12 across Wales and Northern Ireland. All have occurred since January. Several possible causes are being investigated, UKHSA said. One active line of inquiry is whether or not a group of viruses called adenoviruses may be causing the illnesses. Adenoviruses usually cause a range of mild illnesses and most people recover without complications. They can cause a range of symptoms, including colds, vomiting and diarrhoea. While they don’t typically cause hepatitis, it is a known rare complication of the viruses. Other potential explanations are also being investigated, including whether or not Covid-19, other infections or environmental causes may have played a role in the spate of cases. However, officials stressed that there is no link to Covid-19 vaccines because none of the children affected have had a vaccine. Dr Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections at the UKHSA, said: “We are working swiftly with the NHS and public health colleagues in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to investigate a wide range of possible factors which may be causing children to be admitted to hospital with liver inflammation known as hepatitis. “One of the possible causes that we are investigating is that this is linked to adenovirus infection. However, we are thoroughly investigating other potential causes. “Normal hygiene measures such as good handwashing, including supervising children, and respiratory hygiene, help to reduce the spread of many of the infections that we are investigating. We are also calling on parents and guardians, to be alert to the signs of hepatitis, including jaundice, and to contact a healthcare professional if they are concerned.”",News/Society,UK health agency investigating surge in hepatitis cases in children ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/12/uk-health-agency-investigating-surge-in-hepatitis-cases-in-children
4/13/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has accused the Premier League and TV companies of throwing “a stick between the legs” of Liverpool’s quadruple chase with a fixture schedule that he claims no other league in the world would impose. Liverpool are firm favourites to reach the Champions League semi-finals on Wednesday when they take a 3-1 lead into their quarter-final second leg against Benfica at Anfield. Klopp’s team then face Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday followed by home league games against Manchester United and Everton. But it is the early kick-off away at Newcastle on Saturday 30 April, that falls between dates for the first and second legs of the Champions League semi-finals, that has exasperated Klopp. The Liverpool manager believes the workload explains why no English club have won a quadruple before. “We are part of four competitions, and thankfully we are good enough this year not to go out early, but the fixture list we have now, let’s get through it,” Klopp said. “The only game I am concerned about is Benfica. Because of the success we had so far we play Saturday against City, but it could have been Aston Villa [in the Premier League]. Then we play United, then we play Everton. Then, if we get through tomorrow, we have a semi-final and BT and the Premier League thought we should have Newcastle away at 12.30. “The schedule, and how people use the fame in the moment – Liverpool is hot and everyone wants to see them – they couldn’t care less, the TV stations. It’s just not OK. “If we play a Champions League semi-final, find me another league in the world and another broadcaster who would put the one team in the semi-finals – it might be two or three English teams – on at 12.30. It’s like: ‘Throw them a little stick between the legs!’ What? What are you doing? Why would you do that? That’s why it’s so difficult, that’s why it never happens, because nobody cares. “It’s unbelievably difficult. We are still in three competitions and we play City; you saw how difficult that was. How could I sit here now and think about other cups? We play Benfica tomorrow and how can I sit here thinking about winning the Champions League? I don’t. We just try to squeeze everything out to stay as long in the competition as somehow possible and then be there in the final, hopefully, or in the league to make the last decisive step.” The Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson admits the schedule is “crazy” but claims the squad can handle potentially 13 more matches this season in the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup. “At this level we need to be prepared for that and we are,” the Brazil international said. “We have a great fitness staff and we are training every day for that. We have the targets, which is achieving all the finals, playing all the games – as many games as it’s possible for us in the season – so we want to win everything. We are ready for that. “Of course it is not easy, of course we sometimes feel tired, but you need to put in your mind that you have enough energy to deal with every challenge. We want to be in every match. If you play those matches you feel tired and you think: ‘It’s a crazy schedule.’ But we are focused on our goals and now that is Benfica.” Klopp said he would make changes in response to Sunday’s intense 2-2 draw at City, not with their FA Cup semi-final in mind, and expects Benfica to throw everything at Liverpool. “I would go for it, full throttle,” he said of attempting to overturn a 3-1 deficit. “I would try to put us under pressure, score early, and if not try to score a bit later. That’s what we expect. Benfica respected us before, but during the game I am pretty sure they felt that they were close here and there. But now, bad news for Benfica, it’s Anfield. They don’t only play against us, they play against the whole crowd.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp hits out at Liverpool’s crowded fixture schedule,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/12/jurgen-klopp-hits-out-at-liverpools-crowded-fixture-schedule
4/13/2022,"They broke the rules they set for everyone else. Then the prime minister lied and lied again to parliament. “Never before in history has a prime minister broken the law,” Chris Bryant, chair of both the standards and privileges committees, told me this afternoon. “These aren’t just rules; they broke the law.” Johnson’s chancellor, asked if he had attended two Downing Street Christmas parties, told the Commons: “No, Mr Speaker, I did not attend any parties.” Breaking the law and lying about it or misleading the house would have seen any other prime minister and chancellor resign instantly. But nothing can make them go if they cling to their posts. Only their own MPs can oust them, with a flurry of those famous letters to the backbench 1922 committee chair. There should be queues forming outside Sir Graham Brady’s door right now, but don’t hold your breath. Instead, you hear calculating perplexity: without them, who would be our winning leader? But for the sake of their reputations, these MPs should only consider the probity of their party. More sententiously, they pretend concern for the country: a war is no time to ditch a leader. Really? In both world wars, inadequate leaders were dumped unceremoniously for someone better suited for that serious and decisive role. None of them selected Boris Johnson expecting him to make a war leader. God knows how long the war in Ukraine may last, but the time may come, before long, when citizens across Nato countries will be asked to make sacrifices, in energy, in supply lines, in taxes. An immoral lawbreaker who has failed to acknowledge the grievousness of his own behaviour is hardly the man to call on others to tighten their belts in the national interest. This government pretends Covid has gone away, because it wishes it had. It has chosen to ignore the hundreds of deaths a day, the hospitals and ambulance services overwhelmed, pretending it’s all over. But wherever Johnson and Rishi Sunak go, if ever again they dare face an unscripted audience, someone will stand up and say, “My mother died alone, because we obeyed the law” or “My children had to say goodbye to their dying mother on a tablet, because we all obeyed the law while you held 12 parties.” Imagine trying to dodge every ordinary citizen who might have a story to tell during an election campaign. Bryant has a constituent, a university student, who was fined £2,100 for attending – not organising – a party during lockdown. Many others will wonder why these two got off so lightly. To the hundreds of thousands with painful Covid stories, those Downing Street parties will always be an affront, not a mere bagatelle as the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg pretend. And for none of them will all this fade away by the next election. Tory MPs need to hear loud and clear from all their electors. They need a frightening avalanche of emails and letters, today, right now. Nothing else will stir them to do what their party would certainly have done at any other point in its history.

4/13/2022,"Opponents of the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, are demanding answers after the revelation that the country’s armed forces had splashed out on tens of thousands of impotence pills. “We must understand why the Bolsonaro administration is spending public money on buying such large quantities of Viagra,” the lawmaker Elias Vaz declared after Brazilian media reported the seemingly unorthodox acquisitions on Monday. The navy and air force – which between them had reportedly bought more than 30,000 pills – offered an innocent explanation: the drug was supposedly being used to treat pulmonary hypertension. However, many were unconvinced. A report in the O Globo newspaper suggested the dosages that had been bought were generally used to treat penises, not blood pressure. “How do you feel knowing that we’re even paying for Viagra for the armed forces?” the Brazilian singer Zélia Duncan asked her hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers. “I feel impotent,” one replied. Rio congressman Marcelo Freixo said he would ask the public prosecutor to investigate the erectile “outrage”. “The Bolsonaro administration dallied over buying Covid vaccines but approved the overpriced purchase of 35,000 Viagra pills for the armed forces,” Freixo complained on Twitter. The president of the Worker’s party (PT), Gleisi Hoffman, slammed the “criminal spending spree” and accused Bolsonaro of destroying the military’s credibility. Ciro Gomes, a centre-left politician who hopes to challenge Bolsonaro in October’s presidential election, said that while the armed forces deserved respect, their acquisition departments seemed bent on demoralizing the military. “Unless they’re able to prove they’re developing some kind of secret weapon – capable of revolutionizing the international arms industry – it’ll be tough to justify the purchase of 35,000 units of a erectile dysfunction drug,” Gomes opined. He added: “It’s no coincidence that these absurdities are taking place during the government of a president … who acts systematically to dishonor the troop.” Bolsonaro, 67, is a former army captain and paratrooper who has packed his cabinet with military men and repeatedly hinted that he would be prepared to lead a military “intervention” against Brazil’s democratic institutions. Last year Bolsonaro ordered what critics called a “banana republic-style” military parade outside his presidential palace in an apparent attempt to project strength and intimidate foes. Political observers called the military’s “Viagra binge” an embarrassment to a populist president who frequently boasts about his supposed virility, referring to himself as “imbrochável”. The word roughly translates into English as “unfloppable” or “flaccid-proof”.",News/World news,Bolsonaro faces stiff questioning over Brazilian army’s Viagra purchase,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/brazil-armed-forces-viagra-jair-bolsonaro
4/13/2022,"Millions across the world watched cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason play at Megan and Harry’s wedding. But only a tiny fraction of those viewers would have known the haunting Sicilienne with which his performance begun, or the composer believed to have written it. Maria Theresia von Paradis, once the darling of the Viennese court, a blind piano prodigy, singer, composer and music professor who performed for royalty throughout Europe, has since been erased from history. “She was deeply respected by her contemporaries – Mozart, Salieri and Haydn,” says Selina Mills, co-librettist of a new chamber opera about her life, with music by Errollyn Wallen. “They all wrote for her – and they most likely shagged her too.” Blind from the age of five, Paradis studied with Antonio Salieri, who composed an organ concerto for her, and established a successful career as a pianist and singer. She was so proficient at the keyboard that Mozart, by some accounts, wrote his Piano Concerto No 18, K456 for her, and her concerts in London saw her hailed as “the blind enchantress”. When she died in 1824, contemporary catalogues recorded that Paradis had written at least five operas, two cantatas, 15 keyboard works, songs and a piano trio. But, like Sophocles and Aeschylus, she was fated to have much of her oeuvre lost to future generations. Paradis has largely been forgotten as a musician and replaced – if at all – by a sexualised foil to the grand narratives of classical music’s great men. There’s a nasty little scene, for instance, in Peter Shaffer’s Amadeus in which Salieri tries to get his rival into trouble. “Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies,” Salieri tells Emperor Joseph, striving to thwart Mozart’s appointment as teacher to Joseph’s young niece. “One of my own pupils – a very young singer – told me she was, er, well, molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.” The singer in question was Paradis. “What happened to her became a joke in court. Courtiers would say: ‘Mozart is in paradise,’ says Mills. “Geddit?” If Paradis has ever come centre stage it is chiefly through the lens of her unsuccessful treatment by Franz Mesmer, the German physician whose theories of animal magnetism were tested out on the 18-year-old musician. That relationship was the focus of Julian Barnes’s short story Harmony, Hilary Mantel’s radio play The Price of Light, and Barbara Albert’s elegant film Mademoiselle Paradis. The last of these explored the bitter irony that when Mesmer briefly managed to get Paradis to see again, her musical talent seemed to deteriorate – opening up the the possibility that her artistry was dependent on sensory deprivation and raising the intriguing question of whether she would actually have been better off if she had regained her sight permanently. “People were always trying to fix her,” says playwright and co-librettist Nicola Werenowska. “For me, as a neuro-divergent person, that resonates profoundly. People were always trying to cure me of dyspraxia by coming up with ways to get me to tie my own shoelaces or improve my handwriting.” “The same happens to me,” says Mills, who is partially sighted. “I’m always having people say, ‘Can’t you get laser treatment, or an app?’” We’re chatting in a back room of Graeae, the theatre company named after three sisters of Greek mythology who had one eye and one tooth between them which they shared. Director Jenny Sealey has been deaf since she was seven. How, you may be wondering, does a deaf woman direct an opera? “It is not a world I know,” she admits, “but when I get scared it fuels my desire not to conform. Everything we do at Graeae is experimental and challenging.” Sealey has long pioneered a new theatrical language, creatively embedding signing, creative captioning and audio description into rehearsals and on stage. At rehearsal Sealey puts her cast through their paces, accompanied by a signer and composer Errollyn Wallen. Wallen’s score mixes jazz and other improbable musics with pastiches evoking the first Vienna school, as well as quotations from Mozart and Salieri. She was concerned to give the opera’s characters their own musical signatures: “It’s not just a question of characters having their own motifs but they often have their own key centres and rhythms.” The Paradis Files does not soft pedal the suffering its heroine endured at the hands of quacks and charlatans hired by her parents. Enter, at one point in the opera, Josef Barth, a specialist in using bleeding techniques to cure cataracts. “Let me examine your eyes with pins,” he sings. “Just a little discomfort.” Jan Ingherhaus, a pioneer in electricity, wants to apply charged pincers to Theresia’s eyes. And then there is the so-called master of bandages who wants to bandage her head so tightly that the optic nerve will function better. “Please stop it! howls Theresia, sung by mezzo-soprano Bethan Langford, herself visually impaired. “Get away from me!” Despite all this torture, The Paradis Files is decidedly not a tragedy, still less the depiction of a passive woman on the receiving end of patriarchal power. That approach probably stems from the fact that most of the creatives involved in the production are disabled women. “We all vehemently agreed that this would not be the core of our story,” says Sealey. “She really did not see her life as a tragedy,” says Mills, who points out that not only was Paradis a successful musician and businesswoman – after her performing career was over she set up the first school in Vienna for blind girls – but also an inventor. She devised different-shaped playing cards for blind people so she could join in at the card tables at court and designed raised maps made of pâpier-maché and a system of silken cords with different knots that she draped across her lap so she could so she could recall key and time changes while playing. When Paradis died, explains Mills, she left enough money in the bank to support her school for a century afterward, and, unlike Mozart, who was buried in a pauper’s grave, she was laid to rest in the family mausoleum in Vienna. “We were really committed to giving Theresia her voice after she had been silenced for so long,” says Mills. That said, much of the opera’s story is fiction. “I wanted to write about class so I invented the character of Gerda, Theresia’s maid ,” says Werenowska. There is also a Greek chorus of gossips who keep up a running commentary on the story as it flashes back through her life. Mills, who spent many years researching her book Life Unseen: The History of Blindness, says she was long looking for a blind female role model: “It was wonderful for me to find Maria Theresia von Paradis. She is the woman I’d been searching for.”  The Paradis Files, performed by Graeae and the BBC Concert Orchestra, is at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, on 13 and 14 April, then touring until 12 May.",Arts/Music,‘People were always trying to fix her’: the ‘blind enchantress’ who wowed Mozart,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/12/maria-theresia-von-paradis-blind-opera-star-errollyn-wallen-graeae
4/13/2022,"Trevor Noah returned to the Daily Show studio – and a live audience – for the first time in more than two years on Monday. A week after his Grammys hosting gig, the host touched on another awards show controversy: the Slap, which led the Academy to ban Will Smith from all its events, including the Oscars, for 10 years. “You realize by then, I Am Legend is just going to be real life,” Noah quipped. Is Will Smith’s 10-year Oscars ban a punishment or a favor? pic.twitter.com/l2a1dk2W1n “When I first read the headline, I thought this was the worst punishment ever,” he continued. “I was like, ‘10 years? The Oscars? This is ridiculous.’ But I got into the details, and I realize he gets to keep his Oscar, and he can still win Oscars even though he’s banned. So in many ways, this isn’t a punishment. This is a favor. “Will Smith doesn’t have to go to the ceremony,” he said. “He doesn’t have to dress up, he doesn’t have to sit through a bunch of boring awards that he doesn’t care about. He doesn’t have to pretend to be happy when he loses – I wish I could get banned from the Emmys! Every year I have to go and act like I might beat John Oliver. It’s a nightmare!” “I also think they should have at least consulted Chris Rock before choosing the punishment, you know?” Noah added. “Because if Will were still going to the Oscars, that’s at least four hours where Chris Rock knows where he is. Now, he could be anywhere.” In all honesty, though, “I don’t think they should’ve banned Will Smith at all,” Noah concluded. “I think they should’ve hired Will Smith to replace the wrap-it-up music at awards shows. Do you know how quickly winners will finish their speeches when they see Will Smith watching them from the side of the stage?” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert discussed reports that Russian soldiers stole dangerously radioactive items from Chernobyl to keep as souvenirs. “Well of course you can’t go to Chernobyl and not check out the gift shop,” he said, mocking a radioactive tourist: “Oh look hon, they have a T-shirt that says, ‘I had a nuclear blast at Chernobyl!’” As sanctions for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine finally begin to land, Russia defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time since February 1918. “Now, I’m sure you’re saying, ‘Steve, how bad is this for Russia’s cashflow? Is this like they lost their wallet? Or they invested all their money in Morbius?’” Colbert mused. “Basically, it’s pretty darn bad,” he said. Russia tried to pay rubles on a loan taken out in dollars, but was unable to since sanctions bar Russia from accessing its reserves in American banks. “None of the American banks are available to them!” Colbert exclaimed. “No banks, no Elizabeth Banks, no Tyra Banks, no Joseph A Banks! No two suits for the price of one.” In other news, Donald Trump endorsed controversial TV host Dr Oz for the US Senate in Pennsylvania. “Come on, he’s a conman! And so is Dr Oz,” Colbert deadpanned. In a statement, Trump said Oz had “lived with us through the screen and has always been popular, respected, and smart.” “Aww, grandpa thinks his TV friends are his real friends,” Colbert joked. And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel mocked concern by the House committee investigating January 6 that if attorney general Merrick Garland decides to prosecute, Republicans will smear the effort as a partisan witch-hunt. “Pretty sure that Titanic has sailed already,” Kimmel mused. “Any time any of them get accused of anything it’s a witch-hunt.” “So why not refer it to the justice department?” he continued. “If you’re worried about the optics of prosecuting, why do the investigation in the first place?” “How does this guy keep getting away with this stuff?” he wondered. “He’s the presidential equivalent of the Tinder Swindler. They could at least ban him from the Oscars for 10 years, right?” Kimmel also provided an update on the feud between him and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who tore into Kimmel on a podcast with disgraced Republican colleague Matt Gaetz over the weekend. Gaetz called Kimmel a “total jerk” whose “trend is to attack women”. “Says the guy who’s currently under federal investigation for sex trafficking, obstructing justice, and paying for sex with a 17-year-old girl,” Kimmel retorted. “That’s not fair at all,” he added. “I make jokes about men too.

4/13/2022,"You don’t need to have raised children to know that, at its core, parenthood is about unconditional love. We don’t get to choose them, and we may find friends and companions that we gel with better, but family is supposed to be that ultimate safety net. If your life is upended and all else seems lost, it should be a reserve of love that will never be depleted. Of course, parenthood also means disapproval, disappointment, even blind fury – but, for most, being rejected or abandoned by those who brought you into the world is unthinkable. For many LGBTQ+ people, however, it can be a grim fact of life. It has been more than half a century since same-sex acts were partly decriminalised, and 25 years since a Labour government was elected that commendably repealed anti-gay laws. But according to a new study by the charity Galop, a third of LGBTQ+ people have suffered abuse from relatives, mostly their parents. Among trans and non-binary people, that figure is even higher: more than four in 10. Statistics rarely convey the horror of what they account for, so consider just this one example. One young trans woman I spoke to couldn’t remember how old she was when she was first hit by her father, but she clearly remembers, aged 16, him drunkenly “smashing [her] against the kitchen cabinet”, then holding her by her throat “about a foot off the ground”. The provocation? She had kissed her then-boyfriend at a party in her parents’ home. Years of abuse took her to the edge. Being around men who reminded her of her father – whether it was because they smelled of his aftershave, were also bald, or were customers who yelled at her at work – would lead to the trauma resurfacing. Her wider family didn’t stand by her; contact with them has evaporated. “It sucks not to have blood relations who are sound,” she said, “but it is what it is.” It is common for young LGBTQ+ people to know, even in a vague sense, that they are different at an early age, and to panic at the possible implications. Adolescence is when the pressure to conform and “fit in” often feels most acute. For young queer folk, this can mean sleep-deprived nights full of cold sweats and panicked imaginings of how loved ones may react when they’re decloseted. These days, for most, what follows is affirmation: hugs, pledges to love them no matter what, that their happiness is all that matters. But it wasn’t so for the young gay woman who recalls her bigoted grandmother moving in when she was 16, using a homophobic slur and triggering a huge row. Her mother told her daughter that she couldn’t live with them if she was going to antagonise her grandmother “by being gay”, and demanded she pack her things and leave. Although she found refuge with her supportive father, she told me, her mental health inevitably suffered. Parents know what is best for their child, goes a well-worn cliche, but in too many cases this is demonstrably untrue. Pre-pandemic polling by Galop showed that one in five Britons still think being LGBTQ+ is immoral, and one in 10 thought LGBTQ+ people were a danger to others. That’s a minority, sure, but it’s still millions of people. Some parents may rationalise their failure to affirm in loving terms – believing that being lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans will lead to an unhappy life, without realising that such unhappiness is often caused by attitudes such as theirs. By depriving their offspring of unconditional love at a young age, they risk inflicting lifelong damage on their children, planting a bomb within them that may not detonate for years. According to Galop’s research, 92% of the LGBTQ+ people who had suffered negative experiences at a formative age had suffered lasting repercussions. “This isn’t a stranger in the street, this is your home, your safe place, the people closest to you who you trust the most,” says Galop’s Abigail Herbert, “so it feels as if there’s no one you can talk to when you’ve had that trust broken.” All research shows that mental health struggles are disproportionately higher among LGBTQ+ people; this, in turn, leads to higher levels of alcohol and drug abuse, all too often a form of self-medication. Almost all LGBTQ+ people have friends who need special support because they were robbed of the love that should have been taken as read. So when a young gay man tells me of his violent father calling him a “gay bastard”, or when a non-binary person tells me about how their family cut them off, I see parents placing their right to baseless bigotry ahead of their child’s wellbeing. As the great British anti-trans moral panic escalates ever further – framing the most marginalised minority of the LGBTQ+ rainbow as would-be sexual predators and threats to children – more of those ticking bombs are being set among a new generation. When encountering those for whom a fear of trans rights has become a life-consuming passion, it is difficult not to worry about what their reaction to their children might be if one of them revealed a trans identity. One trans woman told me of being beaten by their mother when they came out aged six; of since being misgendered and assaulted by their father; of having brothers pull out hair extensions and punching their chest; of being trapped for so long on endless NHS waiting lists for trans services that a family member told them to “stop this transgender madness”. It doesn’t even have to be abuse – with so few willing to push back on anti-trans talking points in the British media, many parents may simply be left baffled and lacking the emotional tools to support their children. As Galop underlines, with trans women too often unwelcome in women’s refuges, and a lack of specialist LGBTQ+ provision, many trans people are forced into potentially dangerous emergency accommodation, into homelessness, or to remain with their abusive relatives. For years, rescinded anti-gay laws and drastically improved public attitudes led to growing confidence among LGBTQ+ people. This may prove to have been complacent: homophobic and transphobic hate crimes are surging, and the ricocheting effect of anti-trans rhetoric creates an increasingly toxic environment for LGBTQ+ people in general. Stonewall, the main LGBTQ+ civil rights organisation, is under siege, and the Council of Europe has placed Britain in the same category for backsliding on LGBTQ+ rights as Hungary, Poland, Russia and Turkey. Such an atmosphere will embolden, rather than educate, those afflicted with anti-LGBTQ+ bigotries; some will have children who may internalise their parent’s sense of rejection. This should be considered a form of child abuse. No one should doubt the challenges of parenthood, that mistakes are made, that perfection is unattainable. But offering unconditional love costs nothing; depriving a child of it can cost everything.

4/13/2022,"Chelsea have had some great teams throughout the years, ever since the club was founded in 2003. But weirdly, neither of their two sides that landed Big Cup were, comparatively speaking, a particularly great vintage. The Fiver still has no idea how that first Mourinho team didn’t win the competition at least twice, for example, and it’s too simplistic to just blame Rafa Benítez and John Terry. Anyway, that’s not really the point, which is, they’re not that brilliant now either – Brentford, innit – and so The Fiver had assumed No 3 was a slam-dunk into the bag this year. But right now things aren’t looking so good. Huh? What gives? Real Madrid is what gives. Madrid are the kings of Big Cup, with a lineage stretching from the days of Ferenc Puskás and Alfredo Di Stéfano to modern heroes such as cellular communication enthusiast Cristiano Ronaldo and Scottie Scheffler wannabe Gareth Bale. They’re past masters at getting the job done, and their route to yet another semi-final appearance looks rather-more-than-semi-assured after last week’s saunter up and down the King’s Rahd. Madrid have a 94.44% success rate when winning the first leg away in Europe, you see, while Chelsea’s win percentage after losing the opening skirmish at home is a whopping zero. Disappointment appears a statistical shoo-in, then, not that any of us needed a calculator to be aware that misery is inevitably coming down the track in one shape or another anyway. But there is hope! While Los Merengues have only lost two of the 36 ties in which they’ve first secured an away win, they did make an awful sticky, crumbly, eggy mess of the bed just three years ago, when Ajax rocked up at the Bernabéu and put four past them to end their three-year run as Big Cup champions. Ajax’s first goal that evening was scored by a certain Hakim Ziyech, who will surely have spent most of the run-up to this match telling his Chelsea teammates that many of the Madrid side embarrassed in 2019 are still there, and can be got at. The only question being: is this Chelsea vintage good enough to take advantage? Their fans must hope so … but even if they’re not, history proves that being bang average usually turns out fine for them as well.

4/13/2022,"Human rights groups are calling for the urgent release of detainees in Ukrainian immigration centres, after allegations that conditions have dangerously deteriorated since the Russian invasion in February. At least 45 people are thought to remain in the EU-funded Zhuravychi migrant accommodation centre, a former army barracks situated in a pine forest in the Volyn province, according to the international NGO Human Rights Watch (HRW). Nadia Hardman, a researcher in the refugee and migrant rights division at HRW, who interviewed several men detained at Zhuravychi over the phone, said they were “locked up in a war zone” and were “justifiably terrified”. “They could see sometimes, from the TV, where the war was, but obviously, they don’t have an updated idea. And then there’s the sounds of war that they could hear, and they have no idea how far away that is or what that means,” she added. The centre is one hour from Lutsk and two hours from the border with Belarus. An airfield in Lutsk was hit by a Russian airstrike on 11 March, which killed two soldiers and injured six others, according to Yurii Pohuliaiko, head of the Volyn regional state administration. All of those detained in the centre were traumatised, said Hardman, some having escaped war in their own countries. When HRW conducted the interviews there were more than 100 men being held from up to 15 different countries, including Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Bangladesh. The Guardian spoke to a former detainee, Mohammed*, who was released from the centre on 18 March. “It’s horrible – it’s not for immigrants, it’s for prisoners. It kills your mind; you only sit, eat, sleep. You can’t think well. I struggled to sleep – you just stay awake,” he said over the phone. The situation got worse once the war started, and conditions inside the centre began to deteriorate, according to Mohammed. “We were scared for our lives,” said the 26-year-old, who did not wish to disclose his nationality. “All of us immigrants, we got together and we asked the guards to call their boss and someone came down and we said, ‘Civilians are evacuating from Ukraine, we should be allowed to leave too. Just release us.’ They told us no. They took our phones, but we managed to hide one and they beat us. They were laughing at us.” A video filmed by one of the detainees and seen by the Guardian shows a man lying on the ground, allegedly after being beaten by a guard. Mohammed says he heard explosions while he was detained and that there was nowhere to hide as the centre does not have a bomb shelter. “When the war started, the military came and took over one of the two buildings [in the centre]. The immigrants that were living there had to relocate to another building. We saw a lot of tanks, a lot of military equipment, a lot of troops. We were so scared. It was 10 metres from us,” he said. Michael Flynn, director of the Global Detention Project (GDP), said: “There is no justification for keeping migrants and refugees in administrative detention in situations of active warfare.” He added that international law clearly indicates the necessity of releasing detainees from these centres. “The laws of war, the Geneva conventions, require all sides in a conflict to take necessary precautions to shield all civilians under their control from the dangers of the conflict.” HRW said it is gravely concerned for the safety of those still detained and believes they are at serious risk. Hardman said they are calling on Ukraine and the EU to release those detained and for neighbouring countries, such as Poland, to allow all foreign nationals fleeing Ukraine to enter and claim asylum. A volunteer from the Global Society of Tigray Scholars and Professionals (GSTS), who was in touch with a group of male detainees in March, said that along with about 100 men, there were 30 women being held separately, some with children, the youngest of whom was four. The men told her that when the war started they were given dirty water which caused people to become ill and food was limited. Most of the detainees lived off a piece of bread a day, she said. Mohammed had been studying in Ukraine when he was caught by the immigration authorities for trying to work – which is not allowed – and threatened with deportation. “At that time, my country was in war – it still is – I couldn’t go back so I decided to cross the border into Romania.” But he was caught by Romanian border guards and taken back to Ukraine. He was sentenced by a court to six months’ detention and sent to Zhuravychi on 2 November 2021. He was released only after his embassy intervened. Other embassies have also helped in the release of some detainees, including those from Bangladesh and India. Mohammed said he is “100% sure” that there are people still being detained. “Some of the people tried to contact their embassy using our phone, but now we are gone. They need help. I don’t know why they keep them there. If they release us without going to court, why not them?” He added that the guards said they would give the detainees Ukrainian passports “right now” if they agreed to fight the Russians. “It wasn’t a joke, they were serious. We said no, we’re refugees.” The Guardian has approached the Zhuravychi detention facility and the Ukrainian authorities for comment. The volunteer from GSTS said some of those that were released from the centre in the first few days of the war are now being held in a detention centre in Poland, after they were arrested attempting to cross the Polish border, but these claims could not be verified. There are two other immigration detention centres in Ukraine – one in Chernihiv, until recently under siege, where GDP believes people have been released. The other is Mykolayiv PTPI (or Nikolaev Temporary Stay) in Voznesensky district in the south, near Odesa. GDP were able to confirm that it remained in operation with detainees as of two weeks ago. * Name has been changed",News/Global development,‘Scared for our lives’: grave concerns over safety of refugees detained by Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/12/ukraine-refugees-detained-russia-war
4/13/2022,"One of the Premiership’s leading coaches believes the introduction of a 20-minute red card could help reduce the growing unease about the fairness of rugby’s disciplinary sanctions. World Rugby are understood to be considering the idea of a global trial and the Bristol director of rugby, Pat Lam, is among those who would back the proposal. Following a crackdown on upright tackles and head contact, there have been an increasing number of controversial red cards this season, not least Charlie Ewels’ second-minute dismissal for England against Ireland at Twickenham last month. Under an experimental law being trialled in Super Rugby, a sent-off player can be tactically replaced by a substitute after 20 minutes, thus restoring their side to full strength. The counter argument is that diluting the sting of a red card reduces an offender’s incentive to improve their tackle technique, instantly undermining the game’s push for greater player safety. Lam, however, says there are now so many red cards being shown that sides are being punished unfairly. “Red cards used to be for out and out foul play … someone punching someone or a real dangerous situation,” said Lam, whose Bristol side face Sale at Ashton Gate on Friday in the second leg of their Heineken Champions Cup last-16 tie. “But with the current laws around tackle height we’re seeing a lot of stuff. The rule is probably a good idea with the amount of red cards out there. Pretty much every week someone is getting a red card.” Lam, though, feels the lack of consistency surrounding some refereeing decisions is “the bigger issue” in the sport. Last weekend Leinster’s Jamison Gibson-Park received only a yellow card for a dangerous upright tackle on Connacht’s Kieran Marmion while Leicester’s Guy Porter was sent off in Clermont following an accidental off-the-ball collision. World Rugby has yet to make a firm decision on the 20-minute red card proposal with the Super Rugby-based evidence regarded as inconclusive. Sources within the organisation, however, acknowledge there has been disquiet at some recent refereeing interpretations which may yet lead to a tweaking of the framework surrounding incidences of head contact. Lam, meanwhile, also believes next year’s European Cup should revert to its traditional pool structure. “I’m still a big fan of the original. I think everyone I’ve talked to liked the original format. You know who you’re playing and it’s the way to go. If we’re out of Covid, going back to the other format is probably the best way.”",Sport/Sport,Bristol’s Pat Lam in favour of rugby introducing 20-minute red cards,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/12/bristols-pat-lam-in-favour-of-rugby-introducing-20-minute-red-cards
4/13/2022,"Diego Simeone says that Atlético Madrid’s approach to the Champions League quarter-final second leg will not differ much from the first despite his team needing to beat Manchester City to progress. The coach also insisted that he would not be drawn into an argument about style amid intense criticism of his defensive set-up at the Etihad. After the first leg, which City won 1-0, Pep Guardiola said since “prehistory” it had been difficult to break down a team that play as deep as Atlético had, employing two lines of five. Some in Spain interpreted those words as dig at Atlético, and there has been renewed debate sparked by Simeone tactics. The Argentinian, though, said that he would not respond and appeared to call for respect for his approach, citing advice from his father, Carlos, who died recently: “It’s the mouth that kills the fish.” “I have been coaching since 2005 and I always say the same thing: I never do [comment], I am never disrespectful with colleagues of mine,” Simeone said. “I put myself in the position of the coaches I compete against and I understand that there are different ways of expressing what you feel as a coach.” He then drew on a phrase inspired by fishing which notes that if a fish keeps its mouth shut, it does not get caught on the angler’s hook. “When someone does not appreciate a colleague, I don’t share that. Others’ opinions: press, ex-players, people who haven’t been in the game a long time have opinions and talk … I’ll say what my dad always said: por la boca muere el pez. Words are free and we can all express an opinion. There are ways of acting among colleagues and I have one: respect others always, always, always.” Simeone said he had watched Manchester City against Liverpool, a “fantastic” game between two “teams who play very nice football”, and he highlighted the way that both sides had at times to “take refuge” and adopt “very clear defensive position” because of the quality of their opponents. He said he did not expect City to play differently in the second leg and admitted that nor would Atlético. “I am not going to get far away from what we believe in,” he said. “[But] hopefully we can combine better, have better, faster transitions, be more precise our counterattacks, that our most significant players can have a fantastic night. We will try to take the game to where we think we can hurt them. In a football match, anything can happen.”",Sport/Football,‘The mouth kills the fish’: Simeone refuses to bite on criticism of tactics,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/12/diego-simeone-criticism-tactics-atletico-madrid-manchester-city-mouth-kills-the-fish
4/13/2022,"Drug overdose deaths among high school-aged US teens have more than doubled since 2019, driven by a rise in the deadly opioid fentanyl, a new study has found. Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, who analyzed mortality rates among 14- to 18-year-olds over the past decade, found that while drug use among this age group is actually falling, fatalities are on the rise, jumping from 492 in 2019 to 954 in 2020, then climbing to 1,146 in 2021. Researchers attribute this to a flood of counterfeit pills, which look exactly like real oxycodone or Xanax tablets, but actually contain fentanyl, a synthetic opioid so potent that one counterfeit pill can prove fatal. Vast quantities of these fake pills are being smuggled into the country and are circulating in the illicit drug market, meaning that teens often ingest the deadly drug unknowingly. “We’re seeing really young kids start to die, because the illicit drug supply has become extremely toxic,” said Joseph Friedman, who led the study, published on 12 April in Jama. The study found that the rates of drug deaths are highest among Indigenous and Hispanic teens, but that young people of all races are affected. “It’s scary stuff,” said Friedman, who said even though reported drug use among teens was at all-time lows, the deaths represented the major first overdose spike seen in adolescents since tracking began. “Teens are continuing to experiment with pills; the pills are just getting much more deadly.” A recent study by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that more than 2m fentanyl-filled fake pills were seized by law enforcement agencies in the last quarter of 2021 alone – an indication of how common they have become in the nation’s illicit drug supply. The UCLA study cited survey data showing that the number of 10th graders reporting having used drugs in the past year held steady at about 30% between 2010 and 2020 and then dropped to only 18% during 2021, as the pandemic stretched on. “A really important fact here is that more kids are not doing drugs,” said Morgan Godvin, a Portland, Oregon-based drug addiction researcher and co-author of the study. “The drugs they are doing are just incredibly more lethal.” The study comes at a time when the number of overdose deaths in the US has exploded to more than 100,000 a year due to the huge amounts of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids saturating the country’s drug supply. Fentanyl is as much as 100 times more potent than morphine. “These counterfeit pills are spreading across the nation,” said Friedman, “and teens may not realize they are dangerous.” While many adult users may know the pills they are buying on street markets actually contain fentanyl, youth most likely believe they are getting genuine pharmaceuticals, the researchers said. “Kids think that pills are very safe,” said Godvin. “Because, while they may not might not have been prescribed to them, they were supposedly prescribed to someone. And [young people] believe the purity does not vary.” In reality, though, the opioid dosages in counterfeit pills can vary dramatically. The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that four in 10 seized pills contain potentially lethal doses. The authors called for more drug education in schools, giving kids realistic information about how to protect themselves from fentanyl. “High school might be too late,” said Friedman. “We need to include information about drugs on the street in school even earlier.” The researchers said youth should also be given education about and access to Narcan, the overdose reversal drug, which can revive someone who has overdosed, and fentanyl test strips, which can detect counterfeit pills. Researchers and youth advocacy groups say teens are often easily able to obtain the pills from friends or from local dealers, who offer them on social media apps like Snapchat or Instagram and sometimes deliver them straight to teenagers’ homes. Guardian interviews with families that lost teenagers to accidental overdoses from fentanyl pills show that it can happen to anyone. In February 2021, Sammy Berman Chapman, a 16-year-old straight-A student and the son of the television therapist Laura Berman, died in his bedroom in Los Angeles after taking what he thought was a single Xanax. In Arizona in 2020, Zach Plunk, a 17-year-old star high school running back, died after taking one tablet, labelled to look just like a pharmaceutical “M30” oxycodone pill. In both cases, the tablets, bought over social media, turned out to be deadly doses of fentanyl. Snapchat recently announced increased measures to combat drug dealing on the platform, while Instagram has said the company works to remove such content. “It’s just so sickening,” said Plunk’s mother, Wendy Plunk, who says there is still not enough being done to stop kids from getting the fake pills over social media sites and to warn them about the danger. “We need to get the word out.”",News/US news,Overdose deaths among US teens have more than doubled in three years,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/12/drug-overdose-deaths-us-high-school-teens-study
4/13/2022,"At first glance, the UK jobs market is in rude health. The unemployment rate is back to where it was before the Covid pandemic arrived two years ago and job vacancies are at a record high. But just as X-rays can pick up health problems not detectable to the naked eye, so a closer inspection of the labour market shows up some hidden damage. The Covid crisis has not led to the sharp increase in joblessness that was feared, but it has still left scars. The number of employees is more than half a million lower than it was in early 2020, primarily due to people over 50 no longer working. According to the Learning and Work Institute thinktank there would be 1.25 million more people in the labour market had pre-pandemic trends continued. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says there is no one reason for the rise in inactivity. Some have decided to stop working due to ill health, officials believe, while the events of the past two years have convinced others that the time is right to call it a day. Whatever the reason, demand for workers currently exceeds supply, which is why the number of vacancies is so high. Unsurprisingly, employers are responding to the dearth of workers in a variety of ways. They are offering part-time staff longer hours, they are offering sign-on bonuses to new recruits and they being forced to raise pay rates. The ONS thinks it is possible some of the inactive older workers may be tempted back into the labour market as the cost of living crisis bites harder over the coming months. For public sector workers, falling real pay is already an issue. While bonus payments mean the earnings of people in the finance and business sector have risen by an average of 9.8% over the year to February – well above the 6.2% rise in prices over the same period – public sector pay rose by just 1.9%. Inflation is expected to rise above 8% in April, intensifying the squeeze on public sector workers. Unions representing teachers, nurses, civil servants and local government workers are not going to be especially receptive to calls for wage restraint from Rishi Sunak, especially in light of the chancellor’s recent political and personal difficulties. In the next few months there will be either an exodus of public sector workers to fill the job vacancies in the private sector or industrial action for higher pay. Probably both. Sri Lanka’s first debt default since independence is an example of the long economic shadow cast by the war in Ukraine. Far from being a one-off, it highlights the risk of a broader debt crisis. The decision by the government in Colombo is hardly a shock. For months, Sri Lanka has been hoping something will turn up, but any boost to revenues from the resumption of tourism has been outweighed by the Omicron variant of Covid and the rising cost of fuel and food. The country could either use its dwindling stock of foreign currency reserves to pay its creditors or buy essential imports. The negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to begin soon will doubtless result in the customary package of higher interest rates and cuts in public spending. There is no immediate prospect of life for ordinary Sri Lankans getting any better, but the prospect of an IMF deal will put pressure on creditors to accept a debt restructuring. Sri Lanka is not alone in finding the going tough. Speaking in Warsaw, the World Bank president, David Malpass, said 60% of low-income countries were already in debt distress or at high risk of it. Sri Lanka is not classified by the World Bank as a low-income country. Nor is Ukraine, which is trying to meet more than $7bn of debt payments this year while simultaneously fighting a ruinously expensive war. Malpass has announced an extra $1bn (£770m) package of aid for Ukraine and without question the money will be welcomed by Kyiv. Even more welcome would be action by finance ministers at next week’s spring meetings of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington on an effective global debt restructuring mechanism that would deliver meaningful relief for countries in dire need.",News/Business,Closer inspection of UK jobs market reveals economic scars of Covid | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/12/uk-jobs-market-pandemic-covid-unemployment-public-sector-workers
4/13/2022,"Extinction Rebellion protesters have forced the closure of the insurance market Lloyd’s of London, after using superglue, chains and bicycle locks to block entrances to the building. The environmental activist group said more than 60 people had been at the site in the City of London since 7am on Tuesday to prevent workers from entering and with the intention of closing the business for the day. Extinction Rebellion (XR), which encourages supporters to cause disruption through non-violent civil disobedience, said it was demanding that Lloyd’s stops insuring fossil fuel projects. Some of the protesters wore rat masks, while others were dressed as cleaners, with floral tabards emblazoned with the slogan: “Tell the truth”. Several activists scaled the building’s distinctive curved metal and glass facade, and unfurled a banner that read: “End fossil fuels now”. Lloyd’s, the world’s biggest insurance market, said it had asked employees and other people not to come to the building on Tuesday. It said the market remained open and trading was taking place online. A Lloyd’s spokesperson said: “Lloyd’s supports safe and constructive engagement on climate change and we’re continuing to work to support a responsible transition.” The City of London police said there had not been any arrests by early afternoon and officers were working to “facilitate peaceful protest”.

4/13/2022,"Prices in the US climbed at their highest rates since 1981, rising 8.5% over the year to the end of March as the war in Ukraine drove up energy costs for Americans, the labor department announced on Tuesday. The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) – which measures the prices of a basket of goods and services – comes after the index rose by 7.9% in the year through February, the fastest pace of annual inflation in 40 years. Driven up by continuing supply chain problems, soaring demand and rising energy prices, inflation is now at levels unseen in the US since Ronald Reagan took the White House from Jimmy Carter. The price increases are broad – with the cost of rent, gas and food causing particular hardship for lower income Americans and represent a major blow to the Biden administration, already facing tough odds of retaining control of Congress in November’s midterm elections. Soaring gas prices were the main driver of the rise. The gasoline index rose 18.3% in March and accounted for over half of all the items’ monthly increase. Gas prices have begun to fall, in a sign that some economists have argued may suggest inflation has reached its peak. The food index rose 1% in March compared with February, and is up 8.8% compared with the prior 12 months. Canned fruit and vegetable prices rose 3.8% from February to March, rice prices rose 3.2%, potatoes 3.2% and ground beef 2.1%. Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said energy prices would come down in the months ahead and there were signs that price pressures appear to be moderating. But, he added, the figures were likely to strengthen the Federal Reserve’s plan to increase interest rates as it struggles to tamp down inflation. “With Fed officials sounding more hawkish by the day, the March data won’t change their plans to up the pace of rate-hikes to 50 basis points per meeting from next month. Even so, it does support our view that, having been slow to realize that the initial surge wasn’t transitory, Fed officials are now being a bit too pessimistic about how quickly inflation will drop back,” he wrote in a note to investors. The White House warned ahead of the report it was expecting a bad set of figures. On Monday White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the labor department’s previous report had not included the majority of the jump in oil and gas costs caused by the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. “We expect March CPI headline inflation to be extraordinarily elevated due to Putin’s price hike,” Psaki said. There are two versions of the CPI, one that includes all the prices consumers face and another – core CPI – which excludes food and energy prices, which tend to be more volatile. Core prices climbed 6.5% in the year through March, up from 6.4% in the year through February. The core index did suggest the pace of inflation was slowing, rising 0.3% from February, compared with 0.5% the prior month. Psaki said the administration expected a wide disparity between the two measures because of the soaring price of gas. Nationally the average price of a gallon of gas is now $4.11, compared with $2.86 a year ago, according to AAA. “At times, gas prices were more than one dollar above pre-invasion levels, so that roughly 25% increase in gas prices will drive tomorrow’s inflation reading,” Psaki said. Joe Biden will address the latest inflation figures at a speech in Des Moines, Iowa, later today at which he will announce plans to use more ethanol in US fuel in an attempt to tackle the nation’s gas crisis.",News/Business,"US inflation climbed to 8.5% in March, highest rate since 1981",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/12/us-inflation-rate-march-2022
4/13/2022,"Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore has been edited for release in China to ensure any gay references have been removed. The fantasy sequel, which has an estimated budget of $200m, contains allusions to a romantic history between the characters of Dumbledore and Grindelwald, played by Jude Law and Mads Mikkelsen respectively. Six seconds of dialogue, including the lines “Because I was in love with you” and “The summer Gellert and I fell in love”, were taken out for the Chinese release on 8 April. “As a studio, we’re committed to safeguarding the integrity of every film we release, and that extends to circumstances that necessitate making nuanced cuts in order to respond sensitively to a variety of in-market factors,” studio Warner Bros said in a statement. “Our hope is to release our features worldwide as released by their creators but historically we have faced small edits made in local markets.” The studio insists that despite the cuts, “the spirit of the film remains intact”. While dialogue has been removed, there are still references to the pair sharing a close bond. Only 37 foreign films are released in China every year. While the film opened at the top of the box office in China last weekend, globally the opening was seen as a disappointment with just $58m from 22 markets, lower than its two predecessors. The news follows a string of similar cuts both for the big and small screen in China. In February, there was backlash when the re-release of sitcom Friends was stripped of its lesbian storyline, while the Sex and the City spinoff And Just Like That also aired with all gay references taken out. In 2019, Bohemian Rhapsody was released with any mention of Freddie Mercury’s sexuality removed and in star Rami Malek’s Oscar acceptance speech, the subtitles on Chinese television changed “gay man” to “special group”. While homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997 and removed from an official list of mental disorders in 2001, life under the rule of Xi Jinping has been more conservative and restrictive for many LGBTQ people.

4/13/2022,"An initial report circulating on Monday night from Ukraine said Russian forces had used “a poisonous substance of unknown origin” against Ukrainian civilians and military holed up in the besieged city of Mariupol. The victims were described as having “respiratory failure” and a rather specific diagnosis of “vestibulo-atactic syndrome”, nominally inner ear problems leading to dizziness and perhaps vomiting, eye twitching and loss of balance. There was immediate speculation that the events described were a chemical weapons attack. Liz Truss, the British foreign secretary, said the UK was urgently investigating while a Pentagon spokesperson said the reports “if true, are deeply concerning”. But some observers have expressed scepticism that the available evidence points towards a chemical weapons attack. A video from the Azov battalion, a Ukrainian nationalist group linked to the far right, was released on Tuesday on Telegram and provided a fuller account. It describes events and films some of the victims, who do not appear seriously harmed. The first, a middle-aged man, describes seeing “a white smoke” coming from the factory, most likely the vast Azovstal steel plant in the east of the city and one of two locations where Ukrainian forces are holding out. The smoke or fog, he said later, had “a sweet taste”. The man said he “at once got sick” and that he had suffered from tinnitus, tachycardia (a fast heartbeat) and that he had fallen over. “Mother lost consciousness and three times she was reanimated,” the man added. An older woman, filmed immediately afterwards in a makeshift bed, complained she was still unable to walk. A third victim, lying prone with clearly inflamed eyes, also described a “fog more like a smoke” after an explosion. “It was very difficult to breathe,” he said, and reported feeling dizzy, that his legs were “a kind of cotton”. A military commander concluded that “toxic substances” or “potent toxic substances of suffocating action were used” – but acknowledged it was not possible to engage in a toxicological analysis because the Ukrainians were living in siege conditions. It is too soon to say definitively what happened. One chemical weapons expert, Dan Kaszeta, the author of a history of nerve agents, cautioned that remote diagnosis was always difficult and questioned why, in the initial report, such a specific medical phrase as vestibulo-atactic syndrome had been used. THREAD #Ukraine #MariupolWas there a chemical attack? What was it?Well, let me say this about that (1/n) It remained unclear whether chemicals, let alone chemical weapons, had been used on the evidence initially available, Kaszeta said, adding that on the site under attack there was “lots of scope … for conventional or incendiary weapons to cause chemical problems because of fires and explosions”. Eliot Higgins, the founder of the Bellingcat investigative journalism agency, said the symptoms described in the video were “inconsistent with any nerve agent I’m familiar with, with no reports of pupil constriction or dilation, convulsions”. Nevertheless, it was critical for Ukrainian forces to try to recover any munitions used – the original report said the gas had been dropped by a drone – which may be possible because chemical weapons shells are designed to release their contents rather than explode. Azov has put out a video with details of the alleged chemical attack in Mariupol, with details of the symptoms from the attack. https://t.co/UAXqUcqo8M pic.twitter.com/bSBYNUXSTR Investigations at the UK Ministry of Defence are continuing, said James Heappey, the armed forces minister, on a morning media round, before going on to say “all options are on the table” in terms of a Nato response, if it were determined that a chemical agent had been used. Joe Biden did warn after the Nato summit last month that the west would respond to any Russian use of chemical weapons in Ukraine with “the nature of the response depending on the nature of the use”. But the effect of the incident – with three victims filmed – appears limited, and it is hard to see it provoking a significant military response at this stage. And with Mariupol surrounded by Russian forces and inaccessible to outsiders there is no prospect of an independent investigation of any of the victims. Fresh information could swiftly alter the picture, but for the moment the incident on Monday may not be as consequential as it was initially feared to have been.",News/World news,Did Russia really use chemical weapons in Ukraine?

4/13/2022,"Jim Cartwright’s northern fairytale is a little faded 30 years after its glittering first debut. Once the play that thrust Jane Horrocks into the public eye, it no longer feels surprising enough to warrant its repeated revivals. This time it is Christina Bianco’s turn to take the role of Little Voice – a quivering, borderline agoraphobic girl who only comes alive when mimicking the vocals of the female singers in her late father’s record collection. But when Ray (Ian Kelsey), one of the boyfriends of her alcohol-fuelled mother, Mari (Shobna Gulati), spots her talent, she is forced to perform for audiences outside the walls of her greying bedroom. In song, Bianco breaks away from her timidity and transforms into something wondrous. But it is Gulati who propels the drama as a flailing, brassy Mari. Dressed in a satin pink robe, she scrappily prowls around after Ray, desperate to hold his attention. Laden with crudeness, the jokes don’t land as neatly as they might have done in 1992. And the neighbour character, Sadie, has suffered a particular hit – the comedy poking fun at her feels dated. Aided by a sliced open doll’s house set, designed by Sara Perks, the production, directed by Bronagh Lagan, peels back the walls of the dysfunctional pair’s family home. And, with two blazing working-class women at its heart, Cartwright’s script still shines a light on the daily hardships of living in economic poverty. Little Voice’s teaching that “no one listens to anyone but themselves”, is significant in a Twitter-dominated world. But ultimately this is a play that has lost its sparkle.

4/13/2022,"Fernandinho has shocked Pep Guardiola by revealing he will leave Manchester City in the summer, with the manager saying this was news to him when asked about the midfielder’s departure. The Brazilian will end a nine‑year career at the Premier League champions in May because he wishes to return to his homeland and play more regularly. Fernandinho has made only 11 starts this season, four since the start of the year, and the 36‑year‑old is unlikely to be in the XI for the Champions League quarter-final second leg at Atlético Madrid on Wednesday. Fernandinho, asked whether he would like to stay another year at City, said: “I don’t think so. Yes, I want to play more; I will go back to Brazil. I decided with my family, which is the most important thing for me. And some people in the club know it.” Yet one of those was not Guardiola. “I didn’t know it,” the manager said. “You gave me the news. We will see what will happen at the end of the season. I said many times we will see what happens.” When asked again, Guardiola said: “I said at the end of the season we will talk – maybe it is a family decision, maybe he wants more minutes. I would love to be with him.” Guardiola suggested that Txiki Begiristain, City’s sporting director, may have known but insisted that Fernandinho revealing his future this way was nothing underhand. “Maybe Txiki knows it and didn’t tell me,” Guardiola said. “I don’t know. It is a surprise for me; I will say to him [Txiki]: ‘What happened?’ But I know his [Fernandinho’s] intentions. Another player would do it for his benefit. Knowing Ferna, it will not be this.” Guardiola can comprehend his reasoning for departing. “Absolutely. I want the happiness of my players and absolutely we are going to play tomorrow for him and give him the best farewell moment, reaching again the semi‑final of the Champions League and try to go through again. “I understand the players want to play, it is completely understandable. Not just because he is 35 or 36. Look what happened with Ferran Torres: he wanted to play [so joined Barcelona]. I understand Ferna wants go back to Brazil, with his father and mother there, and I am pretty sure the club is going to help him do what he wants.” Fernandinho later tweeted: “I was 100% honest and spontaneous in answering that question at today’s press conference. But anyone who knows me also knows that my greatest honesty is with Man City and my duties as team captain.” City hold a 1-0 lead against Atlético. “We can be better than the first leg,” Guardiola said. “It will be different due to the fact we played here [home] and they were defending deep most of the time. It is not going to happen this time. There are moments we will have to defend. You have to adapt. I said after the first leg: ‘You did it perfectly guys.’ We are going to try to go through.” Rúben Dias will travel as part of the squad after recovering from a hamstring injury that has ruled him out since the start of last month.

4/13/2022,"A man has been found guilty of murdering his partner’s three-year-old son, who died in 2018 from severe abdominal injuries after weeks of “horrendous” cruelty. Nathaniel Pope, 32, was found unanimously guilty at Birmingham crown court on Tuesday, while Kemarni Watson Darby’s mother, 30-year-old Alicia Watson, was cleared of murdering her son but found guilty of causing or allowing the child’s death. Kemarni suffered more than 20 rib fractures in weeks of beatings before his death, with experts saying his body had been subjected to force similar to a car crash. Watson and Pope both blamed each other for the injuries, while the jury was told the pair were “partners in crime” who continued to live together for several months after Kemarni’s death. Giving evidence during the trial, Watson said she left her son at home in West Bromwich with Pope on 5 June 2018 while she did the school run. She said she returned to find Kemarni lying on the sofa “staring into space” and floppy and unresponsive, prompting her to call 999. Watson told police at the time Pope had never done anything around her son to cause her concern, but during the trial she said she believed he was responsible for the boy’s death. Kemarni was taken to hospital and placed on a life support machine, which was turned off later that evening when doctors established he would not be able to breathe unaided. Pope, who had previous convictions for common assault, burglary and possession of heroin with intent to supply, is said to have “crushed” Kemarni’s ribcage in the fatal attack. The prosecution said Kemarni had been subjected to “extremely painful” assaults in the months before his death and was left with a split abdomen and major internal bleeding after the brutal assault. A forensic pathologist said the type of injuries Kemarni sustained were normally seen in a fall from a height or in a road traffic collision, and there was also evidence of older injuries including fractures to his ribs. He also suffered extensive internal bruising and lacerations to his liver and colon. Watson told jurors she had taken her son to a GP walk-in centre on the day of his death, with medical notes saying he had been vomiting for five days and was “not his usual self”. Staff prescribed the boy rehydration medication for what was thought to be a viral stomach bug. Kemarni’s father, Darren Darby, told the trial he knew his son was being slapped, punched and kicked by his “strict” mother and said he had warned Watson to be cautious of Pope. “Everybody did know that she was beating Kemarni. We all let him down,” he said. Sam Evans, the manager of Kemarni’s nursery, raised concerns to Watson about injuries, including a split lip, on two occasions, and other family members had also noticed bruising. Pope, of Wolverhampton, and Watson, of Handsworth, Birmingham, were also convicted of a single count each of child cruelty to Kemarni between 1 May and 5 June 2018, relating to the infliction of rib fractures and an abdominal injury prior to the fatal injury. The pair were also separately convicted of two further counts of child cruelty in relation to other children. Both will be sentenced at a later date.",News/UK news,"Man found guilty of murdering partner’s son, three, in West Bromwich",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/12/man-found-guilty-of-murdering-partners-son-in-west-bromwich
4/13/2022,"An asylum seeker who stabbed six people before being shot dead by police had made more than 70 calls seeking help from the Home Office and its contractors, it has emerged. Badreddin Abadlla Adam was shot after he attacked a police officer, hotel staff and fellow asylum seekers at the Park Inn hotel in Glasgow in June 2020 after a serious breakdown in his mental health. A Sudanese refugee, Abadlla Adam was one of hundreds of asylum seekers moved into hotels by the Home Office at the start of the Covid pandemic, encountering cramped and poor conditions, while having no money and being supplied with poor quality meals. A Home Office report into his case, leaked to BBC Scotland, has revealed he made 72 calls to the department, its contractor Mears – which was in charge of the accommodation – and Migrant Help. The evaluation said his repeated calls about his health and his accommodation should have rung alarm bells but there was “no joined-up view” regarding how to assess the implications of his increasingly frequent calls. While the rationale for using hotels during lockdown appeared sound, the review said too little had been done to appreciate the “significant impact” that approach had on asylum seekers’ mental health, given their likely previous trauma. It found the number of calls “individually and cumulatively (when considering the content of the contact) are not indicative of any elevated risk. However, the number of times he was in contact with the Home Office, Mears and Migrant Help – 72 times – about his accommodation and his health should have acted as a warning. “He also complained to staff in the hotel and was in touch with the Home Office about a voluntary assisted return. Each of those inquiries was dealt with appropriately and in keeping with the relevant operating procedures. There was no joined-up view that allowed a comprehensive view of escalation in the nature and frequency of BA’s contact.” Sabir Zazai, the chief executive of the Scottish Refugee Council, said the Home Office was still housing asylum seekers in hotels across the UK, at a cost of £3.5m, despite the Park Inn tragedy. He said the Home Office report into the incident should be published in full.“As this incident shows, being placed in hotel accommodation with very limited funds and no control over your life for long periods can have devastating consequences for the health and wellbeing of people who are only looking to rebuild their lives in safety,” he said. The Home Office said the use of hotels to house asylum seekers had been “unacceptable” and said it had been working hard to find suitable alternatives; that required local councils to provide the right housing, it added. It said lessons had been learned. “Since this horrific incident we have undertaken a number of significant changes to keep asylum seekers safe, including how we, our contractors and charities spot vulnerable individuals and provide them with wraparound support and appropriate accommodation,” it said.",News/UK news,Sudanese refugee made 72 calls seeking help before Glasgow hotel stabbings,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/12/sudanese-refugee-made-72-calls-seeking-help-before-glasgow-hotel-stabbings
4/13/2022,"A prominent Russian opposition activist and outspoken critic of the invasion of Ukraine has been sentenced in Moscow to 15 days in jail on charges of disobeying police orders when leaving his home on Monday night, his lawyer said. Vladimir Kara-Murza, 40, is a veteran Kremlin critic who says he was deliberately poisoned in Moscow in 2015 and 2017 as retaliation for his lobbying efforts to impose US and EU sanctions against Russian officials accused of human rights abuses. A close friend of the opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, who was shot and killed in 2015, Kara-Murza nearly died from kidney failure in the first incident. His longtime lawyer, Vadim Prokhorov, said police had accused Kara-Murza of “changing his walking pace and trying to escape” when they approached him outside his house on Monday evening. It was not immediately clear if Kara-Murza’s arrest was linked to his opposition to Russia’s actions in Ukraine, but it comes amid an unprecedented crackdown on independent media and anti-war dissent. Last month, the Russian parliament passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” news about the military. Kara-Murza, who studied at Cambridge University, has been a vocal opponent of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, launching an anti-war committee with other leading Russian opposition figures. He has also been one of the few prominent opposition figures still living in Russia, as many have fled the country out of safety concerns after the jailing last year of Alexei Navalny. Aleksandr Podrabinek, a former Soviet dissident who went to the Khamovniki police station on Monday to support Kara-Murza, told the independent news outlet Sota that he believed he had been detained because the authorities were “angered by his courage”. Hours prior to his detention, Kara-Murza appeared on CNN where he described the Kremlin as a “regime of murderers”. “I have absolutely no doubt that the Putin regime will end over this war in Ukraine, doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen tomorrow. The two main questions are time and price, and by price, I do not mean monetary – I mean the price of human blood and human lives and it has already been horrendous, but the Putin regime will end over this and there will be a democratic Russia after Putin,” Kara-Murza said.",News/World news,Prominent Russian opposition activist jailed in Moscow,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/prominent-russian-opposition-activist-detained-in-moscow
4/13/2022,"The chief executive of easyJet has insisted that the great summer getaway will not be ruined, despite as many as a fifth of staff being off sick amid a wave of Covid, resulting in hundreds of flight cancellations. Johan Lundgren said the airline had recruited 1,100 new staff in preparation for a summer bookings surge and expects the number of flights easyJet operates to be back to near pre-pandemic levels later this year. However, easyJet is facing weeks of delays getting paperwork processed so new employees can start. “It is true there is a lag on vetting,” he said. “We have about 100 people today awaiting ID clearance from the Department for Transport. I reckon there is a delay on that of roughly three weeks. If we had some of these people in we would have seen less cancellations. “But I know that the government and the aviation industry is looking to fast-track and speed up the process. This is for everyone who needs an ID to go airside, [including] ground handlers and security staff.” Lundgren said about 58 flights had been pre-emptively cancelled across its European network on Tuesday, with 38 of those scheduled from the UK, well down on the 120 to 130 daily cancellations last weekend. “[The number of cancellations] has halved, but that doesn’t change the fact that the crew absence levels, driven by Covid, are pretty much the same,” he said. “It is more the fact that resilience in the business has increased. We will continue to see these numbers come down slightly through April and we will need to monitor this.” He said the typical absence rate among easyJet’s 8,100 crew and 4,300 pilots before Covid was about 6%, while the business had protocols in place to allow it to cope with levels of up to 14%. However, absence rates have been as high as 20%. EasyJet said that despite the severe disruption to flights in the past week, it has flown 94% of the planned schedule, adding that flight volumes of about 1,500 a day were four times those of the same time last year. “This is despite the recent increase in the number of crew testing positive for Covid-19, together with normal operational disruption such as weather and air traffic control delays,” the company said. “We have proactively managed this in advance by making pre-emptive cancellations as early as possible, enabling the majority of our customers to rebook on to flights departing the same day.” Lundgren said the airline had experienced a “strong and sustained recovery” since the government lifted travel restrictions on 24 January. “We remain confident in our plans, which will see us reaching near 2019 flying levels for this summer and emerge as one of the winners in the recovery,” he said. The airline is expecting to report a loss of up to £565m for the six months to the end of March, lower than the £618m forecast by analysts and the £701m loss in the same period in 2021. Capacity in the three months to the end of June is forecast to be at 90% of pre-pandemic levels, with March at 80%. “We continue to see strong demand for the fourth quarter (July to September), especially on leisure routes, where easyJet will be the biggest it has ever been,” the company said. “This has been boosted by the addition of a further five aircraft-worth of slots in Greece. EasyJet will be the largest carrier into the main Greek islands this summer.”",News/Business,EasyJet insists summer getaway safe despite Easter staff illness of up to 20%,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/12/easyjet-summer-bookings-exceed-pre-covid-levels-easter-disruption
4/13/2022,"There are certain phrases that deserve a nod of recognition when they prove to be literally true: anyone who’s ever dug such a big hole that they hit the rock bottom will know what I’m talking about. Or if you’ve ever stood at a ferry terminal realising that you have, in fact, missed the boat. Perhaps this Easter you will unpack your shopping, covered in a slimy, clear film, and understand the error of putting all your eggs in one basket. Personally, I have found myself swimming through actual shit. Not just once, either. Not by a long chalk. Over the past 37 years, I have probably swum through enough sewage to fill a river. Because, you see, it does fill our rivers. And seas. And lakes. And the little streams that snake behind housing estates, and the pools that have the audacity to sit beside poorly maintained pipes. Such is the problem that you would be hard pressed to find any body of water in Britain that a privatised water company hasn’t flushed with turds now and again in the quest for ever-greater profits. All this, of course, is made possible by the particular shrug-it-off brand of Conservativism we are living under that makes everything from environmental damage to tax avoidance just another thing for those in power to turn a blind eye to, as they cut their mates some slack, feather their own nests and sit dreaming of the statues and headed notepaper that are all they really went into politics for in the first place. On 23 April, Surfers Against Sewage is joining forces with campaign groups all over the country for a day of action, demanding an end to sewage pollution. According to Surfers Against Sewage, in 2020 alone, sewage was released into the environment more than 400,000 times, equating to 3.1m hours of discharge. There really is something particularly unpleasant about the phrase “3.1 million hours of discharge”, isn’t there? Only 14% of UK rivers meet “good ecological status” under the EU’s water framework directive, and the UK is ranked last in Europe for bathing water quality. And yet, bathe we do. At least I do. And thousands of other dimple-skinned women I see with swimming costumes, dry robes, flasks and chattering teeth every week, scattered along the riverbank or edge of a lake or pebble beach. I once swam in the Thames. The actual big daddy in London. Joining a group of swimmers and the artist Amy Sharrocks, I slapped bare feet down a stone cutaway and into the river at Hammersmith. It felt particularly bizarre to be doing something as bucolic as swimming while passing bin lorries, City of London parking meters and saddle cranes. Most Londoners consider the Thames a kind of wet motorway full of rusty chains that runs through the city. We don’t think of it as a river at all. But it is a river. And, as illicit and counterintuitive as it feels, you can swim in it (in certain places and with the right permission). It is also, I should say, pretty filthy. During my short swim, I caught a plant pot on one hand, was smacked in the neck by a plank of wood and got an empty crisp packet stuck to my face. But it’s not often litter that will make you ill. It’s the slurry. The raw, untreated litres of liquid poo that water companies frequently pump out into our rivers under the guise of flood drainage. You may remember the 2bn litres of raw sewage dumped in the Thames over just two days back in October 2020. Or more likely you don’t, because the companies that sweep the crap and condoms and wet wipes into our rivers don’t tend to advertise the fact that they have just turned your local waterway into an open sewer. But it happens. It happens all the time. You may not be a swimmer; you may not see the sea from one year to the next; you might find your pleasure in leisure centres rather than lakes. But when faced with corporate negligence, political villainy, environmental destruction and personal illness, we, as a nation, do not have to go with the flow.

4/13/2022,"A young male peregrine falcon that hatched at Salisbury Cathedral two years ago and became an internet star during the early days of the first Covid lockdown has spread his wings and reached the island of Guernsey, more than 100 miles away. Osmund, the only male of four chicks raised on the cathedral tower in spring 2020, was spotted on the coast of the Channel island and identified by his blue ring bearing the initials YK. According to the wildlife charity the RSPB, peregrines usually stay within 60 miles of their birthplace, so Osmund has proved to be something of an adventurer. Salisbury Cathedral said he was probably searching for his own territory and a mate. He is in his full adult plumage and ready to breed. Some peregrines do mate in the first year but most start breeding as two-year-olds. Ed Drewitt of the British Trust for Ornithology, who ringed Osmund, said: “Some Cornish peregrines have reached the French coast. However, I don’t know of any other birds, particularly from this area, flying to the Channel Islands.” Osmund was the first of the 2020 chicks to fledge – develop wing feathers large enough to fly. He was named after St Osmund, the first bishop of Salisbury, who built the original cathedral at Old Sarum, two miles north of the modern city. His three female siblings were named after individuals who played a significant role in the cathedral’s early history: Ela, Katherine and Honor, to mark the 800th anniversary of the building’s foundation. Seven hundred people took part in the public vote after the peregrine webcam became one of the unusual sources of joy and succour people turned to at the start of the Covid pandemic. Only two other peregrines have been spotted since fledging from the cathedral tower. Peter, who hatched in 2014, was shot near Stockbridge, Hampshire, in March 2017 and nursed for more than two months by the Hawk Conservancy Trust before being released back into the wild. He has since been nesting with his mate in a Hampshire quarry and has fledged his own chicks. The other peregrine spotted away from home was Aveline, a female that fledged in 2016 and was spotted in a Milton Keynes nature reserve in January 2017. More than half of the peregrines that fledge annually do not survive their first year and, despite being protected by law, are still persecuted.",News/Environment,Wing and a preyer: Salisbury Cathedral’s star falcon flies nest to Guernsey,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/12/salisbury-cathedral-star-falcon-flies-nest-guernsey-osmund
4/13/2022,"Though equivocal about many aspects of religion, Graham Greene had nearly supernatural gifts of prophecy as a novelist. The Quiet American (1955) spookily previewed America’s disaster in Vietnam. Three years later, Our Man in Havana, in which an English expat vacuum cleaner salesman in Cuba sells fake secrets to MI6 for cash, was an espionage farce that turned serious with the Iraq “dodgy dossier” and other blurring of fact and fabrication. Greene’s spy fiction heir, John le Carré, so admired Our Man in Havana that he wrote an acknowledged homage in The Tailor of Panama. In their musical version, world premiering at the picturesque and enterprising Watermill, Richard Hough (book and lyrics) and Ben Morales Frost (music), are alert to both the story’s topicalities about the unreliability of information and the chain of literary heritage. One of the strongest songs, The Perfect Spy, alluding to a Le Carré title, nicely honours two of the greatest English writers about public and private deceit. The score is geographically two-tone – mambo and rumba rhythms for locals, such as the twice-reprised The Streets of Havana – and Noël Cowardly recitative and patter for Nigel Lister’s imperfect spy James Wormold. As Milly, the teenager whose shopping and equestrian bills lead her divorced father to trade falsehoods, Daniella Agredo Piper appropriately moves between the musical dual nationalities. The performers deserve an ensemble award for astonishing multi-skilling. Lister accompanies on double bass or guitar the few scenes he isn’t in. Adam Keast, fast-changing between the parts of a Whitehall spymaster and a Cuban secret policeman, also finds time for string and percussion. Paula James plays two contrasting women, plus guitar and drums. On the tiny stage, Abigail Pickard Price’s neat direction somehow prevents anyone getting pranged by bow, drumstick or the quick-change bits of Kat Heath’s ingenious set, in which pianos suddenly become urinals, bookcases or cars. As is often the case with new musicals, it feels another rigorous workshop away from becoming the absolute pleasure attainable. In the second half, the book contains too much novel: Greene’s great scene of a game of draughts with spirit miniatures as pieces is curiously spoken, not sung. But while the novel has dated in some ways – its first line of dialogue contains the n-word – this show enjoyably and intelligently distils Greene’s lasting truths about lying. Our Man in Havana is at the Watermill theatre, Newbury, until 21 May.",Arts/Stage,Our Man in Havana review – Graham Greene classic becomes a clever musical,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/12/our-man-in-havana-review-graham-greene-classic-becomes-a-clever-musical
4/13/2022,"Tyson Fury and other senior figures in boxing have been warned to cut all ties with the Irish alleged crime boss Daniel Kinahan, whose gang was targeted with fresh sanctions and a $5m (£3.8m) bounty by the US government on Tuesday. The WBC heavyweight champion has previously praised Kinahan, a founder of the boxing management company MTK Global, and was photographed with him just weeks ago in Dubai. But in an extraordinary press conference in Dublin, the US ambassador to Ireland, Claire Cronin, revealed that the department of the treasury is now offering a reward of $5m for information that will lead to the “financial destruction” of the Kinahan organised crime group (KOGC) or the arrest and conviction of its leaders. It came after the US Treasury imposed sanctions on Kinahan and another six of the group’s alleged ringleaders – including his father, Christopher Sr, and brother, Christopher Jr – banning banks and other companies from doing business with them. Kinahan, who attempted to make a proposed all-British super-fight pitting Fury against Anthony Joshua last year and is involved with several boxers, has become one of the most influential figures in the sport. Recently he also received the “full support” of the World Boxing Council president, Mauricio Sulaiman, who praised him for “improving boxers’ lives in a special way”. However the Irish police commissioner, Drew Harris, said anyone in boxing who deals with Kinahan should be in no doubt they were involving themselves with serious criminals. “What was implicit before, and what some individuals could choose to ignore, is absolutely explicit — if you deal with the individuals who are sanctioned as part of the Kinahan organised crime gang, you are dealing with criminals engaged in drug trafficking,” he said. “And, indeed, as we have seen here very tragically in Ireland and also in Spain, murderous feuds [and people] who will resort to vicious actions up to and including murder.” Harris, who said the Kinahan gang was worth more than €1bn (£830m) through its criminal enterprise, was asked specifically about Daniel Kinahan’s links to sport. “If you deal with these individuals who have been sanctioned, or these entities who are being sanctioned, you are involved in a criminal network,” he replied. Harris also had a message for broadcasters, such as BT Sport, Sky, the BBC and TalkSport who have continued to show Fury’s fights and other boxers associated with MTK. “I’d ask them to look at their own business, at the probity of their own business and the relationship with their fans and, really, is this something they want to be involved with in terms of their legitimate business,” he said. “I think the answer to that is a resounding no.” The Guardian has asked all four broadcasters for a response. Fury, the WBC champion, is defending his title against Dillian Whyte in an all-British fight in London on 23 April, a fight that will be shown on BT Sport and aired by TalkSport. The Kinahan crime gang, which emerged in Dublin in the 1990s has been called one of the world’s largest organised crime groups by the US Drug Enforcement Agency. In a statement announcing new sanctions against the cartel overnight the US under-secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, Brian E Nelson, said the gang “smuggles deadly narcotics, including cocaine, to Europe, and is a threat to the entire licit economy through its role in international money laundering”. “Criminal groups like the KOCG prey on the most vulnerable in society and bring drug-related crime and violence, including murder, to the countries in which they operate,” he added. Matt Horne, a deputy director of the UK’s National Crime Agency, which has previously secured convictions against two other senior members of the crime group, said the sanctions would be a significant setback. He said: “We target criminals who cause the most harm, are the most violent, those who exploit the vulnerable, and dominate communities. The Kinahan crime group falls into all of those categories. “They have transcended international boundaries – distributing multimillion-pound shipments of drugs throughout Ireland, the UK and mainland Europe, and have been engaging in firearms trafficking and money laundering. “They thought they were untouchable but the sanctions imposed today will be a huge blow to the Kinahans. It has cut them off from the global financial system, making them toxic to legitimate businesses and financial institutions, and will cause other criminals to think twice about doing business with them.” The US also sanctioned three businesses identified as “Kinahan associates”, including Hoopoe Sports, based in the United Arab Emirates, which lists five boxers as clients according to its website: Paddy Barnes, Jamie Conlan, Michael Conlan, Hughie Fury, and Billy Joe Saunders. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by those fighters. Kinahan, who is now based in Dubai and has no criminal convictions, has always denied any wrongdoing.",Sport/Sport,Tyson Fury warned to cut ties with alleged crime boss Daniel Kinahan,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/12/tyson-fury-warned-to-cut-ties-with-alleged-crime-boss-daniel-kinahan-boxing
4/13/2022,"American Keira Woods (Elisha Cuthbert) and her Irish husband Brian (Eoin Macken) appear to work in some kind of social network-specific marketing, figuring out how to best push content at target audiences. It’s the sort of new-fangled, 21st-century area of entrepreneurial endeavour people seem to love to hate, perhaps because the work seems so invisible and inchoate yet vastly remunerative. Given the moral calculus of horror films, that means they’re ripe to become the targets of even more insidious forces. And so it goes, when they buy an abandoned mansion in the Irish exurbs and move in with their two kids – sulky teenager Ellie (Abby Fitz), none too pleased with the move, and amiable younger brother Steven (Dylan Fitzmaurice Brady). Ironically, given their work presumably relies on manipulative algorithms and metrics, the evil resident in their new home seems to have something to do with the mathematical symbols carved into the stones over the doorways and walls. The murky explication dump halfway through – courtesy of a maths professor (Aaron Monaghan) who had a car accident and went from being practically innumerate to a maths savant – as you do – adds physicist Erwin Schrödinger to our old friend and Satanic avatar Baphomet, and multiplies the sum with some hushed mentions of alchemy to suggest the house’s cellar is a gateway to somewhere unpleasant. Surely this will have a terrible effect on the property’s resale value. Writer-director Brendan Muldowney is better at contriving striking images of horror, filmed with umbral gloom by cinematographer Tom Comerford, than at the character and story stuff. There’s something very odd, for instance, about the way one of the kids goes missing and the parents appear to practically shrug and get back to work. And the sudden introduction of an addled old dear (Marie Mullen) prophesying doom is pure horror movie cliche, but there are a few genuine scares along the way that work well enough.

4/13/2022,"Anti-fossil fuel activists have vowed to continue blockading oil terminals until they are jailed, as they approached 1,000 arrests for their actions so far. “Ministers have a choice: they can arrest and imprison Just Stop Oil supporters or agree to no new oil and gas,” Just Stop Oil said on Tuesday morning. “While Just Stop Oil supporters have their liberty the disruption will continue.” Fuel-blockade activists were taking their first day off in 12 days on Tuesday, after beginning their campaign on 1 April. “We decided to give them a break,” a campaign spokesperson said. About 400 people have been arrested a total of 900 times for taking action so far, according to the campaign. On Monday, about 40 were arrested at Inter Terminals in Grays, Essex, some after spending more than 38 hours locked on to pipework above the loading bay. Between 15 and 20 who had helped dig tunnels under access roads to the Kingsbury oil terminal were arrested on Sunday and Monday, Just Stop Oil said. The campaign’s statement came after the prime minister’s spokesperson condemned protesters’ “guerrilla tactics” and the home secretary complained that “people across the country [were] seeing their lives brought to a standstill”. On Tuesday, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy accused Labour’s Steve Reed, the shadow justice minister, of “irresponsible scaremongering” after he said “millions” could not get fuel because of the protests. “Just Stop Oil protest activity at some oil terminals has led to short-term disruptions to fuel deliveries over the past few days. The police are working to remove protesters from sites so normal deliveries can resume,” a BEIS spokesperson said. “We are working closely with industry to ensure that supplies are maintained. The public should continue to purchase fuel as normal.” Disruption continued elsewhere. In London, the Lloyd’s insurance market stopped trading on Tuesday after about 60 activists from Extinction Rebellion blocked the entrances to its headquarters and stopped workers from getting inside. “People used superglue, chains and bike locks to block over 25 entrances to the building. Staff already inside were allowed to exit. Climbers also scaled the outside of the iconic building and dropped two banners, saying ‘End Fossil Fuels Now’ and ‘Insure Climate Justice’,” XR said. XR had called on supporters to take a week off work and join mass actions in London this week. After a weekend in which protests had blocked the West End and two bridges over the Thames, on Monday and Tuesday the plan was for “outreach” activities, with members asked to go door-to-door to talk to people about government inaction on the climate crisis. The outreach activities were part of the XR’s 3.5% project, which has mobilised members of local XR groups to spread the group’s message in their communities. “Since we launched in January, over 70 local groups have taken part, we’ve had nearly 4,000 conversations on the doorstep and more than 80% of those who have seen the talk have signed up to join XR,” XR said. Some members of XR have privately said the canvassing has proven difficult, with thousands of flyers handed out in some areas of the country to get just a few dozen to in-person meetings. But others say such activities had helped to achieve a better than expected mobilisation for the weekend’s protest actions. Mass actions were to resume on Wednesday, according to a timetable circulated by XR, with supporters asked to gather from 10am in Hyde Park. Meanwhile, more than 80 scientists, signed a letter to Greg Hands, the energy minister, saying they support the call made by a hunger striker for a climate change briefing for all MPs from Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientist. As Angus Rose began his 30th day without food, the scientists, including Sir David King, the former chief scientific adviser, Prof Julia Steinberger, an author on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and Prof Susan Michie, a member of the government’s Sage advisory body, said they “unanimously support” the idea of the briefing – even if they did not all agreed with Rose’s methods. “The crisis is evolving at a rapid pace, and it is increasingly difficult for politicians to understand the significance of the latest science that they do not have time to read and digest,” the letter states.",News/Environment,Just Stop Oil protesters vow to continue until ‘all are jailed’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/12/just-stop-oil-protesters-vow-to-continue-until-all-are-jailed
4/13/2022,"This week, climate activists disrupted the UK’s oil supply, because they believe they face a desperate choice. Nonviolent resistance now, or the unthinkable violence of climate change later. “There is a need to break the law,” says Just Stop Oil’s Melissa Carrington, “so we are not guilty of greater crime.” But is she right? In so-called liberal democracies, we have a default obligation to obey the law. It’s a moral duty, as well as a legal one. It’s part of our implicit contract with the government we elected,which provides us, in return, with the protection of justice. But what happens when that government doesn’t keep its side of the bargain? Then, according to numerous political thinkers, we not only can, but very possibly should, break some laws: peacefully, publicly and on principle. The aim? To bring policy into line with what justice actually requires. Henry David Thoreau gave this a name: civil disobedience. John Rawls, as pivotal a social contract thinker as you are likely to find, thought it could be good for social stability and justice, so long as it challenged longstanding, serious injustice. And what could be more unjust than supporting an industry that kills people? We can be more or less controversial here. Is civil disobedience morally OK because governments aren’t progressive enough when it comes to protecting non-humans? Because they allow sentient animals to be tortured in factory farms, or 30% of species to be wiped out by the climate crisis? Some philosophers, such as Peter Singer, think so. Our fellow animals, they say, are entitled to political consideration even though they can’t participate in democratic decision-making. Others point out, less provocatively, that although a government is mainly answerable to those living within its own borders, it still owes basic justice to other humans. It shouldn’t give them encephalitis or dengue fever, or starve them to death. There are grounds for disobedience even if we think only about what governments should and shouldn’t do to their own citizens. The climate crisis threatens our children and grandchildren with heatwaves, floods, wildfires, and untold mental anguish. By propping up the fossil fuel industry, our government puts their whole future in jeopardy. If that’s not a serious injustice, I’m not sure what is. Then there’s environmental resistance. Rather than grabbing attention through general disruption, the activists aim to prevent injustice, directly. “This isn’t like sitting in the middle of random roads,” says Zak, a 15-year-old activist who was arrested as part of the Just Stop Oil protests. “As well as saying to the government, ‘We are demanding no new oil and gas extraction in the North Sea’, it is also stopping the gears of production.” Is this better, or worse? The philosophers Ten-Herng Lai and Chong-Ming Lim think it’s fairer to inconvenience oil and gas giants than the general public, because they’re the ones doing the harm. Or think about it like this. If activists focus on preventing states from extracting oil or natural gas, they might do something else as well: challenge government overreach. “Some philosophers question whether territorial rights should extend to underground natural resources,” says Megan Blomfield, a senior lecturer at the University of Sheffield, “since it’s not like anybody did anything to put them there. And where the resource is scarce or its use can harm other people, there’s additional reason to question any entitlement for the state to do what it likes with it.” Of course, caveats remain. Is this mass law-breaking a last resort? It looks like it. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been issuing warnings for 32 years now, but states’ commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions fall abysmally short of limiting global warming to 1.5C. Actual policies put us on track for a terrifying 2.7C increase by 2100, and the UK shows no sign of doing its fair share. And will it work? It might, if the numbers are right. “We’ve seen through history that the only way mass change is achieved is through these mass campaigns like the women’s suffrage or the civil rights movements,” says Zak. It makes sense to diversify tactics. Just activism should be inclusive, and risking arrest is only a viable strategy for the comparatively privileged, not those already at the receiving end of police intimidation. There’s also evidence that successful movements use a range of approaches, from lobbying and voting to strikes and, yes, civil disobedience. But social scientists Maria Stephan and Erica Chenoweth studied major resistance campaigns between 1900 and 2006 and found that the nonviolent ones succeeded more than half the time. (More than twice as often, incidentally, as the violent ones.) The key to success? The so-called “3.5% rule”, because that’s the proportion of the population that needs to get involved. And here’s something else to bear in mind. These movements also challenge participatory injustice, where those with most at stake are excluded from decision-making. Many climate protesters are too young to vote. They are denied a voice in determining their own future, while politicians accept gifts worth millions from climate sceptics and fossil fuel interests. Through activism, including civil disobedience, they demand to be heard. When future generations look back on this period, as we look back on earlier epoch-defining campaigns, they’ll ask who showed more respect for justice and democracy: the activists so many of us find disruptive, or the governments they are trying to reform. I think we know what their answer will be.

4/13/2022,"Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are to receive fixed-penalty notices for breaking Covid laws after a police investigation into Downing Street parties during lockdown, leading to calls for them both to resign. In an unprecedented development, the prime minister and his chancellor were both set to be fined for breaking their own emergency laws brought in to protect the country during the pandemic. They are believed to be the first prime minister and chancellor to have broken the law while in office. Carrie Johnson, the prime minister’s wife, is also set to receive a fixed penalty notice, her spokesperson confirmed. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, called on Johnson and Sunak to resign. “Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have broken the law and repeatedly lied to the British public,” he said. There are also questions over whether Johnson misled parliament, as he told MPs in the Commons that all Covid rules were followed. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, also called for the prime minister to quit. “Boris Johnson must resign,” she said. “He broke the law and repeatedly lied to parliament about it. The basic values of integrity and decency - essential to the proper working of any parliamentary democracy - demand that he go. And he should take his out of touch chancellor with him.” The fines relate to parties held in Downing Street during lockdown and are likely to include a gathering in the cabinet room for Johnson’s birthday in June 2020, which was also attended by Sunak. However, No 10 gave no details on how many events the prime minister will be fined for attending and would not say whether he would contest the fine – likely to be £20 or £50 – or pay them straight away. A No 10 spokesperson said: “The prime minister and chancellor of the Exchequer have today received notification that the Metropolitan police intend to issue them with fixed penalty notices. We have no further details, but we will update you again when we do.” It comes after the Met said it had issued more than 50 fines, with Starmer saying the “widespread criminality” called into question Boris Johnson’s honesty and integrity.The force has been investigating 12 gatherings, including some in the Downing Street garden, inside No 10, and one in the prime minister’s own residence at No 11. The fines are likely to prompt renewed speculation over Johnson’s leadership, after he faced a significant threat from his own party over the scandal earlier this year. Some Conservative MPs have previously said a line would be crossed by allowing a prime minister to remain in office if he is found to have broken the law. About 20-30 MPs were at one point thought to have submitted letters of no confidence in the prime minister, with 54 needed to trigger a leadership challenge. However, some have backed away from the idea of removing Johnson as leader since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, arguing now is not the time to change leader. People are referred by the police for fines to the Criminal Records Office (ACRO) if officers have a “reasonable belief” that the law has been broken. If Johnson and Sunak were to contest the fines, it would be likely to be dealt with via the single justice procedure in a magistrates court – behind closed doors as with thousands of other Covid fines imposed during lockdown.Starmer told the BBC: “This is further evidence that blows the PM’s defence out of the water. He told the country, he told parliament, that all the rules had been complied with in Downing Street., where he lives and works, and now it is obvious there was widespread criminality.“I’m afraid it calls into even further question the honesty and integrity of the prime minister, who stood up and said nothing was going on that shouldn’t have been going on. It’s obvious that was wrong and it reflects very badly on the prime minister.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak fined for breaking lockdown laws,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/12/boris-johnson-and-rishi-sunak-fined-for-breaking-covid-lockdown-laws
4/13/2022,"Tribal communities will soon have access to $46m to tackle effects of the climate crisis, which disproportionately threaten Indigenous Americans’ food supplies, livelihoods and infrastructure. The funds are part of a historic five-year investment plan under Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law, intended to improve climate resilience and adaptation in tribal territories. Some communities will have to relocate because of rising sea levels and storm surges. “As the effects of climate change continue to intensify, Indigenous communities are facing unique climate-related challenges that pose existential threats to tribal economies, infrastructure, lives and livelihoods,” said Deb Haaland, the secretary of the interior and America’s first Indigenous cabinet secretary. “President Biden’s historic investments in tribal communities will help bolster community resilience, replace aging infrastructure and provide support needed for climate-related community-driven relocation and adaptation.” Across the US, the climate crisis, caused by unchecked greenhouse gas emissions, poses particular threats to Indigenous culture and livelihoods closely tied to local ecosystems. Of the 574 federally recognized tribes in the US, 40% live in Alaska Native communities, where rapidly rising temperatures, melting sea ice and glaciers, and thawing permafrost are causing significant problems for critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges and housing. Alaska Natives are among America’s first climate refugees, with almost 90% of villages susceptible to flooding and erosion. In the south-west, inland communities including the Navajo and Tohono O’odham nations face worsening drought and extreme heat. Indigenous people across the world have contributed almost nothing to greenhouse gas emissions that cause global heating, having once thrived through ecologically sustainable agriculture, fishing and hunting traditions. Yet traditional medicines, foods such as fish and game, and wild and cultivated crops are now in decline, Access is often further limited by reservation boundaries. By the end of the century, more than half of US salmon and trout habitats are expected to be lost. Many tribes have relied on such fish for food, cultural practices and economic development. Biden’s infrastructure law provides $466m to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, including $216m for climate resilience programs. Of that funding, $130m is provided for community relocation, $86m is provided for climate resilience and adaptation projects, and $43.2m will be available to spend annually for five years. Tribes can submit proposals to the Department of the Interior for a share of the first installment of new funding, which promises to recognise tribal ecological knowledge and traditional sustainable practices, and to support community-driven rather than imposed relocation. While the money has been welcomed, it is nowhere near enough, or supplied fast enough, to combat the effects of extreme heat, rising sea level, flooding and other climate phenomena which are already causing chaos.",News/World news,US indigenous communities to receive $46m to address global heating,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/us-indigenous-communities-46m-global-heating

Kamala Harris, sitting in the fifth row with her sister Maya, blew kisses through a black face mask and applauded her husband. It was one of those only-in-Washington moments. On Monday, the Shakespeare Theatre Company hosted a “mock trial” inspired by William Shakespeare’s romantic comedy Much Ado About Nothing and presided over by retiring supreme court justice and good sport Stephen Breyer. Much Ado is best known for Beatrice and Benedick, two proud intellects who only fall in love after others play Cupid. That seemed fitting for Harris and Emhoff, who were set up on a blind date by a mutual friend and married just shy of their 50th birthdays. But the question before the not-so-serious court was: should Margaret be held liable for Don John’s defamation of Hero? Emhoff, who was a prominent entertainment lawyer for nearly 30 years, was lead advocate on Margaret’s behalf. The event, full of inside-the-Beltway topical gags, had been due to take place last month but was postponed after the second gentleman came down with coronavirus. “I thank your honours for granting my motion for a continuance due to plague,” began Emhoff, wearing a dark suit, blue shirt and blue tie, and standing at a lectern under bright stage lights. “The White House apothecary told me my symptoms would be wild but – whew!” The mock trial is a longstanding Shakespeare Theatre Company tradition but had gone virtual for the past couple of years, due to the pandemic. Monday marked a return to an in-person audience at the Sidney Harman Hall but it was also livestreamed. Emhoff, an amiable and slightly goofy presence, remarked: “My parents tonight are watching the livestream but I might have told them that I was arguing in front of the United States supreme court so, cameraperson, can you just keep a very tight shot … ?” The second gentleman faced quick-fire questioning from Breyer and four leading judges from the District of Columbia and Virginia. “How do you define woman?” asked one, a nod to the recent esoteric questioning of the supreme court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson by Republican senators. Tongue firmly in cheek, Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she was interested in Beatrice and Benedick. “He says he doesn’t want to marry anyone but I think it’s clear from the text that his real concern is that if he marries somebody who’s really pretty and is really smart and witty, she could turn out to be the one who is better known and more prominent than he is.” There was laughter from the audience. There was more when Emhoff responded dryly: “As I say, your honour, I used to be somebody.” The judges – relishing a chance to let their hair down – also made references to Will Smith’s slap of Chris Rock at the Oscars, Britney Spears’s conservatorship, Downton Abbey, Republicans Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck. Emhoff was careful not get too political. One judge asked: “So when Beatrice tore up her love letters, making them unavailable to investigators, was that a violation of the imperial records act? If so, is Merrick Garland going to get around to that?” The second gentleman demurred: “There’s certain things I’m not allowed to talk about.” But he did take a deft swipe at Donald Trump’s oldest son, during his defence of Margaret. “She was just an unwitting pawn in the scheme of the real villain here, the self-described villain: Don Jr – I mean, Don John.” The case against Margaret was put by Debra Katz, a DC litigator and founding partner of Katz, Marshall & Banks. The judges and the theatre audience ruled in her favour, whereas the audience watching via livestream sided with Emhoff. Harris then took to the stage, gave Emhoff a hug, posed for photos and and spoke with those assembled including Britain’s Simon Godwin, artistic director of the Shakespeare Theatre Company. Someone managed to get a selfie with Emhoff before the Secret Service trod the boards and encouraged Harris to exit, stage right.",News/US news,Much ado about Doug: second gentleman takes spotlight at Shakespeare debate,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/12/much-ado-doug-emhoff-shakespeare-debate-kamala-harris
4/13/2022,"The attempt by Crispin Blunt to taint a court’s verdict of sexual assault against the former Tory MP Imran Ahmad Khan will put the apparent culture of impunity at the Palace of Westminster in the spotlight again. While the #MeToo scandal led to major reforms to try to protect staff members and parliamentary aides from bullying and abuse, there have been multiple attempts over the past few years to cast aspersions on those seeking justice. Three Conservative MPs in recent years have been found by courts to have committed sexual assault or rape, two of them with character references provided by fellow Conservatives. Throughout the trial, Ahmad Khan sought to block reporting of the case in which a jury found he had plied a teenager with alcohol and assaulted him. Blunt, a former justice minister, said he had been prepared to give evidence to defend Ahmad Khan, but according to reporters who covered the trial, he had not attended for the prosecution’s case, where the victim’s parents were said to have been reduced to tears describing the effect of the assault on their teenage boy. Blunt attended only for the defence and summing up. But he was not the only Tory MP to come to Ahmad Khan’s aid. Sir Peter Bottomley, the father of the house, attended court on Monday, and another MP, Adam Holloway, provided a character statement used as part of Ahmad Khan’s defence. Blunt has apologised and resigned from the all-party parliamentary group on LGBT+ rights he chaired. But others have made similar interventions, sometimes without serious sanction. Natalie Elphicke, who took the parliamentary seat of her former Tory MP husband Charlie Elphicke when he was convicted of sexual assault, signed a witness statement calling his victim a liar, according to the Sunday Times. She remains a Tory vice-chair. Holloway was also among four Tory MPs described as a “protection racket” for Elphicke. Along with Natalie Elphicke, the MPs Sir Roger Gale, Theresa Villiers and Bob Stewart signed a letter – using parliamentary stationery – putting pressure on a senior judge to intervene to stop the publication of their character statements for Elphicke in his trial. The Commons standards committee called it “egregious behaviour … corrosive to the rule of law and, if allowed to continue unchecked, could undermine public trust in the independence of judges”. Victims have long complained that political convenience can trump complaints even at the very highest level. Charlie Elphicke was given the Tory whip back shortly before the vote of no confidence in Theresa May, as was the suspended MP Andrew Griffiths, who had sent a slew of inappropriate texts to young women. Griffiths was later found by a high court judge to have raped and abused his wife, in what the judge called “coercive and controlling behaviour”. Two other MPs, suspended from the party, are still in parliament despite serious allegations against them. David Warburton has been accused by three women of sexual harassment, as well as being pictured with what is said to be lines of cocaine. Rob Roberts, whose seat in Delyn, north Wales, would likely fall to Labour if he faced a recall, has continued sitting as an independent after refusing to step down despite being suspended from the Commons for six weeks last May for making repeated and unwanted sexual advances towards a former member of staff. Parliamentary technicalities have let Roberts off the hook of a recall petition –and though rules have now been changed they are conveniently not retrospective. By and large, it has been the Conservative party in the spotlight but Labour is not immune – the former MP Mike Hill was found by an employment tribunal to have repeatedly sexually assaulted and harassed a parliamentary staff member. In the case of Hill, Keir Starmer has shown he is prepared to take a politically difficult decision, forcing Hill to resign and call a byelection, in which the party lost the seat to the Conservatives. But at least one MP tried to intervene to help Hill, too. A tribunal heard how Kate Hollern, then a shadow communities minister and former aide to Jeremy Corbyn, attempted to dissuade the Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen from offering support to Hill’s staff member. And both parties have been accused of having intolerably slow internal complaints processes. The Labour activist Ava Etemadzadeh waited three years for the party to investigate her claims against the then Labour shadow cabinet minister Kelvin Hopkins, which he denied and then quit before it could be concluded. In Ahmad Khan’s case, there remain serious questions about the complaint the victim said he made to the Conservative press office – of which it says there is no record – where he suggests the officer did not take any action when he told them about the police complaint shortly before the 2019 election. Dogged campaigning by victims, staffers and some committed MPs has meant significant reforms have taken place to help tackle the culture of impunity that was highlighted in the #MeToo scandal. But there remains a question about how many MPs are committed to that reform – and how many do believe their status as elected representatives gives them special privilege, even in matters of law.",News/Politics,Crispin Blunt’s defence of sex offender MP revives stench of impunity,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/12/crispin-blunt-defence-sex-offender-revives-stench-impunity
4/13/2022,"When Hazel McCallion retired in 2014 as the mayor of the Canadian city of Mississauga, she was 93. But while most people her age typically retreat from the spotlight of public life, “Hurricane Hazel” has shown little interest in slowing down. At 101, she recently accepted an offer to extend her role as a director for the greater Toronto airport authority, a contract that will last three years. Omar Alghabra, Canada’s transport minister, congratulated the centenarian, commending her four decades of community service and her future “overseeing and guiding Canada’s largest airport”. The job extension was announced last week, less than a month after she renewed her role as special adviser to the University of Toronto Mississauga, with the school praising her “encyclopaedic knowledge of politics”. Known for her blunt demeanour and pugilistic style of governing, McCallion has loomed large over Ontario civics for decades, despite her diminutive height. A school, library, parade and baseball team all bear her name. A light rail project dubbed the Hazel McCallion Line was announced in February. “She looms very large in Ontario politics, far beyond what one would expect simply by reading the statutes about the powers of a mayor,” said Tom Urbaniak, a professor of political science at Cape Breton university and author of a book about McCallion. “One former premier remarked, ‘She’s the one politician in Ontario who scares the bejesus out of me.’ So whenever she wants to pronounce on an issue to this day – whenever she wants to wade into something – it gets noticed.” Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, described McCallion as the “icon of Canada” at a celebration of her 100th birthday last year. “I love her, she’s a mentor and she’s taught me so much and she’s always there for everyone,” he said. Ford arrived at the event wearing an Ontario Women’s Hockey Association jersey with the name “Hazel” on the back and the number 100 – a nod to her stint as a professional hockey player earlier in her life. Born in Port Daniel, Quebec, in 1921, McCallion was the youngest of five children during the Depression. She later found work at an engineering firm in Montreal and played professional hockey, making C$5 per game – a figure worth nearly C$100 today. The engineering firm relocated her to Toronto, where in middle age she developed a keen interest in local politics. McCallion held various municipal roles before running for mayor of Mississauga in 1978 – defeating an incumbent who suggested during his campaign that her gender was a political weakness. “She was a pragmatic populist and she has an incredible ability to feel the public pulse, even before the public feels it,” Urbaniak said. McCallion shopped at different grocery stores each week to better understand the frustrations of constituents. She would then carefully place those grievances into stump speeches. “That’s a knack that she never lost.” McCallion stayed on as mayor for the next 36 years as the city grew from a patchwork of farmland west of Toronto into Canada’s seventh-largest city. She finally stepped down in 2014 with her political instincts intact: she endorsed the eventual winners of Ontario’s two most recent provincial elections, as well as Justin Trudeau before his successful bid for prime minister in 2015. Despite her influence, or because of it, McCallion has brushed up against allegations that she breached conflict of interest rules. In 1982, a court determined she had failed to abstain from council discussions over a planning decision in which she had an interest. In 2009, she faced accusations that a proposed convention centre and luxury hotel would have benefited her son, whose company had a financial stake in the project worth millions. A judge involved in the inquiry concluded her actions amounted to “real and apparent conflict of interest”. McCallion insisted she had done nothing wrong and the case was thrown out in 2013. Urbaniak says he laughed when he heard that McCallion had renewed her contract with the region’s airport authority. “She will stay active as long as she can,” he said. “But she was famously in a years-long running battle with the former head of the airport authority. He thought he would get the better of Hazel McCallion. And he didn’t.”",News/World news,"‘Hurricane Hazel’: Canada political icon, 101, still flying high as airport director",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/hazel-mccallion-101-canada-mississauga-airport
4/13/2022,"According to Conservative MP Crispin Blunt, the conviction of fellow MP Imran Ahmad Khan for child sexual assault was just based on “lazy tropes about LGBT+ people”. Amazing, really, that it was the chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on LGBT+ issues who was the only person seemingly making a link between gay men and paedophilia in the wake of Khan being found guilty of assaulting a 15-year-old boy, after plying him with alcohol. I want to say “you had ONE job, Crispin”, but I see that among other things, the Reigate MP is a paid board member of a hotel group. So … you had SOME jobs, Crispin. But let’s be crystal clear here: none of them was you, a former minister of justice, claiming that child sexual assault was “an event that was minor on any scale”. In reality, the only minor involved was the victim. If you missed it, this is the story of the Wakefield MP, Imran Ahmad Khan, who has now been expelled from the Tory party after yesterday’s conviction at Southwark crown court. He will naturally be appealing and remaining as an MP while he does that – and we’ll come to the section on the expanding number of Commons crims in a bit. Anyway, once the guilty verdict came in, Crispin Blunt – that mangled instance of nominative determinism – opted not to shut up/pipe down/fail to chime in. Instead, Blunt decided that the case was “a dreadful miscarriage of justice”, and promptly posted a lengthy and clearly considered statement calling it “nothing short of an international scandal”. Even more boggling was the bit where Blunt described the entire business for Khan as “this nightmare start to his parliamentary career”. Start to it? A way of putting it that reminds us that once we’ve put this silly business of child sexual assault behind us, Imran should be expected to ascend swiftly toward at least the cabinet without further trifling impediment. Anyway. As of Tuesday morning, Blunt has quit his chairmanship of the APPG, after a spate of resignations looked like reducing its next meeting to a room empty but for the presence of Blunt and his self-regard. Admittedly, you would still need a room slightly larger than the vehicle assembly room at the Kennedy Space Centre, sometimes cited as the largest single chamber on Earth. But it also tells you something about the size of the shit sandwich that he has served himself that the eternally shameless Blunt has actually cottoned on that he has to quit and apologise for his comments. Unless there is something wildly askew with parliamentary ethics, he will be now be relieved of the Tory whip, ideally before I begin typing the next paragraph. And yet, I hate to break out the spoilers this soon, but I’m afraid there IS something wildly askew with parliamentary ethics. And, indeed, Westminster ethics beyond the chamber. Starting with those first, the victim explained that he contacted the Conservative press office before Khan was elected in Wakefield in 2019, and informed them that he had been sexually assaulted by him as a child, and that there was a police report of the matter. Nothing whatsoever seems to have been done. “I wasn’t taken very seriously,” he said. “She said, ‘Well … ’ and that’s it. I said, ‘I’m going to the police’ and she said, ‘Well, you do that.’” Blunt was not the only one to defend Khan. A character statement was provided to his defence by Adam Holloway, who you may recall also provided a character statement for former Tory MP Charlie Elphicke, who was convicted of sex offences against two women. Holloway was subsequently forced to apologise for his attempt to stop that statement being made public. Still, he is in … well, you wouldn’t call it good company, would you, but there is certainly a real little community of grotesques in the House of Commons. The Sunday Times wrote of the “protection racket” of MPs who propped up Elphicke before he was found guilty and imprisoned, including Holloway, Theresa Villiers, Bob Stewart and Roger Gale. Elphicke’s wife, Natalie, remains an MP in his former seat, despite having only recently signed a witness statement in which she accused one of the victims of his crimes of lying. Still want more? Tory MP David Warburton has just had the whip removed over multiple sexual assault allegations. In December, his ex-colleague and former minister Andrew Griffiths was found by a high court judge to have repeatedly raped and abused his wife. Former Labour member Claudia Webbe remains an MP, despite having been handed a two-year suspended prison sentence for a campaign of harassment against a woman, with the trial hearing this had included the threat of an acid attack. Webbe’s appealing that, so she remains in the Commons. Any others? Hang on – Rob Roberts sits as an independent, despite having been found to have sexually harassed two members of his staff by an independent panel and the Tory party respectively, but was bafflingly given his Conservative membership back. Without wishing to go out on a limb here, this feels like … quite a lot? There are only 650 MPs. Is this a normal distribution of such abysmal and repulsive behaviour? Alas, here we are at the last paragraph, and I note Crispin Blunt still hasn’t been relieved of the whip. But the Metropolitan police has just confirmed it has now made more than 50 – FIFTY! – referrals for fixed-term penalty notices for lawbreaking Downing Street parties during lockdown. And No 10 confirms that two of those are for the actual prime minister and the actual chancellor. Just so endlessly, endlessly impressive. Then again, “most homes” and “most businesses” broke the law in the pandemic. We know this, because it was recently stated as fact by a hugely versatile authority figure. His name? Crispin Blunt.

4/13/2022,"What easy desserts can I make for Easter that don’t contain chocolate?Laura, Oxford It’s all too easy to fall into the trap of thinking Easter desserts are all about chocolate. So you’re right, Laura, to look for something lighter and brighter (citrus! Rhubarb! Meringue!) – after all, it is spring. For baker Flora Shedden, owner of Aran in Highland Perthshire, the simplest solution is affogato. “Really good vanilla, ginger or even coffee ice-cream, espresso [to pour over] and crushed amaretti on top.” She often chills out with semifreddo, too, combining two parts whipped cream with one part condensed milk, meringue and a few shots of espresso. She freezes it in a loaf tin, then serves it in slices. “The condensed milk and meringue stop it from crystallising, so you’ll have a nice ice-cream texture.” And it welcomes adaptations: “It’s tasty with stem ginger syrup and chopped stem ginger, or fold in some fruit – raspberries with vanilla [instead of the coffee] would be nice.” Also scoring highly in the easy stakes is lemon posset, the chilled British classic for which double cream and sugar are heated before adding lemon zest and juice. “It’s super-quick to make and feels quite springy,” says Shedden, who crowns hers with a couple of crumbled ginger nut biscuits: “Happy days.” You can’t go far wrong with a showstopper pavlova, either. “It feels Eastery because it’s eggs,” says pastry chef Anna Higham, whose debut cookbook, The Last Bite, is out next month. “It’s nice that it collapses a bit, so it doesn’t have to look too perfect.” You could, she adds, mix chopped preserved lemon into the thick, glossy meringue before baking until crisp on the outside and mallowy within: “It gives sharpness to balance that crazy sweetness.” Higham tops her pav with lemon curd, whipped cream and “whatever beautiful citrus you can find”. Rhubarb would also work a treat here, Shedden adds. “I like it a little sweeter: a quarter sugar to one part rhubarb, plus a quarter water.” Add stem ginger, if you fancy, then bake until soft and syrupy. Eat with broken-up meringue and cream whipped with yoghurt, so “it’s not too heavy or sweet”. Galettes are easier than, well, pie. Shedden rolls sweet shortcrust pastry into a disc, spoons over some frangipane, then tops with rhubarb, early berries or blood orange. Fold over the pastry edges and bake; a scoop of ice-cream on the side is optional, but encouraged. Trifle is always a good idea, too, and, Higham notes, “easy to take to a big family celebration”. To make things even more festive, swap the sponge base for hot cross buns: “Toast, soak in loads of booze, then make an earl grey jelly and a custard with sultanas mixed through, and top the lot with whipped cream.” Or skip pudding entirely and go straight for the hot cross buns. Few are more proficient in the subject than Helen Evans of Flor in London, which knocked out 7,000 last year. Her secret? Copious fruit and spices (“toast them whole, then grind”), including a little black pepper and cumin. And don’t forget to give those buns a liberal syruping for a taste of the sweet life.

4/13/2022,"A government scheme in Spain that has prisoners make their jailers’ clothes has come apart at the seams after officers complained their uniforms were ill-fitting, uncomfortable, badly made and sometimes covered in stains. The prison workers’ union, part of the general workers’ union, complained that pockets were sewn at different heights and trousers had legs of unequal lengths. “They don’t meet even minimum standards of quality in either material or manufacture,” said Joaquín Leyva, the union’s spokesperson. “The colours run, they are badly sewn and the sizes aren’t correct.” While it is hardly surprising if prisoners show little concern for their jailers’ comfort, Leyva says the problem is the result of incompetence rather than malice. “There’s no evidence that it’s deliberate on the part of the prisoners,” he said. “The problem is there is no quality control. The prisoners have no training and they are paid per item so, obviously, their concern is for quantity, not quality.” Quality control is carried out by the prisoners, Leyva said, adding that they are not under pressure to produce good work as they are not about to lose their jobs. The contract for prisoners to make the uniforms for the country’s 25,000 prison staff was renewed last week. The union is demanding that it be rescinded, saying the prison workshops “are incapable of making uniforms of sufficient quality”. Leyva said the union wanted the work to be done by an external company with proper standards of quality control. According to the union: “The prison community feels discriminated against compared with other groups such as the national police and the civil guard, who have better quality uniforms made by recognised external companies.” The prison officers’ uniforms are made by a state-run company with a view to giving prisoners work experience and a better prospect of re-entering society on their release. The prison workshops organisation says its aim is for “our workshops produce goods of the highest quality”. Despite the union’s complaints, there seems little chance that the production of the uniforms will be outsourced in the near future, as in recent years the government has invested heavily in machinery and training in the eight textile workshops spread across the country’s prisons.",News/World news,Crime of fashion: Spanish jailers object to quality of prisoner‑made uniforms,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/spain-prison-made-uniforms-jail-ugt
4/13/2022,"Civilians have fled eastern Ukraine in advance of a widely forecast attack and Russian forces closed in on the ruins of the southern city of Mariupol, as Vladimir Putin insisted Moscow’s invasion would achieve what he called its “noble” aims. Ukrainian forces were preparing on Tuesday for a new Russian offensive in the east of the country, with the governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Gaidai, urging residents to evacuate as soon as possible using agreed humanitarian corridors. “It’s far more scary to remain and to burn in your sleep from a Russian shell,” Gaidai said on social media. “Evacuate: with every day the situation is getting worse. Take your essential items and head to the pickup point.” Russian troops also continued to pound the Azovstal industrial district of Mariupol where Ukrainian marines were making a last stand in the defence of the strategic port, which has been largely reduced to rubble after six weeks of heavy bombardment. Russia is believed to be trying to seize Mariupol to connect occupied Crimea with theself-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk in the eastern Donbas region, but Kyiv insisted its defence of the city was continuing. “The connection with the units of the defence forces that heroically hold the city is stable and maintained,” Ukraine’s military command said, adding that Russian forces were targeting the town of Popasna, two hours’ drive west of Luhansk, and were also preparing an offensive in the direction of Kurakhove, near Donetsk. The deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar said Kyiv was checking unconfirmed information that Russia may have used chemical weapons in the siege of Mariupol, whose mayor has said more than 10,000 civilians have died. “There is a theory that these could be phosphorus munitions; official information will come later,” Malyar said. Russia’s defence ministry did not respond to requests for comment but Moscow-backed separatist forces denied using chemical weapons. Mariupol city council said the area where the poisonous substance had allegedly been used could not be examined because of enemy fire, adding that Ukrainian soldiers who had come into contact with it were being observed for possible symptoms. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said overnight that Russia could resort to chemical weapons and both the US and the UK said they were trying to verify the reports. Zelenskiy on Tuesday also urged the EU to impose sanctions on all Russian banks and Russian oil, and to set firm deadlines for ending imports of Russian gas. “We cannot wait,” he told the Lithuanian parliament. “We need powerful decisions. Only then will the Russian government understand they need to seek peace, that the war is turning into a catastrophe for them.” While Russian troops have withdrawn from around Ukraine’s capital in the face of stiff resistance and apparent logistical problems, western officials and analysts say the invasion force is gearing up for a major offensive in the east. “Fighting in eastern Ukraine will intensify over the next two to three weeks as Russia continues to refocus its efforts there,” Britain’s defence ministry said. “Russian attacks remain focused near Donetsk and Luhansk with further fighting around Kherson and Mykolaiv and a renewed push toward Kramatorsk.” Visiting the far east of Russia on Tuesday, Putin said the country’s military would “undoubtedly achieve” its goals in Ukraine, saying its objectives were “noble” and the operation was aimed at ensuring Russia’s security. The Russian president said Moscow had no choice but to launch its attack on 24 February. “Its goals are absolutely clear and noble,” Putin said, adding that the main aim was to save people in Russian-controlled Donbas. “On the one hand, we are helping and saving people, and on the other, we are simply taking measures to ensure the security of Russia itself,” Putin said. “It’s clear that we didn’t have a choice. It was the right decision.” Touring the Vostochny cosmodrome 3,450 miles (5,550km) from Moscow with the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, Putin added that attempts to isolate Russia would fail, citing the success of the Soviet space programme during the cold war. “We don’t intend to be isolated,” Putin said. “It is impossible to severely isolate anyone in the modern world – especially such a vast country as Russia.” Belarus has said it has been unfairly labelled “an accomplice of the aggressor” in Ukraine. Russia’s invasion has so far driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes, including more than 4 million who have fled abroad. Russian forces have been accused of multiple atrocities including hundreds of civilian killings. Unprecedented sanctions imposed by the west in response are likely to cause Russia’s economy to contract by more than 10% in 2022, the biggest fall in GDP since the years after following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, a former finance minister, Alexei Kudrin, said on Tuesday.",News/World news,Civilians flee eastern Ukraine ahead of new Russian offensive,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/civilian-flee-eastern-ukraine-ahead-new-russian-offensive
4/13/2022,"Tory MPs have criticised Ben Goldsmith and called for his resignation as chair of the Conservative Environment Network (CEN) and a director at Defra after he voiced support for Extinction Rebellion. The financier and environmentalist, who sits on Defra’s board, has apologised after criticising Labour’s strong stance against the Just Stop Oil protests, during which activists have blockaded fuel distribution terminals. He has said he has no plans to resign. Goldsmith, the brother of the minister and peer Zac, tweeted: “Not a good look from Labour. The protesters are right to be doing whatever it takes to wake people up. The fossil fuel industry is grubby and dangerous. We need to unhook ourselves from our dependence ASAP. I’m with Extinction Rebellion.” The shadow justice secretary, Steve Reed, responded: “This from a Conservative official is an insult to people facing misery trying to get to work. While the government continues to refuse to act, Labour has called for immediate injunctions to put a stop to this disruption.” A Conservative MP called for Goldsmith to step down from his positions at Defra and CEN. Chris Loder, the MP for West Dorset and a member of CEN, said: “Ben Goldsmith is inappropriately interfering in political matters when he is a Defra director, hanging on to his brother’s coattails. He should either resign and stand for election or be sacked.” He threatened to step down himself from CEN, which Goldsmith founded, if the financier was still a member by the end of the day. The Conservative group includes 133 MPs, half of all Tory backbenchers. Loder has previously locked horns with the environmental campaigner after claiming rare white-tailed eagles were not welcome in his constituency, and that the police should prioritise investigating other crimes over wildlife crime. Goldsmith campaigns for the reintroduction of wild species including white-tailed eagles. Others who have criticised Goldsmith’s tweet include Fay Jones, the MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, and the former cabinet minister Damian Green, both on a Conservative WhatsApp group. In an apology message to CEN MPs, Goldsmith said: “This morning I tweeted in a personal capacity my sympathies for the Extinction Rebellion protests. Support of ER is neither a CEN nor a Defra position. I have therefore retracted these tweets. “I recognise the disruption these protests are causing to people’s lives and livelihoods. I’ve always previously stood publicly opposed to the controversial and often bonkers methods employed by ER. That being said, I know I’m not alone in feeling a rising sense of panic as the reported science grows ever grimmer. Awareness and action are not commensurate with the scale of the issue, even if we in the UK are now leading the way globally.” A government source said: “Ben expressed a personal view, not that of the government. People have the right to protest, and the issue of climate change is very important. That’s why we’re taking such ambitious action to tackle it. But these XR protests are not peaceful protests, they are disrupting people’s lives and it is wholly unacceptable. That’s why the government is taking robust action to stop them.”",News/Politics,Tory MPs criticise Ben Goldsmith over praise for Extinction Rebellion ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/12/tory-mps-criticise-ben-goldsmith-extinction-rebellion-just-stop-oil

It’s clear that we didn’t have a choice.

Russia’s defence ministry has not made any comment on the allegations. The pro-Russia separatist forces of the self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk have issued a denial that they have used any chemical agents. Russia’s defence ministry says it has destroyed Ukrainian ammunition depots in the Khmelnytskyi and Kyiv regions. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said nine humanitarian corridors had been agreed to evacuate civilians on Tuesday. That included from Mariupol, although civilians will have to use private cars. More than 10,000 civilians have died in Mariupol, the city’s mayor has said. Vadym Boychenko said the death toll could surpass 20,000, as weeks of attacks and privation had left bodies “carpeted through the streets”.
