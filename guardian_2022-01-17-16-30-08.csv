1/17/2022,"A juvenile humpback whale has been spotted in the Antarctic entangled in fishing gear, leading to calls from conservationists for better protections along migration corridors. The sighting last Wednesday by scientists aboard the Crystal Endeavour occurred at Mikkelsen Harbour on Trinity Island, on the western side of the Antarctic peninsula.  The researchers from the Colombian Antarctic program, PhD candidate Logan Pallin and Dr Natalia Botero-Acosta, approached the small whale to take a skin biopsy to help determine its genetic origin, sex, cortisol levels and diet. Pallin noticed the whale’s dorsal fin was missing, and it was trailing fishing gear and several buoys that had become wrapped around the fluke – the tail – where it was causing abrasions and cutting into the skin. The whale’s age is unknown but it is estimated to be about 18 months. As it was likely on its first migration alone, it had likely carried the gear over thousands of kilometres down the South American coast. It was last seen labouring to swim and is considered unlikely to survive. With humpback whale numbers now rebounding after being decimated by whaling, and climate change affecting the availability of food, the animals are increasingly moving through areas with higher levels of human activity. Simon Miller, an Australian Marine Conservation Society fisheries expert said it was difficult to tell what sort of net had entangled the whale and whether it was active or a “ghost net” that had been abandoned, broken or cut loose. “If they become wrapped up in a net like this juvenile, they are effectively dragging an anchor behind them which spells an untimely end unless they are freed,” Miller said. While it is possible to cut away the fishing gear, the process requires specialised equipment and trained teams as the manoeuvre is dangerous for both those carrying out the task and the whale. These are generally unavailable in the Antarctic. A report of the entanglement was circulated to other vessels in the area in an effort to monitor the whale, but Prof Ari Friedlaender of University of California Santa Cruz’s ocean sciences department said more needed to be done to stop a repeat in the future. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “My hope is that the more this type of situation is brought to light, the more can be done to minimise these interactions from happening,” he said. “Because nobody wants to see whales harmed like this, nobody wants to see people who fish have their livelihood dragged away as well.” Friedlaender said entanglements can be reduced with modifications to fishing gear to make it less likely to become caught, tangled and dragged and more information for fishers to better time operations. Miller said the incident shows the “vast reach impacts like fishing can have on threatened species”. “Whale entanglement can be avoided to an extent by not setting high risk fishing gear like lobster pots with long head ropes or gillnets in the areas through which humpbacks are known to migrate and congregate,” Miller said. “As humpback migration patterns and timings are regular, fishers should know where and when not to set their nets.”",News/Environment,Entangled humpback whale’s sad fate has researchers calling for action on fishing nets,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/17/entangled-humpback-whales-sad-fate-has-researchers-calling-for-action-on-fishing-nets
1/17/2022,"Human rights advocates have criticised the prime minister, Scott Morrison, after he wrongly claimed those held in detention in Australia for as long as eight years had not been recognised as refugees. Australia’s harsh border policies have been thrust into the spotlight since the detention of tennis star Novak Djokovic at the notorious Park hotel in Melbourne, where dozens of asylum seekers and refugees are detained indefinitely.  Guardian Australia understands that there are 25 refugees and seven asylum seekers currently held in the Park hotel. Speaking to 2GB radio on Monday, Morrison was asked by presenter Ben Fordham how it was “acceptable” that refugees in the same hotel as Djokovic had been detained for almost nine years with taxpayers spending millions of dollars “to keep them in limbo.” In response, Morrison suggested the detainees were not refugees. “Well, the specific cases, Ben, I mean, it’s not clear that to my information that someone in that case is actually a refugee,” he said. “They may have sought asylum and been found not to be a refugee and have chosen not to return, and … that happens in this country, people aren’t found to be refugees and they won’t return.” But Elaine Pearson, the Australia director of Human Rights Watch, told the Guardian that most of those held in the Park hotel had been granted refugee status. “It’s an outright lie to say that these people are not refugees, when most of them have had their refugee status formally recognised for years,” Pearson said. “They’ve been through that process and it is established that they simply can’t return to their country.” “To somehow claim they are waiting around because they should be going home is absolutely inaccurate. And it is grossly misleading for our prime minister, who used to be the immigration minister, to be spreading this misinformation.” Pearson said Australia had a long track record of trying to cast doubt on the claims of people who seek asylum. “If you look at who’s being detained, it is men who have been shunted from one centre to another, in Australia or offshore, for more than eight years. At what point in time do you say they have suffered enough? They can’t simply continue to be used, for the rest of their lives, as a symbol of deterrence. They need to be allowed to move on with their lives.” Mehdi, a refugee held in the Park hotel who fled Iran as a child, aged 15, arrived in Australia by boat in 2013. He has marked nine birthdays since, either in immigration detention in Australia or held in offshore processing centres. His claim to refugee status was formally recognised by the Australian government in 2014. Mehdi – he only uses one name – has a “well-founded fear of being persecuted” in Iran, and he cannot legally be returned there. “I am a refugee. If I wasn’t, why would I endure such a difficult time as a child if I have the option to go back to where I came from?” Mehdi told Guardian Australia. Mehdi said he is still not safe in detention. Australia’s Nauru offshore processing centre, the government’s own reports reveal, was plagued by child physical and sexual abuse, violence and mental health trauma. The hotel where he is currently detained has been at the centre of repeated Covid-19 outbreaks. “The government’s treatment of detained children is not in line with Australian domestic law. Children may only be detained for the shortest appropriate time, and we were innocent children who were intentionally exposed to horrible experiences. “Depriving me of education, both when I was 15 and now, reflects a discriminatory attitude, because education is a right that must be upheld under the International Declaration of Human Rights. I received minimal education in a world where knowledge comes first, an obvious right for children.” Nina Field, a detention advocacy caseworker with the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said those detained in the Park hotel had been held against their will by the Australian government for nearly nine years. “The people held in Park hotel are almost all refugees. They were brought to Australia from offshore detention in Nauru or [Papua New Guinea] for medical treatment – which for the most part they have not received. Instead, they have been left to suffer in limbo in detention centres and airless hotel rooms for more than two years. In these places, they sometimes have to wait for hours just to get a Panadol. “Now, the prime minister appears to be further demonising them by suggesting that they have somehow ‘failed’ in their refugee claims and are ‘choosing’ not to return. They have no such choice.” When asked about Labor’s position on those held in detention, Labor’s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, said the party supported them being held in community detention while their cases were finalised. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Labor has been saying for months now, that if these refugees are able to live in the community they should do so,” Keneally said. “In fact, we agreed with Peter Dutton, when he said it was more cost-effective to have these people living in the community while the outcome of their cases are determined. It is really now up to Karen Andrews to explain why that’s not happening.” The prime minister’s office was contacted for comment.",News/Australia news,PM accused of ‘outright lie’ after claiming detainees in Melbourne hotel are not refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/17/pm-accused-of-outright-lie-after-claiming-detainees-in-melbourne-hotel-are-not-refugees
1/17/2022,"It is essential to check what will happen if you need to cancel transport or accommodation, whether you are booking the different elements yourself or opting for a package. Many may offer free cancellation but read the small print carefully – there will be a deadline for this, and it could be several weeks before your holiday is set to start.  Read flexible policies carefully. Qin Xie from Hey Money Talk says flexible booking should mean not paying an admin fee or losing your deposit if plans change. “What’s included in flexible booking obviously depends on who you book with but amends are usually for travel dates and/or destinations.” If you are booking a holiday let only, book through a third-party site that has has a clear refund policy and which takes secure payments by credit card. Your contract is always with the company or person to which you paid the money. For example, if you book through Airbnb you need to contact the company for a refund, whereas with Vrbo you would need to contact the property owner. Tracey McLaughlin, a blogger at Mind Over Money Matters, is a member of the Air Miles scheme and has beenusing it to book her holidays – it offers more flexibility than paying for the flights with a credit card, she says. “Air Miles gives us the option to cancel our booking 24 hours before travel for only a £35 charge,” she says. “All accommodation, etc is also booked with free cancellation up to 24 hours before.” Put your holiday on a credit card, if possible – under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act this gives you protection on purchases of more than £100, and will cover your costs if a holiday firm you have booked with goes bust. To benefit from the cover make sure that you book and pay directly with the holiday company, rather than using a third-party payment company such as PayPal. The Atol (Air Travel Organisers’ Licence) financial protection scheme covers flight-based holidays and is operated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Under the scheme, if your travel company fails you will be entitled to a refund or replacement holiday if you are yet to travel, or provided with accommodation and flights home if you are abroad. Flights booked directly with airlines are not protected under the Atol scheme. Keep the certificate you are given when booking safe. If you buy a coach, rail or cruise holiday from an Abta member your money will be protected by the association’s financial protection scheme. If your travel company fails and your holiday can no longer go ahead, you will be entitled to a refund if you are yet to travel or hotel costs and transport home if you are abroad. Travel agents have access to the latest up-to-date information, airline and holiday offers and are very knowledgable about amending holidays and alternative destinations, giving you extra peace of mind. It can be cheaper to buy a flight and accommodation separately. However, if you book a package you have more protection from the Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations 2018. The travel organiser or operator must inform you of any alterations to the package clearly and without undue delay. You then have the option to cancel with no penalty if the holiday changes significantly. Linda Reynolds of Personal Travel Agent says: “DIY holidays can be problematic at this time. I’ve heard of people turning up at hotels in Canada and the hotel was shut and locally there were no alternatives in their price range. Check your hotel is open. A quick look on their website or email to confirm your arrival should help.” You should always take out insurance at the time of making your booking. Check with the supplier that it covers your needs – if you know you want to go jetskiing, for example, does it include it? Make sure you look for details of Covid cancellation, medical fees and repatriation. Check the quarantine rules for the country you are travelling to – some, for example, will make you move hotel if you test positive. Ask your insurer what it will pay for if you have to extend your stay because you are quarantined and unable to travel hoe. If you are due to travel after your annual insurance expires, make sure you renew it before you travel. If the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) puts a warning in place for your destination during any gap in your policy, you won’t be covered. Regularly check the FCDO website for entry requirements to the country you plan to visit, and keep an eye on the UK entry requirements. The government website will state which Covid test is required and the timescales before leaving and returning. Emma Savage of Travel Counsellors emphasises the importance of complying with the entry requirements of your destination. “They all vary, so make sure you/your agent is fully briefed on what you need to do” The FCDO continuously reviews its travel advice for each country or territory to ensure it includes up-to-date information and advice on the most relevant issues for British people visiting or living there. You can also sign up for email alerts to get updates as they happen. When the time comes round for your break, make sure you have booked any Covid tests that you need – and shop around before you do. Rory Boland, the travel editor of Which?, said “The Covid testing system for travel has been operating for a year now, and travellers are still being exposed to providers that fail to deliver tests on time or advertise prices that are not available.” Check reviews on sites such as Trustpilot, or try the comparison website Covid19-testing.org. Reynolds advises that you make physical copies of everything. “As well as your booking documents, print a copy of health forms, attestation if applicable, passenger locator form and confirmed test results,” she says. Don’t rely on the airport’s wifi to download your vital documents.",Lifestyle/Money,How to book a holiday during the Covid pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/17/how-to-book-a-holiday-during-the-covid-pandemic
1/17/2022,"It’s a cold winter’s day, and I’m standing in a room watching my dog stare fixedly at two flower pots. I’m about to get an answer to a burning question: is my puppy a clever girl? Dogs have been our companions for millennia, domesticated sometime between 15,000 and 30,000 years ago. And the bond endures: according to the latest figures from the Pet Food Manufacturers Association 33% of households in the UK have a dog.  But as well as fulfilling roles from Covid detection to lovable family rogue, scientists investigating how dogs think, express themselves and communicate with humans say dogs can also teach us about ourselves. And so I am here at the dog cognition centre at the University of Portsmouth with Calisto, the flat-coated retriever, and a pocket full of frankfurter sausage to find out how. We begin with a task superficially reminiscent of the cup and ballgame favoured by small-time conmen. Amy West, a PhD student at the centre, places two flower pots a few metres in front of Calisto, and appears to pop something under each. However, only one actually contains a tasty morsel. West points at the pot under which the sausage lurks, and I drop Calisto’s lead. The puppy makes a beeline for the correct pot. But according to Dr Juliane Kaminski, reader in comparative psychology at the University of Portsmouth, this was not unexpected. “A chimpanzee is our closest living relative – they ignore gestures like these coming from humans entirely,” she says. “But dogs don’t.” That appears to be the result of domestication, she adds, with puppies even younger than Calisto showing the same response, yet wolves do not – even if they have been raised by humans. “Dogs have been selected to pay attention to our gesturing, information that is coming from us,” she says. A key question, Kaminski added, is whether dogs and children understand gestures in the same way. “That in some sense also helps us understand our own species a bit better,” she says, adding the comparison to other animals – and in particular dogs – can help shed light on which aspects are unique about human communication. In the next experiment Calisto watches as West places cheese under one pot, and reveals the other is empty. West then swaps the pots around. The experiment investigates whether dogs understand the idea of “object permanence” – the realisation that, in this case, the treat has moved with the flower pot. “We’ve done this with dogs, in quite a large group of dogs, and they struggle,” says Kaminski. Calisto, however, picks the correct pot on three out of four attempts. Kaminski is cautious. Perhaps, she says, Calisto was a bit too close to the pots and could smell the treat. While many dogs find the experiment tough, that too has yielded insights. Some of Kaminksi’s most famous work was with Rico the border collie, a dog with an incredible ability to learn the names of items. “I found him on German TV, basically,” she says. At first Kaminski thought Rico was picking correct objects based on cues from humans – similar to the case of “Clever Hans”, a horse who appeared to have incredible intelligence. But Kaminski’s work revealed Rico really was using the spoken word to select specific objects: he learned the labels of more than 200 items. And he wasn’t the only dog with the ability, as a number of research teams have shown with various breeds. Kaminski and colleagues are now looking to find other such canines, having recently launched a project called “Finding Rico”. “I don’t expect us to find more than 50 dogs worldwide that that can do this,” Kaminski says. But while Rico was smart at learning labels, Kaminski notes he struggled with the idea of object permanence. Cleverness in canines, it seems, is complex. “It is not that we are thinking that we have like an Einstein dog in front of us that knows everything,” said Kaminski. “We think we have dogs that have a special skill or a special set of skills that enables them to be very good at learning labels.” Calisto’s skill appears to be pulling the puppy dog eyes. But maybe that’s not surprising – Kaminski’s work has also revealed dogs produce more facial expressions when someone is looking at them, in particular raising their eyebrows which makes their eyes look bigger. Is it a deliberate ploy? “I think that they have some voluntary control over that,” says Kaminski. “But I don’t think that they have learned to sort of modify their face in a particular way to kind of get a specific reaction from their owner.” Kaminski says the eyebrow movement could be something that humans unconsciously selected for, perhaps because it makes dogs look like infants. Among other research, she and her team are probing the matter, including whether the movement has particular meaning for dogs. Has Kaminski’s work has changed her view of canine intelligence? She points out while some say dogs are as intelligent as a two-year-old child, others take the opposing stance, suggesting dogs are unable to think flexibly. “It’s just confirmed, I guess, over and over is that the truth is somewhere in the middle,” says Kaminski. “And we are still at the very beginning of understanding what they really understand.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Who’s a clever dog?

1/17/2022,"Leaders in the US have struck a pessimistic tone about the Covid-19 pandemic in recent weeks amid rapid spread of the Omicron variant. Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, recently testified before Congress that “most people are going to get Covid”. Dr Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to Joe Biden, has also said that Omicron “​​will ultimately find just about everybody” in terms of exposure, though vaccines make an important difference in who develops the illness.  But Covid-19 is still a very serious disease with unknown outcomes, even for the less severe Omicron variant. Here top experts break down exactly why people should still try to avoid getting Covid-19 – especially in the next few weeks and months, as hospitals see unprecedented strain and effective early treatments are appearing on the horizon. Am I just going to get Covid no matter what I do? “That’s not true,” said Paul Offit, a professor of pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “I don’t plan on getting infected with Omicron. I’m vaccinated; because I’m over 65, I’m boosted. I wear a mask whenever I’m in public and indoors around people I don’t know. And I have no intentions of being infected with this virus.” While the more transmissible Omicron variant is infecting more people than ever before, taking proven precautions can still prevent it: getting vaccinated and boosted, wearing high-quality masks, improving ventilation and avoiding crowds indoors. Should I just get it and get it over with? Planning to get Omicron in order to gain some immunity or get it over with is a terrible idea, said Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research. “This is a real-deal virus where there’s unpredictability,” he said. “Some people can get very sick. Some people can get long Covid. Some people unwittingly will then get immunocompromised people sick”, leading to hospitalization and death. He added: “There’s too many liabilities, too many uncertainties and unpredictabilities when you get a virus with this known profile that can be very severe and lethal still.” And it’s not at all clear if recovering from Omicron would protect against future variants. If you’ve already gotten Omicron, it may have broadened your T-cell recognition and your B-cell memory and given you “a nice jolt of neutralizing antibodies”, Topol said. But “you can’t possibly make that assertion that Omicron will protect from the future”. But isn’t Omicron mild? Definitely not a guarantee. It is still a deadly illness. Omicon is less severe than Delta – but Delta was itself more severe than previous variants. “It can still be severe,” Topol said. He calls it less severe, not milder. “‘Milder’ caught on early, and I think it’s unfortunate it’s given this impression, because there’s so many people dying and winding up in the ICU.” In animal studies, Omicron was less effective than Delta at infecting lung tissue, making severe pneumonia less likely. And according to a new preprint study, which has not been published or peer reviewed, illness was shorter and hospitalizations were half as likely among those with Omicron versus Delta. But a lowered risk of getting very ill doesn’t mean no risk, Offit said. “You still could have all of those things happen to you – you still could be hospitalized, go to the ICU, require mechanical ventilation and die.” Is that why some people are still being hospitalized? The US has record-high hospitalizations, and cases are more than three times higher than our previous highest peak, a year ago. That’s because the other characteristics of Omicron – its immune-evasiveness and transmissibility – more than outweigh its relatively less severe symptoms. When more people get sick, there are more chances of the illness going very wrong. “A small percentage of a huge number is a very large number,” said Jorge Moreno, assistant professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine. Jerome Adams, the former US surgeon general, laid out the math: “If your enemy uses a weapon that’s one-third as likely to kill you, but four times as many people are shooting at you, you’re now 1.3 times as likely to die!” What about this idea of being hospitalized “for” versus “with” Covid? “I think that’s grossly inaccurate,” Topol said. He recently cared for a Covid-positive patient with chronic lung disease who was coded as hospitalized “with”, not “for,” Covid. That’s because the patient needed to be treated for the lung disease – but it had only flared up because of Covid. “We do have 150,000 US hospitalizations with or for Covid, which is well beyond any record and is completely overwhelming health systems,” Topol said. “So, this debate is just nonsensical.” There are cases where patients are undergoing surgery or getting treated for accidents when they test positive for Covid incidentally. But that’s not very common, experts said. It’s far more likely that Covid exacerbates another condition or causes a different illness to rise to the forefront: complications from diabetes, renal failure, strokes, heart inflammation or failure, asthma, emphysema, pulmonary embolisms. Does that mean the types of complications caused by Covid are changing? “This virus does things no other respiratory virus does,” Offit said. “You can have strokes, heart attacks, kidney disease, liver disease, and then whatever long Covid is.” Previous variants also created these types of complications. The difference with Omicron is, you might not need to be ventilated – but you’ll still need to be hospitalized, sometimes in the intensive care unit. “It may be causing a milder pulmonary problem, but it’s definitely still causing other problems,” Moreno said. “They may not require intubation; they may still require the ICU.” One major complication from Covid has been diabetic ketoacidosis. “It raises their blood sugars; it creates conditions that are more threatening for patients with diabetes,” Moreno said. “Those are very urgent and sometimes life-threatening conditions. They still require a lot of care. They still require a lot of time in the hospital.” What’s Omicron doing to hospitals? “The end result is our hospitals are filling up,” Topol said. “And it’s breaking the backs of the healthcare system, particularly the healthcare workforce.” Across the country, hospitals are nearing or passing capacity. On Thursday, Joe Biden promised to send the military to six states where hospitals are overwhelmed. There were already staff shortages due to death, disability, and the emotional burdens of the pandemic. Now, more health workers are out sick with Omicron. “On top of that, we are adding the fact that the US is not closed. Back in March of 2020, everything was closed,” Moreno said. That meant there were fewer accidents happening and fewer infectious diseases spreading. “Last year, there was no flu, there was no RSV,” Offit said. “What we did by not just masking and social distancing, but by closing schools, closing businesses, restricting travel – we dramatically reduced the incidence of those diseases.” Now, hospitals are facing Covid plus other health emergencies, Moreno said. “It’s a perfect storm.” Do vaccines still help against Omicron? Absolutely. Unvaccinated people in particular are still at risk for pneumonia and other complications, and vaccinations can dramatically lower those risks. “If you’re unvaccinated, you will have a longer illness, you will get sicker most likely,” Moreno said. “There is some evidence that it’s not targeting the lungs as much – however, one thing with Covid is that it can do whatever it wants, right? So once it finds the host, once it gets in, it’s unpredictable.” But vaccination, he said, “makes Covid predictable”. “You never ever want to get a viral infection,” Offit said. “But the good news is, you don’t have to. You can vaccinate yourself so you can experience the immunity induced by natural infection without having to pay the price of natural infection.” Sometimes it feels like each wave will last for ever. But are things getting better? “I do think that we are on the verge of getting past at least the bulk of Omicron,” Offit said. “You will start to see a decline.” And new treatments that are very effective at keeping Covid from getting serious are on their way. It takes time to manufacture them, but within months, the US should have millions of doses – which means getting infected with Covid in a few months could be much less risky with more tools to battle it.",News/World news,‘I have no intention of getting infected’: understanding Omicron’s severity,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/16/no-intention-of-getting-infected-understanding-omicrons-severity
1/17/2022,"It seemed that Joe Biden would be bad for business in “Make America great again” world. In theory, the US president, a white man with working-class roots and moderate policy positions, was a more elusive target for Donald Trump’s increasingly extreme support base than other prominent Democrats.  But after his first year in office, it transpires that Biden is not too boring to be a rightwing boogeyman after all. “He’s our best salesperson,” said Ronald Solomon, a merchandiser who sells a $21.99 T-shirt depicting the president with an Adolf Hitler-style mustache and the slogan “Not My Dictator”. “Sales for Trump stuff and anti-Biden merchandise is the highest it’s been except for the three months leading up to the 2020 election.” The demonization of Biden as a Hitler, Stalin or anti-white racist bears no relation to reality. But for many Republican voters it appears to stick, the product of relentless conservative media attacks, the president’s own missteps, and seething frustration during a seemingly never-ending pandemic. At first Biden did excite less animus than Barack Obama, the first Black president who was subjected to conspiracy theories about his birthplace and the rise of the populist Tea Party movement. Biden never had to go through the misogyny endured by Hillary Clinton. His policy record was also non-incendiary. When Trump supporters gathered at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference under the banner “America vs socialism”, the biggest hate figures were Senator Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist from Vermont, and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a liberal Latina from New York. Since moving into the White House, however, Biden has granted Sanders a prominent voice in shaping his policy agenda. The unexpected scale of the president’s ambition to spend trillions of dollars on coronavirus relief, the social safety net and the climate crisis has fed into a Republican narrative that he is a puppet of the radical left. And although Biden’s identity as a white man neutralised other “isms”, he cannot escape ageism. At 79, he is the oldest American president in history, his every verbal slip seized upon as cause to doubt his mental fitness. Last May, Fox News host Sean Hannity displayed a sippy cup with the presidential seal on it, floating the nickname “Sippy Cup Joe”. In August, Tucker Carlson told viewers of the same network: “Maybe the most important thing we’ve learned is that Joe Biden is not capable of running the country. Joe Biden is senile.” (Such commentators rarely note that Mitch McConnell, Republican minority leader in the Senate, is also 79.) Another popular line of attack is to compare Biden to Jimmy Carter, whose presidency in the 1970s ended in failure after one term. “Joe Biden Is Jimmy Carter 2.0,” said one such press release from the Republican National Committee. “On Joe Biden’s watch, America is grappling with a gas crisis, record-breaking inflation, weak leadership abroad, and Americans trapped behind enemy lines, all reminiscent of the Jimmy Carter years.” But there is no greater symbol of anti-Biden sentiment than “Let’s go Brandon”, a phrase that originated at a Nascar race in Alabama in October. Brandon Brown, a 28-year-old driver, had won his first Xfinity Series and was being interviewed by an NBC Sports reporter. The crowd behind him was chanting something that at first was hard to hear. The reporter suggested they were saying “Let’s go, Brandon!” to support the driver. But it became increasingly clear they were chanting, “Fuck Joe Biden!” So it was that “Let’s go, Brandon” became conservative code for insulting the president and went viral. On a Southwest flight from Houston to Albuquerque, the pilot signed off his greeting over the public address system with the phrase, leaving some passengers aghast. On Christmas Eve, when Biden fielded a few phone calls to the Norad Santa Tracker, Jared Schmeck, a Trump supporter from Oregon, said: “Merry Christmas and let’s go, Brandon!” Speaking from Las Vegas, Solomon, president of the Maga Mall, said he has a line of “Let’s go, Brandon” merchandise including banners, buttons, T-shirts for men and women and hats in four different colors. “One, it’s an attack on the mainstream media: this gal from NBC Sports immediately tried to make it like they were saying something that they weren’t,” he explained. “Two, it’s a way for Republicans that don’t want to use a four-letter word to have a chance to say something that attacks the president of the United States, who they can’t stand any more.” In a nod to the Trump base, Republican senator Ted Cruz posed with a “Let’s go, Brandon” sign at baseball’s World Series. McConnell’s press secretary retweeted a photo of the phrase on a construction sign in Virginia. Congressman Jeff Duncan of South Carolina wore a “Let’s go, Brandon” face mask at the US Capitol. Jim Lamon, a Senate candidate from Arizona, used the slogan a TV campaign ad. Critics point out that goading, provoking and outraging their opponents, known as “owning the libs”, has become the defining principle of a Republican party that lacks a coherent ideology of its own. McConnell reportedly told donors last month that he would not be putting forward a legislative agenda for November’s midterm elections because he was content to merely hammer away at Democrats. But with Biden’s approval rating hovering in the low 40s, and his Build Back Better agenda stalled in Congress, the Republican formula might be working. John Zogby, a pollster and author, said: “They have made significant inroads into demonizing him. In the beginning, of course, it was hard. He was a softer target, he was Uncle Joe, he had a high favorability rating and he’d been around a long time. “But definitely in the second half of this first year, the almost-mantras of the Republican party have gained hold: he’s too old, he’s a socialist, and then this whole ‘Let’s go, Brandon’ thing. Plus the fact that they’ve been able to successfully block the bigger initiatives so not only a socialist, but a socialist who can’t succeed, is the message.” Barbs and brickbats aimed at a Democratic president are hardly new. Before Obama there was Bill Clinton, who drew his share of rancor, vitriol and baseless conspiracy theories. In today’s hyper-polarized Washington, inflamed by social media, the incumbent can expect to have everything but the kitchen sink thrown at them. Allan Lichtman, a distinguished history professor at American University in Washington, said: “As long as you have the capital D as your political designation, you are a target for the Republicans. It doesn’t matter if you are a leftwing or moderate Democrat – it makes absolutely no difference. “Bill Clinton was a centrist. He was the head of the Democratic Leadership Council, dedicated to moving the Democrats to the centre, and yet they relentlessly attacked him, even impeached him. Republicans will oppose essentially anything that a Democratic president proposes and relentlessly attack them.” Others argue that Biden has done Republicans’ work for them with a botched Afghanistan withdrawal, a crisis at the southern border, the highest inflation for 40 years and an inability to curb the pandemic. The president’s newly aggressive stance on voting rights and safeguarding democracy has also rallied Republicans against him. Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster and strategist, said: “Incredibly, Joe Biden has a worse approval rating at this point than Donald Trump did and it’s not because of Republican critiques. It’s because of Biden’s failures. “He’s failed to communicate effectively. He’s failed to try to bridge the gap; in fact, he’s been promoting greater division.

1/17/2022,"The author Zora Neale Hurston once joked: “I am the only negro in the United States whose grandfather on the mother’s side was not an Indian chief.” In part, Hurston was alluding to the embarrassment some African Americans felt about their “debased” African lineage, a notion that lies at the core of the poet Honorée Fanonne Jeffers’s ambitious debut novel. Epigraphic reflections on race by WEB Du Bois, a founding father in 1909 of the interracial National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), who proposed that a “talented tenth” (an elite 10% of the African American population) would transform black people’s lowly standing, hover over chapters of the novel. Its breezy yet detailed 800 pages flit between a fable-like backstory of enslaved Africans who forged liaisons with Creek Native Americans (both brutalised by European traders) and a tragic, contemporary family saga of descendants of the enslaved.  Originating from Chicasetta, a fictitious town in Georgia, the Garfields are the book’s focus. The protagonist, Ailey Pearl Garfield, daughter of light-skinned parents who describes herself as a “gourd filled with secrets”, narrates as a reserved, watchful guide. On entering puberty, she becomes increasingly conscious of the family’s pretensions and hypocrisy, as well as her sexual abuse by a relative. Ailey’s branch of the Garfields, numbered among the black Americans who migrated from southern states to Washington DC, are riven with societal anxiety over maintaining their middle-class status. Chief among them is the fragrant, white cotton glove-wearing matriarch Nana, whose aroma “took you to a better place in the world” than that of the southern relatives who “ate pig offal and covered their living room furniture in plastic”. No matter their elevation, there’s still the tug of inherited shame, a condition psychologists have termed “post-traumatic slavery syndrome”. The Garfields, though, are not minded to reflect on bewildering accounts that their ancestors were betrayed by signares – women of European and African blood who sold them into bondage. The novel’s quiet tone mirrors the pared-back language of enslaved women such as Beauty, whose response to ritualistic humiliation is to make “a bare spot in her mind [which] she crawled into”. Ailey may yearn to crawl out of the darkness of buried family secrets, but she’s determined to at least acknowledge the uncomfortable past. Emotionally and spiritually, she’s closer to her southern relatives. This novel’s spiritual heart is also found in the languorous south, the location of African Americans’ unshowy resistance to racism, most evident in Ailey’s Uncle Root. The retired, pioneering schoolteacher moves to the segregated “silk stocking district” to live among white families, who welcome him with a bucket of spoiled fried chicken and an overripe watermelon left on his doorstep. His defiant answer to the bigots is to eat the watermelon with relish. Uncle Root’s mischief gives a welcome boost to an otherwise sober novel, fuelling the sputtering engine of humour that intermittently powers the book. At one point, Uncle Root recalls a pilgrimage in his youth to meet Du Bois, when the great scholar visited Atlanta. Du Bois, whose lifelong work was a demand for black people to be shown respect, closes the door in his young admirer’s face. What are we to make of this slight? It’s surely a glimpse of the loathing that only kith can feel for kin, echoed in the tensions between those members of the Garfield clan deemed to have failed or succeeded in life. Throughout the early 1900s, African Americans lived in awe of Du Bois, a proselytiser of black intellectual advancement through the arts and books especially, as a strategy for achieving what the historian David Levering Lewis has called “civil rights by copyright”. In a sense, Jeffers is in dialogue with Du Bois about the wisdom of downtrodden people constantly striving for perfection. Ailey’s two sisters illustrate this conundrum: one, carrying on the family tradition, is a dispassionate Ivy League-educated doctor, the other is a perilous junkie. Eyeing her sisters, Ailey comes to believe that maybe ordinariness is good enough. Jeffers captures the compromises and delusions of the “talented tenth”. Their lives, though, have been rendered regularly by equally able authors. Less well known are the stories of Afro-indigenous people and the inner lives of the enslaved that Jeffers tenderly evokes. In doing so, she chimes with Ailey’s ancestor, who aims “to praise the blood that calls out in dreams, long after the memory has surrendered”.

A more sensible way of going about things would be first to establish whether your parents want to give you or sell you the cottage. If they don’t, it doesn’t make much sense to renovate it, especially if you have to take out a personal loan to pay for the work as they are much more expensive than mortgages.  If your parents do want you to have the cottage, you would be able to take out a mortgage on it.

1/17/2022,"I live in London and rely on the public network to charge up my electric car, a Renault Zoe. A few years ago, Lidl introduced rapid chargers, which was great, and I started using its stores, leaving my car on charge while I shopped. On a Sunday in late October, I needed to charge my vehicle, and, as all units around me were in use, I drove to the Lewisham Lidl I normally use. I arrived at 8am, charged the car for an hour, paid, and left just after 9am. The store was closed at the time.  A few weeks later I received a £90 demand for failing to register my number plate (in that closed store), reduced to £45 for prompt payment. The rationale was that I was using the car park outside store operating hours, and that I was not a customer, despite the fact that I had paid the £10 cost to charge my car. I imagined it was a mistake but the parking company, Parking Eye, refused to void it. I was told I could appeal but that I would lose. There were no signs on the charger warning drivers that they would be fined if they used it outside the store’s opening hours. I have wasted a huge amount of time over this crazy situation. TG, London Lidl has won praise for its network of fast EV chargers, but has clearly had a bit of a short-circuit when it comes to its parking policy. Lidl tells me that the store in question offers 90 minutes’ free parking, but requires customers to validate their car registration number inside the shop to, in effect, show they are using the store. It says the same rules apply to those using the rapid chargers, whether the stores are open or not – hence the ticket. Lidl has agreed to waive the charge, and conceded that the matter needs to be addressed. “Our teams are looking into this to prevent it happening again,” it says. It’s absurd it wasn’t waived after you showed proof you’d been using the charger, but that’s the crazy parking world the UK has become. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

For those of us drawn to their sparkle, the good news is they’re not just for Christmas. These cities, gardens and resorts are hosting illuminated trails and festivals of light in January, February and March. Book ahead, and wrap up warm.  During the biennial Love Light festival in Norwich, the city’s landmarks become artworks. Cupid is projected onto the castle and psychedelic neon swirls across the western front of the cathedral. There’s after-dark bicycle ballet and a sound-and-light sculpture in Chapelfield Gardens, a heart-shaped mirror ball in the Forum and light graffiti scribbles across flinty medieval walls. The streets are alive with parades and performances on the suitably pandemic-defying theme of love and belonging.

1/17/2022,"After nearly two years on the Covid frontline, there is one image that haunts Prof Mohammed Munavvar. It is of a visit to Preston cemetery, where a friend had been laid to rest. There he saw a pristine row of gravestones, each planted in the last year. They were all his patients. He knew every single name: “That was terrible, really. It was very traumatic. Even now I think about that image.”  Munavvar is a senior respiratory consultant at the Royal Preston hospital in Lancashire. He and his colleagues have treated nearly 5,000 coronavirus patients since 14 March 2020. The vast majority have survived but many have not. The hospital recorded its 904th coronavirus death overnight last week. While ministers talk of encouraging signs that the Omicron wave may be receding in parts of England, staff at the Royal Preston are struggling to keep their heads above water. The hospital has seen a near four-fold increase in Covid patients since Christmas Day, rising to 103 when the Guardian visited last week. It is one of the largest hospitals in a region with the highest infection levels in the UK and two neighbouring NHS Trusts have declared critical incidents. Despite a recent slowdown in admissions, the “horrendous” levels of staff absence means the pressure is ratcheting up. “Staffing has become more of an issue this wave than it has previously,” said Dr Shondipon Laha, a consultant on the critical care ward. “Almost every day we’re struggling to make sure that staffing is provided adequately. And because our staff are incredibly conscientious, they are doing it. But you do wonder how long they can keep doing it for.” A Nightingale field hospital is being erected in the Royal Preston car park in a sign of what is to come. One of only eight in England, the 100-bed facility will cater to the whole north-west of England and is expected to be full within weeks. The hospital’s restaurant and two sports halls are being readied as an emergency back-up. “It does kick you in the stomach,” said Kelly Fielding, the Covid ward matron, as trolleys of lasagne, sandwiches and fruit are wheeled to the beds of its 34 patients. “You think: ‘Here we go again.’ My main fear as a manager was how are staff going to feel about it. Psychologically, are they prepared for another wave?” A physician of 30 years’ experience, Munavvar said he and his colleagues felt like “sheep being dragged to the slaughterhouse” in the first year of the pandemic, when they were surrounded by the disease every day without the protection of the vaccine. A lasting memory is of going into work each day with a “hollow feeling that, at any time, any of us could die”, he said. Taking shallow breaths behind his oxygen mask, Brian Swindlehurst, 75, said he had “done everything right” in trying to avoid Omicron. He wore masks in public, stayed home where possible, received the vaccine at the first opportunity. Yet Covid caught up with him in the new year, before he was able to get a booster jab due to being on medication for another condition. Swindlehurst will stay on ward 23 for several more nights before he can return home to Christine, his wife of 54 years. A whiteboard beside his bed gives a positive two-word prognosis: “Getting better.” That is thanks to the vaccine, he says: “It could have been a different story. It saves your life.” Nearly half of the Royal Preston’s 103 Covid patients are either unvaccinated or of unknown status – the latter usually those who are too ill to ask. About 30% are double-jabbed and 20% have had a booster jab. On the critical care ward, five of the six coronavirus patients have not had a vaccine. Behind soundproof glass that dulls the whirr and beeps of life-saving machinery, a man in his thirties is hooked up to a ventilator, his left leg hanging limply from the side of his bed. He had not been vaccinated. “The ones who are not vaccinated are the ones who are getting extremely ill,” said Munavvar. The success of the vaccination programme is clear in the numbers: at the height of the first wave, there were about 60 patients in the Royal Preston’s critical care unit and only the lucky made it out. Today there are six, in addition to several more recovering long-term from Covid. Most unvaccinated patients are not “anti-vaxxer” conspiracy theorists, doctors say. They are either younger people who did not expect to get seriously ill, or those who say they simply have not got around to it. “It stresses and it saddens a lot of the staff because it’s frustrating,” said Dr Laha, an executive on the national Intensive Care Society. The outcome for unvaccinated people who end up in critical care is grim, however young they are. About 30 to 40% of those on a ventilator will have a “very poor” outcome, said Dr Laha, while those who do survive will need a tracheotomy – a tube inserted into the windpipe through the front of the throat – to help them breathe. The average stay in critical care is two weeks but the recovery time for many is measured in years, not months. As we talk, a patient on a ventilator is wheeled outside in his hospital bed for a rare breath of fresh air, nearly two months after he caught coronavirus. Although there are far fewer patients in critical care, the level of staff absence is taking a huge toll. One in 10 of the hospital’s staff are off work, in line with the average across NHS England, but on the Covid ward about 30% of staff have been ill or isolating since Christmas Day. On some night shifts before Christmas, there were only two nurses and three healthcare assistants for 35 patients. “The staffing pressures just before Christmas were horrendous. It was awful,” said Olivia Robinson, a 22-year-old nurse on the Covid ward. “You would be at home worried about coming in for the next shift. You’d never sleep for worrying about what you were walking into.” The stress became so great that Robinson, who qualified a year ago, left her staff job for a role that means she can choose her shifts. The latest NHS figures suggest hospitalisations across England are stabilising, giving ministers confidence that the system will be able to cope. Suggestions that the government could lift the working from home guidance on 26 January, when the plan B legislation expires, has prompted warnings from NHS leaders against “dangerous complacency”. Doctors at the Royal Preston expect patient numbers to rise again in the coming week due to people mixing and going on holiday around the new year. When this wave has passed, there will be no time to rest. Each of the almost 4,000 Covid patients treated by Munavvar and his colleagues need a follow-up consultation. Some will require support for years. “Where do we find the space to do that, the time to do that?” he asked.",News/World news,‘Christmas was awful’: on the Omicron frontline at the Royal Preston hospital,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/christmas-was-awful-on-the-omicron-frontline-at-the-royal-preston-hospital
1/17/2022,"More than one in 10 fish oil supplements tested from among 60 large retail brands are rancid, while nearly half are just under the recommended maximum limit, according to independent tests. Conducted over several years by Labdoor, which analyses vitamins and supplements based on criteria such as purity, label accuracy and nutritional value, the tests measured common US-branded fish oils, available globally, against international voluntary standards of rancidity.  Some fish oils recorded levels 11 times higher than recommended limits. Rancidity arises when a product becomes oxidised. In fish oil, a rancid example can involve a strong fishy taste and rotten smell. “It was fairly frequent,” said Dan Mark, Labdoor’s research director. “For us, they would start to smell and feel off.” The rancidity is often masked by flavourings, which are added to most fish oils to reduce the fishy taste and smell. Other evaluations are producing similar results. A combination of global studies since 2015 showed that an average of 20% of fish oil products have excess oxidation. “That means if you go out and buy fish oil, there is at least a one in five chance of you getting an oil more oxidised than the recommended level,” said Dr Ben Albert, fellow at the University of Auckland, whose research focuses on the health effects of fish oil. Fish oils are extremely popular, particularly in the US, where they are consumed by more than a third of adults who use dietary supplements. They are touted as an alternative to eating fish for getting omega-3 nutrients, and as beneficial for heart disease, improving brain function and strengthening metabolism. Many have flavourings added. “Flavouring is added to fish oils to help mask fishy smell and taste, and … might make more oxidised oils more palatable for people to take, so it could also be used to hide oxidation of the oil,” said Albert. Albert said smell was not a reliable indicator of oxidation. “Some fish oils will smell more than others, but if they don’t smell bad, that doesn’t tell you it’s not oxidised,” he said. Given that the supplement market is largely unregulated, voluntary limits for oxidative quality were created by the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3 (GOED), an industry body with about 170 members that aims to increase consumption of omega-3s. The recommended limit was set at 26, an arbitrary and unitless measure of oxidation, and is the most common and strictest worldwide benchmark for fish oil quality. So, the higher the number, the more rancid the oil, though it is important to note that it is an indication of quality, not safety. The GOED maintains that the majority of its members’ fish oil products are within the limits. But according to Labdoor’s analysis, conducted on products between 2014 and 2018, fish oils under the brand names Carlson Labs and Puritan’s Pride, which retail in chains such as Walmart and Amazon, had rancidity grades significantly higher than the suggested limits: 281.8 for Carlson’s Norwegian cod liver oil and 37.1 for Puritan Pride’s soft-gel fish oil. Other brands that exceeded limits were Oceanblue, with an oxidation value of 73.9, and Nature’s Answer, which tested at 34.4. Half of all products tested by Labdoor bordered on the GOED limit, at an average of 24.4. Oxidation is a normal process in all oils that contain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fish oil is particularly susceptible to oxidising, which happens faster when exposed to heat, air or light. It is also prone to oxidisation because of its long supply chain, which often lacks appropriate preventive measures. Most fish oil comes from anchovetas in Peru. Annual catches exceed 4m tonnes, mainly used for aquaculture, with an estimated 38,000 tonnes of anchovy oil extracted for supplements, according to GOED. Once harvested, the oil is often sent to China for extraction and distillation, before coming back to North America or Europe to be packaged. At each step, the oil must be handled quickly and at low temperatures. “To prevent oxidation, you have to focus on it from the beginning when the fish is caught, because when the oil is oxidised you can’t restore it back to freshness,” said ​​Bo Martinsen, an omega-3 specialist and co-founder of the fish oil company Omega3 Innovations. Whether rancid fish oil is harmful remains unclear. So far, sporadic studies have shown that highly oxidised fish oil capsules can have a negative impact on cholesterol levels. When tested in high doses in animals, the oils were shown to have toxic effects. “It certainly tells us that oxidation changes the way these oils work,” Albert said. “The fact that we know from animals that the effects change when it’s oxidised would mean that a reasonable human consumer would want to avoid oxidised oils – but they can’t do that themselves.” Whether it is harmful or not, rancid oil is likely to be less effective than fresh fish oil, according to Martinsen. He points to changes in the chemical composition of highly oxidised oils that may reduce their benefits. Again, however, the research is not conclusive. The GOED has been pushing back on criticism for years. After a 2015 study by Albert noted that 92% of products in New Zealand exceeded one of the recommended oxidation limits, it conducted its own replication study in 2017 and the results were much lower, with less than 20% of the products exceeding the limits. Gerard Bannenberg, director of technical compliance at GOED, said: “I don’t think people need to be concerned about oxidation. The level we’re talking about is very low. Even if the product is slightly oxidised, it’s very unlikely that it will harm our health.” Only Nature’s Answer responded to the Guardian’s request for comment, maintaining that typical results for their fish oil ranges have a total oxidation value of 10. Any results over 25, such as in Labdoor’s tests, indicate improper handling and storage, they say, which is likely to be in the supply chain before being tested. Martinsen said: “The GOED recommended limit is not a magical number that means something important for how that pill will act in your body. In principle, we should have regulatory levels at which health effects change, but we don’t know those levels.” In general, Albert warns, fish oil supplements are hard to trust.",News/Environment,Revealed: many common omega-3 fish oil supplements are ‘rancid’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/17/revealed-many-common-omega-3-fish-oil-supplements-are-rancid
