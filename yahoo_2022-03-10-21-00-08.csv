3/10/2022,"Donald Trump Jr. now claims his father’s well-known affection toward some of the world’s most brutal dictators was part of an elaborate act. “He knew exactly how to play these guys,” the son of former President Donald Trump said in a new video. “And he played it like a fiddle.” Trump made a habit of alienating U.S. allies, such as Canada, France and Germany, while also cozying up to repressive dictators. He said he “fell in love” with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He repeatedly praised and defended Russian President Vladimir Putin. And he called himself a “big fan” of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan despite the Turkish despot’s brutal crackdown on critics.

3/10/2022,"(Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Thursday that Russia's economy was experiencing a shock and that measures were being taken to soften the impact of what it described as an ""absolutely unprecedented"" economic war being waged against Moscow. The West has imposed sweeping sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. ""Our economy is experiencing a shock impact now and there are negative consequences, they will be minimised,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call. He described the situation as turbulent, but said that measures to calm and stabilise it were already being taken. ""This is absolutely unprecedented. The economic war that has started against our country has never taken place before. So it is very hard to forecast anything.""

3/10/2022,"(Reuters) - China has refused to supply Russian airlines with aircraft parts, an official at Russia's aviation authority was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying on Thursday, after Boeing and Airbus halted supply of components. Russia's aviation sector is being squeezed by Western sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine, with Russia's foreign ministry warning this week that the safety of Russian passenger flights was under threat. Agencies including Interfax quoted Valery Kudinov, a Rosaviatsia official responsible for maintaining airplane airworthiness, as saying that Russia would look for opportunities to source parts from countries including Turkey and India after a failed attempt to obtain them from China. He also said Russian companies were registering their planes, many of which had been registered abroad, in Russia after the U.S. and European Union sanctions on aviation and that he expects some others to be returned to leasing companies. Separately, a draft law published on Thursday showed the Russian government plans to order domestic airlines to pay for leased aircraft in roubles and could bar them from returning planes to foreign companies if leases are cancelled.

3/10/2022,"By Josh Smith SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea will launch a number of reconnaissance satellites in coming years to provide real-time information on military actions by the United States and its allies, state media on Thursday reported leader Kim Jong Un as saying. While inspecting North Korea's National Aerospace Development Administration, Kim said ""a lot"" of military reconnaissance satellites would be put into sun-synchronous polar orbit in the period of a five-year plan announced last year, state news agency KCNA reported. ""He noted that the purpose of developing and operating the military reconnaissance satellite is to provide the armed forces of the DPRK with real-time information on military actions against it by the aggression troops of the U.S. imperialism and its vassal forces in south Korea, Japan and the Pacific,"" the news agency said. North Korea appears to be preparing to launch a reconnaissance satellite, which could prove as controversial as the nuclear-armed country's weapons tests because they use the same banned ballistic missile technology, experts say. North Korea says it conducted two tests of satellite systems on Feb. 27 and March 5. Authorities in South Korea, Japan, and the United States says the tests involved launches of ballistic missiles. The launches drew international condemnation and the U.S. military said on Thursday it had increased surveillance and reconnaissance collection in the Yellow Sea. The United States also said it had heightened its ballistic missile defence readiness after a ""significant increase"" in North Korean missile tests. Kim defended the satellite work as not only about gathering information but protecting North Korea's sovereignty and national interests, exercising its legitimate rights to self-defence, and elevating national prestige, KCNA reported. ""He stressed that this urgent project for perfecting the country's war preparedness capacity by improving our state's war deterrent is the supreme revolutionary task, a political and military priority task to which our Party and government attach the most importance,"" KCNA said. The United States and its allies have condemned previous North Korean space launches as violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions that have imposed sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programmes. 'MILITARY SIGNIFICANCE' North Korea has not tested a nuclear weapon or its long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) since 2017, but has suggested in could resume such tests because talks with the United States are stalled. Its latest flurry of missile launches could be groundwork for a return to ICBM and nuclear bomb tests this year, the U.S. Directorate of National Intelligence (DNI) said in its annual Worldwide Threat Assessment released this week. A satellite launched into orbit would be the first since 2016. Recent sub-orbital launches, which likely used road-mobile medium-range ballistic missiles, appeared designed to ""pop the key components of an imagery reconnaissance satellite up to operational altitudes for a few minutes of testing"", 38 North, a U.S.-based monitoring group, said in a report. Such components, including satellite stabilisation, the imaging payload, and data transmission may have failed in previous tests and therefore required additional testing, the group said. ""It remains to be seen how capable any North Korean imagery satellite would be, the frequency of launches, or how many such satellites might be maintained in orbit at any one time—all key indicators of the actual military significance of such satellites,"" 38 North said. Regardless, North Korea clearly sees this capability as having propaganda value and showcasing its technological prowess and effective leadership, it added. A launch could make technical contributions to North Korea’s ICBM capability, depending on what type of rocket booster is used, 38 North said. ""It may also be the precursor to other more provocative developments mentioned by Kim, such as the testing of multiple-warhead missiles, solid-propellant ICBMs, and ICBM-range solid-propellant submarine-launched ballistic missiles,"" it said.

3/10/2022,"Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea Football Club, has become the latest and most high-profile Russian oligarch to be sanctioned in Britain in punishment for the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions mean that all of the billionaire’s U.K. assets, including his treasured English Premier League club and multimillion pound property portfolio, will be frozen with immediate effect. The Putin confidante will no longer be allowed to travel to the U.K. or carry out any financial transactions with individuals or companies based in Britain. Just last week, Abramovich announced he was selling Chelsea—the club he’s bankrolled to success since 2003—as countries around the world cracked down on Russian assets. That multi-billion sale will no longer go ahead as planned, with an unnamed British government source telling The Times: “He will not get a penny from the sale of the club.” The sanctions will also have a more direct effect on his beloved club. Chelsea, the current world champions, will no longer be able to sell tickets to games, so only existing season ticket holders will be able to attend its upcoming fixtures. Its merchandise store will be closed, the club won’t be able to spend more than $26,000 on travel to each game, and it will be impossible to buy or sell players or negotiate new contracts. In its announcement, the British government cited Abramovich’s decades-long “close relationship” with President Vladimir Putin to justify its sanctions. It said Putin had helped Abramovich build his extreme wealth with “preferential treatment and concessions” for years, and the sanctions are designed to stop him from making further profit in Britain. The Chelsea owner was one of seven oligarchs to be hit in the fresh round of British sanctions alongside fellow notorious Russian billionaires Igor Sechin and Oleg Deripaska. Britain said the seven all have close links to Putin and an estimated collective net worth nearly $20 billion. “There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putin’s vicious assault on Ukraine,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement announcing his latest anti-Putin moves. “Today’s sanctions are the latest step in the U.K.’s unwavering support for the Ukrainian people. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies.” The oligarchs sanctioned by Britain also have links to property portfolios in the United States. Abramovich offloaded $92.3 million of New York City real estate to his ex-wife, Darya Zhukova, as part of an apparent settlement in 2018. According to The New York Times, Abramovich had been in the process of combining four townhouses on 75th Street into a mega-mansion when he transferred them into the name of his former partner. Deripaska, best known in the U.S. for his ties Paul Manafort, Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman who was convicted of fraud, has been repeatedly sanctioned by the U.S. federal government, and the FBI raided a Washington mansion linked to the Putin ally in October last year.
