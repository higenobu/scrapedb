4/30/2022,"The family of a retired British geologist facing the death penalty in Iraq have called on the UK government to urgently intervene. Jim Fitton, 66, was detained by authorities in the Middle Eastern country, accused of smuggling, during a geology and archaeology trip. Fitton, who lives in Malaysia, and an unnamed German man were arrested when airport security found shards of broken pottery in their luggage as they attempted to leave the country, according to his children. But they insist he had been informed the fragments held no economic or historical value to Iraq before collecting them at a site in Eridu on 20 March. Now they say he is due to face trial in the week commencing 8 May, after Eid al-Fitr in Iraq. His children, Joshua and Leila, and Leila’s husband, Sam Tasker, say Fitton could receive the death penalty if found guilty and have launched a petition calling on the British government to intervene in the case. A statement read: “We have days to save him before sentencing and we need the Foreign Office to help by intervening in his case now. “Our lawyer has drafted a proposal for cessation of the case and the immediate repatriation of our father, which requires the backing of the Foreign Office to put to the Iraqi judiciary.” Tasker added: “Jim would often bring home small souvenirs from his trips to remember the journey by and share his experiences with us. To him this was no more significant than bringing home a small stone from the beach to remember a special family holiday. The items are widely agreed to be valueless. “This is the offence that now sees my father-in-law facing a potential death sentence under article 41 of the Iraqi artefacts law no.55, of 2002.” He said the pair were arrested after the group’s baggage was checked at the airport, with 12 shards said to have been found. Tasker is a constituent of Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat MP for Bath, who has raised the case in the House of Commons and urged ministers to respond to the “incredibly serious” issue. Foreign Office minister Amanda Milling, in a letter to Hobhouse, said: “We understand the urgency of the case, and have already raised our concerns with the Iraqi authorities regarding the possible imposition of the death penalty in Mr Fitton’s case.”",News/World news,Family of British geologist facing death penalty in Iraq urge UK to intervene,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/30/jim-fitton-family-of-british-geologist-facing-death-penalty-in-iraq-urge-uk-to-intervene
4/30/2022,"The question was met by a rolling of the eyes and an exaggerated shudder. Fun as Arsenal’s ultimately convincing win over Manchester United was, would Mikel Arteta sign up for five equivalent white-knuckle rides over the remainder of their run-in? “Hopefully not,” he replied after the minor theatrics, which preempted his point, had subsided. “But the last games of the season tend to go a little bit like that, [because of] the fatigue of the players, the stress of different elements. It’s possible. So we have to handle that chaos as well if it happens.” Arteta had described the United game, which was hardly a ringing endorsement of either side’s ability to place a steady hand on the tiller even if Arsenal were superior, as a “rollercoaster”. That has been one of the manager’s pet phrases: he used it as far back as February when predicting the nature of the chase for Champions League places and he has learned not to be too surprised when, within minutes of kick-off, the most carefully-laid plans become dust. But it is not deployed with relish. Arteta, a touchline micromanager who would pre-ordain every one of his side’s movements if he could, has a natural aversion to disorder but knows his team must develop coping mechanisms for any loss of control. “It’s something that is part of our training, part of the plan we have in every game,” he said. “How we control a situation, how we take a situation into our favour. But in football a lot of things are unpredictable and we need to know how to react to them.” Ideally, though, Arsenal would tread a far more stable path to elite European football. It is rarely sustainable to turn games into high-octane coin tosses over a lengthy stretch, even if you have enough quality to feel confident playing the odds. That is even more so when you are facing close rivals although West Ham, eight points and three places behind, have more or less been seen off in the top-four battle. For Arsenal, what might once have seemed a knife-edge London derby now looks more like an occasion to assert authority and avoid doing anything stupid. Nobody gets an easy ride from David Moyes’s side, as his former mentee Arteta knows exceptionally well, but the prognosis looks favourable given the assignment West Ham face in Frankfurt on Thursday and the lung-busting efforts with which Declan Rice, Jarrod Bowen and company attempted to turn around their Europa League semi-final first leg until the very last. Should results go their way this weekend, Arsenal will be guaranteed a top-six spot and effectively certain of a return to Europe in some form. On Friday, Arteta was swift to point out that their ambitions do not end there. A curious run, those topplings of United and Chelsea coming on the back of puzzling defeats to Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton, has ended with Arsenal just about holding pole position for fourth; they have veered up and down just as Arteta feared, although the demands placed upon his squad offer much of the reason. At London Stadium, Arteta will almost certainly start with Mohamed Elneny in central midfield and Eddie Nketiah, whose two goals at Stamford Bridge may have placed a question mark above what had appeared a cut-and-dried summer exit, leading the line. Nuno Tavares, an entertainingly loose cannon who visibly exasperates Arteta at times, will continue at left-back. At least he knows what he is getting from the first two: unflashy steadiness and security from Elneny; energy and an ability to snaffle scraps in around the six-yard box from Nketiah. Neither player had been particularly close to his Premier League starting XI until the past fortnight and both had to fill voids, created by injury in the middle and chronic bluntness at centre-forward. Elneny’s selection was intended as a measure to mitigate the absence of Thomas Partey, who is unlikely to play again this season and in whose presence Arsenal have a vastly more consistent record. “The win rate when Thomas is there is higher and that is something that is not good for us,” Arteta said. He spoke of “using [alternatives] in a different way, changing formation and finding ways to compensate”. It is a fancy way of saying Arsenal have had to patch and mend, which is not a state of affairs conducive to maximum levels of control. When Partey played alongside Granit Xhaka, usually combining with Martin Ødegaard further in front and receiving possession from Ben White behind, Arsenal looked a finely-tuned machine born of hours’ work on the training pitch and bundles of natural talent. Kieran Tierney, whose injury meant Arteta was eventually persuaded to trust Tavares, would know intuitively when to surge forward and receive one of Partey’s raking passes. In Tavares’s case, nobody is quite sure what the next move will be, although a pretty important one was the opening goal against United. To improvise necessarily means to compromise; Arteta has been given little choice but to tolerate his stand-ins’ foibles, give himself up to a few of those late-season uncertainties and hope Arsenal can roll over the line. If they capitalise on West Ham’s distractions and dominate as they would like at London Stadium, taking another win, they will edge closer to what had seemed an unthinkable turnaround in fortunes. Last March, Arsenal went three goals down at the same venue before salvaging a point and almost escaping with all of them; Arteta would be horrified at the idea of a repeat but must know by now that any celebrations in three weeks’ time will not have been earned the easy way.",Sport/Football,Mikel Arteta hopes Arsenal can stay off rollercoaster during run-in,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/30/mikel-arteta-hopes-arsenal-can-stay-off-rollercoaster-during-run-in

4/30/2022,"Mid-morning in New Orleans, and outside an Uptown coffee shop, Win Butler is talking of life in his adopted city – the basketball, brass bands, and the poisonous caterpillars of the buck moth that, in late spring, fall from the city’s trees on to unsuspecting passersby beneath. He surveys the mighty oaks across the street, broad-branched and strung with moss. “Trees run this city,” Butler says. “They’ve definitely seen some shit, those trees.” With his wife, Régine Chassagne, Butler is best known for fronting Arcade Fire. The band formed in Montreal at the turn of the millennium, quickly gained a reputation as one of the world’s finest live acts, and over the course of five albums became indie music aristocracy. They were anointed by Davids Bowie and Byrne; they won a Grammy, a Juno and a Brit; they played Obama’s inauguration; and frequently used their platform for political activism, promoting healthcare nonprofits, indigenous protesters and a number of Haitian charities (Chassagne is of Haitian descent). More recently, the band raised $100,000 for the Ukraine Relief Fund by playing a series of small club shows across the US, including cult New York venue the Bowery ballroom. At times they have irked their audiences: the hijinks that surrounded the launch of their disco-tinged 2013 album Reflektor – secret gigs, street parties, audience dress codes – brought faintly unsettling echoes of U2’s Zoo TV campaign. But it was the release of their last album, 2017’s Everything Now, that rattled fans the most. The album was accompanied by a high-concept promotional campaign claiming that Arcade Fire were now part of a multinational corporation. They named their tour Infinite Content, and posted parodic record reviews, fake news stories, ironic product placements. To some, it was a glittering commentary on the consumer age; to others it seemed sneering, over-earnest and ill-conceived. To many, it was uncomfortably removed from the visceral heart-swell of their live shows. This month, the band release their sixth album, We, a record they describe as being about “the forces that pull us away from the people we love … [and] the urgent need to overcome them”. This being Arcade Fire, there is a hefty intellectual backstory, nods to the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* and a guest turn by Peter Gabriel. But it also stands as the band’s most tender record since their early output; spacious and simple and sweet, an album born out of the steady closeness of pandemic days. Butler, Chassagne and their son moved to Louisiana six years ago, captivated by its mingling of cultures and unbridled passion for music and creativity. “What’s that Mark Twain line about there being only three cities in America?” Butler asks as we walk along Magazine Street. “New York, San Francisco and New Orleans. Everything else is Cleveland.” Butler cuts a conspicuous figure: basketball player-tall, with bleached blond hair, today he is wearing cream-coloured jeans, a tie-dyed white T-shirt and black bomber jacket. There is an intensity to the way he speaks, whether he is talking about a Mardi Gras spent playing cowbell in New Orleans’ TBC Brass Band, or the hanging chads of the 2000 US presidential race. But he seems to fit comfortably in this neighbourhood, greeting the coffee shop barista warmly and gleefully relating the history of Miss Mae’s, a 24-hour “dirtbag bar” that stands on the corner of Magazine and Napoleon. Down the street, Butler leads us into a former luncheonette, now home to Peaches Records. Peaches, he says, is some way removed from the record shop he frequented as a teenager in the suburbs of Houston, Texas – a chainstore in the mall that mostly sold CDs, and where he tried to nourish his love of New Order and the Cure. He talks of how his mother played jazz harp, his grandfather played the pedal steel, and how the first time he heard Smokey Robinson sing, he couldn’t quite believe that this music had been made by human beings. “Look at this,” Butler says, holding up an octagonal copy of the Rolling Stones’ compilation Through the Past Darkly, and holding forth on the qualities of a good record sleeve. His attention alights on Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon, and the merits of the short album. “There’s like four songs on it and a lot of connective tissue,” he says. “And they sort of stretch it, so you have this space to hear stuff. That’s not even my favourite record, but it’s an example of coherence. You look at the album artwork, you listen to it, it’s very coherent.” He was seeking something similar on We, he says, paring back more songs than ever before to make a taut 40-minute record. “We cut some really good shit,” he says. “That’s how we did it.” We walk along Napoleon to a Creole-Italian restaurant to meet Chassagne. This afternoon, the rest of the band will arrive in New Orleans to begin tour rehearsals, and Butler is eager to be back out in the world again after the restrictions of lockdown. He recalls the band’s recent show in New York, how good it felt to be before a crowd once more. “One hundred people spitting in my face,” he says. “It felt like being baptised.” At the counter in Pascal’s Manale, the oyster shucker Thomas “Uptown T” Stewart stands beside a mound of silver shells, discussing the peaceful pleasures of Cyrano de Bergerac, jazz, poetry and softly spoken people. We are drinking martinis, and Butler is trying to persuade me that the best way to eat an oyster is to sit it atop a saltine cracker, with horseradish, ketchup and a little lemon juice. Chassagne stands beside him and unceremoniously slugs black a Gulf oyster from its shell. Stewart is impressed. “You knocked that down like you just did a shot of good bourbon!” he tells her. “I caught your rhythm. You have a lot of good energy.” Chassagne’s energy has always been undeniable. When Butler first saw her she was singing jazz standards at an art opening in Montreal, and he immediately asked her to join his fledgling band. The strands of what she has described as her “grandmother music” – opera and Jacques Brel and Edith Piaf, somehow melding with Butler’s art pop influences. On stage, they perform a similar feat: Chassagne singing, dancing, shifting between accordion, keys and xylophone, seemingly existing in her own orbit as the rest of the band play on. Back at the table this lunchtime, she sits in a black batwing top and black jeans, her dark curls jigging along to the theme to Captain Kangaroo, inexplicably playing on the restaurant stereo. “I haven’t heard this song in for ever!” she says, suddenly distracted. Chassagne does this often – a sentence drawing suddenly to a halt so she can sing along with a chorus, then dart back to the conversation. Before the detour into Captain Kangaroo, she was recalling how the new album took root in pre-Covid America, in the days of the Trump presidency. “It was pretty turbulent times in the US,” she says. “You would wake up and you had no idea what was going to happen.” The band began work on a record they hoped might reflect that turbulence: tracks such as the slow, syrupy End of the Empire reflecting the decline of western power, with references to the cauterising effect of television, the urge to unsubscribe and watching the moon on the ocean “where California used to be”. The album opens with Age of Anxiety I and II, tracks that take their name from Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s 1958 poem I Am Waiting. When Butler was 15, his beatnik English teacher invited his good friend Ferlinghetti to read at his school. It was a life-changing moment for Butler; so much so that he stole a copy of the poet’s Coney Island of the Mind from the school library. Not so long ago, he found the book in a box of his belongings at his parents’ house and began rereading. When he came across the poem I Am Waiting, “I just started weeping,” he says. “All the themes in that poem, it’s like all the shit I write about. Like looking for the soul of America, waiting for the American eight ball to straighten up and fly right. It got so deep in me. Like a spirit got in me.” Butler’s relationship with his homeland has always been complicated and contradictory and highly charged. “This shit is fucking rotten, but there’s beautiful things about it,” he says. “I live in America, I can’t believe I still live in America. But there’s something about it that I can’t quit. And as an artist you’re trying to break something open and let the light in.” He talks about the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan and the war in Ukraine. “And it’s poor people who suffer,” he says. “Always, everywhere, always poor people suffer. Russian oligarchs are losing one of their boats, like boo hoo. Which boat did you lose? They’re all fine. But all the money is blood money, it’s all from the suffering of poor people.” What role can music play? Butler pauses. “We’re the court jesters,” he says. “We’re performing in the court. The infrastructure of the thing is money. I don’t know the answer. But you can kind of undercut it.” Across the table, Chassagne frowns. “It’s not the court,” she says firmly. “There’s no prerequisite on who to play music for. We play music in hospitals, for dying patients, we played at the inauguration. It’s food for the soul. It’s not that the music cures the community, but the music is the evidence that there is a community. It’s like evidence of life.” Arcade Fire’s lineup has shifted over the years, but for We it numbered Richard Reed Parry, Tim Kingsbury, Jeremy Gara and Butler’s younger brother Will, who has since amicably left the band. When the pandemic began, they had all flown to New Orleans to begin work on the new record. “And then our phones keep beeping and we’re getting texts saying flights are getting cancelled, borders getting closed,” remembers Chassagne. “So we had to do an emergency plan for them to go back immediately. Everything was falling apart.” When everyone departed, Chassagne and Butler were left with three days’ worth of demos. “Glorified writing sessions”, as Butler puts it. “But at a point, I thought: ‘Well, this might be all there is so I’m going to work on this as if we’re never going to play music again,’” he says. “And I realised that even just three days, there was so much music in there. So it was like: well, that’s all we have. This is it. It’s DIY.” For months, the pair stayed home and wrote with an intensity that they had been unable to find since their debut album, Funeral. “We were stuck in our house and so what do you do?” says Chassagne. “I guess the interesting thing is that when you’re stuck with yourself you ask: ‘What am I here for?!’ So we just wrote and wrote and recorded … ” The songs soon began to pile up. “We just worked every day,” says Butler. “All night, as if it was due the next day, but for like, a year.” On Butler and Chassagne’s first date they went to see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Chassagne had failed to mention that the film would have French subtitles, and so she spent the movie whispering translations to Butler in the dark of the cinema. Today over lunch, there seems a similar connection; a closeness to their dynamic that I have not seen since I interviewed them back in 2005 for Funeral. Their sentences frequently overlap, Butler picking up where Chassagne leaves off. Their new album might come with a clever marketing campaign, slick videos, an artful mission statement that mentions Carl Jung and Martin Luther King. But at its heart lies something really quite simple: the connection that spans between the extended family of a band, that exists between a band and its audience, that binds two people over the course of a 20-year relationship. There are two distinct halves to this record: the first tells of isolation, the second is about resolve. “It’s about unconditional love, love that’s not merit-based,” says Butler. “That’s not about loving someone because they’re such a good person, or they’re so talented. It’s love that has nothing to do with what you did, it’s something that’s freely given, and that’s why it’s the most precious thing.” He begins to sip Chassagne’s untouched martini. “Loving someone is hard,” he says. “It’s up and down, it’s a tough thing, but it’s also the shit.” Chassagne nods. “And the beauty’s in the commitment.” Outside, the city is closing down under a tornado warning, shops shuttering, restaurants hurrying away their patio chairs. We drive back along Magazine Street with the windows down and the high winds blowing, listening to a top-secret remix of Age of Anxiety II (Rabbit Hole), a call-and-response track between the pair. “Nothing can ever replace it / When it’s gone you can still taste it,” runs the lyric. “Going on this trip together … ” In the front seat, Butler shakes his head; behind him Chassagne pats her hands rhythmically into the air, silently finding her way into the song. We drive on through the Garden District, past a seafood boil and the alligator museum, and on towards Arcade Fire’s rehearsal space. Outside, against the darkening sky, the tops of the oak trees wave wildly. We is released on 6 May. If you’d like to hear this piece narrated, listen to the Guardian’s new podcast, Weekend.

4/30/2022,"In the action-packed film Moonraker, James Bond escapes from Jaws, the metal-toothed villain, on a hang-glider that ejects from a speedboat just as he drives over the precipice of a waterfall. It is one of numerous outlandish scenes in the film that Ian Fleming never wrote in his original 007 novel. And it could not be more different to the author’s own version of the film, according to a previously unpublished script. In 1956, a year after the Moonraker novel was published, Fleming wrote his own 150-page film treatment with a plot that is as serious as the 1979 film is lightweight, despite Roger Moore’s charm as the fictional spy. Just as in the novel, Bond is portrayed as a cold-hearted assassin, but Fleming makes some changes. The head of the British secret intelligence service is not called “M”, and more closely resembles an affable 1950s city gent than the gruff character of the novels and films. M’s flirtatious secretary, Miss Moneypenny, is conspicuous by her absence. A Cockney card sharp called Tosh – a special branch officer working undercover – is one of a new cast of characters who take on the villain Hugo Drax. Jon Gilbert, an expert in Fleming literature, told the Observer: “This is the very first screenplay written by Fleming imagining Bond for the big screen. It is his only attempt at a film script, so it’s hugely important. It is a very Bondian scenario – a megalomaniac who wants to see the downfall of Britain.” But the Rank Organisation, at the time the biggest film company in the UK, failed to see its potential. The typed screenplay, still in its Rank folder, remained forgotten decades after Fleming had submitted it. The novelist had to wait until 1962, two years before his death, to see any of his novels adapted for cinema: Albert (“Cubby”) Broccoli and Harry Saltzman adapted his 1958 novel Dr No for the now classic film starring Sean Connery, which led to one of cinema’s most successful franchises. All 12 of the Bond novels, including From Russia With Love, became popular motion pictures, although many strayed from Fleming’s original plots. The undeveloped screenplay has come to light as part of a major collection of Bond material amassed by two leading antiquarian bookshops in London, Peter Harrington and Adrian Harrington Rare Books, where Gilbert is the resident Fleming expert. In the screenplay, 007 and a policewoman go swimming off the coast of Kent. Gilbert said: “Bond wears light blue swimming shorts – as blue as his eyes – which would become a defining image of Bond, along with the black tuxedo, portrayed by Connery and revived by Daniel Craig. It would appear to originate here with Fleming, rather than a later screenwriter. That’s quite significant. It’s conceivable that Fleming then developed this when discussing the subsequent films with Broccoli and Saltzman.” Fleming had been an officer serving in British naval intelligence during the second world war and was a journalist before becoming a full-time novelist. Gilbert said that his screenplay was fascinating, but “far too descriptive”. A true scriptwriter would have concentrated on the dialogue, with minimal directions: “That’s why it’s 150 pages. Screenplays for Bond films … are usually 100 pages. But it reads very well.” He added that the screenplay is “much more serious” than the 1979 film, which reflects the time when it was created: “You have the threat of the cold war and serious nuclear threats. In the 1970s, the films reflected a climate that wasn’t life-threatening.” The screenplay had been under the radar until it surfaced at a Bonhams auction in 2015, from where it was acquired by a private collector. Andrew Lycett, author of the biography Ian Fleming: The Man Who Created James Bond, told the Observer: “Finding this screenplay is very exciting. Fleming was obsessed with getting his books filmed. He tried very hard to interest producers in the UK and US. “In 1954, he corresponded with producer Alexander Korda, who had read a proof of his second novel, Live and Let Die, and had praised it. Fleming wrote to him about his third novel – still to be written – which would be Moonraker. He said it was ‘an expansion of a film story I’ve had in my mind since the war’. This was ‘a straight thriller with particularly English but also general appeal, allowing for some wonderful film settings’. He then went to Jamaica to write the book, which came out the following spring. The point is that Fleming always conceived Moonraker as ‘a film story’. So, to find his screenplay is particularly interesting.”",Arts/Books,Ian Fleming’s lost James Bond screenplay reveals a very different 007,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/30/ian-fleming-lost-james-bond-screenplay-moonraker-007
4/30/2022,"Curiosity, as Abel Selaocoe reminded us in his welcome to Manchester Collective’s first Queen Elizabeth Hall date, is key to music, to its future, its vitality. The multitalented cellist, who grew up in a township of South Africa and completed his formal studies in Manchester’s Royal Northern College of Music, is right. It’s the very sap. It applies as much to an ensemble like the Collective, who play experimental gigs, dress as they choose, shoes on or off, and rove freely between styles, as to a symphony orchestra performing Brahms or a choir singing Handel. Every live performance is both a first and last. How do musicians meet this responsibility? You know the question has not been addressed when a good performance falls flat. There was no danger of that here. Energy and intensity prevailed. Already a fixture at pioneering venues such as Kings Place, Selaocoe has established a wide following. Now everyone wants a bit of his magic. His rise, achieved through virtuosity and hard work as well as charm and flair, has been swift and deserved. So too has the Collective’s. Founded in 2016, their journey from offbeat venues (I first heard them in an old cricket bat factory three years ago) to mainstage prominence is little short of remarkable. Their challenge will be to maintain their characteristic sense of risk and openness of spirit. Under the music directorship of violinist Rakhi Singh they stand every chance. Their programme with Selaocoe, called The Oracle, ranged from improvisation to Vivaldi and Stravinsky – crisply and incisively played, with restrained additions from electric guitar, talking drum and calabash – to In Nomine, by the 16th-century English composer Picforth, and a bewitching nocturne, sliding and nebulous, by Oliver Leith, Full Like Drips, from Honey Siren (2020). Mica Levi’s Love, world premieres of Selaocoe’s own compositions Camagu, Tshepo and Kae Mo Rata (in which we joined in singing) and a traditional Danish song, Bridal Piece, completed this exuberant set. You can watch it (free) at 4pm today on Manchester Collective’s website or YouTube channel. Every bit as wild in a wholly different way was the all-day Music@Malling festival: Bach’s six Brandenburg Concertos paired with six world premiere commissions, contrasting in style but sympathetic to each other and to Bach. This annual event is the brainchild of the conductor Thomas Kemp, the music superbly performed by Chamber Domaine and star harpsichordist Steven Devine who, alternating with Kemp, directed from the keyboard. The glorious setting is Malling Abbey in Kent, one of the first post-Norman conquest monasteries for women, suppressed in 1538 (the nuns’ refusal to surrender is a separate, gripping story) and now once again a working Benedictine convent. To do each composer justice is impossible, but in order of the concertos that inspired their works: Brian Elias’s Sequel, coloured by the sound of three oboes, bassoon and horns, had the precision and gleam of marquetry. In The Malling Diamond, Michael Price kept all in shimmering balance then gave free rein to the trumpet (dazzling playing from Neil Brough). Deborah Pritchard’s Illumination, distinguished by solo violin and prominent double bass pizzicato, reflected the expansive string sound of Brandenburg No 3. By this point I was relieved we didn’t have voting buttons: each work spoke so eloquently to the Bach there was no choosing between them. Daniel Kidane’s Concerto Grosso experimented with string microtones and beautiful popping and bopping from two recorders. Joseph Phibbs’s Bach Shadows, played as a prelude to Brandenburg No 5, drew ghostly trills from the harpsichord, in poetic duet with solo flute. Finally, Stevie Wishart’s Gold and Precious Silver started and ended with recorded blackbird song and gave the spotlight to the two violas. It was inserted before the last movement of No 6, so we finished the day, minds and ears expanded, with Bach. It all passed in a flash. Let’s hope other ensembles perform these companion pieces. In a week with so much novelty, one other enterprise stood out. Music x Museums, initiated by the conductor Oliver Zeffman, is a series of concerts in major museums (beginning last year at the V&A). All are being filmed for future streaming. Coinciding with the British Library’s recent Beethoven: Idealist, Innovator, Icon exhibition, the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields, conducted by Zeffman, performed the Symphony No 6 “Pastoral” and the Choral Fantasy. First editions of both works were in the exhibition, which we were able to visit beforehand. The concert was in the British Library’s main atrium. In a visual and aural coup, the Bach Choir delivered their short, punchy contribution to the Choral Fantasy from high above on the stairs, with Peter Donohoe, the classy soloist, and the orchestra below.
