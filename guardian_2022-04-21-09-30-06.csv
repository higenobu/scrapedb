4/21/2022,"Since the Covid lockdown in Shanghai began, Hu Bojun has received numerous inquiries about her and her hospital’s counselling services. This month, the US-educated clinical psychologist began facilitating lockdown support groups – in English and Chinese – to clients from “all walks of life”. “Even people from different socio-economic sectors are now attending [counselling] together … My old clients have been coming back, and there are a lot more new clients as well,” she says, adding that a lot more Chinese people have begun talking to her about their mental stress and loneliness in a time of extreme uncertainty. Mental health support is now a much sought-after service in China with more than 400 million citizens estimated to be under some degree of lockdown. Chinese search engine Baidu last week recorded a huge spike in searches for “psychological counselling” since March. Although Covid has dominated news headlines in the past two years, mental illness is another crisis that is changing the lives of millions of Chinese families. Fifty-four million people in China experience depression and about 41 million suffer from anxiety disorders, according to the WHO. These are two of the most prevalent mental disorders in the country. Mental health issues are becoming a growing problem as China ages. Many senior citizens face loneliness when children move away to build their future in big cities. In a 2021 study, researchers found a poignant correlation between the suicide rate of elderly people and companionship. They found that rate decreases by 8.7% during the annual lunar new year, when elderly people receive unusually high levels of family companionship. Other age groups, especially young people are affected, too, by loneliness and isolation. According to recent studies, more Chinese middle school students have experienced insomnia, depression and anxiety during the pandemic. In 2020, a large-scale Chinese survey found that almost 35% of respondents had experienced psychological distress during the height of the pandemic. Yet, until recent years, mental health was not a widely discussed issue in China, and those who experienced mental illness were often misunderstood or stigmatised, says Li Yue, a 20-year-old university student in Luoyang of central China. When Li was diagnosed with severe depression in 2018, her family was confused. Depression was not a familiar vocabulary in the part of China she’s from, and her parents did not know how to respond. “My parents thought for a long time that I was just thinking too much. Sometimes they agreed with me to get treatment and sometimes they opposed it. At the beginning I was very lost and later turned desperate. I didn’t know what to do, and this feeling lasted for a long time,” she recalls. That was four years ago. Last year, a series of popular culture productions touching on mental illness were shown in China. First, a broadway show Next to Normal got people talking about bipolar disorder. The musical toured in Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. A documentary was also broadcast to accompany the tour. Then a few months later, a 40-episode TV series, Psychologist, sparked conversation about mental health. Also in 2021, several art exhibitions that aimed to raise the public’s awareness of mental health were held in China. In Shanghai, a collection of abstract art at the No 600 Gallery that showcased works by patients with mental illness went viral. State-owned news agencies reported on it and on social media, a related hashtag was viewed more than 70m times. Some enterprising individuals have seized on the opportunity, too. Hu says some of her friends have rolled out online training courses to people who wish to be therapists. They also use mobile apps to connect help-seekers with therapists virtually. “Even in smaller cities, there are lots of coaches to help cope with societal pressures,” Hu says. But despite the growing awareness, the question of infrastructure and resources are still a problem. Li says that when she was in hospital, she saw many patients but too few doctors. Her experience reflects a 2017 report by the WHO, which found that there were fewer than nine mental health professionals for every 100,000 people in China. The government has taken some steps to address the problem. In its nationwide Healthy China campaign that began in 2019, Beijing acknowledged the increasing extent of mental health issues in China and pledged to provide at least 80% of patients suffering from depression access to treatment by 2030. The diagnosis four years ago turned out to be a big turning point for Li and her family. After years of treatment and counselling, Li’s life has begun slowly but steadily to get back on track. “It changed the way I look at things and myself,” she says. She’s now majoring in psychology at university.",News/World news,Covid forces China to face mental health crisis a long time in the making,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/covid-forces-china-to-face-mental-health-crisis-a-long-time-in-the-making
4/21/2022,"Bill Shorten has called on Scott Morrison to apologise for saying he is “blessed” to have two daughters without disability to a mother whose autistic son’s care package had been cut. The comment in Wednesday’s leaders’ town hall was a low point for the prime minister in a debate narrowly won by Anthony Albanese, drawing condemnation from disability advocates, Labor and the current and former Australians of the Year, Dylan Alcott and Grace Tame. The government’s campaign spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, has defended the remark, denying that Morrison meant disabled children were a burden and arguing that the “blessing” was not having to struggle for disability support. In the Sky News town hall Catherine asked both leaders about the future of the national disability insurance scheme, citing concerns that her four-year-old son Ethan’s care package had been slashed by 30% after a review. Morrison replied: “I’ve been blessed, we’ve got two children that don’t … haven’t had to go through that. And so for parents, with children who are disabled, I can only try and understand your aspirations for those children.” Autism Awareness Australia said the comments were “disgraceful”: Disgraceful comments by Prime Minister @ScottMorrisonMP during last night's debate. ALL children are #Blessings. Your words speak volumes about how you perceive people with a #disability. “Perhaps you should spend more time fixing and fully funding our NDIS, and less time counting your ‘blessings’,” the not-for-profit said. A disability advocate, Carly Findlay, said the remarks were “ableist” and indicated a belief by some parents “that they are lucky they/their children aren’t disabled”. “When the leader of the country says he’s blessed not to have disabled children, he saying disabled people are burdens, that our parents are unlucky,” she said. “He should be a professional speaker and not make such callous remarks, he should be championing the rights of all Australians.” Labor’s manager of opposition business in the Senate, Katy Gallagher, who has an autistic child, said she found the comments “really offending and quite shocking”. “It is something that people who have a disability, children with autism, it is a kind of response they get all the time,” she told told Channel Seven. “That people are blessed not to have what they have when, in actual fact, every child is a blessing. “Certainly, my daughter enriches my life and my partner’s life every day.” Alcott said he feels “blessed” to be disabled. “Feeling sorry for us and our families doesn’t help. Treating us equally, and giving us the choice and control over our own lives does.” Woke up this morning feeling very blessed to be disabled - I reckon my parents are pretty happy about it too.Feeling sorry for us and our families doesn’t help. Treating us equally, and giving us the choice and control over our own lives does Tame used the gaffe to recall her famous excoriation of Morrison through artful side-eye, tweeting that her autism “blesses those of use who have it with the ability to spot fakes from a mile off”. Autism blesses those of us who have it with the ability to spot fakes from a mile off pic.twitter.com/Ck41YcqAAq Shorten, the former Labor leader and architect of the NDIS established by the Gillard government, reminded Morrison that “every child is a blessing”: ScoMo says he is “blessed” to have two non disabled children. Every child is a blessing. The NDIS is there to help people with disability live their lives to the fullest. The Morrison Gov has slashed NDIS plans for 1000s of children around Australia. Labor will fix the NDIS. Shorten, who is aiming to become minister for government services if Albanese wins next month’s election, then called on Morrison to apologise: My suggestion to Scott Morrison is he apologises to people with disability and their families for his remarks tonight which were insensitive. https://t.co/Ok1B2g3KYh Tanya Plibersek, the shadow education minister, said the comment was “very hurtful” and it would be good if Morrison could “take responsibility” and apologise. The former Greens leader Christine Milne said the comments were “beyond insensitive, downright offensive”, implying “God blessed him but not others”. Government members were out defending the comments on Thursday morning. Birmingham said: “The PM actually in that context was talking about the not having to deal with the many challenges of systems that you have to work through to get the support. “Whilst we have grown the NDIS from being just a few thousand recipients to now supporting 500,000 Australian families, we know there’s still many challenges for individuals,” he told ABC News Breakfast. Birmingham said after the debate Morrison had spoken to Catherine to get her details and follow up on her concerns. He said the remark was “certainly not” intending to portray disabled children as a burden, but that “all Australians” could understand the circumstances for family members and others helping people living with disability “are not always easy circumstances”. The Liberal senator Hollie Hughes, a mother of three including one autistic son, said she did “did not think anything of [the comments] at all”. “I know Scott and Jenny [Morrison had tried for 14 years to have their children and they are blessed with two beautiful daughters. I certainly didn’t take anything negative away from it.” Hughes told ABC News Breakfast that focusing on “one word” meant people were “missing the point of the substantive issue”, that autistic people face issues including higher rates of suicide and unemployment. “I know there were days, very early on, when my son was younger, that were really, really hard. I didn’t feel particularly blessed.” She suggested the outrage was “symptomatic of those who don’t like Scott and want to find something to cling to”.",News/Australia news,Bill Shorten calls on Scott Morrison to apologise for saying he is ‘blessed’ to have children without disability,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/21/bill-shorten-calls-on-scott-morrison-to-apologise-for-saying-he-is-blessed-to-have-children-without-disability
4/21/2022,"Thomas Tuchel admitted that he empathised with a Chelsea supporter who confronted César Azpilicueta after his side stumbled to a 4-2 defeat to Arsenal at Stamford Bridge. Tempers were frayed after Chelsea’s third successive home defeat and Azpilicueta appeared to give as good as he got when he clashed with an angry fan. “I was not part of it, I saw it, but, honestly, I can also understand the fan,” Tuchel said. “It was a totally wild and open game in the first half, already at 2-2 after we came back twice. “We had a good start but again gave the first goal away, which is impossible to do these things in consecutive matches. But we’re doing it. We came back twice and we scored another two in the second half, unfortunately for the wrong side. It’s a level of mistakes, the number of mistakes in consecutive games here at home, it’s impossible at this kind of level. You don’t see this. It’s simply impossible, but we’re doing this at the moment and you cannot win football games like this.” Chelsea, who remain third, have conceded 11 goals in their last three home games. They could not handle Arsenal, who breathed life into their top-four challenge thanks to two goals from Eddie Nketiah, a fine strike from Emile Smith Rowe and a penalty from Bukayo Saka. Arsenal had lost their previous three games but victory over Chelsea moved them level on points with Tottenham with six games left. “I said to the players, if you want to be playing Champions League football, you have to go these stadiums and beat the top teams,” Mikel Arteta said. “So they have done it and I’m really proud of them, but I’m more proud of how we’ve reacted as a group in the past weeks. That gives me more energy to be here.” Arteta praised Saka for scoring his first penalty since missing the decisive one during England’s defeat to Italy in the Euro 2020 final. “When that happened to Bukayo that happened for a reason, and he has come back so strongly since,” Arsenal’s manager said. “But for him to have the courage to say ‘I’m going to take it again’, it must have been in the back of his mind. It was strong for him to say ‘I’m going to do it’.”",Sport/Football,Chelsea’s Tuchel admits to empathising with fan who confronted Azpilicueta,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/chelsea-thomas-tuchel-empathising-with-fan-cesar-azpilicueta-arsenal
