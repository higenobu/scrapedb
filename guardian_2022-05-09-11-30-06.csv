5/9/2022,"Taiwanese people don’t mind queueing. They’ll do it for a well-reviewed restaurant, promotional giveaways, or to take an Instagram photo at a popular tourist site. But at 3pm outside a Gongguan pharmacy in Taipei, there’s grumbling in the line. It’s an inconvenient time to leave work, but for now it’s the only way to get your hands on a rapid Covid-19 test. Twenty minutes after the sales window opens, a woman walks out to the waiting customers: they’ve sold out. People are frustrated, having waited for up to two hours, and some leave to try again tomorrow. Two elderly people lean over a phone, looking at a map for other pharmacies nearby. The pharmacist tells the Guardian that the store is only given 78 tests each day, and always sell out in less than half an hour. She laughs when asked if they can request more. The disappointed customers rush to another pharmacy, where an employee with a megaphone says there are only tests left for the next four people. When one of those four says they aren’t there to buy a test, the woman in fifth place jumps and shrieks with joy. An hour earlier, the central epidemic command centre (CECC) had reported more than 30,000 cases for the previous 24 hours – the first time Taiwan has seen such numbers in this pandemic. Once a poster child for the success of zero-Covid, Taiwan is now dealing with an “Omicron tsunami”. In response – and in stark contrast to regional neighbours – health authorities have decided zero-Covid is no match for the new variant and have flipped the switch to “living with the virus”. “It is the right decision, and it’s also the decision we had to make,” says Dr Chen Chien-jen, Taiwan’s former vice-president and professor of epidemiology. Taiwan closed itself off in early 2020, and employed a regime of stringent contact tracing, social restrictions and personal hygiene measures which it kept even as vaccines and antivirals were developed. It defeated an outbreak of the Alpha strain and another of Delta in 2021. But after the highly virulent Omicron began affecting countries in November and December, Chen says he and other scholars advised the government to start shifting towards living with the virus. “The CECC decided we should adopt the policy some time later when booster shots reached around 40-45% [several months away], but Omicron never waits for anyone,” he tells the Guardian. Instead, it began spreading through the community in March. Hong Kong, Taiwan and China were until now the last three major economies still clinging to zero-Covid. In Hong Kong the policy failed and the virus overwhelmed the city with disastrous results. In China, a steadfast commitment to it has produced arduous and economically damaging lockdowns, especially in Shanghai, with no end in sight. Taiwan appears to have seen both options, and decided on a third. It’s called the “new Taiwanese model”: an acknowledgment that they can’t stop the spread of Omicron, but that they can try – to use an early pandemic-era phrase – to flatten the curve. Cases are still rising and experts predict a peak is three weeks away, with as many as 3.5 million of Taiwan’s 24.5 million people expected to eventually be infected, and up to 16,000 dead. As daily tallies ticked past 30,000 this week, the CECC continued to ease restrictions, drop mandatory QR code check-ins, and reduce quarantine times. It urged people to maintain mask-wearing, work from home if they could, reduce gatherings, get vaccinated and take a rapid test if they felt symptoms. It’s also trusting people to self-report, and isolate or quarantine at home. So is it working? In many ways, yes. Chen notes the fatality rate of the outbreak is still extremely low, below 0.2%. This year 66 people have died with Covid-19, bringing Taiwan’s total to 919 out of more than 345,000 cases. More than 99.75% of Omicron cases are mild or asymptomatic, and residents and businesses are still going about their days without lockdowns or panic. Visitor groups are being gradually allowed to return. Hospitals are not at capacity, thanks to Taiwan pre-emptively ending a policy of mandatory hospitalisation for all cases. The same policy in Hong Kong had filled its hospitals before the wave began, but in Taiwan just 44% of hospital ICU beds (more than 62% in Taipei) were full as of Friday. Prof Yen Muh-yong, the director of the infectious disease department at Cheng Hsin hospital, says Taiwan’s diversion of cases away from hospitals has been “very successful in relieving pressure” so far. But he fears it still won’t be enough for this wave and urges more integration of local and district services, to create surge capacity in the workforce and reduce hospital crowds. As cases rise there are also criticisms, including that the government is more reactive than proactive. Yen says transitioning to coexistence was the right decision, “but the brain is giving directions the hands and feet are not coping with”. “The government did not plan in advance for the procedures and the preparedness to live with the Omicron tsunami.” Rules and regulations change almost daily and incrementally. The death of a two-year-old boy last month highlighted communication failures exacerbated by Taiwan’s entrenched bureaucracy. The child’s parents had wanted to send their son to hospital but got conflicting instructions from multiple health services. By the time they got him to hospital it was too late. In factories, migrant workers have once again been discriminated against with unequal rule enforcement and eased restrictions, and poor vaccination rates among the very old and very young remain too low. Many elderly people have refused to get vaccinated against Covid-19, and the government only recently allowed vaccination for under-12s, despite lobbying from anxious parents. Across the capital city, hospitals are reporting crowds of patients who are not sick with Covid. A nurse and anaesthetist at a Taipei hospital tells the Guardian her colleagues are understaffed and overworked, and don’t feel well supported. “Everyone is nervous and they want to have PCR tests so they come to the emergency room, but there are also the patients who need to get more care than other people.” The nurse says there is not enough protective equipment or backup to replace staff who go on leave because they caught the virus, are a close contact, or need to care for family. Instead, they’re told to keep working as long as they test negative, and are still subject to a pandemic ban on health workers leaving the country. Chen says authorities are addressing the issues in hospitals, but concedes Taiwan didn’t prepare an adequate supply of rapid tests, and still don’t have enough despite growing official reliance on them. On Monday, in response to mounting criticism, the government reverted to allowing some retail stores to sell non-rationed tests at market prices, but it didn’t have access to brand details or supply levels. There is generally widespread support for Taiwan’s efforts. Perhaps one of the biggest hurdles for the “new Taiwanese model” was to flip the narrative from a fear-filled zero-Covid commitment to gradual coexistence. The lower severity of Omicron has helped, says Chen. Taiwan also came under more pressure to reopen after cautious neighbours like South Korea and Japan joined the US and Europe in opening. Recent polling by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation found an almost even split of 45% in favour of a coexistence policy compared to 46.3% who weren’t. In July 2021 – at the tail end of the Alpha outbreak – 58.8% of people were worried the government was lifting restrictions too soon. Support for the CECC and minister Chen’s handling of Covid has also increased in that time, from 66.4% of respondents to 77.7%. Yen says government messaging has been “well disseminated and transparent”. “People are not happy about the deficiencies in testing kit supply, and they are crowding in emergency departments but this can all be improved,” he says. Yen says “there will of course be casualties”, but waiting out the worst of the pandemic until vaccines, treatments and a milder strain came along has brought them a long way. Taiwan is no longer the poster child for zero-Covid, but is hoping it can model something else instead – a calm and steady transition to rejoin the world after more than two years locked away.

5/9/2022,"The second leaders debate of the federal election quickly became bogged down in a slanging match of claim and counter-claim on Sunday night. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, each attempted to live factcheck their opponent but time-limit rules, often highly restrictive, moved the cut and thrust on before either was prepared to concede the point or both could agree on central facts. We’ve revisited five of the biggest clangers of the second debate to sort fact from fiction. On aged care, there was a pair of howlers from the leaders, both seeking to grab credit for the royal commission. Morrison declared “I was the one who blew the whistle”, in reference to calling the royal commission in September 2018. That seems like a gross embellishment, when the abuses and neglect in aged care were already well known at the time, particularly through reporting on the Oakden aged care centre in South Australia, which had already been examined by a Senate inquiry. Albanese responded that the government had called a royal commission “under pressure from the Labor party” which “took it to elections”. “You did it reluctantly because you lost the numbers on the floor of the parliament,” he said. Albanese appears to have been mistakenly referring to the banking royal commission, which Labor took to the 2016 election and several government MPs threatened to support before the Turnbull government reluctantly called one in November 2017. Although the Coalition did resist the aged care royal commission for many months, Labor never took the policy to an election, and the then leader, Bill Shorten, declined to support one in June 2018, just months before it was called. Asked if he had ever seen any corruption on his side of politics, Morrison boldly responded: “No, I haven’t.” Panellist David Crowe gave a quick example: the New South Wales branch funnelling donations through the Free Enterprise Foundation to subvert state donations laws. Morrison replied that the question assumed he had “some knowledge or awareness or involvement in those issues”. So, provided a politician doesn’t read front-page news stories alleging corruption in their own party, they can say they’ve never seen it. Right. That’s before one gets to the $100m sports rorts saga and $660m for commuter car parks – both blasted by the auditor general, with the car parks scheme described as “amount[ing] to corruption” by a former New South Wales auditor general during a Senate inquiry. Albanese also overreached by claiming “oppositions don’t draft legislation, governments do”. He was on firmer footing claiming there would have been no point in doing so, because the government wouldn’t allow a Labor bill to be voted on or debated. Early on, Chris Uhlmann challenged Albanese over whether it was a lie to claim he “wasn’t given the opportunity” to give the six points of Labor’s NDIS policy. Albanese replied: “No, it wasn’t.” At a media conference on Thursday, Albanese was interrupted several times when asked for the six points, because his answer was not directly responsive to the question. Albanese said the six points were “outlined by Bill Shorten” and “all around the theme of putting people at the centre of the NDIS”. But, ultimately, Albanese chose to give the call to another journalist despite being asked four times for the points. It is not true to say he wasn’t given the opportunity to answer. Albanese said when Morrison was a minister the Port of Darwin was “sold to a company with links to the Chinese Communist party”. When Morrison responded that the commonwealth had no role, Albanese said it was his party – the Country Liberal party in the Northern Territory – who had sold it and Morrison had “ticked it off”. Morrison is correct that the Foreign Investment Review Board did not have direct power to veto the deal but federal agencies including the defence department and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation could have raised concerns, and did not. The commonwealth has legislative power to override territory governments, and later gave itself powers to veto deals with sub-national governments that don’t fit Australia’s foreign policy – which could now be used to reverse the deal. Morrison started the debate by saying Australia had “faced down 15% unemployment”. As Treasury officials told the Senate Covid committee in April 2020, unemployment was projected to reach 10% by mid 2020, 5% lower than it might have been without jobkeeper wage subsidies. In fact, unemployment peaked at 7.5% in July 2020. So while it’s true that Australia faced down the prospect of 15% unemployment, it is an exaggeration based on a projected scenario. Note that when the government claims it saved 40,000 lives from Covid, it is measuring itself against the OECD average, not worst case projections like 50,000 to 150,000 possible deaths in Australia. The same should apply for unemployment.",News/Australia news,Second leaders’ debate factcheck: the five biggest clangers in Morrison v Albanese,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/09/second-leaders-debate-factcheck-the-five-biggest-clangers-in-morrison-v-albanese
5/9/2022,"Nationals minister Bridget McKenzie has refused to say whether the junior Coalition partner would block any increased ambition on climate policy in the event Scott Morrison attempted to form a minority government with the support of teal independents after 21 May. Despite facing multiple questions about the Nationals’ position on the ABC on Monday morning, McKenzie declined to be candid about whether or not her party would accept any increase in the government’s widely criticised medium term emissions reduction target. While the Nationals ended up signing on to Morrison’s commitment of net zero emissions by 2050, MPs remain publicly split on the target, with Matt Canavan characterising the pledge to the United Nations as “dead” and the Nationals’ candidate in Flynn characterising net zero as a flexible non-binding plan that leaves plenty of “wiggle room”. During last year’s Nationals party room debate on net zero, the party leader, Barnaby Joyce, made it clear to colleagues he didn’t support the mid-century target. The Nationals also vetoed Morrison’s attempt to increase the 2030 target in the run-up to the Glasgow climate conference last year. Asked whether the Nationals would flex their muscle post-election to block more ambitious Coalition climate policy commitments in return for undertakings from the cross bench about confidence and supply, McKenzie stepped around the point: “We are committed to moving towards net zero by 2050”. “We are looking forward to the opportunities that will provide our communities,” she said. “At the end of the day rural and regional Australia, and this has been I think they thing that has been forgotten for the decade of the so-called climate wars is it was always going to be the regions that ended up paying the price”. “We’ve been able to broker an outcome because the Liberal and National parties work together, unlike the Labor party”. Pressed on whether the Nationals would countenance a change in the Coalition’s medium-term emissions reduction target to stay in government, McKenzie declared: “I’m not dealing in hypotheticals”. This is not a hypothetical. As pre-poll voting opened on Monday, the latest opinion polls have Labor in front of the government, but strategists on both sides think there is a significant risk of a hung parliament given polls also suggest a chunk of voters are looking to support a candidate from outside the major parties. The teal independents have been entirely clear that want a more ambitious medium-term emissions reduction target in the event any of them making it to parliament. McKenzie avoided answering the question by reverting to a Coalition talking point. “The prime minister has made it very very clear the worst outcome for our nation is a hung parliament and the last time a minority government was formed with rural independents it decimated the regions on a whole range of policy fronts,” she said. “It is not the best outcome”. McKenzie’s contention about the decimation of regional electorates during the last minority parliament is incorrect. During the 43rd parliament, the two rural independents McKenzie cited – Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott – delivered significant new investments in their northern New South Wales regions courtesy of concessions extracted from Labor in return for their support in confidence and supply votes. The two faced a backlash in their regions for supporting a Labor government, not for failing to deliver infrastructure and services for their communities. McKenzie on Monday sought to diminish the climate focused independents with a sexist slur. She characterised the teal independents – all women – as “Simon Holmes à Court’s groupies”. Holmes à Court runs the Climate 200 group which has raised funds to help bankroll some of the political campaigns against incumbent Liberals in the major cities. Challenged on the sexist slur, McKenzie said she noted the independents didn’t want to be called a political party. “I’m very very happy to call them Simon Homes à Court’s political party if you like”. A key attack line in the teal campaigns is it is pointless to support moderate Liberals, like Dave Sharma or Trent Zimmerman, because ultimately they vote the same way as Barnaby Joyce. McKenzie was asked whether the Nationals’ longstanding obduracy on climate action was actually a key contributor to the rise of the climate-focussed independents. The Nationals’ minister suggested that wasn’t a factor. “We’ve been able to broker a fantastic result around climate change, actually bringing the regions, which would have been the communities adversely affected by decarbonisation, by net zero – we’ve been able to develop plans for rural and regional Australians that they’ll be able to seize the opportunities that net zero by 2050 will provide them,” she said. “We’re absolutely focused on fighting for a number one against a Liberal if you’ve got a Liberal candidate in your electorate and a number one if you’ve got a National.",News/Australia news,Bridget McKenzie won’t say whether Nationals would block stronger climate targets in minority negotiations,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/09/bridget-mckenzie-wont-say-whether-nationals-would-block-stronger-climate-targets-in-minority-negotiations
