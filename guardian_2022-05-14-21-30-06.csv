5/14/2022,"Back in 2016, Sarah Perry’s second novel, The Essex Serpent, went from well-received to word-of-mouth bestseller to award winner. Now, the Victorian gothic tale about a mysterious creature haunting Essex (no, not Eddie Hearn) has ascended to the highest possible plane: the lavish TV adaptation. The six-part series launched on Apple TV+ on 13 May. Leaving behind her expansive Homeland mind maps, Claire Danes plays Cora, a widow who departs Victorian London for a village near the Blackwater estuary, only to get dragged into local intrigue involving a terrifying folktale coming to life. Tom Hiddleston stars as Will, the man trying to keep the beast at bay. Hiddleston has always bounced confidently between prestige TV, indie film and Marvel blockbusters but – before he started dancing and singing in numerous public settings, or decided to do an average impression of Robert De Niro to his face! – he appeared in Jim Jarmusch’s strange, beguiling, existential vampire film Only Lovers Left Alive. In 1986, Jarmusch released his third film, Down By Law, a strange, beguiling existential jailbreak movie. One Claire Denis worked on it as an assistant director – the Frenchwoman would go on to be a master director in her own right, with the likes of Chocolat and Beau Travail. The Cannes film festival opens on Tuesday and Denis’ latest, The Stars at Noon, is among those vying for the Palme d’Or. The Stars at Noon features Joe Alwyn, who also appears in BBC Three’s Conversations With Friends, starting on 15 May. Alwyn is also Taylor Swift’s “London boy”; it was love. But long before that, Swift was in an odd showmance with Tom Hiddleston; he has the T-shirt to show for it, but now will be seen in The Essex Serpent’s Victorian garb. Watch Essex Serpent director Clio Barnard came to prominence with her experimental film The Arbor about troubled Bradford playwright Andrea Dunbar, author of such classic modern dramas as Rita, Sue and Bob Too.

5/14/2022,"When Tonina Torrielli represented Italy in the Eurovision song contest in Lugano, Switzerland, in May 1956, not only did she never discover how well her song performed, as just the winner was announced after a secret vote, but she was not even aware she was taking part in the first edition of what was to become the biggest music competition in the world. “They packed me off, just like a parcel, to Lugano, without saying what it was for,” said Torrielli, who lives in Turin, where the 66th Eurovision song contest is taking place. “So I went and sang and that was that, I didn’t know it was the first European song contest as nobody was talking about it.” Her career singing in music competitions lasted until the mid-1960s when she opened a music shop called Maschio on Piazza Castello in the centre of Turin with her late husband, Mario Maschio, who was a drummer. The shop also became famous, and for the next four decades was the place to go for music aficionados. “Even today, people come and ask: ‘Where is Maschio?’” said Shpetim Xhani, a concierge at the building next door. “It was very well known; people came from everywhere as you could find every kind of music there.” Maschio may be gone – a clothes shop has replaced it – but music fever is very much in the air as Piazza Castello and other squares and parks around Turin fill with buskers and local musical acts in the leadup to the Eurovision grand final on Saturday. “There’s a really lovely atmosphere,” said Dino Ricchiuti, who was playing his saxophone steps away from Maschio, where he used to shop for musical equipment. “After two years of the pandemic, which caused a lot of bands to stop working, Turin has sprung back to life.” Italy is hosting Eurovision for the first time in 31 years after the glam pop band Måneskin won the 2021 edition with a showstopping performance of Zitti e buoni. The band from Rome have enjoyed phenomenal success since, including supporting the Rolling Stones at a concert in the US in November. Måneskin’s victory, along with the fact that Italy is this year’s host, has helped revive the contest in a country that has withdrawn from the event on numerous occasions over the last 66 years, citing lack of interest. In 1974, Rai, the state broadcaster, censored the competition over fears that the title of Italy’s song, Si, sung by Gigliola Cinquetti, who was Italy’s first Eurovision winner in 1964, might have given a nod to the public to vote yes in support of a forthcoming referendum on divorce. Italy last withdrew from the competition in 1997, returning in 2011. Now the country is the most successful among the “big five” automatic qualifiers, along with France, Germany, Spain and the UK, after finishing in the top 10 in eight of the last 10 contests. Mahmood, who came second in 2019, is again competing this year, singing Brividi, a classic Italian ballad, in duet with Blanco. “It’s hard to compare this contest with the last one, although we’re very happy to be representing Italy on home soil,” said Mahmood. “We’re really ready for it, and hope to give it our best so that our music gets better known abroad.” Torrielli got her big break singing competitively in the Sanremo music festival, which began a few years earlier and was the inspiration behind the Eurovision song contest. Still wildly popular in Italy today, whoever wins Sanremo goes on to sing for the country at Eurovision. Torrielli, nicknamed “Candy Girl” because she worked in a sweet factory, became an overnight sensation when she beat more than 6,400 hopefuls from across Italy to earn a place among the 15 who competed in the Sanremo festival in March 1956. “The owner of the factory would hear me singing opera songs, and so pushed me to take part,” said Torrielli, 88. Her song, Amami se vuoi, came second, but because the first Eurovision allowed two songs for each of the seven countries that participated, Torrielli represented Italy along with that year’s Sanremo winner, Franca Raimondi. Torrielli again competed in Sanremo, coming third in 1957 and second in 1958, and travelled the world to take part in other music festivals. Federico Capitoni, a journalist and music critic, said Eurovision had become more fashionable in Italy, mostly thanks to Måneskin, but Sanremo still ruled the roost. “If you think about who’s participated at Eurovision in the past, nobody remembers who they are,” he said. Not quite true. Torrielli, who spoke from hospital, where she had had an operation after a recent accident, still receives fan mail. There is also a page dedicated to her on Facebook, where supporters share clips of her songs. Surprisingly, however, she is not such a big fan of her own music. “If you asked me the lyrics to my own songs, I wouldn’t remember,” she said. “But ask me to sing the likes of Mi chiamano mimi [by Puccini], I know them all by heart as opera is the music I love.”",Arts/Television & radio,Italy’s Tonina Torrielli: ‘I didn’t know I was singing at the first Eurovision’,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/14/italy-tonina-torrielli-first-eurovision-song-contest
5/14/2022,"Modern nutritional science is only a hundred years old, so it’s no surprise that we’re constantly bamboozled by new and competing information about what to put into our bodies – or that we sometimes cling to reassuringly straightforward food myths which may no longer be true. In a world where official dietary advice seems to change all the time, and online opinions are loud and often baseless, we ask eight food and drink experts to cut through the noise and tell it like it is. “I’m surprised that people still think coffee is bad for them,” says Dr Astrid Nehlig, research director of the French medical research institute, Inserm, and one of the world’s leading researchers into coffee, health and brain function. When she first started researching coffee 30 years ago, she often encountered producers who were nervous that their products might be found to be harmful. “But a lot of progress has been made in the last 10-15 years.” So what do we know, now? “Coffee contains more than 1,000 compounds, so what we are looking at is not just about caffeine,” says Nehlig. “It increases alertness but at the same time relaxes us. It focuses and increases attention, but prevents sleep, especially if you drink too much, or too late.” We are not all equal on this front: caffeine targets our brain’s adenosine receptors but half of us are immune to this effect – which explains all those people who drink espresso after dinner and conk out at 11pm. “It’s also about the accumulation of caffeine during the day, which is related to how we metabolise caffeine – in one group of the population, caffeine builds up in the body, but the other group eliminates it very quickly.” Nehlig adds: “Coffee has often been accused of being bad for heart health. But we now have global research showing that coffeeit is protective against cardiovascular disease, stroke and coronary heart disease, and decreases mortality linked to cardiovascular issues.” Nehlig says there is also clear evidence that coffee protects against type 2 diabetes, regardless of body fat; it’s definitely protective against Parkinson’s disease and almost certainly against cognitive decline in general. Coffee does not increase our risk of cancer. “It’s neutral, or even protective in some cancers, like the liver, colon, endometrium and some non-hormonally dependent breast cancers.” Quite why this is, isn’t yet known; Nehlig’s hunch is that it’s to do with coffee’s range of antioxidants. This isn’t a licence to knock back as many flat whitesas possible, though. “Research shows adults shouldn’t go over 400mg a day, which is 4-5 small cups, and no more than 200mg in one sitting.” (Coffees from high-street chains can contain as much as 300mg in a large serving.) “For some people caffeine will either trigger anxiety or worsen symptoms of anxiety,” says Murray Carpenter, author of Caffeinated: How Our Daily Habit Hooks, Helps and Hurts Us. “Some who really suffer from anxiety have never experimented with eliminating or minimising caffeine.” (My own anxiety got so bad that I had to give up caffeine during the worst of the pandemic in 2020. I still miss it.) Caffeine also worsens insomnia. “In both scenarios, I think it’s important that people experiment with changing their caffeine habits and see what improves,” says Carpenter. It won’t be a silver bullet for everyone. “But if you don’t experiment, you won’t know.” “Are plant milks highly processed foods? Yes: they are,” says Dr Duane Mellor, registered dietitian, British Dietetics Association spokesperson and senior teaching fellow at Aston Medical School. “There is a massive green and health halo attached to plant-based foods, which is not necessarily informed by the composition of the foods themselves. Do we know if the same outcomes are as likely for people eating other highly processed foods, like loads of bacon sandwiches? Not yet.” As Mellor points out, the research hasn’t yet been done but it will also be hard to analyse, because people consuming plant-based dairy replacements may tend towards a diet lower in other highly processed products (although ultra-processed meat and cheese replacements are a growth area), and may share other demographic qualities that place them in generally healthier groups. “It’s OK if you want to use them to whiten your coffee, but I wouldn’t rely on them as a major source of nutrition,” he says. Mellor would prefer people choose, for example, naturally vegan desserts, rather than readymade desserts made with plant-based dairy replacements. “We are a bit over-reliant on dairy as a source of protein,” says Mellor, but the solution may not be plant-based replacements, which, apart from soy, don’t contain much protein, anyway – almond milk can be as little as only 2% nut, giving it just 1g of protein per 100ml, similar to oat, whereas dairy milk contains about 3.5g of protein per 100ml. Most milk alternatives contain added nutrients to mimic those in cow’s milk (although usually not the iodine that we mainly get from dairy), but organic plant milks are rarely fortified. What about the emulsifiers and stabilisers in milk replacements, which some scientists think could destabilise the bacteria in the gut? “The evidence isn’t strong yet,” says Mellor. Lots of foods naturally emulsify, like egg yolk and mustard, so they’re not intrinsically bad. “But there are some synthetic ones which – possibly because they are synthetic – may interfere with the gut microbiome, which then has a theoretical impact on health. People get a bit worried about stabilisers such as carrageenan [from seaweed] and xanthan gum [from fermented sugar]. When you extract these compounds and put them into a food product, do they behave differently than when they are in the natural food? We don’t know. It’s all theoretical.” Surely it’s good to avoid the saturated fat in dairy? “The main source of saturated fats in the British diet is baked goods – pies, biscuits and cakes – and these processed foods, which are high in fat, refined carbohydrate and salt, may be more of a problem than dairy. Some saturated fats uniquely in dairy may actually reduce risk of heart disease: fermented dairy such as unsweetened yoghurt and some cheeses probably reduce risk, milk is neutral and butter perhaps slightly increases it.” If plant-based dairy substitutes aren’t great, nutritionally, what about other kinds of milk? Goats and sheep lactate for a shorter time than cows, meaning more offspring are needed to generate milk – raising even more ethical and sustainability issues than cow’s milk already does. For some people, goat and sheep milks seem to be easier on the gut. “It’s a controversial area, but sheep and goat milk have less-to-no A1 beta casein which have been claimed to make them easier to digest. (This is different to lactose – all contain lactose.) But evidence from studies is not supportive.” “It’s vital people ensure they are getting adequate sources of important micronutrients,” says Professor Barbara Ryan, gastroenterologist, clinical professor of gastroenterology at Trinity College Dublin and one of the Gut Experts. She recommends taking vitamin D to protect bone health, regardless of dairy consumption. “We have diagnosed young women in their 30s and 40s with osteoporosis as a result of cutting out dairy in their 20s and not ensuring that they were getting adequate calcium from other sources. A couple of pregnancies, followed by breastfeeding, increased their requirement for calcium, and this simply was not met by their diet.” “There is no good evidence that red wine is good for you,” says Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, liver specialist and chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance UK. The original claim that it might be is partly based on resveratrol, a polyphenol in wine which may be associated with good health outcomes, particularly cardiovascular – but in quantities far higher than those found in a couple of glasses of rioja. “A therapeutic amount of resveratrol would only be found in pints of red wine,” says Gilmore. “Often this comes from mouse studies,” says Dr Sadie Boniface, head of research at the Institute for Alcohol Studies. “They give mice a really high dose of polyphenols which could be the equivalent of 100 bottles of wine in one go. Polyphenols are not unique to red wine: they are found in blueberries and other dark fruits, so it doesn’t make sense to say you need to drink red wine to get the health benefits. We know that alcohol causes about 200 medical conditions: you can’t drink to get the benefits without also increasing your risk of other types of diseases.” The World Heart Federation published a research summary and policy brief in January which showed that alcohol is definitely not good for cardiovascular health. Another reason for this myth’s persistence relates to how non-drinkers and moderate drinkers are compared in some research (sometimes quietly funded by the alcohol industry). “There’s this idea that moderate drinking is good for you and that you live longer than if you don’t drink at all,” says Boniface. “But the best research looks in detail at other aspects of people’s lives and has found that it’s not the moderate amount of red wine that is good for you, it’s other health behaviours. So you might have a good diet and life circumstances – you’re not living in poverty, breathing in lots of pollution – and those behaviours and lifestyles cluster in people who are moderate drinkers: they’re people who are living healthier lives. That’s why they live longer. Not because there’s a sweet spot in terms of how much alcohol you should drink.” And how do they compare with abstainers? “About one in five adults don’t drink, and there’s lots of research to show that they are on average in worse health than people who are moderate drinkers. Maybe they have another health condition or they are on a medication that would interact with alcohol, but those people have typically worse health outcomes on average. So moderate drinkers then artificially look healthier.” Neither Gilmore nor Boniface want to come across as killjoys. “I’m not advocating for everyone to be teetotal,” says Gilmore. “I’m sure public health experts do drink alcohol,” says Boniface. “There’s the more social-cultural side of alcohol, the fact that people enjoy drinking and it’s a huge part of our society and the way we socialise. Those other sides shouldn’t be ignored. But nobody should ever be drinking because they think it’s good for them,” she adds. For Gilmore, the public health message on alcohol isn’t entirely about individuals, but about reducing the general burden on the NHS. “People think that the most harm comes from people drinking two bottles of gin a day, but actually the bulk happens among people drinking 20-40 units of alcohol a week – because there are so many of them.” “Red meat has become the villain of the piece,” says Rob Percival, author of The Meat Paradox: Eating, Empathy and the Future of Meat, head of policy research at the Soil Association and an expert in the politics of meat. “And chicken and white meat have been given a free pass, alongside plants. But there’s nuance in the science, which isn’t often communicated in the press and is lost in the debate on social media,” he says. Some observational studies have indeed suggested that red meat is associated with various lifestyle-related diseases (a meta analysis published in 2021, for example, found a correlation between red meat eating and a wide range of cancers), “but those studies have found that association more in populations consuming a highly processed, western-style diet”. Plus many of the studies lump red meat in with processed meat, despite them being very different foods. “Unpicking the role of meat relative to other factors is actually quite complicated,” says Percival. “There’s a body of evidence which shows that if you’re eating a healthy omnivorous diet with lots of plants, then that association is nullified: red meat isn’t contributing to premature mortality. The overall picture seems to be that red meat can play a helpful role in addressing deficiencies in micronutrients [such as zinc, vitamin B12 and potassium]. It’s not the villain it’s made out to be, specifically in relation to cancer. The World Health Organization found that there was a good body of evidence associating processed meats with a higher risk of cancer, and a slightly looser body of evidence associating it with red meat, but they acknowledged that red meat can play a healthy role in the diet and that there were ambiguities in the science.” What’s less ambiguous is the question of quantity. The NHS says that a diet is high in red (and processed meat) if you eat more than 90g a day, and that cutting down to 70g (averaged out across the week) is lower risk, along with having weekly meat-free days. Seventy grams may equate to less than you’d think: 490g (70g x 7 days) means in one week you could eat just one steak (225g), two pork sausages (140g) and a quarter of a pack of mince (125g); not a lot for the average meat eater. “Carbohydrates are made up of simple sugars or chains of sugars, and are a major source of energy,” says Elaine McGowan, clinical dietitian, co-author of What Every Woman Needs to Know About Her Gut, and the other half of the Gut Experts. “Simple sugars contain glucose which is rapidly absorbed from the gut into the bloodstream. This rush of glucose causes a spike in insulin, which in turn causes a glut of glucose to be taken up into the body’s cells. The cells don’t generally need this rush of glucose for immediate use and so the glucose is stored, and some is converted to fat.” This is why carbs are associated with rising levels of obesity, as well as diseases including type 2 diabetes. But that doesn’t mean all carbs are bad (almost no food is entirely good, nor entirely bad; it just depends on how much of it we eat). Instead, we could limit simple carbs – “‘white’ foods including white cereals, breads, crackers, flour, sugar, biscuits, cakes, confectionery, juices and sweetened drinks”, says McGowan – and eat complex carbs instead, which are found in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts and seeds. “Complex carbohydrates are made up of long, branched chains of sugars which take quite a bit of time to digest in the small intestine. The sugars are absorbed much more slowly into the bloodstream. As a result, insulin levels do not spike quickly and the sugar is taken up by the body’s cells in a controlled way, more closely matching their energy needs, so less sugar is converted into fat or stored in other ways. Complex carbohydrates are high in fibre, low in fat, very filling, feed your gut microbiota and contain important vitamins and minerals.” As with all things, moderation is key. “One potential downside we see, is that some people are now eating too much fibre (the daily recommended amount is 20g-35g a day) and this can trigger gut symptoms.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Coffee bad, red wine good?

5/14/2022,"Boris Johnson said 50 migrants have been told they will be sent to Rwanda within the next fortnight, and insisted he was ready to fight with “leftie lawyers” seeking to challenge the government’s plans. Under the £120m scheme announced last month, people deemed to have entered the UK unlawfully will be transported to the east African country, where they will be allowed to apply for the right to settle. The plans have faced widespread criticism from human rights charities and even some Tory backbenchers, including the former prime minister Theresa May, as well as the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. However, in an interview with the Daily Mail, Johnson remained defiant, stating that the first 50 “illegal entrants into this country” have already been served notice that they will be sent to the African country within a fortnight. “There’s going to be a lot of legal opposition from the types of firms that, for a long time, have been taking taxpayers’ money to mount these sorts of cases, and to thwart the will of the people, the will of parliament. We’re ready for that,” he said. “We will dig in for the fight and, you know, we will make it work. We’ve got a huge flowchart of things we have to do to deal with it, with the leftie lawyers.” When asked if he may respond with a review of the European convention on human rights, Johnson said: “We’ll look at everything. Nothing is off the table.” The Home Office published its own equality impact assessment for the policy this week, and said there are “concerns” over the treatment of some LGBTQI+ people in the east African country. It said investigations point to “ill treatment” of this group being “more than one-off”. Tom Pursglove, the minister for justice and tackling illegal immigration, said decisions to transport asylum seekers to Rwanda would be considered on a “case-by-case basis” and did not deny that people fleeing war in Ukraine could be among them. Pursglove said: “There is absolutely no reason why any Ukrainian should be getting in a small boat, paying a smuggler to get to the UK.” He was also unable to point to any calculations that the government’s Rwanda relocation policy will reduce the number of people arriving in the UK by small boats. “This is a new and untested policy at this point in time,” he said. “I do think that, in the fullness of time, we will see this policy, as part of a wider package that we are introducing, really shift the dynamic.” When challenged on human rights concerns surrounding the policy during a home affairs select committee hearing Pursglove said that “overall, Rwanda is a safe and secure country” to use for resettlement. He argued there were “no systematic breaches” of human rights obligations in the east African country. After the announcement of the government’s relocation scheme, more than 160 charities and campaign groups called on the prime minister to scrap what they described as “shamefully cruel” plans. The archbishop of Canterbury used his Easter sermon to question the move, saying there were “serious ethical questions about sending asylum seekers overseas”. May, herself a former home secretary, said she did not support the idea “on the grounds of legality, practicality and efficacy”.",News/UK news,"Fifty migrants to be sent to Rwanda in a fortnight, says Boris Johnson",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/14/fifty-migrants-to-be-sent-from-uk-to-rwanda-in-a-fortnight-says-boris-johnson
5/14/2022,"Only 7% of primary schoolchildren in England have received a first dose of Covid vaccine six weeks after it was rolled out to all 5- to 11-year-olds, as parents grapple with the decision about whether to take up the offer. That rate compares with 24% of 12- to 15-year-olds who had received a first dose in the first six weeks after they became eligible in September 2021. Scientists say the lower take-up among primary schoolchildren is due to a perception that Covid poses little risk to younger children. Some parents have been concerned about the risk of rare side-effects from the vaccine. But according to Professor Russell Viner of University College London, who was part of the now-disbanded Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, they should be reassured by the near absence of side-effects after widespread take-up in the US, which approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine last November. “It’s a vaccination that probably isn’t particularly beneficial for this age group,” Viner said. “However, it has a very, very good safety profile. And given that we remain in a pandemic, there’s an argument that for individual parents, the balance of risks would appear to be towards vaccination.” Viner said he was most concerned that children in vulnerable groups received the vaccine. “The benefits for the whole healthy population [of 5- to 11-year-olds] are particularly around a reduction in school disruption, and the prevention of onward transmission to others,” he said. “However, for Omicron, the vaccines are pretty poor at preventing onward transmission. So I think the benefits of vaccination for this age group are very marginal. But that’s different for those who are highly clinically vulnerable. They are vulnerable to any respiratory virus and Covid is more serious than others.” The area with the largest vaccine take-up for 5- to 11-year-olds was Oxfordshire, with 12%, while Knowsley in Merseyside had the fewest, with 3%, according to the latest NHS vaccine data up to 8 May. “All the data on vaccine uptake shows very significant inequalities,” Viner said. “So it will be those children who are in the more clinically vulnerable groups from the more deprived parts of the population who I would be most worried about.” Dr Peter English, a retired consultant in communicable disease control and former chair of the BMA Public Health Medicine Committee, said that parents should be aware that a significant proportion of children go on to develop long Covid. “Some will sustain damage to their organs or immune system that could leave them still unwell months or years after infection.” He said it was unclear whether vaccination would protect children from long Covid, although it may do so because vaccination reduces the risk of severe disease and therefore reduces rates of organ damage. Emma Amoscato and her family discussed vaccinations for some time before pressing ahead with getting doses for her two children, aged 9 and 6. “We had a conversation – ‘would we, wouldn’t we’ – when America started offering jabs,” said Amoscato, who is the founder of the Smile mental health app. “Is the risk to the children that great, should we be putting something in their bodies? “In the end, it made sense to do it. We’re both triple vaccinated. My husband is clinically vulnerable. And it wasn’t the risk to life – it was the risk to the children of developing long Covid and what that would mean for them, living with a long-term chronic illness.” Chloe Haywood, a designer in Somerset, decided to get the vaccine for her three sons, aged 11, 8 and 5, after the household had fallen ill with Covid. “They all had jabs when they were babies,” she said. “It was more a question of how fast we could get them booked in.” Some parents had been concerned about the risk of long Covid before the latest rollout, and attempted to have their children vaccinated overseas. An NHS spokesperson said: “Getting vaccinated is a personal choice between families and their children, and we have now sent invites to everyone eligible, providing parents with information to allow them to make an informed decision, while they can also talk to their doctor or a local healthcare professional if they have questions.”",News/World news,Only 7% of 5-11s in England have had Covid jab as parents hesitate ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/14/young-children-england-covid-jab-vaccine-rollout-7-per-cent-parents-usefulness
