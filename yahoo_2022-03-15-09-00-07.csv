3/15/2022,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A Mexican man acquitted of murder in the 2015 shooting of a woman on a San Francisco pier that became a national flashpoint over immigration pleaded guilty Monday to federal gun charges. Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 51, entered his plea nearly seven years after shooting Kate Steinle on July 1, 2015, while she walked on the crowded waterfront. The case helped fuel a fierce national debate on immigration and sanctuary cities, which limit local cooperation with federal immigration authorities. In late 2017, a San Francisco Superior Court jury acquitted Garcia Zarate of various charges including murder. But shortly after his acquittal, federal prosecutors charged him with two counts of illegal gun possession. The federal gun charges had been pending since 2017 after U.S. District Court Judge Vince Chhabria raised concerns about Garcia Zarate's mental capacities. Two doctors diagnosed Garcia Zarate with schizophrenia and found him unfit to stand trial because he couldn't follow the court proceedings. One of the doctors reported to the court last month that Garcia Zarate was competent to stand trial after regularly taking his medication. On Monday, Chhabria asked Garcia Zarate to summarize the charges against him as a way to confirm his competency. “The charges are because I was in the country illegally and I had a firearm,” Garcia Zarate said in Spanish through a court interpreter. Garcia Zarate had been deported five times and was wanted for a sixth deportation proceeding when he fatally shot Steinle, 32. He acknowledged holding the gun that killed Steinle but said it fired accidentally when he found it wrapped in a T-shirt under a bench on Pier 15, where she was walking with her father. The shooting turned into a major campaign issue in multiple national and local races across the country. President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to the shooting during his 2016 campaign to bolster his argument for tougher immigration policies and his opposition to so-called sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with immigration officials. Garcia Zarate faces a maximum of 10 years in prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 6.",U.S./Associated Press,Mexican man acquitted of murder pleads guilty to gun charges,https://news.yahoo.com/mexican-man-acquitted-murder-pleads-223209729.html
3/15/2022,"The video shows a Russian missile launcher sitting in the open. Suddenly, it is enveloped in a huge fireball. Ukrainian officials say what looked like a video game was actually the work of a small, relatively cheap Turkish-made drone that has had a surprisingly lethal impact on Russia forces. A U.S. defense official said Monday that Ukraine has made “terrific” use of Turkish Bayraktar TB2 unmanned aerial vehicles, which can loiter over tanks and artillery and destroy them with devastatingly accurate missile fire. The official said the U.S. is working to help keep the drones flying. Ukraine received a new shipment of the drones this month, Ukraine’s defense minister said on Facebook. He didn’t say how many. It’s unclear whether the U.S. has made efforts to facilitate the supply of the Turkish drone or other similar systems to Ukraine, in addition to the Javelin anti-tank and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles it is providing. Before the war began, military experts predicted that Russian forces would have little trouble dealing with Ukraine’s complement of as many as 20 Turkish drones. With a price tag in the single-digit millions, the Bayraktars are far cheaper than drones like the U.S. Reaper but also much slower and smaller, with a wingspan of 39 feet. As so often has been the case in this war, however, the experts misjudged the competence of the Russian military. “It’s quite startling to see all these videos of Bayraktars apparently knocking out Russian surface-to-air missile batteries, which are exactly the kind of system that’s equipped to shoot them down,” said David Hambling, a London-based drone expert. That is confounding, Hambling said, because the drones should be easy for the Russians to blow out of the sky — or disable with electronic jamming. “It is literally a World War I aircraft, in terms of performance,” he said. “It’s got a 110-horsepower engine. It is not stealthy. It is not supersonic. It’s a clay pigeon — a real easy target.” If nothing else, the Russians should be able to down the drones with fighter jets, Hambling said. But without air superiority, Russia hasn’t been flying regular combat air patrols. As for electronic jamming, one of the mysteries of the Ukraine invasion is why the Russians haven’t made more use of what experts believe is their advanced electronic warfare capability. The bottom line is that the Turkish drones continue to star in videos shared across Twitter and other social media platforms that feature them blowing Russian vehicles to smithereens. Ukrainians have even praised them in song. It’s unclear how many have been shot down, but some, at least, remain effective, U.S. officials said. “It is puzzling,” Hambling said. “It may be massive incompetence by the Russians. It may be that the Ukrainians have discovered some sneaky tactics they can use.” It’s hardly the first time the Bayraktar has played an important role in an armed conflict. Azerbaijan used small Turkish-made drones to devastating effect against the Armenian military in 2020, bringing a decisive end to a stalemate over a disputed enclave that had gone on for years. Video released by Azerbaijan shows the drones pummeling artillery, tank and troop emplacements surrounded by trenches that offered no protection whatsoever from the fiery death raining down from above. The Turkish drones also had a significant impact in battles against Russian-made military gear in Libya and Syria. The drones are manufactured by Baykar Technology, whose chief technology officer, Selçuk Bayraktar, is a son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. “I’m sure it’s going to be selling extremely well,” Hambling said. Many experts have argued that another type of unmanned weapons system would be even more helpful to Ukrainian forces: a so-called kamikaze drone, a vehicle packed with explosives that is essentially a smart guided missile launched miles away from a target. Two Israeli companies make versions of those drones, the Harop and the Hero. The U.S. military fields a system called the Switchblade, the larger version of which can destroy tanks. That weapon isn’t approved for export except to the U.K. Turkey, which has sought to maintain friendly relations with both Russia and the West, was sanctioned by the U.S. in December 2020 over its purchase of Russian S-400 missile defense systems. Erdoğan declined to say Monday whether Turkey would buy more Russian weapons. “Under the current circumstances, it would be premature to talk about what the future shows right now,” he said Monday during a visit to Germany, according to Reuters. “We have to see what the conditions bring. We have to maintain our friendship with Mr. Zelenskyy and Mr. Putin.”",World/NBC News,"Why are Ukraine’s cheap, slow drones so successful against Russian targets?",https://news.yahoo.com/why-ukraine-cheap-slow-drones-205933257.html
3/15/2022,"Roman Abramovich's private jet flew from Israel to Istanbul on Monday, flight tracking data indicates. The UK froze the Chelsea FC owner's assets last week as part of sanctions against Russian oligarchs. Abramovich has citizenship in Israel, where planes owned by other oligarchs have landed. A private jet said to be owned by the sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich flew from Moscow to Israel to Istanbul on Monday, according to multiple reports. Data from flight-tracking website Flightradar24 showed Abramovich's plane make the short trip from Tel Aviv across the Mediterranean Sea earlier on Monday. Reuters reported that the jet left from Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport. Monday's flight to Turkey comes a day after the Gulfstream G650ER jet with the registration LX-RAY took off from Moscow on Sunday afternoon and landed in Tel Aviv in the evening, data from Flightradar24 indicates. The flight to Istanbul lasted a little under two hours, while the flight to Tel Aviv lasted 5 1/2 hours, the Flightradar24 data shows. It's unclear whether Abramovich was onboard. The jet had previously flown to Moscow from Istanbul on Saturday, the Flightradar24 data indicates. Various reports have identified Abramovich as the owner of the plane. A Twitter user who made headlines tracking Elon Musk's jet and now tracks the whereabouts of jets owned by Russian billionaires has also identified Abramovich as the jet's owner. Gulfstream says its G650ER jet can seat up to 19 passengers and sleep up to 10 people. A private-jet comparison site suggests it costs $65 million. Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea Football Club, was among the seven Russian oligarchs the UK sanctioned on Thursday. The sanctions include freezing the oligarchs' assets and barring them from doing business with the country. Abramovich has an estimated net worth of $13.6 billion, according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. He announced earlier this month that he would sell Chelsea FC, but the UK's sanctions mean he can't go ahead with the sale. The billionaire was reportedly granted Israeli citizenship in 2018 after facing delays in renewing his UK visa. Over the past two weeks, at least 14 private jets from Russia are said to have landed in Israel, whose government has not sanctioned any Russian oligarchs, The Times of Israel reported.

3/15/2022,"A man was charged on Saturday for flipping a toddler’s stroller into the street in East Flushing, New York, leaving the 2-year-old with cuts and bruises to her face.

The unprovoked attack occurred on Friday around 6:20 a.m. after Christopher Elder, 31, began shouting at the child’s grandmother, Maria Zamora, while she was taking out the trash in east Flushing. According to a criminal complaint, Elder then allegedly grabbed the stroller that Sophia was sitting in and began to shake it, kicking it into the street shortly after.

The 2-year-old hit the ground after being kicked and suffered cuts to the head, requiring five stitches at the Flushing Hospital Medical Center.

Her uncle, Juan Loja, told the New York Post that the toddler is “very scared” and “didn’t want to come home yesterday.” He also said that she tells him, “Someone hit me. Someone kicked me.”

This incident is the second time that Elder has purportedly attacked a child in four months. On Dec. 11, he allegedly attacked a mother and her 9-year-old daughter in Flushing with punches to the head.

“He hit me mostly in the back of my head, my back,” the mother, who wished to remain anonymous, told NBC New York. “He ended up hitting my daughter too, in the face, on the forehead. ” Afterwards, when he was done hitting us on the floor, I was just so upset that nobody helped, nobody stopped him, and I’m even more mad that he did it again.”

Elder has been arrested eight times in total for multiple violent crimes. He previously stabbed a friend in August 2020 and was also accused of smashing a glass bottle on a 30-year-old man’s head in Queens.

Elder was charged on Saturday and sent to jail without bail. He is due in court March 28 on charges of assault, endangering the welfare of a child and harassment.

3/15/2022,"Fox News personality Rachel Campos-Duffy attempted to own the libs on Sunday only to own herself instead. During a Twitter scuffle over comments she made on Fox News, Campos-Duffy inadvertently admitted that former President Donald Trump tried to bribe Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden’s family based on unproved corruption accusations. The strong-arming attempt came while Biden was running for president against Trump. The scuffle started after Twitter user Kevin M. Kruse threw side-eye at comments made by Campos-Duffy on Fox News in which she claimed that Zelenskyy probably wished Trump were president now instead of Biden: Campos-Duffy, who was on MTV’s “Real World” reality show before becoming a Fox News personality, fired back at Kruse, but in her haste she inadvertently admitted a truth that many conservatives have tried to hide: Trump initially threatened to withhold $391 million in military aid unless Ukraine investigated Biden’s son Hunter, who had been the board of Ukrainian gas company. The scheme led to Trump’s first impeachment in December 2019. Many Twitter users were quick to point out what Campos-Duffy was admitting: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/15/2022,"American journalist and documentary filmmaker Brent Renaud has been killed in Irpin, Ukraine, according to the chief of police of Kyiv. Renaud, whose New York Times press pass and American passport were posted on social media, was a legendary filmmaker, covering some of the world’s worst human tragedies. The New York Times said in a statement that he was not on assignment for them and that their press pass with his name and photo was old. CBS News said Monday that it had confirmed Renaud was killed by Russian forces. “A 51-year-old world-renowned media correspondent was shot in Irpen today,” local police chief Andriy Nebytov posted on Facebook. “Another journalist is injured. Now they are trying to remove the victim from the war zone. Of course, the profession of a journalist is a risk, but U.S. citizen Brent Renaud paid his life for trying to highlight the aggressor’s ingenuity, cruelty and ruthlessness.” Juan Arredondo, who was traveling with Renaud during the attack and hospitalized for his injuries, told a journalist that the two had tried crossing a bridge in Irpin to film refugees leaving when they were attacked by Russian forces at a checkpoint. “We got into a car—somebody offered to take us to the other bridge, and we crossed the checkpoint and they [started] shooting at us,” Arredondo said. “So the driver turned around, and they kept shooting.” He said he saw Renaud get shot in the neck. The journalist’s death comes after days of fierce street battles in Irpin, a suburb about three miles outside Kyiv, which led to the deaths of multiple civilians. It was in Irpin where the slain bodies of a family of three—including a small child—were photographed by The New York Times, becoming a symbol for the world of the horror caused by Putin’s war. Brent and his brother Craig, working under the moniker Renaud Brothers, have won several awards for their documentary work, including a Peabody and two Columbia DuPont awards. The brothers have reported from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as natural disasters like the Haiti earthquake. He and his brother have also covered political extremism in Egypt, Libya, and across Africa. One of the Renaud brothers’ recent productions is Meth Storm, about the drug crisis in Arkansas, where they grew up. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Brent explained why they were drawn to the topic. “There’s so much judgement and analysis on people who use drugs in our culture and on social media and cable news. Our work was the reaction to that notion,” he said. “We were trying to embed ourselves in places where most people couldn’t go and allow those characters to reveal themselves to us and show context and empathy for their stories.” Renaud had taken risks from the very start of his career to bring the public stories from war zones. Here’s What Putin Doesn’t Want You to Know About What’s Happening Inside Russia Right Now He told Filmmaker magazine in 2013 that when he was just out of college he financed a trip to Cambodia and got an interview with a top general of two rival prime ministers. “On the first day filming I found myself on the wrong side of town with the wrong players, and nearly got killed when the car I was riding in busted through a military checkpoint, drawing fire on the car from the soldiers,” he said. “On another occasion I jumped on a motorbike with a translator and rode into the jungle for an interview with a villager I had managed to set up. What I failed to realize was that the subject I was to interview lived in a village still controlled by the Khmer Rouge, the brutal communist rebels who were responsible for killing one third of the entire population of the country in the 1970’s. “Things got bad enough that it required a heavily armed military—fortunately orchestrated by the general I had made friends with at the beginning of the trip.” He told the magazine that he and his brother had been in Cairo covering a crackdown of the Muslim Brotherhood. “Just pulling out video cameras on the streets there to document the demonstrations was impossible to do safely,” he said. “Twice we were attacked by thugs who did not want the brutal tactics of the military witnessed by the international media.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

3/15/2022,"By Maayan Lubell and David Gauthier-Villars JERUSALEM/ISTANBUL (Reuters) -A jet linked to sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich arrived in Istanbul from Israel on Monday, shortly after he was seen in Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport. Abramovich was among seven Russian billionaires added to a British sanctions list last week to try to isolate President Vladimir Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. European Union diplomats have embraced a similar move. The Russian oligarch, who also holds Israeli and Portuguese citizenship, has denied having close ties to Putin. A photograph obtained by Reuters showed Abramovich, the owner of Britain's Chelsea soccer club, sitting in Tel Aviv airport's VIP lounge with a face mask pulled down over his chin. Reuters could not verify whether he boarded the flight. A person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters the plane used by Abramovich flew into Ben Gurion late on Sunday from Moscow. Flight-tracking website FLIGHTRADAR24 said the aircraft, which has the tail number LX-RAY and is a large Gulfstream business jet, on Monday landed in Istanbul after leaving Israel. It was not scheduled to fly on from Istanbul after landing and remained there, according to a source citing flight plans. The plane had also been in Turkey last week, according to tracking data. Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, is the site of the head office of AB Grup Holding, a company run by Muhsin Bayrak, who has publicly expressed interest in buying Premier League club Chelsea from Abramovich. Bayrak has interests in construction, energy and real estate, and has said he was talking to Abramovich about the sale process. Abramovich said last week he was selling the London club, but that sale is now on hold with Chelsea operating under a special government licence, and the Premier League board has disqualified him as a club director. A British transport ministry source said on Friday that Britain was searching out helicopters and jets belonging to the sanctioned oligarchs. Multiple properties including opulent yachts worth hundreds of millions of dollars have been seized by authorities in Europe in recent days. According to tracking sites Marine Traffic and Vessel Finder, Abramovich's $600 million yacht Solaris had been off Montenegro heading to Istanbul. But by 2030 GMT the vessel's status changed to ""awaiting orders"" and its destination was removed NATO member Turkey has close ties with both Kyiv and Moscow and has balanced its criticism of the invasion of Ukraine with its opposition to Western sanctions on Moscow. Russia calls its movement of troops into Ukraine a ""special military operation"". CALL FOR SANCTIONS In an interview with Israel's Channel 12 on Friday, Victoria Nuland, the U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs, said Washington was asking Israel to join in financial and export sanctions against Russia. Speaking in Slovakia, which borders Ukraine, visiting Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said Israel ""will not be a route to bypass sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and other Western countries"". Lapid did not say directly whether Israel was considering its own sanctions. But he said the foreign ministry was ""coordinating the issue together with partners including the Bank of Israel, the Finance Ministry, the Economy Ministry, the Airports Authority, the Energy Ministry, and others"". Asked for further details, the Bank of Israel said in a statement to Reuters that it was ""constantly monitoring developments in the payments systems, the markets, and the financial system."" Any Israeli sanctions could complicate efforts by Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett to mediate the Russian-Ukrainian crisis. He held talks in Moscow with Putin on March 5 and has spoken several times by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. A senior Israeli official said Abramovich was not involved in Israel's mediation efforts. Sympathy for Ukraine is strong in Israel. The country's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem said on Thursday that it had suspended a strategic partnership with Abramovich after Britain's move against him.

3/15/2022,"A man was charged with attempted murder in what police have described as a ""brutal hate-crime"" against an Asian woman in New York last week, with video of the incident showing the woman being punched over 100 times. Tammel Esco, 42, was arrested after allegedly calling a 67-year-old woman an ""Asian b----,"" following her into a building and severely beating her on Friday in the city of Yonkers, just north of New York City. Esco was detained the same day shortly after the alleged incident when officers saw him still outside the building, but the Yonkers Police Department announced the arrest and released video of the attack on Monday. Surveillance video from the building's vestibule area show the woman was attempting to open the second door into the lobby when she was hit on the head from behind and fell to the ground. Video shows the woman was punched 125 times, stomped on another seven times and spat on. ""This is one of the most appalling attacks I have ever seen; to beat a helpless woman is despicable and targeting her because of her race makes it more so,"" said Yonkers Police Commissioner John J. Mueller. The woman, who was not identified, is recovering in the hospital in stable condition police said. She suffered facial bone fractures and bleeding on the brain from the assault. Esco was charged with attempted murder as a hate crime and one count of assault as a hate crime. He was arraigned Saturday and remains in custody at the Westchester County Jail on Monday, according to inmate records. Esco is being represented by the Westchester Legal Aid Society, which did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment. Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano called hate crimes ""intolerable.""

Elon Musk on Monday advised that it's ""better to own physical things"" like homes and stocks — but added that he wouldn't sell his bitcoin, ether, and dogecoin holdings. Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and the world's richest person, said it was better to own physical things instead of US dollars when inflation was running high. He appeared to make an exception for cryptocurrencies, though. In a Twitter thread discussing inflation, Musk said: ""As a general principle, for those looking for advice from this thread, it is generally better to own physical things like a home or stock in companies you think make good products, than dollars when inflation is high."" He added: ""I still own & won't sell my Bitcoin, Ethereum or Doge fwiw."" Inflation in the US hit 7.9% year-on-year in February, its highest level since 1982, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Musk said Tesla and SpaceX were ""seeing significant recent inflation pressure in raw materials & logistics."" Musk announced in May 2020 that he planned to sell ""almost all"" his physical belongings, including his multimillion-dollar property portfolio. He sold his last remaining home in December 2021. The billionaire entrepreneur is an advocate of cryptocurrencies, albeit with caveats. He's regularly voiced support for dogecoin and discussed the merits of crypto with leading figures from the tech industry. Tesla said it bought about $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in early 2021, to be used as a hedge against inflation. Tesla's share price has fallen by about 35% this year, lowering Musk's fortune by about a quarter — but he's still the richest person in the world, with a net worth of about $206 billion, Bloomberg's Billionaires Index estimated.

3/15/2022,"Like most Americans, I’ve spent the last few weeks contemplating the implications of Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, including those that extend beyond ever-increasing gasoline prices and grocery bills. As I was explaining to my inquisitive 6-year-old, war is, sadly, a perennial state of human existence. This isn’t the first war of her lifetime, and no matter how much we strive for peace throughout the world, it won’t be the last. But unlike the wars of the recent past — even those in which U.S. troops were committed — the fight in Ukraine feels closer to home. The images and stories of ordinary men taking up arms, of women constructing Molotov cocktails in their town squares and of families resolutely hunkering down in defense of their nation are as terrifying as they are compelling. They are hopeful, too. They remind us that when their culture, freedoms and way of life are under assault, many people will risk and even lose their own lives to ensure their long-term survival. What would we do in such circumstances? A recent Quinnipiac University poll posed that same question to Americans: Would you stay and fight or leave the country? A bare majority, 55%, said they would stay and fight, while 38% said they would leave. “When confronted with a terrible hypothetical that would put them in the shoes of the Ukrainians, Americans say they would stand and fight rather than seek safety in another country,” said Quinnipiac polling analyst Tim Malloy. That’s one way to spin it, I guess. For me, the fact that just under half of my friends and neighbors would hypothetically abandon their homeland and all it stands for in the face of a foreign invader is less than encouraging. Many people don’t even seem to have hypothetical patriotism, let alone fortitude. Further disheartening is that the youngest Americans, those ages 18-34 and most physically capable, were even less likely to stay and fight. Only 45% said they would remain, while 48% would flee. Comparatively, two-thirds of the 50-to-64-year-old cohort said they would remain. That’s not wholly surprising given that so much of the recent discontentment with America is concentrated among the youth. Equally unsurprising is that political differences also play a role in willingness to defend our nation. Republicans (68%-25%) and independents (57%-36%) said they would stay and fight, while Democrats said, 52%-40%, that they would leave the country. That seems consistent with our political divide. Many people on the left find America, because of its historical failures and present-day inadequacies, unworthy of our defense. But there are elements of that thinking on the political right now, too. For all the chest-thumping of the MAGA right, a surprising number of people believe that the United States — much like Ukraine — has brought destruction upon itself, and any attack would be wholly warranted if not deserved. I don’t disagree that we are a decadent society — one that has generally enjoyed so much freedom for so long that we have sometimes lost all perspective. To wit, I received a promotional email last week from the children’s clothier, explaining that, in an effort to defend the children of the world from ongoing “violence and discrimination,” it would donate equal amounts to a domestic LGTBQ nonprofit and an international aid organization. As if transgender policies in Texas and Florida (even if one believe them to be misguided) are the moral equivalent of deadly rocket attacks on a children’s hospital in Ukraine. They are not. America, in spite of its shortcomings and failures, is worth defending. Our highest ideals — liberty, equality and democracy — would never be truly achieved if we were to turn and run from an invader. While I have no delusions about my ability to fight, if we ever faced an existential crisis like the people of Ukraine now face, I would stay. I hope more of us would do the same. Cynthia M.
