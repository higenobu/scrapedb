5/9/2022,"Morrisons beats Issa brothers in battle to rescue McColl's Nuclear plant under threat amid ‘political opposition’ to Chinese backing, EDF warns The FTSE 100 drops 1.7pc on China growth fears Lucy Burton: It's just 'banter': how City workers get away with spouting repugnant views Sign up here for our daily business briefing newsletter Russia is facing its deepest economic decline in almost three decades as it grapples with the fallout from Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the Finance Ministry has admitted. Internal forecasts estimate that Russia’s GDP could shrink by as much as 12pc this year, Bloomberg reports. That would be the biggest contraction since 1994, when Russia’s Soviet-era economy lurched towards capitalism under its first president Boris Yeltsin. It would also wipe out around a decade of economic growth. Russia is under increasing pressure from a wave of western sanctions, while the EU is preparing to step up its assault on the Kremlin’s revenues with a ban on oil imports. Putin’s government has yet to issue a public economic outlook, but the Finance Ministry’s figures are more pessimistic than the central bank’s forecasts of a contraction between 8pc and 10pc this year. Raising interest rates quickly may spare households an even bigger squeeze on living standards, according to a top Bank of England policy maker. Speaking to the Resolution Foundation think tank, Michael Saunders said he feared inflation expectations may take off unless the Bank acts firmly now. Mr Saunders was one of only three members who voted for an aggressive 50 basis point increase last week. The Bank raised rates by 25 basis points to 1pc. The MPC member, who steps down in August, warned that inflation was ""uncomfortably high"" and that failing to act swiftly ""could require a sharper adjustment in monetary policy... and result in an even worse outcome for real incomes and living standards"". The Bank of England is grappling with soaring inflation – which it forecast will top 10pc in inflation – as well as a slowdown in growth, as it warned the UK economy will shrink by 0.25pc next year. Wall Street's major indices slid at the opening bell as investors are gripped by concerns over the economic outlook. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the declines, dropping 1.8pc. The S&P 500 fell 1pc, while the Dow Jones shed 0.7pc. Britain has invested £2bn to forge ahead with its new nuclear deterrent amid the rising threat from Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Helen Cahill has more details: The Ministry of Defence has awarded contracts to BAE Systems and Rolls Royce to build the Dreadnought submarines which will replace the current Vanguard submarines carrying Britain's nuclear warheads. The third phase of the programme is projected to cost nearly £10bn in total and will deliver the first submarine for trials at sea. BAE and Rolls Royce are manufacturing four Dreadnought submarines, which will be the largest ever built for the Royal Navy. First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Ben Key said the continuous defence system would provide ""the ultimate guarantee of security"" for Britain over the next fifty years. The first submarine is under construction in the Barrow-in-Furness shipyard and is due to be delivered in 2030. BAE has described the project as ""one of the world's most complex engineering challenges"". The submarine will be 153.6 metres in length, equivalent to three Olympic swimming pools, and will be manned by 130 crew members. ​Read Helen's full story here The dire internal forecasts from Russia's Finance Ministry suggest the country could be on track for its worst economic decline since 1994. A 12pc contraction in GDP would be the deepest since the days of Boris Yeltsin, who served as Russia's first president after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin, who presided over Russia's faltering move to capitalism, was a controversial figure who came under fire for his handling of the country's economy, not to mention his erratic behaviour and heavy drinking. Made.com has snapped up online homeware platform Trouva in a bid to ramp up its growth plans. The furniture retailer said the deal will help expand its online marketplace business. Terms were not disclosed. London-based Trouva was launched in 2015 and has relationships with more than 700 boutiques across Europe. It will continue to operate as a standalone business, led by current bosses Alex Loizou and Dimple Patel. Made added that the acquisition means it will be able to ""avoid some"" anticipated investment spending on its marketplace business. It therefore expects capital expenditure of up to £18m for 2022, having previously forecast spending of up to £20m. Shares in Made jumped 4pc after the announcement. Bitcoin has slumped to its lowest level in almost a year amid a sell-off in cryptocurrencies as investors flee riskier assets. The world's largest digital coin fell as much as 4.6pc and was trading at around $32,800 – its lowest since July 2021. Most cryptocurrencies have come under pressure as fears about tightening monetary policy and a slowdown in global economic growth rattled investors. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has warned that unanimity voting on key policy areas no longer made sense if the EU wanted to move quickly. She told the European Parliament: ""I have always argued that unanimity voting in some key areas simply no longer makes sense if we want to be able to move faster. Or that Europe should play a greater role – for example in health or defence."" The EU chief also said that she would be ready to back treaty change where needed to deliver on EU citizens' ideas on the bloc's future. It comes amid divisions between members states over the EU's plans to block oil imports from Russia. An Apple executive has quit the company in protest over the tech giant’s demands that staff return to the office for three days a week. James Titcomb reports: Ian Goodfellow, Apple’s director of machine learning, told staff on leaving that he disagreed with the company’s insistence on staff returning to its Silicon Valley headquarters, according to technology website The Verge. He is reported to have said: “I believe strongly that more flexibility would have been the best policy for my team.” Apple staff must currently work at least one day in the office and from May 23, they will be required to come into work on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. Staff will be able to work from home or in the office on Wednesday and Friday and work remotely for four weeks a year. The policy is stricter than many of those at Silicon Valley firms such as Meta, Google and Twitter, where staff have been told they can work remotely permanently or have been given more flexibility over when they work in an office. Apple staff have protested over the company’s demands and said that employees are leaving because of the requirements, but Mr Goodfellow is the most senior reported departure. ​Read James' full story here Wall Street looks set to continue its slump this afternoon as investors fear aggressive interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve, while a slowdown in China is fuelling recession fears. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the declines, with futures tumbling 2pc. Tech giants Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google owner Alphabet, Meta and Tesla were all down between 2pc and 3pc in pre-market trading. The benchmark S&P 500 fell 1.6pc, while the Dow Jones was down 1.4pc. Traders are expecting the Fed to raise interest rates by 75 basis points at its next meeting, after announcing a 50 basis point increase this month. Tech stocks have borne the brunt of the recent sell-off, as their returns and yields are discounted more heavily when US Treasury yields rise. Commodity trader Trafigura is investing in a project to develop the UK's first lithium refinery as it bets on surging demand for the metal used in electric vehicle batteries. Trafigura will invest in the plant, which is being developed by Green Lithium, and will also supply feedstock. The project aims to sell batter-grade lithium chemicals to electric vehicle makers across Europe, with initial production targeted for the end of 2024. Sean Sargent, chief executive of Green Lithium, said: The electric revolution is fundamental to reducing the carbon emissions that contribute to global climate change and ensuring net-zero targets can be met. Green Lithium’s refinery will accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and sustainable energy storage through the increased supply of low-carbon, battery-grade lithium chemicals – a key component of lithium-ion batteries. China’s premier has warned its job market faces a “complicated and grim” outlook as the country’s zero-Covid strategy causes trade exports to plunge, writes Louis Ashworth. Li Keqiang warned of job losses as Beijing and Shanghai tightened curbs on residents as part of efforts to contain the pandemic. He instructed government departments and regional authorities to focus on measures aimed at helping businesses avoid shedding jobs. New figures released by China’s National Bureau of Statistics showed joblessness rose to 5.8pc in March, the highest since May 2020. Mr Li said: “Stabilising employment matters to people’s livelihoods, it is also a key support for the economy to operate within a reasonable range."" It came as data showed China saw a further trade slowdown in April as local lockdowns curb demand, hit production and spur logistics issues in the world’s second-biggest economy. ​Read Louis' full story here EU industry chief Thierry Breton will meet Elon Musk in Texas today to discuss global supply chain issues and new rules on policing online content. The pair will meet this afternoon in Austin, where his electric vehicle firm Tesla is headquartered. It comes weeks after the world's richest man secured a $44bn deal to buy Twitter. Musk has put free speech at the heart of his pledge to revitalise Twitter, but his comments sparked a response from Mr Breton that the platform must comply with the EU's new Digital Services Act tackling illegal online content. A spokesman for the EU chief said: Tech and supply chains will be high on the agenda at Tesla with Elon Musk. Free speech will also be on the menu between Thierry Breton and Elon Musk. So will EU regulation. Expect exchange on the Digital Services Act and how 'new' Twitter will play by European rules. The FTSE 100 has extended its losses in morning trading to mark a downbeat start to the week. The blue-chip index slumped 1.2pc, with the decline fuelled by China growth worries and the Bank of England's grim outlook for the UK economy. Miners were the biggest drag, with Glencore, Rio Tino and Anglo American all losing ground. Investors were already rattled after the Bank of England issued a warning over the double risks of a recession and inflation surging past 10pc. This was compounded by the slowest growth in Chinese exports in two years as Beijing's zero-Covid policy takes its toll. The Bank branch of the Northern Line will reopen next week after months of works that disrupted a key commuting route into the City of London. Transport for London confirmed services from Kennington to Moorgate will resume in full on May 16 after shutting down in January. The closure allowed for works to increase capacity at Bank station, which has been plagued by overcrowding at peak times, as well as making the stop more accessible for passengers with disabilites. Morrisons has emerged victorious in a battle to take control of failed convenience store chain McColl’s, snubbing the billionaire owners of Asda. The supermarket giant, which is owned by the US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, has seen off competition from petrol station operator EG Group after a dramatic bidding war over the weekend. The deal, which will be structured as a pre-pack administration, will ensure all of McColl’s stores and workforce is preserved, Sky News reported. McColl’s, which has a debt pile of around £170m, was left teetering on the brink of collapse after it fell into administration on Friday, putting 16,000 jobs at risk. Morrisons had been the frontrunner to take control of McColl’s last week before lenders rejected a rescue deal that would have seen £100m of debt rolled into the supermarket chain. EG Group, whose billionaire owners the Issa brothers also control Asda, launched a rival bid, which it later improved to cover funding for the company’s pension scheme. This prompted Morrisons to table a second offer last night that included a pledge to repay lenders in full immediately – a key sticking point in its original proposal. Natural gas prices declined this morning as Russia tried to reassure buyers that they can keep paying for gas without breaching sanctions. The market has been seized by supply concerns about Putin demanded that ""unfriendly"" nations pay for gas supplies in roubles. Poland and Bulgaria have already been cut off after they refused the demand. But in a letter seen by Bloomberg, Gazprom told European clients that a new order published by the Kremlin on May 4 “clarifies the procedure” set out in the initial decree on ruble payments for gas. It's not clear whether this will be enough to calm EU fears, however. Benchmark European prices fell 7.6pc, while the UK equivalent was down 9.4pc. BP is reportedly set to buy a stake in a $36bn (£29bn) green hydrogen project in western Australia and become its developer. The investment in the Asian Renewable Energy Hub could be announced within days, The Australian newspaper reported. The project aims to install 26 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity over a 6,500 square kilometre stretch of the Pilbara region. It's hoping to produce about 1.8m tonnes of hydrogen a year while plotting exports as soon as 2027. Sterling is continued its slide against the dollar after the Bank of England's grim forecast for the economy, while Sinn Fein's election victory sparked fresh Brexit worries. The pound slumped to its lowest in two years last week after the Bank warned the UK economy will contract in 2023 and forecast inflation at more than 10pc later in the year. Analysts also warned of tensions over the Northern Ireland border after Sinn Fein, whose ultimate goal is a united Ireland, became the biggest party in Northern Ireland's Assembly for the first time. The pound dropped 0.5pc against the dollar to $1.2287. Against the euro, it was down 0.1pc at 85.61p. ICYMI – Morrisons sought to gatecrash a takeover for failed convenience store chain McColl's last night in a snub to the billionaire owners of Asda who were on the brink of securing a deal. Gareth Corfield has more details: Morrisons, which is owned by the US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, has made a second offer to buy McColl’s that includes a pledge to repay its lenders in full immediately, one of the key sticking points of the supermarket’s previous bid, Sky News reported. PwC is understood to have last night taken final offers from Morrisons and EG Group, the petrol forecourt empire owned by the billionaire Issa brothers who are also behind Asda. McColl’s, which has a debt pile of around £170m, fell into administration Friday, putting 16,000 jobs at risk. Morrisons had been in pole position to take control of McColl’s last week before lenders rejected a solvent offer that would have involved them rolling over more than £100m of debt into the supermarket chain, but being repaid in full as the loans expired. Read Gareth's full story here Here's some more on the story behind Capco's share price movement this morning: Shaftesbury and Capital & Countries have confirmed they're in advance discussions to create a real estate giant that would own assets across some of London's most sought-after areas. The merger would create a REIT (real estate investment trust) focused on the West End, including Covent Garden, Carnaby, Chinatown and Soho. Under the proposed terms of the deals, Shaftesbury would own 53pc of the combined company, while Capco would own 47pc. Capco currently holds a stake of around 25pc in Shaftesbury. The two firms said Norway's sovereign wealth fund – a major investor in both – had backed the all-stock deal. Ian Hawksworth, chief executive of Capco, would lead the combined group, which could be worth around £3.6bn. The FTSE 100 has dipped at the open, following Asian markets lower as lockdowns in China added to investor concerns after the Bank of England's dire warnings last week. The blue-chip index fell 0.2pc in early trading, with miners leading losses as metal prices dropped on demand concerns. Rio Tinto, Glencore and Anglo American were the biggest drags on the index. Rightmove was the largest faller, sliding more than 4pc after it announced the departure of its chief executive. Bucking the trend were energy giants Shell and BP, which rose amid ongoing concerns about an EU oil embargo. The domestically-focused FTSE 250 slumped 1pc. Capital & Countries dropped more than 6pc amid merger talks with real estate rival Shaftesbury. Activist investor Dan Loeb has boosted his stake in Shell amid booming profits for the oil giant. His hedge fund Third Point added to its position in the first quarter and also took a long position in miner Glencore, citing demand for copper and nickel for the transition to renewable energy. Mr Loeb revealed his stake in Shell in October and called for a break-up of the company, with its renewables operations separated from its legacy business. It comes after Shell reported that its profit nearly tripled to a record in the first quarter as it cashed in on surging energy prices. China's export growth has slumped to its slowest in almost two years as the fallout from Beijing's zero-Covid policy adds to global economic woes. Exports in dollar terms grew 3.9pc in April from a year earlier, dropping sharply from the 14.7pc growth reported in March. It was the slowest pace since June 2020. Imports were broadly stable year-on-year, improving slightly from a 0.1pc fall in March. The lacklustre figures show China's trade sector, which accounts for about a third of total GDP, is losing momentum as lockdowns in cities such as Shanghai hammered supply chains. The problems heighten the risk of a deeper economic slowdown in the world's second-largest economy and beyond. In corporate news this morning, Rightmove chief executive Peter Brooks-Johnson has announced he's stepping down after more than 16 years at the firm. The UK's largest property website said Mr Brooks-Johnson will remain in the role until its full-year figures are published in February 2023. The company is now starting the search for his successor. The Rightmove chief joined the company in 2006 and rose to the top job in May 2017. He was previously a management consultant with Accenture and the Berkeley Partnership. Shares slid 4.8pc following the announcement. Mr Brooks-Johnson said: ""With Rightmove progressing well on its mission to make home moving easier and our strong trading from 2021 continuing into 2022, I have decided it is an appropriate time to seek a new challenge."" Andrew Fisher, chairman of Rightmove, said: ""Peter has made a significant contribution to the success of Rightmove over the past 16 years and whilst we are disappointed that he will be leaving the business, we understand his decision."" The FTSE 100 has started the week in negative territory after a grim outlook from the Bank of England rattled investors last week. The blue-chip index fell 0.2pc at the open to 7,374 points. Japan has rallied behind its G7 allies in vowing to end imports of Russian oil, though it warned the move would take time. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said it was an ""extremely difficult"" decision, but that G7 unity was important. It's likely to have only a limited impact, given Japan imported only 3.6pc of its crude oil from Russia in March. Still, it will add to pressures pushing global energy prices higher. Japan also said it would retain its stake in the the Sakhalin 1 oil and Sakhalin 2 liquefied natural gas projects in Russia. The UK has announced a fresh round of sanctions against Russia and Belarus – targeting £1.7bn of trade. The Department of International Trade said the new measures will target goods including platinum and palladium, which are used to make mobile phones and computers. Import tariffs will cover £1.4bn of goods, while planned export bans will hit £250m in sectors of the Russian economy most reliant on UK products, including chemicals, plastics, rubber, and machinery. It takes the total value of products subjected to British sanctions to more than £4bn. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Secretary of State for International Trade, said: We are determined to do our utmost to thwart Putin’s aims in Ukraine and undermine his illegal invasion, which has seen barbaric acts perpetrated against the Ukrainian people. This far-reaching package of sanctions will inflict further damage on the Russian war machine. It is part of a wider coordinated effort by the many countries around the world who are horrified by Russia’s conduct and determined to bring to bear our economic might to persuade Putin to change course. Good morning.  A top EU officials has proposed that the bloc should seize $300bn of frozen Russian foreign exchange reserves to help fund the reconstruction of Ukraine. The West has taken control of around half of Putin's $600bn of gold and forex reserves, and officials are now considering how these could be used to support Ukraine's recovery. The seizure of foreign exchange reserves would be a dramatic move, but EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell pointed to the US decision to set aside $3.5bn of the Afghan central bank's assets to pay for humanitarian aid and compensation for victims of the 9/11 attacks. He told the Financial Times: “I would be very much in favour because it is full of logic. We have the money in our pockets, and someone has to explain to me why it is good for the Afghan money and not good for the Russian money.” 1) Bond tremors hit Italy as eurozone risk returns with a vengeance Italian political risk is back on the table, just as the ECB debt shield disappears 2) Bank of England staff in the office just one day a week Staff spend the majority of the week working from home despite ministers urging workers to go back to the office 3) Overhaul ‘outdated’ laws and allow insects to be fed to pigs and chickens, Tesco boss says Plus: From insect feed to vertical farms - we need a bonfire of red tape to deliver the food of the future 4) Morrisons gatecrashes Issa brothers' bid for McColl's The supermarket has launched a last-gasp attempt to wrest the convenience store chain from the clutches of Asda's owners 5) ‘Save less and borrow more’ to avoid recession, economists say Rampant inflation and growing uncertainty mean experts have slashed their forecasts for household consumption Tokyo stocks opened lower on Monday, tracking US falls on investor concern over higher interest rates, with focus shifting to Japanese corporate earnings.

5/9/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Rivian Automotive Inc. sank 17% in U.S. premarket trading after a media report that Ford Motor Co. is selling 8 million of its shares in the electric-pickup maker at a discount.

The U.S. manufacturer owns about 12% of the electric-vehicle hopeful, or just under 102 million shares after taking a stake prior to Rivian going public last year. An insider lockup period expired Sunday after the November share sale that saw the company’s market value briefly top $100 billion making the developer more valuable at the time than Ford and General Motors Co. Rivian shares have since plunged after its pickup launch was slower than investors expected. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is also selling a block of 13 million to 15 million shares in the manufacturer for an unknown seller, Faber reported, citing unidentified people. Both blocks are priced at $26.90 -- a discount of 6.7% to Friday’s close. Irvine, California-based Rivian is a high-profile, well-funded newcomer to the growing pack of EV manufacturers. The IPO was the sixth biggest in U.S. history, generating more than $13 billion to fund growth. However, Rivian has struggled to ramp production of its products at an existing plant in Normal, Illinois, due to supply-chain pressures. (Updates stock move in first paragraph.)

5/9/2022,"Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here. The Great Resignation, the economic trend of people quitting their jobs in pursuit of other opportunities, has been greeted by a harsh reality: the Great Reset. This week, a spate of tech companies - largely those valued above $1 billion from their venture capital investors - announced reductions in their workforce. I wrote three layoff stories in fewer than 24 hours, a cadence I haven’t experienced since the beginning of the pandemic. These stories may have the same ledes, but they feel dramatically different. already is pic.twitter.com/FezWy71QOU — natasha (@nmasc_) May 5, 2022 Unlike before, when startups had to lay off employees in response to the sudden shock of the pandemic, today’s tech companies are making cuts due to - more or less - their own lack of discipline. I have more empathy for a founder who was caught off guard by a pandemic than one who overspent despite knowing that the boom wouldn’t exist forever, and is now cutting the same employees that helped them soar. Whiplash, I’m hearing from some now former employees, is an understatement. Growth is tricky, and a part of a founder’s job is to moonshot their way to scale, but we also need to remember that change was inevitable. Especially for startups that hit product market fit during a once-in-a-lifetime event. The biggest difference between layoffs in 2020 versus layoffs in 2022 is cash, potentially a lifeline. Startups raised massive amounts of capital thanks to larger average deal sizes over the past two years; meaning that some of the capital that was once used to sweeten benefits or candidates' offers may be pivoting to runway. Jason Lemkin, head of SaaStr, put it well on Twitter: “Many startups also lucked out and have years in the bank due to covid rounds… capital that they wouldn't have had otherwise.” If you’re a founder, now is the time to unlearn some of that lavish spending and focus on conserving what you do have. For employees, let me know which spreadsheets I need to retweet. For more thoughts, read a round-up of all the tech layoffs this past week, and then head to TechCrunch+ for some advice on how to navigate the market.

As always, you can support me by forwarding this newsletter to a friend or following me on Twitter or my blog.  A number of venture firms made news this week, either to announce new funding or new strategies. In Afore’s case, it’s both. The pre-seed firm tells TechCrunch that they closed a $150 million fund and introduced an in-house accelerator of sorts with a standard deal. Going forward, any accepted company will receive $1 million at a $10 million post-money valuation. It’s a not-so-subtle dig at Y Combinator and a way for Afore to stand out during a changing market. Here’s why it’s important: Afore isn’t the only firm to change its mind. Backstage Capital told me this week that, after investing in 200 companies, it will now only do follow-on checks in its existing portfolio. For now, that means no net new Backstage companies, even though the firm is growing assets under management. Also, we’re hearing that Unusual Ventures’ new $485 million fund comes with an impressive promise of full-time help.

5/9/2022,"One of the biggest video game deals of all time was announced in January with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) saying they would acquire video game company Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ: ATVI) for $95 a share. What Happened: With the deal still pending and shares trading well below the $95 level, Benzinga spoke to merger and arbitrage expert Julian Klymochko. Klymochko is the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Accelerate Funds, a company that offers ETFs, and alternative funds with arbitrage are among the market opportunities it offers investors. Klymochko has a history of analyzing mergers and often invests in the arbitrage opportunity of deals, or the amount that can be made if the deal closes. Klymochko recently estimated that he has invested in/analyzed over 2,500 mergers over the last 15 years. Related Link: Exclusive: Arbitrage Expert Julian Klymochko Breaks Down Twitter Acquisition And Elon Musk’s Options Activision Acquisition: Similar to the acquisition of Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, shares of the target company Activision are trading well below their buyout price, which offers a potential investment opportunity. It was recently announced by Warren Buffett that Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK-A)(NYSE: BRK-B) owns a 9.5% stake in Activision Blizzard, seeing an opportunity to capture the deal spread with shares trading well below the acquisition price. “It appears to be a wise investment by Buffett because his team liked the stock before the deal. It could be a case of ‘heads we win, tails we win’ because the successful arbitrage could bring a 22% annualized return, while they would still like the stock as a hold in the case in which the deal breaks,” Klymochko said. There is some degree of risk with the Microsoft acquisition, as antitrust regulators could block the deal. Klymochko thinks this shouldn’t be a huge risk. “The main risk in Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision is an overzealous antitrust regulator looking to make a case against ‘big tech’ and taking the parties to court to block the deal, despite them not having much horizontal overlap. The video game business is highly competitive. When the transaction closes, Microsoft will become the world’s third-largest gaming company by revenue behind Tencent and Sony, which would not be an insurmountable issue under a normal antitrust regime.” Price Action: Activision Blizzard shares closed Friday at $77.84.

5/9/2022,"May 9 (Reuters) - Palantir Technologies Inc forecast second-quarter revenue below Wall Street expectations on Monday, indicating slowing sales growth, as the data analytics software firm ramps up its salesforce to sign more deals amid rising competition. However, the company, known for its work with the U.S. Army and the Central Intelligence Agency, said it sees a ""wide range"" of potential upside to its forecast driven by opportunities arising from ""developing geopolitical events"", with the Ukraine war likely to boost defense spending by governments. But slowing revenue growth at the software maker's government business, which rose 16% in the first quarter, also raised concerns. On the Europe crisis, Chief Operating Officer Shyam Sankar said nothing as a result of the war is reflected in the first quarter, but Palantir has been working and investing in anticipation of contract awards from governments and expects ""marginal impact"" in the second quarter and more growth beyond that. Analysts have raised concerns over Palantir's large dependence on government contracts and so, the company, which only provides its software to the United States and ""its allies"", has shifted its focus on signing more deals with commercial customers and has been ramping up its sales force. The company posted first-quarter revenue of $446.4 million, above Refinitiv IBES estimates of $443.4 million, driven by strength in its U.S. commercial business. However, it forecast weaker margins on increased sales and marketing spend. The company forecast adjusted operating margin of 20% for the current quarter, compared with 31% last year. Net loss narrowed to $101.4 million, or 5 cents per share, from $123.5 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier. The company forecast second-quarter revenue of $470 million, implying a growth of just 25% year-over-year, compared with 49% growth a year earlier. Analysts on average expected a revenue of $483.9 million.

5/9/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Bond markets could be in for something of a rebound after their record plummet, with investors looking for signs that U.S. inflationary pressures have touched their peak. Most Read from Bloomberg Philippines Election: Marcos Jr. Widens Lead in Vote Count U.S. Futures Signal Equity Plunge; Dollar Jumps: Markets Wrap Day Trader Army Loses All the Money It Made in Meme-Stock Era EU Push to Ban Russian Oil Is Stalled by Hungarian Demands Ukraine Latest: Japan to Phase Out Russian Oil; Crude Swings Global bonds have racked up a record straight nine months of losses, with April being the worst ever, according to data stretching back to 1990. But fund managers are already pointing to signs of a change in the inflation and economic growth outlook that could help boost market sentiment. Data this week are likely to show that U.S. consumer prices rose 8% from a year earlier in April, according to Bloomberg economists including Anna Wong. That would make it likely that March’s 8.5% increase was the high for the current cycle, they wrote in a report on Friday. “If we are seeing the peak in inflation then maybe we have also seen the peak in pricing central bank reaction functions and more aggressiveness and maybe we get more moderation in our losses” in bonds and equities, said Stefanie Holtze-Jen, APAC CIO of Deutsche Bank International Private Bank in a Bloomberg Television interview. “So light at the end of the tunnel may be this week.” Still, with U.S. employment data for last month posting strong gains, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to drop its hawkish rhetoric for now, and that may weigh particularly on credit given risks for the economy. The slowest export growth in China since June 2020 in April highlights supply-chain disruptions from Covid lockdowns that will likely continue to put upward pressure on consumer prices. Concerns about runaway inflation have hastened central banks into action, with the Fed hiking interest rates by 50 basis points last week and flagging more such moves in coming months. Funds with a fixed-income focus suffered their biggest outflows since April 2020 last week, according to EPFR data. The yield on the five-year U.S. Treasury rose to 3.1% on Monday, its highest since 2008. Investors at this point are finding it hard to hide in any asset classes and risks abound including falling demand in China and spikes in energy prices. “There’s so much downside risk and so many adverse economic conditions at the moment that are really hitting financial market sentiment,” said Katrina Ell, Senior Economist at Moody’s Analytics. “China’s zero-Covid policy is having a huge and deep economic impact. It’s really putting a cap on China’s economic recovery.” Spreads on Asian high-grade dollar bonds widened three to five basis points earlier on Monday amid light trading with Hong Kong on a holiday, according to a trader. That puts them on track for their highest since late-March at just over 150 basis points, according to a Bloomberg index.

5/9/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Michael Calvey spent decades believing in Russia. He made successful bets on technology and consumer firms as the country emerged from the breakup of Soviet Union, and stayed invested after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Even his arrest and incarceration in 2019 didn’t put him off. Most Read from Bloomberg Philippines Election: Marcos Jr. Widens Lead in Vote Count U.S. Futures Signal Equity Plunge; Dollar Jumps: Markets Wrap Day Trader Army Loses All the Money It Made in Meme-Stock Era EU Push to Ban Russian Oil Is Stalled by Hungarian Demands Ukraine Latest: Japan to Phase Out Russian Oil; Crude Swings It helped that funds managed by Calvey’s Baring Vostok Capital Partners exploded in value from $2.6 billion to $9 billion during the 2 1/2 years he battled charges he said were baseless from jail and, later, house arrest, according to a person with knowledge of the firm’s operations, who asked not to be named discussing results. But like much of the world, Calvey was caught unaware by President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Now, his investors, including the California Public Employees’ Pension Retirement System, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and General Electric Co.’s pension fund, are uncertain if they’ll get their remaining money back. Russian assets are effectively worthless to foreign holders since sanctions prevent them from selling, forcing investors in affected funds to write down their value significantly and wait. It’s a problem that’s affecting many firms that stuck with Russia, from specialist fund managers to a dozen of the world’s biggest banks, which together have $100 billion exposed to the country across industries both inside and outside sanctions, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg. “People like Calvey naively thought that they could trust Putin,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale School of Management professor who is tracking foreign companies’ responses to the Russian invasion. “Russia is uninvestable for many years.” A Baring Vostok spokesman declined to comment. House Arrest Calvey, 54, set up Baring Vostok in 1994. The firm was long considered the gold standard of Russian private equity, in part due to its 500-fold return from an early bet on internet giant Yandex NV. His funds have raised $3.7 billion in total capital, and successfully sold out of firms including Tinkoff Bank and online classifieds service Avito.ru. Calvey’s prominence meant his arrest attracted international attention. He and several colleagues were accused of overvaluing a company that his funds contributed to the capital of Vostochny Bank, a lender then controlled by Baring Vostok. Calvey denied the charges, blaming them on a dispute with the bank’s minority owner. U.S. President Joe Biden raised the case with Putin last June, and many top Russian business executives rallied around Calvey. Ultimately, a court handed him a 5 1/2-year suspended sentence for embezzlement last August. Calvey is appealing the ruling. Throughout his prosecution, during which he appeared in a courtroom cage and wore an electronic tracking bracelet, Calvey remained an enthusiastic Russia booster. In September, he told a conference he would continue to invest in the country. Then the world changed overnight. Calvey was abroad when the invasion began in late February and does not currently plan to return to Russia, according to acquaintances who asked not to be identified in order to speak about Calvey’s personal travel. ‘No Exit’ Russia’s economy is on course for two years of contraction for the first time since the recession that followed the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, according to a Bloomberg survey, after foreign governments slapped sanctions on trade and finance, froze the reserves of its central bank and cut many of the nation’s lenders from the SWIFT global messaging system. In response, Russia blocked foreigners from selling assets and restricted the movement of rubles abroad to prevent further havoc on local markets. In a sign that Russia is not planning to ease restrictions on foreign-owned assets, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said at a briefing April 27 that there aren’t any discussions currently about allowing foreigners back onto the Moscow Exchange, the country’s main stock market. “We are seeing selling pressure on anything that touches Russia but we are not seeing a lot of buyers,” said Gerald Cooper, a partner at private markets advisory business Campbell Lutyens & Co. Several investors have called his firm looking to exit Calvey’s funds, Cooper added. “Baring Vostok has been a very successful private equity fund but I think you would be hard pressed to find secondary buyers that are willing to take on that type of exposure.” While Baring Vostok hasn’t raised a new fund for over a decade, many investors are exposed to these latest shocks via their long-term commitments to its existing vehicles. The University of Texas Investment Management Co., which manages money for the University of Texas and Texas A&M systems, invested $50 million in 2012’s Fund V, public records show. Karen Adler, a spokeswoman, said the endowment is monitoring its legal requirements in regards to its investment. The MacArthur Foundation, which put money into Baring Vostok funds raised in 2007 and 2012, is exploring ways to unwind its investments. However, “given the situation, there is no prudent way to exit at this time,” said Kristen Mack, a spokeswoman for the foundation. California’s pension fund invested $77.8 million in Baring Vostok’s 2007 Fund IV and has about $15 million remaining in it, according to spokesman Joe DeAnda. Sanctions and market restrictions are hurting Calpers’ ability to liquidate its Russian holdings and it’s monitoring evolving sanctions and federal actions, according to a statement in March. The fund declined to comment on specific investments. A spokeswoman for General Electric’s pension fund said its investments “were made more than 10 years ago and do not currently have a market to enable an exit.” The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which in March announced it would close its Moscow office, is also in the 2012 fund. The University of Michigan has said it is seeking an exit for its various investments, but has no buyer. “Look at how many U.S. public sector pension funds were still invested in Russia, against the best advice of their own government,” Tim Ash, an emerging-markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management, said. “Maybe it’s just a case of greed overpowering fear or rational analysis.” Troubled Assets The war has snuffed out signs that interest was again growing in Russian investments. During 2021, Elbrus Capital raised $363 million of commitments to its Fund III, including from U.S. investors, and Russian financial markets enjoyed their best year for initial public offerings by both value and deal count since before Putin annexed Crimea in 2014. But other private equity investors were already rethinking their exposure. Investor Charlie Ryan failed to reach a deal to sell UFG Asset Management’s funds last year to VTB Capital amid disagreements over the value of some assets, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the talks weren’t public. A group of UFG AM’s limited partners is demanding that it shut down and distribute its assets rather than continue to collect management fees, they said. A UFG AM representative declined to comment. A number of Baring Vostok portfolio companies face a difficult future. Its fast-growing ecommerce investment, Ozon Holdings Plc, adopted a cash-intensive business model as it sought to become Russia’s answer to Amazon.com Inc. The firm went public in New York in 2020. But its shares have been frozen since the invasion, pushing $750 million in convertible bonds into technical default as some bondholders seek early repayment. Plans for Vkusvill, a food retailer focused on healthy products, to hold an initial public offering are paused with Russian capital markets effectively closed. “Russia was dicey before this and now it’s completely dicey,” said Steve Kaplan, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business.

""Results have exceeded expectations and prompted modest upward revisions to estimates for the remainder of 2022 and for 2023, driven largely by the energy sector. However, the boost to analyst estimates has not been enough to offset portfolio manager fears about the downside risk to EPS if the economy falls into recession and the downside risk to valuations as the Fed tightens policy."" Goldman also reiterated its 35% probability of a U.S. recession within two years. The cautious comments from the investment bank arrives after a major pickup in stock market volatility as traders fret about interest rate hikes, weak tech earnings, and other key risks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1,120 points last Thursday, or 3.3%. The S&P 500 tanked 3.7%. As for the Nasdaq Composite, it dropped 5.2% for its worst day since 2020. Thursday's brutal session represented a swift sentiment reversal from Wednesday, when traders breathed a sigh of relief after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank was not considering a 75 basis-point increase in interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 932.27 points and the S&P 500 gained 2.99% on Wednesday, the largest gains for the two indices since 2000. Even the beaten-up Nasdaq Composite popped 3.19%. Market volatility has extended into the new trading week. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 428 points as of 6:21 a.m. Prices for bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies continued to march lower as well. Goldman's Kostin points to other market moves as signaling rising recession fears. ""Rotations within the equity market also reflect concerns about recession risk,"" Kostin added. ""Defensive industries recently have sharply outperformed cyclical industries. The magnitude of cyclical underperformance appears consistent with a steeper economic slowdown than the recent pace of deceleration in metrics such as the ISM.""

5/9/2022,"In Q1 2022, Meta’s (FB) metaverse business — known as Reality Labs — operated at a loss of nearly $3 billion, causing skepticism in the market about whether the metaverse truly has a place in the digital future. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that costs in the present are “laying the groundwork” for this technology to hit the mainstream. In spite of the skepticism, Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon agrees that the best has yet to come for metaverse adoption and investment. “It's real, it's going to be a very big opportunity,” Amon told Yahoo Finance Live. “We started investing in fundamental technologies that allow the merger of physical and digital spaces over a decade ago. It's no secret that because of those early investments, for the over 40 virtual reality and augmented reality devices that exist in the world, [they are] all powered by Qualcomm.” Amon joined Yahoo Finance Live from the 2022 Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles in an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance’s Alexandra Garfinkle. Amon discussed the company’s presence in the auto industry, partnerships, competition, and the metaverse. And while Meta’s $3 billion bill for Reality Labs in the first quarter of 2022 may seem hefty, the business lost more than $10 billion throughout 2021. Horizon Worlds, Meta’s flagship VR social app, piloted creator monetization features late in the quarter and is expected to launch a web version to extend access to those who do not own an Oculus Quest 2 or similar headset. The platform reached a milestone of 300,000 users earlier this year. According to Amon, Qualcomm continues to maintain existing and secure new partnerships with industry giants like Meta and Microsoft (MSFT) to provide hardware and software for their extended reality (XR) businesses. “One of our biggest partnerships is with Meta,” he said. “We have had a very successful partnership with them for VR with the Quest and the Quest 2. We announced at CES that we're now doing a custom chip for augmented reality with Microsoft as the Microsoft HoloLens gets ready to scale, and we announced a partnership, for example, [a partnership] with ByteDance for VR for Tiktok.” The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.50% on Wednesday in an effort to pump the brakes on surging inflation. In light of the Fed’s hawkish interest rate hike campaign, uncertainty remains in regard to metaverse investment as investors begin to favor value over growth stocks. The issuance of exchange-traded funds like the ProShares Metaverse ETF (VERS) demonstrates that some investors, both institutional and retail, recognize the opportunity in metaverse. However, the fund and similar ETFs like it have been hammered by macroeconomic conditions. In any case, Amon maintains optimism for the future of metaverse and XR technology. “We have a number of different developments to eventually be able to create companion to your smartphone with fully immersive augmented reality glasses that actually is going to look like [normal glasses],” he said. “And I think that's a big opportunity. It could be as big as phones.” Thomas Hum is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

5/9/2022,"BTC’s price fell to as low as $34,200, on May 8. Fee reward ratio presented a dominantly bearish market-like situation for the larger crypto market. However, Tron’s TRX token rallied on bullish sentiment. Bitcoin (BTC) made lower lows, over the past four days, slipping past some of its crucial support zones as volatility and losses knew no bounds. As highlighted in a previous FXEmpire article, most top tokens like AVAX, LUNA, and AAVE registered losses on their daily and weekly charts. Strangely, however, Tron’s TRX made a power-packed comeback, rallying even as the global crypto market cap continued its downtrend. The Tron ecosystem has been on fire lately, which has ensured a bullish narrative for TRX even as the larger crypto market falls in heavy losses. Tron’s algorithmic stablecoin USDD went live last week and has since been listed on several platforms for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Tron DAO Reserve subsequently announced that it purchased 504.6 million TRX to back the algorithmic stablecoin, as the project aims to leverage a decentralized forex reserve similar to Terra’s UST reserves. On Saturday, Tron’s founder Justin Sun revealed that the team behind the project had purchased 504,600,250 TRX at an average price of 0.07727 per unit. According to the Tron DAO Reserve, this buy aims to “safeguard the overall blockchain industry and crypto market.” Notably, TRX’s price rose in tandem with the ecosystem-centric announcements. TRX’s price jumped by almost 47% since May 1 amid heightened positive social sentiment for the ecosystem and its native token. At the time of writing, TRX traded at $0.09067, noting 7.77% daily and 32.64% weekly gains. Notably, Tron following Terra’s UST reserve system for its USDD stablecoin has acted in favor of TRX’s trajectory. However, the question remains whether TRX gains could be sustained. Well, sustaining long-term gains could depend on the larger crypto market, so let us look at BTC and the larger trajectory. One of the reasons for the recent BTC losses could be short-term investors taking quick profits or exiting the market too soon. Looking at the exchange inflows for BTC, it was clear that inflows involved coins dormant for a maximum of three months and thus likely to be owned by more speculative investors. Additionally, CryptoQuant analysts suggested that the Fee/Reward Ratio indicated that we are in a bear market. Miner’s Fee to Reward Ratio is usually high during the bull market, while at its lowest point during the bear market. After BTC registered $65,000 ATH, the Fees to Reward Ratio has dropped significantly, indicating a bear market and miners’ incentive to sell their reserves to cover their expenses. Looking at the larger market’s bearish condition, it would be interesting to see how TRX’s rally pans out.
