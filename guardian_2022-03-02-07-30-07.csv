3/2/2022,"The Green Bay Packers say they have not received any trade offers for Aaron Rodgers despite speculation the quarterback may move on from the team this offseason. The 38-year-old won his second straight MVP this year but the Packers once again fell short of the Super Bowl. Rodgers has hinted that he may retire but he has also been linked to teams such as the Denver Broncos, who have draft picks they could trade and are in the market for a quarterback to complement their strong supporting cast of players. However, Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst said on Tuesday he has yet to receive a call from any other team. “Not at all,” Gutekunst said from the scouting combine in Indianapolis. “Not at all. Not a single person.” Rodgers is still to declare his intentions for the coming season but has promised to make a decision in the coming weeks. Gutekunst said he hopes to know Rodgers’ plans by 16 March, when free agency opens. “I would hope so, yeah,” Gutekunst said. “That’s obviously the start of the new league year. There’s a lot of decisions that have to be made before that. So that would be helpful. I would think we would know something before then.” The Packers are well over the league’s salary cap for the upcoming season, meaning they would struggle to build a strong team around Rodgers. On Tuesday, the Broncos said they are in the market for a quarterback and would be willing to make a trade if a suitable player was available. “We work through it. We just want the best guy,” Broncos general manager George Paton said. “We don’t care if it’s free agency; we don’t care if it’s the draft; we don’t care if it’s a trade. We’re going to exhaust all options to try to get the best guy for the Broncos.” The 2022 draft class is considered an underwhelming one in terms of quarterback talent but the Broncos, who have the No 9 pick, reportedly interviewed the top candidates, Kenny Pickett, Matt Corral and Malik Willis, on Monday. “I went to all of their live games, and you get to know them a little bit there. Then the ones who showed up at the Senior Bowl, that’s another look there. This is just another step in the process,” Paton said. “This class is an interesting class. You have five or six talented guys, and they’re all different. So we just really need to hone down and sort it out and stack them, and see who’s best for the Denver Broncos if we go that direction in the draft.”",Sport/Sport,Packers deny they have had Aaron Rodgers trade offers as Broncos hunt for QB,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/01/packers-deny-they-have-had-aaron-rodgers-trade-offers-as-broncos-hunt-for-qb
3/2/2022,"The return of Jamie Vardy to the Leicester team and scoresheet seemed an inevitability as he sealed their first win of the year with an assist and goal in his 19 minutes on the pitch to leave Burnley in the relegation zone. The former England striker came off the bench to set up the opener for his fellow substitute James Maddison before sealing victory with a close range header to prove how much the Foxes have missed him. The recently resurgent Burnley, like their broken public address system, looked faulty in the early stages. They struggled to maintain possession and should have been behind within 10 minutes when Ricardo Pereira cut in from the right and played a one-two with Marc Albrighton before driving a shot from inside the area that looked destined for the bottom corner until Nick Pope’s outstretched arm diverted the ball away to safety. There was confusion in the hosts’ usually rigid defence when Leicester were permitted to take a short corner, working the cross to the back post where James Tarkowski was waiting to head clear but the centre-back sent the ball straight up rather than out. He assumed Pope was coming to catch but the goalkeeper was nowhere to be seen, allowing Patson Daka to aim for the corner, only to see the Burnley No 1 repel the effort. Burnley thought they had opened the scoring after Aaron Lennon’s trickery defeated the Leicester defence and slid the ball across goal for Maxwel Cornet to tap into the empty net for what he thought was his first goal in almost two months. As the Ivorian turned away to celebrate, though, he caught the sight of the assistant’s raised flag, and the goal was rightly ruled out for offside. Ben Mee spent most of the half limping after a robust challenge on Daka prevented the striker running through on goal. The Burnley captain eventually had to be replaced in the 40th minute by Nathan Collins. It almost cost the hosts immediately as Harvey Barnes outsprinted the substitute before whacking a shot at goal which ricocheted off Pope’s wrist and over. Referee Chris Kavanagh had already endured the ire of Burnley assistant manager Ian Woan, who channelled his inner Frank Lampard to express some robust opinions of the officiating when he booked Wout Weghorst for his protestations after being penalised for pulling down Wilfred Ndidi on the edge of the area. The free-kick hit the Claret-decked wall not once, but twice as Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall pummelled the ball against the structure without success. Considering Leicester arrived at Turf Moor without a clean sheet away from home in the league this season, Burnley struggled to break down their defence. Their most dynamic threat came from Lennon up against Luke Thomas, a man 15 years his junior. Despite the age gap, the experienced former England international caused trouble for the full-back as he continually tried to twist and turn to get the better of the Leicester man. Cornet got the better of the back four legally in the 69th minute when he latched on to a delicate McNeil through ball. The forward used a burst of pace to reach the pass but under pressure from Caglar Soyuncu could only toe poke a shot meekly past Kasper Schmeichel and wide of the Leicester goal. Leicester’s response to what had increasingly looked like stalemate was to bring on Vardy for his first appearance of the year after recovering from a hamstring injury. He decided to test his muscles with an acrobatic bicycle kick from eight yards out but it was more rusty Penny Farthing than BMX in its execution as the ball sailed high into the stand. Pope made another stunning save after Harvey Barnes cut in from the left to curl a shot across the goalkeeper towards the top corner but the sprawling goalkeeper palmed it wide. There was nothing he could do moments later when Vardy stayed onside to collect a Schmeichel clearance, before laying the ball off to Maddison who drove at goal and picked out the bottom corner. Vardy put the result beyond doubt as he headed into an empty net after good work on the left by Barnes.",Sport/Football,Leicester’s James Maddison and Jamie Vardy keep Burnley in bottom three,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/01/burnley-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report
3/2/2022,"My mother, Dee Humphries, who has died aged 88, was an inspirational science teacher whose love of travel brought her to the UK from her homeland in New Zealand, and who maintained her wanderlust well into old age. She was born in Dunedin to Constance Bryant (nee Shannon), and then adopted at the age of two weeks by Cyril Sharp, who worked for the New Zealand General Post Office, and his wife, Rene (nee Butcher). Raised in Waimate, she attended Waimate high school before graduating with a science degree from Otago University in 1955, followed by teacher training. Her first teaching job came in 1957 at Christchurch Technical College. She combined this with working part-time as a costume maker for the theatre director and crime writer Ngaio Marsh, a job that inspired her passion for theatre. In 1959 she embarked on what was supposed to be a short trip, via Asia, to the UK, but which took her away from New Zealand for the rest of her life. She settled in London in Earls Court, taking up a teaching position at the Elliott school in Putney and taught evening classes in Notting Hill. However, the desire to see more of the world soon re-emerged, and she left London for Turkey, where she taught at the Darüssafaka school for orphaned boys in Istanbul. It was there that she met Michael Humphries, a Briton and fellow teacher at the school, who turned out to be a kindred spirit. They married in 1962 in Istanbul and travelled at every opportunity, visiting Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine and Iran, often searching out ancient ruins in their 2CV car. In 1963 Michael and Dee returned to settle in Wimbledon in south-west London, where they continued to teach and travel while bringing up three children. Dee was soon appointed head of department at Pelham middle school, and then Park House middle school, both in Wimbledon, and eventually became a science teaching inspector for the London borough of Merton. Every school holiday was spent travelling across Europe, to Turkey and beyond. Michael died in 1991. At the age of 66 Dee signed up with Voluntary Service Overseas, becoming one of their oldest volunteers. She volunteered to work in Eritrea and set up the science teacher training programme there. Living in the small village of Tsada Christian, outside the capital, Asmara, she cycled all over the surrounding area, making quite an impression and many friends. After three years in Eritrea she returned to Wimbledon and continued to wave the flag for VSO by giving talks. She was a governor at Rutlish school in Merton, a trustee of the charity Prisoners Abroad, and a member of the Patient Quality Health Forum at St George’s hospital in Tooting. At home she loved jewellery-making, batik, pottery and sewing, and theatre was an almost weekly event. Dee also continued to travel into old age, including to Iran, Libya, China, Tibet, Thailand and Costa Rica, before severe arthritis and dementia restricted her movements. Her favourite saying was: “I must box on.” She is survived by her three children, me, Lynne and Mark, and four grandchildren.",News/Education,Dee Humphries obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/01/dee-humphries-obituary
3/2/2022,"The United States and 30 countries have agreed to release 60m barrels of oil from their strategic reserves to stabilise global energy markets, the US Department of Energy said on Tuesday, as oil prices surged to a seven-year high. The move, ahead of Joe Biden’s State of the Union address to Congress, failed to calm fears about supply disruption from the Ukraine crisis and sanctions against Russia. US stock markets fell sharply even after the news. Oil prices surged after the announcement, with US crude hitting its highest level since June 2014 as Russia bears down on Ukraine’s capital. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the US oil benchmark, jumped 11.3% to $106.50 a barrel before dropping back to $105. International benchmark Brent crude advanced 9.5% to trade at $107 – the highest since July 2014 – before falling to $103. The price surge marks a return to oil prices pushing through the $100-mark since last Thursday when Russia invaded Ukraine. An energy squeeze in what is already a tight market has some analysts fearing oil could top $150 in the coming months. Biden has repeatedly sought to prepare US consumers for higher gas prices. “I will not pretend this will be painless,” he said on Tuesday, adding that his administration was “prepared to deploy all the tools and authority at our disposal to provide relief at the gas pump”. OPEC and its oil-producing allies, which includes Russia, are set to meet this week to discuss output for April. Morgan Stanley raised its near-term oil price forecasts, saying the events in Ukraine have introduced a “risk premium in oil prices that is likely to remain in coming months”. The bank now sees Brent averaging $110 in the second quarter of the year, up from a prior forecast of $100. Under the firm’s most upbeat case, prices will jump to $125. “Against a backdrop of market tightness, even small disruptions can have large price impacts,” the firm added. The coordinated decision – the fourth such effort in the International Energy Agency (IEA)’s history – to release 60m barrels of oil from global reserves is unlikely to have an immediate impact on oil prices. US strategic reserves are held in Texas caves, and not immediately accessible to refiners. US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm said the US, which released 30m barrels, was “prepared to take additional measures if conditions warrant. “The situation in energy markets is very serious and demands our full attention,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a statement. “Global energy security is under threat, putting the world economy at risk during a fragile stage of the recovery.” According to the agency, the 60m barrel release accounts for 4% of members’ emergency stockpiles of 1.5bn barrels. The number is equivalent to about six days of Russian production, and about 12 days of Russia’s exports. “60m barrels isn’t that much. That’s the bottom line at the end of the day,” Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA, told CNBC. He noted that 60m barrels does little to meaningfully move the needle and is not enough to absorb lost supply from Russia. However, Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth, said that while the move was expected, it could offer a “modest buffer in the short term”. “It is not meaningless, it simply pales in comparison to a true supply disruption from Russia,” Babin added. US and European trade sanctions on Russia leave exemptions for energy, with Europe as a whole reliant on Russia for around one third of its oil and gas imports. But a recent deal between Moscow and Beijing to supply surplus Russian gas to China suggests there are available work-arounds if western sanctions are extended to energy. On 2 February, Russia and China agreed a 30-year contract to supply gas to China via a new pipeline and will settle the new gas sales in euros. The deal, between Gazprom and the Chinese state energy major CNPC, is for 10bn cubic metres of gas a year. Under previous agreements, Russia will supply China with 38 bcm of gas by pipeline by 2025. But the new deal, signed during Russian president Putin’s visit to the Beijing Winter Olympics, increases the commitment. Last year, Russia exported 16.5 bcm of gas to China via its Power of Siberia pipeline, which began pumping supplies in 2019, and by shipping liquefied natural gas (LNG). A new pipeline connecting Russia’s Far East region with north-east China is due to begin transmission in two to three years. In the event of western sanctions on Russian oil, Chinese companies are expected to take advantage of discounted Russian oil. Russia is currently China’s third-largest supplier of seaborne crude after Saudi Arabia and Iraq, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In January, imports averaged 811,000 barrels a day. Ukraine has called for oil and gas sales to stop, with Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign affairs minister, calling for an embargo. On Monday, BP said it would sell its stake in Rosneft PJSC, and Shell is dropping out of a Russian gas project. But China, says energy analysts, is no stranger to devising work-arounds to western sanctions, including buying cheap oil from US-sanctioned regimes in Iran and Venezuela. “China is likely to continue buying Russian crude both for its operational needs and for restocking,” Michal Meidan​, director of the China Energy Research Programme at Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, told Bloomberg Tuesday. “Even if it’s sanctioned, it can settle oil in yuan or rubles and, as we have seen with Iran and Venezuela, some buyers that do not have international exposure can work around sanctions,” said Meidan.",News/Business,US and 30 allied countries to release 60m barrels of oil amid price surge,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/01/oil-reserve-release-barrels-price-surge-crisis
3/2/2022,"The outcome was entirely predictable but Manchester City were given a game before passing to the FA Cup quarter-finals. Superb second-half goals from Riyad Mahrez and Jack Grealish saw off Championship strugglers Peterborough, who had feared greater punishment but had their moments. The home side created a couple of presentable chances to complicate City’s task but will reflect survival is possible if they complete the season with this energy. Nobody went away too unhappy and there was also the touching sight of Oleksandr Zinchenko, City’s captain for the night, being given an ovation by all sides of the ground. At the outset this bore the necessary ingredients for Cup theatre: first in the top flight against bottom of the second; a team of decorated internationals against opponents who were largely young, raw and full of running; a careworn, rutted pitch; tight stands and a boisterous, packed terrace of home fans behind one goal. There was an extra ingredient, though, that put everyone on the same page. Pep Guardiola had given Zinchenko the armband, saying the Ukrainian would “represent his country”, and the sentiment towards him and his compatriots before kick-off was heartfelt. The entire stadium applauded when Zinchenko’s name was read out, while Peterborough’s mascot ran around the pitch bearing a Ukraine flag. The same blue and yellow standard could be seen waving in sections of the away end, and another was carried onto the pitch by Zinchenko and the home captain, Frankie Kent. Zinchenko took City’s first two shots of the game but both, aimed with his right foot, were too high. Mahrez ballooned behind from a favourable position on the right, possibly hindered by the surface, and while City’s possession share was predictably hefty during the first 20 minutes there was always enough danger on the break from Peterborough to keep them honest. Grant McCann’s side could even claim the closest call of that spell when Jeando Fuchs, a Cameroonian midfielder, escaped down the right and saw Ederson tip wide after his drive had deflected off a sliding Nathan Aké. Shortly afterwards Aké was booked for stopping the striker Ricky Jade-Jones in full flight and, while Peterborough were forced to hack away the obligatory stream of cutbacks, they were beginning to enjoy themselves. Kwame Poku saw a shot blocked and, more than once, the hosts worked themselves opportunities to run at City with slick moves. They were not required to hold hearts in mouths until the half-hour, when Ilkay Gündogan whipped just wide of Steven Benda’s far post. A minute later Grealish, starting his first match since the fourth round tie against Fulham last month, was higher and wider from a better position after working space just inside the area. Gündogan headed a half-chance past the post as half-time approached but City had not forced a save from Benda when the teams went back in and the home fans, who watched their team lose 3-0 to Hull here on Saturday, had made no bones about reminding them of the ignominy that would result from failure to win. Guardiola decided that swapping his centre-backs at half-time, introducing Aymeric Laporte and John Stones for Aké and Rúben Dias, would enhance City’s chances of avoiding such an outcome. Fernandinho dropped back between them as a de facto sweeper and it was not completely fanciful, given Peterborough had lined up with a back three, to suggest the City manager had decided to match his less decorated opposition up. When Sammie Szmodics pulled wide from a glorious position three minutes after the restart, followed soon after by a superbly-timed block from Phil Foden when Jorge Grant had poised himself to convert, it seemed as if Guardiola might have over-tinkered. Peterborough’s tails were up and they were applying genuine pressure: City were finding it hard to construct anything and as the hour mark approached there was a sense that, against all odds, this tie was in the balance. Naturally enough, that feeling was promptly whipped away. Mahrez had been off beam for most of the evening but, after picking up a ricochet to the right of the area, he cut inside as is his wont. With minimal backlift he nursed an effort around and beyond Benda, who seemed to be caught out by the early shot. Now any doubt about the outcome was minimal and, after Mahrez and Gabriel Jesus had spurned further chances, Grealish made sure. Found sublimely by Foden, he brought the ball down and finished low to score only his fourth goal for City. Ederson denied the substitute Jack Marriott a goal Peterborough would have deserved. Laporte missed a sitter before the end, but it mattered little.",Sport/Football,Man City’s Mahrez and Grealish break Peterborough resistance in FA Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/01/peterborough-manchester-fa-cup-fifth-round-match-report

Britain’s public broadcaster is also requesting the remaining episodes of two programmes, Dancing with the Stars and David Attenborough’s The Green Planet, are not aired on Russian state TV, despite the rights to both having already been sold. The TV sector has joined many others in distancing itself from Russia as western countries increase sanctions against the nation. A spokesperson for the BBC said: “The BBC’s executive team were meeting today and they have decided to stop all content licensing to Russian customers.” ITV also announced it will cease working with Russian clients following the invasion.

A spokesperson said: “Pact calls for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine and for a resolution of conflict by diplomatic means respecting the rule of law and the rights of the Ukrainian people. “Whilst Pact sympathises with Russian creatives who do not have the same freedoms and safeguards that we enjoy in the United Kingdom, Pact has removed all Russian production and business information from its website and calls on members to suspend all co-operation and trade with Russia for the time being.” Several major Hollywood entertainment companies, including Warner Bros, Sony Pictures and The Walt Disney Company, have paused the release of films in Russia in response to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.",News/Media,BBC stops all content licensing in Russia following Ukraine invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/01/bbc-stops-all-content-licensing-in-russia-following-ukraine-invasion
3/2/2022,"Not much happens in Somebody Somewhere (Sky Comedy), but don’t let that deceive you. This comedy is a stealthy new arrival that doesn’t shout about its charms, but rather lets them unfurl steadily, with surprising beauty. It drops us into the life of Sam (Bridget Everett), a woman in her 40s who has recently moved back to her home town of Manhattan – not that one, Manhattan, Kansas. She returned to take care of her dying sister, but now that her sister is gone, she finds herself stuck, purposeless and lonely. There is a telltale colour palette to comedies like this, washed out and pale, a sign that the comedy label should be in inverted commas. Like Better Things, Work in Progress and Mrs Fletcher, this is more “if you don’t laugh, you’ll cry” than slapstick-punchline, laugh-track funny; anyone expecting a straightforward gag may need to look elsewhere. Everett plays Sam as lost and weary. She has a morbidly silent job marking exam papers, and the closest person to her now is her niece, Shannon, much to the dismay of Shannon’s mother. The first episode involves some scene-setting: Sam’s mother drinks too much, and her surviving sister is a pressure-cooker of emotions. Life is not so bad that it is harrowing, but the monotony is wearing Sam down. When Sam meets Joel at work, a hint of brightness begins to return to her life. Joel (a fantastic Jeff Hiller) idolised Sam when they were at school together. She doesn’t remember him, but they were both in “show choir”, which I assume is basically drama club with a focus on songs. Sam was a star of show choir, her Peter Gabriel performance legendary even now. Joel is a pianist at church and takes Sam along to one of the secret cabaret-ish nights he puts on there, while telling the pastor that it is choir practice. Inevitably, Sam starts to exercise her lungs and dive back into her old, long-forgotten talents. Small towns or working-class communities sometimes seem to get a rough ride on television, treated either as crime scenes or with big-city disdain, but this is truthful and affectionate. Everett, who grew up in Manhattan, Kansas herself, has described the show as like an alternate version of her life had she not moved away, and there is an intimacy that shines through. As a show about found family, rather than the one we are given, this is gorgeous. Sam and Joel’s friendship is honest and warm, and could be just what Sam needs. If Somebody Somewhere sounds sentimental, it is smart enough to take some sandpaper to the edges. Sam is a brittle person, still grieving, overwhelmed by family drama, and there are moments of cruelty and bad behaviour that are painfully observed. Maybe its Sky Comedy home is a bit of a stretch, but it does find gentle humour in absurd, everyday moments. Her dad farts during an apparently profound chat. A former classmate writes a memoir of her time in show choir, and calls it Showgirls. “Does she not know about Showgirls?” asks a friend, incredulous. This is television that asks big questions on the sly. Sam finds herself completely untethered. She has a job that is not the career she had hoped for. She still sleeps on her dead sister’s sofa. Her idea of a weekend is drinking wine in her pants which, says Joel, sounds kind of lonely. “What are you doing with your life?” asks Sam’s other sister, and Somebody Somewhere tries to answer it. It could have taken the easy path: rags to riches, sadness to happiness, loneliness to friendship. But it chooses a bumpier road and is much lovelier for it. As the series progresses, just like Sam, it starts to find a remarkable voice.",Arts/Television & radio,"Somebody Somewhere review – a warm, honest and surprisingly beautiful TV comedy ",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/01/somebody-somewhere-review-a-warm-honest-and-surprisingly-beautiful-tv-comedy
3/2/2022,"A businessman who arranged the flight that crashed into the Channel, killing footballer Emiliano Sala, failed to check if the pilot was qualified to fly the plane, an inquest has heard. Sala, 28, died along with 59-year-old pilot David Ibbotson when the single-engine aircraft crashed near Guernsey during a flight from Frances to Wales in January 2019. The inquest previously heard Sala was overcome by toxic levels of carbon monoxide poisoning prior to dying from severe head and chest injuries consistent with a plane crash. The Argentinian striker had recently signed for Premier League club Cardiff City from French Ligue 1 side Nantes for £15m. David Henderson, a businessman and former RAF pilot, organised private return flights taking Sala between Cardiff and Nantes on behalf of football agent Willie McKay, a long-term associate. Dorset coroner’s court heard that Ibbotson’s private licence did not allow him to fly passengers commercially and charge for his services. When asked by senior Dorset coroner Rachael Griffin if he had verified Ibbotson’s qualifications, Henderson said: “I just took him at his word that he was an experienced pilot. I had flown with him a couple of times and he was proficient.” Griffin asked: “Did you even ask to see his licence?” Henderson replied: “No.” The Piper Malibu plane was owned by Cool Flourish, a trust fund run by Fay Keely and her family. Henderson told the hearing he had a verbal agreement with Keely to manage the plane on her behalf, arranging flights with clients over the phone, which he would take himself or find another pilot to handle. Speaking at the hearing, Keely said she first became aware of Ibbotson flying the plane after receiving two infringement notices from the Civil Aviation Authority in the summer of 2018. She told Henderson in an email that she did not want Ibbotson flying the plane again, to which he responded with “multiple expletives”, she said. Henderson said he would have spoken to Ibbotson about the infringement notices and “smoothed it out” with Keely, who told the jury she could not recall such a conversation. Henderson was asked about an email to Keely in which he apologised for using Ibbotson to fly her sister. “I think generally people preferred me to fly them and I was apologising for not being able to do it myself,” he said. The last maintenance check on the plane was carried out in November 2018 and Henderson said it was airworthy. He “could not recall” whether he had flown the Piper Malibu in the months between the last service and the crash. The inquest continues.",Sport/Football,"Emiliano Sala flight organiser did not check pilot was qualified, inquest hears ",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/01/emiliano-sala-flight-organiser-did-not-check-pilot-was-qualified-inquest-hears
