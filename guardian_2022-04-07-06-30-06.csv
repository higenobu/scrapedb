4/7/2022,"Everton might not be ever-presents in the Premier League for much longer. A team with acute problems on the road lost their way and their lead. They could find themselves in the bottom three on Sunday, while Burnley glimpse a route out of trouble. After registering just three wins all season, they conjured a comeback victory, courtesy of Maxwel Cornet’s decider, and with a trip to Norwich next, may record two in a week. Everton’s sixth successive away defeat may be their most damaging yet. Their advantage over Burnley is cut to a solitary point and their 68-year stay in the top flight has rarely been as endangered. Even a remarkable performance by Richarlison, who scored twice, was not enough for Frank Lampard. Drenched by the swirling rain, he looked beleaguered as his side were beaten. When these sides met in September, Everton’s victory took them level on points with the leaders. Suffice to say much has changed in the intervening seven months. The importance of the occasion brought a sense of urgency, but there was precious little accuracy as wayward passes showed why both these teams have among the lowest pass completion rates in the division. This shaped up as one of those rare games when Burnley have more of the ball. Perhaps Sean Dyche sensed Everton’s frailties when he named an unusually attacking lineup. Maxwel Cornet started on the left wing as the out-of-form Dwight McNeil was omitted. Jay Rodriguez returned, ending Saturday’s flirtation with 4-4-2. And yet, while two attackers came into the team, the scorer of Burnley’s fourth goal in 12 games was a recalled defender. Back after suspension, Nathan Collins opened his Clarets account with a volley after Cornet’s deep corner. For Everton, set-piece problems were the recurrence of a depressingly familiar theme. For Alex Iwobi, who lost his bearings and Collins alike, it was a second costly error in four days: he was also culpable for West Ham’s winner at the weekend. Burnley’s own self-destructive streak was also quickly demonstrated. Ashley Westwood’s evening had begun promisingly as he almost put Burnley ahead with a curler. It soon deteriorated. Westwood tugged needlessly and rather ineffectually at Anthony Gordon. The Everton winger took the opportunity to go to ground and Richarlison rolled in the penalty. The Brazilian’s drought has been a cause of Everton’s troubles but he looked buoyed by his first goal in 11 games. Cutting in from the left, he had a shot deflected over. He almost supplied Dominic Calvert-Lewin with a simple finish. He brought Everton dominance on their left flank and when it yielded a second spot-kick, the surprise was that he and the tormented Connor Roberts were not the protagonists. Instead, the former Everton winger Aaron Lennon tripped Vitalii Mykolenko and, after Mike Dean was sent to the monitor to review the decision, a second penalty was awarded. The decision to install Richarlison as penalty-taker after Calvert-Lewin missed against Brighton was further endorsed as he sent Nick Pope the wrong way for a second time. The second half began as the first ended, with Burnley pressure interrupted by Everton’s searing counterattacks. Richarlison set about sprinting past Roberts with conspicuous ease but fired wide. When Jonjoe Kenny’s cross took flight and bounced off the post, Richarlison almost converted the rebound. A miss proved a turning point. Charlie Taylor surged to the byline and drilled a low cross into the six-yard box. Rodriguez arrived unchecked to finish. It was just a second goal in 39 league games for the homegrown forward and he was serenaded by the Burnley fans. Everton had been creaking, perhaps unsurprisingly with the callow Jarrad Branthwaite, their fifth-choice centre-back, pressed in for the suspended Michael Keane, and the defender Mason Holgate having to act as the holding midfielder. Richarlison resumed his one-man assault on the Burnley goal, with Pope parrying an overhead kick. When the Brazilian released Anthony Gordon, James Tarkowski flew in to block his shot. The value of it soon became apparent. Dyche sent for Matej Vydra and he got the assist for the winner, with Everton architects of their own downfall. Jordan Pickford sliced the ball out for a throw, then Ben Godfrey sliced an attempted clearance. Vydra crossed and Cornet lifted his shot into the roof of the net.",Sport/Football,Maxwel Cornet pounces late for Burnley to pile misery on endangered Everton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/06/burnley-everton-premier-league-match-report
4/7/2022,"Marcus Smith believes his Six Nations experiences with England, coping with the high-pressure visits to Paris and Murrayfield, have boosted his confidence that Harlequins can take the fight to Montpellier in the first leg of their Champions Cup last-16 tie on Sunday. After starring for an hour in Harlequins’ 41-14 win at London Irish on Sunday, when he set up two of his team’s seven tries, the in-form Smith recognises that a squad with 14 French internationals and two World Cup winners in their ranks are not to be underestimated. “It’s the biggest tournament in Europe for a club player,” he said. “We don’t want to just take part, we want to win the silverware. We’ve got to fight as they’re a brilliant team and they’re going to throw everything at us.” Montpellier are top of the French Top 14 but stumbled into the last 16 of Europe’s premier club competition, finishing seventh in their group. Quins won all four of their pool games but Smith knows they will have to raise their game. “I know it’ll be the best version of Montpellier,” he said. “As a group we’re excited for that challenge. We’ll try to take them out of their comfort zone and throw something at them they haven’t seen before. “That’s the one positive of this group. We’re not fazed by anyone, we back ourselves as individuals and as a group. We’ll work hard this week to put out a cohesive performance, and try to score as many points [as we can] then worry about the second leg. If we can go down there and score four tries we give ourselves a brilliant chance coming back to the Stoop.” The confidence Smith so effortlessly exudes is what has endeared him to the English public and his dazzling skillset carried Harlequins to a thrilling Premiership victory last year. However, a disappointing return in the Six Nations offered valuable lessons that can only be derived from defeat. “I learned a lot from playing in high-pressure environments like away at Murrayfield and away in France,” Smith said, recalling two of the three losses that consigned England to third in the championship. “They were both tough places to go and I learned a lot of lessons about myself, as well as how we can improve as a group. “First and foremost about my mentality going to these places. You get a lot of stick as an Englishman at Murrayfield. I didn’t realise. Maybe I was a bit naive going up there and thinking it would be plain sailing. It was a tough Test match. “I learned about how to control myself in big moments, pressure moments, which I will try to bring back here, hopefully for knockout games with Harlequins.” Along with Eddie Jones’s overall strategy, England’s attack was heavily criticised after the tournament. Smith said he took that to heart as the team’s fly-half, which is why he has relished his return to the familiar environment of his club. “When I first came back after our week off, the energy was brilliant, the vibe was brilliant and it was a pleasure to be back,” he said, crediting the recent break he took in Dubai after his time with England. “It took me a couple of days in training to get the calls right and get the timing right off the boys.” His relationship with Danny Care inside him, as well as with the aggressive ball-carriers off his shoulder in Alex Dombrandt and André Esterhuizen, came to the fore against Irish. That 8-9-10-12 axis has been at the heart of Harlequins’ recent success. Add in Joe Marchant, a constant threat running a spate of threatening lines, and the reigning Premiership champions have one of the most potent attacks in Europe. “It was an absolute joy to step back into training and play the Quins way, which is what I’ve been doing since I was 14,” Smith said of the free-flowing rugby that has become a hallmark of a team whose style is the antithesis of England under Jones.",Sport/Sport,Marcus Smith hopeful tough England trips can benefit Harlequins,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/06/marcus-smith-england-trips-can-benefit-harlequins-rugby-champions-cup
4/7/2022,"Sometimes the old ones are the best. By the end, the notion that Chelsea would blow Real Madrid away felt utterly preposterous. Sometimes there is nothing else to do but sit back and marvel at the majesty of Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and Karim Benzema, whose clinical hat-trick leaves Chelsea’s defence of their European title hanging by a thread. This was a regal display from Madrid’s thirtysomethings. Carlo Ancelotti, a veteran of these clashes, outwitted Thomas Tuchel. Modric and Kroos were magnificent in midfield. Chelsea did not know where to look and they could be in for a humiliation if they continue to give a striker of Benzema’s gifts this many chances when this quarter-final resumes at the Bernabéu next week. Yet there had been a sense that Madrid would not be able to live with Chelsea’s power. The Spaniards had struggled physically when these sides met in the last four last season and it was clear Tuchel wanted to play on that history. The emphasis on speed from Chelsea was obvious from Tuchel’s decision to pick his most mobile front three, Mason Mount and Christian Pulisic buzzing urgently around Kai Havertz, and at first it was hard not to fear for Madrid’s chances in midfield, where the energy of N’Golo Kanté was expected to push Casemiro, Kroos and Modric to the limit. Indeed the signs for Chelsea were encouraging when Mount rattled into Kroos after eight minutes. At that stage, with the German lying on the turf and perhaps wondering if he had the legs for this, Madrid appeared to be in trouble. Chelsea were pressing ferociously and it seemed that something had to give when Havertz pushed Eder Militão off the ball, forcing the Madrid centre-back to drag the German down and concede a free-kick that allowed Reece James to increase the pressure by drawing a fine save from Thibaut Courtois. Yet perhaps Chelsea got carried away. They defended terribly when they lost 4-1 to Brentford on Saturdday and Madrid soon found space to create. There was a warning when Benzema and Fede Valverde released Vinícius Junior on the left, only for the winger to ram his shot against the bar after swerving inside Andreas Christensen, and it was telling that Tuchel had grown edgy even before the opening goal arrived, the German unable to hide his irritation at how much room Madrid had on the break every time Chelsea gave away possession. Soon it was Madrid who were in charge, the ageing trio of Modric, Kroos and Casemiro beginning to pull the strings in midfield. The mood had changed and Chelsea were not quick enough to smell danger. They did not seem to realise that Madrid had identified James as a weak link on the right. There was too much space behind the Chelsea wing-back and that frailty would prove pivotal in the 21st minute, the dangerous Vinícius playing a stunning double one-two with Benzema and crossing for the France striker to send a glorious header beyond Édouard Mendy. It was a superb goal, made possible by Benzema’s ability to drop deep and link play, and Madrid soon pulled further clear. Valverde, preferred to Marco Asensio on the right, played the ball back to Modric and when nobody closed the Croatian down he swung the ball in for Benzema, who peeled away from Antonio Rüdiger, Thiago Silva and Christensen before beating Mendy with another lovely header. All over the place at the back, Chelsea needed a rethink. The crowd was silent and although the hosts halved the deficit before the break, Havertz heading Jorginho’s bending ball past Thibaut Courtois, it still did not feel particularly convincing. It was certainly difficult to fool Tuchel, especially as Benzema still had time to spurn a glaring chance before half-time. Kanté and Jorginho had been poor in midfield. Christensen, who is expected to join Barcelona this summer, lacked focus. Pulisic and Mount had done little. César Azpilicueta, out of position at left wing-back, was struggling to track Valverde’s runs inside. Ancelotti, who only travelled to London on Wednesday morning, had clearly spent his time in quarantine coming up with a clever plan. Madrid were toying with Chelsea and Tuchel was quick to make adjustments, Mateo Kovacic and Hakim Ziyech replacing Kanté and Christensen at half-time. Unfortunately nobody will ever be able to tell if those substitutions were the right ones. They felt irrelevant when Mendy, whose distribution has been shaky for a while, came out of his area to mop up a long ball in the 46th minute and sold Rüdiger short with a dreadful pass, a hush falling over the stadium as Benzema nipped in and completed his hat-trick by rolling the ball into the empty net from 25 yards. Chelsea were deflated. They tried to muster a fightback but they had none of Madrid’s poise. It was a mess, summed up by Romelu Lukaku missing a sitter after coming off the bench.",Sport/Football,Karim Benzema hat-trick for Real Madrid puts Chelsea on brink of exit,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/06/chelsea-real-madrid-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report
4/7/2022,"Good morning. NSW health workers will go on a statewide strike, while the country is waiting for Scott Morrison to call the federal election. Anthony Albanese has called on the government to expel Russian diplomats, saying the “sickening abuses being carried out by Russian forces” in Ukraine must trigger “immediate diplomatic consequences”. The Labor leader suggested a model in which the ambassador, Alexey Pavlovsky, would probably be able to remain in place, but some of his subordinates would be forced to leave. To date, the government has stopped short of expelling diplomats to keep open direct lines of communication. Government sources said expulsions had “always been on the table” and the latest reports of atrocities would be taken into account. Fresh sanctions targeting Russian banks and elites and trading have been announced by the US, UK and EU. US sanctions also target two daughters of Vladimir Putin, as well as Russia’s biggest public and private banks, as part of a western effort to starve funds to Putin’s war machine. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán gave a press conference in which he said he had offered to broker talks with Putin aimed at a ceasefire, while stopping short of agreeing to extend EU sanctions against oil and gas shipments. Russia’s military has now shifted its focus to the east of Ukraine, with authorities warning residents to leave “while the opportunity still exists” before a massive assault. The sale and promotion of e-cigarettes to young people must be banned, the Australian Council on Smoking and Health says, after the most comprehensive review yet of vaping harms, which found conclusive evidence of poisoning, injuries, burns and immediate toxicity through inhalation. The review found strong evidence that e-cigarettes increased tobacco smoking uptake in non-smokers and limited evidence that nicotine e-cigarettes help smokers quit cigarettes. An inquest into the 2017 disappearance of Northern Territory man Paddy Moriarty has heard secret police recordings of a man allegedly saying: “I struck him on the fucking head and killerated the bastard … basherated him.” Michael Towke claims a serving federal cabinet minister texted him ‘I believe you’ and ‘do what you need to do, just be careful’ after he alleged that in 2007 Morrison suggested he couldn’t be trusted because he was Lebanese. People who listen to podcasts are more likely to be curious, more open to experience and less neurotic on average than non-listeners, a study suggests. Sri Lanka’s 22 million residents are facing the imminent threat of starvation as the country’s economic crisis continues to worsen and threaten food security, a politician has warned. The economic crisis has also deteriorated into a medical crisis, with the top medical union declaring a national health emergency over a life-threatening shortage of drugs. Scientists have developed a blood test that can predict whether someone is at high risk of a heart attack, stroke, heart failure – or dying from one of these conditions within the next four years. Boris Johnson has said he does not “think that biological males should be competing in female sporting events” amid the fallout from his decision not to ban conversion practices for people questioning their gender. German police have raided alleged neo-Nazi cells across the country. Four people were arrested after more than 1,000 officers swooped on homes of 50 suspects. “The RBA’s decade without a rate rise is coming to an end – but the market’s expectations are absurd,” writes Greg Jericho. “A 3% cash rate, let alone one next year, would likely destroy the economy and the housing market. A 3.25% cash rate would effectively see the current average discount mortgage rate go from 3.45% to around 6.6%. But such a rate would be rather more detrimental than in 2012 when the rate was last that high. It would actually be the most crushing rate we’ve experienced since 1990s’ 17% rates.” Zoë Coombs Marr’s character Dave has woken from a coma and everything since 2016 is new to him. He has missed the #MeToo movement, JK Rowling’s pivot from beloved to controversial, the entire pandemic and thousands of new cultural references. Coombs Marr’s new show, The Opener, asks how would Dave respond to all of that? “A lot has happened while Dave has been in a coma, but a lot has also happened in the months since Coombs Marr began trialling this show earlier in the year. It is little wonder then, that The Opener lacks the polish I’ve come to expect from her shows,” writes Alexandra Neill. “Despite its faults, this is still a show worth seeing. Coombs Marr’s absurdist and theatrical approach to standup is refreshing.” The ABC journalist and comedian Ange Lavoipierre has reached a kind of peace with the internet. “For me, the internet is like a fetid lake that looks uninviting from the shore – but surprise! The temperature is perfect. I enjoy swimming in the lake, but my enjoyment is undermined by the fact that I am often forced to swim for long periods of time … sometimes I have to swim to shore without a lifejacket.” Though the wading is tough, Lavoipierre has always found a laugh. Here are the top 10 funniest things on the internet that she could think of. With the election due to be called at any moment, Scott Morrison has denied allegations from Liberal MPs that he is a bully, and that he previously made “racial comments” about a Liberal candidate. In today’s Full Story, Guardian Australia’s political editor, Katharine Murphy, speaks to Laura Murphy-Oates about what’s behind this revolt, and what it could mean for the election.
