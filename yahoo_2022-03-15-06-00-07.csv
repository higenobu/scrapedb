3/15/2022,"* 12 missiles hit Erbil, some land near new U.S. consulate * Missiles caused only material damage, one civilian injured * No damage to U.S. facilities, U.S. State Dept spokesman says * Iraqi security official says missiles made in Iran * Iran's Revolutionary Guards claim responsibility for attack (Adds Iraq summons Iran ambassador, context) By Amina Ismail and John Davison ERBIL, Iraq, March 13 (Reuters) - Iran attacked Iraq's northern city of Erbil on Sunday with a dozen ballistic missiles in an unprecedented assault on the capital of the autonomous Iraqi Kurdish region that appeared to target the United States and its allies. The missiles came down in areas near a new U.S. consulate building, according to Kurdish officials. U.S. officials said no Americans were hurt and nor were U.S. facilities hit. Kurdish authorities said only one civilian was hurt and no one killed. Iranian state media said Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps carried out the attack against Israeli ""strategic centres"" in Erbil, suggesting it was revenge for recent Israeli air strikes that killed Iranian military personnel in Syria. The attack, in which huge blasts shook windows of homes in Erbil after midnight, was a rare publicly declared assault by Tehran against allies of Washington. The last time Iran fired missiles directly at U.S. facilities was when it struck the Ain Al Asad air base in western Iraq in January 2020 - a retaliation for the U.S. killing of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani. Sunday's attack comes as talks to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal face the prospect of collapse after a last-minute Russian demand forced world powers to pause negotiations for an undetermined time despite having a largely completed text. It also comes days after Israel carried out an air raid in Syria which the IRGC said killed two of its members and for which it vowed retaliation. 'RESPONSE TO ISRAEL' The IRGC issued a statement about Sunday's attack which was reported by Iranian state media. ""Any repetition of attacks by Israel will be met with a harsh, decisive and destructive response,"" it said. The Iraqi Kurdish regional government said the attack only targeted civilian residential areas, not sites belonging to foreign countries, and called on the international community to carry out an investigation. Iraq's foreign ministry summoned the Iranian ambassador to Baghdad in protest. A U.S. State Department spokesperson called it an ""outrageous attack"" but said no Americans were hurt and there was no damage to U.S. government facilities in Erbil. France's foreign ministry said the move threatened efforts to conclude nuclear talks with Iran. In another sign of derailing regional diplomacy, Iran said on Sunday it was suspending a fifth round of talks due this week in Baghdad with regional rival Saudi Arabia. U.S. forces stationed in a section of the Erbil International Airport complex have in the past come under fire from rocket and drone attacks that Washington blames on Iran-aligned militia groups, but no such attacks have occurred for several months. Asked about Sunday's attack, Israel's military said it did not comment on reports in the foreign press and the prime minister's office declined to comment. BATTLEFIELD IRAQ Iran has not fired ballistic missiles at U.S. forces since its January 2020 retaliation attack after the U.S. killing earlier that month of Soleimani at Baghdad airport. No U.S. personnel were killed in that attack but many suffered head injuries. Iran-backed Shi'ite Islamist militias have since Soleimani's death regularly attacked U.S. forces stationed in Iraq and neighbouring Syria. Washington has on occasion retaliated with air strikes. Some observers said Sunday's attack was retaliation against Israel and not aimed at the United States. ""Iran had carried out attacks against American targets and did not shy away from publicizing this,"" said Hamidreza Azizi, Visiting Fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. ""I see this more as a warning sign to Israel and a show of force in the negotiations."" Iraq has been rocked by chronic instability since the defeat of the Sunni Islamist group Islamic State in 2017 by a loose coalition of Iraqi, U.S.-led and Iran-backed forces. Since then, Iran-aligned militias have regularly attacked U.S. military and diplomatic sites in Iraq, U.S. and many Iraqi officials say. Iran denies involvement in those attacks.

3/15/2022,"Iran launched a dozen ballistic missiles at the Iraqi city of Erbil late Saturday night in the vicinity of an unoccupied American consulate under construction, according to the Associated Press. In a statement released after the attack, the State Department said, “We condemn this outrageous attack and display of violence,” and confirmed that no U.S. personnel or facilities had been damaged. Lawk Ghafuri, a spokesman for the Kurdistan Regional Government, confirmed that 12 missiles had struck Erbil and claimed that they had been launched “from outside Iraq” and produced no casualties. Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi stopped short of attributing the attack but condemned the “aggression which targeted the dear city of Erbil and spread fear amongst its inhabitants.” He called it “an attack on the security of our people” and pledged to investigate it. Social media users in Erbil posted clips of apparent missile strikes in Erbil followed by large explosions. Kurdistan24, a local news channel with a studio near the scene of the strike, also broadcast footage of broken glass and damage at its offices near what the outlet claimed was a missile attack. Iranian-backed militia media outlets quickly claimed that the attack was carried out by Iran using Fateh-110 short range ballistic missiles. Social media users in Iran also posted videos of what appeared to be missiles streaking through the sky in towns and cities near Iran’s border with Iraq. Iran has not claimed responsibility for the attack, and semi official Iranian news outlets have instead amplified claims by Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. Fars News, which is close to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, tweeted out clips from Sabreen News, a popular Iranian-backed militia Telegram channel, which noted that security camera footage showed the missiles struck at 1:20 a.m., the same time that missiles from a U.S. drone killed Qods Force commander Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. The caption said that the timing was “not accidental at all.” U.S. Strike Kills Iran’s Most Important Military Commander Iran has twice before launched ballistic missiles at Iraqi targets. In September 2018, the IRGC’s Aerospace Force launched short range ballistic missiles at a facility belonging to the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, an armed separatist group that has called for an independent Kurdish homeland in Iran. In January 2020, Iran also attacked U.S. forces with a ballistic missile strike on Al-Asad airbase in retaliation for the killing of Soleimani. Read more at The Daily Beast. Got a tip?

3/15/2022,"DUBAI (Reuters) -Iranian state television said on Monday its security forces had thwarted a planned sabotage at the country's major Fordow nuclear site by a network it accused Israel of recruiting. It said the forces made arrests. The Israeli prime minister's office had no immediate comment on the report. The television said an Israeli officer first contacted a neighbour of an employee of the uranium enrichment plant and managed to recruit them both after paying them in cash and digital currency. Revolutionary Guards security agents were monitoring the network and were able to break it up before the sabotage could be carried out, arresting an unspecified number of people, the television said. The state news agency IRNA said a new agency called Revolutionary Guards Nuclear Command, which it said had been set up to oversee defence and security matters at nuclear installations, was involved in the operation to stop the planned sabotage. Iran has accused Israel of carrying out several attacks on facilities linked to its nuclear programme and of killing its nuclear scientists over the past years. Israel has neither denied nor confirmed the allegations. In April 2021, Tehran said an incident that disrupted the flow of power at Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility, in the desert in the central province of Isfahan, was caused by an act of “nuclear terrorism”.

3/15/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) -The Kremlin said on Monday that Russia could take full control of major Ukrainian cities and cautioned the West that it had sufficient military clout to fulfil all of its aims in Ukraine without any need for help from China. ""The defence ministry of the Russian Federation, while ensuring the maximum safety of the civilian population, does not exclude the possibility of taking major population centres under full control,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Peskov said that some of Ukraine's major cities were already surrounded by Russian forces. When asked by Reuters about remarks by U.S. officials who had said that Russia had asked China for military equipment, Peskov said: ""No."" ""Russia possesses its own independent potential to continue the operation. As we said, it is going according to plan and will be completed on time and in full.""

3/15/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin, ""frustrated"" by Ukraine's surprisingly stiff resistance, is increasingly escalating the scope of the war, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday. Earlier in the day, Russia fired waves of missiles at a Ukrainian military base in Lyiv, which is near the Polish border and far from the frontlines of the war. ""This does not come as a surprise to the American intelligence and national security community,"" Sullivan said on CNN's ""State of the Union.” ""What it shows is that Vladimir Putin is frustrated by the fact that his forces are not making the kind of progress that he thought that they would make against major cities including Kyiv, that he is expanding the number of targets, that he is lashing out, and that he is trying to cause damage in every part of the country,"" Sullivan continued. More than 30 Russian missiles killed at least 35 people and injured 134 in a strike at the Lviv military base, according to Ukrainian authorities. The base, a former NATO training center that had once hosted U.S. military instructors, had become a link for receiving Western military support to boost the country’s defense against the Russian invasion. The New York Times reported that ""up to 1,000 foreign fighters were training at the base,"" according to a Ukrainian official. (The U.S. said no American forces were there on Sunday.) Lviv, in Ukraine's west, has been a relatively peaceful outpost in the war, unlike the capital Kyiv and Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, in the east. It is a central hub for refugees fleeing west into Poland, as well as for supplies and weapons flowing east toward the heart of the conflict. The Sunday missile strike comes as Russia's invasion drags into its third week, failing to take key cities, despite facing a much smaller Ukrainian military, though boosted by shipments of Western military equipment. Russia recently said that those military convoys are ""legitimate targets"" for its forces. ""This is the third, now, military facility or airfield that the Russians have struck in Western Ukraine in just the last couple of days. So clearly, at least from an airstrike perspective, they're broadening their target sets,"" Defense Department spokesperson John Kirby said on ABC’s “This Week.” Sullivan also said Sunday that Russia would enter a broader war with NATO if it attacked any part of Poland, which is under 50 miles from Lviv and a member of the Western military alliance. ""The president has been clear repeatedly that the United States will work with our allies to defend every inch of NATO territory, and that means every inch,"" he said on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" ""And if there is a military attack on NATO territory, it would cause the invocation of Article Five, and we would bring the full force of the NATO alliance to bear in responding to it.""",World/Yahoo News,"Putin is 'lashing out,' U.S. adviser says of Western Ukraine missile strike",https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-lviv-missiles-jake-sullivan-153913925.html
