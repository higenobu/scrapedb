3/30/2022,"Former UFC fighter and ESPN analyst Chael Sonnen told police that he doesn’t remember the incident in a Las Vegas hotel last year that led to 11 battery charges, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Sonnen was charged with 11 counts of battery, including one felony battery by strangulation, last week after he allegedly punched or kicked five different men in Las Vegas on Dec. 18. Sonnen told police that both he and his wife had taken Ambien and “did not have memory of anything,” according to the Review-Journal. He also apparently asked police if everyone was OK multiple times. His wife, Brittany, told police she was asleep the entire time, per the report. Christopher and Julie Stellpflug filed a lawsuit against Sonnen on Friday claiming that he punched them repeatedly without any provocation at the Four Seasons hotel. Sonnen was allegedly choking Christopher while Julie “continued to yell and scream for help.” Sonnen then allegedly threw her against a light fixture and punched her in the face. A security guard, a hotel engineer and another man staying at the hotel all tried to intervene, but Sonnen punched or kicked each of them, per the report. Sonnen was initially charged with five counts of battery, but those charges were dismissed in January without prejudice. A new complaint was filed last week, and a hearing is set for Wednesday. Sonnen went 31-17 throughout his UFC and Bellator career. He hasn’t fought since 2019, and has served as an analyst in the sport since he retired.
