1/20/2022,"CRAIG, Colorado (AP) — In a quiet valley tucked away from Colorado’s bustling ski resorts, far from his hometown in northern Mexico, Trinidad Loya found a way to support his family’s American dream: Coal. He, his son and grandson — all named Trinidad Loya —worked for the coal plant in Craig, Colorado, with the eldest Loya starting more than 30 years ago. The plant currently employs 180 people, paying higher salaries and bringing far more job security than most other jobs in the area. But that’s all about to change. The coal plant is closing, along with the mine that feeds it and has nearly 115 more employees, and all the workers will lose their jobs over the next decade, according to Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Inc. which partially owns and operates the Craig Station. That will mean a tough transition for the Loyas and other workers who’ve made a life in Craig, a rural town with a population 9,000 that draws elk hunters from around the world to its scenic surroundings. “A power plant job, especially in a rural community like Craig -- those are what I call cradle to grave jobs,” said Richard Meisinger, business manager of the 111 chapter of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union which represents the bargaining unit at the Craig plant and nearly 4,200 members across Colorado and Wyoming. “People hire on there when they’re young anticipating that they are going to work at that power plant there their entire workable lifespan."" The same scenario is playing out in other small towns across the U.S. After decades of relying on coal for their workforce, tax base and way of life, the towns face uncertain futures as new state and national legislation forces the retirement of fossil fuels because of the worsening effects of human-caused climate change. Only a few towns have a viable plan to transition to cleaner energy, like one in Wyoming chosen for a Bill Gates-backed nuclear power plant. The impact spreads beyond the plants workers and is felt by the rest of the community, too. In Craig, much of the infrastructure of the county is supported by the coal plant workers, who make an average of $100,000 a year, compared with a $40,000 average salary across the county. Now, some workers will retire, while others, like the younger Loyas, must find a new way to support their families, and possibly leave Craig behind. On Monday, the middle Loya, started an apprenticeship position at another Tri-State owned facility across the state in Pueblo — some 300 miles away from Craig where he lives with his wife and two children, ages 7 and 3. When he's not working as a sub-station technician there, he plans on making the 5-hour drive to come home and see his family. He took a pay cut for the position. He's holding out hope a job opens at the Craig plant due to job movement within the plant. In the meantime, he'll stay with sister in Pueblo and hope for the best. ""It felt right to our family at the time,” Loya said. ___ Craig, population 9,000, sits in the heart of Colorado’s western front, only 40 miles from the popular Steamboat Springs ski area. Cows and lambs graze on farmlands. Creeks stream out of the nearby rivers. Deer traverse downtown Craig at night, munching on grass and curiously peeking around closed storefronts and offices. The rural escape is why many of those who grow up in Craig choose to stay. In winter months, the town, known as the elk hunting capital of the world, houses thousands of hunter groups donned in camouflage and bright orange who come to the area in search of game. Tens of thousands of hunters stay in the town’s hotels and frequent the local restaurants. According to a Colorado Parks and Wildlife report, the hunting industry brought $136 million to northwest Colorado in 2017. Moffatt County is made up of millions of acres of public lands, and its mineral deposits of high-volatility and low-sulfur coal brought the industry to town and sustained families for decades. The town has reinvented itself before. What was once a last stop on the Denver and Salt Lake Railway which allowed for nationwide agricultural exports like wool, soon the area became a money-maker for the oil industry and then a source of uranium. The oil fields and uranium mills left Craig by the 1960s as demands changed, but by the 1970s, coal was king in Colorado with companies buying up mines and others like Colorado-Ute Electric Association purchasing lands to build a power plant. This would eventually become the Craig Station. Now, the town is changing again. The owners of the Craig Station decided to close the 1,285-megawatt, three-unit plant over a ten-year period. Unit 1 and 2, owned by PacifiCorp, Platte River Power Authority, Salt River Project, Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association and Xcel Energy, are set to close in 2025 and 2028. Unit 3, solely owned by Tri-State, will retire by 2030. As the coal industry goes, so will nearly half of Moffatt County’s gross domestic product, Peterson said. It could affect services like healthcare, fire departments, infrastructure and upkeep for neighborhoods and roadways. According to Ray Beck, former Moffatt County Commissioner and Mayor of Craig, the county's biggest source of revenue is property tax. Moffatt County's 2020 assessed value was nearly $430 million with 62% coming from the top 10 taxpayers, all energy-related businesses. “We can't recover from that,"" Beck said. A scenario put together by the Moffatt County Assessor found that the economic situation would only get worse as the plant's three units shut down over time. According to the forecast, in 10 years when the entire powerplant shuts down, it would take 65 Super Walmarts and 93 Hampton Inns to replace the assessed value, Beck said. The loss of coal jobs in a community like Craig also will hurt small businesses whose customers are primarily coal workers and have disposable income, said Jennifer Holloway, executive director of the Craig Chamber of Commerce. That’s bad news for Gino's Pizzeria, the West Twin Cinema and Thunder Rolls Bowling Center. When discussions about the end of coal began, many in the town were in denial and some thought the decision would waver with the political winds. But that hasn’t happened, and people are now facing the reality of the loss of their way of life. “We’re taking people who generationally have been taught that they are the heroes in this story and suddenly they don’t differentiate between coal is bad and they are bad,” said Sasha Nelson, executive director of workforce education and economic development at Northwest Colorado Community College in Craig. “That is the message that we’re sending to some extent and that’s a hard one for proud people, for hard-working people, people who struggled, to be receiving. And there’s a lot of resistance and pushback.” ___ Tim Osborn, the power plant manager, estimates that they'll lose another 10 or so workers in 2022. “I forecasted all the way out to 2029 and we should have about 100 people here — if they’re all here in 2029 — that are age 55 and up,"" Osborn said. “Attrition is the driver, that's what I'm counting on throughout the process. It appears we can do that."" The attrition of workers retiring or moving on is already being felt. Many plant workers described picking up additional hours of overtime as well as doubling their work during shifts due to the lack of bodies available in certain plant positions. Many of the plant workers are finding their morale has gone down as the closure date inches closer. “It’s hard to get out of bed every day to go to work,” said Ron Geary, an electrician at the plant with a full gray beard and self-deprecating humor who treasures the work he does and the people he works with. One of his fears during this transition is the mental health of his colleagues who are losing a part of their identity and job security with retirement plan. “The coal miners, like my dad, they’re invested in that work because it’s a way for them to participate in our nation and be patriots. I mean you’re providing electricity for the rest of the country to develop and grow and become successful,” said Holloway, 49, who grew up in the area and stayed to work at the Chamber of Commerce. Many coal workers are frustrated and angry at the decisions made by Denver-based politicians that affect rural communities. They see other nations like China and India continuing to build new coal mines and think it’s hypocritical. Two-thirds of the world's coal is used for electric power, according to Carlos Fernandez Alvarez, a senior energy analyst for the International Energy Agency. For western, more developed nations which have diversified their power systems and become more efficient, energy demands are not increasing. But for developing counties like China and India, power demand is rising due to population growth and wider electrification efforts, so the transition is more difficult, he said. Power demand in India is expected to grow faster than anywhere in the world over the next two decades as the economy grows and ever more extreme heat increases demand for air conditioning that so much the rest of the world takes for granted. “It’s OK as long as it’s not on American soil, but they’re gonna shut us down because we produce a little too much (carbon dioxide) when they’re doing the same thing there?” Lytle said about other nations. One of the hardest parts of losing the plant is helping people find new jobs with employment benefits that provide a comparable lifestyle that coal families currently enjoy. For the Loyas, as for other coal families, the power plant afforded them a lifestyle they wouldn’t have had otherwise. Nelson is trying to figure out how to help coal workers find their next opportunity. Over the last year, she has created a catalog of courses with industry-recognized credentials and apprenticeship-like training for members of the community who need help figuring out what’s next. As she’s studied other transition communities, Nelson says worker transitions are typically split into three categories: one-third will have the means to retire between now and the final closure date, one-third will follow the industry or a similar field and one-third will retrain for a new career, open a business and some will become unemployed. In Spoon River College in Canton, Illinois, the community was given a four-month notice before two coal plants closed in 2019. Twenty percent of workers sought retraining with help from the community college. But 14% didn’t find new jobs and were unemployed in summer 2021. “That 14% of folks that become unemployed, that concerns me,” Nelson said. “Who are those folks and how do we help them and support them?” In Craig, some workers are trying to plan ahead. Christine Schnieder, 50, a water chemistry technical, has already sold her home and is living in an apartment. She’s also started training for a commercial driver’s license and is considering moving to Texas to be with her daughter. “There’s a chance I might still make it to 62 out there but I’m not wagering everything on that,” she said ___ Plenty of people are trying to make sure it’s not the end for Craig or the workers. Discussions are underway to decide what comes next for the plant facilities. Osborn, the plant manager, says the ideal situation would be to use the repurpose some of the plant’s equipment for renewable energy projects and keep people in the town employed. “There’s technology that doesn’t even exist right now that we would hopefully be able to study and implement and design and keep people employed here in town and still be a viable place of employment,” Osborn said. Sean Hvorka, a production superintendent at the Trapper Mine and recently elected member of the town’s city council, sees a future in mining because of renewables. “You look at windmills, solar panels, any of that -- you’ve gotta have mining for it,” he said. “You’ve gotta have the lithium that goes into the batteries for your Teslas and all that stuff. Mining is, it’s gonna be a critical field and we knew that we were gonna be part of the green energy movement.” “With the direction that the green energy is going you’re only gonna need more copper, you’re only going to need more, nickel, cobalt, lithium – all of those other things that have to be mined,” Hvorka said. Brent Wanner, head of power sector modelling and analysis for the World Energy Outlook, an annual publication by the IEA, said the power sector is in a good position to lead the change in large-scale clean energy transitions. The industry leads the way in emissions declines and is already transitioning away from coal to new options. The older Loya said it’s disappointing to see the end of the plant, which holds his family’s American legacy, but he prefers not to see it as a doomsday scenario. “There’s always a light at the end of the tunnel,” he said. “Maybe this will become a hydrogen plant.” ____ To read AP’s coverage of global climate change issues: https://apnews.com/hub/climate ____ Nieberg is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

1/20/2022,"Lauren Smith-Fields was found unresponsive in her apartment after a Bumble date in December. Her family said they have been left with many unanswered questions, including the cause of death. TikTokers are criticizing the lack of coverage, using the hashtag #justiceforlaurensmithfields. Lauren Smith-Fields was reported as unresponsive in her apartment in Bridgeport, Connecticut after a date on December 12, 2021. The 23-year-old was found dead by an unidentified man, her family told Winchester News 12, describing the man as an ""older white man"" whom Smith-Fields met on the dating app Bumble. Smith-Fields' family told the outlet they had been left with several unanswered questions about her death. Now, TikTokers are criticizing the lack of media coverage and public attention on Smith-Fields, a Black woman, and comparing it to the attention Gabby Petito, a white woman, received when she went missing in September. Many creators have referenced a phenomenon sociologists call ""missing white woman syndrome,"" where cases of missing white women and girls are far more likely to make the news than women of color. Those concerns are compounded by Smith-Fields' relatives saying that they haven't been receiving enough information from police. Smith-Fields' father told Winchester News 12 that he had paid for a second autopsy himself, because he was ""uncomfortable"" with the way the case was being handled. A month later, on January 13, Smith-Fields' mother, Shantell Fields, told Yahoo News that the police department told them to stop calling. ""We haven't had any answers since the day that we found out that she passed away,"" she said. The Bridgeport Police Department said in a statement at the end of December that it ""takes these concerns very seriously,"" according to Winchester News 12. There appear to be no public statements about Smith-Fields on the department's Facebook or Twitter pages posted since. The police chief did not respond to Insider's request for comment. TikToks under the hashtag #justiceforlaurensmithfields have received 4.2 million views. True crime and travel TikToker Haley Toumaian, who has 751,000 followers, said Smith-Fields deserves for her name to be ""everywhere."" ""She died under mysterious circumstances,"" she said in a video posted at the beginning of January, which received 1 million views. TikToker Fiona Meehan said in a video at the end of December, which was viewed 12 million times, that the lack of coverage was ""enraging."" Kate Dawson Winkler, a senior lecturer in broadcast journalism at UT-Austin who specializes in true crime, told Insider there is just ""not that same kind of attention"" for people of color, indigenous people, and transgender people when they go missing. ""Where is the social media outcry and the overwhelming amount of information when it is somebody that falls into that category?"" Winkler said. ""You just don't see it."" Criminologist Zach Sommers wrote in an analysis of news reports published in Northwestern University School of Law's Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology in 2016, that missing white woman syndrome is likely ""a real, empirical phenomenon."" ""The race and gender disparities are evident across multiple sources and using multiple methods of analysis,"" he wrote. ""The disparities are also quite large and, for the most part, consistent with the differences predicted by MWWS."" Meehan told Insider that she decided to share Smith-Fields' story on her TikTok because the family's interview had upset her so much. ""I feel like if people are loud about it, maybe something will happen,"" Meehan said. ""Especially right now, while it's fresh — put pressure on the police, because they aren't saying anything about it and it's very upsetting."" The silence surrounding Smith-Fields in comparison to the reaction over the Petito case is triggering, Meehan told Insider. ""We aren't seen as, as fragile or as precious,"" she said. ""This just is another example of how Black people are treated differently in this country than white people."" Anthony Hyland, a speaker and independent journalist who has 1.5 million followers on TikTok told Insider he posted about Smith-Fields because of his passion for the ""Protect Black Women"" movement. It started on Twitter and Instagram started in March of 2020 after Breonna Taylor was shot and killed by Louisville police, and called for more protection of Black women and awareness of the violence they face. It is unclear who started the hashtag, but tweets from Halle Berry and Megan Thee Stallion raised further awareness, and people continue to share the stories of missing and killed Black women and girls. ""It's a literal mantra that should be taken with the utmost seriousness,"" Hyland told Insider. Meehan said she believes people are beginning to understand how people of color are treated differently thanks to social media campaigning, and the platform is an effective way of spreading awareness. So she feels things are heading in the right direction. ""But we've still got a long way to go in fixing the problem,"" she said. ""When we say 'Black lives matter,' this is what we mean."" There is currently a GoFundMe set up by Smith-Fields' family, which is raising money to help ""bring the answers we are looking for to light."" It has raised about $25,000 so far.

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below."" In September 2018, the pain in my ribs and back erupted almost overnight. I ignored it at first, sure that I had done too many abdominal exercises at the gym. When the pain persisted for a few weeks, I went to my doctor. She was a bit concerned, but all my blood and urine tests came back normal. Two months later, the pain intensified and started waking me at night. I made an appointment with a physical therapist. Within 10 minutes of examining me, a shadow came over the therapist’s face. “I don’t want to alarm you, but this pain is not muscular-skeletal,” she told me. “You need to get a CT scan. Today.” Later that day—the Wednesday before Thanksgiving—my husband Greg and I sat in our local hospital’s emergency department, waiting for scan results. When the ED doctor returned to my room, her tone was serious. “We found something we totally didn’t expect,” she said. “There is a suspicious mass on your pancreas that looks like cancer. I’m so, so sorry.” A chill shivered down my entire body. From my experience as a health writer, I already knew that pancreatic was one of the deadliest types of cancer I could have. Somehow, my brain immediately switched to medical reporter mode and I asked questions. I must have been in shock, but I managed to take extra-meticulous notes, almost as if my neatly written words let me take some control over the information I had just heard. When I look back at those pages now, I barely recognize my own handwriting. Pancreatic cancer is the third deadliest cancer in the United States. Around three in four patients die within a year of being diagnosed. And what makes this cancer especially sneaky is that its early symptoms are so vague: Abdominal or back aches. A little stomach discomfort. Some bloating. Stuff you might feel if you ate too much at dinner. Nothing you would take seriously at all. In addition, most common blood tests don’t detect pancreatic cancer. By the time the cancer is discovered, the tumor has usually grown quite large. It may also have spread outside the pancreas, to the liver, lungs or, more rarely, abdominal fluid that may have collected due to the cancer. This cancer is quick moving and deadly. In my case, the pancreatic tumor was about the size of a golf ball, but had not yet spread. However, it was wrapped so tightly around several aortic and liver-related blood vessels that they were almost completely blocked. Removing the tumor surgically was next to impossible. My only option was aggressive chemotherapy. It might extend my life, but it was not expected to cure me. But I understood none of this on the night before Thanksgiving. All I knew was that my life was forever changed. I felt that our daughters, ages 17 and 21, were still too young to lose their mother without it leaving a permanent scar. My husband and I had been married 29 years and were as close as we’d ever been. Now our shared future was dissolving in front of my eyes. At 3 a.m. on Thanksgiving morning, I got up, unable to sleep. I padded quietly downstairs to our dining room and set the table for dinner with our extended family. I folded napkins and laid out silverware and plates. I set out bowls for mashed potatoes, stuffing, gravy and vegetables and tucked tiny yellow sticky notes into each dish so I’d remember which was which. Then I gave up and dissolved onto the cool, hardwood floor. I lay down flat, my face touching the wood, and began to pray. “Please, God, give me time. Give me time to be with my daughters and Greg. Please give me more time.” Until you actually experience it, you cannot possibly know how you’ll handle the news that you might be dying. My first reaction was, quite strangely, relief. I can let up now. I don’t have to work so hard at this thing called life, because it’s almost over, I thought to myself. I had not realized until my diagnosis how utterly exhausted I was. I’d spent the past decade dealing with the stress of caring for both of my aging parents (now deceased), my husband’s recent job loss, maintaining my own freelance writing business and worrying over various issues related to my daughters’ health and education. Looking back, I believe that this cycle of chronic stress could have encouraged the cancer to take hold. I had none of the common risk factors that could explain this deadly diagnosis. But within days of getting this frightening news, a spark of new energy ignited inside me. I wasn’t ready to die. I was determined to use every research skill I had learned throughout my writing career to prolong my own life. That was more than three years ago. The doctors initially told me I had about 18 months to live. Since my diagnosis, I’ve learned more than I ever expected about cancer treatment and how critical it is for us patients—not just our doctors—to take active roles in our own healing journeys. The most effective chemotherapy regimen for pancreatic cancer is a rigorous one called FOLFIRINOX that lasts for three days at a stretch. It required me to sit in a cancer center infusion room for eight hours, then go home with a chemo pump attached to a vein in my chest for 46 more hours. I repeated that cycle every two weeks. I experienced all the classic chemo symptoms: fatigue, unrelenting nausea and diarrhea, loss of appetite and a metallic taste in my mouth that made even plain water taste horrible. One of the chemo drugs caused my hands and feet to go numb, a condition called neuropathy. I couldn’t close clasps on necklaces or type accurately on my laptop. The numbness in my feet made me constantly trip when I walked. When I wasn’t leaning over the toilet retching, I was researching pancreatic cancer to see if I could improve my odds of living. My research led me to make a bunch of lifestyle changes: I adopted a ketogenic diet, which some health researchers believe may help stop certain types of cancer from growing. I completely stopped eating sugar, too, to give my body every health benefit I could. I read research by Valter Longo, Ph.D., of the University of Southern California, who discovered that fasting might make chemotherapy more effective and help reduce chemo-related side effects such as nausea and mouth sores. For 48 hours before and 24 hours during each of my biweekly chemo sessions, I stopped eating and drank only water and herbal tea. I lost 30 pounds I didn’t need, then learned how to stabilize my weight during my non-fasting days. Maintaining hope also became a key part of my treatment. I asked my oncologist to stop talking to me about survival statistics or time frames unless I specifically asked. I also began searching online for pancreatic cancer survivors. I found Marla through a work colleague and Jane through a hospital website. I emailed and talked to both women by phone about what they were doing to stay alive. I also joined a number of patient-led cancer Facebook groups. In addition, I meditated, prayed, underwent Reiki healing sessions, and used guided visualization to imagine my tumor being dissolved by a healing white light. Friends and family rallied around me, and set up a GoFundMe account to help Greg and me with our ongoing expenses. After several months, new scans showed that the chemo and my extra efforts were working! Not only had the cancer stopped growing, the tumor was actually shrinking. My pain also disappeared. It looked like tumor-removal surgery might be a possibility. I set my sights on consulting one of the country’s top pancreatic surgeons at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. My health insurer initially refused to allow me to go outside my home state of Oregon for care. It took three months of vigorous appeals, and the help of a friend who worked in the insurance field, but my insurance company eventually relented. I visited the Mayo Clinic surgeon in May 2019 and he gave me a tentative OK for lifesaving pancreatic surgery. I went home to Oregon with a few more health milestones to complete, and we tentatively scheduled the pancreatic surgery for that September. Greg and I felt like we had just won the health care lottery! Unfortunately, our celebration was short-lived. Just a month later, I ended up in the hospital. It appeared that I had a life-threatening reaction to one of my chemotherapy medications and it almost stopped my heart. Two days later, coincidentally, I had emergency gallbladder surgery. During that operation, my surgeon noticed several tiny, cancerous lesions on my liver. With that, I was considered a stage 4, or “terminal” cancer patient. Because of those tiny liver tumors, the Mayo Clinic cancelled my pancreatic surgery. My family and I were heartbroken. For several weeks after getting this news, I could barely function. It seemed that my only hope for a cure had been ripped out from under me. Then, by pure coincidence, I ran across an intriguing book: How to Starve Cancer…and Then Kill it With Ferroptosis by Jane McLelland. This book opened the door to an entirely new world of unconventional cancer treatment and to patients who were working with open-minded doctors to direct their own care. How to Starve Cancer isn’t a book about food or lack thereof. It’s actually part memoir, part geeky medical research by a London-based woman who survived stage 4 cervical cancer. McLelland’s self-studied treatment includes using a cocktail of fairly well known, nontoxic, generic drugs and natural supplements to block cancer from growing. The FDA-approved drugs McLelland describes were originally developed for use with other medical conditions, including diabetes, high cholesterol, and ulcers. In recent years, though, researchers have found that these drugs may have anti-cancer properties. Using these drugs to treat cancer instead of their originally targeted health conditions is considered “off label” use. As I delved into this new world, I learned that many other medical professionals and researchers were also enthusiastic about the possibility of using so-called off-label or repurposed drugs to fight cancer. Patients and medical professionals have developed entire Facebook groups devoted to helping each other understand how to use and access these prescriptions. I felt a wave of newfound hope: Could patients like me actually beat back a deadly disease like pancreatic cancer with a handful of inexpensive, often-forgotten prescription drugs? I wasn’t sure, but I knew one thing for certain: I had nothing to lose by trying. There was no cure waiting in the wings for me. I printed off medical research papers about a few of the drugs and their potentially cancer-fighting properties and excitedly took them to my next chemotherapy appointment. When I showed them to my oncologist, Rui Li., M.D., Ph.D., her reaction was swift and firm: She absolutely refused to prescribe any of the drugs and scared me into thinking I might seriously harm myself by trying them. Now, I’m not normally a rule breaker. I was a teacher-pleasing student in school. I wait for green lights at crosswalks. And I have no delusions that I, a layperson, understand cancer better than someone who has graduated from medical school. But at this point, I had a terminal cancer diagnosis. My husband Greg and I both agreed that we didn’t want to look back later with regret and say, “If only we had tried those off-label drugs.” I consulted two other doctors, who both agreed that the off-label drugs I was considered were, indeed, safe. That was all the reassurance I needed. I felt really uncomfortable doing so, but I decided not to tell my oncologist what I had decided. Instead, I consulted Dave Allderdice, N.D., FABNO, a naturopath in my hometown who specializes in working with cancer patients. With Allderdice’s help and Greg’s full support, I slowly added off-label drugs to my many daily supplements. The naturopath prescribed one drug at a time. I’d take it for two weeks, then he’d review my blood work and check on side effects. As each drug proved safe, we added another, and then another. I bought an acrylic jewelry sorter to store the dozens of pills I took three times a day. Some of my fellow patients accessed these same off-label drugs a different way: through a group of experts that have organized themselves through a group called the Care Oncology Clinic (COC). Based in both the United Kingdom and the United States, these doctors’ primary goal is meeting virtually with cancer patients who want to try this experimental approach. The only reasons I didn’t use the COC were 1) I had already found a local provider who could help me, and 2) cost. The prescription drugs cost the same no matter who prescribes them, but COC doctors charge consulting fees. Still, if this had been my only way to access the drugs, I absolutely would have consulted a COC practitioner. Every month when I picked up the off-label drugs at our local pharmacy, I worried that my oncologist, Dr. Li, would somehow get an alert about my new prescriptions. It never happened. And when the medical assistant asked me at my biweekly chemotherapy appointments about any new prescriptions I was taking, I bit my tongue hard (figuratively) and said, “Nope. Nothing new.” Within a couple of months, my naturopath Allderdice and I could both see that my body was tolerating the prescriptions well. My biweekly blood tests looked good. My tumor continued to shrink. Even my oncologist, Dr. Li, was surprised and pleased about my progress. Every time we got a new, more positive scan, she beamed. “You are doing so well! Your progress is really unusual for pancreatic cancer,” she said. A handful of fellow pancreatic patients I met on Facebook were also experimenting with off-label prescriptions and supplements. We began sharing notes on side effects, sympathetic doctors and new research. Other patients shared protocols that included dietary changes, cannabidiol, high-dose Vitamin C infusions, and complementary therapies like spending time in hyperbaric oxygen chambers and infrared saunas. My online pancreatic pals were, and still are, intense researchers, unfailing optimists, and strong advocates for their own health. I felt like I had truly found my tribe. None of us wanted to belong to the cancer club. But if we had to undergo this challenge, we agreed that we were going to do it on our own terms—and share our findings with each other along the way. After about a year of trying the off-label drugs for cancer, I felt the need to be honest with my oncologist. It was a risky move. Several other patients I knew from my Facebook groups had already been “fired” by their oncologists for trying alternative treatments without their doctor’s knowledge. At a regular chemotherapy appointment, I finally blurted out to Dr. Li: “You know those off-label drugs we talked about, the ones you weren’t excited about?” I asked her. “Well, I’ve actually been taking them for a while. I feel badly not telling you sooner, but this was something I had to do.” My oncologist’s face immediately registered displeasure. “What? Which drugs? What dosages? Who prescribed these drugs?” she demanded to know. I answered all of her questions. I could see from her queries that her main concern was for my safety. My doctor pulled up my blood-test history on her computer, and I showed her how my key tests had remained steady or even improved while I embarked on the experimental drug regimen. After our discussion, Dr. Li seemed reassured that I wasn’t a crackpot. However, for the next several weeks, I worried about getting a call or letter that she was refusing to treat me as a patient because I had taken my health into my own hands. That doesn’t mean she fully supports my regimen. “I don’t think the many supplements are the key contributing factors for Teri’s current health,” she says. “It is impossible to identify which supplements really helped.” She adds, “From a scientific view, I do not encourage patients to [take non-prescribed supplements or medicine] without participating in clinical trials.” But here’s what I kept reminding myself: Stage 4 cancer typically is a death sentence. There is no such thing as stage 5. If a doctor has already told a patient that they cannot cure them, shouldn’t the patient be free to experiment with other, untested treatment options? Ideally, of course, patients would wait for drug or other treatment regimens to go through exhaustive clinical trials and become part of the standard treatment for their cancer. But pancreatic patients like me—and many others with fast-moving cancers—simply don’t have the luxury of waiting a decade or more for clinical trials to finish and report their results. Besides that, there is the possibility that unusual approaches like using off-label drugs, cannabis or natural supplements may never get the public attention they might rightfully deserve. Pharmaceutical companies can’t patent or repackage these treatment options and sell them at a nice profit. And if oncologists like mine are suspicious of using anything besides chemotherapy or radiation, how will patients ever learn about other options? Two weeks after I revealed my drug experiment to my oncologist, we met again. I asked her point-blank: “Are you going to fire me as a patient?” Dr. Li laughed and shook her head. To her great credit, she said she would never get insulted if I got better using drugs someone else had prescribed. “I still don’t completely agree with the idea of these drugs, but I cannot argue with how well you’re doing,” she said. “And I do believe that stage 4 cancer patients should have a right to experiment with their own care.” I’ve now been taking my cocktail of off-label drugs and natural supplements for more than two years. I’ve long since passed my original “expiration date” of 18 months. If I’m fortunate enough to live for two more years—to the five-year survival mark—I’ll be one of only 10 percent of pancreatic cancer patients to survive that long. I wish I could say that I’m miraculously cured, but I’m not. A tiny remnant of the cancer remains in my pancreas, and rogue tumor cells are likely still circulating throughout my bloodstream. But I have gotten precious extra time on this earth with my friends and family—which is what I prayed for during the predawn hours of Thanksgiving in 2018. I’ve also learned for myself — and have shared with anyone who will listen — how important it is for patients to research and work alongside their doctors to get the best possible care. I no longer believe that being a polite, rule-following patient is the way to live. That’s especially true if you have a health condition that takes the lives of significantly more people than it spares. Years ago, I watched a movie called “The Edge.” Anthony Hopkins stars as a wealthy but sheltered businessperson who must make his way out of the Alaskan wilderness (with costar Alec Baldwin) after a freak plane crash. Hopkins’ character has a single book about survival skills. But that volume encourages the billionaire to repeat a simple phrase whenever he and Baldwin’s character verged on losing hope: “What one [person] can do, another can do.” I have repeated that same phrase to myself throughout my pancreatic cancer journey. If just one patient can survive this cancer or live a longer-than-expected life—and I know several who have—another person can do the same. Maybe that person can be me. Unexplained middle back or stomach pain: A pancreatic tumor can press on the spine, nerves, or nearby organs. Stomach bloating: You might be gassier than usual or feel that your stomach is swollen. These symptoms are caused by trouble digesting your food. Unintended weight loss: Pancreatic cancer can impact the way your body digests and absorbs nutrients from your food. You may lose weight without trying. Yellow skin or eyes: Pancreatic tumors can block the bile that moves from your gallbladder to your small intestine. When this happens, yellowish bilirubin from your bile builds up and is visible in your eyes or skin. You may also have itchy skin, pale-colored stools or dark urine. Poop problems: You could suddenly develop ongoing diarrhea, constipation or both. Late-onset diabetes: People who become diabetic when they’re 50 or older may be experiencing an early symptom of pancreatic cancer. Someone who already has diabetes and suddenly has trouble controlling their blood sugar should also be evaluated for pancreatic cancer. Family history of pancreatic cancer History of pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) Obesity: Being very overweight increases your risk of this cancer by 20% Smoking: About 25% of pancreatic cancers are thought to be caused by cigarette smoking. Race: Ashkenazi Jews and African Americans have a higher incidence of pancreatic cancer Age & gender: Almost all pancreatic cancer patients are over 45, and two-thirds are at least 65. It also impacts men slightly more than women. These organizations offer support and information: Pancreatic Cancer Action Network: This nonprofit organization offers patient support, helps identify hospitals and specialists that treat pancreatic cancer, connects patients to possible clinical trials and more. Project Purple: Pancreatic patients who are facing financial hardships because of their inability to work or medical treatment costs can apply for financial aid once a year. Cancer Commons: This network of patients, physicians, and scientists helps patients with all varieties of metastatic cancer (at no charge) explore their best possible treatment plans and clinical trials. Foundations: The National Pancreas Foundation, Lustgarten Foundation, and Hirshberg Foundation for Pancreas Cancer Research help fund pancreatic cancer research and offer patient education and support. The Hirshberg Foundation offers patient financial aid. Lazarex Cancer Foundation: Lazarex helps advanced cancer patients find FDA-approved clinical trials. It also offers financial support to patients who travel away from home to participate in clinical trials. These Facebook groups can help you connect with others.

1/20/2022,"Five children were on a paddleboarding trip when they disappeared on a frigid night in North Carolina, officials said. Temperatures were in the 30s when crews searched for the kids, who were found safe three hours later on a bank along Belews Lake, according to Stokes County Fire Marshal Scott Aaron. Officials said six kids were at the lake when their dad went to help one of them warm up in the car on Monday, Jan. 17. That’s when he reportedly lost sight of the other children. “I couldn’t stand the thought of knowing that maybe there’s kids out there clinging to a paddleboard,” Eric Tumas, who used a searchlight to help spot the kids, told WGHP. Crews responded to Pine Hall boat landing, roughly 20 miles northeast of Winston-Salem. While there, snow and ice from past wintry weather got in the way of launching boats, Aaron told McClatchy News in a phone interview. Rescuers received a report about the disappearance at 6:30 p.m. and found the children at about 9:45 p.m. Officials said the kids likely ended up in a cove after wind pushed them there. The night of the rescue, officials said it was about 35 degrees. The kids weren’t injured but went to Wake Forest Baptist hospital after being exposed to the cold temperatures, according to Aaron. “This could have been a bad outcome due to the weather conditions and being out on the water,” Brandon Gentry, Stokes County emergency management director, told WFMY. The Stokes-Rockingham Volunteer Fire & Rescue Department, the lead agency in the rescue, didn’t immediately respond to McClatchy News’ request for information on Jan. 18. The agency in a Facebook post said it received help from Stokes County officials as well as the N.C. Department of Transportation, N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission, Rockingham County Sheriff’s Office and other entities.
