2/5/2022,"Rudy Giuliani said if Trump had imposed martial law to stay in power, they would end up behind bars, NYT reported. If Trump had taken that step, Giuliani reportedly told an associate, ""we would all end up in prison."" Trump did not impose martial law but envisioned multiple scenarios in which federal agencies seized voting machines. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani said that if then President Donald Trump had imposed martial law in an effort to overturn the 2020 election results, the former president and many of his aides would have wound up behind bars. That's according to Patrick Byrne, the former head of Overstock, who told The New York Times that Giuliani recently explained to him that he advised Trump against imposing martial law because ""we would all end up in prison."" The Times has previously reported on Giuliani's opposition to instituting martial law. Despite his own endorsement of outlandish conspiracy theories about voter and election fraud, he became alarmed when former national security advisor Michael Flynn and former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell suggested imposing martial law. According to the paper, Flynn, Powell, and Byrne went to the Oval Office on December 18, 2020 and laid out a plan that involved deploying the military to seize voting machines and ballots in key battleground states. Giuliani waited until Flynn and Powell had left the Oval Office and told Trump that their plan would get him impeached, the report said. Giuliani's lawyer did not immediately respond to The Times' request for comment. Trump ultimately heeded Giuliani's advice and did not impose martial law. But he did consider scenarios in which federal agencies like the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense would seize voting machines, the report said. In one case, Trump met with then attorney general William Barr in the Oval Office after the election and asked him to use the Justice Department to take voting machines. But Barr immediately rejected the request. In December, roughly six weeks after Election Day 2020, Trump told Giuliani to ask if the DHS had the legal power to seize voting machines in key battleground states, The Times previously reported. But the department's acting deputy secretary said he didn't have that authority. The House select committee investigating the Capitol riot also recently obtained a draft executive order that directed the Secretary of Defense to ""seize"" voting machines. It's unclear who wrote the draft, and The Times reported that Trump had rejected a request by his outside advisors to use the Pentagon to take control of the machines. Trump ultimately did get impeached a second time after the House of Representatives accused him of inciting the failed insurrection on January 6, 2021. Flynn, meanwhile, repeatedly called on Trump to use the military to stay in power. The same week that he and Powell went to the Oval Office to urge Trump to lay out their proposal, Flynn appeared on the far-right outlet Newsmax and said Trump should deploy the military and hold another election. But those remarks aren't based in reality. Despite Republican claims of fraud and election rigging, nonpartisan officials and election experts confirmed that the 2020 election was the safest and most secure in US history. The president does not have the power to unilaterally cancel, delay, postpone, or change the date of an election, even if he declares martial law. As Business Insider previously reported, that power lies with Congress. Declaring martial law also does not suspend the Constitution, and the military has no role in administering elections. Even if it did, it would not be able to run new elections because the right to vote is not specified in the Constitution or by a federal statute.

2/5/2022,"John Cena has become a prominent Hollywood actor after a long WWE career. Cena says he adopted yoga so he could be better at stunts, by losing weight and getting more flexible. ""I immediately lost 20 pounds, which was very difficult for me. I even fell into a weird depression,"" he said. John Cena's journey from a professional wrestling star to a Hollywood actor involved an emotional reflection on his body and fitness routine, he told GQ. Cena, once the most popular wrestler in the WWE, has followed a career path, similar to Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, from scripted sports into the mainstreams of Hollywood films, and now stars in his own HBO Max series ""The Peacemaker,"" which became one of the most-watched shows in the world in January. But the 44-year-old actor said one of the most important new workouts on his journey into his new industry was yoga which he took up while filming ""Snafu,"" with Jackie Chan, which is slated to release in 2022 in China. The 6-foot-1 Cena weighed 251 lbs during his WWE career, but said he lost 20 lbs when he switched his routine to prioritize yoga. ""They could care less about how strong I was. They just wanted me to kick over my head, which was impossible,"" Cena told GQ. ""I went over there to train with him for about three months and they stretched me like taffy. I immediately lost 20 pounds, which was very difficult for me. I even fell into a weird depression because it was like 'I'm losing everything that I worked on for 30 years!'"" Yoga is an effective workout for weight loss. But losing lots of weight quickly can affect a person's mental health and can be linked to depression. A study at University College London examined 1,979 people in the UK with a BMI classified as overweight or obese. They found that people who lost more than 5% of their bodyweight were 52% more likely to report depression than those who shed pounds but stayed closer to their original weight, via Time Magazine. Cena said doing yoga regularly helped him physically, and over time strengthened the connection between his body and mind — one of the reported benefits of yoga. ""It actually keeps me present and in tune with my body. If I had anything in my mental backpack on the way into the gym, it's gone by the time I leave,"" Cena told GQ. ""I begin to walk taller, begin to have less pain, I was more flexible, and that experience changed my life in many ways, and it taught me the value of making sure your body moves OK."" Yoga is a popular workout among pro athletes in the NFL and NBA, used by stars like LeBron James and Aaron Rodgers, for its reported benefits of improving flexibility, and mobility, and being injury prevention practice. When Cena performed in the WWE, he said his workout routine mostly consisted of heavy weightlifting to build large muscles. But yoga helped Cena take an approach aimed at improving mobility and flexibility. ""In yoga, the concept is that you need to be present because we're going to stretch you farther than you think you can go,"" he told GQ. Cena told Metro that he does most of his own stunts for ""The Peacemaker,"" and yoga could be a big reason why. But the actor said it's also just going to improve his life overall. ""My training has switched a lot because I'm old. I'm going to be 45 this year,"" Cena told GQ. ""Now, I'm trying to be able to lift weights when I'm 80, so I need to take a little bit more care of myself for the long term.""

2/5/2022,"By Nancy Lapid (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review. Alzheimer's-like changes seen in COVID-19 patients' brains People who die of severe COVID-19 have brain abnormalities that resemble changes seen in Alzheimer's disease - accumulation of a protein called tau inside brain cells, and abnormal amounts of the protein beta-amyloid that accumulates into amyloid plaques - small studies have found. At Columbia University, Dr. Andrew Marks and colleagues studied the brains of 10 COVID-19 patients and found defects in proteins called ryanodine receptors that control the passage of calcium into cells. In Alzheimer's disease, defective ryanodine receptors are linked to accumulation of tau into so-called neurofibrillary tangles. These tangles were present in high levels in the COVID-19 patients' brains, the Columbia team reported on Thursday in Alzheimer's & Dementia. Other research teams have looked for - and found - abnormal amyloid levels in brains of COVID-19 patients, according to reports posted online ahead of peer review on bioRxiv and on The Lancet's preprint server. In all the studies, patients had experienced the most severe forms of COVID-19. If similar changes are occurring in the brains of patients with milder illness, that might help explain the ""brain fog"" associated with long COVID, Marks said. Patients with severe COVID-19 might be at higher risk for dementia later in life, but it is too soon to know, he added. His advice: Get a booster vaccine and avoid the virus. ""If you get COVID-19, you probably won't die, but we still don't know a lot about the long-term effects."" Seniors can get flu shot, mRNA COVID-19 booster together Seniors can safely get the high-dose flu vaccine and an mRNA COVID-19 booster dose at the same time, a new study confirms. The study's 306 participants, all older than 65, were randomly assigned either to receive Sanofi's Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent influenza vaccine and a third shot of Moderna's mRNA vaccine at the same time, or either of the vaccines alone. Blood samples obtained before and 21 days after vaccination showed that giving the two vaccines together did not affect the resulting immune response, with similar antibody levels generated in participants in each of the three groups, according to a report published on Tuesday in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. A spokesperson for Sanofi said combined administration of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines ""did not raise any safety concerns and the study team is continuing to follow study participants through 6 months after vaccination."" Fluid in some rapid COVID tests could be deadly for kids In some COVID-19 rapid test kits, the small bottle of ""reagent"" fluid contains sodium azide, a powerful poison that is particularly dangerous for small children, experts warn. In adults, small amounts can quickly cause dangerously low blood pressure, dizziness, fainting, or even heart attacks or strokes, said Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor, Co-Medical Director of the National Capital Poison Center in Washington, D.C. Higher doses can be fatal, she and her colleagues wrote in The American Journal of Emergency Medicine. Sodium azide levels in COVID-19 rapid test kits are not always high enough to cause low blood pressure in adults, and the iHealth kits being sent out by the U.S. government do not contain any sodium azide at all, Johnson-Arbor said. ""However... since children are typically much smaller than adults, they are at a higher risk of experiencing poisonous effects after swallowing any amount,"" she said. Poison control hotlines have been getting reports of accidental exposures to the reagent fluid. ""Some people have swallowed the solution, some have spilled it onto their skin, and others have put it in their eyes,"" mistaking the bottle for eye drops, Johnson-Arbor said. ""If you or a loved one swallows the reagent fluid or gets the fluid in their eyes or on the skin, contact Poison Control right away.""

2/5/2022,"A man paid his brother with cash and a motorcycle to shoot his ex-wife — a teacher in Alabama — in a murder-for-hire plot, according to recently unsealed federal court documents. Jason Starr was arrested Dec. 7 in Coffee County, Alabama. But his brother, 53-year-old Darin Starr, is still on the run. Darin Starr, who was born in North Carolina but has ties to Texas, Arizona, and Connecticut, is wanted for the murder of his former sister-in-law, 38-year-old Sara Starr, on Nov. 27, 2017. A federal arrest warrant was issued in the Middle District of Alabama on Dec. 2 after Darin Starr was charged alongside his brother with the use of interstate commerce in the commission of a murder-for-hire. The indictment, filed Dec. 1, wasn’t unsealed until Jan. 24, court documents show. Investigators have released few details about the alleged plot, but the grand jury said Jason Starr gave his brother a 2016 Triumph motorcycle and an undisclosed amount of money to kill his ex-wife. Jason Starr’s defense attorney could not be immediately reached for comment by McClatchy News. Sara Starr was a mother to two sets of twins and a fourth-grade teacher at Harrand Creek Elementary School, The Birmingham News reported. Her classroom “always smelled like coffee,” a former student said, and she loved to tell jokes. “Sara Elizabeth’s children were the loves of her life,” her obituary read. “She loved them more than anything else. She loved her parents, grandparents, siblings and other family members. Teaching was always her dream. She excelled in the classroom and was loved by her students.” Sara Starr’s coworkers got worried on the morning of Nov. 27, 2017, when she didn’t show up to school and went to her house in Enterprise, Alabama, where they found her body in the driveway, WTVY reported. Investigators determined she died “sometime after 6:30 a.m.,” The Southeast Sun reported. Sheriff’s deputies arrived about two hours later at 8:30 a.m. According to an autopsy report included in federal court filings, she died from a gunshot wound to the head. Law enforcement began investigating her death as a homicide, and Jason Starr, of Daleville, Alabama, was an early suspect. But he had an alibi — he was eating breakfast at a cafe when his ex-wife was killed, WTVY reported. “We knew — we had strong, decent evidence early on,” Tom Anderson, district attorney in the 12th Judicial Circuit, said during a Dec. 7 news conference live streamed by WTVY after Jason Starr was arrested. “But knowing somebody did something and being able to prove somebody did something are two totally different things.” Coffee County Sheriff Dave Sutton wouldn’t comment on a motive but confirmed Jason Starr had been served with a document a few days before Sara Starr’s death that would have required him to pay $2,500 a month to his former wife and children. The sheriff said Jason Starr was taken into custody without incident. Anderson told reporters one of the deputies who was there described him as “pretty smug” during the arrest. “I think he’s always thought that he’s above everything,” Anderson said at the news conference. Jason Starr pleaded not guilty during an arraignment hearing on Jan. 26, court documents show. A jury trial has been set for June 27. He is also facing charges of child sex abuse in a separate state court case, The Southeast Sun reported. The FBI is offering a $10,000 reward for any information that leads to the arrest of Darin Starr. Anyone with information is asked to contact their local FBI office or the nearest American Embassy or Consulate.
