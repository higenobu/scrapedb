4/1/2022,"In the early 2010s, mindfulness was the wellness trend to complement the times. It had a self-optimising, corporate vibe that promised if you did enough colouring books, or had a meditation app, life would be easier to deal with. Now – in times of deep chaos, mindfulness is being replaced by something more radical: letting go. Problems with a project or your work? Do what you can do, and stop ruminating. Upset you still have to shield while others are spending nights maskless in pubs? Well, you can’t do anything about it, so just let it go. The guy you like not calling you back? His loss, move on. The idea that there exists a “best self”, and you can be it? Absolutely let that go. All through 2020 and 2021’s lockdowns, a book published in 2012 kept being recommended to me. Letting Go by David Hawkins was pretty new age – but its seemingly simple message resonated: I could always let something painful go, not let it get to me, and move on with my life. It may sound like a small, obvious thing, but when we are trained to strive, we can sometimes forget we have that option. “We hang on to pain. It certainly satisfies our unconscious need for the alleviation of guilt through punishment. We get to feel miserable and rotten,” Hawkins wrote. “The question then arises, ‘But for how long?’” In recent years, the letting go message has begun cutting through to the mainstream. Burnt out and traumatised by years of seemingly ever-accelerating crises – people are looking for a new way to cope. There are courses, podcasts, journals and more books post-Hawkins (Let Go, the Power of Letting Go, Let That Shit Go, the Little Book of Letting Go, the Language of Letting Go), all teaching us how to relinquish the things that are causing us pain or stress. Letting go started with objects, but now decluttering has moved on to the mind. The message in all of these self-help texts: surrender is the surest route to total fulfilment. Hawkins’ book had a ripple effect on my life. I was suddenly a lot more relaxed about things not working out. Instead of being caught up in a spiral of trying to control an outcome, I let go and moved onto the next thing. Sometimes I had to cut my losses, sometimes I felt real grief, some things I tried to let go of proved stubbornly resistant. But I made a start. In this technique was an echo of Stoic philosophy, including Epictetus’s maxim: “Don’t hope that events will turn out the way you want, welcome events in whichever way they happen. This is the path to peace.” It also aligns with Buddhist non-attachment theory, which is how Melbourne researcher and psychotherapist Dr Richard Whitehead came to the concept. For his doctoral thesis, he attempted to quantify the power of letting go, work that has since fed into a series of journal publications. He measured 1,100 people using a wellbeing scale, then interviewed those with the highest and lowest scores. “I … asked them about their life and how they got to that point of being able to let go of things,” says Whitehead. He found people who are older tend to let go easier, as do people who have a strong meditation practice. But “the most interesting finding of the whole paper was that suffering was the main catalyst for most people in terms of letting go. These people live their life without fixating on things. Eleven or 12 people who scored very high on the wellbeing scale talked about deep moments in their lives of pain and suffering. They also used some form of self reflective practice – such as journalling – when it came to letting stuff go.” The people that scored low on the wellbeing scale were “clinging” says Whitehead. “They had a lot of suffering but they were suffering from the negative effect of the event – they were still trying to control the event and the outcomes. They could not let go.” Letting go is counterintuitive in many ways. We are encouraged and taught from a young age to succeed, to push through, to have goals and let nothing get in the way. Half the battle is fighting your own deeply ingrained notions of how success works. Hugh van Cuylenburg knows a lot about success. His first book, The Resilience Project was a breakout bestseller, and he joined the speaking circuit – spreading the resilience message to schools across Australia and to professional sports clubs such as Essendon Football Club and Port Adelaide. But despite this, van Cuylenburg was caught in seemingly intractable problems. An inbuilt perfectionist streak and a desire to please others meant that he’d beat himself up every time he went to a party in a low mood. “I had an expectation of perfectionism and a belief that I had to light up every room. Letting go of this behaviour was about adopting a way of life that is much more sustainable,” he says. He lit upon the idea of letting go when he was feeling at a low ebb, burnt out after too many work commitments and travel. “I was addressing players [at Port Adelaide football club] at a pre-season and I was burnt out. On the way there, on the car radio my favourite song was playing and when I heard the lyrics ‘let go let go – there’s beauty in the breakdown’ it really resonated with me.” When he got to the club, he realised he could let go of the idea of giving the perfect presentation and be authentic about how grim he felt. The talk was a success because he was able to be honest. Since that night, letting go proved to be the key in overcoming problems that had dogged van Cuylenburg for decades. Now when his psychologist suggests that he let go, “I can feel the tension leave my body. We just don’t even stop and realise how much shit we are carrying.” Van Cuylenburg, whose latest book is called Let Go, singled out shame and perfectionism as an emotion that many people, including himself, need to let go of. “At a basic level we feel like we are not enough as we are,” he says. “We’re not smart enough, funny enough, good looking enough, rich enough. We are desperately trying to make up for this – look at the amount of money people spend trying to look better. From a young age we need to tell people we are worthy enough, we can belong.” Sydney-based meditation teacher Matt Ringrose, says that, in a decade of practice, “how do I let go?” was “the most common question I was asked”. Last year, he attempted to give people an answer, in the form of an online course, which he says was greatly inspired by Hawkins’ book. “Website traffic quadrupled since we put up the course,” says Ringrose. “People are searching for the term ‘letting go’. It’s gone through the roof. People are wanting to let go of the past – guilt, resentment, regrets, or they want to let go of anxiety about the future and achieving certain outcomes.” Ringrose believes that typically, letting go comes at an acute pain point, when holding on hurts more than moving on. It is something he experienced personally, at the end of his marriage. Previously Ringrose tried to overcome issues by “trying harder to control something”. “I would try to … bend the world to my will, whether it’s a relationship or business. I was quite good at manipulating the world. Then, I reached a certain point in life where it absolutely refused to be controlled. And the more I tried to control it – the more I found I was suffering.” There is a technique to letting go, says Ringrose, one that is bolstered through meditation. The other steps he teaches are “getting better at feeling feelings. Letting go is just feeling feelings – it’s allowing the feelings to be felt. It’s a lot easier than you think.” “Correcting mistaken beliefs” is also key. “You need to unpick the knots that are causing you to hold on – i.e. staying in this relationship will keep me happy, and so I need to hang on. When you realise you can’t control something – acceptance comes in.” “People think that letting go hurts too much but it doesn’t,” he says. “It’s the resistance to letting go … that’s the thing that hurts.” For Hugh van Cuylenburg, letting go “is a lifetime practice. I thought when I finished the book that I don’t need to do it anymore. Then at Christmas I had anxiety around making people happy – and it was a reminder that this stuff is ongoing. It’s hard but I need to keep remembering that I’m trying to undo four decades of programming.” Richard Whitehead believes learning to let go is a realistic way of coping with what the world might throw at you. “Mindfulness gets used to make things feel good,” he says. But letting go is “not clinging to the good times … not pushing away the bad things”. “It’s about feeling really down and low and embracing the bad things as well. They will pass if you let them go.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Sweet surrender: how letting go became a self-help phenomenon,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/01/sweet-surrender-how-letting-go-became-a-self-help-phenomenon
4/1/2022,"With Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané still physically and emotionally recuperating from Tuesday’s World Cup qualifying playoff in Dakar – complete with extra time, penalties and laser beams – various South Americans making late returns from distant internationals and the first leg of a Champions League quarter-final to come on Tuesday, there could hardly be a better time for a plucky underdog to turn up at Anfield. But even allowing for the massive advantages the division’s leading clubs hold over the upstarts, Watford’s record at their grounds is abysmal: in all competitions since 1990 the Hornets have played away at Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea and Manchester United a combined 38 times, equivalent to one full top-flight season (albeit one with a particularly savage fixture list). In this notional season they have earned a total of six points, with 34 defeats and a single victory, at Anfield under Graham Taylor in 1999. SB Liverpool v Watford, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST) Harry Maguire made headlines during the international break, but not for the excellent pass that helped to create England’s second goal against Ivory Coast or his solid all-round performance. Gareth Southgate was unusually strident after that match in calling the Wembley booing of the centre-back a “joke”, and Maguire’s creditable display will not harm his confidence. Playing for Manchester United seems to be a different matter, though, and perhaps one of the issues is that his club teammates often lack the quality of movement Ollie Watkins displayed in receiving the aforementioned pass for England, before setting up Raheem Sterling to score at the second attempt. Maguire may be happy to see that his old teammate Jamie Vardy will be missing due to a knee injury: Vardy has the sort of pace that can expose Maguire when turned, but the defender’s form for the national side shows what he is capable of as part of a well-coached and cohesive team. LM Manchester United v Leicester, Saturday 5.30pm After late smash-and-grabs against Norwich and Wolves in the run-up to the international break, Leeds fans have had two weeks to calm down and will be hoping for a considerably less stressful encounter when Southampton visit Elland Road. A combination of Covid, injuries and suspension meant Stuart Dallas and Dan James were the only two Leeds first-team regulars away on international duty. That will have given Jesse Marsch welcome time to work with most of the side he plans to send out to face visitors who have lost four consecutive matches in all competitions. Coincidentally, Leeds played Southampton immediately after the October international break and lost 1-0 at St Mary’s. Out of the physio room and on the bench against Wolves, Kalvin Phillips has announced his intention to sign a contract extension amid interest from Manchester United, Liverpool and Aston Villa. The defensive midfielder is likely to make his first appearance since early December. BG Leeds v Southampton, Saturday 3pm Finally Chelsea get a chance to watch someone who is genuinely exceptional at tackling and intercepting: while N’Golo Kanté, their famed interrupter, is ranked a sorry 110th on interceptions and a miserable 72nd for tackles this season, Christian Nørgaard has been the league’s most effective midfield enforcer, ranking first for tackles, first for successful tackles, second for successful pressing actions and second (or fourth, depending whose statistics you’re looking at) for interceptions. Brentford’s opponents do tend to have the ball a lot more than Chelsea, giving him more opportunities to exhibit his ball-winning skills, but still. The referee Chris Kavanagh takes charge of his seventh Brentford game, of which they have won 29% (those two wins are the last two he has officiated, including last season’s Championship play-off final). Chelsea, meanwhile, have won a statistically unlikely 91% of the 11 Blues games he has overseen. SB Chelsea v Brentford, Saturday 3pm Tottenham picked West Ham apart in their previous Premier League match, a result that conveniently looks to have knocked the Hammers out of top-four contention. Harry Kane pulled the strings that day, form he carried into a match-winning performance for England against Switzerland, and if the forward can continue to dovetail with Son Heung-min as effectively as he has been recently, Champions League qualification is entirely achievable for fifth-placed Spurs. Arsenal currently occupy fourth – three points ahead of Antonio Conte’s men with a match in hand – but are faced with a tougher run-in that includes trips to Chelsea, West Ham and Spurs, and a home game against Manchester United. A Contefied Tottenham appear to have every chance of overhauling their north London rivals. Barring disasters Newcastle already look safe, and perhaps Eddie Howe’s biggest headache – aside from those persistent questions about human rights in Saudi Arabia – is how to fit Joe Willock, Jonjo Shelvey, Joelinton and Bruno Guimarães into the same side. LM Tottenham v Newcastle, Sunday 4.30pm Turf Moor will host a meeting of teams with their minds on bigger occasions to come. City host Liverpool next weekend and Atlético Madrid in between while Burnley are about to start the key week of their season, featuring games against Everton and Norwich. Given those fixtures, and the fact they have lost their last nine matches against Manchester City by an aggregate score of 32-1, it is unlikely Sean Dyche will risk any player’s fitness for this one. This means Ben Mee will likely miss out and Kevin Long, who has spent 1,710 Premier League minutes on the bench this season and not a single one on the pitch, making his first senior appearance of any sort since last February. Back then, Long signed a new contract, started against Fulham and merrily declared “the manager here likes me”. SB Burnley v Manchester City, Saturday 3pm Aston Villa were unimpressive in defeat at the hands of Arsenal in their most recent top-flight fixture, a game in which Danny Ings was dropped to make room for an additional midfielder in Emi Buendía. With the Wolves manager, Bruno Lage, favouring a back three, Ings is likely to return to partner Ollie Watkins up front, where the pair will be tasked with creating spaces in which Philippe Coutinho can work his magic. Watkins and John McGinn both scored on international duty for England and Scotland respectively, while Jacob Ramsey got his name on the scoresheet with a thunderbolt for England Under-21s against Andorra. Despite the mugging they were subjected to in October’s reverse fixture, Villa’s confidence is likely to be high going into this West Midlands derby against a side that have had two weeks to put the trauma of their last-gasp defeat by Leeds behind them. BG Wolves v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm Was Everton’s win against Newcastle the beginning of a meaningful recovery or merely a false dawn? If the 4-0 FA Cup pummelling by Crystal Palace is anything to go by, there is no reason to believe the next few weeks are going to be anything other than unbearably tense for Everton’s supporters. Does Frank Lampard possess the managerial chops to keep them up? Is the squad good enough to avoid relegation? Did he decisively burn his bridges with his already struggling players with the rant about a lack of “bollocks” after the loss to Palace? Defeat at West Ham would be no disgrace but the trip to Burnley three days later is an absolute must-not-lose. The question of whether the players are all ready to pull in the same direction – and ready to fight for Lampard – looks likely to be answered in the coming week. LM West Ham v Everton, Sunday 2pm On paper this could be the worst game of the season, hosted by a Brighton side who have lost their last six games, scoring one and conceding 13, but still aren’t bottom of the form table. Not when this weekend’s opponents, Norwich, have scored four and conceded 17 in their six straight league defeats. So similarly matched are these sides that since mid-January their records each amount to losing those six league games, getting dumped out of the FA Cup, claiming a single 1-1 draw and beating Watford. The Canaries’ rapidly receding survival hopes rest on instant improvement: after Brighton this week and Burnley next, Norwich only face one other side currently in the bottom half of the table, and that is Newcastle. This season they have taken one point so far from games against top-half teams. SB Brighton v Norwich, Saturday 3pm Five months is a long time in football. It was Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who opened the scoring when Crystal Palace visited north London in October, a match that ended 2-2 after Palace’s fightback and Alexandre Lacazette’s late equaliser. For all his qualities, Aubameyang’s departure to Barcelona has helped Mikel Arteta to breed the kind of togetherness the Gunners displayed when Patrick Vieira was bossing their midfield. Vieira’s Palace have made a habit of arresting the progress of more illustrious opponents this season – most recently by holding Manchester City to a goalless draw at Selhurst Park – and will go into this match with no fear. Arteta is upbeat on the chances of Bukayo Saka being fit to play after recovering from Covid, while Vieira is hoping for good news on the hamstring injury that kept Wilfried Zaha out of Ivory Coast’s Wembley meeting with England. These late fitness tests look likely to have a significant impact on Monday’s match – and Arteta would dearly love to have Saka available.

4/1/2022,"More UK businesses are preparing to raise prices than at any time since the 1980s, heaping further pressure on hard-pressed consumers amid recent increases in gas, electricity and petrol prices. The British Chambers of Commerce said its latest quarterly survey found almost two-thirds of firms expected to raise prices over the next three months, the highest since the survey began in 1989. Amid warnings from opposition MPs and business groups that ministers should offer more support to struggling businesses, a record number of manufacturers and services firms said they would be increasing prices. The survey of more than 5,600 firms also revealed domestic sales had stagnated across most sectors and business investment remained at historically low levels. Investment in plant, machinery and equipment continued to stagnate, the BCC said, with 27% of firms reporting an increase in investment spending, while 58% reported no change, and 15% a decline. “This metric remains largely unchanged since the second quarter of 2021,” it added. This is despite a tax break since April 2021 that offers firms a deduction from their profits of 130% for each £1 of investment spending. Labour said the BCC survey showed inflationary pressures were gaining momentum, as the costs of imported raw materials and energy surged on international markets. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, said: “Instead of supporting business with spiralling inflation, the Conservatives are ramping up taxes and turning their back on energy intensive industries.” Last month, data showed consumer confidence fell back to levels last seen in November 2020, just before the second national Covid-19 lockdown. The widely used GfK index tumbled to -31 in March as consumers were hit by inflation reaching a 30-year high of 6.2%, record-high fuel and food prices, predictions of several interest rate hikes and higher personal taxes. After the chancellor’s spring statement last month, the Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, cut its estimate of GDP growth for this year to 3.8%, down from a previous estimate of 6%. When firms were asked by the BCC what pressures they were facing to raise prices, 92% of manufacturers cited raw materials, while 56% pointed to energy and transport costs among other overheads. A third of firms said the cost of labour was also influencing their decision to raise prices after increases in wages and a hike in the employers’ rate of national insurance from this month. The percentage citing recent increases in interest rates as a concern also rose in the quarter. Nearly one in 3 (32%) firms were worried about interest rates, up from 27% in the last three months of 2021. Overall, 62% of firms expected their prices to rise in the next three months, up from 58% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Only 1% expected a decrease in their prices. Suren Thiru, the BCC’s head of economics, said that while businesses had bounced back during the first three months of 2022 after the end of plan B Covid restrictions, rising inflation and the uncertainty caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine were likely to slow growth during the rest of the year. Thiru said: “High price pressures suggests that the current inflationary surge will escalate significantly in the coming months. The reversal of the hospitality VAT cut, the higher energy price cap and soaring energy and commodity prices amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, should lift inflation well above 8% in the near term.” He added that many firms still lacked the cash reserves to withstand further shocks, making them vulnerable to a long war in Ukraine and more persistent price increases. “The first quarter may be the high point for the UK economy with activity likely to stall in subsequent quarters as surging inflation, rising energy bills and higher taxes increasingly drags on activity.”",News/Business,More UK firms expect to raise prices than at any time since 1980s,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/01/more-uk-firms-expect-to-raise-prices-than-at-any-time-since-1980s-inflation

4/1/2022,"Independent MP Zali Steggall has signalled she could be more likely to support the Coalition in the event of a hung parliament if Scott Morrison wasn’t the leader. Steggall – who could be in a king-making position post-election if the federal result in May is close – told the ABC on Thursday night she had “grave concerns in relation to Scott Morrison’s leadership”. She pointed to “deep concerns within my community about some of the things that have occurred in the last few [years]”. Steggall said she would look at the substance of what the government would deliver to inform her choice. But pressed on the Q&A program about whether or not a different leader would make it easier for her to back the Coalition, Steggall said: “That is obviously an open possibility”. She also pointed to the influence of the National party over the Morrison government’s climate policy as a factor in any deliberation. Steggall said her constituents in Warringah – the blue ribbon seat she wrested from the Liberals in 2019 – were “incredibly frustrated at the stranglehold the Nationals … have over government policy, particularly around climate”. She said the government had adopted a “fake” announcement at the Glasgow climate conference last year when it signed up to a target of net zero emissions by 2050 because there weren’t the policy mechanisms to deliver the result – and the Nationals then extracted a multi-billion dollar regional development package in exchange for agreeing to the target. Tuesday’s budget earmarked more than $21bn in infrastructure and development spending – a quid pro quo for the Nationals adopting the mid-century target as policy. The government allocated money for inland rail, freight, the water grid and a regional accelerator program. Steggall was on the Q&A panel on Thursday night with the Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce. Asked whether she was prepared to support a minority Coalition government if Joyce was still the deputy prime minister, the independent replied: “I’m not in a position to answer that at this point”. “It will depend on policy”. Steggall said Australia delivering on its net zero commitment was an “incredibly important” factor for her and her constituents, and she added: “We know Barnaby holds Australia to ransom on that”. Joyce shot back: “Are you going to support Labor or the Coalition? It’s something you actually can answer tonight”. Opinion polls suggest Labor would win outright any election held today, but strategists on both sides of politics believe the contest is close, and could be close enough to deliver a hung parliament. Scott Morrison is attempting to reboot his political fortunes with Tuesday night’s budget, which included an $8.5bn cost of living relief package giving low and middle-income earners support to deal with rising consumer prices. Anthony Albanese used his budget reply speech on Thursday night to promise an additional $2.5bn to fix the aged care sector. Labor says it will also back and fund a pay rise for Australia’s aged care workforce. The House of Representatives adjourned on Thursday night, and Morrison is expected to call the election within days. Both leaders are campaigning in western Sydney on Friday.

4/1/2022,"Since the 2015 publication of Harper Lee’s second novel, Go Set a Watchman, it has become impossible to regard her first, feted book with the same innocence. Before then, To Kill a Mockingbird offered a beguiling child’s-eye view of a father’s stand against racial injustice in the deep south of the mid-1930s. Atticus Finch was the palatable white saviour who defended a black man in a hostile Alabama courtroom. But the second book’s indictment of Atticus as a racist, many years on from the doomed rape trial of Tom Robinson, irreversibly damaged his status as the story’s moral compass and heroic centre. So how to solve the problem of Atticus in any new telling of the original story? Aaron Sorkin finds effective ways in his confident adaptation, drawing out the lawyer’s moral inconsistencies without undermining his goodness completely. Rafe Spall’s quietly dignified Atticus is on the side of the law and a firm believer in American justice, rather than on the side of Robinson (Jude Owusu) or an early champion for race equality. The people of Maycomb are essential good, Atticus says, urging his children to respect their racist neighbours and to put themselves in the skins of the lynch mob that comes for Robinson, just as in the book. Except here the children decide for themselves what and who is right, and challenge him on it. The housekeeper Calpurnia (Pamela Nomvete, excellent) is also given a louder, angrier voice and she uses it movingly to stand up to Atticus too. Scout, Jem and Dill are all played by adults – a high-risk venture which pays off remarkably well, and brings gentle but genuine humour. Scout, the sure, stubborn tomboy is vividly played by Gwyneth Keyworth, Jem (Harry Redding) is less defined but still winning, while Dill (David Moorst) brings laughs but is the most contrived character. Dill was based on Lee’s close friend, Truman Capote, and he appears like a caricatured version of a young Capote: prissy, literary and comically fascinated by the etymology of words. The three bewitch and entertain nonetheless and jointly narrate the story so it becomes shared rather than Scout’s. Sorkin rejigs the narrative smoothly, weaving together the children’s world and the legal drama. The direction from Bartlett Sher is just as smooth, with some short scenes that yo-yo between the courtroom and the Finches’ porch but never feel brusque. Miriam Buether’s fast transforming set is fluid, mobile and unshowily gorgeous. While Lee’s novel gives primacy to the children’s games of make-believe for much of the early part of the story, this begins as a courtroom drama from the off, with a judge, jury and witness-stand wheeled on within minutes. Spall does not have the graceful self-containment of Gregory Peck’s screen version but is more impassioned and dynamic in the courtroom scenes. The drama of the courtroom, as a whole, is when this production comes most fully alive, the testimonies of both Bob and Mayella Ewell (Patrick O’Kane and Poppy Lee Friar respectively, both sensational) are filled with tension, anger, betrayal and disbelief. There are modern-day resonances of Trump’s left-behinds in their characterisations that feel utterly real and uncontrived; both father and daughter sneer at Atticus’s intellectual elitism and could be today’s forgotten populists of the rust-belt. The drama feels less taut out of the courtroom, particularly at the end when it winds up the plot. As a drama that hinges on Scout’s memories of heroic fatherhood, Atticus still needs to emerge as the story’s saviour, and he does so, although his final biblical invocations for change sound hollow. Its ends on a seemingly sugary note, infused by Atticus’s Christian hope, along with music and song. But this production, however quietly, offers a thorough indictment of the American justice system, from the bigoted white jury who convict an innocent black man against all the evidence in his favour – the echoes still resound today – to the vigilante justice condoned by the town sheriff. A dysfunctional judicial system, in an ugly southern town. One imagines the late Lee would approve.

4/1/2022,"Aid workers and journalists taken hostage in Syria by a group of British Islamic State militants were forced to fight each other until they passed out, a US court has heard. The group of three British men, nicknamed “the Beatles” by their captives, took more than 20 westerners hostage at the height of IS’s reign of terror between 2012 and 2015. El Shafee Elsheikh is on trial in Virginia, with prosecutors alleging he was the member nicknamed Ringo by the hostages. The Italian-born aid worker Federico Motka, who grew up in the UK, told the federal courthouse that he and David Haines, a British fellow aid worker, were made to fight John Cantlie, a British war correspondent and photographer, and the American journalist James Foley, in what the militant group called a “royal rumble”. “They were super excited about it,” Motka, who suffered 14 months of brutality at the hands of his IS kidnappers, told the court on Thursday. “We were so weak and shattered we could barely lift our arms.” He added that the trio humiliated them further by providing mock commentary of their forced fight, the Daily Telegraph reported. The hostages were told that the losers of the fight, which took place during the summer of 2013 when they were being held captive at a facility referred to as “the box”, would be waterboarded, the Associated Press reported. Foley and Cantlie passed out during the hour-long fight, Motka said. The group deemed the Italian the loser but never waterboarded him, inflicting a beating instead. Motka testified the trio’s individual preferences for torture. “George was more into boxing,” Motka testified. “John, he kicked a lot. Ringo used to talk how he liked wrestling. He would put people in headlocks.” Motka, who was surveying the needs of refugee camps in March 2013 when he and Haines were captured, is the first surviving hostage to testify at Elsheikh’s trial. “They said I was a posh wanker because I went to boarding school,” Motka testified. “They said I was arrogant, and they were going to take me down a peg.” The phrase “posh wanker” reportedly prompted a moment of uncomfortable laughter in the court, when the judge stepped in to ask what the phrase means, forcing Motka to explain the term’s meaning. Motka said he and the other hostages endured a lengthy “regime of punishment” when held at the site, including frequent beatings and forced stress positions. “They played lots of games with us,” Motka said. “They gave us dog names. We needed to come and immediately respond.” He recounted how, in late 2013 and early 2014, the hostages were made to wear orange jumpsuits, as the group wanted them to replicate the “conditions to the detainees at Guantánamo Bay”. Motka also testified he was waterboarded and electrocuted with a stun gun through a hatch in his cell “until my hands went rigid”. He was not released until 25 May 2014. The UK and US do not pay terrorist organisations for the release of hostages, which led to the executions of Haines, the British aid worker Alan Henning and four Americans named in Elsheikh’s indictment – Foley, Steven Sotloff, Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig. He is accused of involvement in their murder. In opening statements, prosecutors referenced three British nationals; Elsheikh, his longtime friend Alexanda Kotey, and Mohammed Emwazi, who frequently carried out the role of executioner and was known as “Jihadi John”. Emwazi was killed in a drone strike, while Kotey was captured alongside Elsheikh and also brought to Virginia to face trial. Kotey pleaded guilty last year in a plea bargain. Elsheikh’s defence lawyer Edward MacMahon said there was “no dispute” about the horror of the captives’ fate. But, he said, while there was “no doubt” that Elsheikh had gone to Syria and fought with IS, there also was no evidence he was one of the “Beatles”. The trial continues.

4/1/2022,"Australia’s boom in rooftop solar and large-scale renewables is fading as investors lose confidence, with the lack of coordination by the Morrison government partly to blame, according to the Clean Energy Council. The warning comes as the industry marked its latest record year for household solar, wind and solar farms, and big batteries. Renewable energy’s share of the electricity supply reached 32.5%, doubling since 2017, the council said in its annual report.In 2021, clean energy capacity grew by 6.3 gigawatts, or about four times that of AGL’s Liddell coal-fired power plant. The Liddell power station will shut the first of its four units on Friday ahead of a complete closure slated for April 2023. Renewables now generate 1.6 times the electricity used by Australian households, the council said. Last year alone, another 400,000 homes bought solar panels, adding 3.3GW, the fifth year in a row of record new capacity. Storage also had a “breakthrough year”, with 30 large-scale batteries packing a combined capacity and storage duration of 921 megawatts or 1,169 megawatt-hours under construction at the end of last year. The report also took aim at the Morrison government. It said Australia’s “troubled climate politics made some progress in 2021”, with the country committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, but the government had so far failed “to back the target with any meaningful policies [showing] that its leadership remains amiss”. The council’s chief executive, Kane Thornton, said this week’s budget had added to the disappointment, with “its lack of vision, its lack of tangible policies and commitments to support the transition” to a low-carbon economy. Thornton said that transition required national leadership and coordination, particularly for new transmission, to ensure funding and regulatory arrangements were aligned. As a result of the lack of leadership, 2021 could mark the high point for utility-scale projects for some time, he said. The level of financial commitment for new projects fell more than 17% from $4.5bn in 2020 to $3.7bn last year, meaning fewer ventures will proceed to completion this year and next. Thornton said the states were “doing as much as in most cases as they can, but it’s not well coordinated”. “That probably shows up most significantly in transmission where often you’re talking about projects across state boundaries.” A spokesperson for the energy minister, Angus Taylor, said the council had been forecasting a collapse in renewable energy investment for years. “Australians continue to prove the Clean Energy Council wrong,” the spokesperson said. “The fact is, there’s been more than $40bn of investment in renewables in Australia since 2017.” While the council doesn’t endorse one side of politics or the other, Labor’s “Rewiring the Nation” policy, including $20bn invested to upgrade transmission, was “exactly the sort of policy” necessary to manage the grid’s transition, Thornton said. Labor’s climate spokesperson, Chris Bowen, did not respond to a request for comment. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, blamed both major parties for the investment slowdown. “By so strongly backing more coal and gas, Liberal and Labor have blocked the pipeline for solar and wind,” Bandt said. “Renewables can win on price, but not if [both parties] keep using public money to prop up coal and gas.” Of the 9,331MW of large-scale projects either under construction or financially committed to, about half were in NSW alone, drawing more than $9bn and generating almost 21,000 jobs. The Coalition-led state has opened up five renewable energy zones to spur investment. Victoria and Queensland each attracted about $3.55bn in projects either under construction, or that companies have committed to. Thornton said the pace of rooftop solar was also showing signs of slowing in 2022. Higher energy prices triggered in part by the Russian invasion of Ukraine may provide a “positive signal” for consumers and for companies to ditch fossil fuels. “Here in Australia, there’s no doubt that those higher electricity and petrol prices present an incentive for businesses and households to shift to renewables and to shift to electric vehicles,” Thornton said.",News/Australia news,"Australia’s renewables boom fading as investors lose confidence, energy council says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/australias-renewables-boom-fading-as-investors-lose-confidence-energy-council-says
4/1/2022,"Children’s authors and performers say growing censorship, institutional timidity and online backlash are resulting in stories about diversity, sexuality and even contemporary world events being deemed inappropriate for younger readers. “It feels like we’re living through a second section 28, but one that the UK government has outsourced to an anonymous Twitter lobby,” one performer says. When acclaimed gay author Simon James Green was banned from school visits in the south of England by the Catholic church last month, it drew attention to what many believe is a developing trend that mirrors the escalating censorship of children’s reading in the US, described by Art Speigelman recently as “a culture war that’s totally out of control”. Savita Kalhan was expecting to take a school assembly with a group of teenagers for World Book Day recently. She planned to touch on themes of respect and consent that appear in her young adult novels That Asian Kid – about institutional racism in schools – and The Girl in the Broken Mirror – which includes a sexual assault. But the event was cancelled because the deputy head deemed her work “inappropriate”. “Since then, I’ve had lots of school librarians message me to say they believe the situation is getting much worse and more widespread, with a backlash against certain topics from school management and parents,” Kalhan says. “There seems to be a fear of something that might or might not happen, and it’s unnecessarily affecting children’s choice of reading.” “Young adult books, covering diversity, sexuality, even contemporary world events, are now being deemed unsuitable for teenage readers,” she adds. “This is completely out of touch with what teenagers are actually reading and watching, and the expertise of librarians themselves is completely overlooked.” Juno Dawson – author and former teacher, whose acclaimed sexuality handbook for young people, This Book is Gay, is the subject of removal petitions in the US – agrees there is “a shift in mood”. It’s part of a wider culture war, she suggests, now gaining traction in the UK. “You can’t stop a kid being trans or LGBT but you can stop a book. A lot of these attempts to have books pulled or readings cancelled feel vexatious, so huge credit to the librarians and teachers who are dealing with irate parents and campaigners.” Elle McNicoll joined Simon James Green on the platform for the Bristol Teen Book Awards the week after his ban, which she describes as sending “a painful message to young gay pupils”. “I’ve seen the absolute force for good that Simon is when he visits a school, and I’m just sorry that some children will be denied that joy.” McNicoll’s latest book, Like a Charm, includes a dyspraxic protagonist; her debut featured a heroine who is autistic, like McNicoll herself. “Diverse authors take on a lot more than questions about plot and story,” she argues. “We’re also often expected to fix societal problems or defend ourselves outside of our work.” Hazel Plowman, head of creative learning at the Bath Children’s Literature festival, says there has been a “definite shift” towards more inclusive stories in children and young people’s books since she started working there a decade ago. “We’re programming our autumn festival, and while there’s still work to do, we are getting all kinds of voices pitched as commercial books now, rather than being pigeonholed as ‘an issues book’ for example. There are LGBTQ+ books for all ages, picture books with two mums, British-Indian detectives and neurodiverse authors and characters.” Jodie Lancet-Grant is one of the authors Plowman lists. Her debut picture book for 3–7 year olds, The Pirate Mums – a swashbuckling adventure about a boy called Billy who happens to have two mothers – attracted some trolling earlier this year. “The idea that anyone would think this story is not appropriate for children beggars belief. It’s just a different family circumstance, but it’s incredibly important that children see that represented.” “There is a worrying trend of censorship of LGBTQ+ authors and books happening as a consequence of the more polarised world we are living in,” she says, suggesting that section 28 – the legislation enacted in 1988 to “prohibit the promotion of homosexuality” by local authorities and only abolished in 2003 – still has an impact. “A lot of adults grew up not reading about these subjects because of clause 28, and now assume they are not acceptable because they accepted that absence as children.” Drag performers have attracted particular controversy, with a number of schools caught out in recent years after booking an act seen as having a non-child friendly name or online presence. Sab Samuel AKA Aida H Dee, children’s author and founder of Drag Queen Story Hour UK, is clear that “not all drag acts are suitable for education”, but believes that schools and local councils are becoming increasingly aware of the potential for backlash, and consequently steering clear of anything that could be deemed risky. Adam Carver, whose drag performance for kids Palaver! generated complaints to local authorities and the Arts Council England last year, is blunt: “It feels like we’re living through a second section 28, but one that the UK government has outsourced to an anonymous Twitter lobby.” Carver’s company, Fatt Projects, is working on a model to support arts organisations facing similar attacks, offering advice on how best to respond to criticism. “There is a resurgence of the idea that queer people shouldn’t be around children,” he says. “There is a perfect storm now where venues and organisations are so afraid of backlash that they don’t take any risks. But there is still demand from children and families for work that explores difference.”",Arts/Books,‘Out of touch’: children’s authors describe increasing censorship of books on diversity,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/31/childrens-authors-describe-worrying-trend-of-censorship-of-books-on-diversity
4/1/2022,"Donald Trump blocked plans by his chief White House photographer to publish a book of pictures of his time in power – then published a book of such images himself, the New York Times reported. One former White House photographer told the Times that by using Shealah Craighead’s images for his own profit – with books selling for as much as $230, Trump is reported to have made $20m – the former president had dealt her “a slap in the face”. Craighead was only the second woman to be White House chief photographer, after Sharon Farmer, who worked under Bill Clinton. In 2018, Craighead told Marie Claire magazine that she and Trump had “a lovely relationship … very professional, but also … quite humorous at times”, and added that Trump had “a genuine, strong, caring heart”. She also said she was “always very cautious to make sure I’m not pushing the photos in a manner that are associated with me on a personal level, but rather associated with the president and the administration on a professional level”. Nonetheless, the Times said, at the end of Trump’s time in power Craighead reached a “tentative deal with a publisher [that] involved an advance in the hundreds of thousands of dollars”. A Trump spokesperson did not dispute that Craighead was first asked to have Trump write a foreword in return for a cut of that advance. But the spokesperson, Taylor Budowich, told the Times that Trump then decided to use the images and others taken by other official photographers for his own book first. “President Trump has always had an eye for beautiful and engaging curation, which came alive through the pages of his book,” Budowich said. Most former presidents sign huge deals with mainstream publishers. Trump, who left office after four years of bitter partisan warfare, two impeachments and the deadly Capitol attack, has not done so. But he has released a pictorial memoir, Our Journey Together, via Winning Team Publishing, a venture started by his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr, and a Republican operative, Sergio Gor. An unsigned copy of the coffee table book, for which Trump wrote captions, costs $74.99. Signed copies are $229.99. CNN recently reported sales amounting to $20m in just two months. White House photographers’ work is in the public domain, available to all via Flickr. But photographers commonly release books of their own work. Pete Souza worked for Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama and has released bestselling books of his pictures. He told the Times: “It’s valuable for each chief photographer to do a book just for the historic record and put it together in a way that it tells sort of their story and contextualises images.” Eric Draper, chief White House photographer under George W Bush, said Trump had been disrespectful to Craighead. “It’s a slap in the face,” Draper said. “I would be disappointed if I were in her shoes.” Speaking to the Times, Craighead said only that she was as “apolitical as possible, as I am a neutral historical documentarian. By staying neutral I am able to remain a keen observer.” But Stephanie Grisham, Trump’s third White House press secretary and the author of her own tell-all memoir, was less restrained. “Shea’s a very talented photographer,” Grisham said, “and this was really all of her hard work. I just keep thinking: what a shame that he is actually now profiting off of it. But then again, this is the guy who is hawking caps and all kinds of stuff right now to raise money for himself.” According to the Times, after it contacted Trump for comment, Trump called Craighead for the first time since leaving power. He reportedly said he was prepared to write her foreword now.",News/US news,Trump swooped in to profit from White House photographer’s book deal – report,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/31/trump-white-house-photographer-shealah-craighead-book
