1/29/2022,"Abnormalities have been identified in the lungs of long Covid patients that could offer a potential explanation for why some people experience breathlessness long after their initial infection. The findings, from a pilot study involving 36 patients, raise the possibility that Covid may cause microscopic damage to the lungs that is not detected using routine tests.  Breathlessness is a symptom in the majority of long Covid patients, but it has been unclear whether this is linked to other factors such as changes in breathing patterns, tiredness, or something more fundamental. According to Dr Emily Fraser, a consultant at Oxford university hospitals and a co-author of the study, the latest findings are the first evidence that underlying lung health could be impaired. “It is the first study to demonstrate lung abnormalities in [people with long Covid] who are breathless and where other investigations are unremarkable,” said Fraser. “It does suggest the virus is causing some kind of persistent abnormality within the microstructure of the lungs or in the pulmonary vasculature.” More work would be required to clarify the clinical significance of the findings, she added, including how the apparent abnormalities relate to breathlessness. Claire Steves, a clinical senior lecturer at King’s College London who was not involved in the work, said the findings would be of significant interest to anyone living with long-term breathlessness after Covid. “They suggest that the efficiency of the lung in doing what it is meant to do – exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen – may be compromised, even though the structure of the lung appears normal,” she said. “However, we really need to await the completion of the study to know whether these early findings are robust, and if so, how much they explain, and what the ramifications are in terms of potential treatments.” Fraser and colleagues are the latest to highlight physiological differences seen in people with long Covid, with research published this week pointing to an “antibody signature” that could help identify those most at risk. The latest study, which is aiming to recruit 400 participants, is using a specialised MRI imaging technique in which patients breathe in xenon gas while lying in a scanner. The gas can be traced as it moves from the lungs into the bloodstream, giving a reading of how the lungs are functioning. This contrasts with CT scans, which show just the structure of the lungs. The pilot compared three groups: patients diagnosed with long Covid who have normal CT scans, people who had been hospitalised with Covid more than three months previously and were not experiencing long Covid, and a healthy control group. The initial results, published on the bioRxiv pre-print server, show there is “significantly impaired gas transfer” from the lungs to the bloodstream in these long Covid patients, even when other tests are normal. Similar abnormalities have been detected in Covid patients who had been hospitalised with more severe disease. “These patients have never been in hospital and did not have an acute severe illness when they had their Covid-19 infection,” said Prof Fergus Gleeson, a radiologist at Oxford university hospitals NHS foundation trust and the study’s chief investigator. “Some of them have been experiencing their symptoms for a year after contracting Covid-19.” Gleeson said the team were now hoping to look at what proportion of patients with long Covid have abnormal scans, and determine the significance of the abnormality and whether it improves over time. Fraser said the findings did not undermine the relevance of rehabilitation programmes, such as breathing retraining for those with disordered patterns of breathing, for instance. “Rehabilitation strategies are really helpful,” she said. “We can make progress and set people on the right track, so people [shouldn’t] think ‘I’ve got lung damage and so there’s no point’.” Dr Louise Sigfrid, a public health specialist at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the research, said the findings highlighted the need for those who had continuing symptoms to be given comprehensive diagnostic assessments. “These early findings are really interesting, and in line with other emerging data on lung perfusion defects post-Sars-CoV-2 infection seen in adults as well as adolescents,” she said.",News/Society,Long Covid study finds abnormality in lungs that could explain breathlessness,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/29/long-covid-study-finds-abnormality-in-lungs-that-could-explain-breathlessness
1/29/2022,"Asweet-yet-sharp apple is the perfect accompaniment to wild game, and has a similar season from autumn to midwinter, when stored apples start to fade and the shooting season ends. An old apple still makes great cooking, though, and in today’s recipe I saute them with thyme and butter, then spoon over creamy braised pheasant. Like apples, pheasant is a humble ingredient that’s often wasted. Savills’ 2018 Game Meat survey found that only 48% of game shot on shoots is taken by game dealers, and suggested that a sustainable market needs to be created for this surplus meat. Game is nutritious and, from a good butcher, inexpensive, too.  This classic French dish marries two humble and often wasted ingredients in a harmonious stew. The rich, creamy sauce and umami-savoury meat are cut and complemented by the sweet, tart sauteed apples, which finish the dish. A Countryside Alliance poll found that 85% of consumers had never bought pheasant or partridge, but a high percentage were up for trying it, not least because this game meat is economical, nourishing and delicious. Both birds have a subtle flavour and make a great introduction to wild meat, though the dish can, of course, be made with chicken or other poultry, if you prefer. Cider brandy is a wonderful aperitif, and adds a real depth of flavour to this dish, but it’s by no means an essential ingredient. If you don’t fancy drinking cider brandy or calvados, and don’t want to buy a bottle for this recipe alone, the cider alone will suffice; otherwise, deglaze the pan with another spirit such as brandy, whisky or vodka. (When I first made this, I didn’t have any cider brandy to hand, so used whisky instead, and it was delicious.) I’d suggest serving this with mashed potatoes and/or crusty bread. If you want to step your mash up a notch, boil some celeriac and/or jerusalem artichokes until soft, blend to a puree and stir into your mashed potatoes with plenty of butter and seasoning. Serves 2 For the stock1 tbsp olive oil1 large pheasant, jointed into 2 legs and two bone-in breasts, including the giblets1 onion, peeled and grated1 carrot, grated1 stick celery, grated3 garlic cloves, peeled and grated6 parsley stalks3 bay leaves1 tsp juniper berries For the casserole2 rashers smoked streaky bacon, cut into lardons3 shallots, peeled and halved1 tbsp olive oil½ tbsp dijon mustard50ml cider brandy, or calvados or other spirit (eg, brandy, whisky, vodka)500ml cider250ml pheasant stock (see above and method), or chicken stock50ml double cream20g butter2 apples6 sprigs thyme To serve (optional)Jerusalem artichoke and potato puree, or mashed potatoes, crusty bread, winter leaves First make the stock. Heat the olive oil in a heavy-based saucepan over a medium heat, then add the pheasant carcass, heart, gizzards and any other offcuts, season well with salt and saute for 15 minutes, turning occasionally, until coloured on all sides. Add water to cover, bring up to a simmer and scrape up any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. At this point, if you have a slow cooker, transfer the pan’s contents to that and cook for four to eight hours on a low, trembling simmer; otherwise, simmer gently on the hob for at least two hours, and four ideally. Add the onion, carrot, celery, garlic, parsley stalks, bay leaves and the juniper berries, simmer for another hour, then strain through a cheesecloth or/and fine sieve and leave to cool. The stock will now keep, covered, in the fridge for up to five days. In a large casserole dish, saute the lardons and halved shallots on a medium heat until browned all over, then lift out and put to one side. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and the pheasant legs and breasts, then brown on all sides. Add the cider brandy, deglaze the pan, then return the lardons and shallots to the pot with the mustard and cider. Bring up to a simmer, cook for three minutes, then add the stock. Bring back to a simmer, lift out the pheasant breasts, then cover the pan and simmer the legs for an hour to 90 minutes, or until tender. Lift out the legs, turn up the heat and reduce the liquid by half. Stir in the double cream, return all the meat to the pan, return to a simmer and cook for five minutes. Take off the heat, cover and leave to rest. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Cut the apples into wedges (core them, too, if you prefer), then saute with the thyme until golden brown. Scatter the apples and butter over the top of the pheasant and serve from the pot, with mash or puree, wilted greens and good crusty bread.",Lifestyle/Food,Use up old apples in this sustainable wild game casserole,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/29/apples-sustainable-wild-game-casserole-pheasant-normandy-recipe-tom-hunt-zero-waste-cooking
1/29/2022,"Nasa wants help in proposing sustainable living techniques for a trip to Mars. On 18 January it launched the Waste to Base materials challenge: sustainable reprocessing in space on the crowdsourcing website HeroX. The challenge runs until 15 March, by which time entrants will have to submit their solution for how to turn waste materials into useful items for the mission. The four waste products Nasa is most keen for entrants to tackle are general trash, faecal matter, foam packaging and exhaled carbon dioxide. Nasa suggests that useful products could be propellants or feedstock for 3D printers.  Any journey to Mars will last for at least two, maybe three years. As such, it will be economically impossible to keep resupplying the mission. Instead, astronauts will have to live in the most sustainable way possible. Nasa aims to develop a robust “materials ecosystem” so these missions can take less and recycle more. At the time of writing, 27 teams and 373 individuals have indicated an interest in pursuing the challenge. Judging the entries will take about a month, and the winners will be announced on 26 April.

1/29/2022," In 1988, Bob Dylan was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen. Springsteen made a speech that started by describing a single sound: the snare shot that began Dylan’s revelatory 1965 single Like a Rolling Stone, which propelled music somewhere new. It sounded, he said, “like somebody kicked open the door to your mind”. So 1965 was the year that pop gave rise to rock: music with a new depth, plus a sense of revolt and confrontation. The Who released I Can’t Explain and My Generation. The Beatles came up with Help!, Ticket to Ride and the pairing of We Can Work It Out and Day Tripper. Dylan’s new adventures were heralded by the Byrds’ reinvention of his Mr Tambourine Man. But if anyone distilled the year’s mixture of noise, intelligence and revolt into its purest essence, it was the Rolling Stones, then at the peak of a pop-art phase that produced an amazing trilogy of hits: The Last Time, (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction and Get Off of My Cloud. If you want an idealised picture of life at the mid-60s cutting edge, the latter song should do it: “I live in an apartment on the 99th floor of my block / And I sit at home looking out the window, imagining the world has stopped.” In Detroit, Tamla Motown was producing records full of creativity and depth: Martha and the Vandellas’ Nowhere to Run; Smokey Robinson & the Miracles’ The Tracks of My Tears; the Supremes’ Stop! In the Name of Love. In Charlotte, North Carolina, James Brown and his band recorded Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag, Parts I and II, which blazed a trail into funk. This was also the year that David Bailey took his celebrated portrait of Michael Caine; Julie Christie starred in Doctor Zhivago and Jean-Luc Godard released Alphaville). In 1965, the idea that stuff by and for young people had to be full of ideas and importance was so firmly established that it has endured ever since; if there was a year when popular culture was invented, this was surely it.John Harris is the author of The Beatles: Get Back, the official companion to the Disney+ series When I think about my favourite years, I think about times when things are changing, and no one quite knows how. I think, in other words, about 1975, when Smokey Robinson released Quiet Storm, a light-headed falsetto fantasia about a lovesick man who compares himself to “a butterfly caught up in a hurricane”. The song was not a huge hit (it went to No 61 in the US), but an imaginative DJ in Washington DC was inspired by its smooth sound, and soon the name of the song became the name of a show, then a radio format. For decades, so-called Quiet Storm stations thrived, playing a mix of plush R&B and mellow jazz, an elegant counterpoint to the boisterous hip-hop that was just being born. Punk was being born, too: Patti Smith (her first album), the Ramones (their first record deal), the Sex Pistols (their first gig). And electronic dance music, in the dual form of sublime disco tracks (Silver Convention’s Fly, Robin, Fly; Donna Summer’s Love to Love You Baby) and electronic experiments (Kraftwerk’s Radio-Activity; Tangerine Dream’s Rubycon). It was the year of Ali-Frazier III, the Thrilla in Manila – a classic fight broadcast on an upstart network called HBO. And there were other new reasons to stay in the house: US department store Sears began to sell the first Atari video-game system. It was, I think, an unusually unpretentious year. It gave us crowd-pleasing classics such as Jaws and Monty Python and the Holy Grail, alongside a fistful of cult favourites: The Stepford Wives, Dolemite, The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Perhaps it was all a bit miscellaneous and confusing, especially if you were living through it. (I was not; I arrived the next year.) But that’s the thing about golden eras: they often don’t seem so golden at the time.Kelefa Sanneh is the author of Major Labels: A History of Pop Music in Seven Genres If 1984 was the best year for pop culture, that landmark period was countered at every turn by lower-end work that showed Ronald Reagan’s US as dysfunctional or corrupt. The inevitable re-evaluation of Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four began things. Apple released the first Macintosh. Ridley Scott directed the TV ad, alluding to the book. Represented by a heroine who shattered “Big Brother” with a hammer, Apple framed itself as against conformity. Van Halen named their new album after the year. Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA was misinterpreted and exploited by Republican politicians. With Purple Rain, Prince showed that self-creation is harder to co-opt. The MTV Music Video Awards debuted; Madonna writhed in a bridal gown on a wedding cake, singing that she was beat, incomplete. New York once again seemed like the capital of pop culture, with the painters Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Raw comics. Musician-performance artists Talking Heads and Laurie Anderson created a new, smarter, simpler pop aesthetic, and Run-DMC brought hip-hop to the world. At the movies, for every Footloose and Sixteen Candles, there was Jim Jarmusch’s Stranger Than Paradise or the Coens’ Blood Simple; for every Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, John Sayles’s The Brother from Another Planet. Eddie Murphy combined the two strains in Beverly Hills Cop, the highest-grossing film of 1984. It was pro-police or anti-cop, depending on your mood. There was a strong undercurrent in the US that things were not working. John Cassavetes made the disturbing Love Streams, while post-hardcore bands Hüsker Dü, Minutemen and Meat Puppets, recorded unpopular songs of anger and confusion, of what LA band the Gun Club called “Bad America”. The cinema of 1984 belonged to Harry Dean Stanton, who starred in Paris, Texas and Repo Man. He was also in Red Dawn, which US House minority leader Kevin McCarthy mentioned during his eight-and-a-half-hour filibuster speech last November. It was a reminder that at a certain level of American success, everything comes back.AS Hamrah is the author of The Earth Dies Streaming: Film Writing, 2002-2018. Look, I get that taste is subjective. But anyone who says that the best year in pop culture was anything other than 1989 is deluded or in denial. Let’s look at this question with the sober neutrality the matter requires: 1989 is when all the best genres of 80s movies peaked, and it is a scientific fact that the 1980s had the best movies and best genres of any decade ever, so this means these were the greatest movies ever created. In 1989, there was When Harry Met Sally … (the greatest ever romcom), Say Anything (the greatest ever teen movie), Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure (the greatest ever Keanu Reeves movie) and Batman (the greatest ever superhero movie and the movie with the greatest ever soundtrack because it was made by Prince). And you want to know something shocking? Prince’s Batman soundtrack was great, but it wasn’t nearly the greatest album that came out in 1989. What can a person even begin to say of a holy year that produced the Cure’s Disintegration and De La Soul’s 3 Feet High and Rising; two albums that have absolutely nothing in common, except that they remain as influential and modern-sounding as they were 33 years ago? Or one that birthed Janet Jackson’s Rhythm Nation 1814 and Neneh Cherry’s Raw Like Sushi? New Order’s Technique and Beastie Boys’ Paul’s Boutique? Pixies’ Doolittle and Tears for Fears’ The Seeds of Love? What albums have come out recently that will still be listened to in four decades’ time? Well, 1989 had about a dozen, while also gesturing at the best of the 90s to come, with the release of Nirvana’s Bleach and, on TV, the launch of The Simpsons. Taylor Swift didn’t name her most fun album 1989 for no reason, and Taylor ain’t no dummy. To close, four words for you: Madonna’s Like a Prayer. The defence rests, case definitively closed.Hadley Freeman is the author of Life Moves Pretty Fast: The Lessons We Learned from Eighties Movies You know that mindfulness tip for alleviating anxiety and grounding you in the present: to think of your “happy place”? My happy place is leading the conga line at my 10th birthday party in 1997, a dozen preteen girls in different Spice Girls crop tops wiggling along to Wannabe behind me. Come Christmas, we would be granted the cinematic triumph that was Spice World. An acid trip of a film featuring luminaries such as Richard E Grant, Bob Geldof, Elton John, Dominic West and Meat Loaf, it was slammed by the dreary critics, despite some frankly epic one-liners: “This dress is dry clean only, Melanie.” I was only vaguely aware that we’d entered the Blair Years, but even to my young mind things felt exciting – fruity, even – the air rich with optimism and excellent “chick flicks” (loathsome term) such as Romy and Michelle’s High School Reunion and My Best Friend’s Wedding. Most importantly, it was the year of Kate and Leo. Being just 10, I had to wait to watch Titanic on general release from the comfort of my blow-up chair, but my older sister went to see it at the cinema about seven times, contributing to the biggest box office release of all time (until Avatar came along 12 years later). I soon came to know Leo’s features better than my own, because my sister had not one, not two, but three Leonardo DiCaprio calendars. It is a year of seeing Leonardo’s perfectly greased blond curtains every single day. When I wasn’t lining up my £1.99 Spice Girls cassette singles like Pogs and rating the members of boyband 5ive in order of cuteness, I was dreaming about crystal chokers, matching crop top and miniskirt sets, and Gap-logoed everything. It was also, of course, the year that Princess Diana died, prompting a mass wave of public emoting that Britain had never witnessed before. For that reason, some might suggest it’s not the best year ever – but it’s inarguable that it’s among the most iconic.Pandora Sykes is the author of How Do We Know We’re Doing It Right? And Other Thoughts on Modern Life To categorise any year as “great for pop culture” is different from claiming that it was positive for culture. A good year for the culture at large involves transformations in thought; a good year for pop culture means that thoughts are chaotic and transitory, and art mostly discussed for how it is presented and perceived. For the past four decades, most years have been better for pop culture than for non-pop culture. But in 1999 the most interesting things were assumed to be disposable on purpose. Was there still “real culture” in 1999? Of course. The Sopranos debuted and is frequently cited as the apex of its medium. Yet what’s most regularly noted about it tend to be ancillary details: its invention of prestige TV; and a growing generational discomfort with antiheroes. It was an excellent year for film, but its signature movies have become symbols of ideological projections: The Matrix (now seen as a way to describe a mediated reality); Fight Club (shorthand for toxic masculinity); American Beauty (an evisceration of white suburban parochialism); and Star Wars: The Phantom Menace (the prime example of nostalgia as futurism). There was a shift in the perception of anything commercially dominant. Content mattered less than analysis of that content. The first Britney Spears album was released two days after The Sopranos pilot. Everything about it was fascinating – Spears’s celebrity, the marketing, the presentation – except for the music, which was merely OK. That dichotomy felt deep. It was now essential to take someone such as Spears seriously even if her songs were the least important aspect of her celebrity. Christina Aguilera put out her own CD, and could sing the quills off a porcupine – but again, the music was less crucial than her persona (most notably, her role as Spears’s alleged rival). In almost any previous era, both acts would have been popular, but dismissed as unserious. They would have been marginalised as music for kids who didn’t care about music. Such thinking was over. In 1999, the fact that teen pop was unserious meant you needed to think about it more.Chuck Klosterman is the author of The Nineties: A Book What was in the water in 2003? Its cultural output was so strong, it could nearly be forgiven for its disc belts and Von Dutch hats. The year saw Finding Nemo, two Christmas classics in Love Actually and Elf, and the first Pirates of the Caribbean film. And while we’re now sick to the back teeth of sequels, in 2003 they were still something to look forward to: Charlie’s Angels 2: Full Throttle, 2 Fast 2 Furious, X2: X-Men United, Bad Boys II and two Matrix sequels. The third Terminator film came out, as did the third American Pie movie and the final instalment of Lord of the Rings, which became one of the highest-grossing movies of all time. It was nominated for a whopping 11 Academy Awards (and won them all). It was a golden era for TV, too. We lost Dawson’s Creek but gained The OC. Chappelle’s Show hit screens in the US and so did NCIS. In the UK, Peep Show, Little Britain and QI were airing for the first time. BBC Three was launched, too. And let’s not forget: 2003 was the year reality TV came into its own. America’s Next Top Model aired, without which we wouldn’t have RuPaul’s Drag Race or Project Runway. Queer Eye for the Straight Guy was a watershed moment for LGBT+ representation. This era was the genesis of “rich bitch TV”, with Rich Girls following wealthy 18-year-olds Ally Hilfiger and Jaime Gleicher, and the much more famous offering The Simple Life, with Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. Madonna and Britney Spears’s kiss at the VMAs sent the world into meltdown. Beyoncé blessed us with her Grammy-winning solo debut Crazy in Love and the Dangerously in Love album. 50 Cent dropped his debut In Da Club and followed up with Get Rich Or Die Tryin’. Girls Aloud’s first album Sound of the Underground topped charts. iTunes was launched and so was Myspace, arguably establishing social media as we know it. It was a blessed year: technology was advanced enough to usher in genre-defining TV and films, but still gave us an optimistic naivety we may never see again. Not all it pioneered was good: 2003 was the first year the UK scored “nul points” at Eurovision with Jemini’s Cry Baby, becoming the first English-language song to do so. That’s a trend I think we’d all be happy to see the back of.Yomi Adegoke is the co-author of Slay in Your Lane: The Black Girl Bible",Arts/Culture,Golden years: what was the greatest 12 months for pop culture?,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/29/golden-years-what-was-the-greatest-12-months-for-pop-culture

Or when I’m next in need of a good ego-check. What were you hoping for?Someone who shares a passion for adventure. Failing that, someone who laughs at my awful jokes. First impressions?Confident and easygoing, and she looked stunning. What did you talk about?Our shared love of travel. The best heavy metal bands. And our experience with dating apps and terrible dates (I won’t share those stories here). Any awkward moments?It would take a lot for Krissie and me to get embarrassed! Though we were kicked out of the restaurant because we stayed past closing time. Good table manners?Absolutely – eating Japanese food can be a logistical nightmare and she was a seasoned veteran. Best thing about Krissie?I suggested we order each other’s cocktails all night. She was all for it. Would you introduce her to your friends?For sure, I think they would get on quite well. Describe Krissie in three words?Adventurous, unafraid, chatty. What do you think she made of you?I’d like to think she thought I was at least semi-bearable and kind of funny. Did you go on somewhere?We tried to go to a bar but had left it much too late to get in anywhere. And … did you kiss?Not this time. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?Maybe ordering less food to leave room for more drinks. Marks out of 10?10. Would you meet again?We have exchanged numbers, so maybe. It will all depend on her Blind Date responses …  Luke and Krissie ate at Nanban, London SW9. Fancy a blind date?

1/29/2022,"At this time of the year, the sun rises high enough to shine into my office shed at about quarter past nine; 10 minutes later it disappears behind the house, and then, later still, it sets. Generally those 10 minutes in the morning are all I see of the sun, except on the days when it doesn’t appear at all, which is most of them. I try to keep this moment of the day free in the event of a cloudless morning – it would be a shame to miss the only 10 minutes of sunshine in an entire working week because I got stuck on Wordle – but sometimes I’m not available for it.  Sometimes, for example, I will find that my presence is required in the kitchen at that time, so that my wife can debrief me regarding certain domestic matters. “Just say that again,” she says. “If your normal collection day is Wednesday, then this week it falls on Friday,” I say. “Next week Thursday, and back to normal the week after.” “And you’re sure about that?” she says. “This is the council’s website I’m looking at,” I say. “I’m sure the neighbourhood WhatsApp said something different.” I look across the garden to see the last of the sun reflecting off the back of my empty office chair and, honestly, I’m torn. “Let’s just leave the rubbish out all week, and see what happens,” I say. “That’s your idea of a solution, isn’t it?” my wife says. “Are we done yet, please?” I say. “Because I …” “You didn’t put the dishwasher on last night,” she says. “I forgot,” I say. “I didn’t think it was too much to ask,” she says. “But perhaps it was.” “It’s too bad we can’t just put it on now,” I say. “Oh wait – we can!” “Not yet,” she says. “There’s more stuff to go in it.” “What luck!” I say. I glance across the garden, where my office is already shaded in gloom, and my heart sinks. “I thought you were in a hurry,” my wife says. “Not any more,” I say. Over the 30 years I have lived in the UK, I have more or less adopted the local approach to January, regarding it as a bleak and pointless interval fit only to be waited out. But I’ve now reached an age when that attitude seems a little extravagant. I may well end my days begging for a few more crappy Januaries to live through. My wife has also decided we need a weekly shared activity to avoid slipping into hibernation, something beyond a wet walk on nearby scrubland. This is how we come to find ourselves at a site of historical interest clear on the other side of London on a Sunday morning. My jaw has dropped at the sight of the entrance fee for two adults, and I’m just letting it hang there, hands in pockets, while my wife pays. The woman behind the till explains that if we were to purchase a joint annual membership to English Heritage, the ticket price would be refunded, with many other discounts and benefits instantly accruing to us, including free parking. “Actually that sounds like quite a good deal,” my wife says. “This is a very, very slippery slope,” I say, leaning close to her ear. Three hours later we are on our way back home. “That was an interesting outing,” my wife says. “Where should we go next week?” “This is just for January, right?” I say. “Yeah,” she says. “That’s why I didn’t get the membership. We might not do it again for a whole year.” “And in two years we’ll be 60 and everything will be free anyway.” “Don’t say that,” she says. “Free buses and free cake. I can’t wait,” I say. “I don’t think they give you free cake,” she says. “Some kind of voucher,” I say. “That you exchange for cake.” “I don’t want to talk about this,” she says. At some point just after the close of the month the sun will rise above the roof of the house at midday, shining into my office for an extended period. By that time I will have started drinking again, and life will have regained some of its former lustre. Until then I’ve got one more visit to an unnamed museum, gallery or historic property, followed by a further blighted two years in which I am forced to pay for my own cake.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Tim Dowling: I get just 10 minutes of office sun – I can’t waste it on Wordle,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/29/tim-dowling-i-get-just-10-minutes-of-office-sun-i-cant-waste-it-on-wordle
1/29/2022,"There is a long hidden path that runs through the industrial estate where I live. It’s as straight and narrow as a railway line and, 100 years ago, that’s what it was. Now it is dog walkers and cyclists with cold breath that steam through its dark tunnels, their vests as neon bright as the graffiti. Dog walkers, cyclists and me.  I am particularly unwell at the moment, but all I want is to be outside. I love the path in winter: the stunted, skeletal trees that line it; all those gorgeous, branching fractals overhead. I like the mud; the dark other-worlds glimpsed in puddles; the deep browns of leaf litter pushed to the edges; the unexpected architectural shapes of scruffy hedgerow plants, frozen in decay. As the light dims, my boyfriend sets up my wheelchair with fleece-cosy and hot-water bottle, helps me into it, and pushes me along the path until it gets dark. Up and down: a slow, watchful locomotive. My vision isn’t great and I struggle to take it all in at once. Instead, I use my camera to focus in on small windows of interest, finding them by chance or directed by Fraser’s call. We find a hazel branch grown into a tight red knot; a sudden, thick carpet of cavernous green apples. The damp sawn stump of a tree glows like a headlight while clumps of orange fungus spatter its fallen trunk like fairy umbrellas. Blood-ripe berries hang on, silhouettes against the gloom, and the last of the light turns the odd yellow bramble leaf gold. I am enchanted, serenaded by robin song, preserving each detail: click. On our last walk, I decide to make a request. “Show me a nice bird today?” I call to the dark sky. I’d have been content with another robin, but it is a bullfinch that finds my lens, sitting still and watchful, bright as a bauble. Even in winter, in the urban gloom, even in darkness, nature is so generous. I take each photo to look at later, thankful, back in bed.
