4/12/2022,"Russia’s Vladimir Putin hailed his “brave” and “effective” troops in Ukraine on Tuesday, even as social-media posts surfaced showing the Russian military suffered yet another setback after more than 40 days of war. The Russian leader vowed that his “noble” war against Ukraine would be successful and defiantly said his country could not be isolated from the rest of the world. “There is no doubt that the goals and tasks of the operation in Ukraine will be fulfilled,” he said, claiming “confrontation with the growing anti-Russian forces in Ukraine was inevitable” and only “a question of time.” “The Russian Armed Forces have acted bravely, efficiently, and effectively in the course of the special military operation in Ukraine, using the most contemporary kinds of weapons,” he said. “What we are doing is helping people, saving people, on the one hand, and on the other hand—we are simply taking measures to ensure the security of Russia itself. It’s evident that we had no other choice, this is the right decision,” he said, according to Russia’s Interfax news agency. His glowing assessment comes amid reports that another high-ranking military official was killed in Ukraine. Lt. Col. Dibir Dibirovich Magomedovich, a Dagestan native, was killed on April 9, according to a now-deleted post on the VK page of a Russian military academy. A screenshot of the since-deleted post shared by Ukrainian media outlets shows that people were invited to make donations to Magomedovich’s family. Magomedovich was reportedly based in Chechnya with the 291st Guards Motorized Rifle Regiment of the 42nd Guards Motorized Rifle Division. No details were given on where, and in what circumstances, he was killed. His death adds to a long list of senior military brass killed in Ukraine, as Russia goes all in on drumming up support for the war at home, with huge “Z” symbols popping up on theaters and museums around the country and schoolchildren instructed to write letters of support to Russian soldiers in Ukraine. Meanwhile, evidence of possible Russian war crimes in the country has continued to grow, as Ukraine’s human-rights ombudswoman told The New York Times and the BBC that Russian troops held more than two dozen women captive in a basement in Bucha while they occupied the devastated town. Nine of the women in that group—which included girls as young as 14—are now pregnant, according to the ombudswoman, Lyudmila Denisova. “Russian soldiers told them they would rape them to the point where they wouldn’t want sexual contact with any man, to prevent them from having Ukrainian children,” Denisova told the BBC. In one of the most heinous allegations against Russian troops so far, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday confirmed reports that a Russian soldier sent around video of himself sexually assaulting a baby. “That is such a Russian military ‘defender of children,’” Zelensky said in a speech before the Lithuanian parliament, quipping that Russian propagandists will likely claim the alleged abuse was “protecting Russian speakers.” According to Russian media reports, the soldier in question, Aleksei Bychkov, was arrested on Russian territory, where he serves in Pskov. It was not clear where the alleged attack on the child took place. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.

4/12/2022,"A baker allegedly stabbed a Texas artist to death and set his body on fire moments after interviewing him on Instagram live about skull-shaped pastries, according to authorities. Manuel Tellez, 45, has been charged with murder in the deadly knife attack on Anthony Moreno, whose charred remains were found in an alley footsteps near Tellez's business. Officers found Moreno’s burnt corpse at approximately 9:20 a.m. on April 3 near the 1300 block of Kings Highway, Dallas Police Department said. Police allege in an arrest affidavit obtained by Oxygen.com that the two men had just finished broadcasting an Instagram Live interview about Moreno's Mexican “sugar skull art” — often called calaveras — and Moreno texted his wife around 12:15 a.m. that he was on his way home. Tellez then allegedly walked with Moreno to an alley about two blocks away from his business, the Maroches Bakery, and stabbed him multiple times. Tellez allegedly then left, changed his clothes and returned to the crime scene just under three hours later, where police say he doused Moreno in gasoline and set the dead man’s body ablaze. Surveillance footage from a gas station, taken around 2:00 a.m., allegedly showed the baker wearing a single white latex glove — similar to one found at the crime scene — surgical mask and hat while filling a portable gas can, charging documents stated. Police say that Tellez's Kia SUV, which has identifiable rust spots on its roof, was on the tape. A neighbor's surveillance camera allegedly recorded the start of the fire in the alley at 2:58 a.m. Police say that cell phone records showed Tellez at the bakery, the alley and the gas station at each time. Tellez and Moreno knew each other through the city’s arts community — and also had a mutual “romantic interest” in an unnamed woman. According to Moreno’s family, Tellez shared a link to the slain father’s GoFundMe, which raised more than $13,000 for funeral expenses, in the days following his death. “OMG I can not believe he shared this!” his wife, Ofelia Moreno, wrote on social media, the Dallas Morning News reported. “He killed my husband and made it seem like everything was normal.”  The 52-year-old artist leaves behind three children and six grandchildren, his family said. “I forgive the man that took him, unfortunately,"" Tony Moreno told Dallas television station WFAA. ""I do pray for the man who took my father’s life.” The grieving son described his father as a “godly man.” “He had a way with people,” Tony Moreno added. “He had a way to talk to people and befriend people and spread love."" News of Moreno’s death also shocked Dallas’ tight-knit arts community. “My heart goes out to the families,” said Ofelia Faz Garza, a poet, who had recently given a reading at Maroches Bakery, according to the Dallas Morning News. “He was a good motivator,” artist Modesto Aceves also told the newspaper. “He always got your back.”  No additional information was immediately released regarding the active case. Investigators for the Dallas Police Department declined to comment when contacted on Monday afternoon.  Tellez, who had a court date on Friday, is being held at a Dallas County jailhouse, according to online jail records obtained by Oxygen.com. His bond was set at $1.5 million.  Tellez’s defense lawyer declined to comment on the allegations against his client when contacted by telephone on Monday afternoon. “I’m not going to offer any comment at all,” attorney Jeff Lehman told Oxygen.com.",U.S./Oxygen,"Texas Baker Allegedly Killed ‘Sugar Skull’ Artist, Burnt Body After Instagram Live Interview",https://news.yahoo.com/texas-baker-allegedly-killed-sugar-213240182.html
