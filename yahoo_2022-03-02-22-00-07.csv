3/2/2022,"STORY: Over the weekend 70 German artists took 3.3 U.S. tons of paint onto a structure that has been slated for demolition and covered the 984 foot-long stretch of bridge with a message to Ukraine: Let us build bridges. ""Above all we want the message to reach the people in Ukraine so that they know that other people are thinking about them and feeling for them and are involved for them. That was the main message we wanted to send and that's why we did this,"" said one of the organizers, Davis Pahl. The Luedenscheid initiative painted the lettering and a peace sign in Ukrainian colours on the Rahmedetal bridge over the A45, which is in danger of collapsing and has been closed to traffic and people before it will eventually get demolished. In Vilnius, the Mayor of the Lithuanian capital painted a different message: 'Putin, the Hague is waiting for you"" on a road next to Russian embassy, as Ukraine braces for the bombardment of its capital Kyiv. When elected in 2015, the Vilnius Mayor Remigijus Simasius ordered a removal of the last remaining Soviet monumental statues in the country, calling them ""a lie"", and has since joined the paramilitary to train for resistance against an attack. The Lithuanian government on Monday (February 28) said it would ask the International Criminal Court in the Hague to investigate Russia for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Giant graffiti across Europe sends message to Putin,https://news.yahoo.com/giant-graffiti-across-europe-sends-120211043.html
3/2/2022,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned that a third world war would be “nuclear” and “destructive,” essentially warning NATO not to intervene militarily in Ukraine, a day after peace talks failed to temper the bloodshed and as Russian paratroopers descended on the city of Kharkiv, the second largest city in the nation and the epicenter of fierce fighting. Ukraine’s defense ministry confirmed the arrival of Russian airborne troops on Telegram, though it is unclear if they are involved in a ground battle just yet. “There is an ongoing fight between the invaders and the Ukrainians,” they said. Authorities confirmed Wednesday midday that “massive shelling and bombing” as well as urban warfare was underway. Images showed municipal buildings in the city center on fire. Ukraine’s interior minister said that more than 2,000 civilians had already been killed in the six-day-old conflict. Kharkiv was paralyzed by increased fighting Wednesday morning, with Ukrainian Interior Ministry Adviser Anton Gerashchenko confirming that a Russian airstrike ignited the barracks of a flight school that housed some Ukrainian troops. “Practically there are no areas left in Kharkiv where an artillery shell has not yet hit,” he said in a statement on Telegram Wednesday morning. The mayor of Kharkiv said Wednesday that 21 people had been killed in overnight fighting, pushing the death toll higher. Russia also claimed early Wednesday to have taken control of the port city of Kherson, which the Ukrainian military denies. “According to the information from our brigade the battles are going on now,” a Ukrainian military spokesman told CNN. “The city is not captured totally, some parts are under our control.” ‌ Russian troops in a 40-mile long convoy are now around 15 miles from the capital Kyiv as precision attacks slammed a TV tower and devastated a Holocaust memorial site and private maternity clinic on Tuesday continue to “soften” the city for what many believe is an imminent ground invasion. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky gave CNN and Reuters interviews from a fortified bunker deep below a building in Kyiv on Tuesday, the first face-to-face interactions he has had with Western journalists. He told CNN, “Everyone has to stop fighting before we’re ready to talk about peace.” When asked if the negotiations were a waste of time if Russia continued shelling, he said, simply, “We’ll see.” A number of military analysts say that the existence of the convoy backs up Russia’s claim that it does indeed control Ukrainian air space, leaving them unable to attack the somewhat vulnerable convoy. Kyiv mayor, the former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, vowed to hold the city. “We stayed in front of one of the strongest armies in the world. The will to be independent is (the) main priority for us. And we’re defend(ing) our families, our city, our country and our future,” he told CNN Wednesday. “There is a huge patriotic movement right now. Old people—can you imagine—doctors, actors, actors from theater, many professions that never had expectation to fight, to keep weapons, but right now they (are) coming to us. They’re ready to fight. It’s amazing.” Reaction inside the war theater to President Joe Biden labeling Vladimir Putin a “dictator” in his State of the Union speech was muted, with analysts predicting the Russian president would not react. “I think those personal comments by Joe Biden were probably things that would get under—into the craw of the Russian president,” CNN’s former Moscow bureau chief and expert on Russian affairs Jill Dougherty said. “Things like ‘dictator, Putin alone is to blame, more isolated than ever.’ But I don’t think they’re going to engage in that. You know, you can’t really defend yourself by saying ‘No, I’m not a dictator.’ But what they can do is try to pick apart the argument.” Meanwhile, inside Russia, clearly fearing an exodus of the country’s wealthy multinationals who have secured European passports through residency, Putin has signed a decree to block anyone from leaving the country with more than $10,000 in foreign currency to “ensure Russia’s financial stability,” according to the Kremlin. Oleksiy Arestovich, a top aide to Zelensky, noted Wednesday that Russian soldiers were getting increasingly younger. “The Russian Army is running out of resources,” he told the UNIAN news agency. “They are sending cadets from military academies to war, a troop of second-year cadets of a military school has surrendered to us.” If confirmed, it would help explain why Russia’s much-feared military is not able to move faster. On Wednesday morning, Russia announced its delegation “would be in place” for new talks with Ukraine negotiators later in the day, though no location was announced. Tass news agency later confirmed that an aide to Zelensky said the Ukrainian delegation would be at the table for a second try to reach a peace accord to stop the deadly conflict.

3/2/2022,"STORY: Russia’s top bank is quitting most European markets. Sberbank blames big cash outflows and threats to its staff and property. The move comes amid tough western sanctions on Russian lenders in connection with the Ukraine crisis. It seemed inevitable after the European Central Bank ordered a closure of Sberbank’s EU arm. The ECB said it faced failure because of a run on deposits. Russia’s central bank has also told the firm to stop supplying cash to European subsidiaries. Moscow wants to hang on to foreign currency as much as possible. It all comes just as Sberbank reports record profits. On Wednesday (March 2) it said they jumped 64% in 2021, hitting over $12 billion. But Russian lenders are now under intense pressure, with many excluded from the SWIFT system of global payments. Sberbank had already said last year that it would sell operations in Croatia, Hungary and elsewhere. The latest announcement does not affect its unit in Switzerland, which continues to operate. London-traded depositary receipts for the bank were down 90% Wednesday, changing hands for just 1.7 cents.",Business/Reuters Videos,Top Russian lender Sberbank quits Europe,https://news.yahoo.com/top-russian-lender-sberbank-quits-123502965.html
3/2/2022,"Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin retweeted a screenshot from Tucker Carlson's show on Monday. The Pentagon quickly clarified that it was the result of ""a fat finger mistake."" The screenshot was from one of the Fox News host's pro-Putin monologues. After Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin retweeted a screenshot from one of Tucker Carlson's pre-invasion monologues sympathetic to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Pentagon's press secretary said it was an accident. ""It was a fat finger mistake by one of our social media guys,"" Jon Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, told Politico's Alex Ward. ""He undid it immediately."" The screenshot showed Carlson arguing that Russian President Vladimir Putin had no intentions of war, instead simply seeking to ""keep his western border secure."" Carlson has since changed his tune, jettisoning his mocking of the Ukrainian government and defense of Putin for a more simple condemnation. ""He is to blame for what we're seeing tonight,"" Carlson said of the dictator in his opening monologue Thursday night. ""Again, what Russia has done is awful, but we can make it worse,"" he said later in the show. Ahead of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last week, Carlson frequently argued that Putin was being unfairly characterized by mainstream media outlets and Democratic lawmakers. ""Since the day that Donald Trump became president, Democrats in Washington have told you you have a patriotic duty to hate Vladimir Putin,"" Carlson said on his show February 22. Carlson was highly dismissive of the likelihood of an invasion. In the same monologue, he mockingly asked whether Putin is the real enemy compared to China, drug cartels, and American teachers. ""What is this really about?"" Carlson said. ""Why do I hate Putin so much? Has Putin ever called me a racist? ""Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him?"" he continued. ""Has he shipped every middle-class job in my town to Russia? Did he manufacture a worldwide pandemic that wrecked my business and kept me indoors for two years? Is he teaching my children to embrace racial discrimination? Is he making fentanyl? Is he trying to snuff out Christianity? Does he eat dogs?""   Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/INSIDER,Pentagon says it was 'a fat finger mistake' when Biden's defense secretary retweeted a screenshot from one of Tucker Carlson's pro-Putin monologues,https://news.yahoo.com/pentagon-says-fat-finger-mistake-165742201.html
