3/19/2022,"* Biden urges Xi to abandon Moscow over Ukraine * FedEx falls on lower-than-expected quarterly earnings * Moderna up on seeking FDA authorization for second booster * Dow down 0.35%, S&P up 0.14%, Nasdaq gains 0.93% (Adds comments, updates prices to early afternoon) By Shreyashi Sanyal and Sabahatjahan Contractor March 18 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 indexes inched higher in volatile trading on Friday as megacap stocks gained ground, while investors assessed the talks between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping over the Ukraine crisis. Nvidia, Tesla, Apple and Microsoft rose between 0.6% and 2.9%, boosting the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Biden and Xi spoke on a video call, which lasted just under two hours, about Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Chinese media said Xi underlined that such conflicts are in no-one's interests. Biden was expected to tell the Chinese leader that Beijing would pay a steep price if it supports the invasion. ""The geopolitical concerns are responsible for the vast majority of the market movement this week, despite the fact that the Fed hiked interest rates,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. ""China is kind of involved a little bit more today than normal, and that's obviously a concern."" The day also marks ""triple witching"", where investors unwind positions in futures and options contracts before they expire which often leads to large unexpected moves in markets. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with technology, consumer discretionary and communication services the only gainers, up between 0.5% and 1.1%. ""The bottom has been touched, and technology is down such a significant amount from its highs, it was bound to bring in people looking for opportunities,"" said Rick Meckler at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. Wall Street's main indexes tracked their biggest weekly gain since November 2020 after a rally that was fueled by hopes for progress in the Russia-Ukraine peace talks and a widely expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. The U.S. central bank on Wednesday also forecast an aggressive plan for further hikes while trimming economic growth projections for the year. At 11:43 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 119.47 points, or 0.35%, at 34,361.29, the S&P 500 was up 6.26 points, or 0.14%, at 4,417.93 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 126.45 points, or 0.93%, at 13,741.24. Moderna Inc gained 4.9% after the drugmaker submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to allow for a second booster of its COVID-19 vaccine. Shares of Boeing Co rose 0.7% on reports that the planemaker was edging towards a landmark order from Delta Air Lines for up to 100 of its 737 MAX 10 jets. U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp fell 5.0% as it posted lower-than-expected quarterly earnings on Thursday. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.03-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.36-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 18 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 30 new highs and 25 new lows.

3/19/2022,"LVMH chief executive Bernard Arnault, the world's third-richest man, is said to be deciding which of his five children will take over the empire. The company recently moved to raise its age limit for a chief executive officer so Arnault can stay on. Arnault, 73, has run the luxury conglomerate for decades. His net worth is estimated at $155 billion. LVMH includes fashion brands Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, champagne producer Moët & Chandon, and watch company TAG Heuer. The CEO could use this time to think about which one of his children will take over, according to a recent Fortune article. The aging patriarch and his five children vying for power closely mirror HBO's series Succession. Meet Arnault's five talented children who could one day run LVMH. The French businesswoman is 46 and the VP of Louis Vuitton. She attended the EDHEC Business School in Lille and the London School of Economics. She began her career at McKinsey in Paris, where she worked as a consultant for two years and learned strategy, according to the Financial Times. She acquired experience in the fashion industry while working at designer John Galliano’s company in 2000, helping develop the brand. Between 2001 and 2013, she started working at Christian Dior in the shoe department and rose to deputy managing director for the executive committee. During this time, she oversaw one of the label’s most successful periods, steering the growth of leather goods, accessories, and communication strategies. Since then, she has become executive vice president of Louis Vuitton and is in charge of supervising the brand’s product-related activities. She follows a calm management style and tends to visit stores when they are at their busiest. The successful businesswoman also sits on boards such as Château Cheval Blanc, The Saint-Emilion Premier Grand Cru, Les Echos, Loewe, Pucci’s, Celine, Christian Dior, 21st Century Fox, and Repossi. Since 2009, she has been a member of the supervisory board of M6, and in 2013 she joined the supervisory board of Havas. Delphine is also a supporter of the LVMH Prize, which allows young fashion designers to be coached by LVMH professionals. In 2014 she was also named one of Fortune’s 40 under 40. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4qO91ITy3I Antoine, 44, is the head of communications and image at LVMH. He is also the chairman of Loro Piana and chief executive of Berluti. The oldest son got his first chief executive role at Berluti, transforming the luxury shoemaker into a menswear label. In 2002, when Arnault was 25, he cofounded an internet startup and started working in LVMH’s marketing team. He then got his MBA from Insead and, in 2005, rejoined LVMH in the advertising department. Two years later, he was made director of communications at Louis Vuitton. Under this role, he launched the “core values” campaigns, which featured international figures like Muhammad Ali, Angelina Jolie, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Bono. In 2011, he launched Les Journées Particulières, in which members of the public were invited to visit the LVMH ateliers and witness the craftsmanship. This festival takes place across 14 countries and encourages LVMH brands to open their doors to the public. He was appointed chairman of Loro Piana two years later, after his father purchased 80% of the cashmere retailer. In 2018, he took on his current role at LVMH and was tasked with managing the iconic fashion house's image. A year later, after a personal friend bought Laperouse, a historic Parisian restaurant, Arnault took a minority stake. Like his sister Delphine and his father, he sits on the board of LVMH. According to the Wall Street Journal, he is married to Natalia Vodianova, a Russian model, and is passionate about golf. https://www.instagram.com/p/BzATXCsoM8I/ At 29, Alexandre is fluent in French, English, and German, and the VP at Tiffany. He graduated from Telecom ParisTech and got a master’s in innovation from École Polytechnique. His digital experience has helped the fashion conglomerate launch 24 Sevres, its e-commerce platform. In 2017, he was appointed to lead the luxury luggage bag maker Rimowa after LVMH announced that it would acquire an 80% stake in the company. This acquisition was a key move as Rimowa was the last luxury luggage brand left on the market after Samsonite acquired Tumi. The brand influenced LVMH’s digital strategy and collaborations with Supreme, Off-White, and Fendi. In 2019, he took over his father’s seat on the board of directors at Carrefour, the French supermarket chain. Finally, last year he became executive vice president of product and communications at Tiffany & Co. In that role, Alexandre has already started shaking things up with his contemporary and modern approach. According to the Wall Street Journal, CEO Anthony Ledru described him as 40% analysis and 60% gut feeling, a go-getter that made things happen sooner rather than later. Thanks to him, Jay-Z and Beyoncé agreed to do the “About Love” campaign for the jewelry company, which featured a Tiffany-blue Basquiat painting. In 2021 he married Géraldine Guyot, a young designer. The union was first celebrated in Paris and then in Venice. A grand ceremony was held and attended by Roger Federer, Pharrell Williams, the Carters, and Kanye West, who also performed. https://www.instagram.com/p/CUIV6-uI7Uf/ Frédéric, 27, is the chief executive at TAG Heuer, a luxury watch brand. He studied at the École Polytechnique and ran a mobile payment startup with a friend, which they later sold to BNP. He then joined TAG Heuer full-time as the director of strategy and digital. When Frédéric was 25, he was named CEO of TAG Heuer, making him the second-youngest Arnault to obtain that position after his brother Alexandre. While he puts a lot of focus into connected watches, which now constitutes 15% of all sales, his main focus is e-commerce, which grew 329% in 2020. It was also thanks to him that TAG Heuer got a key partnership with Porsche. In 2020 he entered the spotlight after he partnered with Ryan Gosling after taking the reins of TAG Heuer. In the beginning, the partnership seemed unusual because the actor had no social media presence and had never endorsed a product before. However, Frédéric saw an opportunity and finally signed a two-year deal with Gosling after a year and a half of negotiations. Last year, it reported revenues of $7.1 billion from its watch and jewelry sector in the third quarter. The young businessman’s history with TAG Heuer dates back to when he was 11 and received a TAG Heuer Aquaracer from his father. In 1999 his father bought the brand, and it has become the most significant watch brand in LVMH’s portfolio. Frédéric is also a man of many talents and plays the piano and tennis, and is fluent in English, Italian, and German. https://www.instagram.com/p/B9sBaTsoEyI/ At 23, Jean is the director of marketing and development for Louis Vuitton watches. Louis Vuitton launched its watch factory in 2003. The youngest Arnault got his master's degrees in mechanical engineering from Imperial College London and financial mathematics from MIT. His interest in the watchmaking industry peaked after his brother Frédéric told him about what he was doing at TAG Heuer, and he studied at the label's watch institute. Even though he just started in the business world, the future is bright. Jean told the Financial Times that he sees huge potential in mechanical watches during the digital, connected revolution. The more his generation connects their lives with devices, the more they desire something strictly mechanical. https://www.instagram.com/p/Ca5GcjmrQl7/ This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Business/Fortune•2 days ago,Meet the 5 billionaire Arnault children vying to take over their father’s LVMH empire in a real-life ‘Succession’ plot,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meet-5-billionaire-arnault-children-185942958.html

3/19/2022,"By Hilary Russ NEW YORK (Reuters) -Burger King's parent company said on Thursday it has not been able to close its 800 restaurants in Russia because its independent operator there ""refused"" to do so. Restaurant Brands International Inc said that to enforce its contracts with the partner, Alexander Kolobov, it would need the help of the Russian government, but ""we know that will not practically happen anytime soon,"" according to a letter to employees from David Shear, president, international, of the company. Kolobov said in a statement to Reuters that he does not have the authority or power to decide whether to suspend restaurant operations. Shear's long letter and Kolobov's response highlight the many complications bedeviling some American fast-food brands as they try to halt operations in Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. It also exposes what can become a point of weakness in international franchising, which is how most American restaurant brands expand overseas: the relationships with their independent operators. On March 8, Starbucks Corp and a wave of other companies followed McDonald's Corp in saying they would suspend or limit operations in Russia. Like Burger King, Starbucks does not own or operate its more than 100 cafes there. But unlike Burger King, it had a willing partner - Kuwait-based Alshaya Group - that immediately agreed to shut its Starbucks' locations in Russia and support its 2,000 employees. Restaurant Brands entered Russia a decade ago through a joint venture partnership with three entities: Kolobov, who controls day-to-day operations, private equity and asset management firm Investment Capital Ukraine, and Russia's state-owned VTB Bank, which has been hit by Western sanctions. Restaurant Brands has started the process to dispose of its 15% ownership stake in the joint venture. It wants to do so immediately, Shear said, but it will take ""some time"" based on the terms of the agreement. There are ""no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any one of the partners to simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement,"" Shear wrote. ""Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today?"" he wrote. ""No."" Kolobov said he has never had control of operations since the joint venture formed in 2012. He controls 30% of the partnership and said the decision to suspend operations ""must be taken by all shareholders considering the impact it may have"" on approximately 25,000 employees.

3/19/2022,"Stock markets aren't behaving the way they're supposed to. U.S. markets surged after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its long-awaited interest rate hike on Wednesday, increasing interest rates by a quarter point and signaling there might be six more rate hikes this year. In theory, higher interest rates are supposed to make stocks less attractive, because higher rates mean increased borrowing costs for companies and consumers, lowering overall spending. But investors shirked that conventional wisdom and piled into the stock markets, rallying the S&P 500 to close 2.2% higher than the start of the day. The S&P 500 dipped briefly into the red immediately after Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced rate hikes, but recovered to end at a high for the day. The Dow Jones industrial average also went into negative territory briefly before recovering to end 1.6% higher. The Nasdaq followed a similar pattern—a brief dip after the Fed’s announcement, only to surge to close 3.7% higher for the day. ""Usually, the stock market is reflecting what’s best for the economy, so if interest rate hikes are best for the economy, then stocks will respond to that,” Andrew Hiesinger, CEO of Quant Data, told Fortune. U.S. markets already started strong Wednesday, on news of positive movement in negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, as well as signals from Beijing that it would start to roll back its broad regulatory crackdown. And, rather than worrying that rate hikes would affect equity values, investors may just be relieved that the Federal Reserve is taking action to fight the highest level of inflation in decades. The rate hike ""seems very much like [the Federal Reserve] wanted to send a message that they’re fighting inflation and they’re going to fight it fast and get it under control,” Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, told the Wall Street Journal. Investors may also have been reassured by Powell’s belief that the U.S. economy was strong enough to withstand more restrictive monetary policy measures. “Monetary tightening means the Fed believes the economy is on solid footing, which is a good thing at the end of the day,” Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy for E*Trade, told CNBC. Historical patterns suggest that while stocks tend to fall in the month after a rate hike, they end up recovering to see solid gains within a year. An analysis by Evercore ISI found that in the previous four rate hike cycles—periods when the U.S. Federal Reserve steadily increases interest rates—the S&P 500 fell by 4% in the first month, yet was 5% higher on average one year later. Market optimism continued into morning hours in Asia. The Nikkei opened 3% higher, while the Hang Seng opened 6.6% higher, continuing its 9% surge from the day before.

3/19/2022,"Warren Buffett’s long-term outlook on investments proved successful once again this week when Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) shares closed above $500,000. If there’s one thing that’s made Buffett one of the most successful investors in history, it’s his commitment to his strategy. A countless number of new investment techniques and algorithms have come and gone over the years, but Buffett has maintained his fairly simple strategy of picking solid companies and focusing on long-term growth while somehow ignoring the noise that sends most investors into a panic. It may seem odd that somebody with such a disciplined long-term approach to investing has no interest in purchasing real estate, especially since it's what vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Charles Munger used to build his fortune. There’s a Difference Between Buying Real Estate and Investing in Real Estate Buffett isn’t opposed to investing in real estate and has invested in several real estate investment trusts (REITs) over the years. However, he knows it makes little sense to get into the business of being a landlord. Buying and managing real estate is more of a business than it is an investment, and Buffett knows that his time is better spent choosing companies to invest in than it is running a real estate business. Real estate is a tough business and one that needs to be scaled to comprise several properties in order to build significant wealth. Many individual investors get into real estate with the misconception that it’s a passive investment, and most eventually exit those properties once realizing what they’ve actually gotten into. Investing in real estate is a different story. Passive real estate investments allow investors to reap the rewards of this profitable asset class without taking on the management responsibilities. The FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs index has outperformed the S&P 500 in total returns during 13 out of the last 20 years, producing an average total annual return of 13.1% versus 11.1% for the S&P 500. Many investors that have turned to the private markets for passive real estate investments have averaged even greater returns. For instance, the real estate crowdfunding platform CrowdStreet has produced an average internal rate of return (IRR) of 18.5% for investors on its fully realized deals since 2014. Related: Real Estate Crowdfunding Returns Compared Buying and managing real estate is a business with incredible profit potential, but it’s important to realize that it’s a business and not a passive investment. The returns realized through owning real estate are a direct result of the time, energy and money that goes into it. While that business has been the source of many great fortunes over the years, it’s just simply not a business that makes sense for most people.

3/19/2022,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett, the 91-year-old Oracle of Investing, has seen just about every type of market. In 1999, at the height of the internet bubble, Buffett warned that investors expected unrealistic returns. In October 2008, the immediate aftermath of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, Buffett dismissed concerns about ""the long-term prosperity of the nation’s many sound companies."" In turn, Buffett has a phrase that captures exactly what the market is experiencing right now, says venture capitalist Adam Dell, the founder and CEO of a new investing platform called Domain Money. Despite ups and downs in the market, its prospects remain bullish in the long run, especially for tech and cryptocurrencies, Dell said. ""Market volatility is one of the things that is inherent in our market,"" says Dell, who spoke to Yahoo Finance on Jan. 25, well before the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. ""Whenever you have such a large inflow of capital into a discrete number of assets, you're going to have significant swings."" ""As Warren Buffett likes to say, 'The market is a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in the long term,"" adds Dell, the brother of Dell (DELL) CEO Michael Dell. The three major indexes have climbed in recent days since the Federal Reserve announced a 0.25% hike of its benchmark interest rate. But each has fallen at least 5% since the outset of this year, a rocky start to 2020 that has seen volatility befall markets amid persistent inflation and lingering COVID-19 disruptions. In early trading on Friday morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell slightly while the Nasdaq (^IXIC) ticked up. Since 1965, Buffett has built textile company Berkshire Hathaway into a giant holding company, along the way popularizing the strategy of “value investing,” which identifies stocks trading at a price lower than their book value, and patiently waits for them to rise. Late last month, Berkshire Hathaway reported almost $90 billion in profit over the course of 2021. In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett pointed to ""four giants"" that have driven the company's success: its insurance operations, BNSF, Berkshire Hathaway Energy and its stake in Apple. Dell, who departed Goldman Sachs last year after leading its online-only bank Marcus, echoed Buffett's signature long-term focus as he highlighted promising trends in tech and cryptocurrency. ""As I look at the long term trends, some of the free cash flow sources that are being spit out of some of the larger tech names, I'm quite bullish on their prospects going forward,"" he says. ""As it relates to cryptocurrencies, where we're focused, I look at the fundamental underlying components of blockchain technologies and their contribution to our financial markets,"" he adds.

3/19/2022,"Warren Buffett is right to be devouring shares of oil giant Occidental Petroleum (OXY), says one long-time oil markets strategist. The billionaire investor's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) scooped up another 18.1 million shares of Occidental for close to $1 billion this week. The latest purchases come hot on the heels of Berkshire spending $6 billion or so in the prior two weeks to buy up Occidental shares. Berkshire now owns nearly 14.6% of Occidental Petroleum through his roughly 140 million shares. Energy expert and portfolio manager Rob Thummel of Tortoise Capital says there is more behind Buffett's buying binge than a play on elevated oil prices. ""Occidental is benefiting from the higher oil prices. The other factor a lot of energy companies are doing that is changing the game for energy companies and how investors perceive them, is that Occidental has actually embraced the energy transition and participating in it,"" Thummel said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""You'll hear them talk a lot of about carbon capture. When you combine the energy security that Occidental can provide, plus the energy transition that they are participating in, that has become a more compelling story for energy investors going forward."" Thummel says he doesn't own any shares of Occidental. Occidental's stock price has responded as one would expect when a whale like Buffett gets involved. Shares have skyrocketed 43% in the past month compared to the relatively unchanged S&P 500, per Yahoo Finance Plus data. During that same span, shares of oil majors ExxonMobil and Chevron are up 1% and 19%, respectively. Occidental will hold a key investor day on March 22.

3/19/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- It took one of the biggest stock-market routs in Chinese history, but President Xi Jinping may finally be heeding the concerns of international investors. Most Read from Bloomberg Putin Likely to Make Nuclear Threats If War Drags, U.S. Says Biden Team Hardens View of China Tilting to Putin on Ukraine Shock Waves From War in Ukraine Threaten to Swamp Sri Lanka Ukraine Update: Russia Again Shells Western Areas Around Lviv Putin Vows to Rid Russia of ‘Traitors’ While Waging Ukraine War A sweeping set of promises this week from Xi’s government to make regulation more transparent and predictable -- as well as a commitment to overseas markets including Hong Kong -- suggests authorities are appealing to investors abroad. The ruling Communist Party is seeking to regain the trust of international funds and the global business community after the country was lumped in with Russia as an “uninvestable” destination. China has more overtly distanced itself from Russia over the past week, saying it wants to avoid being impacted by U.S. sanctions and promising to “never attack” Ukraine. Xi is set to speak with U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday morning in Washington for the first time since Russia’s invasion. Xi’s shift contrasts with the unbending strategy of his friend President Vladimir Putin, despite global sanctions decimating Russia’s economy. While China still needs to follow through with this week’s pledges, the rhetoric has helped reduce turmoil in the nation’s financial markets. A gauge of Chinese stocks in Hong Kong rebounded at the fastest pace since the 1998 Asian financial crisis. “The market was in freefall -- a clear signal was needed from a senior level to clear the air,” said Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California San Diego who researches elite Chinese politics. “I think unclear and even deleterious policy conditions were beginning to create an all-out panic.” In the latest potential shift, Xi pledged at a Politburo meeting to limit the economic impact of the country’s Covid-Zero policy, the first time he has done so during the pandemic. Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam on Thursday promised a review of Covid-fighting measures that have spurred a growing exodus from the business community. That came a month after Xi told local officials bringing the omicron outbreak under control was “a mission that overrides everything.” Among other notable developments this week, China’s securities watchdog is considering giving U.S. regulators access to company audits as soon as this year, people familiar with the matter said. This would be Beijing’s biggest concession since Chinese firms first listed in the U.S. more than two decades ago, and may help ease concern about forced delistings. The State Council said a crackdown on internet platform companies would be completed “as soon as possible.” Increased regulation helped wipe as much as $661 billion off Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s shares alone since their 2020 peak. The Finance Ministry said it won’t expand a property tax trial this year -- a plan that had been floated in October. China’s cabinet said it would resolve risks around property developers. A liquidity crisis for builders such as China Evergrande Group has weighed on the nation’s property, stock and credit markets for months. Previously, officials described the collapsing value of such firms as a market event which wouldn’t necessitate government intervention. Xi’s government had until now displayed little concern for the rout in Chinese markets. State-directed campaigns like “common prosperity” limited private sector-growth and dragged the MSCI China Index of stocks down 22% last year -- the biggest underperformance versus global shares since 1998. Investors in Chinese junk dollar bonds suffered their worst relative returns in more than a decade. But with Xi set to seek a third term as president in a twice-decade leadership reshuffle later this year, the Communist Party is prioritizing stability above all else. The need for the government to act had been growing more urgent. Global confidence in Chinese financial markets was by some metrics the weakest since the financial crisis in 2008, with stocks cratering, credit plunging and record outflows from government bonds undermining the currency’s strength. Hong Kong’s reputation as an international finance hub has been called into question, after two years of closed borders spurred at least tens of thousands of residents to abandon the city. China’s worst Covid outbreak since Wuhan and Putin’s invasion of Ukraine pose new and unpredictable threats to China’s already slowing economy. Authorities risk a downward spiral in their bursting of a property-market bubble, with the largest developers suffering a 43% year-on-year decline in home sales in the first two months. There’s still plenty that can go wrong for investors. China’s closeness with Russia puts it at the center of increasingly fraught geopolitical tensions. A potential overhaul of Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s payments business and Didi Global Inc.’s delayed Hong Kong listing shows regulators are unlikely to go soft on Big Tech. The central bank’s decision this week to refrain from cutting interest rates served as a reminder that monetary policy will remain prudent. Bulls got burned so many times in the past year that few are convinced the worst is finally over. Markets remain volatile, with the Hang Seng China gauge falling as much as 3.6% on Friday before recovering. Xi’s government has faced collapsing investor confidence before. Heavy-handed intervention in the domestic stock market in 2015 after a bubble burst drew criticism from global funds, who said officials were turning their backs on free-market reforms. A messy devaluation of the yuan the same year spurred capital outflows and raised questions over the competence of China’s oversight of financial markets. In 2018, the CSI 300 Index lost about a quarter of its value in a rout triggered by the Sino-U.S. trade war. Yet each time Xi’s government pushed ahead with plans to further open up China’s capital markets and attract foreign funds. The country’s domestic shares were added to MSCI indexes in 2018, and bonds included in global benchmarks from the following year. Soon, foreign investors couldn’t get enough. Between the start of 2019 and the end of 2021, overseas holdings of local stocks increased by more than 242% to 3.9 trillion yuan ($614 billion). Inflows into the nation’s bond market rose by 129% to 4.1 trillion yuan. Western capital and technology are essential to China, despite recent efforts to make the country more self-sufficient. Foreign direct investment topped 1 trillion yuan last year, with about a third going into high-tech sectors, Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said this month. The need to ensure global investors are on China’s side is unlikely to end any time soon. “China can not develop in isolation of the world and nor can the world develop without China,” Vice President Wang Qishan said in a speech at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in November. “China will keep its arms wide open, provide more market investment and growth opportunities to the world.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Broke Oligarch Says Sanctioned Billionaires Have No Sway Over Putin A Once Radical Idea to Close the Wealth Gap Is Actually Happening Russia’s Brain Drain Becomes a Stampede for the Exits U.S. Work-Permit Backlog Is Costing Immigrants Their Jobs The 18 Minutes of Trading Chaos That Broke the Nickel Market ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•17 hours ago,Global Exodus From Chinese Markets Prompts Xi to Change Tack,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-exodus-chinese-markets-prompts-074623911.html
3/19/2022,"Gas prices in the U.S. keep going up and up, and Washington's Democrats have found a convenient scapegoat for the pain inflicted on American drivers — Big Oil. President Joe Biden says oil companies “shouldn’t pad their profits” while crude oil prices fall. Meanwhile, Democrats are pushing for a windfall tax on oil profits, and industry CEOs may face a grilling in Congress next month. But halfway around the U.S., the Democratic governor of an important oil-producing state has a different message: Oil companies might have good reason to be wary of amping up production. “I have had several informal discussions and many of them tell me they're not planning on changing their plans. What they need for that is a couple of things,” Colorado Governor Jared Polis said in a new Yahoo Finance Presents interview. First, oil companies need long-term price stability. If a company moves now, it could lose out if prices drop before new oil actually starts flowing. It “could be in six months, it could be in a year,” Polis says of the lag each company has to factor in. The price of oil has indeed been highly volatile in recent years. When many Americans briefly drove less at the onset of the pandemic in 2020, the over-supply briefly turned oil prices negative. That shook up the industry and led to pullbacks on production we still feel today. Even this week, the price of crude oil collapsed and entered bear market territory days after record highs. Aside from price volatility, capital markets could be stopping oil companies from changing course. “There was a bubble of debt that drove oil and gas production a couple years ago and they’re still on the other side of the pendulum,” Polis says. Right now, he added, “They're not interested in debt finance and expansion.” A company like Exxon (XOM) surely remembers investing over the last decade and then posting a net annual loss of $22.4 billion for 2020, the largest in its history. The oil giant survived but many smaller companies failed. In a recent oil bankruptcy report, the Texas law firm Haynes and Boone documented more than 600 industry bankruptcies from 2015 through 2021. Oil companies have plenty of opportunity to drill — including in Colorado, Polis says. “It's not about permitting; it's about deployment of capital,” he says. Some Republican lawmakers, he warned, are “almost echoing Socialist Party lines saying we should order them to do it or make them do it, sort of a centralized command economy.” As of Friday, Americans pay $4.27 for a gallon of gas, near recent highs even as the price of crude oil fell. Colorado — the fifth highest producer of crude oil in the U.S. as of last November — is a bit below average with prices at $3.96 a gallon. Politicians across Washington are focusing on the high prices, blaming both “Putin’s price hike” and supposed oil company profiteering. One liberal group proclaimed the companies ""Price Gouge Consumers After Record-Smashing Year"" in a release on Friday. Oil prices are decreasing, gas prices should too. Last time oil was $96 a barrel, gas was $3.62 a gallon. Now it’s $4.31.  Oil and gas companies shouldn’t pad their profits at the expense of hardworking Americans. pic.twitter.com/uLNGleWBly — President Biden (@POTUS) March 16, 2022 For his part, in lieu of trying to pressure oil companies, Polis has handled inflation differently and focused on measures to alleviate prices for his constituents such as cutting government taxes and fees. He favors suspending the federal gas tax, which would knock off 18.4 cents a gallon on gas prices; he aims to provide his constituents with additional relief by cutting state gas taxes. Beyond that, it might be a waiting game. “Look, if prices stay where they are now, there's no question domestic production will step up. But I think what a lot of producers want to see is, 'Is this just a spike in the market?' or 'Is this something that we can count on by the time we get rigs in the ground?'” Polis says.

3/19/2022,"Given all that’s happened recently, some people are talking about a recession. What’s that? It’s technically when there are two consecutive quarters (or more) of negative gross domestic product growth. Basically, it’s when the economic engine slows down. Since 1980, we’ve had six recessions. We aren’t there yet. But if we do get there, don’t fret too much. In five of the last six recessions, the S&P 500 was up a year later. Plus, it’s possible to succeed in almost all market conditions. I don’t mean there are ways where it’s impossible to lose. Rather, there are some stocks that seem to do quite well in recessions. These kinds of stocks are “durable” – they’re well-established names and tend to pay dividends. Let me show you what I mean. Focusing on quality is paramount when markets are under pressure. Using my firm MAPsignals’ database, I’ve filtered for various quality metrics and a history of Big Money investment to identify five stocks that tend to do well in harder economic times: WMT, ABT, JNJ, GIS, & HSY. Up first is Walmart Inc. (WMT), the discount retail giant. Even though great stocks can be choppy, like WMT over the past year, these companies are worthy of attention, especially when they have a tech-oriented growth strategy and huge hiring plans. Check out WMT: 1-month performance (+8.5%) Historical Big Money signals Just to show you what our Big Money signal looks like, have a look at the top buy signals WMT has made over the years in the chart below. Blue bars are showing it was likely being bought by a Big Money player according to MAPsignals. When you see a lot of them, I call it the stairway to heaven: Source: www.MAPsignals.com But, what about fundamentals? As you can see, WMT’s sales and earnings growth rates have held strong, and its earnings growth estimate is appealing: 3-year sales growth rate (+3.7%) 3-year EPS growth rate (+41.0%) 2-year vs. 1-year EPS growth rate estimate (+7.6%) What about WMT in a downturn? Over the last six recessions, its average return is an astounding (+34.4%). Next up is Abbott Laboratories (ABT), the enormous health care company. Check out these technicals for ABT: 1-month performance (-3.4%) Historical Big Money signals Let’s look long-term. These are the top buy signals Abbott has made since 1990. The Big Money love is clear: Source: www.MAPsignals.com Now let’s dive deeper. As you can see, Abbott has had rock-solid sales and earnings growth: 1-year sales growth rate (+24.5%) 3-year EPS growth rate (+44.6%) In the past six recessions, Abbott averaged a (+9.8%) gain. Even better, a year later, its average return was (+13.6%). This stock has handled downturns well in the past. The third growth stock idea is Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), another enormous health care company. Strong stocks usually have Big Money buying the shares. J&J has that. While JNJ has been choppy, it hasn’t fluctuated a lot over the past year. And it’s nice to see the stock has risen recently: 1-month performance (+4.4%) Historical Big Money signals Below are the Big Money signals J&J has made since 1990. That’s the JUICE! Source: www.MAPsignals.com Now let’s look under the hood. J&J’s sales and earnings growth is impressive. Its profitability is strong too and so is its current 2.4% dividend, which help in a recession: 1-year sales growth rate (+13.5%) 3-year EPS growth rate (+13.3%) Profit margin (+22.3%) In the last six recessions, J&J stock rose fives times. Its average return over those recessions is (+12.3%), so it’s a downturn winner for sure. Number four on the list is General Mills, Inc. (GIS), which is a huge food and beverage company with several well-known brand names. Here are the technicals important to me: 1-month performance (-6.2%) Historical Big Money signals Below are the Big Money signals for GIS since 1990. While it’s waned a bit recently, the Big Money has liked General Mills for a long time: Source: www.MAPsignals.com Let’s examine a bit more. General Mills has been growing sales well, is poised to grow earnings, and owns a nice profit margin: 3-year sales growth rate (+4.8%) 2-year vs. 1-year EPS growth estimate (+4.3%) Profit margin (+12.9%) Regardless of the economy, people need food. That has certainly helped GIS in the past six recessions, when it gained in five of them. Its average return over that span is (+15.3%), and it grew more one year and two years later (+14.5% and +28.7%, respectively). Our last recession stock is an easy one to understand, it’s The Hershey Company (HSY), which makes candy and snacks seemingly everybody loves. Check out these technicals: 1-month performance (+1.5%) Historical Big Money signals Hershey has made the MAPsignals Top 20 report many times since 1990: Source: www.MAPsignals.com Now let’s look under the hood. Hershey has been growing sales and earnings, and its profit margin is strong: 1-year sales growth rate (+10.1%) 3-year EPS growth rate (+8.7%) Profit margin (+16.5%) Does candy melt in a recession? No. In the last six recessions, Hershey has gained four times, with an overall average return of (+8.7%). WMT, ABT, JNJ, GIS, & HSY represent top stocks to buy in a recession. Strong fundamentals and historical Big Money buy signals make these stocks worthy of extra attention in tough economic times.

3/19/2022,"By Chris Prentice WASHINGTON (Reuters) - You may not have heard of Joshua Mitts, a young Columbia University professor who is making some powerful enemies on Wall Street. The 36-year-old securities law specialist has become an increasingly influential figure in the hot debate over activist short selling since publishing a 2018 analysis of trading data that suggested some players were manipulating the market. Interviews with 12 people familiar with his work and career, including Mitts himself and some of his toughest critics, shed light on how an academic little known outside his field just a few years ago has since taken center stage in the ugly feud between short sellers and the companies they target. That struggle has sparked a sprawling probe by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into suspected trading manipulation by short sellers and hedge funds. Activist short sellers like Muddy Waters' Carson Block bet against public companies they deem over-valued and then publish their investment thesis. They say their work aids market efficiency and dispute Mitts' analysis as flawed. Nonetheless the interviews, which detail Mitts' contacts with U.S. authorities, show the professor and his work have played a significant role in the federal probes. ""One reason the work really resonated was it took a large sample and showed there was evidence for what companies were saying: that there was potential abuse,"" said Peter Molk, a law professor at the University of Florida. Mitts declined to comment on his work for the Justice Department beyond pointing to a statement on his resume that he has ""extensive experience supporting"" the agency. He defended his research and said he wanted to be objective and is not opposed to short selling. ""Not only is short selling not illegal, it's important to have bears,"" he said. Spokespeople for the Justice Department and the SEC, the main stock market regulator, declined to comment. Mitts' journey began in August 2018 when he reached out to real-estate company Farmland Partners Inc, which was grappling with a steep fall in its shares after an anonymous online post raised questions about its solvency. Weeks earlier, he had published his analysis of 1,720 pseudonymous posts attacking publicly listed stocks on financial website Seeking Alpha between 2010 and 2017. His study found such posts were preceded by unusual and suspicious trading through stock options, in a process he called ""short and distort"". Prior to 2018, the battle between U.S. companies and their detractors focused largely on the merits of short sellers and the veracity of their claims. Mitts' work gave companies new ammunition: they could use data to point to potentially manipulative trading tricks and allege fraud. 'ON A SILVER PLATTER' Mitts spoke with Farmland executives about his work and Farmland then retained him as an expert in late August 2018, the company said. Mitts' analysis showed investors bought put options https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-shorts-insight-idINKCN1R20AW with a short expiration window ahead of a Seeking Alpha posting. They became profitable once Farmland's shares began to tumble, and subsequently ginned up additional selling interest. Put options are derivative contracts that give holders the right to sell the underlying stock at a set price. Short-selling graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2HyuFCE In early September, Farmland CEO Paul Pittman and the company's attorneys took the professor to meet with officials at the SEC's Denver office, where they rebutted the short seller's claims and laid out the short and distort arguments. Pittman and the attorneys subsequently met officials at the Justice Department in October, without Mitts, and again laid out their rebuttal and manipulation theories, Farmland said. ""This is not about shorting. This is about securities fraud,"" CEO Pittman told Reuters. Elisabeth de Fontenay, a law professor at Duke University, said scrutinizing such types of trading patterns would have been a no-brainer for U.S. prosecutors. ""Josh Mitts handed them some potential indicators of fraud on a silver platter. Once they get handed that, they are going to look into it,"" she said. Mitts had more corporate callers. After Farmland, several other companies trying to repel short sellers hired him to consult, including Banc of California Inc, Burford Capital Ltd and Neovasc Inc, according to court and regulatory filings. Banc of California and Neovasc did not respond to requests for comment. Burford Capital did not provide a comment for this story. In 2019, Mitts began working as a consultant for the Justice Department, according to one source familiar with the matter who declined to be named because such work is sensitive. SHORT SELLERS HIT BACK Reuters and other media outlets have reported that the Justice Department had launched an expansive criminal investigation into the relationships among hedge funds and firms that publish negative reports on certain companies, often with the aim of sending the stock lower. The department has issued subpoenas to dozens of companies, which included requests for funds' trading records, according to the reports, bringing the issue of short selling to the forefront of market attention. The debate over the practice has long raged, with activist short sellers saying they act as whistleblowers rooting out fraud or other corporate misconduct, and critics saying they often spread false or misleading information. Spreading false information with the intent to move a stock price could constitute market manipulation, but U.S. free speech protections mean the bar for bringing such cases is high. Mitts said the aim of his research is simply to shed more light on short selling. ""My goal is to better understand how short reports affect the markets. I appreciate when industry participants take the time to engage with academics on these important questions."" Yet his critics are angry, including big-name investors Block of Muddy Waters and Citron Research's Andrew Left, both of whom are being scrutinized as part of the Justice Department probe, according to the media reports. Left said Mitts' analysis was fundamentally flawed because it did not account for all the potential reasons behind trading patterns that may appear to be suspicious, describing the study as ""sloppy"". Block, who made his name outing fraud at Chinese companies, first learned about Mitts in January 2019 when the law professor was quoted in a news report about regulators looking into aggressive short sellers, a source with direct knowledge of the situation said. Initial interactions between the two men were friendly. Block attended Mitts' class at Columbia in early 2019. That April, during a public panel discussion featuring the two men, Mitts told the moderator that he thought ""Carson's a good American."" But the relationship has soured. Last month, Block published a paper, ""Distorting the Shorts,"" refuting Mitts' paper, in which he said the academic's work consulting for companies was a conflict of interest. Mitts told Reuters he stopped consulting work for targets of activist short sellers in April 2020. Block also argued that Mitts' analysis was misleading as the authors of the majority of posts Mitts reviewed were not actually short the stock concerned, according to disclosures required by Seeking Alpha. Trading patterns Mitts cites as key evidence of manipulation may be accounted for by corporate earnings reports rather than short reports, the paper said. ""Mitts' 'Short and Distort' badly misrepresents the underlying data,"" it added. Mitts declined to comment on Block's paper.
