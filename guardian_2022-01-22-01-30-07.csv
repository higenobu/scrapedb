1/22/2022,"It was a month after the Manchester Arena attack when Martin Hibbert learned the catastrophic toll of his injuries. He and his 14-year-old daughter, Eve, on a “daddy daughter day” to an Ariana Grande concert, were 5 metres from the explosion that killed 22 people and injured hundreds more in May 2017. Hibbert, 45, from Chorley in Lancashire, was told he would never walk again. Eve would probably never see, hear, speak or move – if she made it out of hospital. They were the closest to the bomb to survive.  Nearly five years on, Hibbert describes every day as “like climbing a mountain” as they continue to recover from their injuries. He is, however, preparing to tackle his biggest peak yet: in June, he will attempt to scale Mount Kilimanjaro to raise £1m for charity to support people with debilitating spinal injuries. “The climb is to say: don’t write me off because I’m in a wheelchair. Look at what someone in a wheelchair can do with the right help and support,” he said. Hibbert, a football agent, will tackle the 45-mile ascent on a custom-made handbike, using push-and-pull levers to navigate the often harsh terrain on Africa’s highest mountain. It will take about a week of gruelling 12- to 14-hour climbs to reach the summit of Kilimanjaro, where temperatures can fall as low as -20C. If he succeeds, it is believed he will be one of the first people to reach the top with a complete spinal cord injury. The risks are considerable. About one in three people who attempt Kilimanjaro never make it to the summit, according to mountaineering websites, and he estimates there is a 10% success rate for those in wheelchairs. One of the greatest risks is infection, given the length of time he will be in a specially adapted chair, so a skin nurse will be among the medics guiding him to the top. “The odds are against me but the paramedic that saved my life didn’t think I was going to survive the journey to hospital,” he said. “Failure is just not an option.” Since the blast, Hibbert has become an ambassador for the Spinal Injuries Association and a motivational speaker. Far from blocking out the arena atrocity, he uses it to help counter his depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. “There are times when it does get tough and I don’t want to get out of bed and you’ve got to find the strength,” he said. “I just use Salman Abedi or [the thought that] if I don’t get out of bed today, the terrorists have won. They don’t want me sat here with you today during this interview. They don’t want me living life to the full. They want me sat in the corner crying about it.” He added: “If you could see what I’ve seen, it would finish you off. To see all those people around us dead and blown up – but we’ve survived. That’s what gets me out of bed, because if I don’t live life to the full I’m letting those 22 people down and their families.” Hibbert has already raised almost £400,000 of his £1m target for the Spinal Injuries Association. His greater goal, he said, was for a “revolution” in how Britain thought about disabled people. He said he had been shocked by the lack of assistance for those in wheelchairs, for instance in hotels, restaurants or cinemas – and was appalled to learn that only one-third of the roughly 2,500 people a year who sustained a spinal cord injury sought specialist support to help them regain their independence. “When you’re disabled I think members of the public either think you’re a Paralympic athlete or a benefits scrounger. There’s nothing in between,” he said. “It’s not the spinal cord injury or the wheelchair that makes me feel disabled, it’s people’s attitudes, it’s the landscape, it’s the environment.” Hibbert, a lifelong Manchester United fan, said he had been inspired by the footballer Marcus Rashford’s successful campaign for free school meals and that he would lobby the government on behalf of people with life-changing injuries: “This is about changing the landscape for disabled people. If all we do is raise a million quid, I’ll be disappointed. I’ll see it as a failure.” When he reaches the summit Hibbert will scatter the ashes of his mother, who died in October and was “incredibly proud” if not overly enthusiastic about his Kilimanjaro attempt. He will also carry a picture of “my princess” Eve, now 19, whose recovery has astounded the medics who treated her for 10 months at Manchester children’s hospital. Despite the early prognosis, she can see, hear, talk and has begun to walk unaided: “I keep saying to her: when she is ready, she will inspire the world.”",News/UK news,‘Don’t write me off because I’m in a wheelchair’: Manchester Arena survivor takes on Kilimanjaro,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/21/manchester-arena-bomb-attack-survivor-martin-hibbert-kilimanjaro

1/22/2022,"The man convicted of killing the children’s author Helen Bailey in 2016 appeared calm following the death of his wife and there were no signs he had tried to revive her, a paramedic has told a court. Ian Stewart, 61, is on trial accused of the murder of Diane Stewart, 47, at their home in Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire, in 2010.  Spencer North, a paramedic who attended the scene on 25 June that year, said he was let through the gate by Stewart and found Diane in cardiac arrest in the couple’s back garden. North said there were none of the usual signs of panic from Stewart at such a scene and no evidence that he had tried to perform CPR on his wife. “From my professional experience, when you go to a death of a loved one or a family member [people] typically show a heightened emotional state, screaming, crying, upset,” said North, adding: “In this particular case he appeared dissociative and was simply answering questions calmly.” He told jurors at Huntingdon crown court that Stewart appeared “initially distracted, idly pacing”. Asked by the prosecutor, Stuart Trimmer QC, how Stewart appeared “emotionally”, North replied that he “didn’t seem particularly distressed or anxious at all”. North said Stewart told him his wife suffered from epilepsy and that he had found her unresponsive when he arrived back home. The paramedic said there “didn’t seem to be any effective CPR but we were told when he came out of the gate that he was just doing CPR”. He said: “Generally effective CPR causes trauma. You crush the ribs, they pop, they snap, the airway is normally open. Not everyone knows how to do it but that’s what you normally see if effective CPR is commenced.” The paramedic said he saw none of this. North said he saw “blood-stained saliva” on Diane Stewart’s mouth. “If there had been effective mouth-to-mouth, what would you expect to see?” asked Trimmer. “That would have been everywhere,” North said. He said there were “no obvious injuries” to Stewart. An ambulance service form completed at the scene gave the call time as 11.24am. The ambulance was on scene at 11.41am and death was pronounced at 12.02pm. PC Matt Gardner said he attended and completed a coroner’s report form as he did not assess the death to be suspicious. Asked how Stewart was when he was with him, he said: “He answered my questions clearly, I wouldn’t say distressed, distraught, but people act very differently under such circumstances.” He agreed that he ascertained that Stewart was the last person to see his wife alive, recording that time as 10.30am on 25 June. Stewart denies the murder of his wife.

1/22/2022,"Rishi Sunak is renowned at Westminster for burnishing his brand in preparation to make a bid for the top job – but it now appears he may get the opportunity much sooner than expected. If he does succeed Boris Johnson in No 10, he will be one of the wealthiest prime ministers in history. And if it happens before his 42nd birthday, in mid-May, he’ll be the youngest in 150 years. Well-tailored and whip-smart, the chancellor has been assiduously wooing Conservative MPs, and polls suggest he is well-liked by the public – or certainly more so than his beleaguered boss. An Ipsos Mori poll taken in the past few days gave Sunak a net favourability rating of +7, against Johnson’s -39, and -14 for the Labour leader, Keir Starmer.  But with a cost of living crisis looming, some at Westminster are questioning whether Sunak’s political worldview is the right one for this moment – and asking if he is “streetwise” enough to make the move next door. The son of Punjabi immigrants from east Africa, Sunak studied at Winchester public school before graduating from Oxford in philosophy, politics and economics. While his classmates were partying, the nerdy Sunak became president of the Oxford Investment Club and he went on to pursue a career in the City, breaking off to take an MBA at Stanford in the US, where he met his wife, Akshata Murthy. They certainly wouldn’t need to raise funds for wallpaper. Murthy owns a 0.91% stake in Infosys, the Indian tech giant founded by her father, according to its annual report. The chancellor’s own investments from his days as a hedge fund manager are tucked away in a blind trust – but Murthy’s share of the family firm alone is worth more than £700m at current prices, and the pair own a string of properties, including a substantial Georgian house in his North Yorkshire constituency. The richest ever prime minister, according to Guinness World Records, was Edward Stanley the 14th Earl of Derby (1799-1869), with the equivalent of about £444m today. And there was Lord Rosebery (1847-1929), a hereditary peer with an ancestral castle who married Hannah de Rothschild, heir to a banking fortune. Sunak and his wife were granted planning permission last year to build a swimming pool, gym and steam room in their paddock. In 2020, he posed for pre-budget photos with a £180 coffee mug. He was already a junior minister under Theresa May, but it was fellow Brexiter Boris Johnson who gave him the plum role of chief secretary to the Treasury just four years after he was first elected to represent leafy Richmond. Sunak came out early for Johnson, penning a joint op-ed with two other young MPs, Robert Jenrick and Oliver Dowden. “The Tories are in deep peril. Only Boris Johnson can save us,” they warned melodramatically in a Times article coordinated by Johnson’s campaign team. All three men went on to be cabinet ministers under Johnson – though Jenrick was unceremoniously sacked in last autumn’s reshuffle. Sunak’s peers say his time at Stanford, in the California sunshine, was key to informing his politics, as well as his penchant for hoodies and sliders. “He thinks of himself as a tech bro. He kind of believes it, it’s infected him,” said one person who has worked with him. That makes Sunak, as well as an evangelist for innovation and a fan of low taxes, sceptical of how much good the government can do by meddling in the economy. Sunak is also firmly committed to balancing the books – both because he believes in it economically, and because he thinks it’s a crucial political dividing line with Labour. The latter informed decisions such as insisting on an increase in national insurance contributions (NICs) to fund the NHS and social care; cutting the aid budget, and reversing the £20-a-week rise in universal credit that helped some of the UK’s poorest families through the pandemic. Perhaps ironically, the decision Sunak is best known for – the furlough scheme, which paid millions of people’s wages during the crisis – is one that cuts against his political instincts. He embraced the need for a big, generous scheme to protect jobs in the extraordinary conditions of the pandemic, when the government was literally ordering businesses to close, but was keen to turn the spending taps off again as soon as possible. In November 2020 he was forced into a last-minute U-turn, extending furlough just hours before it was due to come to an end, as the Treasury belatedly realised that abruptly withdrawing support as Covid cases rose once again could be disastrous. Today, with inflation rocketing and fuel bills set to jump in April, Sunak’s national insurance rise is deeply contentious. His likely leadership rival Liz Truss let it be known that she had challenged it in cabinet at the time, and the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has called for it to be cancelled. That’s one reason some colleagues are sceptical about Sunak’s low tax, small state politics, particularly given the Tories’ new electoral coalition, which since 2019 runs through a swath of former Labour seats where voters have been promised “levelling up”. “We’ve got an entirely new voter base in an entirely new part of the country. Cutting spending to reduce the deficit isn’t going to do it for them; it’s not 2010,” said one Tory aide, adding: “The voters of Bolton North East didn’t rush to the polling station holding a copy of Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations.” That concern was echoed by a frontbencher who attended one of Sunak’s recent meetings with MPs on the cost of living crisis – which turned out to be a thinly veiled leadership pitch. “Rishi wants to be like Nigel Lawson, but he [Lawson] set out a theoretical, foundational understanding of where the country was and where he could take it. He was the leader of political thought at the time, coming out of a time when we were over-regulated, where the state was too big. “Modern politics is not in the same place, it doesn’t matter whether Rishi thinks it should be or even if I think it should be. Boris is actually closer to where the public is. But the Treasury has somehow convinced itself that what the party wants is hairshirt fiscal austerity. It’s bollocks, utter bollocks.” One economist said Sunak was “a lot like Philip Hammond, just with a bit more charisma”. His defenders say there’s reason for his fiscal caution: he believes he was only able to spend an extraordinary £400bn on cushioning the economic impact of Covid because of the fiscal repair work done by his predecessors. “He very much believes if it wasn’t for the decisions made by Hammond and [George] Osborne before him, he wouldn’t have been able to act in that way,” says an aide. They also claim the clamour for state intervention on issues such as energy price rises is conditioned by the unprecedented support put in place during the pandemic. “Covid broke maths,” the aide says, suggesting it is Sunak’s job now to inject some realism. And they point to the fact he was already warning about inflation and its potential impact on the public finances in December 2020, before it was widely seen as a looming problem. The chancellor’s scepticism about the government’s net zero targets, or at least the state’s role in achieving them, also concerns some colleagues – though it warms the hearts of those Tory backbenchers who fear the consequences of green policies for their constituents’ pockets. Treasury insiders describe Sunak with respect rather than warmth. They appreciate his undeniable intellectual ability, decisiveness and dedication to hard work – but some say his smooth veneer is hard to penetrate. One official who has worked closely with the chancellor describes many of his relationships as “transactional”. “All his interactions with you are about: he wants something, can he get it? And then it’s over. There’s very little forming a human relationship or bond with anyone.” Colleagues also say they have always been conscious of Sunak’s intense ambition. He was unexpectedly made chancellor when Sajid Javid resigned rather than accept a plan hatched by Dominic Cummings to sack Javid’s advisers and set up a new joint team handpicked by No 10. At the time, Sunak was derided as “chino” – chancellor in name only – for accepting the bargain, but insiders say with Cummings out, the Treasury effectively took control of the team, leaving No 10 with little economics expertise of its own. “No 10 is just so chaotic, the Treasury spends a lot of time managing the chaos,” said one Whitehall-watcher. As well as savvy economic advisers, Sunak employs Cass Horowitz – co-founder of a creative agency called The Clerkenwell Brothers – to manage his personal brand, which is carefully honed with slick social media posts and branded hoodies. Treasury old-timers looked on with something approaching horror in the summer of 2020 when posters advertising the “eat out to help out” scheme were plastered across cafes and restaurants up and down the country, featuring a prominent facsimile of Sunak’s signature. Research later suggested the £850m scheme had contributed to one-sixth of Covid clusters over that summer, though the Treasury rejects the claim. Sunak’s Labour opposite number, Rachel Reeves, has repeatedly pointed to his tendency to disappear, rather than face difficult questions. That was a tactic pioneered by May, who was dubbed “submarine May” when she was in David Cameron’s cabinet. It served her well in emerging unscathed from six years as home secretary – but perhaps masked her shortcomings as a campaigner. A Labour source pointed out that Sunak tends to be prickly and irritable when attacked by Reeves across the dispatch box. “You can see it in his face: he hates it.” Colleagues on his own side of the House of Commons also fret about whether he has the political battle-scars to succeed in the top job. One former cabinet minister pointed to Sunak abruptly ending a TV interview when he was repeatedly asked about his support for Johnson. “The interview he gave this week where he walked out as he was asked for his support was deranged. And actually you know, it’s made people think – is he a bit green? He has not had a long time in politics actually, he’s been thrust into this huge position at a time of complete chaos but is he streetwise?”",News/Politics,Rishi Sunak: the polished ‘tech bro’ with low-tax dreams,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/21/rishi-sunak-the-polished-tech-bro-with-low-tax-dreams

1/22/2022,"Watford and Norwich City may be near the bottom of the Premier League, but both of these clubs can claim to be on a run of form. Whether that means they’re at the start of one, or in the middle, or coming towards the end, is a moot point, given that Norwich’s current sequence is one win in a row, while Watford are on a one-draw tear-up. OK, as form goes, neither trend is quite as hot as Manchester City’s 12 league victories on the bounce, or Fulham’s 19-goals-in-three-games scoring spree, but you have to make the best of things and enjoy life while the going is good. It’s later than you think.  Whichever way you spin it, Watford and Norwich are both currently in a better frame of mind than fellow relegation strugglers Newcastle, pegged back late last weekend by the Hornets, and Burnley, who haven’t won or indeed played a game since the days of Bob Lord. Newcastle have gone backwards since the dismissal of Steve Bruce, currently basking in the lukewarm glow of borderline vindication, and face a difficult test at re-energised Leeds on Saturday. Burnley meanwhile have a Sunday showdown with a wounded Arsenal team looking to bounce back from their Worthington Cup no-show against Liverpool. A chance, then, for Watford or Norwich to build a small cushion o’comfort by claiming all six points that are sort of on offer when they meet at Vicarage Road on Friday night. Watford and Claudio Ranieri both have reasons for feeling bullish. The Hornets have won their last five league matches against Norwich, and while Ranieri wasn’t in situ for any of them, he’s been winning his own battles with the Canaries, with three wins and a draw from his four career meetings. On the other hand, Watford are the only team in the top four divisions without a clean sheet, while Norwich, who had previously gone six matches without scoring, rediscovered the art last weekend while getting Rafa Benítez the sack, a performance that, depending on your point of view, either condemns Everton to the relegation battle, or saves them from it.

1/22/2022,"The veteran TV presenter David Dimbleby has suggested the BBC licence fee could be linked to council tax to make it fairer as the government questions future funding of the broadcaster. Dimbleby, who presented Question Time on the BBC for 25 years, said: “The licence fee is something that I absolutely believe in. I don’t think you can have public service broadcasting without paying for it through the public purse in that way.  “But what I do think is the BBC should acknowledge that £159 paid by the poorest as well the richest is just unfair, it’s inequitable,” he told BBC Radio 4’s World at One. “And there’s a simple way in which the BBC can get on the front foot, which is by suggesting the licence fee figure, the gross figure of £159, should not be paid flat rate by everybody but the richest should pay more and the poorest less. And the simple way of doing it would be to attach an element of the licence fee to the council tax band.” Asked if this could mean a sharp price rise for wealthier users, he replied: “Some people might pay double, some people might pay half.” He added: “Why should the poorest pay the same as I pay? It’s just not fair.” The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, announced on Monday the annual fee paid by households would be fixed at £159 until April 2024, before rising with inflation for the following four years. A number of alternatives to funding for the licence fee have been floated, including an opt-in subscription service similar to that used by streaming giants such as Netflix, the introduction of advertising, or a broadband levy. The BBC has criticised the two-year freeze, arguing it will lead to “tougher choices” that will affect viewers. Bosses at the corporation have branded the move “disappointing” as Dorries even came under criticism from her own side while arguing it was necessary to tackle the rising cost of living. Labour has accused the cabinet minister of trying to distract from Boris Johnson’s woes while waging a “vendetta” against the broadcaster. Asked that if cuts were needed, what should be cut, Dimbleby said: “If you stick with everything you’ve got and you have less money, then inevitably the quality deteriorates. So maybe you do have to make cuts and I don’t know where they would lie. Maybe you have to have some services that are subscription, some specialised services.” Dimbleby also said the BBC must do more to keep in “lockstep” with public opinion, saying it has strayed “a bit”, such as on issues as immigration. “Over the years the BBC has not been strong on looking at the reasons that people in some parts of Britain were uneasy about the scale of immigration,” he said.",News/Media,David Dimbleby suggests BBC licence fee could be linked to council tax,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/21/david-dimbleby-suggests-bbc-licence-fee-could-be-linked-to-council-tax
1/22/2022,"Summon up an image of Charles Dickens, and his luxuriant “doorknocker” beard will be one of the first things to come to mind. But an “extremely rare” portrait of the author, depicting the “glorious” moustache he sported for few years only, is set to show his more dapper side. Dickens is thought to have first experimented with a moustache in 1844, and seems to have been immensely pleased with the new look. “The moustaches are glorious, glorious. I have cut them shorter, and trimmed them a little at the ends to improve their shape,” he wrote to his friend, the artist Daniel Maclise. “They are charming, charming. Without them, life would be a blank.”  Later, on discovering that his brother Fred had also become moustachioed, Dickens wrote to his wife, Catherine: “He has a moustache … I feel (as the Stage Villains say) that either he or I must fall. Earth will not hold us both.” A sharp, detailed daguerreotype profile portrait of Dickens sporting his moustache was made in around 1852-55, when he was writing Bleak House and Hard Times. It was donated to the Charles Dickens Museum in London by a private collector last year, and the museum has put it on display for the first time, until 31 March, limiting the time it is shown to ensure its conservation. The image had previously been in the private collection for 20 years, after it was rediscovered in the collection of a reclusive Irish photography enthusiast, Charles Cloney. Emily Smith, the museum’s curator, said the portrait was “extremely rare”. “A moustachioed Dickens is hard to find,” she said. “While his bearded visage in instantly recognisable, Dickens’s early experiments with face furniture are far less well recorded and evidence is scarce. Dickens was image-conscious, definitely a dandy; his public image was carefully crafted and presented and portrait sittings, though not always enjoyed, were not taken lightly.” Not everyone was impressed by the author’s new look, however. According to British Library curator Andrea Lloyd, Dickens’s friend John Forster described the moustache as a “hideous disfigurement”, and delayed a portrait of the author that he had commissioned because of it. The moustache, however, developed: by 1853, Dickens had added a “Newgate Fringe”, or hair under the chin. Travelling in Italy with Wilkie Collins, author of The Woman in White and The Moonstone, the pair entered a facial hair-growing competition. Dickens wrote to his wife Catherine: “You remember how the corners of his mouth go down, and how he looks through his spectacles and manages his legs. I don’t know how it is, but the moustache is a horrible aggravation of all this. He smooths it down over his mouth, in imitation of the present great Original.” By 1858, it had mushroomed into the full beard he is known for today – something which friends feared aged Dickens. But the author said it “saved him the trouble of shaving, and much as he admired his own appearance before he allowed his beard to grow, he admired it much more now, and never neglected, when an opportunity offered, to gaze his fill at himself”. The Charles Dickens Museum’s daguerreotype was made by John Jabez Edwin Mayall at his 224 Regent Street studio. His technique involved covering the centre of the image with “blackened zinc” before exposing the whole image to light, which wiped out all details except for those protected by the zinc. “The technique produced highly detailed images,” said the Charles Dickens Museum, which is at 48 Doughty Street, Dickens’s only surviving London house. “In the Mayall portrait, Dickens’s tousled hair, broad moustache and the individual lines around his eyes and mouth and on his forehead are vividly reproduced.” Writing to his friend, philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts, in 1852, Dickens spoke of how he had sat for a portrait with Mayall, saying that “I am disposed to think the portrait, by far the best specimen of anything that way, I have ever seen.”",Arts/Books,Rare photo of Charles Dickens sporting ‘glorious’ moustache goes on show,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/21/rare-photo-of-charles-dickens-sporting-glorious-moustache-goes-on-show
1/22/2022,"Congressman Henry Cuellar of Texas has had his home and campaign office raided this week as apart of a federal investigation into Azerbaijan and US businessmen who may have ties to the country, according to senior officials. On Wednesday, the FBI searched Cuellar’s property, in what it described as “court-authorized law enforcement activity”. Witnesses said at least a dozen federal agents moved through Cuellar’s home and office, carrying out various items and cases, as first reported by the Monitor of McAllen, Texas.  An FBI spokesperson, Rosanne Hughes, acknowledged the search in a statement on Wednesday night, though Cuellar was not named and few details on the wider investigation were offered. “The FBI was present in the vicinity of Windridge Drive and Estate Drive in Laredo conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity,” Hughes said. “The FBI cannot provide further comment on an ongoing investigation.” During the search, Cuellar’s office also released a short statement. “Congressman Cuellar will fully cooperate in any investigation. He is committed to ensuring that justice and the law are upheld,” read the statement. Cuellar, a moderate Democrat, has served in the House of Representatives since 2004, representing a district in Texas that extends from the US border with Mexico up to the eastern outskirts of San Antonio. Cuellar also has a seat on the House appropriations committee.",News/US news,FBI searches home of Texas Democrat in Azerbaijan investigation,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/21/henry-cuellar-fbi-searches-home-texas-democrat-azerbaijan
1/22/2022,"Rory McIlroy’s self-analysis said it all. “I have absolutely no idea,” replied the world No 8 when asked about the state of his game following a second-round 75 at the Abu Dhabi Championship. A converted birdie putt at the 18th should, barring something extraordinary from those due to finish round two on Saturday morning, be enough to afford him another 36 holes to assess. This was a curiously brutal desert day. Winds whipped consistently at 20mph and gusted at close to double that. The challenge was not at all what McIlroy and friends had in mind when opting to begin their competitive year at Yas Links. The scene was far from everyone’s cup of tea. “An absolute joke. Ridiculous,” barked Colin Montgomerie as he marched towards his penultimate tee. Either Monty was railing against course condition or a sand ant had moved at an inappropriate moment as he played the previous hole.  McIlroy was more pragmatic – the course at no point appeared unplayable – but acknowledged a weird afternoon at the office. “It’s different,” McIlroy said. “I can’t remember when it’s been like this here. I played in a couple of sandstorms in Dubai and a couple of mornings it’s been cold in Abu Dhabi but nothing like this. “I have played as thought-free as possible and played the conditions with the shots that I needed to play. I thought I drove it all right. A couple of iron shots got away from me but apart from that, I didn’t feel like I did all that badly. I think my sort of lost shots have been around the greens mostly the last couple days.” At plus three, McIlroy is 10 shots from the lead held by Scott Jamieson, who added a 74 to day one’s stunning 63. “It’s windier than Scotland,” smiled the Glaswegian. “It was cold today, as well. This isn’t what I expected. I knew it was going to be windy but thought it would still be short sleeves. “It’s a great test from tee to green, if you want to call it a test, at the mercy of whatever gust you might or might not get. You play for some wind sometimes and don’t get it, and when your ball defies gravity and goes up slopes at times. I am pretty happy with two over par today.” Viktor Hovland, Ian Poulter and James Morrison have Jamieson in their sights from six under. Morrison is among those with an incomplete second round, having reached the 15th tee when darkness halted proceedings. It was no shock to watch Poulter relishing his battle with the elements. “You don’t get to play in this kind of wind very often, especially when you’ve had nine weeks off and it’s never going to be this windy in the off-season, so you don’t really go and practise in it,” he said. “To get this thrown at you early in the season is tricky. “It’s been a while since you’ve had to hit those type of shots. In a way, it’s actually quite nice. We’ve played them in the past, chip-in seven-irons from 120 yards and hitting three-woods from 217. You’ve got to go into the archive and sort of try and remember some of the shots you’ve played back then.” Collin Morikawa should, like McIlroy, survive the cut by a shot. Among those definitely heading for an early exits from Yas Links are Robert MacIntyre – who followed up a 69 with a wounding 80 – and Nicolai Højgaard.",Sport/Sport,Rory McIlroy battles his game and the wind on brutal day in the desert,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/21/rory-mcilroy-battles-his-game-and-the-wind-on-brutal-day-in-the-desert
1/22/2022,"Actors have nightmares of going on in a play for which they haven’t been given a script. But some of Britain’s best-known performers – including Sir Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, Harry Hill and Sanjeev Bhaskar – have volunteered to endure that sweaty scenario for one night at a north London theatre. Shortly before the play begins, that night’s guest star will be taken backstage at the Park theatre and offered a choice of coats, hats, moustaches and wigs, then fitted with an earpiece to be fed the lines of a detective investigating a crime.  “It’s quite a terrifying prospect,” says Bhaskar. “But when I saw the list of people who’ve done it already, I thought: that’s a gang I want to be part of.” He is referring to the first run of Whodunnit (Unrehearsed) at the Park in 2019, which featured Gillian Anderson, Jim Broadbent and Matthew Broderick. No theatre could afford so many stars, but both casts signed up for free to raise funds for the Park, which receives no regular Arts Council or local authority subsidy. Needing carefully to manage its finances since opening in 2013, the Park has, like all theatres, been destabilised by the pandemic. Emma Thompson, one of the one-off investigators in Whodunnit (Unrehearsed) 2 in February, says that she became involved as a local theatregoer and resident. She calls the Park “a fantastically important part of the fabric of north London” and says “we’ve never needed the healing, communal experience of theatre more”. Bhaskar is also motivated by being part of a cultural comeback: “I think some people thought, when theatres were closed during lockdown, it just meant a bunch of actors being out of work and they were probably used to that. But it hit electricians, carpenters and front-of-house staff. And cafes, pubs and shops around theatres that lost their custom … The impact was very far-reaching.” Jez Bond, Park artistic director and co-writer (with Mark Cameron) of Whodunnit, suggests that, in some ways, the recovery period may be more perilous than the emergency. During lockdowns, the Park was closed but supported by furlough and Culture Recovery Fund grants. Now, it is fully open but its box office affected by a residual hesitancy among audiences about sitting indoors for two hours with strangers. “Anecdotally, across London, immediately after the Omicron variant was revealed,” says Bond, “sales of tickets went down to around 20% of what they had been the previous day. And that’s a terrifying drop which spoke to the lack of audience confidence. And that – in combination with the lack of any further government support for theatres – makes the situation very tricky.” Comparing the days on which booking opened, the current run took around a quarter of the cash that the 2019 Whodunnit announcement attracted. Bond stresses that the box-office take has now vastly improved. But even so: “People are more nervous about going out and spending money than three years ago, so we have to much more actively go after them.” While those in charge of state and council funding might argue that the Park is lucky to have so many famous neighbours willing to support it, Thompson questions whether the venue should be so dependent on such charity: “One of the most important tools in the government’s hands is the funding of local, small theatres. Less expensive than West End venues, they can offer experiences that, at a time when our collective mental health has been as much attacked as our physical health, would make an enormous difference to our wellbeing.” Guest stars are asked to turn up on their night completely unprepared. Nervous or swottish performers, I suggest to Bhaskar, could talk to colleagues who have done the show or go and watch a performance before theirs. “Either of those pieces of skulduggery is possible. I haven’t been asked not to do that; but I wouldn’t. It may be, as people say these days, ‘technically within the rules’, but, morally, it would be wrong.” Meera Syal, who is married to Bhaskar, is also taking part in the run. “It will be an interesting dynamic in the house,” he says. “But, with Unforgotten [ITV’s cold-case psycho-drama starring Bhaskar], I never tell Meera anything about the plot, even if she asks for hints while watching. So I imagine that’s how we will do it.” Within the general fun of the production, those interested in types and techniques of theatre get to see, unusally, a completely spontaneous performer interacting with a cast who have prepared in the usual way. (Even in the Morecambe & Wise drama, The Play What I Wrote, which uses guest celebrities, they rehearse and learn lines.) “We rehearse it so tightly with different people playing the detective,” Bond explains. “For example, there’s a moment where, for the gag to work, we really need the guest to be at a certain point on the stage. So we make sure the permanent actors rehearse it with people going to different places, so they have to work out how to get round it.” Bond was fascinated by the different approaches chosen by actors. Gillian Anderson went comedic, wearing a moustache, while Adrian Dunbar played the detective DCS Hastings-straight. A number of the invited cast list are comedians, perhaps professionally more likely to ad lib or add business. One aspect is beyond the control of the volunteer. There are popular, possibly apocryphal, theatrical anecdotes about veteran actors relying on a radio earpiece to prompt forgotten dialogue and startling an audience, in the middle of Shakespeare or Chekhov, by suddenly declaiming: “Mrs Hancock, 42 Acacia Avenue to Heathrow airport asap!” Is there a risk of the Park’s guest detectives accidentally receiving taxi communications? “I know those stories, so it’s a very good question,” says Bond. “I don’t think that could happen to us. But we have changed our technology, based on the first run.” Bhaskar, who admits that he has expressed concerns about the prompts dropping out, is reassured by the fact that his career-making series The Kumars at No 42 was “half-scripted, half-ad-libbed”. His general instinct about Whodunnit is that “you have to play it fairly straight to keep the story going. But who knows? I might find myself required to do something utterly ridiculous.” Whodunnit (Unrehearsed) 2 is at the Park theatre, London, 9 February to 12 March",Arts/Stage,Whodunnit?

1/22/2022,"With her white go-go boots and thick lashes, the Green M&M was the Marilyn Monroe of the confectionery world. Everyone adored her – girls, gays and gamers alike. Green appeared in adverts crawling on her hands and knees at the beach like a 2000s Jennifer Lopez video. She was always engaged in flirtatious lesbian banter with the other female M&M, the coquettish Brown, or putting a piece of chocolate into her mouth before making a joke about premature ejaculation. When the feminist academic Camille Paglia once wrote that “the great sex symbols of Hollywood were manufactured beings, engineered by trial and error, with the mass audience as their ultimate judge and jury”. I like to think she was talking about the Green M&M. Not so any more.  In a move that is sure to genuinely rattle Fox News hosts like a box of Tic Tacs, Mars Wrigley announced on Thursday that the M&M squad will be undergoing a “progressive” makeover. Green will now wear trainers in order to “reflect confidence and empowerment as a strong female” who is “known for much more than her boots”. Brown’s heels will also be lowered to a more professional height. Red, the cocksure alpha of the group, has learned to treat his co-chocolates with kindness, while anxious Orange will be “embracing his true self” (ie, tying his shoelaces, presumably because he’s afraid of falling down). Mars has also confirmed that M&Ms will be “moving away from only one body size” and stripped of their prefixes to highlight “their personalities rather than their gender”. The decision was obviously reported as paying “woke” service to Gen Z, but anyone who has spent more than two minutes on TikTok will know that Gen Z’s primary interests consist of asking celebrities to spit on them and making jokes with at least five layers of ironic detachment. On the M&MS website, each candy now has a short interview to reveal more of their personality. Green, for example, announces that her best quality is now “being a hypewoman” while Blue quotes a Beyoncé song from eight years ago. This is what you get when a bunch of executives – who haven’t had much to do for the last two years because the office has been shut – get together and try to “disrupt” their industry by pandering to a demographic they haven’t interacted with for 20 years. Brands think they can appeal to Gen Z by making a slightly more diverse cast of anthropomorphic characters aimed at selling you chocolate-branded boxer shorts, but anxious teens aren’t looking for a role model in an anxiety-ridden orange M&M. They’re looking to escape brands as much as possible by foraging and cosplaying as anime maids on TikTok. If Mars really wanted to appeal to Gen Z, they should have given each M&M a bisexual girlfriend and £40,000 in student debt.",Lifestyle/Life and style,M&Ms are slut-shaming the Green one – this is not what Gen Z wants,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/21/mms-progressive-makeover
