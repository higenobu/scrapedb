1/20/2022,"Australia’s drugs regulator has for the first time approved oral treatments for Covid-19 which should help address supply shortages of other treatments. The approval applies to two drugs – Paxlovid and Lagevrio. They have been “provisionally” approved, which means they can be administered by health professionals in limited circumstances but the manufacturers must submit further data as the drugs are used more widely.  The director of infectious diseases at Mater Health Services, associate professor Paul Griffin, said on Thursday: “We’ve got great safe and effective vaccines. We’ve got intravenously administered antivirals and monoclonal antibodies, which have certainly helped us. But what we’ve been missing right now is an oral therapy that changes the course of the Covid illness.” They both stop the virus from reproducing readily in cells of the body – and they do that in slightly different ways. Lagevrio causes errors during the viral replication process “to the point where the virus is no longer viable and doesn’t survive that process,” Griffin said. Paxlovid blocks a critical enzyme – a protease – that the virus needs to replicate itself. Either medicine should ideally be administered as soon as possible after diagnosis and within five days of the onset of symptoms. The medicines are taken twice a day for five days. In clinical trials, both drugs were very effective in reducing rates of death. The treatments can only be given to adults with Covid-19 who do not yet require oxygen but who are at increased risk of progression to hospitalisation or death – for example, the elderly or immunocompromised. This is also the case for other treatments available. But until now, those treatments had to be delivered through intravenous infusion in a hospital or other medical setting, or through consecutive intramuscular injections. There have also been supply shortages of some of these treatments. “The oral therapies are going to be easier to use,” Griffin said. “They’re going to be easier to get to people earlier, which is really important with all these kinds of interventions. How quickly we give them can in many ways determine how well they work. “This also reduces the burden on the healthcare system as these oral therapies can be very much community focused, rather than requiring a hospital bed and resources to administer.” It will have a clear benefit for people in aged care, who won’t have to be transferred to hospital for intravenous treatment. A research fellow in clinical pharmacology at Flinders University, associate professor Andrew Rowland, said most existing Covid-19 treatments and vaccines targeted the virus’s spike protein. “Paxlovid is an important new treatment for Covid patients as it targets a unique process in Covid replication that is not related to the spike protein,” he said. “This means that Paxlovid is less likely to lose efficacy due to mutations in the spike protein, which to date have been associated with the major variants including Delta and Omicron”. The Australian government has secured 500,000 treatment courses of Paxlovid and 300,000 courses of Lagevrio for supply during 2022, with the first deliveries due in the coming weeks. No Covid treatments are an alternative to vaccination. Not only are treatments reserved for the most at-risk cases but there may also continue to be supply shortages of treatments throughout the pandemic. Importantly, treatments only work for a short period of time, whereas vaccines provide longer-lasting protection. “Vaccines work so tremendously well at stopping people progressing to severe disease but also preventing people from getting the infection and passing it on,” Griffin said. “These drug therapies certainly won’t do all those things. They’re an added tool to vaccination that will make a huge difference to the most vulnerable.” Rowland added that the drugs were also expensive. “Currently a disproportionate number of patients being treated for Covid with monoclonal antibodies in the community, being admitted to hospital, and requiring ICU beds are unvaccinated,” he said. “The expense of supplying Paxlovid to these Australians will place a further burden on an already overstretched healthcare system. We can afford to vaccinate 32 children for the cost of treating one person with Paxlovid.”",News/Australia news,Australia has approved oral treatments for Covid: how do the pills work and who will benefit most?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/20/australia-has-approved-oral-treatments-for-covid-how-do-the-pills-work-and-who-will-benefit-most
1/20/2022,"It was a career honor Jeff Daniels probably didn’t think he was going to be bestowed with. The famed actor, musician, and producer on Wednesday etched his way into history by inspiring the name of a very special newly discovered species of worm. The parasite – now dubbed Tarantobelus jeffdanielsi – kills tarantulas, just like Daniels did in the 1990 cult classic Arachnophobia. (Note: for all those concerned – unlike his newly discovered namesake – Daniels did not actually kill any spiders. Allegedly no arachnids were harmed on set).  Being named after a self-fertilizing hermaphroditic worm that lives for about 11 days in a lab is a “distinction no other entertainer can claim”, a news release out of University of California, Riverside trumpeting the achievement said. Tarantobelus jeffdanielsi is just one of more than 25,000 species of nematodes – also known as a roundworm – that have been discovered and named. The plentiful parasites, considered to be “among the most abundant animals on Earth”, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica, can be found on plants, in beer malts, and even deep within the Earth’s crust. The Tarantobelus jeffdanielsi is the only one that takes down tarantulas. The worms inhabit the spiders’ mouths and impact their behavior in strange ways, including causing them to walk on their tiptoes. They also impact and inhibit the spider’s use of its fangs. “His character in the film is a spider killer, which is exactly what these nematodes are,” said UC Riverside parasitologist Adler Dillman of Daniels. Dillman, who led the team that discovered the Jeffdanielsi, was initially tipped off when he received a call from a wholesale tarantula breeder losing his spiders to a strange illness in 2019.Daniels has expressed appreciation for the honor. “When I first heard a new species of nematode had been named after me, I thought, ‘Why? Is there a resemblance?’ he said in response to UCR. He added that the name made him smile, “And of course, in Hollywood, you haven’t really made it until you’ve been recognized by those in the field of parasitology.”",News/World news,‘Why?

1/20/2022,"Australia’s jobless rate dropped to the lowest in more than 13 years as the economy burst out of the post-lockdown gates in late 2021, generating momentum that has prompted one of the nation’s big four banks to bring forward its prediction of the first hike in official interest rates. The economy added 64,800 jobs in December, lowering the unemployment rate to 4.2% from a previously reported 4.6% in November when a record number of extra positions were taken up, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said.  The survey, though, carried a qualification that it only captured the 28 November-11 December period. That preceded the worst of the disruptions of soaring numbers of Omicron Covid cases. Even so, “this is the lowest unemployment rate since August 2008, just before the start of the global financial crisis and Lehman Brothers collapse, when it was 4%”, the ABS labour economist Bjorn Jarvis said. “[F]or a rate below 4% we need to look back to the 1970s when the survey was quarterly. “Recovery in New South Wales and Victoria continued to have a large influence on the national figures, with employment in these two states increasing by 32,000 and 25,000 people between November and December,” Jarvis said. “Their employment was around where it had been in May, having fallen 250,000 and 145,000 during the lockdowns [respectively].” The latest figures underscore the strength of the economy at the end of 2021. The huge fiscal stimulus by states and the federal government, household savings topping $200bn and record-low official interests all combined to stoke economic activity before Omicron disrupted supply chains and prevented many thousands from working because of infections or being in close contact with Covid-positive people. However, Westpac signalled it’s seen enough strength in the economy to advance the timing of when it expects the first move by the central bank to lift its official annual cash rate from 0.1%. The sinking jobless rate was part of its calculus, and if the bank is right, mortgage holders will have to fork out more on their burgeoning loans sooner than they may have expected. Financial markets have been tipping a June 2022 move by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Since June 2021, Westpac had pencilled in the first RBA rate rise to come in February 2023. It has now shifted its expectation to this August. Then the central bank will raise the official rate by 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage points, to 0.25%, and will follow up with a full quarter-point rate rise to 0.5% by October, Westpac predicted. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We are more optimistic about the unemployment rate than the [RBA’s] latest forecasts,” Westpac said in a briefing note this morning. “Currently the [RBA] expects the unemployment rate to reach 4.25% by end 2022 and 4.5% by the month of June 2022 – our same forecasts are 3.8% and 4.1%, respectively.” Westpac said. “The [RBA] Board would probably view around 4% as full employment – an objective the Bank does not expect to achieve until end 2023 but which we expect by June 2022.” Economists have been monitoring how much consumer sentiment has been dimmed by Omicron-triggered distortions at work and as supermarkets and others struggle to supply meat, cheese and various other products. The Commonwealth Bank’s latest Household Spending Intentions index, also released on Thursday, ended 2021 at its highest level since the series began in July 2017.

It registered strong gains for retail, travel and transport prior to the Omicron impacts showing up. Notably, the home buying sub-index extended its recent falls, dropping 17.3% in December compared with the previous month. “It is a generally weak month seasonally for home-loan applications and was compounded by falls in Google searches for real-estate listings,” the report said. Employers, meanwhile, were struggling to fill a historically high number of job vacancies at least as of 11 December, the ABS said, noting the number of people in the employment market had steadied after a jump during the previous month. “[T]he participation rate remained steady in December, at 66.1%,” Jarvis said. “This was in contrast to what we saw in November, when a large number of people who were attached to a job re-entered the labour force, which drove the participation rate up by 1.4 percentage points.” The participation rate remained 0.2 percentage points higher than just prior to the start of the pandemic and only 0.2 percentage points below the historical high in May and June 2021, he said.Andrew McKellar, the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said today’s labour data offered “a rear-view observation of employment”. “With labour and skills shortages across many sectors, already strong labour force figures make clear that further emphasis is needed from government to boost workforce participation, invest in skills and [vocational training], and establish an ambitious skilled migration program,” McKellar said. “Whilst we can expect Omicron to disrupt these strong gains in early 2022, these pressures are likely to quickly re-emerge as case numbers begin to fall.” Among the states, South Australia – which goes to the polls in March state elections – saw its jobless drop to a seasonally adjusted 3.9%, or the lowest since the series began in 1978. Western Australia was even lower at 3.4%, while NSW sat at 4%, Victoria 4.2%, Queensland 4.7%, Tasmania 3.9%, the ACT 4.5% and the Northern Territory at 4.2%.",News/Business,Australia’s unemployment rate drops to lowest point in more than 13 years,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/20/australias-unemployment-rate-drops-to-lowest-point-in-more-than-13-years
