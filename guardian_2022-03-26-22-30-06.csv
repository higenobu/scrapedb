3/26/2022,"It’s hard to imagine a more daunting gig in rock than taking the drumstool in a group fronted by Dave Grohl, widely celebrated as the greatest drummer of his generation. That gig would have seemed all the more daunting, considering Foo Fighters’ previous drummer, William Goldsmith, had exited after Grohl rerecorded the drums for the group’s troubled second album, The Colour And The Shape, believing Goldsmith’s contributions not up to scratch. That Taylor Hawkins chose to grab this seemingly poisoned chalice regardless spoke to his confidence in his own drumming, but also the strength of the bond he’d already built with Grohl. Hawkins would hold tight to that drumstool for 25 years, until his untimely death on Friday, treasured by the Foos’ loyal fans for his skills as a drummer and songwriter, his abundant ebullience onstage and in music videos, and his obvious affectionate kinship with Grohl. Texas-born, California-raised Hawkins was playing drums for Alanis Morissette when he first crossed paths with Grohl in 1996. Both Hawkins and Grohl were spending that summer playing festivals in Europe; Morissette was very much the more successful artist then, her breakthrough, Jagged Little Pill, the year’s best-selling album, having shifted a staggering 18m copies worldwide. Still, Hawkins was intimidated when he first met Grohl. “Nirvana were my favourite band in the world at that time,” Hawkins told me in 2005, “and I was convinced Dave would think I was a dork. But he came up and introduced himself to me, and was really complimentary, just a really nice cat. “Everybody tells us we’re like brothers, but we’re actually very different – but we had a similar energy, not to sound like a fucking hippie.” Grohl, meanwhile, recalled that his first impression of Hawkins was “this fuckin’ crazy partying surfer. Which was absolutely correct.” The following year, after Goldsmith’s exit from the Foos, Hawkins reached out to Grohl. “I’d read that Will was quitting Foo Fighters, or being fired or whatever,” Hawkins told me later. “I got hold of Dave and told him: ‘Yo, I heard you’re looking for a drummer.’ And he said: ‘Yeah, you know anybody?’ Cocksucker! He made me ask [for the job] ... Actually, since Alanis was one of the biggest artists in the world at the time, and Foo Fighters were still just kinda starting out, he thought: ‘Why would you want to bail on someone who’s selling 30m records?’ But I wanted to play rock music, and I loved the Foo Fighters – they were my favourite band.” Hawkins made his studio debut with Foo Fighters’ third album, 1999’s There Is Nothing Left To Lose, recorded as a bare trio of Grohl, Hawkins and bassist Nate Mendel in the basement of a house in Virginia, Grohl trying to exorcise the bruising experience of making The Colour And The Shape. In Hawkins, Grohl found a kindred spirit: able to hold his own on the drumkit and match Grohl’s pulverising, disciplined and never showy style, sharing Grohl’s passion for then-unfashionable classic and heavy rock influences, and with a joyous nature that bore the group aloft in moments of tension. Grohl himself had always seemed the goofy, sunshine element amid the darkness of his previous group, Nirvana. Now, in Hawkins, he’d located his own Dave Grohl figure for Foo Fighters. “Taylor and I are like brothers,” he said, years later. “The two of us are best friends. You only find so many best friends in a lifetime. Taylor and I wound up being separated at birth.” There Is Nothing Left To Lose struck a perfect balance between Grohl’s native grungy instincts and his love for melodic rock; it remains Foo Fighters’ finest album, and surely the injection of positivity that came with Hawkins’ arrival on the drumstool was a key element. Bands are hostages to precarious, volatile chemistry, and for all their lovable public image and abundant bonhomie, Foo Fighters have been as subject to internal ructions as any. But Hawkins’ giddy presence had always seemed a balming influence, as the group enjoyed subsequent commercial success and pursued ambitious projects such as their acoustic/electric double album, 2005’s In Your Honor, or their documentary series/album Sonic Highways, or, indeed, their recently released horror movie, Studio 666. Hawkins and Grohl’s unique connection electrified Foo Fighters’ live performances, with Hawkins telling one interviewer that the duo would “get into these battles live, guitar versus drums and Dave’s virtually playing drums on the guitar ... and I like to sing a little bit and he can go back on the drums and remember what real hard work is and then go back out front.” Indeed, it’s hard to imagine Foo Fighters without Hawkins’ high-spirited presence. When, in August 2001, Hawkins overdosed in heroin, Grohl sat by the drummer’s bedside while he remained in a coma for a fortnight. Grohl later told biographer Paul Brannigan that those weeks were “the first time in my life that I ever considered quitting music. Because I was wondering if music just equalled death. I didn’t want to do music if everyone is just gonna die all the time. I was out of my mind, I was so frightened, and heartbroken and confused. And I said to everyone: ‘I don’t even wanna hear the word Foo Fighters until I’m ready to say it again.’” Hawkins recovered, and later described the experience in terms of a wake-up call as regards his hard-partying ways. Grohl, meanwhile, realised he needed to stretch his wings beyond Foo Fighters, going on to pursue his all-star metal project Probot and playing drums with Queens Of The Stone Age, among other extra-curricular activities. And while Foo Fighters soon reunited, Hawkins also began to explore other avenues. The three albums he recorded as Taylor Hawkins And The Coattail Riders side-project – which he described to me as “a bit of a piss-take, as you British say”, though it’s clear it was more heartfelt than that – allowed him to indulge his classic rock fantasies, and showcase his gifts as a singer-songwriter, which Foo Fighters fans had glimpsed on Cold Day In The Sun, the Tom Petty-esque soft-rocker he wrote and sang for In Your Honor. The Coattail Riders’ three albums featured appearances from luminaries such as Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen, Chrissie Hynde, Nancy Wilson of Heart, Sex Pistol Steve Jones and James Gang’s Joe Walsh. Hawkins also fronted another group, the much heavier The Birds Of Satan, which grew out of his heavy rock covers band, Chevy Metal. But Hawkins’ true allegiance was always to Foo Fighters. Just over a week ago, 18 March, marked the 25th anniversary of the announcement of his joining the group. On Friday night, Foo Fighters were supposed to be headlining the opening night of the Estéreo Picnic festival in Bogotá, Colombia. In their place, the organisers played a message reading “Taylor Hawkins Por Siempre” over the video screens, as fans sang along to Foo Fighters’ 1996 anthem My Hero. The void left by Hawkins’ passing will be profound.",Arts/Music,Taylor Hawkins: a joyous presence whose true allegiance was always to Foo Fighters,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/26/taylor-hawkins-death-foo-fighters
3/26/2022,"“Decide who you are with” Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the European council, pointing to a choice that is becoming increasingly hard to avoid, as the sheer violence of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine crystallises the division of the world into two camps. The camp that stands with Russians is becoming easier to define with every passing day of the war. The colour-coded scoreboard at the UN general assembly in recent weeks, recording the votes on resolutions deploring the attack and calling for a ceasefire, could not have been clearer. Among the 193 member states represented on the board, there have only been five pinpricks of red opposing the motion: Russia, Belarus, North Korea, Syria and Eritrea - a tight club of autocracies and totalitarian regimes with appalling human rights records. They have been surrounded by a sea of green, the at least 140 countries who have supported expressions of rebuke at the world’s parliament. Most of them are democracies, underlining one of the themes of Joe Biden’s foreign policy outlook, that the world is approaching a decisive struggle between democracy and autocracy, whose outcome is uncertain and therefore requires the active engagement of democratic nations. “The single most important thing we had to do in the west is be united,” Biden declared at Thursday’s EU summit, marking the first time a US president has attended a European Council meeting. US officials have pleased to see how the invasion of Ukraine has welded together US allies in Europe and the Pacific in a global cause, with Japan, Australia, South Korea and New Zealand all joining in with sanctions. “There is a ubiquitous quality of the appeal of Ukraine and that cuts through barriers and it’s profound. ​​It transcends both Europe and Asia,” a senior US official said. “This is a manifestation of an understanding that we share, a common progressive engagement.” The official pointed to a third reason, that he argued was the most decisive. “Our Asian partners do not want Ukraine to be a model of how problems can be solved in the Indo-Pacific, particularly as it relates to some place like Taiwan.” Amid all the green on the UN scoreboard, however, there was also a fair spattering of yellow, 38 abstentions of countries still sitting on the fence in the most recent vote on Thursday. Those include the world’s most populous countries, China and India, representing more than a third of humanity between them. And on top of those abstaining, there are many countries who have criticised Moscow, without taking the next step, the imposition of sanctions. Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy’s question to the European Council about taking sides was directed specifically at Viktor Orbán, the prime minister of Hungary, whose government voted for a UN resolution deploring the attack on Ukraine, but has been adamantly opposed to energy sanctions, providing arms to Ukraine, or even letting arms supplies cross its territory. “There is no time to hesitate. It’s time to decide,” Zelenskiy warned Orbán, pointing to the mounting civilian death toll. The Ukrainian president does his homework on his fellow leaders and will have been well aware that Orbán is facing a strong challenge from opposition leader Péter Márki-Zay, who is using is the unpopularity of the prime minister’s ambivalent stance on Ukraine to his advantage, accusing Orbán of having brought “shame on Hungary”. Some of the other notable abstentions were about history, like South Africa’s, driven by old ties between the African National Congress and Moscow. Others represented shifting allegiances. On the UN security council the US and its allies have been especially annoyed at the non-committal role of the United Arab Emirates, normally seen as a reliable US ally in the Middle East. But increasingly the Emiratis’ de facto ruler, Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, has found common cause with Moscow in opposing radical Islam and democracy in the region. The crown prince of Abu Dhabi has declined calls from Biden and infuriated Washington just over a week ago by inviting the Russian-backed Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, for a state visit, opening a door out of isolation. In this looming civilisational contest, the most important swing vote is India, the one major democracy not to oppose the attack. Not only did the government of Narendra Modi abstain at the UN, failing to even mention Russia in its bland description of the unfolding catastrophe in Ukraine, it is also working towards setting up a rouble-rupee trading mechanism that will help Moscow avoid dollar-oriented sanctions. Mira Rapp-Hooper, the director for the Indo-Pacific on the US national security council, said on Friday that the administration expected Modi’s response, but suggested it was not sustainable. “I think we would certainly all acknowledge and agree that when it comes to votes at the UN, India’s position on the current crisis has been unsatisfactory, to say the least. But it’s also been totally unsurprising,” Rapp-Hooper said. The Ukraine war is a strategic nightmare for Delhi, which has long seen Russia, and before it the Soviet Union, as a security partner of last resort. But Vladimir Putin’s ill-judged military adventure has increased Russian dependence on China, casting in doubt what Moscow would do in the next outbreak in the confrontation between India and China on their border. Delhi was now thinking “long and hard” about its military dependency on Russia, Rapp-Hopper said, adding that India should get help in weaning itself off that reliance. “I think our perspective would be that the way forward involves keeping India close, thinking hard about how to present it with options, so that it can continue to provide for its strategic autonomy,” she said. China’s abstention is of another kind, one that conceals support rather than reflects ambivalence. It would have been hard for Beijing to vote against a resolution upholding the national sovereignty and territorial integrity that it has made the watchwords of its foreign policy. But its official UN statements calling for peace are in contrast to all the Russian propaganda on the war echoed by the Chinese media and foreign ministry statements blaming the US and Nato for the conflict. Washington now fears Beijing will back up its economic support for Moscow with arms supplies. The administration’s analysis is that the staunchly pro-Russia policy is driven by the personal bond between Xi Jinping and Putin, who have met nearly 40 times and in February declared there would be “no limits” to the bilateral relationship, and a shared priority, to cut the US down to size. Economically, Beijing’s stance makes no sense at all for China, whose trade with the US and Europe, dwarfs its economic relationship with an increasingly impoverished Russia. But the hardening of the lines between the opposing global camps suggests that the hopes that globalisation would spread peace through economic interdependence were ill-founded.

3/26/2022,"It can be hard to too get excited about the Oscars, but at least the international category at tomorrow’s ceremony is particularly interesting this year, with clubhouse leader Drive My Car (stream on BFI, Curzon), from Japan, facing groundbreaking Danish animated documentary Flee (Curzon). Also in with a shout is “instant classic” The Worst Person in the World, now in UK cinemas. The Oslo-set film from Joachim Trier is his first fiction feature since 2017’s well-regarded supernatural thriller Thelma. In 2018, with his brother Emil, he made the documentary The Other Munch. Merging brooding Norwegian sensibilities new and old, it followed the writer Karl Ove Knausgård as he curated an exhibition of Edvard Munch paintings at the Munch museum (no pressure, Karl!). Though Munch and Vincent van Gogh never met, both “felt the world crying out to express itself in colours”, according to the Guardian’s Jonathan Jones, writing when their work was hung together in Amsterdam in 2015. Lately there have been – arguably crass – attempts to bring Van Gogh’s art to life at confusingly competing immersive experiences seemingly everywhere, including London, Bristol, York, Leicester and Edinburgh. Outsized artist/director Julian Schnabel rendered Van Gogh with At Eternity’s Gate, starring Willem Dafoe as the man himself. (For a further rabbit hole detour, take a look at Schnabel’s enjoyably wild Manhattan home Palazzo Chupi.) Featuring in a small role was Lolita Chammah, daughter of French actor Isabelle Huppert. Staying in an artist’s light, they both have roles in the forthcoming Caravaggio’s Shadow. Huppert has worked with every provocateur, auteur and genius to bounce from the Croisette to the Oscars. In 2015 she appeared in Joachim Trier’s underwhelming English-language debut, Louder Than Bombs. Stick instead with his Oslo trilogy: Reprise is on Netflix; Oslo, August 31st can be rented, with The Worst Person in the World the final part.

3/26/2022,"For William Morris, the Oxfordshire village of Kelmscott was “heaven on earth”. An old farmhouse became a beloved rural retreat and inspiration for the pioneering designer, author, architectural conservationist and social reformer, widely regarded as the father of the arts and crafts movement. Now Kelmscott Manor, near Lechlade, is reopening to the public on 1 April following a £6m renovation project, preserving and enhancing it for future generations. Morris took a joint lease on it in 1871 and lived there until his death in 1896. The manor was built around 1600 for a working farmer, and Morris saw its architecture as unspoilt and unpretentious, encapsulating working lives and rural crafts. He felt that the locally quarried stone suggested walls that had “grown up out of the soil”, describing its “quaint garrets amongst great timbers of the roof where of old times the tillers and herdsmen slept”. Few buildings in Britain have had as strong an impact on the nation’s artistic life as Kelmscott Manor. It was a place of huge inspiration for an artist who dramatically influenced fashions and ideologies with fabrics and furniture, stained glass and wallpaper still produced today. Many of his most popular, enduring designs drew on the flora and fauna in the surrounding landscape. Watching thrushes steal strawberries outside the manor inspired his classic furnishing textile, “Strawberry Thief”, which decorates the Old Hall inside. Willows growing around the house shaped his famous “Willow Bough” pattern. His daughter, May, later recalled her father pointing out details of the leaf-forms on a walk: “Soon afterwards, this paper was done, a keenly observed rendering of our willows that has embowered many a London living-room.” His seminal literary work News from Nowhere, published in 1890, includes perceptive descriptions of the house and its surroundings. Kelmscott still retains many of his designs and furniture. It was Morris who wrote: “Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful.” The property, which is today owned by the Society of Antiquaries of London, Britain’s oldest learned society, needed extensive remedial work, including measures to stop water getting through the brickwork. The renovation has been made possible by a £4.3m grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and £1.3m from the Kelmscott Manor: Past Present & Future campaign, which continues to raise funds. Martin Levy, a leading expert on Morris and chairman of the Kelmscott campaign, told the Observer: “Kelmscott is so magical. You hear the crows screeching in the trees, the daffodils coming up, the river beside the house. The public is going to see the house brought back to life more authentically. “Using inventories, photographs and watercolours, the curator Kathy Haslam has done archaeological research into how the house looked while Morris was there. They’ve been able to place furniture and objects where they were originally. So you get a feeling of a house that’s lived in rather than a cold, museum-like shrine. The curator has really brought Morris’s ‘heaven on earth’ to life. I’ve been bowled over by the richness of the colours in the rooms.” Wallpaper has been reinstated to several rooms, with designs individually printed by hand using the original blocks from the Morris & Co archives. Analysis of long-hidden paint-layers offered further clues to his colour schemes. What was always referred to as the Green Room has now been repainted in its original dark green, “Brunswick green”, which was the name given to a blend of Prussian blue and chrome yellow – a colour that Morris found “restful to the eyes”. The manor also played its part in shaping his thinking about art, conservation and society. He was a tireless activist for socialism. He also believed that art, like education, should be for everyone, and the Kelmscott renovation includes a new learning centre for schools and community groups. A single-storey thatched timber building, designed by Architecton, has been built on the site of a lost cattle byre. It was at Kelmscott that one of the most complex three-sided love affairs in art history unfolded. Morris had initially leased the manor with his friend, the Pre-Raphaelite artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who was then romantically involved with Morris’s wife, Jane, an embroiderer. Rossetti left in 1874, never to return, and it became a much-loved country retreat for the Morris family. But among the notable paintings reinstated at Kelmscott is The Blue Silk Dress, 1868, perhaps Rossetti’s best known portrait of Jane Morris. In a new guidebook, Jeremy Musson, the architectural and art historian, writes that Kelmscott Manor was always a welcoming place: “Its spirit is summed up in Morris’s postscript to his printer before a visit in 1888: ‘P.S. As everybody may be out when you come, look under the mat and you will find the house key. Enter and be happy’.”",Arts/Culture,William Morris’s ‘heaven on earth’ Oxfordshire home restored to former glory,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/26/william-morris-heaven-on-earth-oxfordshire-home-restored-to-former-glory
3/26/2022,"The immediate thought is that it cannot happen. Mohamed Salah, the embodiment of this glorious period of Liverpool’s history, cannot be allowed to leave: the club have to give him whatever he wants. Just make sure he stays, keeps rattling along at 20-odd goals a season, many of which will be stunning, keeps delighting both fans and neutrals with his verve and imagination. But the immediate thought may not be entirely helpful: no player is ever irreplaceable. Of course, there is a sentimental appeal to the idea that a player and a club have a special relationship, particularly when that player has been instrumental in a club’s rise, as Salah has been for Liverpool under Jürgen Klopp. But circumstances change. Liverpool’s history is a study in the importance of not becoming unduly attached to heroes, of moving players on at the right time. By his own admission, Bill Shankly allowed his first great Liverpool team to grow old together, until the FA Cup defeat to Watford in 1970 shocked him into action. His successor, Bob Paisley, quieter but far more ruthless, never made the same mistake. When Kevin Keegan decided to escape the UK’s upper-rate income tax of 83% in 1977, Liverpool signed Kenny Dalglish. The key to long-term management is to an extent knowing when to offload players – which is one of the reasons football can be such a brutal, apparently ungrateful, sport. Similarly, Alex Ferguson never let players outstay their usefulness: he culled Mark Hughes, Andrei Kanchelskis and Paul Ince in 1995 and was just as swift to release Roy Keane a decade later. Even the very greatest can outstay their welcome. For all the wailing and hand-wringing when Lionel Messi left Barcelona, recent evidence is that a reset was long overdue: elite sides cannot operate at the pace of an ageing talisman. A glance at the slough from which Arsenal are beginning to emerge should be warning enough of the dangers of panicking and handing ageing stars inflated contracts. That’s not to say Liverpool should be looking to sell Salah; rather that there should be a clinical assessment of whether the cost of keeping him is worth it. In terms of their squad, Liverpool have been run supremely well recently. That they have – just about – kept pace with Manchester City despite spending a net £220m less over the past five seasons is remarkable. They have been very good at keeping the budget in check; does it make any sense now to jeopardise that by meeting Salah’s demand to double his salary to £400,000 a week? Whether he deserves it is not really the point. Salah, of course, has a right to negotiate the best possible deal. Given he is one of the best players in the world, it follows that he should be one of the best-paid players in the world. He turns 30 in June: this will probably be his last major contract – why wouldn’t he try to ensure it leaves him as comfortable as possible for the rest of his life? There is a romantic answer, which is that it might be hoped Salah had developed some kind of affection for Liverpool, for Klopp, for his teammates and for the fans. Would he not relish another Premier League title at Anfield – this time, perhaps, won with fans in the stadium? Would he not relish another Champions League success – this time, perhaps, with him on the pitch for whatever the equivalent of the 4-0 win over Barcelona happened to be? At what point do memories outweigh another few million pounds in the bank, or the domestic league winner’s medal that should come almost as of right with Juventus or Paris Saint-Germain, who appear the two favourites to sign him? But there is also a more pragmatic answer that lies within the question of whether Salah made Liverpool great or Liverpool made Salah great. Clearly to an extent, it’s both. Salah is a magnificent footballer, a brilliant dribbler and a superb finisher. But as anybody who saw him wandering around listlessly for Egypt at the Africa Cup of Nations knows, it’s also true that he is unusually well-suited to Liverpool’s style of play; he is not guaranteed to be that good in any lineup. He looked a very good player at Fiorentina and Roma, but it is only since his move to Anfield in 2017 that he has become exceptional. Roberto Firmino and then Diogo Jota have been adept at dropping deep to create room for him to swoop into, while Trent Alexander-Arnold’s surges outside have also helped generate space. But it’s also a matter of the whole style, the hard and high press, the dynamic midfield that wins the ball back early, that has helped. Without a major overhaul, it can safely be assumed he wouldn’t have that at either PSG (deep-lying midfield to compensate for celebrity forwards) or Juventus (just not Massimiliano Allegri’s style). There are plenty of players whose big move hasn’t quite worked out, from Eden Hazard to Romelu Lukaku, Antoine Griezmann to Philippe Coutinho. There is a tendency to assume that the quality of players is absolute when, in fact, it’s often contingent on circumstance, their value and form in part derived from the structure of which they are part. Salah may move on and thrive, but there are no guarantees. And while Liverpool would miss him, the form of Luis Díaz since his arrival in January suggests they could cope. The system looks strong enough now to endure the loss of any individual.",Sport/Football,Anfield and Salah are a perfect match – but Liverpool could cope without their hero | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/26/mohamed-salah-liverpool
3/26/2022,"The Royal Opera’s new Peter Grimes (1945) immediately cuts to its tragic chase. The tenor Allan Clayton, as the eponymous fisherman, rolls and flops across the bare stage like a netted halibut in its last gasp of survival. An aerialist tumbles into the deep from a suspended boat, perhaps Grimes, perhaps the boy apprentice who died on his watch. This scene of quiet horror, replacing the usual inquest, is a brilliant opening stroke by director Deborah Warner and her creative team, led by set designer Michael Levine and lighting designer Peter Mumford. Now Grimes relives the courtroom trauma in his waterlogged nightmares. This exceptional co-production, conducted at the ROH by Mark Elder, was first staged at Teatro Real, Madrid, last year. Covid raged then. It rages now, making this an achievement given that a cast of 14 and a large, jostling chorus are required. Some of our greatest singers take the ensemble roles and enhance them. Bryn Terfel, in superb voice, holds the stage as an unusually compassionate Captain Balstrode. John Tomlinson excels as Mr Swallow the tottery, totty-prone lawyer. James Gilchrist soothes as the smoothly supplicating Rector. Catherine Wyn-Rogers (Auntie), Rosie Aldridge (Mrs Sedley), Jacques Imbrailo (Ned Keene) and all the other townsfolk, named or not, manage to be more than caricatures. Individuals each, they are the kind who prune their hedges and go for “sylvan walks” in the words of George Crabbe’s poems of Suffolk life, The Borough (1810), on which Montagu Slater’s libretto is based. When they turn into a faceless mob, out to destroy the misfit Grimes, the shock – and moral truth – is all the more stark. Their bloodcurdling cry of “Peter Grimes”, yelled while smashing an effigy to the ground, shatters every nerve. Clayton, digging deep into the role’s psychology, sang Grimes for the first time professionally in Madrid (after a university try-out 20 years ago). He has the beauty of voice, the versatility and stamina to master every challenge this role throws at him. As hapless visionary, he pitches the high notes of Now the Great Bear and Pleiades with the same ease as did Peter Pears, Britten’s partner who first sang Grimes. Likewise, Clayton snaps into accusatory anger, roaring at his new apprentice (Cruz Fitz, impressively self-possessed) or pushing Ellen Orford (a sympathetic Maria Bengtsson) to the ground, all hope of redemption lost. The ROH orchestra throughout, under Elder’s direction, realises Britten’s score, in all its sonic detail, with vivid passion. The young Britten had especially liked the “musical entr’actes”, as he called them, in Shostakovich’s Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk (1932). He made his own version in the six atmospheric interludes that shape the work’s unusual structure and give a dazzling solo voice to the orchestra. “My bloody opera stinks and that’s all there is to it,” Britten told Pears when he was struggling to finish it. We must be thankful he did. It was a turning point for British opera. Each new staging, including Warner’s, reveals the work’s ever-shifting focus. Who is Grimes? Who bears the guilt? One aspect of this new staging caused unease, the risk of explaining the background to a production where nothing need be said. Britten’s Aldeburgh has been “updated” to a boarded-up coastal town with Ukip tendencies. Jaywick Sands is indicated – in the programme, interviews and background talks – as queasy inspiration. It is “officially” the poorest place in England. Already blighted by “poverty porn” tourism, the Jaywick community will thank no one for being made, in an opera house, an exemplar of mob rule. Peter Grimes is not primarily about poverty, but about the human condition in any time or place. Long after his encounters with Lady Macbeth, in 1960, Britten met Shostakovich. They became friends. Britten especially admired Shostakovich’s 15 string quartets, saying his fellow composer “speaks most closely and most personally in his chamber music”. The Emerson Quartet have performed these works throughout their long career. Founded in 1976, with changes in personnel along the way, the gold-standard American group have announced their forthcoming retirement next year. As part of a long farewell between now and October 2023, they played the first nine Shostakovich quartets at Queen Elizabeth Hall over three evenings. I heard the last, in which No 7, dedicated to his late wife, and No 9, to his then current wife, provided ideal context to the centrepiece, Quartet No 8 in C minor Op 110 (1960). In five movements without a break, this work pushes at the limits of desolation, from skittering anxiety to listless melancholy. Shostakovich, crushed by the Soviet regime and having reluctantly joined the Communist party, wept when he first heard it played. As so often, he uses the musical motto linked to his name (DSCH). The Emerson’s cellist, Paul Watkins, who triggers the first movement, anchored a powerful performance, with warmth, precision and attack, all four musicians sensitive to each detail, uniting as one. There were slips and smudges but the group’s supreme musicality shone throughout. Shostakovich dedicated this quartet to “the victims of fascism and war”, to which nothing need be added. Thanks to some timely programming by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and their game-changing new conductor Vasily Petrenko, the week’s two strands came together on Wednesday. After Britten’s Young Person’s Guide to the Orchestra, written the same year as Grimes and sparklingly played by the RPO, Pablo Ferrández was the incisive, lyrical soloist in Shostakovich’s Cello Concerto No 1: the very work that brought Britten and Shostakovich together, when they shared a box in the Festival Hall at its London premiere. First Petrenko, half Russian, half Ukrainian, spoke of his anguish at the war. and the power of music to unite. “But to play music, we need peace.” The concert ended with William Walton’s mighty Symphony No 1, its noisy finale bursting out in exuberant cacophony: not exactly peace but humankind at its most harmonious and courageously free.

3/26/2022,"Protests are taking place at UK ports over the sacking of hundreds of seafarers, as calls grow for a P&O Ferries’ boss to quit. The demonstrations come after a ship operated by the ferry firm was detained for being “unfit to sail”. The European Causeway has been held at the port of Larne in Northern Ireland. The vessel is one of two that run from Larne and Cairnryan, Scotland. However, sailings remain suspended after the company’s decision to sack 800 seafarers and replace them with cheaper agency workers. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said the ship had been detained due to “failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training”, while the transport secretary Grant Shapps said he would not compromise the safety of P&O vessels. The MCA said: “We can confirm that the European Causeway has been detained in Larne. It has been detained due to failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training. “The vessel will remain under detention until all these issues are resolved by P&O Ferries. Only then will it be reinspected.” The MCA confirmed there were no passengers or freight on board the European Causeway when it was detained. The vessel first entered service in 2000 replacing the Pride of Rathlin, according to the P&O Ferries website. Meanwhile, Shapps tweeted: “Following my instruction to inspect all P&O vessels prior to entering back into service, the MCA-Media has detained a ship for being unfit to sail. “I will not compromise the safety of these vessels and P&O will not be able to rush inexperienced crew through training.” P&O Ferries informed customers on social media that services between Larne and Cairnryan were suspended. The company said: “It is no longer possible for us to arrange travel via an alternative operator on this route. For essential travel, customers are advised to seek alternatives themselves.” The latest development in the crisis came as protests were planned for Saturday by the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union in Liverpool, Hull and Dover against P&O’s actions. The RMT’s general secretary Mick Lynch called for the government to seize P&O’s entire fleet of ships and for crew, who were sacked without being consulted or given any notice, to be reinstated. “The seizing of the European Causeway by the MCA tonight shows that the gangster capitalist outfit P&O are not fit and proper to run a safe service after the jobs massacre,” he said. “This mob should be barred, their ships impounded and the sacked crews reinstated to get these crucial ferry routes back running safely.” Labour’s shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, called for the sacked workers to be reinstated and for P&O Ferries’ chief executive, Peter Hebblethwaite, to be “barred” as a director. She wrote on Twitter: “The trained, experienced, loyal crew should be reinstated. And the Chief Executive should be barred as a director. The shameful misconduct of P&O Ferries has ruined livelihoods, and is harming the UK’s key shipping routes.” Labour has written to the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, asking whether the government will seek the removal of Hebblethwaite as a director under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, PA Media reported. In a letter, the party accused the government of “sitting on their hands” instead of taking action to hold P&O to account, adding that the “toothless response risks giving the green light to exploitation”. Boris Johnson has also backed Shapps’ call for Hebblethwaite to step down.",News/Business,Protests at UK ports as calls grow for P&O Ferries boss to quit,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/26/protests-at-uk-ports-as-calls-grow-for-po-ferries-boss-to-quit
