3/26/2022,"Agood caesar salad is an important part of any cook’s repertoire, but such an iconic dish needs a twist to make it your own. Today I’m sharing a plant-based version from my cookbook Eating for Pleasure, People & Planet that’s made with a variety of nutritious bitter leaves instead of the rather dull traditional iceberg lettuce, some seaweed and salty capers to give it a hint of the sea as an alternative to anchovies, and grated walnuts to replace the parmesan in the original. The real hero ingredient, however, is that lowly by-product aquafaba, or bean cooking water, which makes great mayonnaise and an even better caesar dressing. This is one of the most popular recipes in Eating for Pleasure, People & Planet. The aquafaba caesar dressing gives it a seriously silky, rich and unctuous texture that really hits the spot. Leafy greens (white, red, pink and purple ones alike) keep us going through the coldest months of the year with nutritious, colourful and flavourful ingredients that can withstand seriously cold temperatures, making them a good source of nutrition, including vitamins A and C and minerals in the form of iron, potassium and calcium. Market gardens and specialist farmers are now growing more and more varieties, from old heritage species to new colourful hybrids, including variegated purple and green kale, magenta-coloured fingers of tardivo and radicchio la rosa del Veneto, a frilly, pastel-pink chicory. Experiment with different seasonal greens to personalise your salads. And what better way to use up stale bread than by making croutons? Save energy by frying them over a medium-low heat, rather than blasting them in the oven.

Put the aquafaba, garlic, capers and nutritional yeast, if using, in a food processor and blitz until smooth. With the motor running, pour in extra-virgin olive oil in a very slow, steady stream, just as you would when making mayonnaise , until the mix emulsifies and takes on the consistency of double cream. Blend in the lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce, then set aside. To make the crouutons, mix the garlic and extra-virgin olive oil in a bowl. Add the bread batons, turn them in the garlicky oil until well coated, then season generously with salt. Set a frying pan over a medium-low heat and fry the bread, turning occasionally, until golden brown all over, then take off the heat and set aside to cool. To assemble the salad, mix the leaves, seaweed, croutons and capers in a bowl, drizzle over the dressing and turn just once or twice so the bright colours of the leaves shine through.

3/26/2022,"Amazon, eBay and Wish have stopped stocking some monitors that let people keep track of their blood oxygen levels after an investigation found they were not fit to be sold. The online marketplaces removed a number of pulse oxygen testing devices known as oximeters from sale after being alerted to flaws identified by the consumer organisation Which? Pulse oximeters have boomed in popularity as a result of Covid, with millions of people keeping one at home so they can quickly assess if their blood oxygen level has fallen worryingly low – a condition known as “silent hypoxia” – which is a common side-effect of the disease. Some of the devices were not legally fit to be sold in the UK, did not carry the CE quality Kitemark or wrongly claimed that they had been approved by the NHS. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it would look into the unauthorised use of the health service’s iconic blue and white branding on the devices. It made clear that “the NHS does not approve or endorse any medical devices, including oximeters”. “The department strictly controls the NHS identity and takes unauthorised use or adaptation of the NHS logo and the letters ‘NHS’ very seriously”, a DHSC spokesperson said. Which? said that 11 of the cheap pulse oximeters it bought from those websites failed to comply with UK and European Union law when it examined them closely. Some cost as little as 99p. It urged consumers to look for properly approved devices in the “lottery” of selecting the right one. “It is very concerning that our investigation found these medical devices for sale without the required safety markings or brazenly claiming to be approved by the NHS, and the biggest online marketplaces were not picking up on these red flags”, said Natalie Hitchens, the consumer group’s head of home products and services. For example, the £12.99 Bee Smart pulse oximeter, bought from Amazon, did not contain any contact details for who had made it or for a UK/EU representative. It also lacked a four-digit code to show that it had been assessed by a notified body, which is required of all medical devices before they go on sale in Britain. Amazon, eBay and Wish removed the items from sale after being warned about them. “Pulse oximeters can be useful devices for patients to self-monitor their blood oxygen levels, and they have been a key piece of equipment during the pandemic to help healthcare professionals manage patients with Covid or post-Covid syndrome to ensure they receive the appropriate treatment”, said Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs. “However, even though pulse oximeters are affordable and easy to use, they are medical devices that may have an impact on a patient’s health and treatment plan. So it’s important that if patients are purchasing one, they ensure they buy verified products from trusted retailers – and that these retailers ensure they are only selling verified products – to ensure products are safe to use and provide accurate readings.”",News/World news,Online retailers stop sales of some blood oxygen monitors after investigation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/26/online-retailers-stop-sales-of-some-blood-oxygen-monitors-after-investigation
3/26/2022,"The master of a Cambridge University college at the centre of a dispute over a memorial to a benefactor who was involved in the slave trade has described a recent judgment by a church court that it should remain in the college chapel as “astonishing”. Jesus College applied to the Diocese of Ely to remove the memorial to its 17th-century benefactor, Tobias Rustat, whose links with slavery are universally accepted, and put it on display in another site in the college. They argued that its presence was having a negative impact on the mission and ministry of the church. Speaking to the Guardian after losing the case, Sonita Alleyne, the master of Jesus College, said the decision was a profound moment for the Church of England, which has apologised for its own links to the transatlantic slave trade. “It’s the first test for the church,” she said, “a church which in the 17th century owned slaves.” It is a test the church appears to have failed. “It’s a church which is saying to black people: you’ve got to put up and shut up and pray under a memorial to a slave trader,” said Alleyne. “It’s very, very disappointing. How could they get to that decision?” Alleyne, who was the first black master of an Oxbridge college and is the first woman to lead Jesus College since its foundation in 1496, was born in Bridgetown, Barbados, and brought up in Leytonstone, east London, a Seventh Day Adventist. Her sense of disbelief at the ruling is audible. “There is such a thing as racial dignity in worship. That’s a thing that has been ignored. “The memorial to someone who invested in wholesale murder, death, slavery, torture – that’s more important than that feeling of being able to be in a church in a comfortable way? And if we don’t like it we just have to suck it up or don’t come in? “The Church of England sits at the heart of the Anglican communion across the world. The average Anglican is a 30-year-old African woman. What are we really saying with this judgment?” Since Alleyne took up her role as the 41st master of Jesus College in October 2019, she has led the college not only through a pandemic but also during a process of critical self-reflection as it examines the long-term legacies of slavery and colonial violence. Her personal message about the killing of George Floyd received widespread attention, as did the return of a looted Benin bronze cockerel to delegates from Nigeria. Her tenure has also coincided with growing diversity at Cambridge University. The 2020 cohort at Jesus College was described as “the most diverse in history” with more than four in five students from state schools and colleges, and one in three students of colour. She is also keen to highlight her work developing better career support for students, so it’s not just about getting into Cambridge and leaving with a good degree, but also about finding a rewarding career and improving social mobility, especially for the most disadvantaged. To that end she has encouraged entrepreneurship, mentoring, speed networking, career talks, internships and work experience opportunities, particularly in the creative industries where she made her name, founding the production company Somethin’ Else, which she led until 2009. Alleyne also wants to encourage members of the college to make a difference in the wider Cambridge community, particularly the neighbouring Abbey ward, which scores highly on all indices of social deprivation, and she is a patron of Red Hen, a charity that supports local primary schoolchildren and their families. However, for better or worse, the disagreement surrounding the Rustat memorial has gained her the most column inches. The ruling on Wednesday that the Rustat memorial should remain in the chapel followed resistance from a group of 70 college alumni, who opposed the plan for its removal, arguing that the one-time courtier to Charles II had been misrepresented. The judgment agreed with them that the opposition to the ornate memorial stone, designed by Grinling Gibbons, was based on “a false narrative” about the scale of the financial rewards Rustat gained from slavery. It found that Rustat’s investments in the slave trading Royal Adventurers brought him no financial returns at all, while his investments in the Royal African Company were not realised until 20 years after he had made his gifts to the college. Alleyne argued that meticulous research had revealed Rustat was “heavily involved”, to the same level as Edward Colston, whose statue was toppled in Bristol in 2020, and she was shocked that the fact that he was less successful as a slave trader was used in the judgment to help justify leaving the memorial in place. “He didn’t get any dividends, but he was sat in meetings. He knew how many people had been lost at sea, how much cargo had been lost. That is a real investor in the transatlantic slave trade, in one of the most successful companies. People died. People were branded. People were raped. People were worked to death.” The judgment came as a surprise to many, after the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, came out in support of removing the memorial, urging the church to change its practices. Alleyne expressed anger that having contested and lost the case, the increasingly diverse community at Jesus were now expected to go back into the chapel and get on with it, in the shadow of a slave-trader’s memorial. “This is quite a monumental moment – this was the church’s moment of reparation for its past involvement in the slave trade,” she said. “This is not acceptable. It’s offensive. It’s like saying to Rosa Parks: you’ve had your fun. Now you get to the back of the bus. It’s nonsense. “This is people not in the community now making judgments over what the community is about now and what young people are about now. We can’t believe this has been the outcome.” The college is considering whether to seek leave to appeal. Meanwhile, Alleyne, a graduate of Fitzwilliam College in Cambridge, finds herself reluctant to enter the chapel at all and will consider staging official events that would normally be in the chapel – such as the awarding of scholarships – elsewhere. “It’s the church. The church is meant to love us all. You can’t just say you love us. You’ve got to show it. The idea that you would just say: put up and shut up and get on with it now … We don’t just have to accept that from the church. “It’s just not right. What does that judgment say? They are basically saying: if you don’t want to come in then just go, and don’t come in, because it doesn’t matter.”",News/Education,‘We can’t believe it’: Cambridge college master aghast as slave trader plaque stays,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/26/cambridge-college-master-sonita-alleyne-aghast-tobias-rustat-plaque

3/26/2022,"Western brands have swiftly moved to shut down operations in Russia since the invasion of Ukraine, wiping well-known goods from the shelves. But what does it feel like for those trying to run businesses in the country? The Russian partner of one western brand shares their story. “To say I have concerns about the future is a huge understatement. Waking up every day with the knowledge that you are an unwilling part of this nightmare is devastating. “I have been building my business for decades, and now I am watching it fall apart. I have people depending on me – not just my family, but my employees, who will lose their source of income, their health insurance, their livelihood. One of my biggest concerns is their welfare. But of course, compared with the tragedy that’s happening in Ukraine, all business concerns seem insignificant. “As of this moment, retail businesses are still functioning – but the biggest question we all have is what will happen in a few weeks or months, when supplies run out. “The big brands that operate in Russia themselves, like Ikea and Inditex [the owner of fashion chain Zara], have a bit more freedom – they can afford to temporarily suspend operations while continuing to pay their employees. “The businesses that work under a licence agreement are facing much tougher challenges. I fear we will all have to make a difficult, strategic choice – whether to close our businesses permanently and sell off our remaining stocks, or try to keep the business afloat in the hope that the situation improves and supplies can be resumed. “The first scenario presumes selling off the stock quickly in an attempt to salvage some of our investments, and maybe try to start a new business with that. The second scenario is more hopeful, but it would still involve shutting down some [sites] and letting go of employees. “The biggest risk of all, of course, is that this second scenario presumes the return of our western partners. If that doesn’t happen, then we risk losing everything and being left with nothing. “At this point in time, I am working with the second scenario and hoping that things will get back to normal. But I also know a lot of people who have already shut down their businesses. “The only thing that might be considered an upside is that our sales went up, because people realise that stocks will run out. But it inevitably speeds up the timeline for my chosen scenario, which means our supplies might run out before normal trade relations resume. “Obviously, there are a lot of issues that businesses with western partners face right now – such as logistics and payments [in the light of sanctions on banks and payment of Russian companies]. But the decision to suspend operations in Russia was for many brands a political one as much as an operational one. Personally, I am constantly in touch with my partners in Europe, and they have been very supporting. “We are still able to pay staff in Russia, but we are going to have to shut selected shops at some point soon, as stocks dwindle, and pay the affected employees severance pay. “I know quite a few people who were forced to shut down their businesses, sell off their remaining stock and have either left Russia already or are planning to leave soon. “Of course [our customers and staff] feel let down to an extent, because with many brands suspending their operations, tens of thousands of people are at risk of losing their jobs, their source of income, their access to medical care. “They simply don’t know what’s going to happen, whether they’ll be able to pay rent, pay off their credit card debt, provide for their families. I don’t think people are scared of the fact that the products they are used to won’t be available per se, I think they’re scared of not having a choice any more.”",News/Business,‘I am watching my business fall apart’ – Can retailers survive inside Putin’s Russia?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/26/russia-retailers-putin-sanctions-ukraine

3/26/2022,"There are new colours flying from the flagpole on Castleberg Crag in Settle: summer-sky blue and sunflower yellow. I see them everywhere now: hyacinths and daffodils outside the supermarket; black-faced sheep on Warrendale Knotts with blue and yellow smit marks, the combination no less powerful even where it is unintentional. The woodland adjacent to Castleberg is a scene of devastation, wreaked by a different kind of airstrike. It’s the same all over the high dales – the winter has taken an astonishing toll on the most statuesque trees, with dieback-afflicted ash and shallow-rooted beech the worst affected. Many have been sectioned and stacked alongside roads and bridleways. Others lie where they fell, and I walk their lengths, paying respects. There are old farmers here who have never seen such winds, I’m told. The worst came, unusually, from the north, so trees that have stood firm against prevailing gales found themselves stressed in unfamiliar ways. Post-Covid, I can relate to that. I’m grateful for the vaccines that primed my immune system, but I’m still taking time to recover. Hills are a challenge, so I pick routes carefully, contouring, following the lines of drystone walls. Some have fallen under toppled trees, but will be reassembled using only what is to hand. They make me think about resilience, and how we will find enough of that as political, meteorological and epidemiological storms keep coming. I go to a place that I think might have some answers. They call them scars – limestone pavements, crags and clefts, places where the Earth shows its bones. Attermire Scar, Yew Cogar Scar, Loup Scar, Great Scar, and this one, Gordale. A scar looks like damage, but it means healing. The characteristic vegetation on the most challenging parts of the scars, their exposed vertical faces, is yew – slow-grown, long-lived, winter-green: offering shelter and sustenance, but also poison. They know a thing or two about resilience these old ones, but also about resistance. They show me how they hold tight with their roots to what is most sure and certain, but open their branches to all that life throws at them as it passes by. As darkness falls they whisper that poison, in the right dose, can be a cure.
