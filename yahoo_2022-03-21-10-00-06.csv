He had no medication or proper bandages, and Russian soldiers with guns told him they would help. His wife said it was ""awful"" to have them there, but she needed supplies for her husband. Eduard Lysovysk spent days in a crowded bomb shelter with his thigh bone smashed by Russian bullets, and the only treatment was a makeshift splint. Two days after the construction worker was wounded and he lay immobile in a bomb shelter, he was visited by Russian soldiers wielding guns, who told him they had ""come to protect him,"" The Guardian report. Lysovysk was shot on March 4 by Russian soldiers as he attempted to get his wife and elderly neighbor out of their apartment building in Hostomel, a town neighboring a cargo airbase that Russia tried to seize on the first day of the invasion. Lysovysk's wife Iryna told The Guardian that it felt ""awful"" to have the soldiers at her husband's sickbed. But with her husband's mangled leg bound together with a makeshift splint and torn bedsheets, with no painkillers available to him, she had to seek assistance begrudgingly. She told the soldiers, ""We have been injured and need things like blankets and duvets."" She was briefly allowed to return to the couple's home, which she told The Guardian was occupied by ten Russian officers. A Russian medic changed her husband's bandages, administered one antibiotic dose, and left. Lysovysk told the newspaper that the Russian soldiers insisted Ukrainian snipers injured him. ""I had seen the (Russian) sniper eye to eye, 20m away from us. He was in the next apartment block over, the construction block,"" he told The Guardian. Lysovysk finally managed to escape six days after being shot and is now in a hospital south of Kyiv and faces complex surgery to regain the use of his leg, said The Guardian.

 Russian officials reportedly confirmed Sunday that a navy commander has been killed amid the fighting in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. In a statement through the online messaging service Telegram, the Russian-installed governor of the occupied city of Sevastopol confirmed Andrei Paly's death, according to Radio Free Europe's Russia service. Razvozhayev, 51, was the deputy commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet. Razvozhayev's death was also confirmed by Nakhimov naval college secretary Konstantin Tsarenko, via the Vkontakte social network, according to the BBC. Ukrainian officials have reported that five high-ranking officers within the Russian army have been killed since the country began its invasion of Ukraine last month, though only one has been confirmed by Moscow. An advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that Russia army commander Lt. Gen. Andrei Mordvichev was killed in an airfield near the city of Kherson. Western intelligence estimates place the number of Russian troops killed or injured at up to 1,000 a day, according to The Washington Post. Russia has intensified attacks on civilian targets in the past week, while the U.S. has also warned of Moscow potentially using chemical weapons. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Sunday said the use of more devastating weapons in Ukraine is a sign of Russian President Vladimir Putin attempting to ""reestablish some momentum"" amid reports that Moscow's invasion has stalled.",World/The Hill,Russian navy commander killed in Mariupol fighting,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-navy-commander-killed-mariupol-215941462.html
3/21/2022,"A rising number of law enforcement agencies are opting not to share statistics about hate crimes with the FBI — just as hate crimes are skyrocketing, according to U.S. Justice Department numbers. The big picture: The decline in reporting hurts efforts to accurately document violence against Asian Americans, Black Americans, and LGBTQ+ people, advocates and DOJ officials say. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free Details: The number of police agencies participating in the FBI’s hate crimes report declined in 2020 — the third straight year of decreases. About 88% of cities don't report hate crimes data. More than 12,000 law enforcement agencies reported zero hate crimes FBI numbers showed. The list includes police departments in Miami, Little Rock, Arkansas, and Huntsville, Alabama. Just a handful of cities and towns in states like Alabama, Arkansas, and Florida bothered to report hate crimes in 2020, an analysis of data by Axios found. By the numbers: In 2020, the number of hate crimes reported nationwide spiked to the highest level in nearly two decades. More than 60% of reported hate crimes were motivated by race and ethnicity and, of those, more than half targeted Black Americans, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. The FBI hasn't reported its statistics yet for 2021, but a new study found that reports of hate crimes skyrocketed again last year in more than a dozen of America’s largest cities, with a record number of Asian Americans saying they were targeted, The unpublished study by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino found that hate crimes surged 46% from the previous year across 14 major metro areas. What they're saying: ""This lack of accurate hate crimes data not only makes it harder for law enforcement to address and prevent hate crimes, but also can cause individuals and communities victimized by acts of hate to believe that law enforcement agencies are not responding to their experiences,"" Clarke testified. ""Accurate and complete data reporting is needed to ensure that resources deployed match the most pressing needs in our communities."" The other side: Submitting hate crime data is voluntary, and some cities, including Los Angeles and New York, have improved their reporting, Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, California State University, told Axios. Yes, but: The disparity in reporting makes it appear that Los Angeles is a city filled with hate crimes while Miami is safe from hate, Levin said: ""Go ask a gay person in Miami if they think that's true."" Levin said Miami police need to start participating regularly and Congress needs to consider legislation that would tie federal grants to hate crimes reporting. The Miami Police Department did not return emails or phone messages. Gene Voegtlin, policy and governance director at the International Association of Chiefs of Police, said the group did not have anyone to comment for this story. Don't forget: The most diverse set of attorneys general in the nation's history are pushing a campaign against hate crimes while they face hateful rhetoric and threats themselves. Washington, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, a Haitian immigrant, is urging all attorneys general to use their influence to draw attention to the spike in hate crimes and advocate for changing laws locally and nationally.

3/21/2022,"A shocking series of events led to the discovery of Jeannette DePalma’s body in the woods where it had been “left to rot,” but the teen’s suspected murder remains shrouded in mystery 50 years later. On Sept. 19, 1972, a dog returned from a frolic in a wooded area with an object in its mouth, and started “playing with it” on the lawn of a nearby apartment building in Springfield, New Jersey. Moments later, the pet’s owner went to inspect what appeared to be a “large bone” and screamed when she realized it was “a human arm,” according to police reports obtained by The Daily Beast. The Springfield Police Department was called to the scene, and attending officers later recounted what they saw upon arriving at the woman’s home. “She took me to the rear door of her apartment and in a bluish bag she handed me the arm of a female,” Officer J. Schwerdt said in the report. “The lower left arm. On the fingernails was a whitish nail polish.” Jeanette DePalma, inset, and clippings of the media coverage of her suspected murder. Search parties then scoured the Houdaille Quarry behind the residential building. It wasn’t long before they stumbled across an “upper arm bone” and then the rest of the corpse, face down and fully clothed in a small clearing on top of a steep hill. “Around the body were logs across the head down the right side and a small branch under both feet,” Schwerdt stated in the report. Chief Medical Examiner Bernard Ehrenberg was also called to the scene where he pronounced the girl, who was unidentified at the time, dead. Dental records later confirmed that the body belonged to 16-year-old local high school student, Jeannette DePalma, who had been reported missing by her mother six weeks earlier. “She was found… lying face down with a rock formation surrounding her body,” Ehrenberg wrote in his medical examiner’s report. He determined that an autopsy could not be performed because of the “marked state” of decomposition. For this same reason, a cause of death could not be determined so was listed as “suspicious” rather than as a homicide. A skeletal examination and X-Rays showed that the body revealed no evidence of bullet holes, fractures or traumatic injury, according to the report. The case remains unsolved today. But one theory that dominated initial media coverage has lingered for decades after rumors circulated that DePalma’s body was found surrounded by sticks that had been formed into the outline of crosses and a coffin. News headlines about the investigation into DePalma’s death screamed: “Murder probe sheds light on witchcraft cult” and “Jersey murder probe throws light on witchcraft.” Little Sister of Murdered Girl Hunts for Her Killer 25 Years After Horrific Death The Associated Press reported at the time that “authorities said Jeannette’s death may be linked to a ‘coven’ or witchcraft assembly thought to exist in the area.” Then-Springfield Police Chief George Parsell was quoted in the article as saying: “I heard that some people from the department supposedly brought a witch out there (to help with the investigation) but I know nothing about it,” he said. There were also reports of devil worship, with locals sharing stories about children holding seances, praying to Satan and sacrificing chickens, pigeons, and an occasional goat in the park around the nearby Watchung Reservation. And then there was the name of the cliff where DePalma’s body was found: Devil’s Teeth. Reverend James Tate, the pastor of the church DePalma attended, told reporters he believed satanists captured and killed the teen because of her faith. “She was so religious that she would often talk to friends and acquaintances about God,” he said at the time. He claimed that she had tried to lecture devil worshippers about Christ, and “their fanaticism arose and they killed her” but conceded his theory was based on no more than a personal belief. However, it’s one that has been shared by many others too. Jeanette DePalma’s death was linked to claims of witchcraft and Satan worshipping. Edward Salzano, now 59, grew up around Springfield and also believes “an evil group of satanists killed Jeannette.” Salzano was a close friend of DePalma’s nephew John Blancey—who lived with his aunt at the time of her death, according to Freedom of Information documents obtained by The Daily Beast. He said the pair took it upon themselves to try and solve the case when it appeared police had reached a dead end. Blancey died about four years ago, which made Salzano even more determined to uncover the truth about what really happened to DePalma, despite having never met her. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Salzano said he has spoken to many of DePalma’s friends, family members and acquaintances, as part of his independent investigation into her death over the last eight years. And, according to him, there’s one common thread: “They’re all scared to death,” he said. Of what, he says he doesn’t know, but Salzano insists there’s a “gigantic coverup” and that almost everyone he has spoken to with knowledge about the case or DePalma shares his belief that “a satanic cult targeted Jeannette and killed her.” He said DePalma was a “devout Christian” who “would preach to the other people about leaving satanism and witchcraft behind.” He believes this made her a target and even has an unverified theory about the timing of DePalma’s death. “The lore is there,” he said. “They wanted to kill someone—a child—for Halloween and that’s what they did.” Salzano also claims he developed a relationship with the last person to see DePalma alive—one of her girlfriends who has since died—and who he believes was involved in the cult, and possibly her friend’s death. “She would call me in the middle of the night,” he said. “One thing she never stopped talking about was the satanic cult. “(Jeannette) was set up.” For years, rumors swirled around Springfield about other possible suspects: a transient who worked nearby; a watchman; and a guy who drove a red Ford, among others. But police couldn’t find anything to connect these people to the crime. There was even speculation that her death was the work of a serial killer. A New Jersey State Police investigation report obtained by The Daily Beast shows that officials explored the possibility that DePalma was the victim of a potential serial killer by comparing her case to four other murders in the area but ultimately found they had “no similarities.” Investigators also looked into the possibility of an accidental drug overdose or suicide but also found no evidence to support either theory. Leads in DePalma’s case eventually dried up and the case went cold until a letter to the editors of Weird New Jersey, a magazine devoted to local folklore and legends, revived interest in DePalma’s death in 1997. Then in 2015, authors Jesse P. Pollack and Mark Moran released a book on the case, Death on the Devil’s Teeth: The Strange Murder That Shocked Suburban New Jersey and presented theories but no concrete answers about what happened to DePalma. In 2019, the writers obtained a case file with photos of the body, which cast doubt on the cult theory. An expert in satanic imagery said that the arrangements of rocks, sticks, and logs appear to be naturally placed and not the work of devil worshippers. ‘Little Miss Nobody’ Identified as 1960 Kidnap Victim Springfield Police Chief John Cook told The Daily Beast the case had not received any new evidence. “What I can say on this case right now is that it is still an active case of a suspicious death, as there has not been any evidence, as of yet, to be able to officially rule it a homicide,” he said. Salzano—who unsuccessfully sued the Union County Prosecutor’s Office in hopes of compelling the agency to test DePalma’s clothing and fingernail scrapings for DNA—believes there’s only one way to get to the bottom of who killed DePalma. “We need to establish a cause of death by making the X-Rays public… and (advanced) DNA testing needs to be done,” he told The Daily Beast. “We’ve heard everything (about how she died) from strangulation, to being shot with an arrow, to being bashed in the head. “An independent body other than the county’s office needs to go over it.” Today, a Facebook page—Justice for Jeannette DePalma—run by Salzano and his partner is dedicated to keeping her memory alive and seeking answers. “The major reason her murder cannot be investigated and solved is there is no determined cause of death, so her case is still ruled a ‘suspicious death,’” Salzano said. “This horrible murder will never be solved until this first step is taken. “Jeannette had just turned 16 and was a sweet, loving person who believed in God and was brutally murdered and left in the woods to rot… and we want Justice for Jeannette DePalma before its to0 late.” Springfield’s deputy mayor Chris Weber, who is also a retired Newark Police Officer and detective, said he’s spoken with the Springfield Police Chief Cook about taking another look into DePalma’s case. According to Weber, Cook was receptive and “wants this case solved also.” “A set of new eyes and a fresh perspective always helps either confirm or question case information,” he told The Daily Beast. “I don't think this was the perfect crime. Somewhere, something, some connection is out there waiting to be found and that will be the break in the case.” Weber said there is still interest among locals to find answers to what happened to DePalma. “Over the past few years of being a township official, I have had several people ask me about the case,” Weber said. “They always have interest in it or they have a remembrance of the time it happened and some of the stories they heard over the years.” “I believe any law enforcement officer would have the same desire to be able to have a case, as important as this one, finally solved. That’s why we become cops.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.

3/21/2022,"March 19 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin is healthy, sane and ""in better shape than ever"", his close ally Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko has said in an interview with the Japanese television channel TBS. ""He and I haven't only met as heads of state, we're on friendly terms,"" Lukashenko said in a recording of the interview shared by state news agency BelTA. ""I'm absolutely privy to all his details, as far as possible, both state and personal."" Russia used Belarusian territory as a staging post for its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Western leaders have suggested Putin made a costly miscalculation by launching the military assault on Ukraine, where Russian forces have taken heavy losses and their advance has largely stalled despite their apparent superiority. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested Putin is being ""irrational"" and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has described him as ""totally paranoid"". But Lukashenko dismissed the notion that Putin, who is 69, was not at the height of his powers. ""The West, and you, should get this stupidity, this fiction out of your heads,"" he told the interviewer. ""Putin is absolutely fit, he's in better shape than ever ... This is a completely sane, healthy person, physically healthy - he's an athlete."" ""As they say here - he'll catch a cold at all our funerals."" Lukashenko also bemoaned the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. The theme is one Putin has frequently discussed, not least when he suggested in speeches before the invasion that Ukraine was an artificial construct and an ""inalienable part"" of Russian history and culture. ""The collapse of the Soviet Union is a tragedy,"" Lukashenko said. ""If the Soviet Union had survived to this day, we could have avoided all sorts of conflicts in the world... ""While the USSR existed, the world was multipolar and one pole balanced the other,"" he said. ""Now the reason for what's happening in the world is unipolarity - the monopolisation of our planet by the United States of America.""
