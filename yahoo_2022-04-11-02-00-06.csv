4/11/2022,"ALI Technologies, the maker of the XTURISMO bike, is mulling a stock market listing, per Bloomberg. The company began accepting pre-orders for its XTURISMO in October. The bike, which reaches a height of two metres, is ideal for the Middle East's desert terrain. The Japanese startup behind a $777,000 flying motorbike is planning to float on the stock exchange through an IPO to raise further funds, according to Bloomberg. Daisuke Katano, the CEO of Tokyo-based ALI Technologies, which designed the bike, named XTURISMO, told Bloomberg that the company was planning to list the company on the Mothers market for startups. Katano also said the company was in negotiations to float on the Tokyo Stock Exchange but declined to provide a timeframe or potential target valuation for an IPO. The 300-kilogram XTURISMO bike, which according to the company's website has a top speed of 80 kilometres per hour with a travel range of up to 40 minutes, launched for pre-orders in October last year, Insider's Grace Dean reported. In January, the Robb Report reported that the company had begun taking deposits for the bike, which can reach a height of 2 metres (6.6 feet) in three seconds. The vehicle made headlines in Japan in March when it featured in the opening ceremony of a baseball match in Hokkaido. —Farm To Fame (@FarmToFame_) March 29, 2022 Katano told Bloomberg the vehicles were garnering interest in the Middle East, where the desert terrain complemented the hovering nature of the bikes.

4/11/2022,"BEAUMONT, Texas — Seven inmates have been charged with killing two fellow prisoners and wounding two others during a January attack at a federal prison in Texas that led to a nationwide lockdown of the federal prison system. The 15-count indictment filed last week includes charges of racketeering, murder and attempted murder against Juan Carolos Rivas-Moreiera; Dimas Alfaro-Granados; Raul Landaverde-Giron; Larry Navarete; Jorge Parada; Hector Ramires; and Sergio Sibrian. The seven remain in federal custody and court documents do not list attorneys who could speak on their behalf. The Jan. 31 attack was inside USP Beaumont in Beaumont, Texas. Prosecutors say the seven are members of the violent MS-13 gang and attacked rival gang members of the Mexican Mafia and its affiliate, the Sureños. ""Deterring prison violence remains a priority for the Department,"" U.S. Attorney Brit Featherston of the Eastern District of Texas said in a statement Thursday. ""Any prisoner who causes physical injury to another, inmate or corrections officer, will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."" Archives: How US foreign policy in Central America may have fueled the migrant crisis Each of the seven could face the death penalty if convicted on the murder charges, the indictment states. According to the indictment, the MS-13 maintained a relationship with the Mexican Mafia and Sureños for protection in prisons. ""However, that symbiotic relationship recently began to fall apart as MS-13's leadership in El Salvador sought to exert more control and independence of its own members while incarcerated in prisons within the United States,"" the indictment stated.
