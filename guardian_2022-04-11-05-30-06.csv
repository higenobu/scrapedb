4/11/2022,"Ukraine’s economy is on course to contract by almost half this year as the Russian invasion and the impact of a “deep humanitarian crisis” takes its toll, the World Bank has said. With a blockade of Black Sea ports in the south of Ukraine and the havoc caused to industry in the east, the war-torn country’s GDP is projected to shrink by about 45% in 2022. The Washington-based development organisation said Russia would also fall into recession and many countries surrounding Ukraine would suffer severe hardship, with some pushed to seek outside help from international agencies to prevent them defaulting on existing debts. “The war is having a devastating impact on human life and causing economic destruction in both countries, and will lead to significant economic losses in the Europe and central Asia region and the rest of the world,” the World Bank said in its forecast published on Sunday. The Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will host finance ministers and central bank bosses at their annual spring meetings this week. David Malpass, the president of the World Bank, and the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, are expected to say they plan to offer extra financial support to countries affected by the invasion, many of which are suffering spiralling food costs. Last month, Georgieva said it was unlikely the war would trigger a global financial crisis, but warned of a severe recession in many countries close to the conflict. The Bank said the second major shock in two years, after the pandemic, would lead to a 4.1% decline in economic output across the region – twice as steep as the recession in 2020 from the Covid-19 crisis. The World Bank’s Europe and central Asia regional data stretches from Ireland in the west to the Russian Federation in the east, but the report focused on emerging and developing countries in central and eastern Europe, the Balkans, Turkey and the former Soviet republics. It said the ripple effects of the war would hit many of the former Soviet republics hardest and many would be forced to seek further loans from the World Bank and the IMF to remain solvent. Lending to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and the Kyrgyz Republic has already increased during the pandemic, the Bank said, though it highlighted Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic as the most vulnerable and in need of further packages of financial support. The Russian Federation economy is forecast to shrink by 11.2% this year, while output among eastern European countries – including Moldova, Belarus and Ukraine – is expected to be dragged 30.7% lower. Ukraine’s economy, which depends heavily on agriculture, could be hit further if all access to the Black Sea is cut off by Russian forces, the report said. Ukraine’s ports have already suffered a fall in traffic of more than 75% and the capture of Odesa, if it were to happen, could push that figure higher. Sanctions mean that the number of ships arriving in Russian ports is down by almost half since the start of the invasion, leading to a knock-on effect on neighbouring countries that depend on Russian and Ukrainian exports. A decline in remittances – cash sent home by workers living abroad – has also hit the wider region. “The war’s impacts are cascading through the region’s strong trade, financial and migration linkages, resulting in considerable economic damage to neighbouring countries,” the World Bank report said. A continuation of the war would probably force the World Bank to revise its forecasts and predict even larger falls in GDP. It said a downside scenario could include an extra three-percentage-point decline across the euro area in 2022, “reflecting the impact of commodity price shocks from escalation of the war. In turn, this triggers additional sanctions and reduces Russian exports to the euro area. “The downside scenario also assumes a shock to financial confidence, a 20% contraction in Russia’s GDP, and a 75% contraction in Ukraine’s GDP.” Turkey’s economy, which has come under strain from high levels of inflation and rising unemployment, is predicted to grow by 1.4% this year.",News/Business,"Ukraine economy to shrink by almost half this year, World Bank forecasts",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/10/ukraine-economy-gdp-russia-invasion-world-bank-forecast
4/11/2022,"With 67 minutes gone at a breezy Etihad Stadium, on an afternoon that seesawed like a listing ship on a spring tide, Trent Alexander-Arnold could be seen twirling and jinking high up the pitch on the Liverpool right flank, a place he occupied for much of the afternoon. Eventually his cross was cut out by a City foot. Kevin De Bruyne, who produced the perfect through pass for Raheem Sterling to skitter away upfield. Sterling ran the length of Liverpool’s right flank, then stopped, twirled, stopped again, crowded out now by two red shirts. One of these was Alexander-Arnold himself, loping back in that dogged style, with the air even at top speed of a man trotting along the beach with a surf board under one arm. As the ball trickled out of play Alexander-Arnold bent double and clutched his knees, chest heaving, the end of just another instalment in his own thrillingly high-stakes game of risk and reward. By the end of this 2-2 draw Liverpool’s right-sided defensive playmaker had made a goal, almost made quite a few others, passed the ball with wonderful elan, and resembled at other times an open wound on the right, isolated by a well-executed plan from Pep Guardiola. No doubt the entire Alexander-Arnold methodology will be pored over once again. It has become a truism to mutter darkly about his defending, as though in allowing this monster, this defensive refusenik to even take the field Jürgen Klopp is somehow revealing to the world his blindness, his tactical illiteracy. The internet says Alexander‑Arnold can’t defend – and not just that he can’t defend, that his defending is a kind of outrage, a societal toxin. The truth is not just in the middle, but a great deal more interesting. How do you solve a problem like Trent? The answer to this is a blank look, a shrug. What problem, exactly, are we talking about? Better, perhaps, to imagine a Liverpool team where the right‑back sits, covers and blocks up the space. Because the current one, that era-forging Klopp machine, is built to a startling degree around that balance of risk and creativity on the right. It was all on show here in a beautifully open, beautifully flawed game of elite club football, which seemed to centre in so many ways around Liverpool’s right-back. Guardiola deserves credit for taking the game that way. Here City’s manager was up in the first minute prowling his chalk rectangle, discarding his quilted Dalek coat, all the better to revolve his arms in a series of strange geometric shapes, seeing space, angles, intersections, a man trying to grasp the day in his hands. From those early moments City did something simple, playing a series of long, flat, diagonal passes into the space behind Liverpool’s full-backs. By half-time the back four had produced 18 of these. Both City’s first-half goals had come from swift lateral movements, finding that loose, undefined space in the lines between centre-half and full-back. By the end City had made enough chances this way to win the game quite comfortably with competent finishing. They should have scored via this route with four minutes gone, then took the lead moments later, De Bruyne’s shot taking a deflection off Joël Matip. It took 10 minutes for Liverpool to equalise. It was a lovely goal made by Andy Robertson’s delightful chipped pass to the back post, where Alexander-Arnold was in place to provide a velum-bound, goose feather-stuffed touch-off into the path of Diogo Jota, who just had to ease it into the net. It was a finely worked goal. And more than that a moment of pure, luminous Liverpool full-back‑ism, a kind of manifesto goal, a moment that said, yes, we really are going to keep doing this, being entirely ourselves, overloading our own strengths, daring you to plug at our weaknesses. By half-time Liverpool were 2-1 down. City’s passing and movement was thrillingly precise. Close to the pitch you could hear the clips and thuds and pings, like the comforting rat-a-tat of an electric sewing machine stitching the game, the day into place. How to respond, how to close that space on the flanks? How to protect those ailing full-backs? The most interesting part of the game was Klopp’s response. Which was to do: nothing. In fact, to ask for more: more aggression, more vertigo, more and better high-risk full-back play. Less than a minute into the second half Alexander-Arnold was already high up the pitch, funnelling the ball on in one movement to find Mo Salah in space. His cross was pinged high into the net by Sadio Mané. Three times in that second half Alexander-Arnold was the furthest man forward for Liverpool. Just as many he was back covering in extremis. No doubt there will be damning video segments in the post-match playbook, the spotlight of doom. This is of course his role, to move forward, to provide the point of difference, the one real anomaly in this brilliantly constructed systems-team. That looseness is written into his game, not just the freedom, but the obligation to act as a playmaker, a roving brain, a note of creative imagination. Afternoons like this present the paradox of Trent: a player so unusual, so sui generis it still seems inconceivable that Gareth Southgate will find a space for him in his meat-and-potatoes England team; but good enough to come to the home of the champions and provide his own unique notes of illumination.",Sport/Football,Trent Alexander-Arnold paradox gives Klopp’s Liverpool their meaning | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/10/trent-alexander-arnold-paradox-gives-klopps-liverpool-their-meaning
4/11/2022,"The woman who was thrown in jail on a murder charge in Texas for allegedly having caused the “death of an individual by self-induced abortion” has been released after the local district attorney dropped the case. Lizelle Herrera, 26, was reported to be back with her family on Sunday after the district attorney in Rio Grande City, on the US-Mexico border, put out a statement saying he was immediately dismissing the case. Herrera had been arrested last Thursday and placed in the Starr county jail on the back of a grand jury indictment. “The issues surrounding this matter are clearly contentious,” the DA, Gocha Allen Ramirez, said. “However, based on Texas law and the facts presented, it is not a criminal matter.” The prosecutor added: “Ms Herrera did not commit a criminal act under the laws of the state of Texas.” Ramirez’s statement correlates with the view of legal experts and women’s rights advocates who say that Herrera’s arrest should never have happened in the first place. Texas authorities are now likely to face accusations that by putting the woman behind bars they committed an act of gross overreach. “There is no law in Texas that authorizes treating people who have miscarriages, still births or abortions as murderers,” said Lynn Paltrow, executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women. The current law in Texas explicitly exempts women from being policed for any self-managed abortion. The state has attracted considerable attention in recent months after it passed SB 8, legislation that allows private citizens to sue anyone who helps a woman get an abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy. But SB 8 is a civil – not a criminal – provision, and it cannot be applied to the woman receiving the abortion herself. Nonetheless, the abortion ban, which passed all the way up to the US supreme court, has put a chill over Texas. A recent study from the policy evaluation project of the University of Texas at Austin found that between August and December last year, 1,400 women had been forced out of Texas to seek abortion care in other states. The precise details of what happened to Herrera are still unclear, but it appears that the hospital she attended reported her to authorities. In his statement, Ramirez said the Starr County sheriff’s department investigated Herrera after the hospital brought “the incident” to the officers’ attention. Local advocacy groups in southern Texas expressed joy at Herrera’s release, coupled with anger that she had been detained in the first place. South Texans for Reproductive Justice called the dismissal of charges a “bittersweet victory”. The group said: “It should not have taken national attention for these charges to be dismissed.” The confusion over Herrera’s wrongful arrest is an indication of the tensions that are rising in states across the country ahead of a critical ruling by the supreme court on the constitutional right to an abortion framed in Roe v Wade. The court is expected to give its decision in June, and all indications suggest it is likely to rein back abortion rights at least to some degree. Paltrow warned that any move by the supreme court to hand more control over abortion laws to the states would inevitably lead to increased rates of surveillance, reporting and arrests of women. “For the past 50 years, anti-abortion activists have been trying to groom people in the US to view pregnant women as criminals,” she said.",News/US news,Murder charges dropped against Texas woman for ‘self-induced abortion’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/10/texas-woman-murder-charges-dropped-self-induced-abortion
4/11/2022,"Pep Guardiola claimed Manchester City gave Liverpool “a life” by only drawing 2-2 with them, while Jürgen Klopp insisted his team would “not stop chasing” the champions, who remain a point ahead with each having seven matches left. Goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus were cancelled out by Diogo Jota and Sadio Mané at the Etihad Stadium as City overran Liverpool in the first half before the visitors rallied impressively after the break. Guardiola said: “I felt we let them have a life from here but Liverpool are a joy to watch, I know how good they are and there is no doubt about that but I am so proud of my team. I said to the team: ‘I don’t want one second sad.’” Guardiola believes City have to win all of their remaining matches. “We know now that one game and a dropped result, then we will not be champions,” the Catalan said. “Will it be easy? Absolutely not but it will be difficult for them too. “Seven games in the Premier League is a lot [to win] – they are tough games and they have tough games. I don’t know what will happen but the way we performed throughout the season and against this team to perform the way they did – I am proud. I wanted to win but it doesn’t matter. It was so good.” Klopp compared the contest to two heavyweight boxers. “What a game. Wild,” he said. “It was a better start for City. In the first half they had a big chance [to kill Liverpool off] and that is how it is. We can describe it like a boxing fight. Both arms down for a second and you get a massive knock. You can shake it off a bit and then the next knock is coming from the other team. “I liked a lot of things, I thought we were closer than ever. In all the moments that we played football and controlled the game and we played really simple passes, let them run, and then we were really dangerous to them. That is how we scored the goals and the second-half start was much better with the goal and a great football situation. “City really tried to use a couple of things like the balls in behind – I can’t remember them doing it much but today they did. Fine. We don’t own the style, it’s just smart – I couldn’t respect it more. “It’s easy to play the pass but the timing for the run – it’s not bad. We could have done it as well but it’s fine, we improved and it’s about winning games, not which style. It makes sense in moments. I have to watch it back. “I was not convinced but I had the sense we could win this game. When we played, they had problems. They were direct. We were direct but that wasn’t planned. They had more direct ideas than us and we wanted to let them run when we were in possession so it was one thing with this and we were in a rush defending high balls. “We wanted to make sure that they saw my boys are exceptional as well and I saw that today and am really happy about that. Now it is seven games to go for both teams. We will not stop chasing now. That is clear. But we now have two different competitions.” City appear to have the simpler run-in playing Brighton, Watford, Leeds, Newcastle, West Ham and Aston Villa plus a rearranged meeting with Wolves. Liverpool’s schedule takes in Manchester United, Everton, Newcastle, Tottenham, Villa, Southampton and Wolves. In the first half a plane flew over the stadium that trailed a banner that read: “British To Be Minority By 2066.” It may be the subject of an investigation.",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola: Manchester City gave Liverpool ‘a life’ in title race with draw,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/10/pep-guardiola-says-manchester-city-gave-liverpool-a-life
4/11/2022,"Britain’s self-titled money saving expert Martin Lewis has warned that civil unrest over rising energy bills “isn’t far away”, as he repeated his call for more government intervention to protect people. Lewis said he was the most scared he has been for people’s finances since he founded his popular website in 2003. It has traditionally offered advice on which bank accounts or phone providers may be cost-effective, and has been a regular port of call for people looking to switch energy provider and save money. However, after the recent increase in the price cap for household energy bills to £1,971, it took the step of publishing a Heat the Human guide for people on how to keep themselves and their homes warm as they face a choice between heating and putting food on the table. It includes steps like putting hot-water bottles in sleeping bags. “This is one of the richest countries in the world. It’s pretty desperate, isn’t it?” he said. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, he said: “We need to keep people fed. We need to keep them warm. If we get this wrong right now, then we get to the point where we start to risk civil unrest. When breadwinners cannot provide, anger brews and civil unrest brews – and I do not think we are very far off. “I get all these messages from people tearing their hair out. They don’t know how to make things add up.” It echoes his comments to the Guardian in an interview in March, when he said that inflation and rising household costs could plunge more people into absolute poverty. Currently, people will be able to get a £200 discount on their energy bills in October, which will be repayable. Council tax payers living in homes in bands A to D will be eligible to receive a £150 rebate on their council tax bills in April. A further rise for the energy cap is expected in October. It is thought that inflation could reach 8.4% this year, according to an economic outlook report by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Lewis said that he thinks real inflation could even go as high as 12%. If the PwC prediction is borne out, it would mean an overall drop of 2% in household incomes. This would be the biggest decline in wages since the 1970s, and the largest fall in living standards since records began. Lewis added: “For people towards the bottom end, there’s nothing to cut back on. It is not an exaggeration to say that there are people we have to prevent freezing or starving.” The PwC report, published in early April, said that British households were set to be £900 worse off this year in a “historic fall” in living standards. The lowest earners face a £1,300 drop in finances, which could grow even worse if the Russian invasion of Ukraine drags on.",Lifestyle/Money,"Civil unrest due to rising energy bills ‘isn’t far away’, says Martin Lewis",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/10/civil-unrest-due-to-rising-energy-bills-isnt-far-away-says-martin-lewis
