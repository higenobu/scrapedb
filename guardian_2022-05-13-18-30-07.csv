5/13/2022,"If there is a victory in Nathaniel Price’s new play, it takes place in extra time. The 45-minute first half ends in a goalless draw and it looks like we will reach the 90-minute mark in much the same way. We know who deserves to win. It is Clayton James, a footballer whose single-minded devotion to the beautiful game has taken him to the brink of being signed. Played by Raphael Akuwudike, he has the charm of a young man whose aim is true – off the pitch as much as on. But he has a tough adversary. We all know what Coach Lafferty is up to, but he is a master of concealment. The way Arthur Wilson plays him, you would think he was everyone’s best friend. Only occasionally does he reveal his menacing core, the controlling instinct beneath the personable exterior. He is a serial abuser, hiding in plain sight. The playwright himself was once signed to a major-league academy, happily without incident, although recent scandals have highlighted the risks. The strength of his play, set in the late 1970s, is in its observation of the innocuous pace at which grooming happens – a compliment here, a promise there, now a veiled threat, now an ambiguous gesture. Lafferty is a predator but his behaviour comes across as selfless commitment. For his part, Clayton is too shellshocked to retaliate. If he is humiliated, embarrassed or furious, he lacks the language to say so. Akuwudike is touching in his helplessness. The best he can do is protect his kid brother, Courtney (an impressive Taiden Fairall at this performance). Price is less certain finding drama in the period setting. Clayton’s steelworker father, Patterson (Nicholas Bailey), is contemplating crossing a picket line, but his arguments with the boy’s mother, Freya (Claire Goose), about Thatcherite politics are inert. Apart from the observations about the era’s casual racism and homophobia, they have no bearing on the central story. The director, Jeff James, compensates with a flamboyant production. On Charlotte Espiner’s superb set, half terrace, half front room, he turns training exercises into disco routines and sends footballs cascading over the stage. The theatrical vigour is in sad contrast to the play’s sorry story.

5/13/2022,"The former Conservative leadership contender Jeremy Hunt has suggested he could run for the top job before the 2024 election as he warned Boris Johnson he had “a big mountain to climb” to win another term. Amid the fallout from the Partygate scandal and after bruising losses in last week’s local elections, Hunt told the Times Magazine it was not the “right time” for a leadership change due to the war in Ukraine. “But I would be very open with you that I don’t rule out a return in the future,” he added. Speaking to Times Radio, he also said the “setbacks” the party suffered in the local elections were not just “midterm blues” but reflected the cost-of-living crisis. “To win an election, the Conservative party has to promise a well-funded NHS and the prospect of tax cuts. If we make people choose between one or the other, we’re not going to win the election,” he said. “I do think that we would be wrong to say that the setbacks the Conservative party have are just midterm blues, and there’s a big mountain to climb to win the next election.” Hunt, a former foreign and health secretary, came second to Johnson in the 2019 Conservative leadership contest, having only secured one-third of the vote. He stepped down as foreign secretary and turned down an offer to be defence secretary. Returning to the backbenches, he became chair of the health and social care select committee. He was frequently critical of the government’s approach to the Covid-19 pandemic. This week it was announced the Met had made about 50 further fixed-penalty notice referrals as part of its investigation into possible lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street and across Whitehall. It brought the number of fines to more than 100 – with Johnson, his wife, Carrie, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, hit with fixed-penalty notices in April over a birthday party held for the prime minister in No 10’s cabinet room in June 2020. In last week’s local elections the Conservatives suffered a net loss of 487 seats, while Labour gained 108 and the Liberal Democrats 223. Commentators have warned the results show Johnson’s majority could be in jeopardy at the next general election. Ministers dodged questions on whether they still had faith in the PM when asked about the latest development as they emerged from a cabinet away day in Stoke-on-Trent. The home secretary, Priti Patel, failed to say whether or not she still supported Johnson, while the health secretary, Sajid Javid, also chose not to answer when asked why the PM would not resign, despite Keir Starmer’s promise to do so if he is handed a fixed-penalty notice over similar allegations. The Brexit opportunities minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg; the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries and the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, have all backed the PM. There have been ongoing calls for Johnson to resign over the saga from opposition MPs, as well as his own backbenches, but he has repeatedly said he is determined to get on with the job.",News/Politics,Jeremy Hunt suggests he may run for Tory leadership again,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/13/jeremy-hunt-suggests-he-may-run-for-tory-leadership-again
5/13/2022,"The population of the United States is much younger than that of most European countries, but its political establishment is much older. The 2020 presidential election was fought between 74-year-old Donald Trump and 77-year-old Joe Biden – compare that to 53-year-old Marine Le Pen and 44-year-old Emmanuel Macron in last month’s French presidential election. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, is 71, while minority leader Mitch McConnell is 80. In the generally younger House of Representatives, the majority leader, Nancy Pelosi, is 82, making minority leader Kevin McCarthy look like a spring chicken at a mere 57. This is not just a problem for the functioning of the democratic system; it endangers the survival of it. While the majority of political leaders in the US are over 65, only a small minority of the population – 16.9% – is. This is a serious problem for the representativeness of the political system. Not only are previous generations much less diverse in terms of ethnicity and race, they have very different ideological and partisan profiles. Obviously, there is nothing new to this “rule by the elderly”, but it is increasingly threatening not just satisfaction with the democratic system but the system itself. Although political socialization is a lifelong process, the “impressionable or formative years” are between childhood and adulthood. Similarly, professionally, we are often heavily shaped by the early years of our careers, only partly updating our views later. For the Democratic leaders, this means that they were politically socialized in the 1960s and their professional socialization was in the 1980s – for Biden it even started in the 1970s. All have served in Congress for at least 35 years, starting when Ronald Reagan was president – in Biden’s case it was Richard Nixon – presidents, and Republicans, that most voters know only from the history books. In itself, this huge age gap between elites and masses does not have to create a problem of representation. Politicians like Bernie Sanders (80) and Jeremy Corbyn (72) have become the political heroes of a new generation of voters in recent years. And in terms of political priorities and values even Biden and Pelosi might be relatively close to the people they represent. The real problem is in their dated understanding of politics and the contemporary Republican party, and its political leadership, which has gotten stuck in the 1980s. For instance, President Biden regularly reminisces about the days when he could have lunch with segregationists, when he and politicians he disagreed with could still “respect” each other. (Incidentally, the segregationists were in his own party at that time.) And Pelosi recently said, “I want the Republican party to take back the party to where you were when you cared about a woman’s right to choose, you cared about the environment.” Now, I only moved to this country in 2008, but I am almost 55 and have been following US politics for quite a while, and I cannot remember that Republican party. What Biden and Pelosi still cannot come to grips with, is that the Republican party is a far-right party, increasingly closer to the extreme right than the radical right. A recent poll showed that nearly half of all Republicans agree with the so-called great replacement theory, a racist conspiracy theory mainly propagated by the Fox News host Tucker Carlson, but with a decades-long past in far-right Europe. And while the theory might be new (to the US), the racist sentiments are not. Scholars like Christopher Parker and Matt Barreto showed a decade ago that the Tea Party mobilization was fueled by racial resentment and, as Rachel Blum more recently showed, the Tea Party has since captured the GOP (thereby enabling Trump’s takeover and further radicalization). Like many other older members of the liberal media and political establishment, Biden and Pelosi seem to think that media figures like Carlson and politicians like Ted Cruz do not really mean what they say and simply try to mobilize a crowd with their endorsement of Trump’s stolen election lie, their whitewashing of the storming of the Capitol, or their racist conspiracy theories about a “great replacement”. Leaving aside whether that actually matters, and whether it is morally less reprehensible or politically less dangerous – I actually think it is both more reprehensible and dangerous – it is politically irrelevant. The genie is out of the bottle! Not only are Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy not in control of the Republican party, even Donald Trump is not. When he spoke out in support of Covid-19 vaccines, for example, few if any of “his” base changed their position. And people like Cruz and Josh Hawley have always run after the radicalized base, rather than led it. The point is, even if there were still people left in the Republican party with the courage and conviction to “take back” the party, they lack the power to do so. In fact, it hasn’t been “their” party for decades now. It is high time that both Democrats and Democrats understand this. It is high time that Democratic leaders as well as liberal journalists stop listening to Republican politicians who say in private that they disagree with Trump, the insurrection, or “stop the steal”. They don’t matter! What the Democratic party is facing, as the rest of the country, is a political party that openly undermines the democratic system in word and deed. That is the only Republican party that exists, at least for now. And if they don’t act very quickly, that party will have full control of all major institutions of the country: the presidency, Senate, House and supreme court. To prevent this, we need leaders who live in the here and now, not in some (imagined) past.

5/13/2022,"UK ministers are “picking a number out of the air” when setting civil service staffing targets amid reports the government wants to reduce its headcount by about 90,000, the head of a union has said. The prime minister is understood to have given the cabinet the task of cutting staff by a fifth, saying every bit of cash saved on government spending could be better used elsewhere. Johnson has reportedly ordered ministers to return civil servant numbers to those of 2016 levels in the coming years, with staffing having increased by almost 25% to 475,000 full-time equivalent jobs. Ministers are expected to report back within a month with plans for achieving the cuts from their departments. But Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the plans were “unrealistic”. He said: “That’s what civil servants do. Part of their job is to think of how we do things more efficiently, and they have already committed to 5% cuts in their budgets as part of the spending review. “That kind of ongoing efficiency is what the civil service does all the time. But if you’re going to just simply pluck a figure out of the air and say it’s now 90,000 because there is a convenient point in time where we liked the number, that is not a serious way to look at what does a government want to do and how can it deliver that in the most effective and efficient way.” On Friday morning, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the minister for government efficiency, made several media appearances defending the plans, saying about 38,000 people left the civil service each year and much of the saving could be achieved through a recruitment freeze. But he could not say which departments would be hit by the proposals. Rejecting suggestions of a “return to austerity”, he told Sky News he had seen “duplication” within government departments and the axing will mean people are being used “as efficiently as possible”. “What I’ve seen within the Cabinet Office, which is where I work and bear in mind each secretary of state will be responsible for his or her own department, is that there is duplication within government, so you have a communications department and then you have within another department some people doing communications. “So it’s trying to ensure that you use the resources that you’ve got rather than duplicating it bit by bit.” Asked why the cuts were not being described as a return to austerity, Rees-Mogg said: “I don’t think it is because what is being done is getting back to the efficiency levels we had in 2016.” Mike Clancy, the general secretary of the Prospect union, said the proposal represented “an outrageous act of vandalism on our public services”. “Through Brexit and then the pandemic we have never been more reliant in peacetime on our civil service,” he said. Our members are highly skilled and there is a real risk to government delivery from losing their vital expertise. “They are vital to what the government want to do, whether that is levelling up or pandemic recovery. For them, these cuts to jobs come on the back of significant real terms cuts in pay. The big cuts to public services since 2010 have often proved an expensive error – these proposals risk doubling down on the mistake.” A government spokesperson said “the public rightly expect their government to lead by example and run as efficiently as possible” as the nation faces rising costs.",News/Politics,"UK ministers ‘picking number out of air’ for civil service job cuts, says union",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/13/ministers-picking-number-out-of-air-civil-service-job-cuts-says-union
5/13/2022,"The burkini, or full-body swimsuit, is once again at the centre of a political row in France as Grenoble’s town council prepares to debate loosening rules on swimwear at open-air pools. Rules on swimwear are strict at the majority of French public pools. For example, men must wear tight-fitting racing trunks and cannot wear longer board-shorts, and UV-protective tops or longer clothing are forbidden. Éric Piolle, the high-profile Green mayor of Grenoble, which sits at the foot of the French Alps, has tabled a motion for Monday’s town council meeting to discuss his proposal to allow people to dress “how they like” at outdoor pools. The new rules would allow women as well as men to swim topless and all swimmers to wear full-body swimsuits – whether for sun-protection or personal religious beliefs. The rightwing head of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, Laurent Wauquiez, has threatened to pull all regional funding to the city if the rules are loosened. “Mr Piolle intends to authorise the burkini in municipal pools. I’m warning him: if he does, the region will cut all funding to the city of Grenoble,” Wauquiez tweeted. “Not a centime” of regional money “will finance your submission to Islamism,” he added. M.Piolle projette d’autoriser le burkini dans les piscines municipales.Je mets le maire en garde : dans ce cas, la Région coupera toute subvention à la ville de Grenoble. Pas un centime des Auvergnats-Rhônalpins ne financera votre soumission à l’islamisme. https://t.co/zrSQaC7OC1 An open-letter signed by Jean-Pierre Barbier, the rightwing head of the département council, and his party’s elected officials, said: “The burkini aims, quite simply, to impose Islamist standards at the heart of swimming and public leisure.” Other elected officials signed an open letter opposing full-body swimsuits, which they said represented “the oppression and inferiority of women”. Christophe Ferrari, the leftwing former Socialist party head of the Grenoble-Alpes region, opposed the plans and said Piolle was on an “incomprehensible” one-man “crusade”. The row has been seized upon in the run up to parliamentary elections next month, where the centrist grouping of the newly re-elected president Emmanuel Macron is hoping to win a majority but is facing a challenge from an alliance of leftwing parties, which is led by the radical left’s Jean-Luc Mélenchon and includes Greens and Socialists. On the far-right, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally party is also aiming to increase its seats. Le Pen used the burkini row to attack the broad leftwing parliamentary alliance, saying this week that group included “defenders of burkinis in pools”. It is not the first time full-body swimwear has sparked a political row just before a key election. In the summer of 2016, in the run-up to the 2017 presidential election, about 30 French coastal resorts banned the burkini from beaches, following an initiative by the rightwing mayor of Cannes. The country’s highest administrative court ruled that the anti-burkini decrees were “a serious and manifestly illegal attack on fundamental freedoms”, including the right to move around in public and the freedom of conscience. In Grenoble, Piolle said the new pool rules were not solely about burkinis and that the burkini was a “non-issue”. He said the row showed that the quality of French public political debate was on a downward spiral. “Stop stigmatising and discriminating against Muslims in our country,” he said in an interview on France 2 TV. Piolle said the loosening of pool rules was about lifting “discriminatory” restrictions in the name of health and equality. “Stop transforming women into sexual objects by saying what they should wear,” he said. The row has refocused attention on secularism in France, where the republic is built on a strict separation of church and state, intended to foster equality for all private beliefs. This requires the state to be neutral in terms of religion and allows everyone the freedom to practise their faith as long as there is no threat to public order. Piolle said burkinis in pools had nothing to do with French secularism. State officials in France are required not to wear ostentatious religious symbols at work to protect state neutrality, but Piolle said users of public services, such as swimmers, were simply members of the public who were free to dress as they pleased. In a video posted on Twitter, Piolle said: “We want a public service that is accessible to everyone.” En écoutant de CNews jusqu'au Printemps Républicain, je serais apparemment ""islamo-gauchiste"" et ""wokiste"".Les mots inventés par l'extrême droite empoisonnent le débat public.

5/13/2022,"While you doubtless don’t need to be reminded of the aeons we’ve known dogs and loved them, zoology has had a tendency to neglect them. “For decades in the 20th century,” Howard writes, “dogs were considered unworthy of rigorous study,” since focusing on them for insights into the animal kingdom was “like trying to understand the adaptations of a chicken’s egg by studying the crumbs of a wet cake”. Dogs were somehow rendered inauthentic, almost processed, by their emotional and physical proximity to us. In fact, counters the author, not only do dogs warrant close study – “nothing else on Earth has such a wide range of variations within the same species category” – but every time we’ve done so, we’ve unearthed incomparable wisdom about ourselves. Except when we’ve been wrong: Rudolph Schenkel’s 1947 paper on wolves, hypothesising alpha behaviour and its attendant hierarchies, was applied for years in the fields of both dog and human behaviour, to produce everything from training doctrines (never let your dog enter a house ahead of you) to political theory (what happens when a Donald Trump meets a Kim Jong-un?). But the original study used the wrong kind of wolves (those in captivity behave differently, unsurprisingly), and besides, dogs and wolves are nothing like as similar as they’d have to be to make those kind of extrapolations. While Howard includes these moments of playful humility on behalf of earlier science, his message is profound, though he insists that it’s “straightforward”: “It is simply that the more compassionate we have become in our explorations into the minds of dogs, the more intelligent they have shown us to be. It’s that simple.” When someone tells you how simple something is three times, you might have a hunch that they’re trying to pick your pocket, intellectually speaking, and it actually isn’t that simple. Does he mean we can apply what we learn about dogs’ brains to our own? Or that the leap of trying to empathise with another species is one that builds our compassion? Or that only by extending our imaginations to take in how intelligent a dog could be can we unlock our own intelligence? He means all these things, and more. Pavlov’s famous discovery of classical conditioning in dogs was the first real departure from the previous understanding of the mind as a “black box” that would always remain mysterious. It was actually via a racoon, but never mind, that the watertight certainties of Skinner and his behaviourism were somewhat overturned by new ideas around hard-wiring, in the 1960s. And one of the most fascinating chapters concerns the anti-dog vivisection movement, raging for almost a century from the mid-1800s, which distilled not only a clash between science and morality, but also the mobilisation of middle-aged women against the establishment and its permitted cruelties, bisecting as it went the Suffragette movement and that of the rights of the child. Are we taming or being tamed? Both, the author insists throughout. It would churlish to force a choice, when it’s worked out so well for us all.

Could this hack be the way to accommodate a teeny bag without sacrificing your makeup? The testThis could be my most lol-inducing hack so far. Take a piece of clingfilm double the size of your face and place it over cleansed skin. Make sure it sticks to the top of your face but is left open at the bottom, so you can, essentially, breathe. Then simply apply your regular cream-based makeup products – I opt for concealer, foundation, blush, and lipstick– over the clingfilm. There’s no need to blend, just create dots of product where you’d naturally apply it. Start at the top of your face, then work downwards symmetrically. You should be left with a fake “face” of makeup. Take the clingfilm off, fold it in half and pop it in your bag. When you need to freshen up, reapply the sheet to your face and the cosmetics should transfer in the right places. When I tried it, getting the clingfilm to unfold was tricky – but then I pressed it on to my face, and, sure enough, it worked. A little finger-blending is required, and you’ll need to carry eyeliner, eyeshadow and face powder if you use them. But as a bonus it’s an excellently creepy party trick.

5/13/2022,"A Syrian interpreter who has worked for the British government and the White Helmets has tried to kill himself after waiting nearly two years for a decision on his asylum claim. Ali [not his real name] worked as an interpreter and translator for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in Istanbul, and for Mayday Rescue, a humanitarian organisation that supported the work of the White Helmets (officially known as the Syria Civil Defence) across Syria. Ali arrived on a tier 2 highly skilled worker visa in spring 2020, staying near Liverpool, where he claimed asylum in summer 2020. He was given permission to work and still translates for the White Helmets from the UK. He says that, while he has the right to work, the anxiety and fear of his claim being rejected has had a significant impact on his health and wellbeing. “I can’t sleep. It’s affecting everything – my mental health, my appetite … I can’t eat. I keep getting cramps and feeling really sick. But as I was telling the Home Office guy all this, I said ‘Please, give me a timeframe.’ ‘No, you have to wait.’ I said, ‘What can I do? Please help me. Help me to help myself.’ They said, ‘Write to me about what you’re telling me now.’ It’s even more frustrating to go through even more bureaucracy, when I’ve done everything they asked me to do.” Despite frequently contacting the Home Office for an update on his claim, he says he has been given no timeframe or assurances, leading to a severe deterioration in his mental health. “When I called the Home Office to tell them I am attempting to end my life, they said they will call the police,” he said. “I don’t know if that was a threat or if they were saying it to protect me – but an ambulance arrived two hours later. They treated me kindly, but it’s as if it’s a one-off case, and it’s not. I’m having these black, intrusive thoughts all the time. I feel I’m neglected, left on a desk, with a number, and just forgotten about.” Ali, who was security checked before he began working on UK government-funded projects in 2013, says he feels let down by the government. “Even though I was vetted by the Foreign Office, the Home Office still asked for an accent expert to double check I’m Syrian. Why would one part of the British government trust me to translate highly sensitive material but not trust another branch of the government that I am who I say I am? It makes no sense.” Ali says his family in Syria have become a target as a result of his work with the British government and the White Helmets. In summer 2020, he says his mother was arrested and interrogated in a regime prison. “She is now too terrified to speak to me, worried the line is being monitored,” Ali said. “She’s traumatised and feels she is being watched … and I have no security here, which makes it even worse.” He continues to consult a psychiatrist, who is now offering urgent care, and he is on the strongest dose of antidepressants his doctor can prescribe. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The government is committed to ensuring asylum claims are considered without unnecessary delay, but we are currently prioritising cases involving unaccompanied asylum seeking children. Asylum seekers have access to health and social care services, including mental health support from the point of arrival in the UK. We take every step to prevent self-harm or suicide, including a dedicated team responsible for identifying vulnerable asylum seekers and providing tailored support.” In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

5/13/2022,"The UK’s “golden era” of cheap food is coming to an end, the former Sainsbury’s boss Justin King has warned, saying households should be prepared for higher grocery bills in the long term. King claimed supermarkets could not be expected to absorb the extra costs entirely or protect consumers from rising prices, despite having announced higher earnings. Last month, Tesco and Sainsbury’s reported a doubling in their annual pre-tax profits to £2bn and £730m respectively. “The headline profit numbers are of course, large in the context of any household budget,” King told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “But the margins in supermarkets are around 3%. So even if supermarkets made no profits at all, they wouldn’t really be able to make a huge dent in the cost inflation that is coming through the system,” he said. King warned shoppers would have to start making hard choices on how they spend their money, particularly as soaring inflation – made worse by the ripple effects of the war in Ukraine – pushed up prices on supermarket shelves. The Bank of England said last week headline inflation was likely to exceed 10% this year, the highest since 1982. “We have been perhaps through a golden era. We spend much less as a proportion on average of our household budgets on food than we had almost any time in history, and that’s been [on] a long, gentle decline. So I suspect what we will see is a higher proportion, across the piece, spent on food for the longer term. “It won’t actually be that high in historical terms but it will require adjustments in terms of how we all prioritise our family budget spending,” King added. However, the former Sainsbury’s chief executive recognised many families would not have extra cash to cover higher grocery bills, and said the government should step in with targeted funding through benefits to support struggling households. “For most of us, we can make choices about how much of our household budget is on food … but for some, of course, those choices don’t exist. That’s why the benefit system has to exist,” he said. King suggested any government intervention should be targeted, given the “extraordinary, large sums of money necessary to make a real difference”. He said the decision to introduce a £20 a week uplift on universal credit during the Covid crisis could be a model for extra assistance. “I’d be very supportive of that kind of approach,” King said. His comments echo those made by the NatWest chairman on Thursday. Howard Davies said changes to the benefits system would be the most effective way for the government to help the poorest families battling to cope with the cost of living crisis, instead of cutting taxes, which also gave the wealthy a financial boost.",News/Business,"‘Golden era’ of cheap food is ending, says ex-Sainsbury’s boss",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/13/golden-era-cheap-food-sainsburys-boss-justin-king-benefits-households
5/13/2022,"Torrential rain has been hitting eastern Australia since Monday, with rainfall totals on the north-east coast widely achieving in excess of 100mm. In Yabulu, north of Townsville, there was major flooding on Tuesday as 196mm of rain fell within 24 hours. This was not the highest total recorded, however, with 244mm of rain falling on Tuesday at Mourilyan, near Innisfail on the Cassowary Coast. The threat of heavy rain sank south across Queensland to the south-east, reaching Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast on Wednesday; stations in the south-east recorded up to 100mm, with a station in Dayboro recording 161mm. A further 100-150mm of rain fell on Friday across the south-east. Communities in the Black Mountain region, Noosa, south-east Queensland, have become cut off as a consequence of flash flooding blocking roads, with alternative routes destroyed by a landslide during late February’s heavy rains. Road and school closures have littered Queensland and one woman died on Wednesday after having been swept away in a car in flash floods north of Mackay. River catchments have been inundated and the soils saturated after multiple heavy rain events over the past few months, with swollen rivers and dams full to bursting. Monthly rainfall totals from all this look as if they will be more than three times higher than the monthly average widely across Queensland and northern New South Wales. The recent La Niña event strengthening the easterly winds across the equator has been driving these torrential rains, as increased moisture is fed in from the Pacific for these events. Meanwhile, on Sunday, the tropical cyclones Asani and Karim were seen mirroring each other either side of the equator on satellite imagery. The cyclones developed in the Indian Ocean, with Asani sitting north of the equator to the east of India rotating anticlockwise, while Karim spun clockwise to the south. These differences in rotation are governed by the Coriolis force – this driving northern hemisphere winds to deflect to the right, and southern hemisphere winds deflecting to the left due to the Earth’s rotation. Asani gave some relief to eastern parts of India, which is in the grips of a heatwave, as cloud and rain reached eastern coasts on Wednesday. However, temperatures still reached a sweltering 46C (114.8F) in Gujarat, north-west India, on the same day.",News/Environment,Weather tracker: deadly floods follow week of torrential rain in Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/13/weather-tracker-deadly-floods-week-torrential-rain-australia
5/13/2022,"The Democratic Unionist party has vowed to paralyse the Stormont assembly and block the formation of an executive in a dramatic escalation of its campaign against the Northern Ireland protocol. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, said his party would refuse to nominate a speaker when the assembly meets for its inaugural session on Friday afternoon, a move that will derail the legislature and raise the stakes in a dispute over the protocol between London and Brussels. The party had been expected to block the appointment of a first and deputy first minister in the power-sharing executive but in a statement early on Friday it announced it would also pull the plug on the assembly to further pressure the UK government to take “decisive action” on the protocol. Sinn Féin, which emerged as the largest party in Stormont after last week’s local elections, called the announcement “shameful”. The move will paralyse Stormont and plunge Northern Ireland into political crisis a week after a historic assembly election in which Sinn Féin overtook the DUP as the biggest party, making Sinn Féin’s deputy leader, Michelle O’Neill, the putative first minister. The DUP move is designed to send a signal to Downing Street and the European Union that the party is willing to ratchet up tension in Northern Ireland to secure changes to the protocol, which puts post-Brexit checks on goods entering the region from Great Britain. “Today the DUP will not support the election of a speaker in the assembly,” Donaldson said in a statement to the Belfast News Letter. “The protocol is a direct challenge to the principles that have underpinned every agreement reached in Northern Ireland over the last 25 years. It erodes the very foundations that devolution has been built upon.” Donaldson hinted at no swift resolution to the impasse: “I have both patience and resolve in equal measure to see the Irish Sea border removed, and stable as well as sustainable devolution restored.” The mothballing of Stormont means civil servants and ministers from the outgoing administration, with reduced powers, will run Northern Ireland in what has been termed a “zombified” state. They cannot make important decisions or launch new initiatives. DUP strategists hope this will embolden Boris Johnson, the prime minister, and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, and strengthen their hand in a showdown with the European Commission. They have threatened to unilaterally abandon parts of the protocol but Donaldson said he wanted action, not words. Other parties condemned the DUP. “Today is the day we should be forming an executive to put money in people’s pockets and to start to fix our health service,” said O’Neill. “The DUP have confirmed they will punish the public and not turn up. They are disgracefully holding the public to ransom for their Brexit mess. Shameful.” On Thursday, the Royal College of Nursing, the British Medical Association Northern Ireland, the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, and the Royal College of GPs warned that failure to form an executive would endanger patients’ lives. “Our health service is on the verge of collapse,” they said a joint statement. Naomi Long, the Alliance party leader, called the DUP move a disgrace. She said: “We need the NHS fixed, the cost of living addressed and a budget set. How is this going to help?”",News/UK news,DUP vows to paralyse Stormont as Northern Ireland protocol row deepens,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/13/dup-vows-to-paralyse-stormont-as-northern-ireland-protocol-row-deepens
