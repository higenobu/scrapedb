3/3/2022,"Following a segment on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Wednesday, Carlson, who is Fox News's most popular opinion host, came under fire for questioning the credentials of President Biden‚Äôs Supreme Court Nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson. This came just days after he attacked her very nomination, saying it would humiliate the Supreme Court, and make the U.S. look like Rwanda. Taking a different approach than he did for any of former President Trump‚Äôs three nominees, all of whom are white, Carlson demanded to know what Brown got on her Law School Admission Test, otherwise known as LSAT. ‚ÄúSo is Ketanji Brown Jackson, that even Joe Biden has trouble pronouncing, one of our top legal minds in the entire country? Certainly hope so. Biden‚Äôs right, appointing her is one of his gravest constitutional duties,‚Äù Carlson said. ‚ÄúSo it might be time for Joe Biden to let us know what Ketanji Brown Jackson‚Äôs LSAT score was. How‚Äôd she do on the LSATs? Why wouldn‚Äôt he tell us that? That would settle the question conclusively as to whether she‚Äôs a once-in-a-generation legal talent. It would seem like American‚Äôs in a democracy have a right to know that and much more before giving her a lifetime appointment, but we didn‚Äôt hear that.‚Äù Carlson‚Äôs demand was not well received on Twitter. Number 1: Straight up racist.
Number 2: Right, we always hear about LSAT scores for Republican judges.
Number 3: LSAT scores are about getting into law school, not the quality of a legal mind.
Number 4: Trump's grades and taxes...
Number 5-100: Straight up racist. https://t.co/lvVYHzgQt3 ‚Äî Dan Rather (@DanRather) March 3, 2022 Tucker Carlson wants Ketanji Brown‚Äôs LSAT scores.

3/3/2022,"Russian businessman Alex Konanykhin has put a $1 million bounty on Russian President Vladimir Putin's head. He has called on Russian military officers to go after Putin and arrest him as a war criminal. Konanykhin said he was putting up the bounty to ""facilitate the denazification of Russia."" A Russian investor has put a $1 million bounty on Russian President Vladimir Putin's head, asking for Russian military officers to arrest Putin as a war criminal. ""I promise to pay $1,000,000 to the officer(s) who, complying with their constitutional duty, arrest(s) Putin as a war criminal under Russian and international laws,"" said crypto investor and California-based businessman Alex Konanykhin in a Facebook post on Wednesday. Konanykhin claimed that Putin had violated the Russian constitution by ""eliminating free elections"" and ""murdering his opponents."" ""As an ethnic Russian and a Russia citizen, I see it as my moral duty to facilitate the denazification of Russia. I will continue my assistance to Ukraine in its heroic efforts to withstand the onslaught of Putin's Orda,"" Konanykhin said, using the Russian word for ""horde."" Konanykhin told Insider that he had put up the bounty ‚Äî which will come from his funds ‚Äî to show that the military assault on Ukraine is not being conducted in his name. ""If enough other people make similar statements, it may increase the chances of Putin getting arrested and brought to justice,"" he added. Konanykhin said has not visited Russia since 1992. When asked about whether he feared reprisal from Putin, the businessman said: ""Putin is known to murder his opponents. He has millions of them now."" According to Vice, Konanykhin was at one point worth $300 million. He is now a member of the ""Circle of Money"" on the television series ""Unicorn Hunters"", along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and former 'NSync singer Lance Bass. Konanykhin was granted political asylum in the US in 1999 but ran the risk of being deported when his status was revoked four years later. His asylum status was reinstated in 2007. Putin's invasion of Ukraine has prompted a backlash from Russian oligarchs and lawmakers. In a rare moment of dissent, three Russian lawmakers also spoke out this week about Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Insider's live blog of the Russian invasion is covering developments as they happen.

3/3/2022,"Simon & Garfunkel once described a scenario in which ""friends just can't be found,"" and one can easily imagine that, following Wednesday's United Nations vote condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin and company might find solace in listening to ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" on repeat. According to The New York Times, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning Russian aggression, with 141 countries voting in favor, 34 abstaining, and only five voting against. The result matched the international outpouring of support for Ukraine seen around the world in the past week. Pro-Ukraine demonstrations sprang up in London, Madrid, Milan, Paris, Tokyo, Seoul, Cape Town, and several other cities. During President Biden's State of the Union address on Tuesday, many lawmakers waved small Ukrainian flags or wore Ukrainian flag pins. The no votes on the resolution came from five authoritarian nations: Russia, North Korea, Eritrea, Syria, and Russia's close ally Belarus. The Cato Institute's 2020 Human Freedom Index ranks Russia as the 115th freest country on earth. Belarus barely cracks the top 100 at 99th. Syria appears on the list as the 10th least free country in the world. North Korea and Eritrea, both one-party dictatorships, are not ranked at all. Among the nations that abstained from the vote were Iraq, Iran, India, Pakistan, and China. In early February, China and Russia released a joint statement that, among other things, condemned NATO expansion but did not directly mention Ukraine. The 5 countries who voted against condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine included Russia, Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, and Syria.

3/3/2022,"After a negative experience at work, a woman discovered that a certain word is only ever used to describe female employees. Katrina Palanca uses her TikTok account to share stories that empower AAPI women in their career journeys. The influencer recounted a time at work when a male co-worker labeled her ‚Äúabrasive.‚Äù After feeling upset about the comment, Palanca did some research of her own on the term. What she learned was enlightening. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a word that‚Äôs almost always used to describe women and hardly ever used to describe men,‚Äù Palanca said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to tell you about the time I was called that word.‚Äù When Palanca was preparing for a new hire at work, she ran into an issue with her co-worker ‚ÄúSteve‚Äù from the IT department. She had requested the IT department set up the new hire‚Äôs computer before their first day. After a few days, Palanca went to follow up on the request. She spoke in a ‚Äúmatter-of-fact‚Äù tone that was the ‚Äúequivalent of not putting exclamation points in an email.‚Äù But Steve didn‚Äôt take it too well. ‚ÄúA couple of hours later, my boss comes to my cubicle, he grabs a chair, sits down next to me,‚Äù Palanca recalled. ‚ÄúAnd [he] says, ‚ÄòHey, you‚Äôre not in trouble. I just want you to know that Steve from IT came into my office and said that you were being abrasive.‚Äô‚Äú Although Palanca didn‚Äôt get in trouble at work, the word ‚Äúabrasive‚Äù left her feeling unsettled. She discovered a study by linguist Kieran Snyder, who reviewed 248 performance reviews from 28 small and large companies. Snyder found the word ‚Äúabrasive‚Äù was used 17 times to describe 13 women, but men were never called the word once. In fact, the study found that such character critiques appeared in 71 of 94 women‚Äôs reviews but were totally absent from men‚Äôs reviews altogether. So as it turns out, Palanca‚Äôs experience was just one example of the much broader double standards women face at work.

3/3/2022,"A Chinese news anchor has quickly drawn attention for the colors of her recent on-air attire, which closely resembled those of the Ukrainian flag.

According to Taiwan News, the anchorwoman for Chinese state-run CCTV4 was reporting that NATO was to blame for Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the time she wore the outfit.

Reddit user u/Semetali uploaded a screenshot of the news anchor wearing a bright yellow button-up blouse with a bright blue blazer, colors similar to those in the Ukrainian flag.

 Many users responded to the post, speculating whether the anchor‚Äôs outfit had been worn deliberately to support Ukraine or if the color coordination was just a coincidence. While some contended that the anchor was taking ‚Äúa stand‚Äù or pointed out that the outfit stood out from the usual ‚Äúneutral colors‚Äù worn by Chinese anchors, others believed that it was nothing more than a fashion choice.

‚ÄúInteresting thing about blue and yellow is that they are complimentary [sic] colors, which means they are colors that make each other pop and look better, which is why you commonly see them paired in outfits, paintings, graphic design and pretty much everywhere,‚Äù one user argued. ‚ÄúMaybe she supports Ukraine. Maybe she‚Äôs just good at color coordinating outfits.‚Äù

Users also argued that the blazer‚Äôs color hues differed between the screenshot and the video where the screenshot appears to show a brighter blue while the video shows a more teal-toned blue.

CCTV4 features a mix of English and Chinese language programming and is a part of state-owned China Central Television, or CCTV.

China has not condemned Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and has instead accused the U.S. of causing the conflict. Last week, Horizon News, which operates under Chinese state-owned outlet Beijing News, accidentally leaked editorial instructions on avoiding anti-Russia coverage of the invasion, NextShark previously reported.

3/3/2022,"Israel's Holocaust museum asked the US not to sanction a Russian oligarch ahead of the invasion of Ukraine. In a joint letter to the US envoy in Israel, the Yad Vashem's chairman vouched for Roman Abramovich, saying he is one of its top donors. The letter also said that sanctions on Abramovich would be unfair to the Jewish world. Last month, Israel's Holocaust Memorial Museum, a chief rabbi, and several Israeli charities and organizations asked the US to avoid sanctioning Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, The Times of Israel reported on Sunday. Dani Dayan, chairman of the Yad Vashem museum, had signed a joint letter addressed to Tom Nides, the US ambassador to Israel, saying that Abramovich is the ""second-largest private donor"" to the museum, per the outlet. The letter was dated February 6, per The Times, less than three weeks before Russian President Vladimir Putin declared an assault on Ukraine, but after news emerged that the US was drafting a list of targets to sanction in answer to potential aggression from Moscow. As of Thursday morning, Abramovich, an Israeli-Russian billionaire with close political ties to Putin, has not been placed on the list of oligarchs targeted by Western sanctions. However, the oligarch has reportedly been trying to sell off the English Premier League Team Chelsea FC and property in London ahead of a possible new tranche of financial penalties aimed at him. The letter praised Abramovich for what The Times described as ""investments, philanthropy, and significant contributions to Israel."" It also said that sanctioning Abramovich would be unfair and negatively impact Israel and the Jewish world, The Times reported. ""Mr. Abramovich has contributed to worthy causes for more than a decade,"" Dayan said in the letter, according to The Washington Post. ""As far as I know, Mr. Abramovich doesn't have any links to Mr. Putin."" It is not immediately clear how Dayn assessed Abramovich's relationship with the Russian leader. Abramovich had been one of Putin's earliest supporters as the latter rose to power in the late 1990s. He recommended Putin to then-President Boris Yeltsin and even reportedly bought him a $50 million yacht, The Guardian reported in 2018. Abramovich, who's worth $13.5 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has donated more than $500 million to Israeli and Jewish causes, The Times wrote. Two weeks after the letter was sent, he made an unspecified ""eight-figure donation"" to the Yad Vashem museum, The Times previously reported. On February 22, Yad Vashem announced that it was entering a ""strategic partnership"" with Abramovich that would ""expand and bolster Yad Vashem's research activities, at a time when Holocaust distortion, denial and politicization are rising alarmingly worldwide."" Yad Vashem did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. In response to the invasion of Ukraine, the US and other Western countries have hammered Russia's economy by imposing heavy sanctions that have also targeted oligarchs in Putin's inner circle.

""Ukraine doesn't want to fight, they just don't want Putin's government and don't want to be occupied."" Kutcher also shared tweets from Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky saying that the lodging service is offering free housing to 100,000 refugees fleeing from Ukraine amid Russia's invasion. (Kutcher is an investor in the company.) Over 520,000 refugees have fled Ukraine since Russia waged war last week, the United Nations has estimated. The U.N. expects the total to reach 4 million in coming weeks. Ukrainian civilians have been killed during the invasion, which has seen Russia try to take over Ukrainian cities while the country's army ‚Äî and armed citizens ‚Äî fight back. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed European Parliament on Tuesday, saying, ""We are fighting just for our land and for our freedom,"" adding, ""Nobody's going to break us. We are strong. We're Ukrainians. We have a desire to see our children alive. I think it's a fair one. Yesterday, 16 children were killed."" When Russia invaded last week, Kutcher took to Twitter to say, ""I stand with Ukraine."" The assumption is that he's speaking on behalf of his family as Kunis, 38, does not have public-facing social media accounts. Kunis, who married Kutcher in 2015, was born in Chernivtsi,¬†Ukraine, when it was still part of the former Soviet Union. At age 7, her family moved to the United States ‚Äî with just $250. Kunis has said her parents, who reside near her in Los Angeles, didn't tell her they were moving to a different country when they left, amid the fall of communism. The family, along with her older brother Michael boarded a train to Moscow. From there, they flew to Los Angeles on a refugee visa. She started school days later. ""I literally had no clue of a different continent let alone a different language or people or diversity,"" she said on a HouzzTV special in which she gave her parents condo ‚Äî which they have lived in since 1992 ‚Äî a makeover.

3/3/2022,"Kim Jung-ju, the founder of Nexon, South Korea‚Äôs largest gaming company, died on Feb. 28 in Hawaii at 54 years old.

NXC, Nexon‚Äôs holding company, announced Kim‚Äôs death and stated that he had been undergoing treatment for depression, according to The Korea Herald.

He is survived by his two teenage daughters, Kim Jung-min and Kim Jung-youn, and wife, Yoo Jung-hyun.

Nexon CEO Owen Mahoney released a statement that read:, ‚ÄúIt is difficult to express the tragedy of losing our friend and mentor Jay Kim, a man who had an immeasurably positive impact on the world. As a founder and visionary leader, Jay encouraged those around him to ignore the skeptics and trust their creative instincts. He will be deeply missed by his Nexon family and many friends.‚Äù

Kim launched Nexon in 1994, and it became the first Korean gaming company to earn over $830 million in annual sales within the first year of its debut. Nexon also developed one of the first multiplayer online role-playing games, ‚ÄúThe Kingdom of the Winds,‚Äù in 1996 and launched one of the world‚Äôs most famous games, ‚ÄúMapleStory,‚Äù in 2003.

According to Seoulz, Nexon is now the biggest gaming company in South Korea with a market capitalization of $27 billion.

In 2007, the 54-year-old made his debut on Forbes‚Äô Korea‚Äôs Richest List where he ranked No. 28 with a net worth of $590 million. In June 2021, Kim officially became the third richest man in South Korea with a total net worth of $10.9 billion, reported Forbes.

After pleading not guilty to bribery charges in 2016 when Kim was indicted of lending money to a close prosecutor friend, he focused on various philanthropic work. According to Forbes, in 2017, Kim founded the venture philanthropy fund C Program, and in 2018, he vowed to donate $93 million to children‚Äôs hospitals and startup companies. He also stated that his children would not be inheriting his fortune.

Between 2013 and 2015, his company donated approximately $16.6 million to help build the Purme Foundation Nexon Children's Rehabilitation Hospital in Seoul. Nexon claimed the hospital was the first rehabilitation hospital to be built for children in South Korea.

Prior to his death, Kim continued donating to children‚Äôs hospitals in South Korea and had donated a total of $3.1 million to the Daejeon Chung-nam Public Children‚Äôs Rehabilitation Hospital as well as $2 million to the Nexon Children‚Äôs Palliative Care Center at Seoul National University Hospital, which is planned to open sometime this year.

It's one of several Russian-owned pleasure craft believed to be headed to the sunny island nation, which doesn't have an extradition treaty with the US. The yacht, Clio, is owned by Oleg Deripaska, the founder of the Russian aluminum group Rusal who was sanctioned by the US in 2018. Clio dropped anchor off Mal√©, the capital of the Maldives, on Monday, AFP said, citing port officials. At least two other superyachts owned by Russian billionaires set sail for the Maldives shortly after Western nations threatened to seize assets from sanctioned oligarchs, according to data from MarineTraffic reported by CNBC.

3/3/2022,"Warning: This story contains graphic descriptions of violence. A 24-year-old woman has been charged with the murder of a man whose body parts were found strewn about a Green Bay property and vehicle last week. A person living at the home summoned police on Feb. 23 after discovering a severed head in a bucket, according to a criminal complaint obtained by local outlet WBAY. Officers arriving at the scene made their way down the basement stairs, finding the head still lying in a black bucket on the floor, covered by a towel, and ‚Äúwhat appeared to be dried blood on a nearby mattress.‚Äù A further search of the property turned up a storage tote, in which the upper part of a torso had been stored. Taylor Schabusiness, allegedly the last person to have seen the 25-year-old victim alive, was found at a nearby house. Her clothing was spackled in dried blood, according to the complaint, and police searching her van found a crock pot box containing other human body parts, ‚Äúincluding legs.‚Äù When police asked her what had happened, Schabusiness replied, ‚ÄúThat is a good question.‚Äù She was later charged with first-degree intentional homicide, mutilating a corpse, and third-degree sexual assault. Schabusiness allegedly killed and dismembered her victim after first smoking methamphetamine with him, according to the complaint. They initiated a sexual encounter that then escalated to include the use of chains, which Schabusiness characterized as a dog‚Äôs choke collar. There were two, she said‚Äîone for her, and one for him. Eventually, Schabusiness says she began strangling him with her bare hands. She told investigators that she could feel his heart continuing to beat as she choked him, ‚Äúso she kept pulling and choking him harder.‚Äù She kept going as the man‚Äôs face turned purple and blood came out of his mouth, local outlet WISN reported, citing the complaint. She then played with the cadaver for ‚Äútwo to three hours‚Äù after his death, using several knives to dismember the body, prosecutors alleged in the complaint. A bread knife ‚Äúworked the best,‚Äù she explained in a police interview, ‚Äúbecause of the serrated blade.‚Äù Schabusiness told the police that they‚Äôd ‚Äúhave fun trying to find all of the organs,‚Äù according to the complaint. Her plan had been to bring all of the body parts with her, but, being ‚Äúparanoid and lazy‚Äù as she put it, she left the head behind. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I left the head, though,‚Äù she said Schabusiness told investigators that she had just gone ‚Äúcrazy,‚Äù and blacked out during at least part of the encounter. She asked them ‚Äúif they knew what it was like to love something so much that you kill it,‚Äù according to the Green Bay Press Gazette. The name of the victim was not immediately released by the authorities. On Tuesday, a Brown County court set bail for Schabusiness at $2 million, deeming her a flight risk. She had been placed on probation just weeks before the alleged murder, and was missing the monitoring bracelet she was supposed to have been wearing. ‚ÄúI think the facts alleged are extremely concerning and disturbing and go to the violent and grave nature of the offense,‚Äù Assistant District Attorney Caleb Saunders said at the hearing. He called it ‚Äúone of the most serious offenses‚Äù committed in the county in a long time. Appearing via video link, Schabusiness said little at the hearing, WBAY reported. She seemed calm.

3/3/2022,"By Maki Shiraki and Jamie Freed TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Airlines Co Ltd and ANA Holdings Inc said they would cancel all flights to and from Europe on Thursday, citing safety concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The airlines, which normally use Russian airspace for their Europe flights, join a growing number of carriers that have cancelled or rerouted flights between Europe and north Asia in the wake of the crisis. ""We are continuously monitoring the situation, but given the present situation in Ukraine and the different risks, we have decided to cancel flights,"" a JAL spokesperson told Reuters. ANA Cargo's website said the suspension of flights was due to the ""high possibility of its operations not being able to overfly Russia due to the current Ukraine situation."" Airlines from the European Union and Canada have been banned from Russian airspace in response to their curbs on Russian airlines, but Japan has not made a similar announcement to date. ANA and JAL operate about 60 flights per week through Russian airspace between Tokyo and London, Paris, Frankfurt, and Helsinki, according to a spokesperson for flight tracking website FlightRadar24. Finnair, which had initially cancelled its Tokyo flights after losing access to Russian airspace, said on Wednesday it would resume four weekly Helsinki-Tokyo flights with a new route and a flight time of 13 hours, up from around 9.5 hours previously. Longer routes by airlines will add to fuel costs and reduce the amount of cargo that can be carried in a tight market for air freight that is exacerbating pandemic-related disruptions in global supply chains. Korean Air Lines was still flying over Russian airspace on Thursday, according to Reuters monitoring of FlightRadar24, but Taiwanese carriers are now avoiding Russian airspace and are flying over China and central Asia. Both JAL and ANA cancelled eight flights each carrier had scheduled for Friday. The impacted routes included those to London, Paris, Frankfurt, and Helsinki. A Tokyo-Brussels flight due to carry vaccines on the return leg will be routed over central Asia, ANA said, adding all cargo flights will operate. JAL said the cancellation of its flights impacts 237 people who were booked onto flights bound to and from Helsinki, Frankfurt, Paris, and London. A separate London-bound JAL flight will not be cancelled but re-routed to avoid Russian airspace.

3/3/2022,"(Reuters) - Serbia is coming under ""huge pressure"" as it resists joining the European Union, the United States and other countries in imposing sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Wednesday. Serbia is performing a delicate balancing act between its European aspirations, partnership with NATO and its centuries-old religious, ethnic and political alliance with Russia. Vucic said that Serbia had joined a United Nations General Assembly condemnation of Russia's attack on Ukraine, but that no sanctions were implied. Serbia was the only country in Europe which had declined to introduce sanctions against Russia, he added. ""Serbia is in an exceptionally difficult situation, there is less understanding than ever for the position of our nation,"" Vucic said in a televised address. ""We are facing huge pressure."" The country, which relies on Russia for its energy needs, is under pressure to harmonise its foreign policy with that of the EU, which it aims to join. While the EU and Russia have issued tit-for-tat airspace bans, Serbia's flag carrier Air Serbia is still flying between Belgrade and Moscow and has added extra capacity. Vucic said he feared that Serbia might lose its support in the United Nations regarding the status of its former province of Kosovo if Russia is ordered out of the world body. Serbia lost control of Kosovo after a NATO bombing campaign in 1999 to halt killing of ethnic Albanians by Serb forces during a two-year counterinsurgency but still claims the breakaway province as part of its territory. Russia also does not recognise Kosovo's independence.

3/3/2022,"As the eighth day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine began Thursday morning, Russian forces appeared to have gained tactical control of their first city, the southern port city of Kherson, but Ukraine is still holding out in Mariupol, Kharkiv, and Chernihiv, despite heavy shelling. Deaths are mounting on both sides. Big explosions were heard in Kyiv overnight, but according to the British Defense Ministry's Thursday morning update, the main body of the 40-mile-long Russian military convoy advancing on the capital remains nearly 20 miles from the city center, ""having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown, and congestion. The column has made little discernible progress in over three days."" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby gave a similar prognosis on Wednesday, saying the ""stalled"" column hasn't, ""from our best estimates, made any appreciable progress in the last 24-36 hours,"" possibly because the Russians are ""regrouping themselves and reassessing the progress that they have not made and how to make up the lost time,"" but probably also due to ""logistics and sustainment challenges"" and ""resistance from the Ukrainians."" Trent Telenko, a retired Pentagon staff specialist and military history blogger, suggests another big reason may be Russia's tires, as he explained in a long, illustrated Twitter thread based on photos of deserted Russian Pantsir-S1 wheeled gun-missile systems and his own experience as a U.S. Army vehicle auditor. ""When you leave military truck tires in one place for months on end,"" the sidewalls get brittle in the sun and fail like the tires on the Pantsir-SR, he wrote. ""No one exercised that vehicle for one year."" Karl Muth, an economist, government adviser, and self-described ""tire expert,"" jumped in, agreeing with Telenko but adding some details about the tires. ""There is a huge operational level implication in this,"" Telenko said. ""If the Russian Army was too corrupt to exercise a Pantsir-S1, they were too corrupt to exercise the trucks and wheeled [armored fighting vehicles] now in Ukraine,"" meaning ""the Russians simply cannot risk them off-road during the Rasputitsa/mud season."" That is a problem for the convoy in the north, he added. ""The Crimea is a desert and the South Ukrainian coastal areas are dryer. So we are not seeing this there. But elsewhere the Russians have a huge problem for the next 4 to 6 weeks."" Read Telenko's whole thread on Twitter.

3/3/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two-term U.S. Representative Van Taylor on Wednesday withdrew from a Republican primary run-off race, ending his reelection bid after admitting he had an extra-marital affair with the widow of an American who joined the Islamic State, according to media reports. Taylor, who represents a northeast Texas district, last year voted for the creation of a special congressional panel to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol, earning the ire of former President Donald Trump, whose supporters mounted the deadly attack. Taylor's withdrawal came one day after he led a pack of five Republicans in a primary race with 48.7% of the vote, just shy of the 50% needed to win his party's nomination. With his withdrawal, a former Texas county judge, Keith Self, became the Republican nominee who will run in the Nov. 8 general election for the seat representing an area north of Dallas, including Plano. The Dallas Morning News quoted Taylor telling supporters he had made ""a horrible mistake"" by engaging in the affair with the woman.

3/3/2022,"If an alien civilization far more advanced than anything on Earth existed thousands of years ago, would they have embedded a piece of metal inside someone‚Äôs skull? That is, at least, what this looks like. An (undoubtedly human) skull from Peru, which was donated to the Museum of Osteology in Oklahoma from a private collection, is now the object of controversy because of a mysterious metal implant. The elongated skull almost looks alien, but head-binding was a common practice in Peru and other parts of the ancient world. It has not yet been carbon dated or examined up close by any archaeologists. Whether the implant is authentic raises questions. But why is there even a gaping hole in the first place? It could the been blunt-force trauma. It could have also been trepanation. Long before ibuprofen existed, it was thought cutting an opening into the skull would relieve pressure from fluid that caused headaches. Archaeologist John Verano of Tulane University, an expert in trepanned skulls and also author of the book Holes in the Head, is not convinced the piece of metal had any medical use back then. ‚ÄúForgeries have been pretty easy to recognize because they made no sense in terms of surgical treatments,‚Äù he told SYFY WIRE. ""I'm highly dubious; it is probably a cranium ‚Äòaccessorized‚Äô to increase its value to a collector.‚Äù Photo: The Museum of Osteology Verano had previously seen skulls that could have been forgeries in a Peruvian museum. That particular museum also has a reputation for fakes. In one of these skulls that he observed, the trepanation was real based on the linear way the opening was cut, but it was then filled with gold. Remember that scene from Game of Thrones where Khal Drogo poured molten gold onto the head of a screaming Viserys? It looked as if the gold had been molten at the time the hole was plugged ‚Äî and had this person been alive, it would have probably felt like Viserys‚Äô demise. Trepanation sounds gruesome, but before there was so much as a semblance of modern medicine, it was the only headache relief that many ancient peoples could think of. If the extra fluid could ooze out, then the pressure would be relieved, but what was problematic about this was that you would still be left with a literal hole in your head. The procedure ended up being fatal for some. Others who underwent it survived, as evidenced by signs of healing in ancient trepanned skulls, but they were especially vulnerable to infection without antibiotics. ‚ÄúThe skull does show multiple fracture lines that mark a serious blow to the head, although he survived the injury, as marked by healing of the margins of the fracture,‚Äù Verano said. ""Unfortunately, if there is a trepanation under the metal it is not visible, so it's unclear if there is in fact evidence of surgery.‚Äù Your brain is just about the last place you would want an infection. It is impossible to tell whether survivors of trepanation died from that or something else, but there was a high risk. It is possible that the owner of this skull had not undergone a trepanation at all and instead was the victim of severe head trauma. What they succumbed to is and may remain a mystery. It might have been meant for the afterlife, though that is unlikely. Verano knows of only one trepanned skull whose hole was covered with metal that was apparently a grave offering. In Holes in the Head, Verano describes a Paracas mummy from Peru‚Äôs southern coast. There had been a trepanation performed on the forehead, and the wound was covered with a thin plate of hammered gold, but the plate itself was clearly not made to be an implant. Though many archaeologists thought it was evidence that ancient Peruvians used some sort of implant to keep the skull protected, the problem is that the patient did not survive the trepanation. Meaning, if this had been cranioplasty ‚Äî something it didn‚Äôt appear like ‚Äî then it failed. Photo: The Museum of Osteology  ""X-rays probably won't help, because they won't penetrate the metal and show what's under it,‚Äù said Verano. ""If the metal could be somehow delicately removed it would be helpful, but this might damage the skull. An elemental analysis of the metal could be informative.‚Äù He added that he had never seen metalwork like this from ancient Peru. So is it a previously unknown innovation? Blatant forgery? Aliens? The answer is still buried in the past.     ",Science/SYFY,Is the space-age metal implant in this ancient skull for real?,https://news.yahoo.com/space-age-metal-implant-ancient-010845806.html
3/3/2022,"By Joel Schectman, Christopher Bing and James Pearson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Ukrainian cyber guerrilla warfare group plans to launch digital sabotage attacks against critical Russian infrastructure such as railways and the electricity grid, to strike back at Moscow over its invasion, a hacker team coordinator told Reuters. Officials from Ukraine's defense ministry last week approached Ukrainian businessman and local cybersecurity expert Yegor Aushev to help organize a unit of hackers to defend against Russia, Reuters previously reported. On Monday, Aushev said he planned to organize hacking attacks that would disrupt any infrastructure that helps bring Russian troops and weapons to his country. ""Everything that might stop war,"" he told Reuters. ""The goal is to make it impossible to bring these weapons to our country."" Aushev said his group has already downed or defaced dozens of Russian government and banking websites, sometimes replacing content with violent images from the war. He declined to provide specific examples, saying it would make tracking his group easier for the Russians. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbor's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. A Ukrainian defense attache in Washington declined to comment on Aushev's group or its relationship with the defense ministry. Aushev said his group has so far grown to more than 1,000 Ukrainian and foreign volunteers. The group has already coordinated with a foreign hacktivist organization that carried out an attack on a railway system. After word spread of the formation of Aushev's team, the Belarusian Cyber Partisans, a Belarus-focused hacking team, volunteered to attack Belarusian Railways because they said it was used to transport Russian soldiers. The Cyber Partisans disabled the railway's traffic systems and brought down its ticketing website, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday. On Monday, a Cyber Partisans spokeswoman told Reuters the group carried out those attacks and confirmed her organization was now working with Aushev's group. The spokeswoman said because her group had brought down the reservation system, passengers could only travel by purchasing paper tickets in person. She sent Reuters a photo of a paper, handwritten ticket issued on Monday. ""We fully side with Ukrainians,"" she said. ""They are now fighting for not only their own freedom but ours too. Without an independent Ukraine, Belarus doesn‚Äôt stand a chance."" Reuters could not confirm attacks against the Belarus railway's traffic system. The company's reservation website was down on Tuesday afternoon. A railway spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Officials at the Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told a Russian news outlet on Tuesday that Russian embassies were under cyberattack by ""cyber terrorists from Ukraine."" Beyond striking back at Moscow, Aushev said his team would help Ukraine's military hunt down undercover Russian units invading cities and towns. He said his group had discovered a way to use cellphone tracking technology to identify and locate undercover Russian military units moving through the country, but declined to provide details. Russian troops are reportedly using commercial cell phones in Ukraine to communicate, multiple media outlets reported. Over the last week, numerous Russian government websites have been publicly interrupted by reported distributed denial of service (DDoS) style attacks, including one for the office of President Vladimir Putin.

A small briefcase, known as the Cheget, is kept close to the president at all times, linking him to the command and control network of Russia's strategic nuclear forces. The Cheget does not contain a nuclear launch button but rather transmits launch orders to the central military command - the General Staff. IF PUTIN GIVES THE NUCLEAR ORDER, WHAT HAPPENS? The Russian General Staff file:///C:/Users/8011323/Downloads/FOIR1588.pdf has access to the launch codes and has two methods of launching nuclear warheads. It can send authorisation codes to individual weapons commanders, who would then execute the launch procedures. There is also a back-up system, known as Perimetr, which allows the General Staff to directly initiate the launch of land-based missiles, bypassing all the immediate command posts. DID PUTIN'S 'HIGH ALERT' ORDER MAKE A LAUNCH MORE LIKELY? Putin said at the weekend that the nation's nuclear forces should be put on high alert. The following day, Russia's defence ministry announced that its nuclear missile forces had been placed on ""enhanced"" combat duty. The phrase enhanced, or special, combat duty does not appear in Russia's nuclear doctrine, leaving military experts puzzled over what it might mean. Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva, said on Twitter that the order might have activated Russia's nuclear command and control system, essentially opening communication channels for any eventual launch order. Alternatively, he said it might just mean the Russians added staff to their nuclear facilities. DO THE RUSSIANS HAVE RULES ON NUCLEAR LAUNCHES? The 2020 doctrine presents four scenarios which might justify the use of Russian nuclear weapons: -- the use of nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction against Russia or its allies; -- data showing the launch of ballistic missiles aimed at Russia or its allies; -- an attack on critical government or military sites that would undermine the country's nuclear forces response actions; -- the use of conventional weapons against Russia ""when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy"". WHAT NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES DOES RUSSIA HAVE? The Federation of American Scientists https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces estimates that Russia has 5,977 nuclear warheads, more than any other country. Of these, 1,588 are deployed and ready for use. Its missiles can be fired from the land, by submarines and by airplanes. Putin oversaw a coordinated test of Russia's nuclear forces on Feb. 19 shortly before ordering troops into Ukraine. HAS RUSSIA EVER USED A NUCLEAR WEAPON IN WAR? No. To date, the only use of nuclear weapons during conflict was the atomic bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States in 1945, at the end of World War Two.
