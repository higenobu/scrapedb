2/17/2022,"If you are skiing or walking near Zermatt, a visit to the 2,130-metre-high Chez Vrony in Findeln is not to be missed. It is located next to an easy ski run and is easily accessible on foot in summer months too. It is like walking into someone’s beautiful house, cosy chairs, log fires, a sunny terrace and a view of the Matterhorn to die for. My favourite time is mid-afternoon when the lunch crowds have gone, and you can sit in the sun on the terrace and enjoy homemade apple strudel with vanilla sauce, washed down with the best glühwein you’ll find anywhere in the Alps. The only difficult part is motivating yourself to leave.Jayne Pearson  If you’re looking for a morning coffee stop in the La Plagne ski area with super service, delicious coffee and a sun trap terrace, look no further than Carlina in Belle Plagne. Its central location and ski-on, ski-off access makes it the destination of choice on a relaxed “food-first” ski trip. It also has a superb lunch menu with a reasonably priced plat du jour and classic French mountain meals such as diot (sausage) and tartiflette (made with potatoes, reblochon cheese, lardons and onions). If you’re in the area it’s not one to miss. Coffee is about €7 for two and dishes €16-€25 each.Marcus Standish Refuel and refresh with a traditional schnitzel paired with a cold crisp beer while basking in the picturesque panoramic views of the Austrian Alps. Situated 1,800 metres up, in the heart of the Kitzbühel ski area is the Sonnenrast restaurant. Being just across from the Fleckalmbahn gondola means skiers of all abilities have access to this mountaintop eatery. The Sonnenrast offers traditional Austrian dishes along with hot and cold beverages, which can be enjoyed on the beautiful wooden terrace; this star attraction wraps around the building providing spectacular views of the mountain terrain. Dishes start at about €15.Thea You can almost hear the James Bond theme tune playing as you reach the Top Mountain Star in Obergurgl-Hochgurgl. Perched on a narrow ridge of the Wurmkogel peak, this glass structure with a Swarovski studded bar on a ridge at 3,080 metres really is a cafe with a view – a 360-degree panorama across the Ötztal Alps. Truly breathtaking. There is a black run down but if you don’t fancy that there is a long blue track and failing that you can use the lifts to go on foot. Ice cool!Samantha Little A slightly tricky but doable red piste downhill, or a 40-minute snowshoe up, and you arrive at Grand Crêt 17, the 300-year-old barn that Onno and his family have spent the past four years restoring. It’s beautiful inside and out, with a breathtaking view of the Giffre valley and the landmark Criou mountain above Samoëns in the Grand Massif. Expect a delightful warm tuna niçoise, super garlicky chicken or the massive côte de boeuf, all cooked on the barbecue in summer or winter. Leave space for great puds, too. Mains are €20ish.V Young  Guardian Travel readers' tips Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels. A selection of tips will be featured online and may appear in print. To enter the latest competition visit the readers' tips homepage - We stumbled upon Das Elephant on a ski trip. Our snowboard crazy boys were blitzing the black runs and … well, their parents weren’t! In search of a hot drink and a radiator we were just blown away by the views from this restaurant at 2,475 metres above sea level on a mountain called Crap Masegn. The food is also superb (its signature dish is penne from the parmesan loaf but there’s also cream of rocket and wasabi soup with prawns, and slow cooked beef with polenta among menu favourites) and is mentioned by Michelin. There is also an intriguing backstory to the place: in 1992, as part of the Crap Art (a reference to the mountain’s name, not the art’s quality) cultural event, an elephant was a guest for four days on the mountain Crap Sogn Gion, leading to the restaurant being named after it.Ceri Fitzpatrick The restaurant at Sonnenberg will always feel like home. On one holiday to Mürren, all the ski lifts were closed due to a heavy snowfall. Undeterred, my family and I hiked up the mountain through the woods in a total white-out. After several chilly hours walking, we noticed the smell of wood smoke and spied some glowing lights through the fog. When we got to the door, the Sonnenberg’s proprietor welcomed us with warming bowls of gulaschsuppe in an otherwise empty dining room. Years later, we returned to the Sonnenberg to discover its fantastic views of the Jungfrau, something we had missed out on through all that snow. Charlotte A characterful 120-year-old chalet, hung with family photos, Le Corbeleys is unfailing in its warm welcome and hot, hot chocolate. Serving homemade Savoyard fare – diots €20 and blueberry tart €8.50 – this is great value in the Trois Vallées, where lunch can command silly money. Enjoy spectacular views from the large deck or cosy up inside in a nest of sheepskins and red gingham, hang your gloves to steam by the log burner and sip a vin chaud from the neat little bar. Fitting reward after burning down the rollers of epic blue run Jérusalem (formerly a red run but now reclassified). The chalet is on the plateau between Saint Martin 1 and 2 lifts, above Saint Martin de Belleville.Caroline Elderfield The Dolomites are the most beautiful mountains in Europe, and I’m hugely looking forward to returning there very soon. Even though it’ll be four years since I last skied in the area, I feel sure of a warm welcome at Muliné above Selva Val Gardena. It’s just off the Saslong B red piste above the romantic, ski-in, ski-out Fischburg castle. The interior perfectly exemplifies the concept of gemütlichkeit (good cheer). The food is the marvellous mixture of north Italian and Austro-German that you get in the Alto Adige/Südtirol, with lots of meat and cheese and dumplings. If I’m skiing I’ll avoid the wine list, but if I go back in the evening...Martin Lunnon Growing up in Birmingham, a mixed grill was the ultimate pub lunch. Every meat imaginable, egg and chips. So when I saw mixed grill on a menu at the Bärenwirth in Patsch, just south of Innsbruck, I thought, why not? Cosy timbered restaurant with Alpine views. Bring it on! But, ugh – potatoes, slimy vegetables (yuck) and gravy. Yes there was meat, but just one kind. To be polite and not to betray my ignorance, I had to at least have a crack. And on a month-long trip around Europe, it proved to be hands down the best meal I ate. I even mopped up the gravy with the bread. Added bonus of staying in the hotel above, balcony overlooking a Tirolean church backed by not one, but two stunning V-shaped valleys.Antony T",Lifestyle/Travel,"Stunning vistas, sumptuous food: readers’ favourite Alpine ski cafes and restaurants",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/feb/17/best-alpine-cafes-restaurants-ski-switzerland-france-austria
2/17/2022,"When I started in television nearly 30 years ago, to take broadcast-quality pictures out and about you needed an expensive camera requiring an Olympic weightlifting-style lift and jerk to get it on your shoulder. Now you can film astounding quality stuff on your average smartphone. Video technology has moved on beyond recognition. Sound technology, however, seems to have changed not at all. This week I filmed an edition of Winter Walks, the brilliant BBC programme in which someone is filmed, well, walking in winter. The camera technology is astonishing. I held a featherweight 360-degree camera on a stick, to capture everything from my viewpoint, while a tiny drone filmed stunning stuff from the sky. But every half an hour we’d have to stop for the poor sound man to unzip my coat and faff around changing batteries on my two radio mics, and adjust them to stop any rustling.  The only other way of doing it would be to walk near me with a huge boom mic on a long pole. Either way, the sound is monitored and adjusted remotely on a heavy, pricey mixer slung around someone’s neck. This is how it’s been done for decades. The unusual thing here was that we actually had a specialist sound recordist on the job – they’re a dying breed. Usually, the camera operator somehow has to do it these days. Cuts, you see. This is bonkers, because in the edit you can find ways of working around poor pictures, but there’s next to nothing you can do if the sound’s no good. Kids – and grownups too – often show me wonderful little films they’ve made using their phones, but the poor sound always lets them down. You see the same thing on news video, often caught in high quality on bystanders’ phones, but the sound is a mess. The revolution will be televised, all right; we’ll see what’s going on clearly, crisply and sharply, but hear nothing of it very clearly at all.

2/17/2022,"“Studies predict that with climate change, skiing will be able to take place here in its current form until 2050…” These profound words came not from an environmentalist, but from the lips of Patrick Arnaud, the manager of Serre Chevalier ski area in the French Alps. As I sat there, looking up at the snow-capped peaks behind him, with my 16-month-old son on my lap, all I could think was how close that date suddenly felt. Ask people if taking a ski trip is good for the environment and they’ll likely come back with a resounding no. First there’s the way people often access it – via short-haul, carbon-emitting flights. Then there’s the type of work that has to be done on the mountain to make it suitable for skiers – from deforestation and grooming pistes (using diesel-powered vehicles), to running chairlifts to get people back up the slopes (yet more greenhouse gas emissions). And then there’s the catch-22 in the form of snow production – with temperatures rising, more snow needs to be made artificially to keep the traditional areas open, but this emits more carbon into the atmosphere, exacerbating the problem.  Yet, as I was finding out in Serre Chevalier, it doesn’t have to be this way. It started for me by ditching the plane and heading to the region’s capital, Briançon, via train. The all-electric Eurostar started my family off on a green footing straight from London (Eurostar says you can take 13 journeys on it before you produce the same amount of carbon emitted in just one flight to an equivalent airport, such as Grenoble or Lyon), before catching the SNCF sleeper train from Paris the same day. The next morning, we awoke in our cosy couchette to a panoramic view of the Alps from our beds. Despite any fears (mine and, undoubtedly, other passengers’), the baby slept well in his travel cot on the floor, while I too was rocked to sleep by the motion of the carriage. We arrived on the train at Briançon and to a well-timed bus connection to head immediately into Chantemerle, the hub of the four-centre valley. Serre Chevalier was due to celebrate 80 years as a ski resort in 2021, and when Covid hit in 2020 and tourists couldn’t come, rather than lamenting its loss the resort decided to up its environmental plans. The four centres – Briançon, Chantemerle, Villeneuve la Salle and Le Monetier-les-Bains – had already pledged to do their best to reduce their carbon footprint by 2030, but on reflection they decided to aim at producing 30% of all their electricity supply themselves by 2023. “Everyone said we were crazy, that it was impossible,” said Patrick, “but now we are on track to exceed that figure.” After dropping off my boy at nursery I headed up the mountain. Patrick had explained how ski resorts were the easiest places to convert to renewable energy. They have 300 days of sunshine a year, plenty of wind high up, and streams already piped for snow-producing cannon can be harnessed to produce hydroelectricity (this accounts for 80% of all renewables here) – they are plugged into the existing network but give electricity rather than takes it when not producing snow. And to install everything requires no cutting down of trees, as the infrastructure is there already. As I ascended higher I noticed the glinting solar panels on the roofs of the chairlifts. So effective are they in winter – thanks to the intensity of the sun reflecting off snow – that the chairlifts produce more power than they consume. As I went to the top of the mountain and began my descent on a particularly swooshy blue, I spied one of the wind turbines – another of Chevalier’s renewables – which efficiently powers yet more lifts. For my final run of the day I found myself navigating a slightly bumpy slope, part of the experimental changes at Chevalier. “Grooming accounts for 90% of our energy consumption,” Patrick said, “and 50 years ago we groomed less.” Even though most of their piste bashers have been hybrid (diesel and electrically powered since 2012 – with the plan to be electric and hydro-powered by 2030 – the resort has been asking customers if they need all slopes to be groomed quite so widely. As I bounded down the piste, screaming with glee, I decided that perhaps a little stomach lurch now and again was worth it for the greater good. Our accommodation that evening was at the Gîte Le Rebanchon (from €70 bed and breakfast) in the tiny village of Le Casset, at the northern end of Chevalier. Although located further out from the pistes, its mountain-themed rooms were comfy, and the hotel’s Eco Gite label denotes a pledge to preserve natural resources, use renewable energy and source natural, local and recyclable products. That night we walked up to Trinquet des Boussardes, a brand new Ecotable-certified restaurant, where owner Nicolas Boutard cooks fresh, seasonal and local produce on an open fire, with zero waste. We enjoyed a vegetable tartare made with a mix of greens from Hautes-Alpes farmers, followed by wood-fired, spiced mushrooms and potatoes from the Altitude Bio organic shop in Briançon. Over the next couple of days, besides more skiing – Chevalier has 81 runs spread over Briançon, Chantemerle, Villeneuve and Le Monêtier-les-Bains – there were also a number of environmentally sound activities to try. Where other resorts have introduced snowmobiles for an adrenaline rush, here there is a different sort of horse power. Ski joëring involves harnessing yourself to a horse and being pulled along at speed. Though my instructor, Fanny, was sympathetic to my lack of core strength (vital, apparently) she didn’t waste time getting the horse to gallop around the icy course – while warning that my screaming would only encourage it to go faster. Slightly more sedate was snowshoeing, which I took my son along for one evening, as it began just outside our gite. There, guide Laura took a group of us hiking into the woodland of the surrounding Ecrins national park, telling us about the two glaciers within – which were formerly one, but global warming saw it retreat and split – before bringing us to a clearing where two tipis were set for us to make our own fondue with local cheese. “We normally offer this experience in an igloo,” Laura said, gesturing poignantly at a huge mass of snow, “but it got too warm and it’s melted already.” On the final day, before my last run on the slopes (during which I would try a new, low-impact offering – a 1.1km zipline down), I took my baby to Les Grand Bains in Monêtier, pools fed by natural thermal springs. There he happily splashed in the outdoor baths while I gazed up at the slopes behind him through rising steam. When it comes to being more sustainable, Chevalier is not only attempting to produce its own electricity, but also reducing its consumption. Plans include running ski lifts slower when there are no queues (a minute longer on the lift means a 20% saving on energy used) and using snow cannon sparingly (last season, pre-Covid, they made 25% less snow with no impact on customer satisfaction). This ski region’s attitude – and marketing slogan – is “All we need is change”, and that goes from the resort switching to renewables, reducing energy use and offering sustainable accommodation and locally sourced food, to us, the skiers, doing our bit to make our favoured activity less carbon intensive. Because, as Patrick said when he revealed they were offering their blueprint for renewable conversion to competitor ski resorts, “we’re not doing this for Chevalier, we’re doing this for the planet. If all the resorts make this change, imagine the difference it would make.” I thought about that on our way to the railway station. One family committing to take a more sustainable ski trip may be akin to a single snowflake falling. But, with enough of us making the change, the cumulative results could ensure a winter wonderland survives well past 2050.The trip was provided by Serre Chevalier; rail travel by Eurostar (London-Paris return from £79) and SNCF (Paris-Briançon from €29 for a shared couchette – private option available).

2/17/2022,"The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack is considering issuing a subpoena to Ivanka Trump to force her cooperation with the inquiry into Donald Trump’s efforts to return himself to power on 6 January, according to a source familiar with the matter. Any move to subpoena Ivanka Trump and, for the first time, force a member of Trump’s own family to testify against him, would mark a dramatic escalation in the 6 January inquiry that could amount to a treacherous legal and political moment for the former president.  The panel is not expected to take the crucial step for the time being, the source said, and the prospect of a subpoena to the former president’s daughter emerged in discussions about what options remained available after she appeared to refuse a request for voluntary cooperation. But the fact that members on the select committee have started to discuss a subpoena suggests they believe it may ultimately take such a measure – and the threat of prosecution should she defy it – to ensure her appearance at a deposition on Capitol Hill. The select committee did not address a possible subpoena for Ivanka Trump at a closed-door meeting last Friday, and the panel wants to give her a reasonable window of opportunity to engage with the investigation before moving to force her cooperation, the source said. The panel would also have to formally vote to move ahead with such a measure, the source said, and Thompson would probably inform the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, of the decision before formally authorizing a subpoena to the former president’s daughter. But members on the select committee are not confident that Ivanka Trump would appear on her own volition, the source said, and the discussion about a subpoena reflected how important they consider her insight into whether Trump oversaw a criminal conspiracy on 6 January. The chairman of the select committee, Bennie Thompson, said in an 11-page letter requesting her voluntary cooperation last month that the panel wanted to ask about Trump’s plan to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election victory to return himself to office. Ivanka Trump was close to the former president in the days leading up to the Capitol attack, Thompson said, and appeared to have learned the plan to have the then vice-president, Mike Pence, refuse to certify Biden’s election win in certain states was possibly unlawful. “The committee has information suggesting that President Trump’s White House counsel may have concluded that the actions President Trump directed Vice-President Pence to take would … otherwise be illegal. Did you discuss these issues?” the letter said.The letter added House investigators had additional questions about whether Ivanka Trump could say whether the former president had been told that such an action might be unlawful, and yet nonetheless persisted in pressuring Pence to reinstall him for a second term. Thompson also said in the letter that the panel wanted to learn more about Trump’s indifference to the insurrection, and discussions inside the White House about his tweet castigating Pence for not adopting his plan as a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol in his name. The letter said a persistent question for Ivanka Trump – who White House aides thought had the best chance of persuading the former president to condemn the rioters – was what she did about the situation and why her father did not call off the rioters in a White House address.The select committee said in the letter that they also wanted to ask her about what she knew with regard to the long delay in deploying the national guard to the Capitol, which allowed the insurrection to overwhelm law enforcement into the afternoon of 6 January.Thompson said that House investigators were curious why there appeared to have been no evidence that Trump issued any order to request the national guard, or called the justice department to request the deployment of personnel to the Capitol. A spokesperson for the select committee declined to comment on whether the panel was considering a subpoena for Ivanka Trump or the content of the Friday meeting. Neither a spokesperson for the former president nor Ivanka Trump responded to requests for comment. But Ivanka Trump has appeared to suggest she is not prepared to appear voluntarily, and said in a statement at the time of the letter requesting voluntary cooperation that “as the committee already knows, Ivanka did not speak at the January 6 rally”.",News/US news,US Capitol attack panel discusses subpoena for Ivanka Trump,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/17/us-capitol-attack-ivanka-trump-subpoena-discussion
2/17/2022,"Campaigners are celebrating a victory in the battle for public access to the countryside, after the government agreed to cancel a deadline to register forgotten footpaths. Walkers and horse riders had been given until 1 January 2026 to apply to save any rights of way through private land that existed before 1949 but did not appear on official maps, after which they would lose the opportunity to add them to maps.  A clause in right-to-roam legislation introduced by the Labour government in 2000 stated that any pre-1949 paths must be recorded by 2026 to continue to carry public rights. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act contained a provision that will extinguish those rights if the paths have not been properly recorded. In 2015 campaigners including Ramblers raised the alarm about the need to register the paths, with Dr Phil Wadey, a space satellite scientist and vice-chair of the conservation body Open Spaces Society, telling the Guardian: “These paths are all over the place. A lot of them are actually paths that are in everyday use. They are not hidden. We are not talking about paths that have fallen into disuse. There are actually people walking or riding or cycling along them. But they are not on the official map, so they will vanish if applications are not made … People won’t realise until they are gone and then it will be too late.” The deadline had already been abolished in Wales. The announcement was made by Ramblers, which campaigns for public access to the countryside, after its representatives received assurances from the government in a stakeholder meeting on Wednesday. The charity said it had identified 41,000 miles of potentially missing rights of way to be investigated and applied for in England. But it was not just countryside rights of way that were at risk. Experts have previously told the Guardian that urban alleyways were also at risk, with shortcuts behind houses under threat from homeowners extending their gardens, or fencing-off paths that had existed for decades. Jack Cornish, head of paths for Ramblers, called the U-turn “a cause for celebration”. “This welcome decision means that, with the help of our brilliant volunteers, we’ll be able to make sure the most important and useful paths are added back to the map and protected for future generations,” Cornish said. “As well as being an important part of our history, our path network makes a huge difference to our health and wellbeing. We’re more aware than ever of how good it is for us to be able to easily get outdoors into green spaces, and this is a step in the right direction for the government towards making it a reality for more people to enjoy the benefits of walking and connecting with nature.” A Defra spokesperson said: “Public access is key to connecting people with the environment to improve health and wellbeing. “The government has decided to take forward a streamlined package of measures in order to help enhance the way that rights of way are recorded and managed.”",News/UK news,Deadline to register England’s footpaths cancelled after public access campaign,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/17/deadline-to-register-englands-footpaths-cancelled-after-public-access-campaign
2/17/2022,"We are living in the age of the scammer. If you weren’t aware of it, just turn on your TV: there’s a rash of real-life dramas about master con artists. Netflix’s Inventing Anna – a fictionalised account of the fake heiress Anna Delvey (real name Sorokin) – is topping the streaming service’s popularity chart, while in March, Disney+ is releasing The Dropout, which dramatises the tale of health-tech fraud Elizabeth Holmes. It’s no wonder that the New Yorker’s Rachel Syme has declared a “Scam Spring”.  Each of these stories is stranger than fiction, and has already spawned podcast series and investigative magazine features. But the drive to turn them into glossy, high-end TV dramas with star-studded casts suggests that we view their protagonists as more than mere tricksters: we are intrigued, even beguiled by them. Perhaps that’s because at the heart of each of their stories lies a question: did they really believe that their visions would become a reality? Or were they out to scam people from the start? The Dropout shows Holmes (played by Amanda Seyfried) being told that there is no way a pin-prick blood test to accurately detect myriad illnesses could ever work; but wide-eyed, on she continues, lying to investors – and, horrifyingly, to patients. In Inventing Anna, Delvey (Julia Garner) screams at her tech-bro boyfriend that of course her arts foundation – named after herself, naturally – will succeed, because she deserves it. There are echoes of Billy McFarland’s disastrous Fyre festival, immortalised in 2019’s Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened – McFarland believed he could pull off a luxury, A-lister music festival on a Caribbean island, despite never having worked a day in events production in his life. What the now-convicted Sorokin, McFarland and Holmes have in common – apart from being venture capitalist-whisperers with a staggering level of entitlement – is that their trajectory seems to coincide with the rise of the concept of “hustle” on social media. Within this culture – which appears to be most prevalent on the image-based site Instagram, with #hustle appearing 28.7m times, shortly followed by #grind on 24.8m posts – wealth and success are prized above all, with the myth reinforced by influencers that if you just #hustle hard enough, the world is yours for the taking. The logic then follows that if you’re in poverty, disadvantaged or unsuccessful, well, that’s because you didn’t go to the lengths to get where you want to be in the future, to paraphrase Love Island influencer Molly-Mae Hague. Self-belief and positive thinking are all well and good, but left unchecked, they can push people into a distorted reality. A 2018 survey found that 53% of millennials expected to become a millionaire at some point in the future; but the real story is far more sobering: in 2019, millennials were less wealthy than people of a similar age in any year from 1989 to 2007. So perhaps it makes sense that people retreat to spaces online where dreams feel as if they can become a reality. An Instagram account such as Success Factory Global (bio: Helping YOU win the game called “LIFE”!; followers: 363,000), demonstrates how wellness-centred self-help memes are colliding with crypto-tech lad culture. Here, in posts such as “The goal is to be a legend” and “You will be the first millionaire in your family” (or, weirdly, over the top of the a picture of Cillian Murphy as murderous gangland boss Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders: “They will ignore you until they need you”), the message is clear: let nothing stand in your way of success. Fake it ’til you make it, just like Anna Delvey’s carefully curated Instagram image of a fine art-loving German trust fund girl – an image that made her high-profile friends and scored her meetings with investors. The prioritising of appearance over reality on social media could, perhaps, be driving the latest spate of scammers – and our fascination with them. Holmes, McFarland and Sorokin took ideas that eventually might have worked, and pushed on regardless, breaking the law in the process, when confronted with the reality that it wasn’t likely to happen. Yon Motskin, co-creator of HBO’s Generation Hustle – a sort of greatest hits of the scam world documentary, released last year – recently told Salon: “They have grown up in a different generation, right? It’s this ‘fake it ’til you make it’ generation people now. We live online, we post half-truths all the time, all day without ever thinking twice about the morals of it. So I think all these cons were an extension of that.” Meanwhile, one of Sorokin’s victims, Rachel Williams – who is fictionalised in Inventing Anna – has criticised the TV series, telling Vanity Fair it was was “dangerous”, as “hunger for this type of entertainment urges media companies to make more of it, incentivising people like Anna and making [crime] seem like a viable career path”. Of course, there will always be people out to scam others outright (as the pandemic depressingly demonstrated), and most of us would draw the line at criminality when it comes to keeping up with the Kardashians. But perhaps what these stories of scammers show, more than anything, is that rather than being surrounded by yes people, we could all do with being told “no” once in a while.

2/17/2022,"Rescheduled match will cost me £356 I bought three tickets for this month’s Premier League match between Arsenal and Liverpool from Seatsbay.com. The fixture has been postponed, and since we live in Germany, we can’t easily attend a rescheduled game. I asked for a refund, but Seatsbay says it would only refund 60% of the ticket price which, as I paid £890, is a loss of £356. Do I have a case?’JM, Berlin, Germany  The law is unambiguous when an event is cancelled. The customer should get a refund. Rescheduling is one of those notorious grey areas. The now defunct Office of Fair Trading ordered football clubs to refund fans in full if they could not attend a rescheduled match. However, those who buy from unofficial resellers have fewer protections. Seatsbay says its refund policy is in its terms and conditions. “Refunds will not be issued if the date changes, as we spent time and money getting the tickets,” it says. “This is not something we try to hide, or that is written in small print.” In fact, the relevant clause is a line of small print half way down the voluminous terms and conditions. According to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), refund rights depend on the seller’s terms and conditions, but those which exclude a refund in any circumstances are likely to be unfair and unenforceable, while any deductions should be reasonable. Gary Rycroft, partner of law firm Joseph A Jones & Co, says the CMA should investigate opaque fees. “In law you should not expect to be refunded booking fees if an event is postponed, but, in my view, to comply with the Consumer Rights Act, deductions should be transparent from the outset.” Seatsbay declined to tell me what its service fees are. Perhaps the real issue is the hugely inflated prices charged by secondary ticket sellers. Arsenal’s top price ticket is £97. You were charged £296. It is, in fact, illegal in England and Wales for unauthorised firms to resell football tickets. Seatsbay confirms it is not affiliated to any club. “Since we are not in England or Wales, and as transactions are not made there, there is nothing illegal,” it says.

2/17/2022,"Before a recent trip to Málaga, I booked a Hertz hire car for a week through a broker and paid for comprehensive insurance cover. At the airport, the Hertz staff insisted this policy was invalid in Spain, and I needed to pay €197 (£167) for its SuperCover excess-waiver policy, which removes the excess in the event of a claim. I was also told the two baby seats I had booked would cost an extra €168. What started as a £372 car hire ended up costing £711 after VAT. When I complained to head office I was sent a €40 (£33) voucher.AOT, Brighton, East Sussex Car rental companies are notorious for luring customers in with budget quotes, then inflating the price with hidden add-ons. Unwanted insurance cover is a favourite extra. You can buy excess-waiver cover, which reduces the insurance excess payable in the event of an accident, for about £2 a day from a third-party broker, while some hire firms charge three-figure sums and claim a rental is not valid without it.  Hertz’s response is bizarre. First it says that all the charges were correct and that you should not, therefore, have been offered the voucher. It then stated that you could keep what it calls “the partial goodwill refund” because it misunderstood your original complaint.

2/17/2022,"Amnesty International has said attacks against its operations in Thailand were taking place against a backdrop of “growing intolerance for human rights discourse” among the country’s authorities, and warned of a clampdown on civil society groups. Amnesty has come under increased pressure in Thailand, where ultra royalists have accused it of threatening national security and interfering in the country’s internal affairs after it criticised legal cases filed against monarchy reform protesters.In November, prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha ordered an investigation into the NGO, while royalist groups have organised petitions calling for it to be expelled from the country.  On Thursday morning, a small group of protesters gathered outside the Ministry of Interior, holding signs that said “Get out from Thailand”, and submitted a letter calling for an end to Amnesty’s presence in the country, according to footage broadcast on online news. Seksakol Atthawong, a vice minister in Prayuth’s office, who has organised a petition against the NGO, said last week that it had attracted 1.2m signatures. Amnesty has provoked the anger of royalist groups by condemning court judgments against young protesters who led mass rallies calling for curbs to be placed on the wealth and influence of the royal family. Prior to the protests, which peaked in 2020, the royal family had long been considered beyond direct public criticism. It is also protected by a lese majesty law that states anyone who “defames, insults or threatens” the monarchy can face up to 15 years in prison. At least 1,767 people, including hundreds of children aged under 18, have been charged under various laws for expressing political opinions or taking part in rallies, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. In November, the constitutional court ruled that the protesters’ calls for reform amounted to attempts to overthrow the monarchy – a judgment that Amnesty said was “a dangerous warning to hundreds of thousands of Thais who want to express their opinions or legitimate criticisms”. Alongside petitions against Amnesty, NGOs have also raised concerns over a proposed law that aims to regulate non-profits in Thailand. It is widely opposed by civil society groups who warn that its terms are vague, overly broad and could easily be misused. Amnesty said it could have “severe consequences” for all NGOs in Thailand. Kyle Ward, Amnesty International’s Deputy secretary general, said: “The targeting of Amnesty is taking place against a backdrop of a growing intolerance for human rights discourse among Thai authorities.” In a statement, Ward said: “We offer constructive recommendations to authorities on steps they can take to uphold their international human rights obligations. We will continue to do this independently and impartially on the basis of facts. In response to the anti-Amnesty campaign and related investigation, we continue to answer any questions the Thai government may have about our work in the country. “While we recognise that the royal Thai government has a duty to protect public order and national security, we continue to highlight that the authorities must do so in a manner that is in accordance with international human rights law, and that is proportionate, necessary and fulfils the government’s obligations to ensure and facilitate respect for human rights, including the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.” ",News/World news,Amnesty faces pressure to leave Thailand amid ‘growing intolerance’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/amnesty-faces-pressure-to-leave-thailand-amid-growing-intolerance
2/17/2022,"Hello – great that you could join me, Warren Murray, for today’s briefing.  A new attempt will be made to force publication of the full Sue Gray report on whether No 10 parties broke Covid laws. If passed, the “humble address” motion tabled in the House of Commons by the Lib Dems would compel ministers to release the documents within two days of the Met concluding its investigation. A vote could take place next week, with Tory MPs urged to give their support. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said Johnson “can’t be trusted to admit whether he or any other Conservative ministers end up being fined by the police … If Johnson is found to have broken the law, he must fess up and resign.” The papers demanded include an unredacted version of Sue Gray’s report, all accompanying evidence collected by the Cabinet Office, and a list of Downing Street staff issued with a fixed penalty notice. Despite the prime minister having attended some of the events under scrutiny, he has continued to deny any wrongdoing and has avoided a no-confidence vote. ‘Ending free testing a mistake’ – Cabinet splits have emerged over the “living with Covid” strategy, with the health secretary, Sajid Javid, expected to push to retain some free testing and community surveillance in the face of Treasury demands to slash the Covid budget by up to 90%. Javid and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, are expected to meet over it today. Whitehall sources say Javid’s health department wants enough free testing to ensure the survival of the Panoramic antiviral drugs trial. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said on Wednesday that “ending free testing is a mistake, [as] Covid isn’t going away”. Javid is also expected to argue to keep a scaled-back version of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection survey, which shows the prevalence of Covid and is considered a gold standard in the world. UK-Australia defence deal – Boris Johnson has signed off on a £25m security package with Australia as the UK looks to build on its defence pact with Canberra. The UK investment will see £25m committed to projects in the Indo-Pacific designed to “strengthen resilience in cyberspace, state threats and maritime security”, Downing Street has said. Australia, the UK and the US have already signed up to a pact, dubbed Aukus, to develop nuclear-powered submarines for Australia. ‘Political’ warning fraught for schools – New government guidance on political impartiality in the classroom is likely to scare teachers in England away from tackling important subjects, according to education unions. The guidance says recent “particularly contentious and disputed” historical events, such as “many topics relating to empire and imperialism” should be taught “in a balanced manner”. In teaching of scientific facts around climate change, teachers are told potential solutions “may constitute a political issue”. The guidance says Black Lives Matter is a movement whose campaigning goes beyond the “basic shared principle that racism is unacceptable”. Mary Bousted from the National Education Union suggested the guidance could see hugely important issues such as the climate crisis, racism and world poverty cordoned off from discussion as too political. The Association of School and College Leaders said it would study the guidance carefully. ‘If you’re black, assimilate’ – A reporter has told how he infiltrated the French far-right presidential candidate Éric Zemmour’s election team for more than three months. Vincent Bresson, 27, said he became part of “Génération Z” – Zemmour’s young supporters group – where he witnessed multiple racist remarks from both volunteers and senior staff. “Officially, if you’re black or of Arab origin, Zemmour believes in ‘assimilation’: work hard, adapt to ‘French culture’, and you can be French ‘like the rest’,” said Bresson. Zemmour denies he is racist but has two convictions for racist hate speech and is appealing against a third. He is vying for third place in the polls with the rightwing Les Républicains candidate Valérie Pécresse, behind the far-right National Rally leader, Marine Le Pen, and the incumbent president, Emmanuel Macron. Quick diagnosis for brain disorders – A simple test could end years of uncertainty for people with relatively common neurological conditions such as Huntington’s disease and frontal lobe dementia. Researchers say whole genome sequencing (WGS) can quickly and accurately detect the most common inherited neurological disorders, and could be implemented with immediate effect. It is already offered to people in England with rare disorders or childhood cancers. The new test uses an algorithm to compare a healthy genome with a damaged one, shortening diagnostic processes that sometimes take years. “Here in a single test, we have the capacity to diagnose the most common neurological diseases,” said Prof Sir Mark Caulfield from Queen Mary University of London. The Duke of York faces a bill of millions of pounds after settling a sexual assault case with his accuser, Virginia Giuffre.

The booming crypto assets market could pose a serious threat to financial stability if regulators fail to take action, a global watchdog has said. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is worried that the scale and nature of crypto markets poses the sort of risk that sub-prime mortgages contained and which sparked the financial crisis of 2007-8.

The Guardian front page this morning says “Covid jab programme extended to cover all children aged five to 11”. The rollout is set to begin in April in pharmacies, GP surgeries and vaccination centres, using Pfizer/BioNTech doses. It is in line with a recommendation by the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation. The Telegraph’s lead story is about the Ukraine crisis – “Truss: Putin could drag out crisis for months”. The latter paper also carries a front-page picture of the Queen back at work, accompanying its report about police investigating an alleged “cash for honours” scheme involving an aide to Prince Charles. Other papers wrap that together with the House of Windsor’s other problems stemming from Prince Andrew. “Plutonium Jubilee” says the Metro. The Sun has “Thank God for the Queen” and “Frail monarch soldiers on”. The Mirror goes with “Royals in crisis” and “Reign storm”. The Daily Mail headline explains: “Charles facing police quiz over cash for honours”. The theme continues – the Express says “Queen faces new anguish” and the Times has “Cash for honours inquiry deepens crisis for royals”.

2/17/2022,"By the middle of the century, our planet will need to feed almost 10 billion people, according to the UN. To do this sustainably and limit global heating to 1.5C, the world must also reforest on a huge scale, say scientists, while increasing food production without converting more rainforest and wetland into farmland. It is an intractable challenge. With vast areas of forest, grasslands and savannah already lost to expanding agricultural frontiers and resource extraction in the last century, the competition for space, dubbed “the land squeeze” by the World Resources Institute (WRI), will put unprecedented pressure on Earth’s planetary boundaries.  Government incentives will play an important role in reconciling the competing demands on our planet’s resources. But new research reveals at least $1.8tn (£1.3tn) of environmentally harmful subsidies is heading in the wrong direction, financing the annihilation of wildlife and global heating through support for cattle ranching, pesticide use, the overproduction of crops and fossil fuel extraction. “In a situation where, as a civilisation, we are dying from climate change and biodiversity loss, we should not be spending money on making the situation worse,” says Ariel Brunner, head of policy for BirdLife Europe and Central Asia. “The biggest threats to our ability to feed ourselves are climate change and environmental collapse. We have enough food. The only scenarios in which we wouldn’t have enough are linked to running out of water, soil erosion and the collapse of ecosystems.” The report, produced by leading subsidy experts for the B Team and Business for Nature, estimated that, each year, there is at least $640bn of environmentally damaging financial support for the fossil fuel industry, $520bn for agriculture and $350bn for the unsustainable use of freshwater. Examples range from subsidies for soy production in the Amazon and palm oil plantations in south-east Asia to artificially low energy prices for groundwater pumping in Iran and poor water management in California. Despite a target on redirecting subsidies in the draft UN biodiversity agreement, repurposing them will not be easy. The B Team argues that the UN target should be strengthened to eradicate all environmentally harmful subsidies – not just the $500bn drafted at the moment – and businesses must reveal the support and subsidies they receive through environmental disclosures. But there is also political jeopardy. Governments have never met a UN target on halting the destruction of nature, with failure to act on subsidies highlighted as a key failure of last decade’s targets. Recent protests in France, Kazakhstan and Nigeria over the threatened loss of subsidies are warnings to leaders on how subsidy reform can go wrong. Costa Rica is a high-profile example of how government support can strike the balance between nature and agriculture. The country’s payments for ecosystem services programme, which won the inaugural Earthshot prize last year, helped halt and reverse what had been one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world in the 1970s and 1980s, while maintaining the production of bananas, pineapple, coffee and other crops. Chile, Ghana, Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru have similar schemes where landowners are paid for environmental services, albeit on a smaller scale, helping to combat rural poverty and the climate crisis. “We have to restore ecosystems to be able to feed more people, not just for biodiversity,” says Helen Ding, an environmental economist with the WRI, who led research on repurposing farm subsidies in August last year. The research argued that redirecting subsidies to support agroforestry and low-carbon agriculture, especially among small farmers, who produce a large proportion of the world’s food supply, could improve soil quality and the ecological health of land without affecting bottom lines. “Farmers do need to receive subsidies, especially after the Covid pandemic. Rural communities have to recover from the economic shock. But we do know there are subsidies that are inefficient and are driving deforestation,” says Ding. While the postwar expansion of fertiliser and pesticide use alongside technological support lifted millions out of poverty, some well-intentioned schemes are not achieving their aims, according to the WRI report. In Malawi, the government spent about 60% of its annual agricultural budget on farming input subsidies like fertiliser after food instability in the early 2000s. Over time, the initial increase in maize yields fell while the soil was also damaged. Ding’s report argues that such schemes could be changed to benefit both farmers and the environment. Either way, the $1.8tn calculated in the new research is likely to be a gross underestimate of the true scale of environmentally harmful subsidies, say the report’s authors, Doug Koplow and Ronald Steenblik. A year after the review by Cambridge economist Prof Sir Partha Dasgupta of the failure of economics to take into account the rapid depletion of the natural world ahead of Cop26, there is little sign so-called “natural capital” has gone mainstream. The human-driven sixth mass extinction of life on Earth continues to be subsidised with public money. “We found at least $1.8tn a year in subsidies. What was equally striking to me is how much we couldn’t find out. There were no estimates of water for direct withdrawals by industry and agriculture, even though that’s just a massive use of freshwater around the world,” says Koplow, founder of the organisation Earth Track, which monitors environmentally harmful subsidies. “My hope is that this report restarts a critical conversation.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Harmful subsidies: why is the world still funding the destruction of nature?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/17/harmful-subsidies-why-is-the-world-still-funding-the-destruction-of-nature-aoe
