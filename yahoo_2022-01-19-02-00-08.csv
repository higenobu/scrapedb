1/19/2022,"Justice Sonia Sotomayor was forced to attend oral arguments remotely because Justice Neil Gorsuch wasn't wearing a mask. Chief Justice John Roberts reportedly asked the entire court to mask up on Sotomayor's behalf. All of the justices are fully vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who has diabetes and is at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, has been participating in Supreme Court oral arguments remotely from her private chambers after Justice Neil Gorsuch refused to wear a mask, according to NPR's Nina Totenberg in a report published Tuesday. Sotomayor has not taken the bench this year amid the nationwide surge in COVID-19 cases driven by the highly contagious Omicron variant. The remaining eight justices have appeared in the courtroom for arguments, with each of them wearing masks, except for Gorsuch. The nine justices first returned to in-person arguments last fall since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. At the time, none of the justices wore masks during oral arguments besides Sotomayor, per NPR. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that either type of diabetes could make a person more susceptible to a severe illness from COVID-19. Though as coronavirus infections began to spike recently, Chief Justice John Roberts ""in some form"" asked the entire court to mask up on behalf of Sotomayor, according to NPR. All of them did, with the exception of Gorsuch. Based on the court's tradition, Sotomayor, appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009, sits next to Gorsuch, appointed by President Donald Trump in 2017, on the bench. Sotomayor does not feel safe around unmasked individuals and has been participating remotely, per NPR. All nine justices are fully vaccinated and have received booster shots against COVID-19. ""[Gorsuch's] continued refusal since then has also meant that Sotomayor has not attended the justices' weekly conference in person, joining instead by telephone,"" NPR reported. A Supreme Court spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Gorsuch's behalf. Totenberg, a longtime Supreme Court reporter, also described an institution that's overflowing with animosity. The court's three liberals, including Sotomayor, are increasingly upset with their conservative colleagues, especially over the possibility that Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, could soon be overturned.  The justices recently split along ideological lines in a 6-3 decision blocking the Biden administration's mandate that would have required private companies with over 100 employees to get their workers vaccinated against COVID-19 or weekly tested. The court's conservative majority expressed skepticism of the Biden administration's power to impose a sweeping mandate on workplaces without direct authorization from Congress. The three liberals disagreed, writing in a dissenting opinion: ""When we are wise, we know enough to defer on matters like this one. When we are wise, we know not to displace the judgments of experts, acting within the sphere Congress marked out and under Presidential control, to deal with emergency conditions. Today, we are not wise.""

1/19/2022,"A Georgia football player might have done too much celebrating after the team returned from Indianapolis from winning the national title last week. Long snapper William Mote was arrested and faces a charge of criminal damage to property in the early morning of Jan. 12 after police allege he destroyed a single pane window of an Athens downtown law office. Mote told Athens-Clarke County police he was intoxicated after drinking at the Silver Dollar Bar, went to see a friend and mistakenly went to the law office, according to a police incident report. The incident at about 5 a.m. came the morning after the team returned to Athens from the win over Alabama. He was booked into the Clarke County Jail and released on a $1,300 bond about four and a half hours later. Mote, a redshirt sophomore walk-on from Hoover, Ala., served as the long snapper for punter Jake Camarda the past two seasons. Mote was charged with a felony in the second degree for the damage of more than $500 at the law office of Blassingame, Burch, Garrard & Ashley at 440 College Ave. Georgia athletics did not respond to comment on the incident. Police were called when a burglar alarm was set off by the broken window. An officer saw a white male in a hoodie kicking the public defender’s door. Mote was detained because the officer thought it was a burglary in progress. He told police he was walking home and saw a homeless person who asked him to help him get warm and that’s why he was kicking the public defender’s office door. Mote was asked about the law office window and said he didn’t know about it and couldn’t have broken it. Since Mote was actively attempting to damage other property, police decided to charge Mote, according to the incident report.

1/19/2022,"Donald Trump had something important to say as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day drew to a close on Monday. Since Twitter banned him following the attack on the Capitol, the former president has made the bulk of his announcements through his Save America PAC. This one, however, came on his taxpayer-funded office’s letterhead, complete with what appears to be the presidential seal. It must be something really important, then, not just his a typical attack against Joe Biden or Mitch McConnell or his other innumerable enemies. “I have just spent millions of dollars on the Blue Monster golf course at Trump National Doral in the heart of Miami,” the statement began before announcing a plan for a new luxury housing development, which he described as the “most exciting” in the country. He closed by claiming that Doral’s golf courses are “setting records.” More from Rolling Stone Florida Guys: Trump and DeSantis Are Done Playing Nice Trump Admin's Census Interference Was 'Unprecedented,' Newly Disclosed Internal Email Shows They're Too Extreme for QAnon -- and Right at Home at Trump's Rally Trump using the office of the president to promote his personal businesses isn’t anything out of the ordinary, but it seems especially strange in this case given that he’s no longer the president and could have just as easily made the announcement on letterhead that isn’t funded by taxpayers. Trump National Doral has seen some hard times. The Washington Post noted in 2019 that the property was in “steep decline,” and the pandemic didn’t help matters. Forbes noted last January that sales dropped at least $33 million in 2020. It’s a safe bet that Trump is the only person in America who thinks slapping some luxury condos onto the property amounts to “the most exciting development in the country.” Trump’s claim that Doral’s signature Blue Monster course is a “favorite of PGA tour players” is also dubious. The course hasn’t hosted a PGA Tour event since the WGC moved to Mexico City in 2016. Trump responded to the news by writing that he hopes the PGA has “kidnapping insurance.” The course itself isn’t anything special, either, as golf writer Rick Reilly explained to Rolling Stone in 2019. “The reason he doesn’t have a single course in the top 150 in America, even though he says he’s got the greatest collection of courses, which is bullshit, is because he goes too big,” Reilly said of the Blue Monster. “Big greens, big bunkers, big fairways, big waterfalls. The great courses in America — like Riviera, Bandon Dunes, Pebble Beach — they have some great small holes, and holes that feel organic to the land.” Trump’s big real estate news wasn’t the only statement he made on MLK Day. The former president kicked off the federal holiday meant to memorialize the civil rights leader by asking his followers an important question. “Will Morning Joe be canceled?” he wrote before bashing MSNBC. Trump did not mention MLK in the statement, which he at least made on his PAC’s letterhead, but he did manage to call MSNBC host Joy Reid a “racist.” Best of Rolling Stone The Useful Idiots New Guide to the Most Stoned Moments of the 2020 Presidential Campaign Anatomy of a Fake News Scandal The Radical Crusade of Mike Pence",Politics/Rolling Stone,Trump Caps MLK Day by Using Taxpayer-Funded Office to Promote Golf Course Renovations,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-caps-mlk-day-using-144645994.html
1/19/2022,"A professor accused of treating a pair of PhD students like slaves by asking them to do her gardening, redecorate her home and go underwear shopping has won a £15,000 payout after a tribunal ruled she was wrongly sacked. Prof Shuang Cang from Northumbria University was investigated by police for modern day slavery offences after two postgraduate students alleged they were “just servants to her”. The PhD students, from China, claimed Prof Cang forced them to cut down trees in her garden, move heavy furniture, dispose of her rubbish and pay for meals, an employment tribunal heard. Chinese-born Prof Cang, 59, who has worked in the UK for 30 years, was also accused of demanding the pair be available to her 12 hours a day to run errands. The students, both in their 30s, said they feared they would not be awarded their doctorates if they did not comply with the academic's demands. One of the students said it was Chinese culture to “do what teachers say”. During the lengthy police investigation, Prof Cang denied the allegations or insisted they were exaggerated in what she claimed was a “collaborated attack” against her. Although detectives dropped their slavery investigation into her, the “excellent” and “impressive” professor was sacked by the university for gross misconduct. Now, the tribunal has ruled that Prof Cang was wrongfully dismissed with a judge saying the panel couldn’t be sure the accusations were true. The tribunal, in Newcastle, heard that Prof Cang joined the university’s faculty of business and law on a salary of £63,000 from Bournemouth University in February 2018. Her Chinese PhD students both claim they were “coerced ” to relocate from Bournemouth, with the threat of them failing their PhD. One student, named only as “ZW”, was a 34-year-old man from Shanghai, while the other, “DC”, was a married woman in her 30s. Allegations listed in a tribunal report included: “Oppression and exploitation of students by forcing them to carry out physical work in her house such as furniture moving, garbage disposal, garden clearance, cleaning and painting rooms.” The report also said: “Prof Cang shouts and yells at [DC] in public and, despite DC saying she felt uncomfortable, had made her go on a shopping trip to buy underwear including helping Prof Cang to undress and expressing an opinion on the underwear she was trying on.” But Prof Cang, who was “visibly shocked” when she was arrested, said the allegations were unfounded and that she enjoyed good relationships with the pair and considered them “like her own children”. She said the only chores she could remember them doing was the washing up and half an hour’s worth of ironing. The tribunal also heard there were “serious concerns” that ZW had committed plagiarism and he cannot now be found, while DC may have had a “motive to lie or exaggerate” to obtain an extension of time granted to study in the UK. Tudor Garnon, the employment judge, said he could not be sure the allegations were true and criticised university academics Prof John Wilson, for his investigation, and Prof John Woodward for the disciplinary hearing he chaired. Judge Garnon said: “There are huge gaps in the questioning of the students and areas of their evidence which needed to be investigated further to look for real corroboration or the lack of it. “Based on what we know now and with the obvious gaps in the questioning of ZW and DC, we are not satisfied the university has shown the serious allegations of Prof Cang taking advantage of them to be more likely than not to have happened."" Prof Cang won £14,884 for wrongful dismissal, £2,234 for untaken annual leave, and £30.34 for unpaid expenses. She lost claims of discrimination and harassment based on race and must pay a £1,000 deposit to the university.",World/The Telegraph,Professor accused of treating PhD students like slaves wins £15k payout,https://news.yahoo.com/professor-accused-treating-phd-students-144939516.html
1/19/2022,"Alabama coach Nick Saban and NBA legend Jerry West are among five prominent West Virginia sports figures pushing Sen. Joe Manchin (D) to support the Freedom to Vote Act. Manchin and Sen. Krysten Sinema (D-Ariz.) have refused to support making a filibuster exception for the voting rights bill. A bill can be filibustered in the Senate if it doesn't have 60 votes; if the voting rights bill was exempt from the filibuster and Manchin and Sinema voted for it, the bill would pass a 50-50 Senate by virtue of a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Kamala Harris. The letter, also signed by former West Virginia athletic director Oliver Luck, former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, and former Buffalo Bills linebacker Darryl Talley, urges “Congress to exercise its Constitutional responsibility to enact laws that set national standards for the conduct of Federal elections and for decisions that determine election outcomes.” An excerpt of the letter is below. You can view it in full here. Elections open to all Americans: Our democracy is at its best when all Americans are encouraged to participate. We support measures to provide voters with arange of opportunities to obtain and cast a lawful ballot, including robust in-person, early, and absentee voting options. We support the use of election security, equipment and record-keeping measures that are reliable and evidence-based, and clearly support the integrity of election processes.  Impartial conduct and score-keeping. Election administration and vote certification must be nonpartisan, professional and transparent. State legislators and other officials cannot apply or change rules, standards or procedures, prospectively or retroactively, in amanner that may nullify Federal election results by excluding voters or overruling voter choices. The voting rights bill would allow for no-excuse absentee voting, expand the voter registration process and make Election Day a federal holiday among other provisions. Republicans have been mostly united in their opposition to the bill and a filibuster exception for it. The letter is perhaps the most outspoken the most successful coach in modern college football has ever been regarding politics, though Saban and West have been longtime supporters of Manchin, a Democratic senator in a state that former president Donald Trump won by nearly 40 points in 2020. Saban was born in West Virginia and West stayed in his home state to play basketball at West Virginia before he was chosen with the No. 2 pick in the 1960 NBA draft. Saban, West and West Virginia coach Bob Huggins endorsed Manchin in an ad a month before his re-elction in November of 2018. Saban, who said he grew up with Manchin in the ad, spoke glowingly of the senator in the commercial.

1/19/2022,"LONDON (AP) — Hundreds of mourners turned out Tuesday in Ireland for the funeral Mass of a 23-year-old elementary school teacher whose slaying has reignited debate about how to tackle violence against women. Police said Tuesday they arrested a man in his 30s on suspicion of murder in the case of Ashling Murphy, a musician and teacher whose body was found on the banks of a canal near the town of Tullamore in central Ireland on Jan. 12. The killing has touched a nerve with many women in Ireland and beyond, because media reports suggested that Murphy was targeted when she was out jogging in the afternoon. Vigils have been held across the European Union country — as well as in cities like London and New York — calling for more to be done to combat violence against women. Bishop Tom Deenihan told mourners that the killing was a “depraved act of violence” that united the country in grief. Irish Premier Micheal Martin and President Michael Higgins were among the huge crowds who gathered for the funeral in the small village of Mountbolus. Young children from the school where Murphy taught provided a guard of honor outside the parish church where the funeral was held, some holding up roses and photographs of Murphy. A large screen was set up in the local community center near the church to accommodate the crowds of people paying their respects. Schools across Ireland observed a minute of silence in Murphy’s memory. Ireland's justice minister has said she planned to publish a new national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in the coming months.",World/Associated Press,Irish mourn slain 23-year-old teacher who was out jogging,https://news.yahoo.com/irish-mourn-slain-23-old-154452555.html
