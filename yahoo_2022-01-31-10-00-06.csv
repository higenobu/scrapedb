Her family confirmed Kryst‚Äôs death in a Sunday statement. ‚ÄúHer great light was one that inspired others around the world with her beauty and strength,‚Äù it read. ‚ÄúShe cared, she loved, she laughed and she shined.‚Äù The family said that the pageant-winner had ‚Äúembodied love and served others‚Äù and that ‚Äúher impact will live on.‚Äù Her body was found on the sidewalk outside the Orion Condominium building in Midtown just after 7 a.m. Kryst lived on the ninth floor of the building, according to the New York Post. She was last seen on a terrace 29 stories above the ground. Though her family did not provide a cause of death, sources in the New York Police Department have confirmed that Kryst had died by suicide, according to the Post and The Hollywood Reporter. The Post reported that Kryst had left behind a note leaving her possessions to her mother. ‚ÄúMay this day bring you peace and rest,‚Äù Kryst wrote in an Instagram caption posted just hours before her fatal fall. Following news of her death, tributes from friends and fans poured in. ‚ÄúRest peacefully sister,‚Äù Olivia Jordan, who won the Miss USA title in 2015, wrote on Kryst‚Äôs final Instagram post. ‚ÄúThe world will miss you and the light you shone so bright.‚Äù The 30-year-old began competing in pageants as a teenager, following in the footsteps of her mother, who was crowned Mrs. North Carolina U.S. in 2002. Kryst clinched the Miss North Carolina USA crown in 2019. She went on that same year to win the national Miss USA title. While competing, she remembered in a 2021 essay for Allure magazine, she spoke openly about her views ‚Äúon the legalization of marijuana, the Trump Administration‚Äôs immigration policies, anti-abortion laws, the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and the successes and failures of criminal justice reform.‚Äù ‚ÄúI openly supported the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement and marched in protests over the summer,‚Äù Kryst continued. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt searching to collect more awards or recognition during my reign. Rather, I fed the passion that made waking up each morning feel worthwhile: speaking out against injustice.‚Äù At 28 years old, Kryst became the oldest woman to ever be crowned Miss USA. She went on to also become the longest-reigning victor, thanks to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, holding the title for a record 557 days. Your #MissUSA 2019 is...

1/31/2022,"By Josh Smith SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea confirmed on Monday it had tested a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), state media reported, as U.S. and South Korean officials warned Sunday's launch could lead to resumed testing of long-range weapons and nuclear bombs. It was the seventh conducted by North Korea this month and the first time a nuclear-capable missile of that size had been launched since 2017. The launch was first reported by South Korean and Japanese authorities on Sunday, who condemned it as a threat to regional security. ""The inspection firing test was conducted for the purpose of selectively inspecting the ground-to-ground mid-range long-range ballistic missile Hwasong-12 and verifying the overall accuracy of this weapon system,"" North Korean state news agency KCNA said. North Korea has previously said the Hwasong-12 can carry a ""large-size heavy nuclear warhead."" KCNA said the missile launch was conducted in such a way as to ensure the safety of neighbouring countries, and that the test warhead was fitted with a camera that took photos while it was in space. Photos released by state media showed space-based images of North Korea and the surrounding areas through a round camera lens. North Korea first took such photos in 2017, analysts said. Leader Kim Jong Un was not reported to have attended the test, which was at least the seventh launch in January, one of the busiest ever for North Korea's advancing missile programme. On Sunday South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the launch takes North Korea a step closer to fully scrapping a self-imposed moratorium on testing its longest-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Kim has said he is no longer bound by that moratorium, which included a stop to nuclear weapons tests and was announced in 2018 amid a flurry of diplomacy and summits with then-U.S. President Donald Trump. North Korea suggested this month it could restart those testing activities because the United States and its allies had shown no sign of dropping their ""hostile policies."" BIGGER MISSILES The United States shares the concerns that North Korea's escalating missile tests could be precursors to resumed tests of nuclear weapons and ICBMs, a senior U.S. official said on Sunday night, while urging Pyongyang to join direct talks with no preconditions. ""They are looking to take actions, which we believe are fundamentally destabilizing, as a way to increase pressure,"" the official told a briefing of journalists in Washington. ""I think that there probably is a component that is also to validate the systems that they've developed and further refine them."" It is unclear if IRBMs such as the Hwasong-12 were included in Kim's moratorium, but those, too, have not been tested since 2017. That year North Korea flight-tested the Hwasong-12 at least six times, achieving three successful flights and three failures. Controversially, in two of those tests North Korea launched the missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. In Sunday's test, North Korea said it fired the missile on an elevated trajectory ""in consideration of the safety of neighbouring countries."" The test ""confirmed the accuracy, safety, and operational effectiveness of the produced Hwasong-12 type weapon system,"" KCNA said. The Hwasong-12 has an estimated range of 4,500 kilometres (2,796 miles), which would put the U.S. territory of Guam and the far western tip of Alaska's Aleutian Islands chain within reach, according to the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). By comparison, the largest, most powerful missile North Korea has tested to date is the Hwasong-15 ICBM, with an estimated range of 8,500‚Äì13,000 km, which could threaten anywhere in the United States, CSIS said. The Hwasong-15 was tested once, in November 2017.

1/31/2022,"EDITOR: I recently read the article regarding the 49ers using Bay Port‚Äôs field for practice (""How the NFL's San Francisco 49ers ended up at Bay Port High School, and the viral moment that came from it,"" Scott Venci). As a Bay Port alumni and father I was disappointed to read Nick Bosa using the field as his personal latrine. His actions were viewed by many underaged children, given the social media posts, and was also in the vicinity of an elementary school. I understand this action did not cause unimaginable harm to the kids who witnessed it; in fact, I bet it was a source of excitement and hilarity. However, what disappoints me is the lack of action taken by security/law enforcement. We all know if this were a homeless veteran or any other non-famous, working-class American, campus security and local police would have reacted instantly and without question. That veteran/working-class American might have been arrested for indecent exposure (Class A misdemeanor), charged, fined, and could be placed on a sex offenders list if prosecutors had evidence that he exposed himself. However, due to Nick Bosa‚Äôs status and money he becomes a headline with no real consequences. This inequity in which the law is strictly adhered to when judging lower/working-class Americans and blatantly, flippantly disregarded when reacting to the illegal actions of the rich and famous is disenchanting. This is just a small but profound example of the systemic injustice seen in our judicial system. Getting a mere $1,000 donation from a billion-dollar franchise to have a millionaire piss on our field in view of our children with no consequences: What a deal, but not for us.
