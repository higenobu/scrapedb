4/14/2022,"The mystery of why humans die around 80, while other mammals live far shorter or longer lives, may finally have been solved by scientists. Humans and animals die after amassing a similar number of genetic mutations, researchers have found, suggesting that the speed of DNA errors is critical in determining the lifespan of a species. There are huge variations in the lifespan of mammals in the animal kingdom, from South Asian rats which live for just six months, to bowhead whales which can survive for 200 years. Previously experts have suggested that size is the key to longevity, with smaller animals burning up energy more quickly, requiring a faster cell turnover, which causes a speeder decline. But a new study from the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge suggests it is the speed of genetic damage that could be the key to survival, with long-living animals successfully slowing down their rate of DNA mutations, regardless of their size. It helps explain how a five-inch long naked mole rat can live for 25 years, about the same as a far larger giraffe, which typically lives for 24 years. When scientists checked their mutation rates, they were surprisingly similar. Naked mole rats suffer 93 mutations a year, and giraffes 99. In contrast, mice suffer 796 mutations a year and only live for 3.7 years. The average human lifespan in the study was 83.6 years, but the mutation rate was far lower, at around 47. Genetic changes, known as somatic mutations, occur in all cells and are largely harmless, but some can start a cell on the path to cancer or impair normal functioning. Dr Alex Cagan, the first author of the study, said: “To find a similar pattern of genetic changes in animals as different from one another as a mouse and a tiger was surprising. “But the most exciting aspect of the study has to be finding that lifespan is inversely proportional to the somatic mutation rate. “This suggests that somatic mutations may play a role in ageing.” The team analysed genetic errors in the stem cells from the intestines of 16 species of mammal and found that the longer the lifespan of a species, the slower the rate at which mutations occur. The average number of mutations at the end of lifespan across species was around 3200, suggesting there is a critical mass of errors after which a body is unable to function correctly. Although the figure differed about threefold across species the variation was far less than the variation in body size, which varied up to 40,000 fold. The researchers believe the study opens the door to understanding the ageing process, and the inevitability and timing of death. Dr Inigo Martincorena, the senior author of the study, said: “Ageing is a complex process, the result of multiple forms of molecular damage in our cells and tissues. “Somatic mutations have been speculated to contribute to ageing since the 1950s, but studying them has remained difficult. “With the recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies, we can finally investigate the roles that somatic mutations play in ageing and in multiple diseases.” The research was published in the journal Nature.",Science/The Telegraph,Mystery of why humans die around 80 may finally be solved,https://news.yahoo.com/mystery-why-humans-die-around-173539273.html
4/14/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — Actor Cuba Gooding Jr. pleaded guilty Wednesday to forcibly touching a woman at a New York nightclub in 2018. The guilty plea came nearly three years after the the Oscar-winning “Jerry Maguire” star was arrested in the case that saw several delays as his lawyers sought to get charges reduced or dismissed. Gooding, 54, accused of violating three different women at various Manhattan night spots in 2018 and 2019, pleaded guilty to just one of the allegations. He told the judge he “kissed the waitress on her lips” without consent at the LAVO New York nightclub. Gooding's plea deal calls for no jail time. If he continues counseling for six months, he can withdraw the misdemeanor plea and plead guilty to a lesser violation of harassment. Gooding was arrested in June 2019 after a 29-year-old woman told police he squeezed her breast without her consent at Magic Hour Rooftop Bar & Lounge near Times Square. A few months later, he was charged in two additional cases as more women came forward to accuse him of abuse. The new charges alleged he pinched a server’s buttocks after making a sexually suggestive remark to her at TAO Downtown and forcibly touched a woman inappropriately at the LAVO nightclub, both in 2018. Gooding had previously pleaded not guilty to six misdemeanor counts and denied all allegations of wrongdoing. His lawyers have argued that overzealous prosecutors, caught up in the fervor of the #MeToo movement, are trying to turn “commonplace gestures” or misunderstandings into crimes. The judge had ruled that if the Gooding case went to trial, prosecutors could have called two additional women to testify about their allegations that Gooding also violated them. Those women, whose claims did not result in criminal charges, were among 19 other accusers whom prosecutors were seeking to call as witnesses. Along with the criminal case, Gooding is accused in a lawsuit of raping a woman in New York City in 2013. After a judge issued a default judgment in July because Gooding hadn’t responded to the lawsuit, the actor retained a lawyer and is fighting the allegations.",U.S./Associated Press,Actor Cuba Gooding Jr pleads guilty to forcible touching,https://news.yahoo.com/actor-cuba-gooding-jr-pleads-190715095.html
4/14/2022,"Mako Komuro, formerly known as Princess Mako, left Japan and gave up her royal title after marrying her college sweetheart last year. Mako, the eldest daughter of Japan's Crown Prince Akishino and Crown Princess Kiko, moved to New York City in November 2021 with her husband Kei Komuro. Now, Japan Times reported Mako is assisting curators at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in an unpaid internship capacity. Per the Japan Times, the former Japanese princess is working on an exhibition of hanging-scroll paintings by Okinawan artist Yamada Shinzan, ""inspired by the life of Ippen (1239-1289), a monk who traveled around Japan during the Kamakura Period (1192-1333) introducing Buddhism to the masses by chanting prayers while dancing."" Mako graduated with a degree in art and cultural heritage from the International Christian University in Tokyo, studied art history at the University of Edinburgh, and received her master's in art museum and gallery studies from the University of Leicester. While still a working royal, she also worked at University of Tokyo's University Museum. A former Met curator told People, ""She's qualified and probably handling pieces in the collection. In general, it's work which requires a great deal of preparation and often means spending a lot of time in the library."" Mako isn't alone in growing up royal and pursuing a career in the art world; Britain's Princess Eugenie is an associate director at a London art gallery. Mako's job is reportedly unpaid, but could turn into a full time job. When she left the royal family, Mako chose to give up a dowry of around $1.4 million, making her the first female imperial family member since World War II to opt out of this payment when marrying a commoner. ""Kei is irreplaceable for me. For us, marriage is a necessary choice to live while cherishing our hearts,"" Mako said during a press conference. The media scrutiny around her decision was so extreme that she was diagnosed with PTSD prior to their wedding. Mako's husband Komuro, who attended Fordham Law School, has been clerking for a law firm while he studied to retake the New York bar exam. He reportedly took the exam in February, which means he will find out whether or not he passed in the coming months.

4/14/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said he and his Italian counterpart agreed Tuesday to step up military cooperation as Japan expands security ties with Europe amid concern about Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its impact on Asia. Kishi told reporters that he and Italian Defense Minister Lorenzo Guerini discussed the possible expansion of joint military drills and development of defense technology. Guerini, who is visiting Tokyo, especially expressed interest in possible Italian participation in Japan’s F-X next generation fighter jet, Kishi said, declining to elaborate. It would be Japan’s first domestically developed fighter jet in 40 years. Japan and Britain have agreed to jointly develop a future demonstration fighter jet engine and to explore other combat air technologies and subsystems. The project includes Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and IHI in Japan and Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems in the U.K. The two ministers agreed that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine undermines the foundation of the international order, not only in Europe but also in Asia, and is “absolutely impermissible.” “We agreed on the importance for countries that share fundamental values, such as Japan and Italy, to stick together and act resolutely,"" Kishi said. Kishi said Japan highly regards Italy’s interest and involvement in the Indo-Pacific, where China's increasingly assertive military activity has raised tensions. Japan in recent years has significantly expanded security talks and joint drills with the U.S. and other partners in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe that share its concerns about China’s assertion of its territorial claims in the region, which has some of the world’s busiest sea lanes. Japan is not a NATO member but has strengthened its partnership with the group. It sent Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi to join the NATO foreign ministers' meeting earlier this month to discuss Ukraine. Japan is especially concerned about Chinese military and coast guard activity in the East China Sea near the Japanese-controlled Senkaku islands, which China also claims and calls Diaoyu. China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei have been locked in a tense territorial standoff in the South China Sea for decades.

4/14/2022,"McConnell and his wife Elaine Chao did not know how to deal with Trump after the 2020 election. ""Every day the leader and I wake up saying, 'How do we manage the president?'"" Chao told a friend in December 2020. The comments were reported in a forthcoming book by two New York Times reporters. In the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine Chao, President Donald Trump's transportation secretary, no longer knew how to deal with the president, according to a forthcoming book. ""Every day the leader and I wake up saying, 'How do we manage the president?'"" Chao told a friend in December 2020, per the book. CNN reported on Wednesday on details from the book by New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns. McConnell publicly recognized President Joe Biden's victory on December 15, 2020, after the Electoral College made his win official. Up until then, the Kentucky Republican avoided weighing in on the election results and Trump's false claims about widespread voter fraud. McConnell's acknowledgement of the election results infuriated Trump, and the two haven't spoken to each other since. Chao, for her part, resigned from her cabinet position the day after the January 6 Capitol riot — one of the many high-profile Trump officials who left their posts at the time. Chao had served as transportation secretary since the beginning of the Trump administration. ""Yesterday, our country experienced a traumatic and entirely avoidable event as supporters of the President stormed the Capitol building following a rally he addressed,"" she had said in a statement. ""As I'm sure is the case with many of you, it has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside."" McConnell also forcefully condemned Trump after the riot, for which he said the president was ""practically and morally responsible,"" but voted to acquit him in his second impeachment trial on a charge of ""incitement of insurrection."" The forthcoming book further details McConnell's thinking in the weeks after the election. At the time, McConnell remained focused on the upcoming Georgia runoff elections in January 2021 that would determine which party controls the Senate. Trump had pushed for then-Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, the two Georgia Republicans vying to hold on to their seats, to amplify his claims that the 2020 election was rigged. According to the book, McConnell did not dismiss Trump's claims because he was worried about potentially angering the president and losing the Georgia elections. But privately, McConnell slammed Trump's comments. ""What it looks to me like he's doing is setting this up so he can blame the governor and the secretary of state if we lose,"" McConnell said, per CNN's excerpt. ""He's always setting up somebody to blame it on."" The book, titled ""This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden, and the Battle for America's Future,"" is set for release on May 3.

4/14/2022,"Russians are forcibly sending Ukrainians to remote regions in Russia, Ukrainian officials said. The Kremlin plans on sending them as far as Siberia and the Arctic Circle, The i reported. Nearly 100,000 Ukrainians will be sent to these regions, The i said, citing a Kremlin document. Russia plans to send nearly 100,000 Ukrainians as far as Siberia and the Arctic Circle, UK newspaper The i reported, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned of ""special filtration camps"" for captured people. A Kremlin document, cited by The i, shows Russia made an emergency order last month to forcibly move 95,739 Ukrainians to far-away regions in Russia. The document suggests that Ukrainians will not be sent to major cities like Moscow or St. Petersburg, but rather to remote areas located thousands of miles away from their homes. The areas include the Siberian town of Magadan, the Arctic port of Murmansk, and the Caucasus regions of Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Dagestan, according to The i. Some Ukrainians are also being sent as far as Sakhalin — a Russian island in the Pacific Ocean, located just north of Japan — The i reported. The regions have reportedly been told to update Moscow on new arrivals monthly. The report comes after Ukrainian officials accused Russia of moving thousands of people from Mariupol — a heavily bombarded southern port city in Ukraine — to so-called ""filtration camps"" along the border before forcibly relocating them to far-away regions in Russia. In a speech to the Lithuanian parliament on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said: ""There are mass deportations of people from the occupied areas. Hundreds of thousands of people have already been deported."" ""They are placed in special filtration camps,"" he added. ""Documents are taken away from them. They are interrogated and humiliated. It is unknown how many are killed."" The Mariupol City Council said last month that Russians kidnapped 20,000 of the besieged city's residents. Several women from Mariupol who said they were forced to go to the ""filtration camps"" have since spoken to media outlets, including The Guardian and The Washington Post, about what their experience was like. One unnamed woman told the Post that she was brought via bus to the Ukrainian border town of Novoazovsk after Russian soldiers found her sheltering in an underground bunker. Once in Novoazovsk, the woman told the post she was interrogated by men who said they were part of the Russian security service, the FSB. She said she was photographed and fingerprinted and also had to hand over her phone and passwords. ""At all stages of the journey, we were treated like captives or some criminals. I felt like a sack of potatoes tossed around,"" the woman told the Post. Another unnamed woman told The Guardian that she, alongside ""two or three hundred"" others, faced interrogation and had her personal items confiscated at the ""filtration camp"" in Novoazovsk. ""It was very degrading,"" she told The Guardian about the interrogation. Both women were able to break away from their groups and managed to escape to Europe, according to the Post and The Guardian. Russia has denied that anyone from Ukraine is being relocated against their will, the Post reported. Last month, the Kremlin said it had rescued 420,000 people ""from dangerous regions of Ukraine, the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics"" and evacuated them to Russia, according to the Post.
