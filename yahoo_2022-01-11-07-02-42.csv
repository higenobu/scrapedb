1/11/2022,"The new year is bringing homebuyers and refinancing homeowners something they've been dreading, but expecting: surging mortgage rates. The average rate on America’s most popular home loan has risen to its highest level in more than a year, a widely followed survey shows. But even though the numbers are going up, mortgage rates remain near historic lows — at least for now. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage jumped to 3.22% last week, from 3.11% the previous week, mortgage giant Freddie Mac is reporting. One year ago, the Freddie Mac survey had 30-year fixed-rate loans averaging 2.65%, which is still the all-time low. “Mortgage rates increased during the first week of 2022 to the highest level since May 2020,” says Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. “With higher inflation, promising economic growth and a tight labor market, we expect rates will continue to rise.” Though previous waves of COVID-19 helped keep a lid on rates, that hasn't been happening as the omicron variant spreads wildly throughout the country. But while mortgage rates are higher than they've been in a long time, they're still below where they were in the pre-pandemic days of late 2019 and early 2020. The interest rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 2.43% last week, up from 2.33% the previous week, Freddie Mac says. Last year at this time, 15-year mortgages were averaging 2.16%. Remember that Freddie Mac’s numbers are indeed averages, meaning the rates being offered can be higher — or lower. Some lenders are currently advertising 15-year refi loans at 2% or less. The shorter-term mortgages are popular among refinancing homeowners who are willing to take on a higher monthly payment by going from a 30-year mortgage into a 15-year. In exchange, you pay much less interest over the life of your loan Rates on five-year adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) averaged 2.41% last week, unchanged from a week earlier. One year ago, the loans were averaging 2.75%. ARMs typically start out with lower rates than fixed-rate mortgages. But after a period of time, an ARM starts to adjust — that is, the rate moves up or down in sync with the prime rate or another benchmark. The most popular adjustable-rate loan — the 5/1 ARM — offers five years of fixed interest before adjusting. If you took out one of these variable-rate loans to finance your home purchase, you might want to consider refinancing into a more stable fixed-rate loan now that rates are rising. Last year at this time, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell to its lowest point in history. “Since then, despite the effects of the delta and omicron variants, the job market added more than 6 million jobs, the economy is expanding, and the housing market continues to outperform,” says Nadia Evangelou, senior economist and director of forecasting for the National Association of Realtors. Also, the Federal Reserve is slowing its recent buying binge in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, plus the central bank anticipates it will hike interest rates three times this year. All of those factors are pushing up the interest on Treasury bonds. The bond market, which often portends the direction of mortgage rates, is signaling that home lending rates will continue to climb, Evangelou says. The Realtors' trade group predicts the average 30-year mortgage will be no less than 3.7% by the end of the year. Another industry giant, the Mortgage Bankers Association, expects the 30-year rate will reach 4% toward the end of 2022, with further increases coming next year. If you’re ready to jump into the mortgage pool before it gets too cold, you’ll want to do just a little warmup to make sure you’re getting the best rate. Studies from Freddie Mac and others have found that comparing offers from at least five lenders can maximize your savings on a refi. Shopping around is key, but so is a strong credit history. Review your credit score, which you can easily do for free. If your score is lower than you'd hoped, you may want to work on it before revealing it to picky lenders. If you’ve accumulated high amounts of debt during the pandemic, you might consider rolling those credit balances into a lower-interest debt consolidation loan — to reduce your interest costs and potentially eliminate your debt faster. If a mortgage refi is off the table, there are other ways to lower the cost of homeownership. When it comes time to buy or renew homeowners insurance, a bit of comparison shopping could help you find a lower rate on your coverage.

1/11/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday unveiled a $213 billion general fund budget for the next fiscal year, buttressed by a $45.7 billion surplus as the most populous U.S. state enjoys strong tax revenue in the lopsided recovery from the pandemic.

Lawmakers have to approve it by June 15 or forgo pay. Some of what he proposes uses federal dollars and other sources apart from the general fund. Of the surplus, $20.6 billion can be used for discretionary purposes. Reserves, including constitutionally mandated deposits, total $34.6 billion. The budget would pay down unfunded pension liabilities with additional $3.9 billion in payments to achieve savings. The state would spend a total $20,855 per pupil, a record. Newsom’s spending plans include: $2.7 billion to bolster Covid testing and vaccinations Of that, $1.4 billion is an immediate emergency appropriation $1.2 billion over two years on wildfire mitigation $750 million for drought relief $2 billion for mental health services for homeless people and clearing encampments $2 billion in grants and tax credits to spur more affordable housing $1.6 billion for community colleges $3 billion over two years to pay down unemployment insurance trust fund debt owed to the federal government $6 billion over five years to support zero-emission vehicles and charging infrastructure $356 million over three years, including $132 million next year, in grants to law enforcement to combat retail crime With a progressive tax system that rakes in more revenue when the income of the highest earners rises, California continues to collect more than it forecast. Wealthy residents have reaped the benefits of rising stock prices and stable employment even as lower-income workers lost their jobs during the pandemic. The top 1% of earners pay nearly half of personal income-tax collections. This is the second year of the pandemic that the state’s notching a massive surplus. The current budget spends approximately $210 billion.
