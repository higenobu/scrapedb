12/11/2021,"Britain’s top public health officials have advised ministers that “stringent national measures” need to be imposed by 18 December to avoid Covid hospitalisations surpassing last winter’s peak, according to documents leaked to the Guardian. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, received a presentation from the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) on Tuesday warning that even if the new Omicron variant leads to less serious disease than Delta, it risks overwhelming the NHS with 5,000 people admitted to hospital a day.  In an interview with the Guardian, the epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson said the total could be double that number. No 10 insisted there were no imminent plans to bring in more measures after plan B measures were announced for England this week but cabinet minister Michael Gove, who chaired a Cobra meeting on Friday, said the government had been presented with some “very challenging information” about the speed of the spread. The Guardian has seen leaked advice from UKHSA for Javid marked “official, sensitive” saying: “The key point is that under a range of plausible scenarios, stringent action is need on or before 18 December 2021 if doubling times stay at 2.5 days. Even if doubling times rise to around 5 days, stringent action is likely still needed in December.” It adds: “The rapid spread of Omicron means that action to limit pressures on the health system might have to come earlier than intuition suggests.” Its calculations suggest that even if Omicron causes a less severe hospitalisation rate of 1% or 0.5% compared with Delta’s 1.5%, then “stringent national measures’” would be needed by 18 December at the latest. The document stresses that the figures are not a projection but an estimate of Omicron prevalence and doubling times seen in the UK so far. The document does not detail what the necessary curbs would be but defines “stringent national measures” as those that bring the R (reproduction) number below 1. Boris Johnson triggered plan B this week including more wide-ranging mask mandates, asking people to work from home and Covid passports for big venues but a senior Whitehall source said few inside UKHSA believe this will have much effect on slowing the spread of the variant. Further measures, now being referred to as plan C, could include stricter isolation requirements for contacts of Covid cases, masks in pubs, shutting hospitality entirely, more restrictions on visitors to care homes and hospitals or even a return on curbs on social contact. As the ministers convened a Cobra to discuss Omicron, the level of concern about the variant is rising among its scientific and public health advisers. There were more than 58,000 new confirmed UK daily cases of Covid on Friday – the highest level since January – with 120 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Cobra involving the four nations of the UK was chaired by Gove, the levelling up secretary, as Johnson spent time with his family after the birth of his second child with his wife, Carrie Johnson. He warned that evidence suggests Omicron is “more likely” than past Covid-19 variants to “potentially” lead to hospital admissions among the fully vaccinated. Sturgeon warned of a “potential tsunami” of Omicron infections as the new variant brings “the fastest exponential growth we have seen in this pandemic so far”. At an unscheduled televised Covid update on Friday, the first minister said that “frankness” with the public was necessary, as the Scottish government published an evidence paper suggesting Omicron is “rising exponentially”. It came as the Welsh government hinted at new restrictions on visiting people in care homes and hospitals to counter the impact of Omicron. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, also suggested it would be wise for businesses and public sector leaders to plan for the possibility of further clamp-downs and even a new lockdown. He said: “We will be issuing new guidance for visiting in care homes and hospitals. We want to do all we can to support visiting where it is safe to do so but, if we see a new wave of cases, some strengthened measures to protect patients and residents may be needed.”",News/World news,"‘Stringent’ UK Covid measures needed within a week, leak reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/stringent-uk-covid-measures-needed-within-a-week-leak-reveals
12/11/2021,"The imperious Magnus Carlsen confirmed his long-held place as the best chess player on the planet on Friday by retaining the world championship with a fourth win over Ian Nepomniachtchi in the 11th encounter of their showdown in Dubai. A tightly wound contest that appeared bound for a draw immediately came undone when the Russian challenger made a ghastly blunder that gifted Carlsen the game and match, punctuating a dramatic breakdown that started a week ago when Nepomniachtchi came up short in the sixth game, a psychologically taxing 7hr 45min epic.  Carlsen’s winning score of 7½-3½ with three games to spare is the most lopsided result in a world championship match since José Raúl Capablanca’s triumph over Emanuel Lasker exactly 100 years ago in Havana. In that match, Capablanca won by a four-game margin without a single defeat – a stunning margin Carlsen matched on Friday with a fourth decisive result in six games after their first five meetings ended in draws. “It’s hard to feel that great joy when the situation was so comfortable to begin with, but I’m happy with a very good performance overall,” said Carlsen. “You can point to things you could have done differently in every game of course, but overall I’m happy with my play, very proud of my effort in the sixth game, and that sort of laid the foundation for everything.” Nepomniachtchi, playing with the favourable white pieces, bypassed the English Opening he’d played in Tuesday’s ninth game for an Italian (1 ... e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bc4). The players blitzed out their opening moves (3 ... Nf6 4 d3 Bc5 5 c3 d6 6 O-O a5 7 Re1 Ba7 8 Na3) until Carlsen played the rare 8 .... h6, a line only seen twice previously at the highest level. The challenger spent nearly 18 minutes pondering his response, seemingly taken out of his opening preparation, before playing 9 Nc2. Tension continued to build from there, reaching a flashpoint with the four pawns staring at each other in the center of the board after Nepomniachtchi’s 19 .... d4 and Carlsen’s 20 d5, although the chess supercomputers evaluating the match pointed towards a peaceful result. But not long after, Nepomniachtchi made another sensational blunder – his third on a pawn move in the past week – attacking black’s rook with 23 g3. Carlsen found the winning response within a minute and a half (23 ... dxe3) and from there the game and match was all but a handshake away. When the Russian finally resigned after 49 moves and 3hr 21min, the Norwegian’s fifth win in five world championship matches was done and dusted. “I didn’t expect it go quite like this,” said Carlsen, who brings home a 60% share of the €2m (£1.7m) purse for winning before the tiebreak stage. “I think it was just a very good professional performance overall. No regrets at all, just very satisfied.” He added: “After five games there were five draws and I’d had very, very few chances to play for anything more. Then everything kind of clicked and after that it all went my way. You don’t expect to necessarily run away with it in a world championship.” Of his fatal blunders in the eighth, ninth and 11th games, a rueful Nepomniachtchi said: “These things which happened here, they have never happened to me at basically any events … In my career I lost quite some stupid games but not as many in such a [short] time.”",Sport/Sport,Magnus Carlsen retains world chess title after final Ian Nepomniachtchi blunder,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/10/magnus-carlsen-retains-world-chess-championship-title-after-final-ian-nepomniachtchi-blunder
12/11/2021,"The US supreme court has ruled that Texas abortion providers can sue over the state’s ban on most abortions, but the justices are allowing the law to remain in effect, much to the dismay of pro-choice advocates and abortion providers. The so-called “Heartbeat Act”, which was signed into law by Greg Abbott, the state’s Republican governor, and went into effect in September, bans abortions at six weeks and does not make exceptions for incest and rape.  Furthermore, it empowers private citizens to enforce the law, rather than the authorities, giving them the right to sue any abortion provider whom they believe has violated the law or anyone aiding the provision of the service, although not the patient receiving the abortion service. The law provides for a $10,000 penalty against defendants found to have violated the law. Reproductive health advocates and Democrats have sharply criticized the supreme court’s ruling, arguing that the court did not do enough to abolish a law that many say nullifies a constitutionally protected right. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, alongside the court’s other two liberal-leaning members, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan, wrote that they disagreed with the conservative majority’s refusal to stop the law, known as SB8, completely. “The court should have put an end to this madness months ago, before SB8 first went into effect. It failed to do so then, and it fails again today … I dissent … from the court’s dangerous departure from its precedents … The court thus betrays not only the citizens of Texas, but also our constitutional system of government,” wrote Sotomayor. She added: “The dispute is over whether states may nullify federal constitutional rights by employing schemes like the one at hand.” Democratic senator Cory Booker of New Jersey called the ruling wrong, saying: “This half measure from the supreme court is wrong. It continues to deny Texans their constitutional right to an abortion and is causing harm at this very moment.” Massachusetts Democratic senator and former presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren said the Friday decision in the Texas case was outrageous. “While SCOTUS has allowed challenges to SB8 to proceed, it’s outrageous that the Court has again decided not to block Texas’ unconstitutional abortion ban,” tweeted Warren. “More Texans are harmed every day this law is allowed to stand. The Senate must pass the Women’s Health Protection Act.” That law would codify the right to abortion access in the US into national legislation. The bill passed the House in September and is in limbo in the US Senate. Laurence Tribe, co-founder of the American Constitution Society and constitutional law scholar at Harvard University, also condemned the ruling. “Letting abortion clinics sue to challenge SB8 but leaving that outrageous six-week abortion ban remain in place – just as it was clear this radically rightwing court would do – reaffirms my view that this court needs major reform and needs it now,” he wrote, and called the court with its new conservative supermajority “broken”. Others criticized what they saw as the conservatives’ religious motive, influenced by Republicans, AKA the GOP. Dean Obeidallah, an American lawyer and host of a SiriusXM show, wrote: “The GOP Supreme Court allows religious supremacy to continue by not halting the Texas GOP abortion law. That law is about imposing the GOP’s extreme religious beliefs upon the rest of us. The Taliban should sue the GOP for trademark infringement.” Some praised the ruling, including Dan Patrick, the Republican lieutenant governor of Texas. “Texas is a solidly pro-life state, and I will never stop fighting to protect innocent life from the radical abortionist left. A great victory for the unborn!” he tweeted. Similarly, the Susan B Anthony List, a nonprofit anti-abortion organization, welcomed the ruling, writing, “This is good news because the law will remain in effect, already saving thousands of lives, and we hope more to come.”",News/Law,‘The court should have put an end to this madness’: reproductive health advocates criticize abortion ruling,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/dec/10/us-supreme-court-abortion-texas-law-critics
12/11/2021,"Elected to parliament in 2010 after a career in engineering and banking, Andrew Griffiths spent eight years as Conservative MP for Burton in Staffordshire before his career imploded in a sexting scandal. He was a junior minister in July 2018 when the Sunday Mirror reported he had bombarded two constituents with explicit messages. He sent them more than 2,000 texts, often referring to himself as Daddy. He boasted he was busy “running the country” but wanted to be “licking naughty girls” and offered them hundreds of pounds for sex.  Griffiths was married then, with a child, and presented himself as a champion of women. He helped to found Women2Win, the organisation dedicated to electing more female Conservative MPs, and campaigned for upskirting to be outlawed. But in his private life he behaved quite differently, messaging the women to say: “I want to be able to lift your skirts over dinner and show my friends.” He quit as small business minister almost immediately, a post he had held for just seven months, saying he was was “deeply shamed” and would be seeking help. But he said he would fight for his career and reputation. He apologised for embarrassing Theresa May, then prime minister. He was close to May, having been her chief of staff when she was in the shadow cabinet in 2004, and used to have a picture of the two of them as his Twitter avatar. Days later the Guardian revealed Griffiths was already under investigation for allegations of inappropriate touching and bullying. A few months on, he gave an interview to the Sunday Times in which he said the sexting occurred when he was having a manic episode linked to being sexually abused as a child. He also talked of thinking of killing himself, stopping only when thinking of the effect on his wife and daughter and when the chief whip contacted parliament’s doctor and got him into hospital. His wife, Kate Griffiths (nee Kniveton), left him almost immediately, refusing to pose for photographs to the press to suggest she was standing by him. It was the third time he had betrayed her since they got together in 2008, she told the family court. He’d had a long affair with someone while he lived in London, which Kate only discovered when the other woman appeared at Conservative party conference. He was also caught sexting a different woman in 2011, the court heard. Despite resigning as a minister, he remained an MP until the snap general election in 2019. He stood for re-election but so did Kate, who ultimately won the selection battle and retained the seat with a majority of 14,496. An employee at Burton Albion football club, she was a surprising candidate, with no background in politics. She had led a sheltered life before meeting Griffiths in 2006, living with her parents until her late 30s when they got together. Their relationship began as an affair conducted in hotel rooms – he was living with someone else at the time. After her election to the Commons, she pledged to be an advocate for domestic abuse survivors but kept her own abuse private. That all changed on Friday when an appeal court judge ruled that a “fact finding judgment” into the couple’s relationship could be made public. Kate gave her blessing for the document to be made public, which included harrowing evidence of rape and coercion she had given to Derby family court when Griffiths applied to spend time with his child. “I supported publication of the Family Court’s findings – and waived my right to anonymity – because I recognise the unique position I am in to campaign to improve the outcomes of cases such as this, for those who endure domestic violence, and the actions taken to protect the children involved,” she said on Friday. In her maiden speech, she described her constituents as hard-working, resilient people. “Throughout our history, we have suffered and overcome adversity,” she said. She could have been speaking about herself.",News/Politics,Court ruling lays bare violent behaviour of ex-Tory MP Andrew Griffiths,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/10/court-ruling-lays-bare-violent-behaviour-of-ex-tory-mp-andrew-griffiths
12/11/2021,"Parkrun Australia will return nationwide for the first time in months next weekend when vaccine mandates in New South Wales are lifted. NSW is the last state to restart the free weekly 5km runs, having been suspended since 19 June, after vaccine mandates in Victoria were clarified last month.  Parkrun cancelled its Victorian schedule indefinitely at the start of November after the event was listed under “physical recreation” and required all participants to be fully vaccinated. But Victorian health authorities eventually gave it the green light to resume on 27 November with its existing Covid framework in place. Parkrun’s health and wellbeing lead, Glen Turner, said the resumption in both states that have been subject to long lockdowns this year was a huge boost to people who depended on parkrun for social interaction and physical activity. “There was a nice cheer that went up in the office when we found out we were coming back that weekend … people in New South Wales and Victoria have been affected by Covid restrictions enormously,” he said. “As of 18 December, it’ll be the first time since early this year all our parkruns have reopened and are operating as normal … it’s absolutely terrific.” Megan Paton has attended the Kamay parkrun in Sydney for nine years “on and off”. “I can’t wait,” she said of its long-anticipated return. “My family are so happy for it to come back so I can go. I’m very excited … there’s so many looking forward to it – just being able to see each other again. “There’s people I would never have met but through parkrun we talk and chat, check in on how they’re going.” ” Paton made herself go for runs during lockdown but said it “wasn’t the same”. “It’s just not like being there with everyone and running a proper course…not just around my suburb,” she said. More than 700,000 people, and 120,000 volunteers, have taken part in the weekly Saturday events in Australia. Some 90,000 were identified as “physically inactive” when they registered for parkrun, which began with 13 runners in London in 2004 and has since bloomed into a global phenomenon. Turner said people had felt “less motivated” to be physically active during lockdowns while they were disconnected from their communities. “Parkrun provides what people have been missing most,” he said. “It’s not about the run but that focal point with the community, to come every week and have support. It’s a one-hour escape from reality.” An internal parkrun survey in October found 71% of respondents were motivated to take part in parkrun to feel part of a community, and 31% to feel less isolated. More than half said their mental health had suffered as a result of the pandemic. Turner said the reopened runs in Victoria, which had been streamlined with more physically distanced volunteer roles, had been attended by many people who just came along to cheer others. Under the Covid-safe plan in Victoria, volunteers must be fully vaccinated and record their vaccinations status but they do not need to check the status of runners. QR codes are provided at entrances. “With 430 events around the country, we needed to make sure we worked closely as possible with landowners and public health to make sure all events are compliant and take place every week,” Turner said. Some 6,000 walkers and runners took part in the first week back, alongside 900 volunteers. “It’s been overwhelming,” he said. “A lot of people have been in tears. It’s been quite an emotional time for the 100 communities in Melbourne without parkrun for all of 2020. “So many people use the term ‘parkrun family’ they haven’t seen for a long time, so getting back and having something resembling normality was a real sigh of relief.” Turner said it wasn’t uncommon for health professionals to prescribe fun runs to patients struggling with mental health. “Now we’re back, we’ve had an influx of health professionals across the board looking to have discussions with patients about how parkrun can help with current treatment plans,” he said. “Parkrun isn’t about running, it’s about so many more things that benefit health and wellbeing in a fundamental way.”",News/Australia news,Emotions run high as parkrun Australia prepares to restarts nationwide,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/11/emotions-run-high-as-parkrun-australia-prepares-to-restart-nationwide
12/11/2021,"One reason Jeffrey Smart paintings have gone up in price is because that’s what happens when there’s a big show, such as the one at the National Gallery of Australia celebrating 100 years since the late artist’s birth. Another reason is love. Specifically, how the love for Smart’s paintings stays unrequited because it’s never wholly fulfilled. “I’ve really noticed with this show that private collectors hold on very closely, it’s been a bit of a wrench,” says the exhibition’s co-curator Deborah Hart. “A lot of people really love them and maybe that’s got to do with their open-endedness. I imagine if you lived with [a Smart painting] you’d keep seeing things a little bit differently in the work.” Or, as the exhibition’s second curator, Rebecca Edwards, writes in her catalogue essay: “Smart’s work is an inscrutable and open-ended riddle.”  Titled Jeffrey Smart, the NGA exhibition is not a retrospective so “we don’t have that obligation and pressure to include every large important work”, Hart says. Yet many are among the 125 works anyway, including Smart’s very funny Portrait of Clive James, in which James is placed on a far-off highway overpass, comically dwarfed by a corrugated iron fence. Looking at it, you wonder if Smart’s wry idea of what constituted a portrait might have influenced bolder departures from tradition later, such as Justine Varga’s controversial 2017 Olive Cotton award-winning photographic portrait of her grandmother, made from scribble and spit. His Cahill Expressway from 1962 is here too, its stout male businessman standing alone in a Sydney gripped by an unnerving stasis and emptiness that, until 2020, seemed a wholly surreal scene. Not any more. Smart was born in Adelaide in 1921. The exhibition explores the arc of his 70-year practice, concluding with his last work Labyrinth, painted from his wheelchair when he was 89 years old. While the curation does not serve up the comfort food of a strict chronology, there is a smooth flow between “the ideas and motifs that really interested him”, says Edwards. Preliminary studies and sketches reveal his meticulous preparations, and the trajectory of his life is shown – from Adelaide to Sydney to Italy, where he lived for 45 years until his death in 2013. “You’re not going to leave wondering, ‘Who was Jeffrey Smart? What did he do?’” Hart says. “We didn’t want to go too wild.” Good plan. Life’s wild enough right now. The “heightened stillness” of Smart’s urban visions, as Hart describes it, is plenty to absorb. In any case, Smart liked his paintings being left to speak for themselves. “Jeffrey Smart made it a principle to not explain his art verbally, much to the chagrin of art critics, journalists and documentary makers,” writes the Smart estate archivist, Stephen Rogers, in the catalogue. “Any direct question as to the meaning of a work was pushed aside.” His audience was thus able to “create their own story”. Five sound artists have done just that, producing two compositions each in response to 10 paintings, commissioned through the experimental Melbourne-based sound organisation Liquid Architecture. “The lovely thing is it makes you slow down, because you want to listen to the music and look at the work at the same time,” Hart says. Edwards says the process of looking and listening made her “notice things I’d never noticed before”. Smart loved opera and Bach but most of all Wagner; he travelled with his partner, Ermes De Zan, for performances of the Ring Cycle in cities around the world. When a documentarian once suggested the “evident stillness” of his work should be “echoed by a complementary silence”, Smart disagreed. “What I’d love to have is a background … [Wagner’s] Parsifal would be beautiful.” The contemporary compositions “are not what Jeffrey might have personally chosen”, Hart says. He may have been “quite shocked”, says Edwards. Or maybe not. Smart’s study of art, love of philosophy and cinema, and reading of profound texts continued even as he aged, indicating openness and humility. His works often reference art movements such as abstract expressionism and pop art, and he replicated both The Dance (Matisse) and Mona Lisa (Da Vinci) as posters in paintings. His 1972 work The Painted Factory is a nod to René Magritte with its figure holding up a painting within a painting – and, depending on your eyesight, another painting within that. Sound art about art about art may well have delighted him. The only cubist work he produced is exhibited too, alongside a similar work by his Adelaide teacher, Dorrit Black. In the early 1940s Black taught Smart the principles of the golden mean and dynamic symmetry and, while a lot is heard about the impact of poet TS Eliot on Smart’s thinking, Black was a seminal influence too. “He really admired women artists – Dorrit Black, Jacqueline Hick, Jean Bellette, you could go on,” Hart says. “People now associate him with being such a successful artist but in the 40s and 50s he was really struggling … living in boarding houses and trying to make ends meet. Women meant a lot to him in his life and people who supported him like [artist] Judy Cassab when he was really struggling in Sydney, ​​​​he very much acknowledges their support and his admiration, especially for Dorritt.” Jeffrey Smart is showing at the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra from 11 December to 15 May",Arts/Art and design,‘An inscrutable and open-ended riddle’: the life and art of Jeffrey Smart,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/11/an-inscrutable-and-open-ended-riddle-the-life-and-art-of-jeffrey-smart
12/11/2021,"Two of the government’s biggest departments were found to have broken freedom of information law within a month of each other, prompting the watchdog to demand urgent explanations and reforms from both, documents show. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) last month found the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade breached the law by dragging out and eventually refusing a request by lawyer and FoI specialist Peter Timmins, documents seen by Guardian Australia show.  Timmins had asked for a single, clearly-identified document – an audit of Australia’s engagement with multilateral bodies such as the World Health Organisation – but the department repeatedly missed legally-imposed deadlines, complaining that the request was complex and asking for more time. Eventually, the department decided the document was, in fact, a cabinet document, causing it to refuse Timmins’ request. Timmins complained to the OAIC about what he alleged were a litany of basic errors in the department’s handling of the request. The watchdog told the department that, as well as breaching the law in the Timmins case, its general compliance with FoI rules had “diminished” in recent years. It met legally-imposed deadlines in just 68.4% of requests in 2020-21, a significant drop from 86% the year before. The OAIC demanded “an explanation and assessment of the reasons for noncompliance … and proposals to improve compliance”. It also told the department to appoint an information champion to “provide leadership, oversight and accountability necessary to promote and operationalise the department’s compliance with the FoI Act”. The scathing assessment came within a month of a similar finding against another major department, the prime minister’s department, which was found to have broken the law in its response to an FoI request about its handling of the alleged rape of Brittany Higgins in Parliament House, Canberra. That case also prompted the OAIC to recommend the department audit itself and report back on its “compliance with statutory timeframes”. It was also told to appoint an information champion to help it meet FoI law. Timmins said it was “telling” that nearly 40 years after Australia embraced the right-to-know principle, departments like the foreign affairs and trade department were being told by the regulator to appoint senior figures to improve FoI compliance. “We’ve never invested in or fully embraced the concept of open government,” he said. “The tone at the top set by the Morrison government is antithetical to the object of the FoI Act to promote Australia’s representative democracy by increasing public participation in government processes and promoting the scrutiny, discussion, comment and review of the government’s activities.” The Guardian approached the department but did not receive a response by deadline. In its response to the OAIC, the department accepted it “fell short in its compliance with statutory FoI timeframes in relation to Mr Timmins’ FoI requests”. “This is largely a result of substantial increases in recent years in the number and complexity of FoI requests received by the department,” it said. “The department takes seriously its FoI obligations and has taken steps to improve its FoI compliance.” It also told the OAIC it accepted its recommendations. The department earlier said the request was difficult because it was “connected to complex foreign policy issues concerning Australia’s engagement in international organisations”. “The department, therefore, in processing the requests, adopted a careful approach to consultation and deliberation to mitigate the risk to Australia’s international relations and national interest.”",News/Australia news,Information watchdog demands change after two government departments break FoI laws within a month,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/11/information-watchdog-demands-change-after-two-government-departments-break-foi-laws-within-a-month
12/11/2021,"People close to Gladys Berejiklian say the former New South Wales premier was never going to run in the federal seat of Warringah – this was always a fever dream of Scotty from Marketing. Berejiklian’s relationship with Scott Morrison is said to be terrible. “She owes him nothing,” one senior Liberal told me this week. For a story about nothing, this one has been grimly fascinating. Berejiklian may have always been a non-starter, but some Liberals in Canberra certainly wanted the former premier to be a good soldier for the Liberal party. Guardian Australia’s Sarah Martin broke that story back in October.  The overwrought conscription exercise tells us federal Liberals are chasing every single seat. Both sides of politics think next year’s election could be close enough to deliver a hung parliament. The Liberals want Warringah back, but to have a realistic prospect of blasting out the independent Zali Steggall, any Liberal candidate would need to have a high profile and good name recognition. A former premier obviously meets that criteria. But dead-weighting the high profile and good name recognition was Berejiklian’s troubles. The former premier resigned in September after the Independent Commission Against Corruption revealed it was investigating whether she broke the law by failing to report a reasonable suspicion of corruption on the part of her ex-lover, the former Wagga Wagga MP Daryl Maguire. Berejiklian subsequently faced a grilling at the Icac in November. She has consistently denied any wrongdoing. In the normal course of events, a prime minister would not be trying to conscript a former premier tangled up in an Icac process. At a practical level, this would be considered politically risky; perhaps entirely bonkers. Some prime ministers might even harbour principled objections. By this I mean there is a process under way in NSW – an institutional accountability process that helps lend legitimacy to public life. Best to not show up with some madcap recruitment scheme, bellowing wild theories from the sidelines. But not Morrison. Busy, busy, busy. He got to work minimising the seriousness of Berejiklian’s situation. “The Australian people know that the former premier of NSW was done over by a bad process and an abuse of process,” the prime minister contended in the parliament during the final chaotic sitting fortnight. Morrison raved about the perils of “kangaroo court[s]” spying on people’s boyfriends when they “should be looking at criminal conduct”. He contended the NSW Icac was in the public humiliation business – “chasing down people’s love lives”. Now obviously there are legitimate policy arguments to be had about the design and remit of anti-corruption bodies. Those debates can be conducted appropriately and thoughtfully in sober and proportionate fashion. But the prime minister poleaxed sober and proportionate and thoughtful, because Morrison was hell-bent on rebranding the state’s anti-corruption body as a publicly funded voyeur. Gossip Girl Got Gladys was his pitch. This was disgraceful behaviour. Seriously, there is no other word for it. Morrison, the most powerful politician in the country, launched a full-frontal assault on a body charged with keeping corruption out of politics – rhetorical shots fired, in broad daylight, in plain sight. Australia’s prime minister was, as the former NSW supreme court judge Anthony Whealy put it later, very obviously trashing the principles of integrity and accountability “in the most terrible fashion”. Apparently impervious to criticism, Morrison kept going. As time passed, the story grew more elaborate. At the start of this week, the prime minister told reporters: “Gladys was put in a position of actually having to stand down and there was no findings of anything.” Fact: Berejiklan resigned as premier in September, voluntarily. Fact: she told reporters on the day she quit that an alternative scenario – one where she stood aside while Icac conducted its investigation – was “not an option”. Fact: any findings associated with the current investigation are pending, not absent. As well as trying to smooth the path for a reluctant Berejiklian in Warringah, we also need to be crystal clear that stoking a public backlash about the evils of prurient anti-corruption bodies also served the prime minister’s own immediate political needs. Morrison was ending the year under pressure because of his failure to legislate the federal integrity commission he promised three years ago. During his fraught final parliamentary sitting fortnight, in between clubbing the NSW Icac (nosy buggers, who needs them?) Morrison pretended it was Labor’s fault there was no federal integrity commission. He said he couldn’t bring his proposed model to parliament because Labor wouldn’t vote for it, because Labor wanted the nasty Icac in NSW that spied on people’s boyfriends, and nobody wanted that. You can see how the zeitgeist loop the prime minister was feeding (busy busy busy) was potentially useful to him at a few different levels. It’s important to understand that when Morrison enters the brutal zone of pure politics – whatever it takes, never mind the corrosion, never mind the cost – he often relies on information asymmetry. He understands that time-poor swinging voters don’t really engage with how parliament and the legislative process works. More than that, the prime minister actively encourages these voters not to gain the fluency necessary to decode his or anyone else’s intra-day political machinations. He tells them everything that happens in Canberra is irrelevant. It’s all bubble stuff. Don’t waste your energy trying to understand any of it. So it is possible that time-poor voters could hear Morrison declare that Labor was the reason they had no integrity commission after three years – and believe it, despite that being nonsense. To be clear, in the world of facts, the opposition wasn’t Morrison’s problem. The prime minister stalled on his integrity commission proposal for two reasons. The first is the government has significant reservations about going there at all. This deep reluctance is now profoundly evident. The second is Morrison is worried about his own people crossing the floor. Some Liberals have made it clear they think the government’s current proposal is too weak. Efforts by the attorney general to beef up the government’s proposal met resistance in cabinet. The government was bogged in an uneasy internal stalemate as the parliamentary year ended. I said earlier Morrison’s conduct has been disgraceful. It’s also been insidious. Insidious is a powerful word that should only ever be invoked proportionately, but the charge is warranted on this occasion. Morrison went to war with an institution important to safeguarding trust in democracies in order to serve his immediate political interests. This behaviour can’t be shrugged off. It needs to be called out, and forcefully. It is insidious. Gladys for Warringah isn’t just a mildly amusing example of Morrison hatching a cunning plan that ultimately goes to custard. Australia’s prime minister has, for the past few weeks, been publicly at war with a state anti-corruption commission, while at the same time trying to inoculate himself against entirely justifiable criticism that he’s failed to produce a credible body to watch politicians at the federal level despite promising one for three years. Just let those basic facts settle on you for a few minutes, really think about what’s just happened. Process this case study, in all its dimensions. You’ll get to insidious pretty quickly.",News/Australia news,Gladys for Warringah is the latest salvo in Morrison’s war against an integrity commission | Katherine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/11/gladys-for-warringah-is-the-latest-salvo-in-morrisons-war-against-an-integrity-commission
12/11/2021,"Scott Morrison is fond of telling the Coalition party room that disunity is death in politics, and that all MPs need to help “make the boat go faster”. But as the 46th parliament winds down before the 2022 election and Australia reopens from coronavirus restrictions, the government faces a growing revolt from its own members about its handling of the pandemic.  This week senator Gerard Rennick campaigned against the approval of the Pfizer vaccine for children, senator Alex Antic appeared on former Trump advisor Steve Bannon’s War Room: Pandemic, and Nationals MP George Christensen spoke with American conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, encouraging people to protest outside Australian embassies against what he portrayed as a loss of freedom. Speaking from hotel quarantine in South Australia, Antic accused state governments of a “drift into authoritarianism”, arguing that an “unelected health bureaucracy” had sent him to what was essentially a “detention facility”. “We need to drain the billabong in this country,” he said, mimicking Donald Trump’s election slogan. “It’s as simple as that.” Christensen laughed as Jones compared Australia’s Covid-19 quarantine facilities to Auschwitz because they both had “big fences”. “The rest of the free world, please stand with us, please support us, and every time we see people out there protesting, whether it be in front of an embassy or elsewhere, protesting for our rights in Australia, it really does embolden the patriots, the people who are for freedom in our country to stand up,” Christensen said. Rennick gained more than 70,000 Facebook followers in a month as he posted about reports of adverse events from vaccination, which he admitted he could not be sure were “100% accurate”. Both he and Antic have refused to vote for government legislation, and in the final sitting fortnight of parliament three others joined them to cross the floor and vote with One Nation against vaccine mandates. Experts say it appears fringe elements within the government are appealing to the radical right to shore up support against challenges from minor parties, including the United Australia party and One Nation. Dr Josh Roose, a senior research fellow of politics and religion at Deakin University, says “fringe messaging and blatant populism” is designed to address “a serious concern in the Liberal party that many of their constituents are drawn to the UAP”. “They’re quite clearly attempting to appeal to voters who might be lost to them, through their forms of independent or faux media.” With the non-major party vote at an all time high, minor parties like the UAP are within reach of Senate seats in states including New South Wales and Western Australia. Their preferences could also influence the outcome in marginal lower house seats. In Queensland, the assistant attorney general, Amanda Stoker, and the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, are both up for re-election, duelling for one or two Senate seats against the UAP and former Liberal state premier Campbell Newman, now lead candidate for the Liberal Democrats, who are also anti-lockdown. But Roose says there is also a genuine convergence of views, and elements of the Liberal and National parties are “highly influenced by fringe movements”, particularly in America. “The alt-right characters seeking to build momentum here stand fundamentally opposed to liberalism, pluralism, constitutionalism,” he says. Roose warns the radical right is “drawing direct inspiration” from the US, seeking to “replicate tactics, to polarise, to divide, to exploit people feeling a bit angry and alienated after two years of lockdown”. Lise Waldek, a lecturer in terrorism studies at Macquarie University, says when politicians from mainstream parties appear in “counter-media”, such as shows presented by Bannon or Jones, it provides “an opportunity for extremists … to mainstream their beliefs”. It “gives credence to an infrastructure directly in opposition to things we value in liberal democracy,” she says. Dr Julian Droogan, an associate professor of terrorism studies at Macquarie University, says there has been “strong growth in conspiratorial sentiment in far right spaces online” which has “leaked out beyond the far right to the broader public”. “There is a clear risk involved in politicians of any sort attempting to … align themselves with these movements, because they are inherently conspiratorial and anti-establishment.” Chris Cooper, the executive director of Reset Australia, which raises awareness of digital threats to Australian democracy, says the rise of fringe influencers has been “fuelled by social media algorithms in the first place”. “[They’ve] pushed them into echo chambers where the most sensational, outrageous and conspiratorial content is amplified because it’s the most engaging and that’s the business model to keep us online.” Cooper says politicians such as Christensen and MP Craig Kelly, who was banned from Facebook due to Covid-19 misinformation and left the Liberals for the UAP, have capitalised on that. Even posting content that rates well in the US helps boost their audience in Australia among those with similar views on vaccines, lockdowns or climate change. Cooper says Rennick appears to be appealing to members of the public who are misinformed or fearful of vaccines and “trying to leverage that for his own influence”. “He’s leaning into fear and outrage, which is what the algorithms are built to do and prioritise. It is grossly irresponsible from an elected representative. “But it’s hard to see that it’s really anything more than him trying to seek some relevance with an audience looking for voices in parliament to legitimise their misinformed views.” Rennick has denied he was sharing the posts to increase his public profile, saying he was “moved” by people’s stories and was “shocked about the mistreatment” of those who had experienced what they perceived as adverse events linked to the vaccine. When controversies involve his own MPs, Morrison’s first instinct is often to defend them on free speech grounds – which he did when Labor criticised those attending the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2019 and again in July when Christensen attended anti-lockdown rallies in Queensland. The Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, has previously said he won’t demand Christensen desist from contradicting public health advice because the Coalition governs with a “thin margin” and if you “start prodding the bear, you’re going to make the situation worse”. This latest crop of controversies has drawn some condemnation from the top of the government, but failed to silence the rogue MPs. The acting Nationals leader, David Littleproud, counselled and condemned Christensen over his comments, warning the appearance was an “error of judgement” and “there are limits and there are boundaries” that must be observed. Christensen later wrote on his Telegram channel that the criticism had been “fake news”, “political elitist handwringing” and “hyperventilation”. At a press conference about the harms of social media on Wednesday, Morrison said he thought Jones’s comments comparing quarantine to a concentration camp were “appalling”. “I have spoken to George directly about them,” he told reporters in Sydney. “I think they’re absolutely appalling. George is not a candidate for the LNP at the next election and I think George should quietly go into retirement.” A spokesman for Morrison tells Guardian Australia the government “will continue to listen to the medical experts on these issues and strongly suggests Senator Rennick does the same”. Rennick says he does not intend to stop social media advocacy on adverse events and rejects the label of misinformation, despite officials assuring him the Pfizer vaccine is safe for children. “These are people’s stories and [the charge of misinformation is] an insult to those people,” he says. “It’s medical gaslighting of people who are having trouble getting their adverse events recognised.” When questioned about Antic and Christensen, Morrison also implicitly argued that traditional media should ignore them rather than try to hold him accountable for government members. “Well, I don’t think it’s a good idea to promote what they’re saying by constantly drawing it to people’s attention,” he said. “I’m not seeking to do that. I don’t agree with them.” Roose says the federal Coalition is “running scared” of losing the balance of power to minor parties, warning that anything less than “complete condemnation” could be viewed as “tacit support” for radical views. “A light has to be cast on this sort of behaviour. If it’s allowed to fester … it will grow worse, and it will disease the entire body politic … it has to be stamped out.” Droogan says it was heartening in the case of Christensen that “the message has been to disavow, call out and reject it”. “If going on these sorts of conspiratorial media shows and counter-media is not called out, then effectively what could happen is shifting of that Overton window of what is considered possible and normal.” Cooper says: “Any leader of any government has to take responsibility for the irresponsible misinformation of any of their members; the same is true of the opposition or any party.” Misinformation is “rife” in sections of social media. “By there being no accountability measures, no calling it out … it leaves that misinformation to thrive within echo chambers and communities which are only going to be more entrenched and ill-informed.”",News/Australia news,"Conspiracy, Covid and the Coalition: why are more of its MPs appealing to the alt-right?",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/11/conspiracy-covid-and-the-coalition-why-are-more-of-its-mps-appealing-to-the-alt-right
12/11/2021,"It’s not just the gossip-hungry who have been devouring every bit of news about marriage bust-ups among Sydney’s fund manager set – or, at least, it shouldn’t be. For while many may be reading the details of the dissolution of the marital bonds between fund manager Charlie Aitken and his wife, Ellie, with an eye to the details (Charlie has hooked up with his business partner’s wife, Hollie Nasser, who was Ellie’s best friend) investors who have put their money with Aitken Investment Management have a financial interest, not just a prurient one, in the unfolding drama.  For the same reason, investors in Magellan Financial Group and the funds it manages should also be paying attention to the much less high-profile separation between the group’s billionaire co-founder and chief investment officer, Hamish Douglass, and his wife, Alexandra. This is because fund manager divorce can be a wealth hazard not only for the executive in question, but for the investors who trust them to earn their keep by outperforming the market, at least according to one 2016 study published in the Journal of Financial Economics. In a the six-month period surrounding the divorce of a hedge fund manager, returns to investors were 4.33% a year less than before the breakup, it found. The study, Limited Attention, Marital Events and Hedge Funds, by academics from Florida and Singapore, suggests that investment professionals who usually spend their days monitoring the flow of news coming from markets like the ASX might be better off refreshing the Daily Mail’s sidebar of shame, which has covered the Aitken family’s demerger in excruciating detail. “The deleterious effects of a divorce extend beyond the six-month event window,” the academics said in their paper. “Hedge funds continue to underperform by a risk-adjusted 2.29% per annum up to two years post divorce.” So far, Aitken’s fund, the AIM Global High Conviction Fund, has yet to show any signs of damage from its founder’s separation. Performance has not been stellar, but nor has it fallen off a cliff. As of its most recent update, last month, the fund was returning 26.4% a year to its investors – just shy of the 26.6% benchmark Aitken has set for it. It remains to be seen whether the continuous coverage of his formerly private life in the pages of the Mail and the Daily Telegraph since late November, when news broke that his 20-year marriage was over, will start to eat into returns. Among developments lovingly documented by the tabloid media since the bust-up, Ellie Aitken and Nasser, who is the wife of his investment partner Chris Nasser, have been duelling via Instagram and there has been an alleged verbal confrontation – captured by photographers – between Aitken and his estranged wife outside the Aitken marital home in Sydney’s eastern suburbs In a direct financial hit to Aitken’s empire, Chris Nasser is also reported to have liquidated $7.5m he had with the group – a big chunk of change given its flagship fund had assets under management of just $93m as of February, according to Morningstar data. Over at the much bigger Magellan, which looks after more than $116bn worth of assets, events are proceeding in a slightly more dignified fashion. In a statement issued to the stock exchange on Wednesday, the Douglasses said that they “separated some months ago”. “As our family and friends appreciate, we both remain extremely close and united,” the no-longer-a-pair said. “We continue to spend considerable time together, and as a family.” They said media speculation that they planned to sell some of their shares in Magellan was “unfounded” and they had no intention of offloading any of them. Magellan has been a poor investment this year; shares in the company have slumped from about $55 in early July to less than $30 this week. There’s also been instability in the corner office, with the chief executive, Brett Cairns, unexpectedly resigning “for personal reasons” on Monday. The Douglass separation is the biggest in the Australian fund manager world since the 2016 divorce of the Platinum Asset Manager founder, Kerr Neilson, and his wife, Judith, which resulted in him handing her a significant chunk of his $3bn fortune. Bad news for Kerr but good news for the news business, including Guardian Australia, which has benefited from the subsequent establishment of the Judith Neilson Institute. If divorce is bad for business, surely new romance brings back the bucks? Could a Hot Fund Manager Summer put a rocket under returns? Not according to the study. In the six months around getting married, fund managers underperformed by 3.13%, and they continued to underperform by 3.16% a year for the two years after walking down the aisle. “We argue that marriage and divorce are deeply personal events that distract fund managers from their investment duties,” the authors said. “These results provide strong evidence that the distractions associated with marital events are detrimental to professional portfolio management.”",News/Australia news,Separation anxiety: do fund managers’ marital woes spell trouble for investors? ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/11/separation-anxiety-do-fund-managers-marital-woes-spell-trouble-for-investors

12/11/2021,"Astranger visiting Feliks Zemdegs’s home might mistakenly accuse him of hoarding Rubik’s Cubes almost as fast as he solves them. “I’ve never counted them,” he says. “Probably over the years I’ve owned like 500 or 600, but at any given point in time probably only about 100 or 150.” The number still sounds ludicrous but the reality is more akin to Nike sending Rory McIlroy polo shirts and Head supplying Ash Barty with tennis rackets than an inclination towards the superfluous consumerism of multi-coloured 3D objects. Zemdegs is a two-time world-champion speed cuber, which makes him a prime target for companies with new wares to spruik. The Australian receives so many he gives them away. He has his own sponsor, anyway, and competes with the top-of-the-range Gan 356 XS. The model is the crème de la crème of the symmetrical six-sided enigma, a global pop-culture icon up there with comic books and Homer Simpson but less one-dimensional.  When used for sport every millisecond counts and Zemdegs, over the course of his career, has held 121 world records across the 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 5x5x5, 2x2x2, one-handed 3x3x3, 6x6x6, 7x7x7, and blindfolded 4x4x4 categories. In the blue riband event, the 3x3x3, he has broken his own record 13 times, and thus been crowned the Usain Bolt of cubing. Now, at 25 and with a career in finance, he is winding down. “The truth is I am extreme veteran,” he says. “I’m gradually, not so much getting slow, but there’s a lot of kids who are getting really, really fast.” So fast, in fact, that all of his records have been broken (his personal best is still a cool 4.16 seconds). This has occurred over the course of a decade since 2010 when, as a 14-year-old Melbourne school student, Zemdegs completed the three-layer configuration in a world-record time of 6.77 seconds and suddenly found himself under such a glaring spotlight that his parents became his default media managers. As fans lined up for autographs, he didn’t get what all the fuss was about. “The way that it was pitched to me by dad and others was that if I did it [media], it would raise the profile of speed cubing and more people will get into it,” he says. “That has really played out … the popularity has just completely exploded.” This is the Rubik’s Cube’s second coming. Invented by Hungarian architect Ernő Rubik in 1974, its initial craze lasted several years, a period during which about 100 million authorised cubes had been sold and many millions more cheap knock-offs. Books explaining how to solve it flooded the market. But the obsession with the equal parts alluring and exasperating contraption fizzled almost as soon as it started, and by the mid-1980s the pastime was considered passé. Even the converted consigned it to relic status. The media wrote obituaries – in 1986 the New York Times declared it “retired to the attic, the garbage heap”. There it remained until the noughties, when a new generation picked up the artefact and twisted it back into vogue. In 2004, the inception of the World Cube Association formalised speed cubing and from there, with help from the worldwide web, the 21st-century revival bloomed. And as its popularity went up, the times went down – the current 3x3x3 world record is held by Chinese 22-year-old Yusheng Du, who clocked 3.47 seconds in 2018. The competitive disciplines and sub-disciplines are seemingly endless. Single, average, blindfolded, one-handed, solve in fewest moves. Until recently the WCA recognised a category called “with feet”, which is exactly what it sounds like (American teenager Daniel Rose-Levine holds the Guinness World Record of 16.96 seconds). In January 2020, it was removed from the WCA’s list of official events because “with feet remains the least popular speed solving event by a significant margin, and concerns from organisers about hygiene and logistics remain”. At last weekend’s Rubik’s Cube World Cup, there were head-to-heads and a section requiring competitors to rescramble a cube into a certain configuration. Because of Covid-19, the 2020 and 2021 editions were conducted virtually using digital cubes; smartcubes, if you will. Bluetooth connects the cube to an app on contestants’ phones, which allows officials to accurately time results and online viewers to watch a floating interactive showing each progression live. Such an environment, though, requires adjustments to preparation. Zemdegs, who narrowly missed out on a podium place in the mixed speed cubing, spent the preceding weeks practising only on the cube sent to him by organisers. “Because the bluetooth cube has some electronics and stuff in it, it’s heavier than what people would usually use,” he says. “It’s a bit slower. The times are maybe a little bit worse than what I would do on a standard cube, but it’s probably pretty immaterial.” There is a clear chasm between the casual novice cuber and one serious about completing the puzzle in any sort of respectable time. The former group can solve the first one or two layers intuitively but will know well that, at some point, moving any further pieces will mess up what’s already been done. The latter, more elite group, will learn up to hundreds of algorithms made up of steps that look a bit like ‘F2 U’ R’ L F2 L’ R U’ F2’. “If I see a pattern and I want to get to the next stage of a solve, I know to do eight specific turns, and that will get me from that specific pattern to a more solved state,” Zemdegs says. “If you’re a beginner you might only need five or six to solve the cube, but people who want to get under 10 seconds will learn potentially hundreds.” As with most challenging endeavours, the key is patience and practice. Rote learn the algorithms and allow muscle memory to do its job. “Even the intuitive parts, you’re not thinking too hard during the solve, it’s mostly subconscious,” he says. In other words, it’s the all system one mode of thought – the fast and instinctive part of the brain which does not pause for deliberate thought. The common misconception is that, in order to achieve such mind-bending speed, one must be a genius. In film and television, the Rubik’s Cube has often denoted intelligence in characters. Think Will Smith in The Pursuit of Happyness and Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) using one to smuggle a micro SD card full of NSA files. But the reverse might actually be true – an exercise of this nature could help develop cognitive skills. In China, they are included in some school curriculums. It is the case for Zemdegs’s all-time rival and fast friend, Max Park, who is autistic. After being diagnosed as a small child, his parents tried almost everything to develop his stunted fine motor skills. One day he picked up a Rubik’s Cube lying around the house, and it was manna from heaven. The couple took him to competitions as a means of teaching him social cues such as pointing, standing in line and waiting his turn. “It was a giant playdate situation that we were going to exploit for Max’s social development,” Park’s father said in the 2020 Netflix documentary, The Speed Cubers. Park entered the scene when Zemdegs was at his peak. He had comfortably won the 2013 and 2015 world championships, and by the time 2017 rolled around was practically begging for a challenger. Around that time he found a YouTube video of a 16-year-old Park completing a one-handed 4x4x4 solve and tried but failed to beat it. Park was crowned 2017 world champion. Last month he set the world record for 3x3x3 average (from five solves) at 5.32 seconds, bettering the 5.48 seconds set in June by China’s Riuhang Xu – the only time this record has been broken by someone other than Park and Zemdegs since 2009. Park, who is currently world No 1 in all disciplines except for the 3x3x3 single, is Zemdegs’s biggest fan. “We were competing together in China, America and Europe,” Zemdegs says. “Because we were going to all these places I would spend a lot of time with him and his family. There’s a relationship or a bond between two people competing against each other at the top. You kind of have a rivalry, but it brings you together as well. Also, with the pressure you’re under, there’s a lot of empathy.” Much like Park, Zemdegs did not find cubing; cubing found him. In 2008, the then 13-year-old was perusing YouTube and happened upon a Rubik’s tutorial. “I didn’t know if you could solve that cube at all, let alone in 10 seconds,” he says. “I decided to buy a cube and learn from tutorials more advanced methods and techniques and algorithms. I went down that rabbit hole of practising and learning and improving.” That included committing the cardinal sin of bringing his new toy to the family dinner table “all the time”. It took his mother Rita a while to understand just how good he was. “He’s got a serious addiction – obsession,” she said on The Speed Cubers, “but also an amazing talent.” Zemdegs himself recalls becoming mesmerised by “a very self-reinforcing cycle … probably for most of my school year I would have been doing two or three hours a day of practice.” Can such a heavy training load give you RSI? He laughs. “I think it’s pretty rare. You would think so, but it’s not common at all. Over the years I have had sore forearms and been to the physio for massage. My forearms are really, really tight, but I just stop until they feel better.” Modern tournaments are bustling environments of mostly young spectators with smartphones and guileless commentators exclaiming “holy guacamole”. At the 2019 Red Bull World Cup in Moscow, 24-year-old German twins Sebastian and Philipp Weyer faced off on on stage and were separated by 0.001 seconds. An Instagram video of the solve has been viewed more than 3.3 million times. For some reason or another, cubing is a space mostly comprised of males. There are females trickling in, though, and French 20-year-old Juliette Sébastien is ranked 11th in the 3x3x3. In all it is elite but also inclusive. One is not a cubist in the way one might be a capitalist or a communist, but it is a sort of ideology nonetheless – with an emphasis on thinking not so much outside the box, but inside it. Rubik himself struggled with that notion for an entire month back in the ‘70s before finally completing his eponymous invention for the first time (he can now do it in roughly a minute, which he is not especially proud of but figures is relatively nimble for a 77-year-old). Originally made of wood, it was solid but yet also so incongruously malleable he was unconvinced it could ever be solved. Mathematicians later calculated there are 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 possible arrangements, of which only one is correct. In a 2020 interview with the Guardian, Rubik described the puzzle as “contradictory, a mix of simplicity and complexity”. “The Japanese slogan for it goes: ‘A Minute to Learn, a Lifetime to Master.’ You never finish it – there will always be new challenges/discoveries,” he said. “The design was also important, a good example of having everything you need and nothing more.” Rubik, a quietly spoken recluse, did not name the cube after himself – the manufacturers did that. Does he find that everlasting association burdensome? “It’s not like being known as Jack the Ripper,” he responds, presumably meaning no. He is just as philosophical about the digital age. “People say young people lose contact with the real world,” he says. “But while there are so many applications for the cube – 3,000 or more – they can, interestingly, play with these applications with the cube in their hands.” The pandemic has disrupted competitions – and the several days of socialising that come with them – but Zemdegs does not predict it will adversely affect the sport long term. “Once everything gets back to more normal we’ll see that it’s vastly more popular than it ever was,” he says, “Because people would have picked it up in lockdown.”",Sport/Sport,‘The popularity has just completely exploded’: Rubik’s Cube’s second coming,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/10/the-popularity-has-just-completely-exploded-rubiks-cubes-second-coming
12/11/2021,"Details of the shock decision to close Circus Oz are emerging as circus company members meet to try to save the revolutionary 44-year-old troupe, which started as an artist collective and put Australia’s larrikin spirit on the world stage. On Friday, the board of Circus Oz released a statement saying the members of the company had voted to reject reforms proposed by its funding partners – choosing instead to wind up its operations.  Former artistic director and co-CEO Mike Finch, who is one of the company members, said the wording of the announcement “failed to respect the intentions of the owners of the company” and had caused a day of “pain and confusion”. If the company winds up as proposed, 23 employees will lose their jobs, and more than 100 circus artists will lose access to the building and contracted work for their recently announced Melbourne show Everything But the Circus and other planned 2022 shows. “We are all feeling shocked,” Finch said. “I’ve seen messages posted that people are in tears because they think the membership agreed to close the company and that the members have let the artists down and now they are losing their jobs. “This is not correct. We certainly did not vote for the company to close. The members voted overwhelmingly for artists and workers to stay in control of the company,” he said. “This has been a coordinated attack on democracy in the arts, and it’s largely coming from people who don’t actually work in the arts, and certainly not in circus. “We all want to save the company – but to save the company, we must also save its soul, otherwise it is an empty shell.” The board’s announcement followed a lengthy internal review instigated by the Australia Council for the Arts. The review recommended significant structural reforms in order for the company to continue to receive public funds from the Australia Council and Creative Victoria. Among the 28 suggested reforms was a proposition to revamp the company’s 11-strong board. The current company constitution requires the board include four artists nominated by Circus Oz’s company members, a group of 100 made up predominantly of former employees. The members voted against a recommended change to make the board entirely skilled, removing the artist quota. The members also voted against a recommendation to reduce a barrier to membership, which stipulated members needed five years of experience with the company. According to the board’s statement, released on Friday: “The board have been compelled to confirm they cannot meet the government’s funding requirement and are now working on the process of closing the company … the board acknowledges this is a devastating blow to the current teams.” The members were made aware that a vote for the status quo would result in an end to public funding, said Mike McCreadie, the board’s treasurer. “We gave them that binary. They understand what the vote means.” A board restructure was always going to be difficult, McCreadie said, but he insisted change was long overdue. “Boards work best when you have a diversity of skill sets,” he told Guardian Australia. “We still want artists on the board but we want the best person to fill any skills gap and open it up to better reflect the cultural, age and gender diversity of the wider society. It’s very much a closed shop at the moment.” Finch said he was “shocked” by the board’s announcement, which came as “news to me”. Born from a melding of the radical spirits of Melbourne’s Pram Factory, the Soapbox Circus and Adelaide’s New Circus, Circus Oz was founded as a politically progressive, animal-free company. Over the decades, it evolved to become Australia’s de facto national circus and an influential larrikin ambassador for Australian culture in the wake of the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Circus Oz has performed in 27 countries, including the US, China, the UK and in a West Bank refugee camp. The company’s commitment to social justice issues – women’s rights, land rights for First Nations Australians and the treatment of asylum seekers, among them – hasn’t waned over the decades but box office receipts dived, even prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. Two Big Top shows in Sydney in 2015 attracted fewer than 1,000 people. In 2017, a tour of Queensland and New South Wales attracted fewer than 13,000. Concerns regarding Circus Oz’s financial stability led to the Australia Council placing the company on “fair notice” in 2018. In recent months, the company has relied heavily on the jobkeeper subsidy and combined grant income of $2.62m from the Australia Council and Arts Victoria. The company has been without a full-time artistic director for more than two years. NORPA (Northern Rivers Performing Arts) in Lismore, NSW, is one of the many regional venues to have hosted Circus Oz shows. Its artistic director, Julian Louis, called the news “really sad and surprising”, but said Circus Oz may have been reaching the end of its time. “Circus Oz has always been anti-establishment. A circus is innately anarchic. But the aesthetics of circus have changed over the past 10 years. So have the prevailing ideologies. An organisation has to evolve and I don’t know if Circus Oz was able to do this with the right dialogue between artistic vision and management. That’s what is tragic about this.” Louis said he understood the members’ resistance. “I think this is a case of passionate circus artists and staff saying, ‘We’re not bending to convention, or to ways that disempower artists or the art,’” he said. “Circus Oz has always seen itself as a community, above all else.

12/11/2021,"In Budapest, there is a bust by the Danube River. The face is bronze, and blank, so people can see their own faces reflected back at them. It is wearing a hoodie, with the bitcoin logo on the chest. It is a statue of the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto is the person or persons who developed bitcoin. They are anonymous and pseudonymous.  They created a decentralised, digital commodity which is now worth more than a trillion dollars globally. It is a peer-to-peer way of transferring money, skipping the banks. It’s encrypted with blockchain technology, which creates digital signatures to prove where the bitcoin has come from. You may have heard about Australian Craig Wright, who has been in the news recently thanks to a court case in the US. Wright is an influential entrepreneur. He might be Nakamoto. But he also might not. It is a mystery he could, in theory, solve in seconds (more of that later). This week Wright was fighting claims from the family of his deceased business partner, David Kleiman, that the pair co-created bitcoin. Therefore, they argued, half of more than $50bn of the original bitcoin belonged to them. Wright won the battle – a Florida jury found he did not owe the money. His lawyers said the pair were friends who worked together, but that their partnership was nothing to do with bitcoin’s creation. But behind that court case is a bigger story. Those bitcoin could only be owned by someone who was involved with the venture from the beginning – Nakamoto. Wright says he is Nakamoto, and Nakamoto is accepted as the creator of bitcoin. And to prove he is Nakamoto, Wright needs to show he controls some of those original bitcoin. Bitcoin expert Dr David Glance, a University of Western Australia computer scientist, says such a feat would be akin to King Arthur pulling Excalibur from stone. A proof of rightful ownership. “If you’re going to prove you are who you say you are, you just have to prove you have that key (to the bitcoin),” he says. “You don’t have to spend it, just move it from one account to another.” Of course, he says, it’s possible that Wright, or Nakamoto (or whoever he/she/they is/are) could have lost that key. Earlier this year the New York Times reported that as much as $140bn worth of bitcoin is lost to people who have forgotten or misplaced their keys. A UK man, Stefan Thomas, is one person who forgot his password, which would unlock hundreds of millions of dollars. When you create bitcoin, Glance says, it’s there, it’s available, it’s owned by the person who “mined” it. (Essentially huge amounts of computer power are used to solve algorithms to create new bitcoins.) That person then has the key to that bitcoin. Up until 2010, Nakamato was active online, discussing the development of bitcoin. They published their workings from the time of bitcoin’s conception, the bitcoin “white paper”, in 2008. Nakamoto shared plenty of their work, then went to ground just over a decade ago, only to pop up occasionally. Since then, around the world, amateur sleuths and computer experts and many others have been trying to work out who Nakamoto was – or is. Because whoever created bitcoin is an extremely rich person, and the enigma is an appealing story. In 2014, a triumphant media pinpointed Japanese-American man Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto as the Nakamoto, tailing him through Los Angeles. Cornered by reporters outside his home, the slightly disheveled man said he hadn’t heard of bitcoin before being contacted by the media, and asked about a free lunch. Later a post by a “Satoshi Nakamoto” popped up online, declaring they were not Dorian. Then they disappeared again. In 2015 various reports pointed to 45-year-old Australian Craig Steven Wright as being Nakamoto. “Probably”. Journalists had traced Wright’s online history back to 2008, and found various links that hinted Wright was set to release a cryptocurrency back then and an email that used the Nakamoto name but had Wright’s phone number. The Guardian reported the email discussed the possibility of lobbying then Australian senator Arthur Sinodinos about bitcoin regulation. Nakamoto made another appearance, saying he wasn’t Wright. Other names have been bandied about, including that of entrepreneur Elon Musk, whose tweets about cryptocurrency have the ability to see its value rise and fall.(Musk denied it.) But it’s still Wright who is the most-oft-speculated-about candidate for Nakamoto. And the recent court case centred around the claims of Kleiman’s family, who say Kleiman – who died in 2013 – was the co-creator of bitcoin. Glance says whoever Nakamoto is, it is someone who has mined a lot of the early bitcoin, which now just sits there on the blockchain, gathering metaphorical digital dust. Wright is a computer scientist. A website purporting to be his says he is the “creator of bitcoin – Satoshi Nakamoto”. It describes him as: “(An) eternal student and researcher. (Blockchain company) nChain chief scientist. Lawyer, banker, economist, pastor, coder, investor, mathematician, stats, and world-curious.” A 2015 Guardian article points to his LinkedIn page, which shows he has a PhD from Charles Sturt University, and a host of other academic qualifications. He was involved in various computer firms, and was the director of more than a dozen companies. He has had his share of previous legal trouble, and in 2016 his rented Sydney home was raided by the Australian federal police in a tax-related matter. At the time a police spokesperson said it was not related to any claims he was behind bitcoin. He was reportedly moving to London with his wife. That same year (2016) Wright promised he would offer proof that he was Nakamoto by transferring bitcoin from early in its creation, something only the creator of the entire cryptocurrency could do, because of the way the digital signature shows the history of the bitcoin transactions. He said he would present “extraordinary proof”. Just days later, he wiped that pledge from the internet, and replaced it with a message that said: “I’m sorry.” He did not have the courage to leave the shelter of anonymity, he said, but he didn’t say he wasn’t Nakamoto. In Florida, Kleiman’s family brought a civil case against Wright, claiming it was owed half of 1.1m bitcoin created at the start of the bitcoin enterprise. That bitcoin had to have been mined by someone who was there at the beginning, such as Nakamoto. And the family says Kleiman was with him at the beginning. That 1.1m bitcoin is now worth about $50bn. Experts testified that Wright owned the bitcoin, and he successfully defended himself against Kleiman’s family, although he had to pay out $100m in intellectual property rights. If the jury had found that Wright owed half to Kleiman, Wright would have had to transfer the bitcoin to Kleiman’s family, which would have proven he was Nakamoto. But they didn’t find that, so it remains a mystery (unless Wright uses the earmarked bitcoin to pay the $100m). Many banks are starting to offer cryptocurrency trades, which is unsurprising considering the interest in them, but also seemingly contradicts the notion of having a currency that bypasses financial institutions. Even the Reserve Bank of Australia governor, Philip Lowe, has signalled an interest in a retail form of cryptocurrency, although he doesn’t foresee them being used in general purpose payments. Bitcoin is the most widely used and well-known cryptocurrency. Once a fringe idea, more than 100 million people worldwide now use it. But bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are extremely volatile. Their value fluctuates wildly, so Glance says you won’t be able to buy a cup of coffee with them because the price would go wildly up and down. “The cryptocurrency world is full of colourful people with big imaginations,” he says. “The idea of it taking over the world hasn’t transpired.” It has, however, found a couple of niches. “It’s fuelling most of the cybercrime we’re seeing today,” he says. “And you can use it to buy drugs online, to extort people, to hire contract killers.” But you can speculate on it, as you would with shares, although Glance says it’s effectively gambling. The other reason he steers clear is the environmental impact needed for the immense computer power that creates it. Research shows creating bitcoin alone could create a carbon footprint the size of London’s. “(And) it has absolutely no intrinsic value,” Glance says. “It’s just a lot of people subscribing to a Ponzi scheme.” Most people will happily live their lives never using bitcoin. But it’s still an extraordinary mystery that somewhere out there is a person (or there are persons) who have shifted financial markets, and helped people make enormous fortunes.

12/11/2021,"The number of Australians challenging National Disability Insurance Agency decisions has exploded since July, with new data revealing a 300% increase in legal appeals. As the Morrison government confronts Labor claims about “stealth cuts” to funding packages, figures obtained by Guardian Australia confirm a huge rise in applications to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal over NDIS decisions.  These appeals generally mean a person with disability has seen their funding package cut, a requested support has been denied or the agency has rejected their claim to join the scheme. Between July and November 2021 the AAT received 2,503 NDIS appeals, compared with 590 for the same five-month period in 2020. This represents a 324% increase and means there have been more appeals lodged in the first five months of this financial year than all of 2020-21 (2,091 appeals). The number of participants in the scheme rose by 17% in October 2021, to 490,000, compared to the same time in 2020. The government argues appeals make up a small proportion of all participants, but the new figures directly challenge claims that the increase in appeals is explained by scheme growth. The opposition’s NDIS spokesperson, Bill Shorten, said the new figures obtained by Guardian Australia were “proof that there is an undeclared wholesale cutting of NDIS plans”. “These are massive increases in appeals, more than 300% in some instances,” he said. It comes as a growing number of NDIS participants speak publicly about how their packages have been drastically cut in recent weeks. Guardian Australia has reported warnings from a Perth mother who might have to quit her job due to cuts to her autistic son’s plan and how a Victorian man with motor neurone disease could be re-hospitalised after the NDIA stopped funding 24-hour nursing care. In another example later blamed in part on an agency “error”, a Victorian family that won transport funding in a landmark federal court case had this same money cut four years later. Disability advocates – who are funded to help people challenge NDIA decisions – have reported a deluge of requests for help from “terrified” NDIS participants. Last week, the NDIA issued a lengthy “clarification” statement about NDIS AAT applications. It followed reports, including in Guardian Australia, that noted a 21% increase in AAT appeals in 2020-21, compared to the previous 12 months. The NDIA noted the number of NDIS participants “grew by almost 20% during the past financial year”. It stated the “increase in total AAT cases [is] a result of the continued growth in participant numbers during this period”. Guardian Australia requested more recent data from the AAT after the NDIA published its “clarification”. And the latest figures back the anecdotal claims from advocates about an unusually large rise in appeals that cannot be explained by the fact more people have joined the scheme. For example, in November the AAT received 723 NDIS appeals, almost as many as there were across the entire second half of 2020. The backlog of cases at the AAT has also risen, from 913 unresolved appeals in November 2020 to 3,084 last month. Rachael Thompson, an advocate at the Rights Information Advocacy Centre, said there was total confusion in the community. She said requests for help were mostly about cuts to support the agency had previously funded. “No one knows what’s going on,” Thompson said. “There doesn’t seem to be a particular theme, it’s just … they seem to be reducing, systemically, people’s plans. “It’s seeming the NDIA are just choosing to ignore the recommendations from treating professionals, and only funding a quarter or half of what they’re requesting. People are being given explanations like, ‘It’s not value for money,’ [or] ‘We don’t have enough evidence.’” The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has warned about a cost blowout to the scheme, but scrapped “sustainability” planned reforms after they were rejected by the states. Internal documents obtained by Guardian Australia earlier this year suggested the agency had worked on other plans to tighten spending through operational changes that do not require legislation. While the AAT is designed for people to challenge government decisions without legal representation, advocates say NDIS participants are often pitted against externally contracted lawyers hired by the agency. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The agency has described the process as “an early resolution model that assists participants by working with them”. NDIS participants could expect to wait about 23 weeks – or about five months – to have their AAT appeals resolved in the 2020-21 financial year. An AAT appeal is only lodged after an internal review by the agency is unsuccessful, meaning the entire process is longer than this. An NDIA spokesperson defended the agency’s position on AAT appeals. “The statement issued on the NDIS website relates to figures released in the AAT’s annual report (1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021) and we provided comparable figures to 30 June 2021,” he said. “The agency acknowledges the increase in the number of AAT appeals since 30 June.” There were a “range of factors that might result in a participant’s plan value changing year on year”, the spokesperson said. A recent NDIS survey showed that in the September 2021 quarter, 84% of participants “rated the planning process as either good or very good”.

12/11/2021,"The fourth accuser to testify in Ghislaine Maxwell’s sex trafficking trial said Friday that she was only 16 when the British socialite gave her a nude massage at Jeffrey Epstein’s New Mexico ranch. This accuser, Annie Farmer, also said that the morning after her encounter with Maxwell, Epstein climbed into bed with her and said he “wanted to cuddle” and she “felt kind of frozen”.  “Do you see anyone in this courtroom who has ever given you a massage?” prosecutor Lara Pomerantz asked, shortly after beginning her direct examination. “Yes, I do,” Farmer said, saying that she was “wearing a brown sweater” and seated across the room, to her right. “Let the record reflect that the witness has identified the defendant,” Pomerantz said. “How old were you when Ms Maxwell gave you a massage?” “I was 16 years old.” Annie Farmer, who has chosen to testify under her full name, while other witnesses have been identified only by their first name or a pseudonym, gave a detailed account of how she met Epstein and Maxwell. She shared similarities with other accusers, including financial instability at home. Farmer, 42, told jurors in this federal court case in New York that she met Epstein at his Manhattan home in late 1995. Her sister Maria worked for him as a fine arts painter. Epstein bought her a plane ticket to New York, something she had not previously been able to do due to financial constraint. Farmer heard from her sister that Epstein was possibly “interested in helping me with my education”, she told the court. Farmer first went to his house with her sister, to pick up Phantom of the Opera tickets he had bought them. “He seemed very friendly and kind of down to earth. He was dressed casually,” Farmer said. They chatted and then Epstein’s driver drove them to the theater. The second time Farmer met Epstein was to go to the movies with him and her sister. Epstein sat between the two siblings. At some point during the film, Epstein reached over and “caressed” her hand, she said. “He was rubbing the bottom of my shoe and then rubbing my foot, my leg,” she said. “I was very nervous.” She felt “sick” and troubled by how Epstein would take his hand away when he turned to interact with her sister. Farmer said she did not tell her sister about what had happenedbecause Maria was “very protective” and she did not want to say anything that could jeopardize her sister’s employment with Epstein. In spring 1996, Farmer learned that she was traveling to see him again, for a weekend, at his New Mexico ranch, when her mother told her about the trip. “I was not eager to go to New Mexico,” Farmer recalled. But she felt a little bit more comfortable because there would be a woman there. “I’d been told that Maxwell would be in New Mexico with Epstein.” She thought that Maxwell and Epstein were “romantic partners, so I didn’t think he’d do anything like that when they were together”. When she arrived at the airport, she was driven to the ranch. “When I arrived, I saw Epstein, and then I met Ghislaine Maxwell,” she said. “She did not seem surprised to see me at all. She seemed to know who I was and [was] excited to see me.” They made several excursions into town. After they returned to the ranch, “it was decided that I would learn how to give Epstein a foot massage and Maxwell would show me how to rub his feet.” “I watched what she was doing, and she was instructing me. I did what she told me,” Annie Farmer said. “I felt very uncomfortable. I wanted to stop.” Then, Maxwell turned her attention to the girl. “She asked me if I’d ever had a professional massage,” Farmer said. “She said she wanted me to have that experience and would be happy to give me a massage.” There was a massage table set up in the room where she was staying. “Did Maxwell give you a massage?” Pomerantz asked. “She did.” Pomerantz asked Farmer what she was wearing during the massage. “Nothing.” “Why were you wearing nothing?” “She told me to get undressed,” Farmer said. “She said to get undressed and get [under] the sheet on the massage table, and I did. And then she, you know, started rubbing my body and rubbing my back and my legs,” Farmer said. “And while she was doing this, she was just, you know, making small talk, and then at some point in the massage, she had me roll over, so I was lying on my back.” “She pulled the sheet down and exposed my breasts, and started rubbing on my chest and on my upper breast.” As Farmer recounted this, Maxwell looked toward her accuser. “I just wanted so badly to get off the table.” Farmer’s unpleasant experience, as she recounted it, continued the next morning. She was in bed when Epstein “bounded into the room, saying he wanted to cuddle”. “He climbed into bed with me,” she said, saying that Epstein put his arm around her. “He pressed his body into me.” Annie Farmer said she told Epstein that she had to go to the bathroom, so she could escape this situation. The last day on Epstein’s ranch, Annie said that Maxwell no longer showed interest in the academic discussions they had once shared. That summer, Annie went on a cultural immersion trip to Vietnam. Epstein paid. She did not have any contact with Epstein or Maxwell after her return home.

12/11/2021,"The Conservative party has a reputation for being ruthless when it comes to disposing of leaders of whom it despairs. Margaret Thatcher was dispatched when her flagship policy turned into a political disaster. David Cameron jumped before he was pushed after losing the Brexit vote. Theresa May was pulled down following humiliating Commons defeats. Just two years after a famous election victory, Boris Johnson is possibly next in line to be humbled. The reason is not so much the scandals that have been lapping at Downing Street’s door for months. It is that even while dripping in fluid from the swamp, Mr Johnson’s instinct is not to be honest and accountable. That is why the prime minister has made a fool of his standards adviser, Lord Geidt, who believed his claim that he knew nothing about how the refurbishment of his No 10 flat was being funded when – WhatsApp messages revealed this week – he did.  What has unsettled Tory MPs is not that Mr Johnson is lying to voters or his staff, but that he has been lying to them. This makes next week dangerous for the prime minister. If a government with an 80-seat majority has to rely on the votes of the Labour opposition because it is split over pandemic restrictions, it will be on thin ice. If this is followed by the loss of a leave-voting rural seat in a byelection, the Tory party could embark on a civil war with only one outcome: the replacement of its leader. While the odds are shortening on a vote of no confidence, they remain long enough for Mr Johnson to hunker down in No 10. He might hope that Tory MPs will cut a new father some slack. With Christmas looming, Mr Johnson may believe politics could be reset after the holidays. The toxic charge for voters is that there is one rule for Downing Street and another for the public. This is hard to dodge for Mr Johnson: while ordinary people were being prosecuted for breaching Covid rules, his staff were apparently celebrating behind closed doors. Someone will probably have to pay when the cabinet secretary’s inquiry into last year’s festivities is released. Mr Johnson is an expert at shifting blame. Rather than taking responsibility for mistakes, he has a history of throwing allies under the bus. That might be why Downing Street’s press chief, Jack Doyle, who reportedly gave a speech at the Christmas party he denied had happened, remains in post. Sinking opinion polls suggest some voters have realised that Mr Johnson wears a clown’s mask to conceal his Machiavellian side. Rather than give the prime minister the benefit of the doubt, a growing slice of the electorate sees lies, not clever wordplay. Instead of laughing along, they realise they are being laughed at. The dysfunction within the Downing Street operation has been immensely damaging, with tensions laid bare by Mr Johnson’s former consigliere Dominic Cummings. The prime minister’s habit of making promises he has no intention of keeping is also catching up with him. The nature of the pandemic may have afforded Mr Johnson some leeway. However, many influential Tory MPs increasingly fret that the prime minister has frittered away his time in office with little to show but democratic backsliding. It explains perhaps why, despite his majority, Mr Johnson inspires so little loyalty. No cabinet minister this week defended the prime minister, which only emboldened Conservative MPs to criticise him publicly. If cases of the Omicron variant continue to rise, stricter measures will be needed. Mr Johnson’s inability to win over either the party or the public may prove his undoing – and have grave consequences for the country far beyond Tory politics.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson: odds shorten on a vote of no confidence | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/10/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnson-odds-shorten-on-a-vote-of-no-confidence
