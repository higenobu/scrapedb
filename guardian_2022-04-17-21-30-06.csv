4/17/2022,"Shoppers are being warned that the cost of a new sofa and other furniture is to race higher as the Russia-Ukraine war pushes up the cost of key materials such as timber. “We have never seen anything like this in terms of across-the-board price increases for materials,” said Sean Holt, the managing director of the British Furniture Manufacturers, the industry’s trade body. “It is putting a lot of pressure on manufacturing in the UK and that will have to be shared with retailers and consumers.” Higher furniture prices are already feeding into higher living costs in the UK. Inflation is running at 7%, the highest level in three decades, with furniture prices up 17%. The invasion of Ukraine is heaping more pressure on British furniture makers who had been sourcing timber from Russia. “We’ve seen a pattern of material increases over the last two years but the situation has escalated significantly in recent weeks,” Holt said. “Compound price hikes of up to 100% are not unusual, and this is on top of the energy cost increases affecting manufacturing. Fuel and labour costs are other factors. Our members are saying there will be further price hikes over the next few months.” At the end of last year, Ikea, the UK’s biggest furniture retailer, said it was putting up prices as it struggled to absorb a significant increase in costs, including for raw materials, transport and logistics, because of the upheaval caused by Covid-19. UK furniture manufacturing, which is focused on sofas, chairs and tables, is worth almost £13bn a year to the economy. However, a wide range of materials including hard woods such as birch, beech and oak, along with fabrics, foam, fibre, steel and MDF, were increasing in price, according to the BMF. Ian Oscroft, the managing director of the Nottinghamshire furniture maker Whitemeadow, said it now cost 25% more to make one of its sofas than before Brexit. “During the two years of Covid, the furniture industry has seen pretty excessive raw material costs and we thought that was over as we got into the new year but the conflict in Ukraine has exacerbated it even further. Timber is a key raw material and a lot of it comes out of eastern European forests, particularly birch and beech.” The Forest Stewardship Council has suspended all trading certificates in Russia and Belarus, blocking all controlled sourcing from the two countries, but the knock-on effect has been higher prices as firms scrabble to find alternatives. “The Forest Stewardship Council has put a ban on imports out of Russia, and rightly so, but what that’s done is put pressure on other countries who supply timber and, of course, that has made the price of timber rocket,” said Oscroft, who said his firm had to pay almost a quarter more for birch wood in April than the previous month. “We all try to swallow some of it,” he said. “I’ve not been able to pass a 25% increase to all my customers but I’ve had to pass some of it on. Similarly, retailers have had to pass some of that on, too. We can’t take all of the pain because if we did that we probably wouldn’t be here any more.”",News/Business,UK furniture prices to rise as war in Ukraine drives up cost of timber,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/17/uk-furniture-prices-to-rise-russia-ukraine-war-drives-up-cost-of-timber
4/17/2022,"A range of flapjacks have been found to be sweets rather than cakes and therefore subject to VAT, in a judgment that could have big financial implications for manufacturers of the treats. The tax tribunal ruled that 36 flapjacks produced by Glanbia Milk were not cakes, which are zero-rated for VAT purposes, because they would not be eaten for afternoon tea, were more commonly eaten on the go, were not baked and contained significant amounts of protein. Judge Christopher Staker and Caroline Small tasted four of the products and found them to be – unlike cakes – not aerated, and to have “a dense, chewy consistency similar to a fruit bar or an energy bar. The ordinary person would not consider this to be the typical texture of a cake”. The two-person panel said the Glanbia Milk products contained “significant amounts of protein, an ingredient not traditionally associated with cakes” and that a typical cake or “archetypal flapjack” would be “squarish rather than long and thin.” Its members also said that cakes were typically eaten at celebratory functions, while the flapjacks under scrutiny would be considered by the ordinary person to “look wholly out of place as a dessert at the end of a meal, or as the food to be consumed at an afternoon tea”. They added: “If held up to a group of contestants in a game where a point is awarded to the first contestant to call out correctly what the object is, the tribunal is satisfied that the majority of contestants would say spontaneously that the product is a ‘bar’, or a ‘fruit bar’, or an ‘energy bar’.” The case is reminiscent of the court battle between McVitie’s and HMRC in the 1990s when the UK’s tax authority unsuccessfully argued that Jaffa Cakes were biscuits and so should attract VAT. Glanbia Milk was appealing against a decision by HMRC that the company had incorrectly classified its flapjacks as cakes rather than standard-rated for VAT purposes. It made an application in the case to introduce samples of similar products with a zero rating made by rival manufacturers, but the tribunal panel questioned the relevance of this evidence and said it was not its role to determine whether other companies’ products had been correctly rated. Nevertheless, Staker and Small made a number of observations about the difference between “traditional” and modern flapjacks, which could have ramifications for other manufacturers. They noted that HMRC internal guidance states that flapjacks in general should be considered to be similar to cereal bars, which are classified as sweets, unless they are akin to those sold in the 1970s – when VAT was introduced – which were widely accepted as cakes. In its written judgment, the panel said: “Compared to a ‘standard’ flapjack purchased in a cafe or at a supermarket, the products in this case had fewer calories, about 10 times less sugar (with no sucrose or other standard sugar added), and very low levels of fat … “The ordinary person would not consider the products in this case to have the texture or appearance of a typical flapjack, let alone that of a typical cake.”",News/Law,"Flapjacks are too chewy to be taxed as cakes, judges rule",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/17/flapjacks-too-chewy-taxed-cakes-judges-rule-glanbia-milk
4/17/2022,"The civil servant in charge of the Home Office has said he does not have evidence to show the plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda will act as a deterrent. In a letter released at the weekend, Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary at the department, said that because the evidence was not available to justify the plan, he could not be sure it would provide value for money to the taxpayer. The release of the letter coincided with Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, using his Easter sermon to say the principle behind the plan “cannot stand the judgment of God”. The home secretary, Priti Patel, justified the Rwanda proposal on the grounds that the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats hoping to claim asylum in the UK has been rising sharply and that the prospect of being sent to Rwanda would act as a deterrent, disrupting the people smuggling trade. She also claimed the costs of the scheme would be a “drop in the ocean” compared to the long-term costs of allowing small boat Channel crossings to continue to increase. But in his letter Rycroft said he could not be sure this argument is correct. He told Patel: “Value for money of the policy is dependent on it being effective as a deterrent. Evidence of a deterrent effect is highly uncertain and cannot be quantified with sufficient certainty to provide me with the necessary level of assurance over value for money.” Rycroft wrote to tell Patel that she would need to issue a ministerial direction for the policy to go ahead. This is a rare procedure used when civil servants can not justify a policy on sound public spending grounds and decide to flag up their concerns so that ministers have to take a formal, political decision to override them. In his letter Rycroft stressed that he was not saying the policy would not work as a deterrent – just that it was impossible to know either way. “I do not believe sufficient evidence can be obtained to demonstrate that the policy will have a deterrent effect significant enough to make the policy value for money,” he said. “This does not mean that [the policy] cannot have the appropriate deterrent effect; just that there is not sufficient evidence for me to conclude that it will.” At the weekend the Home Office also released the text of Patel’s reply to Rycroft, in which she confirmed that she was issuing a ministerial direction. She said the asylum system is already costing the government £1.5bn a year and, while she accepts it is not possible to accurately model the deterrent effect of the Rwanda policy, “we are confident this policy is our best chance at producing that effect”. She also said it would be “imprudent … to allow the absence of quantifiable and dynamic modelling … to delay delivery of a policy that we believe will reduce illegal migration, save lives and ultimately break the business model of the smuggling gangs”. Britain has promised to pay Rwanda an initial £120m to launch the scheme. It will also pay a sum for every person resettled in the country, although these figures have not been disclosed. The Home Office is launching a £100,000 social media advertising campaigning telling potential asylum seekers, in their own languages, that the new policy that could see them sent to Rwanda if they cross the Channel in a small boat is already in place. In his sermon on Sunday, Welby said there were “serious ethical questions” about the proposal. “The details are for politics and politicians. The principle must stand the judgement of God and it cannot,” he said. “It cannot carry the weight of our national responsibility as a country formed by Christian values, because sub-contracting out our responsibilities, even to a country that seeks to do well like Rwanda, is the opposite of the nature of God, who himself took responsibility for our failures.” In response, the Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen accused Welby of “a little bit of naivety”, telling Sky News that he did not think the archbishop’s views were “in step with the views of the country”.",News/UK news,Home Office chief doubts sending asylum seekers to Rwanda will be a deterrent,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/17/home-office-chief-doubts-sending-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda-will-be-a-deterrent
4/17/2022,"Clipse legend Pusha T was asked recently who the three best “coke rappers” are. Push suggested Jay-Z, Jeezy and himself – humility’s never been the most prominent side effect of cocaine usage – but he should’ve nominated 21-year-old UK drill star Rhys “Digga D” Herbert. Just like drill, Digga has long been demonised by the authorities, but his thrillingly truculent, articulate flow has delivered a string of hits, despite being in and out of custody thanks to the Metropolitan police’s tender ministrations. Although it doesn’t quite touch the consistency of 2021’s Made in the Pyrex, this third mixtape’s moody volatility is utterly compelling. Less parochial than before, there are several nods to US rap, with features from Moneybagg Yo and B Lovee alongside hefty 50 Cent and G-Unit samples. Sadly, the sexism is as putrid as ever, slightly offset by moments of savage introspection – Hold It Down wonders wistfully about fidelity, and Addicted is a breathtaking drug ballad. He’s at his best seasoning various beefs – or describing other, less legal, types of cookery – and tracks such as What You Reckon prove that Pusha should rethink his list sooner rather than later.",Arts/Music,Digga D: Noughty By Nature review – utterly compelling,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/17/digga-d-noughty-by-nature-review-utterly-compelling
4/17/2022,"At the back of the Serpentine Gallery, among the spring blossom, is a strange vision of elsewhere. You must stand outdoors to see it, through a pane of glass darkly. At first it looks like a drop of milk, falling in slow motion, its splash rising in a delicate corona. Then it twists and expands, and twists again, like some dancing double helix. It is only a hologram, flickering in blackness, but the poetry exceeds the technology: it looks like an ever-growing Milky Way coming into view from some unimaginable distance. Inside the gallery is a wall pierced with peepholes at different heights, including several perfectly judged for small children. Put your eye to a hole, and beyond is the back of an immense head turned away from us in sepulchral gloom. Auburn tresses tumble down to the ground in a gleaming cascade, like the hair of some B-movie starlet on a giant silver screen. But is the head female, is it even meant to be a human being – who knows? The aliens have landed at the Serpentine and they are oddly familiar. A soundscape murmuring through the rooms fluctuates between gentle voices burbling in a kind of para-language with recognisable sentence structures, a waterfall of electronic music and the kind of intermittent radio interference that suggests someone out there is trying to talk to us. It is sweet-natured, innocent, melodic, and fetchingly designed by the French artist Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster in conjunction with the musician Julien Perez. Alienarium 5 involves collaborations with other artists too, in the design of a colossal carpet based on a vision of Uranus that ripples through the galleries, in the velvet breakout room and the group of virtual reality headsets that take you right out into the star-spangled universe to encounter alien beings. But the guiding vision belongs entirely to Gonzalez-Foerster. Born in Strasbourg in 1965, she makes sculptural and cinematic installations that tend to have a tragicomic personal narrative. I loved her shaggy dog video sending up a supposedly anonymous artist’s attempts to come up with something for the French pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 2009. She has made films, written novels, designed sets and even houses. What she creates is a public experience, rather than a work of art that can be sold in private. The big event at the Serpentine Gallery takes place beneath the central rotunda. It is a 360-degree pictorial panorama of – so to speak – aliens, for which you might read lone geniuses from every walk of life. Against a dark, intergalactic sky are images of William Blake and Ada Lovelace, Joseph Cornell and Andrei Tarkovsky, Alan Turing and Gustav Metzger. There are visionaries of all sorts, from Emily Dickinson to Odilon Redon, Rudolf Steiner to David Bowie. Loie Fuller, dancer and pioneer of theatre lighting (whose dance, not incidentally, was known as the Serpentine), appears alongside Hannah Höch, German Dadaist and pioneer of collage. It is an all-together-now of beautiful minds. And the nod to Höch is graceful, for this installation is nothing less than a colossal collage, enchantingly conceived and digitally achieved. From the voluminous darkness of outer space, all kinds of strange planets materialise: except that they turn out to be works of art, such as the glowing, stripy discs of the visionary painter Hilma af Klint and the cloudscapes of Georgia O’Keeffe, almost extraterrestrial in their abstract array of white lozenges aloft on cobalt. Other people’s ideas of aliens get in everywhere: ET appears next to Dickinson, a threatening triffid next to a giant Louise Bourgeois spider. There are many eerie film stills; of Dean Stockwell playing The Boy With Green Hair and David Bowie as The Man Who Fell to Earth, a humanoid with alien eyes, before he turns into the gentle Thomas Jerome Newton and is imprisoned and tormented by real human beings. Gallery guards hand out guides, and you may need them, especially if you’re not familiar with the faces of sci-fi writers from Philip K Dick to Octavia E Butler and Vonda N McIntrye. But this seems to me to be the entire point. For all the mildly specious talk, in the gallery promotions, of what would happen if aliens fell in love with people, this is in fact a massive consciousness-raising exercise designed to recognise human achievements. Not for nothing is the circular dome of the Serpentine Gallery emphasised, with the opening of a roof light; this is Gonzalez-Foerster’s 21st-century Pantheon. The VR headsets are delightful. Put them on and the cosmos comes drifting towards you out of darkness, contained in a sort of pulsing, sweeping, fluctuating light, a bit like morphing ectoplasm. Are we alone in the universe? To the age-old question comes a fanciful answer. As the ectoplasm floats around you, distant pinpricks of light get ever closer out of the darkness, until they materialise as active forms. Turn your head and suddenly there is a twinkling jellyfish on the left, or a tangle of luminous multicoloured spaghetti rippling in from the right – all floating in the most peculiar way. Bowie’s Space Oddity is the imaginary soundtrack running through your head. The visions are pure intergalactic hokum, and yet they are charming too, with the witty benevolence that characterises the whole show. And there is a certain melancholy as these amiable aliens start to depart, gradually fading away into the darkness: far out.

4/17/2022,"With aliens (friendly and not-so-friendly), cyborgs, love stories and serious dramas, 1982 produced some classic movies. As a Bristol video shop celebrates 40 years since first opening its doors to film fans, we look back at the top films of the year. ET Nominated for nine Oscars, Steven Spielberg’s family-friendly classic tells the story of a young boy called Elliott who befriends an extraterrestrial stranded on Earth after being left behind by his spaceship. Elliott and his family help the charming alien – dubbed ET by his friends – find a way of returning home despite being pursued by the authorities. Blade Runner Harrison Ford starred as burnt-out cop Rick Deckard in Ridley Scott’s return to sci-fi, set in a dystopian future Los Angeles in … 2019. Ford hunts down synthetic humans known as “replicants”, and features a monologue by Rutger Hauer which is lauded and parodied in equal measure. Tootsie The year’s second most profitable film after ET, this romcom tells the story of an actor, played by Dustin Hoffman, who assumes a new identity as a woman to land a role. Jessica Lange was handed the best supporting actress Oscar for her role as Julie Nichols. Gandhi Winning an impressive eight out of its 11 Oscar nominations, this biopic starred Ben Kingsley in the title role as Mahatma Gandhi, covering the key moments of the revered campaigner’s life. An Officer and a Gentleman Richard Gere’s turn as Zack Mayo, who falls in love with “townie” Paula (Debra Winger) while training to become an aviation officer, catapulted him to the very top of the A-list in this critically lauded drama, with many even rating it film of the year. Fitzcarraldo Werner Herzog’s West German epic wowed audiences with its audacity and Klaus Kinski’s magnetic turn as Brian Fitzgerald, who attempts to transport a steamship over a steep hill to access a rich rubber territory in the Amazon basin. Poltergeist Now recognised as a horror classic, Poltergeist tells the story of a family whose home is invaded by malevolent ghosts that end up abducting their daughter. Eating Raoul This failed to make a dent with the critics but is much loved 40 years on. Paul Bartel wrote, directed and even starred in a black comedy about a married couple who kill and rob rich swingers to pay for their dream restaurant. Sophie’s Choice Meryl Streep won the Oscar for best actress as she starred as Sophie, a Holocaust survivor who becomes close to a young writer called Stingo (Peter MacNicol) as she recounts the horrors she faced. Grossing $30m at the box office, the film was a phenomenal success among audiences and critics alike. The Thing John Carpenter’s stomach-churning Antarctic horror was panned at the time, but has only grown in stature over 40 years. The effects were cutting-edge in 1982 and still hold strong today – as does Kurt Russell’s growling lead performance.",News/UK news,Films of 1982: what was hot when 20th Century Flicks opened its doors,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/17/films-of-1982-what-was-hot-when-20th-century-flicks-opened-its-doors
4/17/2022,"Some arrive at the shop seeking rare films impossible to find elsewhere, while others come because they have grown disillusioned with the power of the streaming services and their algorithms. Regulars relish the good-humoured expertise of the movie-mad staff – and are keen to support the last of a dying breed. Against the odds, 20th Century Flicks, a DVD and VHS rental store in Bristol, has reached a landmark – its 40th anniversary – and is marking the moment with a festival showing films from the year of its opening, 1982. “It does feel like a milestone,” said one of the owners, Dave Taylor, who began working at the shop two decades ago when renting videos and DVDs was as routine as clicking on a Netflix or Amazon Prime is film is now. “It’s changed a lot but there is still a demand for what we do. People who use our service really value it and Bristol really loves its film. There are enough people in the city wanting to watch the stuff that we have.” The shopfront tells the story of what 20th Century Flicks is about. The sign features the iconic image of Béatrice Dalle from the poster of the French 1986 psychological drama Betty Blue and one of the walls is adorned with graffiti reading: “The Warriors”, a reference to the 1979 New York crime cult classic. DVDs given prominence in the shop window range from new arthouse films such as Céline Sciamma’s Petite Maman and Thomas Vinterberg’s Another Round to the 1964 British comedy The Bargee starring Harry H Corbett as a canal boatman. Videos include the 1953 Japanese classic Tokyo Story, On The Waterfront starring Marlon Brando from the following year – and Eating Raoul, a dark satire about a married couple who go on a murder spree to fund their dream of buying a house and restaurant in the country. Neatly, the film was released in 1982, the year the shop opened its doors. The most rented film is probably 1987’s Withnail and I. One of the stars, Paul McGann once borrowed the movie from the shop. Other favourite directors include Peter Greenaway, Ken Russell and Joanna Hogg. “Bristol has an arthouse aesthetic,” said Taylor. “That’s our bread and butter.” Among the regulars who arrived when the Guardian visited was Pixie Paine, a 39-year-old who works in social housing. The last film she rented was the 2012 psychedelic sci-fi Vanishing Waves from the Lithuanian director Kristina Buožytė. “They’re amazing here, so niche,” she said. She came to hire Empire Records, the 1995 coming-of-age movie that tells the story of a group of employees trying to stop their independent shop being sold to a corporate giant. But the shop doesn’t only cater for fans of the esoteric. IT consultant Paul Triffitt, 55, was returning Die Hard, Die Hard 2 and The Last Boy Scout. “We’ve been having a Bruce Willis season,” he said. It follows Steven Spielberg and Luc Besson extravaganzas chez Triffitt. “I like what they do here, I try to support them,” he said. The film has a library of more than 20,000 films so there is something for most tastes. If they don’t have a movie they will try to get it in and – even if it costs them a few hundred pounds, they will still rent it out for a few pounds. The aim is not to turn a profit but to break even and keep going. Officially the shop has 92,000 members and about 200 people regularly rent movies. The shop has diversified in recent years, opening two tiny screening rooms for eight and 10 people. They can be hired out and the shop puts on screenings. Another new attraction is the second shop window, which features lovingly made dioramas showing moments or objects from films such as Beetlejuice, Seven, Blue Velvet and Back to the Future. Visitors pause at the shop on Christmas Steps and peer in, trying to work out which some of the more obscure models represent. For the 40th anniversary, Forbidden Worlds (the name honours the 1982 sci-fi horror Forbidden World), the shop is reopening the mothballed Imax in Bristol and showing films over the weekend of 13-15 May. Films being screened include Blade Runner, Poltergeist and Eating Raoul – plus Hammer’s Dracula AD 1972 to mark the 100th anniversary of Christopher Lee’s birth. And then the plan is to battle on. Taylor said: “We’ll just keep going, renting out films, putting on festivals, making the odd diorama. It’s a satisfying life.”",News/UK news,‘There’s still a demand’: Bristol video shop celebrates 40 years in business,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/17/bristol-video-shop-celebrates-40-years-in-business
4/17/2022,"The European Union’s anti-fraud body has accused Marine Le Pen and several of her party members – including her father – of embezzling about €620,000 while serving as members of the European parliament. France’s investigative website Mediapart published a section of the new 116-report alleging that the MEPs misused EU funds for national party purposes. The claims come a week before the second round of the presidential election, on 24 April, in which Le Pen will go head to head with Emmanuel Macron. A spokesperson for Le Pen’s far-right Rassemblement National (National Rally) party questioned the timing of the accusations. Le Pen’s lawyer Rodolphe Bosselut told Agence France-Presse he was “dismayed by the way that Olaf [the European anti-fraud office] is acting”. He insisted some of the report related to “old facts, more than 10 years old”. “Marine Le Pen contests this. She contests it without having had access to the details of the accusation. It’s a manipulation; unfortunately, I’m not surprised,” Bosselut told the French channel BFMTV. According to Mediapart, Olaf sent the report to French investigators in March. It accused Le Pen of have personally diverted almost €137,000 of EU funds during her time as an MEP between 2004 and 2017. Her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen; Louis Aliot, her former partner and an ex-vice-president of the RN, who is now mayor of Perpignan; and Bruno Gollnisch, another party heavyweight, are also cited in the report as having misused public money. All have denied any wrongdoing. In one incident reported by Mediapart, Marine Le Pen is said to have made a claim in 2010 worth €5,000 for hotel rooms for 13 far-right party members to take part in a conference titled European Regions and the Financial Crisis. However, one of those taking part allegedly wrote to the European parliament and claimed the meeting was used to discuss the party presidency. The unnamed participant told investigators that Le Pen had hung a European flag on the way for the purpose of having photographs taken, then ordered colleagues to “put that shit away”. The Paris public prosecutor’s office has said the file is “being examined”. None of those mentioned in the report are accused of personally profiting, but of claiming EU funds to pay for RN – previously the Front National (FN) – staff and events instead. Le Pen has said she was not aware of having done anything wrong. Le Pen has been under investigation since 2018 on allegations of “breach of trust” and “misuse of public funds” over the alleged use of EU money for European parliamentary assistants to finance the salaries of party staff. The same year, an EU court ruled the bloc could recover more than €41,000 of public funds that Le Pen had used to pay her bodyguard, a former paratrooper who was her father’s security for 20 years. Bosselut said Le Pen had “not been summoned by any French judicial authority” and accused the European authorities of failing to send him or Le Pen the final report. He said the Olaf investigation was opened in 2016 and Le Pen was questioned in writing by post in March 2021. The latest opinion poll published by Ipsos for FranceInfo and Le Parisien suggests Macron could win next week’s runoff by 10 percentage points. Both candidates are attempting to woo supporters of the radical left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who narrowly failed to qualify for the second round. On Sunday, Mélenchon published the result of a consultation of 310,000 paid-up supporters as to how the 7.7 million people who voted for him last week would vote next Sunday. Of the more than 215,000 who took part, almost 38% said they would cast a blank vote, while 33.4% said they would vote for Macron and just under 29% said they would abstain. “The result of this consultation is not an instruction to anyone. It indicates the opinions of the 215,292 people who participated. Everyone will conclude and vote according to their own conscience,” Mélenchon’s campaign team said in a statement.",News/World news,EU anti-fraud body accuses Marine Le Pen of embezzlement,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/17/eu-anti-fraud-body-accuses-marine-le-pen-france-election
4/17/2022,"“War is over!” shout the outraged inhabitants of the remote island of Lubang – but Lieutenant Hiroo Onoda doesn’t want it, won’t have it and is liable to shoot anybody who so much as points it out. The commando, we learn, is under strict orders to keep the Pacific theatre open and the US forces out of the Philippines, and never mind the fact that the world has long since moved on and there’s rock’n’roll music on his crystal wireless set. Along the way, the director, Arthur Harari, takes the exhausted true tale of the lone Japanese soldier and sculpts it into a captivating tragicomedy, a sharp-eyed study of zealotry and self-delusion, ridiculous and heartbreaking in about equal measure. Onoda (played in his youth by Yûya Endô; in later years by Kanji Tsuda) starts out commanding a small unit of fellow grunts. Harari shows them wandering the jungle like JM Barrie’s lost boys, occasionally running on to the beach to startle the local fishermen.
