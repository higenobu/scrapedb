4/22/2022,"The Salvation Army, one of the UK’s best known and well funded charities, has been accused of acting like “a rogue landlord” by leaving some of its private tenants exposed to “serious” hazards for at least seven years.The Christian organisation, whose charitable objectives include “the relief of poverty … suffering, distress” and “the assistance of those in need of protection”, ignored repeated requests to improve conditions by its tenants in Hadleigh, Essex. The town is the site where the group’s founder, William Booth, created his first farm colony in 1891 to help people escape the deprivation of London’s East End.Tenants have complained of being subjected to years of living with hazards including fire risks, damp, and vermin infestations, an investigation by the Guardian and ITV News found. Presented with the investigation’s findings the Salvation Army issued an “unreserved apology” and said it had now begun the process of surveying the properties and renovating vacant homes as part of an urgent action plan. The local council, Castle Point, said it had now served improvement notices on a number of Salvation Army properties in Hadleigh, compelling the charity to act. Tenants say the problems with the properties were first documented in late 2014. Later, in 2018, the charity left up to 40 tenants with the impression they were about to be evicted instead of paying to correct the problems. In 2019, a local environmental health officer at Castle Point council wrote to the Salvation Army and described the charity’s handling of the situation in Hadleigh as a “sordid mess”. The letter said he had identified “significant housing disrepair in Salvation Army properties” in the borough including “category one and two hazards”. Category one hazards are the most serious housing problems. They include risks of “death, permanent paralysis, permanent loss of consciousness, loss of a limb or serious fractures”. The Guardian and ITV News understands that conditions within tenants’ homes have not improved since the council’s warning three years ago.The length of time the Salvation Army failed to deal with the complaints raises serious questions about the governance and conduct of one of the UK’s highest profile charities. The Salvation Army receives donations and legacies from the public of more than £100m a year and owns more than 1,700 residential properties, the majority of which are used by its own officers. Last year the charity announced it was constructing a new headquarters for itself at a cost of £32m. In Hadleigh, it owns about 40 homes, with 26 concentrated on the two worst affected streets, Mount Zion and Seaview Terrace. Steve Mackenzie, an independent fire safety expert, who inspected one property for the Guardian and ITV News, said that building was a “fire trap” for a number of reasons. He said: “The inadequate fire detection. There are no CO2 detectors. There is no separation of the roof from one flat to the other … We’ve also got an electrical system that has been condemned at some point. And the list goes on.”He called the Salvation Army’s conduct towards its Hadleigh tenants “delinquent, negligent, [a] breach of legislation, criminally negligent.” He added: “The defects we are seeing in statutory contraventions are unforgivable. It is not allowed and they are delinquent under law.”A second expert, Jeff Charlton, managing director of the environmental health consultancy Building Forensics, inspected a different Salvation Army property in Hadleigh, and found mould on a wall next to the bed of an asthmatic child. “All mould is a health risk,” he said. ““There’s no real excuse. People are being made sick or their health is deteriorating living in this property. There is a responsibility under landlord and tenant act that the landlord makes the home health and safety compliant ... Of course [the landlord] is negligent”.Peggy Jane Smith, a Salvation Army tenant in Hadleigh for 38 years, whose property was found to be a fire risk, said: “[The Salvation Army’s] behaviour [has been] of a rogue landlord. It’s very hard to try and tell people that because it’s not what people want to believe, but the unfortunate thing about the Salvation Army is, on the one side they have their spiritual side, but on the other side they’re behaving like hard-nose, unscrupulous, capitalists.” Smith said she believed the charity intended to evict tenants in 2018. At a meeting with Hadleigh tenants that June Alan Read, the Salvation Army’s managing director and its secretary for business administration, described the charity as “an accidental landlord”. He added: “Being a commercial landlord is not an objective of the Salvation Army. We’ve come into it by accident really.” At the meeting, Read repeatedly declined to guarantee that the Salvation Army – which is perhaps best known for its work with the homeless – would not evict its tenants. Rebecca Harris, the MP for Castle Point, said she had been in meetings with the Salvation Army over a number of years to try to bring all the properties up to a good condition. She said: “They kept making promises that failed to materialise. Ordinary members of the Salvation Army would be mortified to know how incompetent their properties department has been. “The biggest fear for the tenants and myself, was that they would claim the properties were beyond economic repair, knock them down and evict families. I kept pressing the Salvation Army to get on and do the work, but they’ve left the tenants waiting for them to get their act together, which has been incredibly stressful for them.” The Salvation Army declined to offer any of its senior officials for an interview, nor did it explain why it had taken so long to start addressing the issues. It said it had planned to start work in 2020, but was delayed because of the pandemic. The charity issued a statement in which Anthony Cotterill, the charity’s territorial commander, said: “The condition of these houses is unacceptable. It is clear that we let down the tenants of Seaview Terrace and Mount Zion and I am deeply sorry. As well as an unreserved apology, I would like to offer reassurance that for some months now we have been working on an urgent action plan to bring these properties up to the correct standard. “Our tenants are right to be angry but with the help of our new property director, appointed in May 2021, we are confident that we are now taking urgent action to right these wrongs. Further senior appointments to manage planned works will also support the improvements process.” The charity added that its new headquarters would be funded from proceeds of the sale of its old headquarters.",News/UK news,Salvation Army in UK accused of ‘rogue landlord’ attitude,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/21/salvation-army-in-uk-accused-of-rogue-landlord-attitude
4/22/2022,"Women are being left unable to sleep or work competently because of the shortages of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) products used to treat symptoms of the menopause, the former cabinet minister, Caroline Nokes, has warned. Millions of women go through the menopause every year, with many experiencing symptoms that can be severe, such as low mood, anxiety, hot flushes and difficulty sleeping, and have a negative impact on everyday life. The number of prescriptions for HRT in England has doubled in the last five years to more than 500,000 a month. But the rise in prescriptions has come amid several years of HRT shortages, with pharmacists often unable to fulfil prescriptions. Shortages have been blamed on manufacturing and supply issues, and have been exacerbated by the growing numbers of women seeking the products. Speaking in the Commons on Thursday, Nokes, chair of the Women and Equalities Committee, called for an urgent debate on the issue to ensure women “can get the supplies that we need”. “Pharmacies in Romsey and Southampton North have completely run out, which leaves women of a certain age – and before my honourable friend from North Dorset makes a comment … yes, I declare an interest – without access to the oestrogen gel, which enables us to sleep and to work competently. “Please, will the leader of the house arrange for a debate in this place following on from the brilliant debate by the right honourable lady for Swansea East to make sure that pharmacies are working hand in glove with the DHSC so that we can get the supplies that we need?” Mark Spencer, the Commons leader, said: “I can say the Department of Health and Social Care is aware of the supply issues that are affecting a limited number of HRT products. However, most HRT products, including alternatives to those experiencing supply issues, are available. “The government is working closely with suppliers and stakeholders to resolve these issues as quickly as possible, and to ensure the NHS is informed on a regular basis.” In October, the government announced that the cost of repeat prescriptions for HRT would be significantly reduced in England. In the Commons on Thursday, Labour MP Nick Smith asked Spencer why there was “no date yet for the HRT prescription changes in England”. Spencer said it was “something the health secretary is looking at, at this moment in time”. Symptoms of the menopause and a lack of support force some women to take time off work and even leave their jobs, according to research. A poll of 3,800 women in the UK conducted last year found most felt the menopause or the months and years leading up to it – the perimenopause – had had a huge impact on their careers. The survey for menopause medic Dr Louise Newson, who runs the not-for-profit Newson Health Research And Education, found 99% of women felt their perimenopausal or menopausal symptoms had led to a negative impact on their careers. More than a third described the impact as significant. About 59% took time off work due to their symptoms, with 18% off more than eight weeks. Reasons for taking time off included reduced efficiency (45%), poor quality of work (26%) and poor concentration (7%). Half of those who took at least eight weeks off work resigned or took early retirement. Three in five (60%) women said their workplace offered no menopause support.",News/Society,Women in England struggling to sleep and work amid HRT product shortages,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/21/women-in-england-struggling-to-sleep-and-work-amid-hrt-product-shortages
4/22/2022,"My friend Godfrey Fowler, who has died aged 90, was a leading and reforming family doctor for 30 years; he was warm, modest and convivial. For much of his career he also headed a department of medical general practice at Oxford University, training students and undertaking research into preventive medicine. Godfrey was founding clinical reader in the new department from 1978, having been persuaded to take this role by Sir Richard Doll, then regius professor of medicine. The department became what is now the large and successful Nuffield department of primary care sciences. Godfrey took the role part-time, so he could continue as a GP. His first challenges were to devise new general practice teaching, such as in consultation skills, and to convince Oxfordshire GPs to provide up to 70 placements a year – a target he met successfully. Godfrey was born in the village of Wolverley, Worcestershire, the eldest of six. His parents, Donald, a businessman, and Dorothy (nee Bealey),a homemaker, had both left school at 14. After attending Sebright school, Godfrey won an exhibition to University College, Oxford, to study medicine, graduating in 1954 and then moving to further work at University College hospital, London (1954-59). He specialised in obstetrics, gynaecology and paediatrics, but his interest in general practice was strong and he became a GP in Oxford in 1961. His Beaumont Street surgery cared for CS Lewis and the Nobel prize winner Lord Florey among its patients. He was invited to become college doctor at the Queen’s College and later other colleges. Keen to improve the service available to students, he played a significant role in establishing student counselling at the university. Godfrey’s research at the university focused on preventive medicine and improving primary care, especially in the transfer of chronic disease from hospitals to the community, exploring the effect and cost-effectiveness of such changes. He sought better ways of helping smokers to stop and to help people adopt healthy eating habits. He also investigated the effects of GP-conducted health checks and advice on cardiovascular disease and cancer risk; another study examined “shared care” records in patients newly diagnosed with cancer. His books for Oxford University Press included two on preventive medicine (1987 and 1993) and Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease (1996); he also edited a series on general practice for OUP. Godfrey became a professorial fellow at Balliol College and a fellow of the Royal College of General Practitioners in 1978 and a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1996. He became honorary director of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund’s GP research group in 1987. He was appointed OBE in 1989. For many years Godfrey was a keen member of Sir Roger Bannister’s regular walking group of Oxford academics. After retiring from his post as chair of general practice in 1997 he enjoyed fell-walking, completing the Annapurna Circuit and the Tour de Mont Blanc. He also loved gardening and had an active social life within his two Oxford colleges, University College and Balliol. Godfrey married Sissel Vidnes in 1961. He is survived by Sissel, their elder son, Jeremy, and a grandson. His younger son, Adrian, died in an accident in 1995.",News/Education,Godfrey Fowler obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/21/godfrey-fowler-obituary
4/22/2022,"Russia has been hiding evidence of its “barbaric” war crimes in Mariupol by burying the bodies of civilians killed by shelling in a new mass grave, the city’s mayor said on Thursday. The mayor, Vadym Boichenko, said Russian trucks had collected corpses from the streets of the port city and had transported them to the nearby village of Manhush. They were then secretly thrown into a mass grave in a field next to the settlement’s old cemetery, he said. “The invaders are concealing evidence of their crimes. The cemetery is located near a petrol station to the left side of a circular road. The Russians have dug huge trenches, 30 metres wide. They chuck people in,” he said. The mayor estimated that more than 20,000 Mariupol residents had been killed since Russian forces began attacking the city during the early days of Vladimir Putin’s invasion. Most corpses had now been removed, he said, with some disposed of in mobile crematoriums. Boichenko denied claims by Putin that the city had been “liberated” by Russia. He said Ukrainian soldiers remained holed up in the Azovstal steel factory on Mariupol’s left bank, together with between 300 and 1,000 civilians, including women and children. “We don’t know the precise civilian figure because we haven’t been able to get them out. We need a day’s ceasefire for this to happen,” he told the Guardian. The civilians were living in desperate conditions in a network of underground tunnels, surrounded by Russian troops. Speaking in Moscow on Thursday, Putin ordered his forces not to storm the sprawling factory complex, after his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, admitted that the Russian army was still fighting thousands of Ukrainian soldiers there. The Russian president described a plan to penetrate the complex as impractical. He called instead for a blockade of the area “so that a fly can’t get through”. Putin told Shoigu, in remarks broadcast on state television: “There is no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground.” Ukraine scoffed at the idea that a Russian victory in Mariupol was already achieved.“This situation means the following – they cannot physically capture Azovstal. They have understood this. They suffered huge losses there,” said Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Boichenko said that about 100,000 people remained in Mariupol in Russian-occupied areas. Another 100,000 had successfully escaped, mostly in private cars, while 40,000 had been forcibly deported to Russia. Others were being held in so-called Russian “filtration camps” outside the city, he said. The mayor said 80 people managed to get out on Wednesday in four buses and successfully crossed into Ukrainian-government controlled territory. No evacuation took place on Thursday, he added, because Russia shelled the meeting point where residents were told to gather. “People are being tortured in these camps. Not just men but also women are being filtered. It’s a terrible ghetto. They are looking for people connected with the municipality. Russia is using the same fascist methods employed by the Nazis. It’s fascist Russia,” he said. In the face of stubborn resistance the Kremlin appears to have made a tactical decision to starve Mariupol’s last Ukrainian defenders into submission. After failing to take Kyiv, Moscow says its new war aim is to seize the administrative borders of Donetsk and Luhansk. The Russian have shifted part of their attacking forces from Mariupol further north. In its latest intelligence update the ministry of defence said Russian battalions were likely to make “significant” advances in time for 9 May and the annual victory day parade in Red Square in Moscow. Two key targets are the eastern Ukrainian cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. In the absence of a clear-cut victory a Russian T-80 tank crew performed a celebratory spin in a Mariupol square, crashing through a barrier. The encircled Ukrainian army has practically run out of ammunition, limiting its ability to counter attack. A Russian T-80 in Mariupol.Note the specific gas turbine sound. pic.twitter.com/RdcxM4FuBq “The Russian agenda now is not to capture these really difficult places where the Ukrainians can hold out in the urban centres, but to try and capture territory and also to encircle the Ukrainian forces and declare a huge victory,” said Chris Parry, a retired British rear admiral. Parry said this amounted to a change in “operational approach”. He added: “They’ve realised if they get sort of held up in these sort of really sticky areas like Mariupol, they’re not going to cover the rest of the ground.” The apparent change in Russia’s approach might also be a reflection of the mounting casualties it has suffered in the war. The Russian defence ministry has refused to say how many sailors died on board the Moskva cruiser, which sank last week, leading angry parents of soldiers to go public with demands for the government to find their children. Putin’s public appeal to “protect the lives” of Russian soldiers mighty indicate that the Kremlin is concerned it appears indifferent to its losses, critics said. “When Putin says something publicly, it is almost always a consequence of the fact that the [Kremlin] has taken measurements of public opinion and has come to the conclusion that now it is necessary to speak in order to earn political points,” wrote Leonid Volkov, an ally of the jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny. Andrei Turchak, head of the ruling United Russia party, appeared in a Mariupol school this week to declare that “victory will be ours, the enemy will be defeated”. Andrei Kolesnikov, of the Moscow Carnegie Centre, wrote: “It is logical to assume that Putin should equate his ‘victory’ with victory in 1945 and celebrate it on 9 May. But judging by the way the operation is going, he may prolong the hostilities, and 9 May will be just a day to achieve intermediate goals.”",News/World news,Russian forces accused of secret burials of civilians in Mariupol,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/russian-forces-accused-of-secret-burials-of-civilians-in-mariupol
4/22/2022,"Santander is cutting its opening hours at hundreds of branches, saying it is responding to changing customer habits. The bank said all but four of its branches would now shut at 3pm on weekdays instead of the current 4.30pm, while more than two-thirds would close at 12.30pm instead of 4pm on Saturdays. Pre-booked face-to-face appointments will be available outside the new hours in certain cases. The changes, which take effect on 18 July, follow branch closure announcements by a number of rival banks. Lloyds Banking Group said in March that it was axing 60 branches , and HSBC recently said it is shutting 69. Santander said there would be no closures as part of its changes, and that all of its 450 outlets would remain open every weekday. In March last year the banking group announced the closure of 111 branches across the UK – a fifth of its network. The new Monday to Friday opening hours of 9.30am to 3pm apply to all branches except for three that are in shopping centres, plus an outlet in Leeds. The bank said that between 3pm and 5pm on weekdays, staff would be available to see customers who needed help that could not be provided through alternative channels or earlier in the day, and a similar arrangement would apply to the 316 branches moving to half-day Saturday opening. The bank has blamed the changes on a drop in branch usage and a switch to digital banking. It said the number of customers using its branches fell by 33% over the two years before the pandemic, then by a further 50% in 2020, and 12% in 2021. It added that to strengthen telephone support for customers, branch staff would be trained to help people on the phone alongside their current face-to-face roles. Branch staff helping customers who call on the phone was introduced as a pilot during the pandemic. There will be no compulsory redundancies or reduction of employee working hours as a result of the changes, said a spokesperson. Jenny Ross, money editor at consumer body Which?, said Santander “deserves credit for taking greater account of customer needs than some of its rivals that have slashed their branch networks without putting in place reasonable alternatives”. But she added: “This continues a concerning overall trend of banks chipping away at face-to-face services and opening hours … The government must announce, in next month’s Queen’s speech, the legislation it has promised to protect cash for as long as it is needed.”",News/Business,Santander to reduce opening hours across hundreds of branches  ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/21/santander-to-reduce-opening-hours-across-hundreds-of-branches
4/22/2022,"My dad, Roy Rhodes, who has died aged 76, started his working life as a printer, but was later able to make a move into conservation work, first at a reservoir in Bolton and then looking after much of the land owned by the water company United Utilities, across an area that stretched from Carlisle to Crewe. Roy was born in Bredbury, Cheshire, the son of Eddie Rhodes, a confectioner, and his wife, Mary (nee Gorman), and lived there until the family moved to Lancashire when he was seven, after Eddie became manager of Sovereign Toffees in Lowton. Roy went to Leigh grammar school, where he turned every English assignment into a birdwatching story and ducked out of cross-country runs to drink tea at a mate’s house, rejoining the stragglers on the final lap. Leaving school at 16, he was unwillingly apprenticed as a printer, but the need for accuracy, an eye for detail and design, and the convenience (for birdwatching) of night shifts suited him better than he first imagined. He worked first as a linotype compositor at PT Brooks in Leigh, before going to the Warrington Guardian newspaper and then the Bolton Evening News. In April 1972 he met Jennifer Walsh, a teacher, and they married in December of the same year. Five years later, while Roy was in Lapland on a birdwatching holiday with friends, a co-worker saved a job advert for him, knowing it would suit him to a T. They were right, and he became the first countryside ranger at Jumbles reservoir in Bolton, owned by North West Water (now United Utilities). He developed and refined the scant job description. In time he was appointed conservation officer for United Utilities with responsibility for all its land holdings, and he continued to work for UU until his retirement in 2004. His work included surveying and protecting particular species of plants, animals and insects, and balancing the needs for public access, recreation and education with safeguarding the natural landscape. A keen and skilled photographer, Roy developed slide shows of things that he saw in the course of his work. These went far beyond the species identification style of the time, and told rich stories of areas and their ecology. He set key sequences to music, including a sun rising on Chat Moss near Manchester to the Meditation from Massenet’s opera Thaïs. Even many years later he was approached by audience members who had been influenced by these talks from the 1970s to the 90s.

4/22/2022,"Dan Burn believes Eddie Howe’s transformation of Newcastle’s fortunes should make him a strong contender to rival Jürgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola for the manager of the season award. Burn has excelled in central defence since arriving at St James’ Park for £13m from Brighton in January, playing a big part in Newcastle’s rise to the security of 11th place in the Premier League on 40 points. It now seems hard to credit that when Howe succeeded Steve Bruce in November Newcastle had not won a game and their new Saudi Arabian-led owners were contemplating a chastening relegation. “It’s some achievement to have gone from where we were when the new ownership came in to our position now,” said the Northumberland-born Burn, who grew up supporting Newcastle. “The atmosphere here now reminds of when I used to come to St James’ Park as kid and watch the team playing in the Champions League.” If £90m of January signings – Burn, Bruno Guimarães, Chris Wood, Kieran Trippier and the Aston Villa loanee Matt Targett – helped Newcastle’s cause, much of the metamorphosis is down to Howe’s meticulous coaching and man-management. “After turning it around the way he has, he’s a real contender for manager of the season,” said Burn. “It’s about the mentality he’s brought in, the way we train, the sense of real togetherness he’s created. It’s brought the players and the fans closer together; we’re all pulling in the same direction. “You’ve got managers like Klopp and Guardiola but what Eddie Howe’s done is equally impressive. It’s a monumental achievement to take this club from the state it was in and to get to 40 points with five games to go.” Burn was speaking shortly after Newcastle had beaten Crystal Palace 1-0 on Wednesday and Yasir al-Rumayyan, the club’s Saudi-based chairman, had joined other board members, staff and players in posing for one of the celebratory group photographs Howe insists are taken after every victory. “I knew it was a risk leaving Brighton,” Burn said. “If we’d gone down I might never have played Premier League football again but I fell in love with this club as a kid and I was never going to turn it down. I let my heart rule my head. I was desperate to come here and now everyone’s buzzing about what the future might bring. “The atmosphere and positivity feels like the old Champions League days. I certainly hope we can finish in the top 10 this season.” Targett is similarly optimistic. He has impressed hugely at left-back and, like Burn, has no regrets about saying yes to Howe. “It’s been an unbelievable turnaround,” he said. “This club was in quite a dark, dark place until the new owners came in. But the team’s really stepped up under the new manager. “The first thing I noticed was that training’s really intense. We do certain drills daily so the manager nails what we need to do in certain areas into our heads. But this season has to be just a stepping stone.”",Sport/Football,Newcastle’s Dan Burn backs Howe as contender for manager of the season,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/eddie-howe-manager-of-the-season-newcastle-dan-burn
4/22/2022,"The efforts of Formula One’s biggest teams to raise the sport’s budget cap are an attempt to claw back an unfair advantage and indicative of poor planning, according to the Alpine team principal, Otmar Szafnauer. With the cap intended to level the playing field, Szafnauer insists teams are using claims of inflationary pressure as a smokescreen to spend more looking for performance and said that he and others will attempt to prevent any regulation change. F1 introduced a budget cap for the first time in 2021. It was set at $145m and this year dropped to $140m. It is due to further decrease to £135m next year. The measure was seen as vital to control ever spiralling costs and to close the performance differential between the big three, Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull, and the rest of the field. The process was difficult for the major teams, who had to let staff go and adapt to operating without an ability to merely throw money at problems. It was welcomed by the midfield teams who in most cases were already spending below the cap. This season, however, there has been a vociferous call to raise the cap again to $147m, which Szafnauer maintains is actually evidence the system is working. “If it wasn’t going in the right direction the big teams now wouldn’t be crying to increase it,” he said. “It’s ironic that once the season is underway and the relative performances of the cars are known, people want to increase the budget cap.” The argument being made in favour of increasing spending is that global inflationary pressure has increased costs in areas such as logistics and freight. Szafnauer insists that potential inflation issues were well known in December when budgets are decided. He contends that they would have planned for those pressures and that teams were once more seeking a performance advantage or to spend to solve issues with their cars. “It’s just another excuse to raise it again,” he said. “It’s probably 80% a smokescreen and 20% that they were unable to predict the inflation would be this big. “If everybody learns the cap is not going to be increased, they stop lobbying for it and they actually plan better.” Significantly McLaren and Aston Martin, previously strong backers of the budget cap, are understood to now support raising it, but both have underperforming cars this season. Alpine, by contrast, are in fifth place in the championship with a solid car that has considerable potential. Szafnauer believes it would be fundamentally unfair to punish teams who have ensured they are within the rules. “We planned for this and made decisions that are irreversible,” he said. “We have done a good job, so I can’t support increasing the cap because others haven’t. It would definitely tilt the playing field and favour those who took risks we didn’t take.” Haas and Alfa Romeo are also understood to oppose the change, both teams with cars that have been impressive in the opening rounds. The issue will likely be discussed at a meeting of the F1 commission on 26 April. To change the regulations would require a supermajority of eight of the 10 teams. Ferrari, meanwhile, have extended their contract with driver Carlos Sainz to the end of 2024, the team announced in Imola. The Spaniard is currently third in the championship.",Sport/Sport,"Raising F1 budget cap would ‘tilt playing field’, claims Alpine team chief",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/21/raising-f1-budget-cap-would-tilt-the-playing-field-claims-szafnauer
4/22/2022,"My sister, Gillian Brown, who has died aged 77 of ovarian cancer, was a teacher of children with emotional and behavioural problems. She was dedicated to this challenging work and to spreading the power of education. Gillian was born in Leeds to Mary (nee Harrison) and Graham Myatt, both of whom had been the first in their families to attend secondary school and went on to become teachers. They valued education highly. Gill went to the local girls’ grammar, Allerton high school, where she was a keen student, particularly of history and English literature. She trained for teaching at Didsbury College (now Manchester Metropolitan University), qualifying in 1966. Her first job was at Boothstown Methodist primary school in Worsley. In the late 70s she moved to Homelea, in Boothstown, a special school for children with behavioural and emotional problems, some of whom were in care. She worked there till the early 1990s, teaching home economics and textiles as well as literacy and numeracy to mixed-age classes. Gill met Adrian Brown in the late 1970s. They married in 1980 and had three children. At home, Gill was a tremendous role model: a beautiful and intelligent woman with a professional career, who provided for the family on equal terms with her husband so that gender inequality was alien to her children. She strongly encouraged her children to make the most of their education. After she retired, Gill worked as a relief teacher across the Greater Manchester area. In the late 1990s she took on the main burden of supporting our increasingly frail parents. Then, from 2008 until 2013, Gill helped to look after her two grandsons when her elder daughter followed her mother into teaching. Though a reserved person, Gill was warm and funny. She entertained us with her rapid-fire one-liners, delivered deadpan. A shrewd observer of the world and its ways, she was an avid reader, particularly of fiction, her house a treasure trove of books. She loved walking, visiting museums and touring stately homes. She dressed with style and was a skilful tailor: she sewed dresses, jackets, curtains and wonderful patchwork quilts. She loved crosswords, the Guardian and Radio 4. Adrian died in 2005.

4/22/2022,"An auction of artwork, including pieces by Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol, and other personal items owned by the late supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is expected to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars next week. Much of her collection of paintings and ceramics forms a 115-lot modern art auction hosted by the Potomack company of Alexandria, Virginia, in an online catalog. An additional collection entitled “chambers and home” features 145 more lots of miscellaneous curios, including pewter bowls, crystal vases and numerous other personal items. Ginsburg, the iconic human and civil rights pioneer who died in 2020 aged 87 from complications of pancreatic cancer, owned a multitude of artefacts spanning the last two centuries, by artists including Picasso and Warhol. One of the most valuable items is a 1953 oil painting, Presagio-Premonition, by the Mexican artist Gunther Gerzso, which is expected to raise up to $100,000. Among the most personal is a “Gartenhaus natural black mink coat” with Ginsburg’s name embroidered in a pocket. By Thursday morning, bidding for that was already above $2,000, more than twice its original estimate. Ceramics by Picasso, and a Warhol painting of a can of tomato soup, are among the other highlights. “These items are truly tangible pieces of her life and times as one of America’s greatest supreme court justices,’’ Elizabeth Haynie Wainstein, owner of the Potomack Company, told the New York Times. “These items would be of interest to all Americans who admired Justice Ginsburg as a civil rights pioneer and defender of equality for all Americans.” Proceeds for the two auctions, which end respectively on 27 and 28 April, will benefit the Washington National Opera, of which Ginsburg was a keen supporter and frequent attendee. In addition, Potomack said it would donate 10% of its commission to help fund fellowships for the Women of Berkeley Law, a student group at the University of California whose law school has produced many trailblazing female legal figures. Ginsburg, nicknamed “the notorious RBG”, was noted for her advocacy for women’s rights, and the auction is the latest acknowledgment of her importance to the civil and human rights movements. Last month, the US navy announced it was naming a ship in her honor. In March, the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History said it would display, among other items, her famous “dissent collar” which, according to the New York Times, was “the one she wore on days that she gave powerful and pointed opinions at odds with the Supreme Court’s majority”.",News/US news,Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s personal art collection up for auction,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/21/ruth-bader-ginsburg-art-collection-auction
4/22/2022,"Trevor Noah discussed troubling numbers for Netflix on Wednesday evening, after the company announced it had lost 200,000 subscribers in the first three months of this year and expects to lose 2 million more over the next quarter. The news, which sent the company’s stock tumbling 35%, is “so surprising, because me and the 43 people I share my account with, we’re still watching it all the time”, the Daily Show host quipped. As its stock plummets, Netflix execs are considering an array of options, meaning they’ll probably scroll around for 45 minutes and just put on Seinfeld. pic.twitter.com/PwvdOpFDaY “You know how you know Netflix is in trouble? It’s because they’re even considering ads,” he added on the company’s plan to introduce a cheaper, ad-supported subscription plan. “You realize for years, Netflix has hated ads,” he said. “They treated ads the way French people treat everything.” The decline in subscribers stems from a number of factors, including password sharing, inflation and “Regé Jean-Page leaving Bridgerton”, said Noah. “Now Netflix executives are being forced to consider multiple options. Only problem is, knowing Netflix, they’re just going to scroll through those options for like 45 minutes before they give up and just put on Seinfeld.” But there’s “no reason to panic” said Noah, as “this was always bound to happen” with the rise of competitive streaming services such as HBO Max and Peacock. “The king of streaming is struggling right now,” he concluded. “And I hope that they make it through, I honestly do. I like Netflix. Because without Netflix, there’s no Netflix and chill. And that would be a disaster. We need the pretense of watching Netflix for six minutes before we start the sex.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert observed 4/20, the national holiday for potheads. “Time for all you doobie-loving potheads to get up to your usual smoky hijinks: folding laundry and hoping half a gummy will help you fall asleep,” he quipped. New polling says that 37% of Americans use weed – “while the remaining 63% say they were just holding it for a friend”, Colbert joked – and two-thirds of Americans also say they want recreational marijuana use to be legal under federal law and in their own state. “Well, that makes sense,” said Colbert. “Marijuana is tame compared other controlled substances. Its most dangerous side-effect is making hacky sack seem like a sport.” “As we have said many times on this show, the modern Republican party is, among many other things, a collection of some of the weirdest people in the world,” said Seth Meyers on Wednesday’s Late Night. “There’s just no other way to say it. They just constantly say and do weird shit.” Meyers pointed to when Representative Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina claimed on a podcast that his GOP colleagues held cocaine-fueled orgies, Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s promoting testicle tanning, and Texas senator Ted Cruz “whining” about Disney’s criticism of Florida’s so-called “don’t say gay” law. On Monday, Cruz said of Disney, which opposed the law that bans public school teachers from discussing sexual orientation or gender identity before third grade: “I think there are people who are misguided trying to drive Disney stepping in saying, in every episode now they’re going to have you know Mickey and Pluto going at it. Really? … These are kids. You can always shift to Cinemax if you want that.” “You can? Which Cinemax package do you have?” Meyers mocked. “Just remember: anytime you come up with some kinky idea involving two cartoon characters, pornography has beat you to it. I bet if you googled Mickey and Pluto the top auto-complete options would be ‘go on a picnic’, ‘go on a drive’ and ‘go to town on each other’.” “Ted Cruz jumping to that conclusion makes it clear that he already has some pretty pervy ideas about the Magic Kingdom,” he added. “I’d hate to hear why he thinks it’s called Splash Mountain.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also celebrated 4/20 with a CBS News poll that found that 66% of Americans want marijuana to be legal under federal law. “Sixty-six per cent of Americans don’t agree on anything,” said Kimmel. “We can barely get 66% of Americans to agree that horse medicine is for horses. That’s a lot of people.” And the fallout from the Oscars slap is still rippling through show business, as producers of the Tony awards sent a letter to prospective audience members announcing a “strict no violence policy”. “In the event of an incident,” the letter continued, “the perpetrator will be removed from the event immediately”. “Not only will the perpetrator be removed from the theater, they will be banned from the Tony awards for 525,600 minutes,” Kimmel joked, singing the signature Rent tune. “I think this is good, because I’m going to tell you something: I know we laugh but the only thing worse than getting slapped is getting slapped with jazz hands.”",Arts/Culture,"Trevor Noah: ‘Without Netflix, there’s no Netflix and chill’",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/21/trevor-noah-late-night-netflix
4/22/2022,"Here is the sure sign of a government in a death spiral, devoid of ideas, plans or solutions. Can they really stand by and do next to nothing while shocking energy bills land this month? Already the poorest people on expensive prepay meters find their electricity running out at the speed of light. If it’s bad now, “a truly horrific winter” lies ahead, warned energy companies in parliament this week. Bills will shoot up again in October, just as people turn up their heating. The government’s response has been nugatory, its mean mitigations mostly in loans that only stoke future problems for households: high energy prices are not set to be a brief spike. When energy companies warn that some 40% of households will fall into fuel poverty, with thousands telling them already about their inability to pay, inaction is not an option. Food banks are already overwhelmed, with long queues for the most basic of supplies. Laissez-faire is unthinkable. There are solutions, short and long term. Here is a particularly imaginative one, from Fuel Poverty Action, which would reverse the perversities in current pricing. Give everyone a minimum quantity of free energy, enough to just about manage frugally in a small home. Then raise the tariff on a steep gradient for all extra energy used, so big properties and heavy users pay higher and higher rates the more they use, covering the cost of the free energy. The incentive for everyone would be to cut back as much as they could, so high-earners who never bothered about it before would find energy extravagance exorbitant. They too would soon be turning off lights and devices on standby, using less water (energy intensive) and wearing more vests and jumpers. The present system does the opposite. With standing charges, the lowest users pay the highest rates, those with prepay meters pay monstrous rates, and it tails off for high users the more they use. This basic good idea can be adjusted in all kinds of ways: older people, and those who are sick or frail and have to stay home all day, would need extra allowances, extending the present warm homes discount scheme. The winter fuel allowance would be abandoned. I never thought dishing out cash according to age, regardless of income, was a wise distribution of funds. Other adjustments might be for most people to pay a little towards the first tranche of energy rather making it free, if that quells Tory instincts. It could be means-tested from the start. But a free first tranche is far more appealing, with a stronger incentive for more households to try to keep within its free ration. The vital point is to end the topsy-turvy nature of the current system, to charge those who can afford it more, encouraging everyone to use less. Diane Skidmore, a 71-year-old woman living in a cold Lambeth council flat, is an activist with Fuel Poverty Action, and has started a petition to Boris Johnson to bring in this #EnergyForAll system. She is stunned by the shock effect of the energy price rise on neighbours in her block. “They can’t believe what’s happening to them, as their prepay meters keep running out,” she tells me. In her petition, she writes: “I am asthmatic, and many of us have health problems, as well as problems with our housing conditions … There are too many people who cannot afford or struggle to keep warm.” Her petition points out that even before the pandemic and Ukraine-related price rises, the “excess deaths” each winter due to cold were high: according to the Office for National Statistics, there were 23,670 excess deaths in the winter of 2018-2019. The numbers signing up to her petition are pouring in. Her plan is, of course, redistribution, like a basic income but for basic energy. No government will ever cover the entire cost of this energy price rise indefinitely, so one way or another, the unbearable cost has to be carried by the broadest shoulders. It’s better to do it by making everyone keenly aware of their own energy use than through subsidies paid from general taxes. As the End Fuel Poverty coalition of environment and poverty charities points out, other energy saving has been all but abandoned. Ever since David Cameron flippantly cut “the green crap” and stripped out green subsidies on insulation, the number of homes getting loft or cavity wall insulation plummeted by 92% and 74% respectively. The government has rejected Labour’s proposed windfall tax on soaring, unexpected energy profits: as Keir Starmer told the Commons, BP made £9.5bn and Shell £14bn, while the National Audit Office shows in some years the government paid more to oil and gas companies in tax relief than it received from them in taxes. The recent white paper offered no new immediate help with bills nor any progress on energy efficiency, and only weak aspirations on renewable energy supplies, rejecting onshore wind. The New Economics Foundation welcomes Labour’s support for its Great Homes Upgrade, pledging to insulate 19m homes by 2030, the best possible “levelling up”. Insulation means training large numbers of people in jobs retrofitting Britain’s cold, damp housing, with the most deprived areas needing it most. Boris Johnson still has no roadmap to his 2050 zero-carbon pledge. Would he take up Diane Skidmore’s plan? I’m afraid pigs and flying comes to mind.

4/22/2022,"My grandfather Abraham Yoffe, who has died aged 102, was an explosives expert, a research physicist at Cambridge University’s Cavendish laboratory, and a founding fellow of Darwin College, Cambridge. Abe was born in Jerusalem to Haim Yoffe, a rabbi, and his wife, Leah (nee Kreindal). He lived in Australia as a child, attending Melbourne high school. He studied chemistry at the University of Melbourne, graduating in 1941, and stayed for a master’s. In 1942, Abe joined the Australian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to investigate the causes of unpredicted explosions, which could completely destroy explosives factories. Within a remarkably short period, Abe and his colleagues showed that, if tiny bubbles were present in liquid nitroglycerine, its sensitivity to mechanical impact increased, leading to greater risk of explosion. In 1944, he moved to Cambridge, where he completed his PhD in 1948. Following three years as a senior scientist in physical chemistry at the Weizmann Institute in Israel, Abe returned to Cambridge, and in 1958 was appointed assistant director of research of the physics and chemistry of solids group (PCS), part of the Cavendish laboratory. In 1961 he became a doctor of science and in 1968 he was appointed to a readership in physics. In 1964, when Darwin College was founded, Abe became one of the first 12 fellows, and he remained a fellow for 58 years, contributing to the welfare of the college by attracting many talented postgraduates, research fellows and scientists of international reputation. Abe was appointed head of PCS in 1981 until his retirement in 1987. He then became a member of the optoelectronics group, researching the physics of quantum confined materials. After retiring he enjoyed skiing – an interest of his since the 1940s – and tennis. He loved football and spent many happy days watching Cambridge City, Cambridge United and occasionally Tottenham Hotspur. He also loved cycling around Cambridge and over the fens to Ely. Abe married Elizabeth Mann in 1949. She died in 2014. He is survived by their children Deborah, Gideon and Susan, his 13 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren. Another son, Jonathon (Jay), died in 1988.",News/Education,Abraham Yoffe obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/21/abraham-yoffe-obituary
