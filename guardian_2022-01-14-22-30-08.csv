1/14/2022,"For over 30 years, Sharleen Spiteri’s carefree and soulful voice has lit up a string of radio-friendly hits both solo and as the frontwoman of Texas, who are heading back out on tour this month – and before they begin, she will answer Guardian readers’ questions on her life and career. Before selling tens of millions of albums, Spiteri grew up in suburban Glasgow and worked as a hairdresser, forming Texas in 1987. Their debut single I Don’t Want a Lover went Top 10 in the UK and charted in the US, with its appealing combination of slick soft rock and Spiteri’s country-ish vocal melody.  Their success waned a little in the early 90s but they built towards their biggest hit, the 1997 album White on Blonde, which went six times platinum in the UK. The band’s versatility became their strength as they wrote a variety of defining songs: Say What You Want nodded to the moodiness of trip-hop, Halo channelled the grandeur of late-period Britpop and Black Eyed Boy resurrected the sound of northern soul. The Hush album in 1999 was equally massive, reaching No 1 and spending over a year in the chart. They were never exactly cool, but Texas were arguably more adventurous than some of their supposedly edgier peers – their version of Say What You Want with the Wu-Tang Clan, memorably performed at the Brit awards with real chemistry between Spiteri and Method Man, was a seamless and inspired mash-up. “We’ve never really followed any trends. We’ve just always tried to make relevant records, sometimes we have gotten it very right and sometimes we have got it very wrong,” Spiteri said last year. She went solo after 2005’s Red Book – having turned down a part in Baz Luhrmann’s musical Moulin Rouge – and her debut album Melody spent five weeks in the Top 10. Texas returned in 2013, and have retained a sizeable chunk of their peak 90s fanbase: 2021 album Hi, which reconnected them with the Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA for the title track, was another Top 3 hit. It’s a remarkably enduring and multifaceted career, and next week Spiteri will answer questions on it. Post them in the comments below by 11am on Tuesday 18 January. Her answers will be published in the 21 January edition of the Film & Music section, and online.",Arts/Music,Post your questions for Sharleen Spiteri of Texas,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/14/post-your-questions-for-sharleen-spiteri-of-texas
1/14/2022,"A handful of monitors to measure air quality in the classrooms of a large Midlands secondary school was nowhere near enough to go round, but sufficient to detect a problem. “Readings in some rooms were well over the suggested clean air limit of 800ppm,” said one teacher. “We asked for action to be taken but nothing was done and now the monitors have been taken away.” The teacher is not alone in his concern over poor air quality, which increases the risk of Covid infection, in schools. Aware of the link, the government sent out to schools in England 350,000 monitors to check the quantity of CO2 in the air, measured in ppm (parts per million), mainly from exhaled breath. But it is providing only 8,000 air purifiers for classrooms.  Now a survey by the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) suggests that the Department for Education may have underestimated the demand. Of the nine in 10 schools that received the monitors, more than a third – 34% – found classrooms with consistently poor levels of ventilation, the survey found. Of those, more than half – 53% – said even after taking action they continued to have rooms with a red reading, denoting consistently poor air quality. It also showed that only a tiny 2% of schools are using air filters and cleaning devices provided by the government. A further 8% are using ones they bought themselves. Three-quarters of the 1,625 schools in the survey said they could not afford such devices – the government recommends two filters suitable for a classroom, priced at £425 or £1,170 a unit, plus the cost of filters. Paul Whiteman, the NAHT’s general secretary, says the survey suggests 8,000 air filters are unlikely to satisfy demand from the more than a quarter of a million classrooms in England. “We will encourage government to monitor demand and to make more available as required, to ensure all schools that need one, get one. Adequate ventilation in classrooms should not be limited to first come, first served,” he said. Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, told the Commons this month that “the majority of schools didn’t report any issues with the atmosphere in the classroom”. The government had ordered 8,000 purifiers because the feedback suggested that was all that was needed. To provide them for all schools would be a waste of taxpayers’ money, he said. However, Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrat education spokesperson, says schools are missing out because the DfE has set the bar too high. Only those with rooms consistently above 1500 ppm of CO2 could get free filters, nearly twice 800 ppm, the widely agreed safe level. “The government has completely failed teachers, pupils and parents alike with their botched air purifier scheme,” she said. “Not only do their own criteria fail to keep most classrooms safe, the earliest a school can access equipment is next month. This snail’s pace is frankly unacceptable.” “Conservative ministers are spending twice as much on a royal yacht than it would cost to provide an air purifier for every classroom,” she added. “They are making schools compete for equipment to help keep their pupils and staff members safe.” In Bradford a study of air quality in 30 primary schools is seeking to identify the most efficient way of achieving clean air in the classroom and the link between CO2 levels and Covid transmission rates. One group in the study uses the conventional method of opening windows, the next also uses air filters and the third group has ultra-violet lamps that kill the virus. Catherine Noakes, professor of environmental engineering at the University of Leeds, one of the researchers, says 800 ppm or 1500 ppm should not be seen as hard measures. “If your levels are 800 or below then that’s healthy and you don’t need to do anything. If levels are routinely above 1500 ppm then your ventilation is poor, you have a problem and you need to do something about it,” she says. “Between 800 and 1500 a lot of other factors have to be taken into account. You could get a school routinely getting 900 because of variations caused, for example, by the position of the sensors, or the number of people in the room.” The Department for Education said its statistics showed 99% of state-funded education settings had received a CO2 monitor. A spokesperson added: “Air cleaning units are not needed in the vast majority of classrooms – only where there is poor ventilation that cannot be easily improved. Based on feedback from schools that there are only a small number of cases where good ventilation is not possible, we are supplying up to 8,000 air cleaning units from next week.” Schools, nurseries and colleges have until 17 January to apply for 7,000 of the air cleaning units. Special schools and alternative provision settings have already been offered 1,000 units. “Together with mass testing, bringing in supply staff and the hard work of schools and teachers, we are confident that our measures will maximise classroom time for students,” the spokesperson said.",News/Education,Schools in England say government not providing enough air purifiers,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/14/schools-england-demand-air-purifiers-being-underestimated
1/14/2022,"He left the meeting in a right old huff, chuntering that it was a bad day for farming and dismissing one of the planning officials as a comedian, after his scheme to build a hilltop restaurant on his Oxfordshire farm was flatly turned down. But Jeremy Clarkson, petrolhead turned farming reality TV show star, may be heartened by the concern and interest in his case that rippled through the Cotswolds this week.  Fellow farmers, other food producers and local residents, even some who really don’t like Clarkson’s take-no-prisoners style, argued that the case illustrated a disconnect between planners and the needs of modern farmers to find new, imaginative ways of making a living. “It’s a real shame,” said Pete Ledbury, who farms with his wife, Emma, at the North Cotswolds Dairy just a few miles from Clarkson’s Diddly Squat farm. “We know that we have to diversify to make a living and create more jobs for the countryside. Turning down projects like this doesn’t help. I think it’s pretty shortsighted of the planners.” Emma Ledbury spelled out the pressure that farms such as theirs were under. In recent years they have lost 40 of their 100-strong herd of pedigree holstein cattle to bovine tuberculosis, drastically cutting their chances of turning a profit. It costs 32p to produce a litre of milk, for which supermarket buyers have been paying them about 28p. Selling milk directly to the customer via a vending machine at the Diddly Squat farm shop for a fairer price has helped keep them going and they were hoping to provide milk, cream and butter to the restaurant. Those hopes appear to have been dashed. “British farming is in a mess,” she said. Clarkson argued at a West Oxfordshire district council planning meeting that his restaurant, which he wanted to open in a converted lambing shed, was the sort of diversification project farmers needed to undertake to survive. His scheme, the meeting was told, would create jobs for up to 25 people and give local farmers and other food producers a more lucrative market for their goods than the supermarkets. It would also shorten the supply chain and reduce food miles. Clarkson’s business plan for the restaurant revealed that government subsidy accounts for more than 85% of his farm’s profit but the basic payment scheme income – the current main financial support system for farming – is to reduce from £83,000 a year to zero by 2028. The planning subcommittee rejected the restaurant after hearing complaints that the popularity of the TV star’s Amazon Prime show Clarkson’s Farm had caused traffic chaos as fans flocked to his farm shop – and being advised by officials that its prominent position in an area of outstanding natural beauty (AONB) meant it should be turned down. Max Abbott, who owns the bakery Sourdough Revolution in Lechlade and had hoped to supply bread to the restaurant, was furious. “There’s a huge drive to allow farms to diversify, to attract more people, more money and break down the gap between farm and plate,” he said. “Jeremy is employing people, bringing in money. He’s not everyone’s cup of tea but what the council is doing seems absurd.” In the village of Chadlington, just down the hill from the farm, there are plenty of people fed up with the disruption that Clarkson’s shop has caused and are dead set against the restaurant. But many others, such as Victoria Steffens, who works in a village shop, said it was mainly newcomers who were against the restaurant scheme. “The locals, the people who have been here a long time, realise that businesses that provide new jobs have to be a good thing. Jeremy Clarkson is Marmite but I’m backing him.” Merilyn Davies, a district councillor and one of only two committee members who supported the restaurant plan, added: “I never thought I’d agree with Jeremy Clarkson. He rubs some people up the wrong way but I think his idea of local farmers working as a cooperative to supply the restaurant was interesting. We have to give the AONB weight but it’s not all about bats and newts. We have to remember people live here too.” While there are many very rich people who live in the area, Davies said there were pockets of deprivation and people had to leave for Oxford, Abingdon or further afield to find work. “Farming is an important part of rural Britain. If we want it to be part of our future, we have to be creative.” Like him or loathe him, Clarkson’s televised farming – and planning – adventures are putting the microscope on rural issues. Back at the North Cotswolds Dairy, Pete Ledbury said the show and the planning application had shown at least one thing: “Food is hard to produce and it pays bugger all.”",News/Media,‘It’s shortsighted’: farmers lament veto of Jeremy Clarkson restaurant,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/14/its-shortsighted-farmers-lament-veto-of-jeremy-clarkson-restaurant
1/14/2022,"It’s time to downsize your finances. I mean a permanent cutback, not just a post-Christmas squeeze. But this isn’t about tightening your belt; it is about shrinking your wallet. These days, my wallet is more of a wallette. It is a glorified cardholder, really: just bigger than a credit card, with slots for swipecards and driving licence and the few store cards and membership cards that haven’t yet migrated to my phone. There is a press-stud compartment for cash, although I use this infrequently. In lipstick-red grained calfskin leather, with gilt YSL lettering, my wallette still has an air of importance. But it is a shadow of its former incarnations.  By the time I got my wallet, its full-size predecessor was falling apart at the seams. I am not particularly thrifty, just too lazy to faff about with the tiresome mini-admin task of figuring out what to do with the flotsam and jetsam of receipts and loyalty cards that had accumulated. What tipped me over the edge to deciding it was time for a new purse wasn’t the scuff marks, but the fact that the wallet had become too big. Big enough to fill an entire jeans back pocket, it was an unwieldy relic, like carting around a brick-size phone. My wallette is small enough to slip into a front jeans pocket. I can take it out in an evening bag, instead of having to decant a debit card and an emergency £20, like I did in the big-wallet days. And it’s not just me. The baby wallet is big news. For Christmas gifts, Zara did brisk business with a £59.99 boxed set of matching leather gloves and mini-wallet. At Matchesfashion, sales of cardholders were up 117% on last year in the run-up to Christmas. Bestselling at Marks & Spencer right now is a diminutive mock-croc cardholder with a starburst snap closure for £9.50. At Selfridges, the mini-wallet range has grown by a third: it reports that Le Porte, a unisex Jacquemus mini-wallet with a strap so that you can wear it cross-body, or lanyard-style around your neck, is a bestseller at £240. At Mulberry, where wallets used to tend toward the size of a chequebook (remember those?), demand has also shifted towards the dinky. Its folded multi-card wallet, a palm-sized 8 x 11.5cm, is a hit, and slim cardholders are popular with those who have completely given up on coins. I have predicted the death of the wallet before. Seven years ago, in fact. I’m not saying this to show off, though, because reading that article back, I realise I got it completely wrong. My outlandish prediction back then seems to have been that the chunky wallet would eventually die off with generation X, since millennials preferred smaller wallets and were daringly experimenting with the concept of paying for sandwiches and train tickets using their smartphones. At that point, it didn’t seem to have crossed my mind that cash would be close to obsolete so soon. For that I can blame the pandemic-hastened demise of cash, and with it the wallet, not just because of the practicalities – dirty notes and all that – but because it showed us that even ingrained habits can change – fast. The rise of the mini-wallet is driven by utility, but is symbolic, too. A fat wallet is no longer a status symbol – not now contactless stealth wealth has come to the masses. A fat wallet once made you look rich; now, it looks like you need to save up for a wallette.",Lifestyle/Fashion,"Crash, bang, wallet: why downsizing your card-carrier is a great idea | Jess Cartner-Morley",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/14/bye-bye-big-wallets-why-its-time-to-downsize-your-purse
1/14/2022,"Cryptocurrency firms bombarded Londoners with a record number of adverts on public transport during 2021, fuelling calls for a ban to prevent people being lured into risky investments. The surge in adverts for crypto assets, which are unregulated in the UK, has prompted concerns about the risk of addiction and financial harm, particularly given the wild volatility in the price of digital currencies such as bitcoin, which reached record highs last year before crashing again.  It also emerged that Transport for London (TfL) has not implemented a ban on gambling adverts promised by the mayor, Sadiq Khan, allowing the industry to step up its marketing activity in the meantime. Records obtained by the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act show that TfL services displayed 39,560 crypto adverts from 13 firms in the six months between April and September 2021. Major advertisers include the trading platform eToro, floki – “a “meme coin” named after Elon Musk’s dog – Crypto.com and Luno Money, whose campaign telling people it was “time to buy” bitcoin was banned by the advertising regulator for being “irresponsible”. The promotional drive eclipsed previous years, as advertisers tapped into the popularity of smartphone trading apps and increased awareness of digital currencies such as bitcoin and ether. In 2019, the only advertiser offering crypto services on TfL buses and trains was trading platform eToro, which paid for just five digital displays and 40 “supersides”, long posters on the side of doubledecker buses. Despite widespread working from home in 2020, the volume of crypto ads increased, with companies including Luno Money and Coinfloor buying 1,595 ads between them. Before the recent surge, 2018 was the busiest year for crypto ads on TfL since it started recording data in 2017. Even then, 15,000 were shown in 12 months, compared with 39,560 after just six months of 2021, including promotions for relatively obscure firms such as Hex, Kraken, BOTS, and Puglife. In total, crypto companies have spent £825,245 to advertise on TfL tube and train services since 2018. The organisation does not hold spending data for buses. A separate freedom of information request by the Guardian revealed that the crypto advertising push was mirrored by a significant increase in gambling ads, as Khan’s April 2021 promise to ban gambling ads appeared to stall. In 2018-19, online casinos and bookmakers spent £783,476 to advertise on TfL services, then £1m the following year, followed by £1.16m in 2020-21. But they spent £1.17m in the first three months of the 2021-22 period. While the Euros football championship likely to have fuelled the increase in part, spending was nearly six times higher than in 2018, the year of the last World Cup. Khan pledged to ban gambling ads in his manifesto, published nearly nine months ago, but a spokesperson for the Mayor’s office said it was yet to be enacted. Siân Berry, the Green party’s former co-leader, now its London Assembly member, urged Khan to move forward with the ban and extend it to crypto adverts. “Investment bubbles have always worked by dragging in more and more inexperienced suckers towards the end of the cycle. That’s the stage at which some of these projects may be at with all this public advertising,” she said. “The risk is that they draw in people who are more likely than not to lose money, which is closely equivalent to gambling and I think these promotions should be banned by Transport for London in the same way.” “People are struggling at the moment and they may have had blows to their life chances. They may have lost livelihoods or homes and be susceptible to get-rich-quick schemes.” “Are TfL doing proper checks to establish whether these are legitimate companies?” A TfL spokesperson said all adverts contained a disclaimer stating that crypto is unregulated in the UK and that the value of investments could fall. The transport body is vetting ads before they run and is understood to be refusing any that use similar language to those that have been banned or investigated by the ASA. It has written to both the FCA and ASA seeking further guidance. The managing director of eToro UK, Dan Moczulski, said: “eToro fully supports measures, including regulation, designed to protect and educate investors about crypto and other financial asset classes.” Asked about the concerns raised about their advertising, several of the crypto firms responded, saying any dangers were well flagged and not unique to crypto assets. Floki, one of whose adverts is being investigated by the ASA, said banning crypto ads would be “censorship” and that ads should be regulated and include disclaimers. It also said crypto was “anything but a bubble” and would “change the world as we know it”. Kraken said bubbles “generally don’t last over a decade” with a high degree of adoption by institutions. BOTS said all investments came with risk and pointed out that the financial crisis of 2008 showed traditional finance wasn’t without dangers. Luno Money, whose bitcoin advert was banned by the ASA last year, said it would welcome “more formal guidance”, which it hoped would emerge this year.

1/14/2022,"By Christmas 1995, it was moderately common knowledge that a “sex tape” existed of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee, privately filmed on their honeymoon that year, after a whirlwind 96-hour romance. As the star of Baywatch, Anderson was so globally famous that other, also famous TV shows had storylines about her. Lee, the Mötley Crüe drummer, was also extremely well known, mainly as a sex, drugs and rock’n’roll poster boy, partly for mooning whenever he went on stage. Their union, and its impact, was a molecular chemistry kind of affair; like oxygen and hydrogen, each, alone, was a powerful element, but combined they were altogether more culturally powerful – her eroticism slightly neutralised by marriage, his trouble-seeking rendered a bit safer beside her all-American (actually Canadian) smile.  Let me unpack that a bit: it was the 90s. Women, even if they were gay, and definitely not if they weren’t, didn’t ogle or sanction the ogling of other women’s breasts. Men who took drugs and had tattoos didn’t get asked to endorse sports brands. The highly anticipated forthcoming Disney+ bio-series, Pam & Tommy, shows Lee in a much more unflattering light than he was seen in his heyday, but he was never thought of as a peach. The show is a sumptuous affair, lingering on every luxurious detail of their Malibu mansion, Lee’s tattoos, Anderson’s cartoon beauty, but don’t mistake it for wealth porn (which is, of course, TV gold at the moment). His personality, her rather winning denial and inching disillusionment, tell a tense story. It’s ostensibly a caper about the sex tape and its fallout, but the simmering volatility – of Lee but also of almost everyone – creates a suspense deeper than the presence of all these celebrities would have you expect. The sex tape, plus a load of guns and jewellery, were stolen from Lee’s safe at home just before Halloween 1995. By Christmas, it was in a Daily Mail year-in-review round-up, so everyone knew about it, but nobody had seen it. Fair play – it wasn’t until 1996 that the couple even realised the tape was missing – but there was more going on. In ways that wouldn’t become clear until much later, this was a period of tectonic shifts: from old media to new; from old to new versions of celebrity, privacy, image and brand; and from old norms around sex, porn, exhibitionism and voyeurism to new ones that still aren’t settled. A lot of what used to make sex sleazy was in the detail. The lines between normal and kinky, clean and dirty, were drawn by the conventions of consumption; if this thing you were buying was nice, you’d be able to buy it in a nice place. Likewise, to watch this sex tape, you’d have had to send $59.95 to a Canadian T-shirt company in New York, who would then send you a VHS via Amsterdam. Or if you happened to be in the US, you’d have to know a guy who knew the guy who’d scammed the original thief, who would sell a copy straight into your hands for $175. None of this was the kind of thing respectable people did. You would look dim if you hadn’t heard about the sex tape, but to say you’d seen it, well, you’d at least need a reason. The same couldn’t be said of sex tapes that exploded five or 10 years later – Kim Kardashian’s was leaked in 2007, Paris Hilton’s in 2003. There are so many circumstances under which you might have seen those: someone could have ironically linked to them on a chat forum, or you were just browsing. The point is, you wouldn’t need a reason. You could buy anything, anywhere, and often not even for money. In sex terms, the fundamental collapse brought about by the internet age isn’t so much of privacy or the right to be forgotten (as EU law has it), but in a shared consensus around what sexual decency actually is, who’s allowed to have it, who’s allowed to watch it, who’s exploited by it, who’s enjoying it. The truly amazing thing is how many years have passed without bringing us any closer to a new resolution. The Pam and Tommy story is astonishing in part because of their naivety. The series, starring Lily James and Sebastian Stan, is based on a 2014 Rolling Stone article, Pam and Tommy: The Untold Story of the World’s Most Infamous Sex Tape, which that details how, once they discovered the tape was missing, they sought to contain the leak. They sent heavies round to harass people they suspected of the theft and brought doomed lawsuits against distributors, as if the old rules were still in place and nobody could distribute your film unless you’d signed a release form. This isn’t a dumb-celeb story; their naivety was echoed across culture, subculture and the law – a sincere belief even among pornographers that if you hadn’t signed off on a film, you could prevent it from being seen. It was a first-world problem, sure, but there was genuine crisis in the years that followed about the value of celebrity: if you couldn’t control your own content, you couldn’t monetise it, and if you couldn’t monetise it, what actually was it? Enter Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, with a thought experiment. They didn’t personally release their tapes, and threatened lawsuits to prevent distribution, but both ultimately went on to profit from the notoriety, having understood that the rules had permanently changed. If you don’t own the content but still own the identity, flip the equation, so the content is not rationed and the identity becomes obliteratingly large: rather than guard your privacy, show everything. The funny thing about those sex tapes is that they don’t really work as pornography – Hilton’s is very fey, Kardashian’s is all random camera angles. But they’re not supposed to; they’re not really about sex but the body as a means of production: what can it sell? There was considerable debate in the early 00s around whether Hilton and Kardashian were the puppets or puppet-masters of the new age: in retrospect, I think it was misogynistic. If Mark Zuckerberg had done it, nobody would have asked if someone else were pulling his strings; though arguably, there would have been no mileage in him being naked. So there’s that. Anderson and Lee’s video had a distinctive mood, in that it felt private; it was made by two people, for each other, in an age in which mass accidental distribution wasn’t on the horizon. Later, when sex tapes became more common, the question was always whether they’d been released cynically by the subject or somehow finagled by dishonest means. There was a manosphere subset who were always questing after the original Anderson/Lee experience, who didn’t want to be consumers but peeping toms. When the great nude-dumps of the 10s came along, first in Celebgate in 2014, then in the Fappening of 2017, it was no accident they were posted on 4chan, image board of choice for the incel and other far-right misogynist movements. These were naked pictures, mostly of female actors, obtained without consent via a breach of iCloud security, and the point was that they were of stars you wouldn’t typically see naked: Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton. Many of the women depicted denied the authenticity of the images. The whole business was about more than naked bodies – which, let’s face it, by the middle of the last decade, you could find anywhere – it was about sticking it to women who wouldn’t put out. The Fappening was basically a metaphor for the incel identity; men who experience sex not as participants but as thieving observers, despised, marginal, illegitimate. Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee had two sons before divorcing in 1998. A detail that reads like a pub-quiz curiosity is that Anderson went on to marry Rick Salomon – the other party in the Paris Hilton sex video – in 2007. They got an annulment a year later, but remarried in 2014, divorcing again the year after that. (Arguably, Anderson is just very into nuptials; she managed a marriage, an annulment and another marriage to someone different during 2020, which I think puts your sourdough successes to shame.) Regarding her and Salomon, though, it seems likely their sex tapes were an absolutely seismic, defining event for both of them, which gave them a huge amount in common. As interesting as it is, to watch privacy mutate into exposure, self into image into brand, sex into advertorial, it is monumentally asymmetrical: to the many, a curiosity; to two people, essentially the rest of their lives. It’s a reparation the world wide web will never be able to make: to rectify or even acknowledge the scale of that impact, when a billion eyes all turn to glance at the same thing at once.

1/14/2022,"As legend goes, tossing a coin into the Trevi fountain guarantees a return visit to Rome. When, as a 16-year-old American tourist, Rita Carpenter participated in the ritual and made a wish to one day marry a Roman and live in the Italian capital, little did she know that almost five decades on she would return to marry a prince and home would be a 16th-century villa stuffed with history, including the only ceiling mural ever painted by Caravaggio. But now Princess Rita Boncompagni Ludovisi is facing the prospect of having to move out of the sprawling Villa Aurora, and the vast treasures it contains are at risk of being closed off to the public.  On 18 January the property goes under the hammer, amid a bitter inheritance feud with the sons of her late husband, Prince Nicolò Boncompagni Ludovisi. Hidden by high walls close to Via Veneto in central Rome, the villa is being sold with an opening bid of €471m (£393m), which would make it one of the world’s most expensive homes. “We couldn’t reach an agreement so the judge ruled it had to be auctioned,” said the 73-year-old. “I really haven’t slept much at all.” The princess is sceptical a petition launched this week urging the Italian government to stump up the cash to buy the property will be successful. Since the site is protected by the ministry of culture, once a bid has been agreed at auction the state will have the chance to buy the property at the same price. “I’d like the state to buy it but I don’t know if it’s a possibility as I don’t know if they have the money, that’s the problem. And I’m not the only heir.” The lion’s share of the asking price is attributed to Caravaggio’s Jupiter, Neptune and Pluto mural, which the artist painted in 1597 on the ceiling of a small room tucked away on the villa’s first floor. The 2.75-metre-wide mural was commissioned by the villa’s first owner, Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, to adorn the ceiling of his alchemy laboratory. But the Caravaggio is not the only slice of history that Villa Aurora’s new owner will acquire. The property lies on the site of what was once the home of Julius Caesar. Monuments in the front garden include a sculpture by Michelangelo. The building also contains ceilings frescoed by the baroque painter Guercino, who was commissioned by the Ludovisis, a noble family with close ties to the papacy who bought the property from Del Monte in 1621. The spiral staircase leading up to the Caravaggio and the three floors above was designed by the baroque architect Carlo Maderno, who also designed the facade of St Peter’s Basilica. The 40 or so rooms are packed with relics, including a door that belonged to an ancient Venetian warship, a telescope gifted to the Ludovosi family by Galileo Galilei and a leather box inscribed with a message from Queen Elizabeth II thanking the Ludovisi family for allowing members of the British Red Cross to reside in the villa for two years after the second world war. Villa Aurora has hosted everyone from Tchaikovsky and Henry James, who penned some of his 1909 classic, Italian Hours, in the villa’s garden, to Bette Midler and Madonna. “This really is a museum,” said Princess Rita. Villa Aurora was off the radar to the public until 2010, when it opened following a restoration project inspired by the princess after she saw it for the first time in 2003, the year she met Prince Nicolò. “It was abandoned, there were birds flying through it and I told Nicolò: ‘We have to open the villa, it has to be seen by Italians and other people, they need to understand the beauty and culture of it all,’” she said. Until the prince’s death in 2018, the villa hosted students of history and small private tour groups. The couple were also behind various charity initiatives. The princess put together a digital archive of 150,000 documents that shed even more light on the history of the villa. The princess had an intriguing life before she met Nicolò. Described by the Washington Post in 1978 as one of the four most dynamic young women in the city, she was married to the US congressman John Jenrette until their divorce in 1981 after his bribery conviction during the FBI’s Abscam investigation. She acted in several films and miniseries, studied at Harvard Business School, wrote three books and twice posed for Playboy magazine. She was a property broker in New York when she crossed paths with Nicolò. “He’d read an article about me in Crain’s Business, and then a mutual friend got in touch and said: ‘You must come to Rome, there’s this prince who wants to put a hotel on one of his properties outside the city.’” She was initially dismissive, but eventually flew to Rome and the pair instantly fell in love. A psychic had previously told her she would marry a European and live in Europe. “I’d kind of forgotten about it, but then there he was. He was a brilliant man in every way, and the least important part about him was being a prince.” In his will, Nicolò gave his wife the right to stay in the property for the rest of her life and, if sold, the proceeds were to be split between her and his sons. However, the sons disputed her right to stay in the villa, immediately prompting a toxic legal wrangle. She fears they will also try to prevent her getting her share of the sale’s proceeds. “They want the house to themselves, forgetting how kind I’ve been to them or that their father said I made him the happiest he had been in his life. I don’t know what I’ll do afterwards, but I’ve done all I can, I can’t fight any more.”",News/World news,The princess and the Caravaggio: bitter dispute rages over Roman villa,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/the-princess-and-the-caravaggio-bitter-dispute-rages-over-roman-villa
