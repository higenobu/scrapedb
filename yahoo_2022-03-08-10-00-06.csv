3/8/2022,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A Texas oil pipeline billionaire is suing Beto O'Rourke for defamation after the Democrat criticized his $1 million donation to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's campaign following last year's deadly winter blackout. O'Rourke, who won the Democratic nomination for governor last week, called the lawsuit frivolous during a news conference Monday. Court records show it was filed in February in rural West Texas. The donor, Kelcy Warren, is the chairman of Energy Transfer. The oil pipeline company reported $6.7 billion in net income last year, including about $2.4 billion in earnings related to the catastrophic February 2021 winter storm in Texas that sent natural gas prices soaring. Four months later, Warren gave the Abbott campaign $1 million, his largest single political contribution in a decade of donations to Republican candidates in Texas, according to state campaign finance records. O'Rourke has made the failure of Texas' power grid — and Abbott's handling of the aftermath — a cornerstone of his underdog campaign. He has accused the two-term governor of letting energy companies off the hook by not mandating more significant industry oversight or weatherization. O'Rourke has tweeted that energy executives “bought off” Abbott and at times has singled out Warren, saying during one campaign stop that the contribution “looks like a bribe to me.” The lawsuit filed in San Saba County seeks unspecified compensation. “O’Rourke intended that his malicious and baseless defamatory statements publicly humiliate Warren and discourage others from contributing to Governor Abbott’s campaign,” the lawsuit reads. Energy Transfer said in a statement that comments by O’Rourke are “flat-out false.” Renae Eze, a spokeswoman for Abbott, said their campaign “is in no way involved in this lawsuit.” Before last month's primary, O'Rourke spent two weeks highlighting the fallout from the winter storm in stops across Texas. He accused Warren of trying to shut him down. “We're on the most solid ground possible,” O'Rourke told reporters in Dallas.",Politics/Associated Press,Oil billionaire GOP donor sues Beto O'Rourke for defamation,https://news.yahoo.com/oil-billionaire-gop-donor-sues-232904838.html
3/8/2022,"By Andrew Chung and Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday let North Carolina and Pennsylvania use electoral maps approved by state courts to replace ones deemed to have given Republicans unfair advantages, improving Democratic chances of retaining control of the U.S. House of Representatives in November. The justices denied Republican requests to put on hold lower court rulings that adopted court-drawn boundaries for North Carolina's 14 House districts and Pennsylvania's 17 House districts to replace electoral maps devised by Republican-controlled legislatures in the two states. Republicans are seeking to regain control of the House, narrowly controlled by President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats, in the Nov. 8 midterm elections. Party primaries in Pennsylvania and North Carolina are set for May 17. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority. Conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented from the action concerning North Carolina. The North Carolina and Pennsylvania disputes are among the numerous court battles nationwide over the composition of electoral districts, which are redrawn each decade to reflect population changes measured in a national census, last taken in 2020. In most states, such redistricting is done by the party in power, which can lead to map manipulation for partisan gain. The Supreme Court in 2019 barred federal judges from curbing the practice, called partisan gerrymandering. LEGAL DOCTRINE The cases touch upon a once-marginal legal theory called the ""independent state legislature doctrine"" that is gaining traction in conservative legal circles and, if accepted, would vastly increase the power of politicians over elections. Under that doctrine, the U.S. Constitution gives legislatures, not state courts or other entities, authority over election rules including the drawing of electoral districts. The North Carolina Republican lawmakers challenging the court-drawn map placed the theory front and center, writing in a court filing: ""The North Carolina courts have usurped (the legislature's) constitutional authority."" Alito said the justices should have blocked the court-drawn map. ""This case presents an exceptionally important and recurring question of constitutional law, namely, the extent of a state court's authority to reject rules adopted by a state legislature for use in conducting federal elections,"" Alito wrote. The doctrine is based in part on language in the Constitution stating that the ""times, places and manner"" of federal elections ""shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof."" Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh indicated sympathy toward the views of the dissenters but said it was too close to the election to block the maps. But Kavanaugh added that the court should take up the underlying legal issue in due course. The opinions by Kavanaugh and Alito indicated that the court has the four votes needed to take up the doctrine and issue a ruling potentially limiting state court authority to review federal election rules set by state legislatures ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. It remains unclear if a majority of the justices would embrace such a ruling. ""Today's orders are temporary good news, but statements from four of the justices are ominous for the ability of state courts to uphold the right to vote under state constitutions,"" voting rights expert Josh Douglas of the University of Kentucky Rosenberg College of Law, wrote on Twitter. Bob Phillips, executive director of Common Cause North Carolina, a group defending the state's new districts, called Monday's action a victory. ""We're pleased that the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the legislative defendants' shameless attempt to impose their gerrymandered congressional map upon North Carolina,"" Phillips said. The North Carolina Supreme Court, acting after Democratic voters and an environmental group challenged the Republican-drawn map, struck it down, concluding it was intentionally biased against Democrats, diluting their ""fundamental right to equal voting power"" in violation of the state constitution's free elections and freedom of assembly provisions, among others. A lower state court then rejected a redrawn map submitted by the legislature, instead adopting a new map drawn by a bipartisan group of experts. According to some redistricting analysts, the court-approved map includes seven districts likely to favor Republicans, six likely to favor Democrats and one competitive seat. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Governor Tom Wolf vetoed a map approved by the legislature, saying the configuration of House districts gave Republicans an unfair advantage. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, acting on a lawsuit filed by Democratic voters, approved a new map that eliminated one Republican-leaning district approved by the legislature and, Republicans have argued, created a statewide map advantageous to Democrats.

3/8/2022,"No-nonsense White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday used “facts” to shoot down hectoring questions on mounting gasoline prices from Fox News reporter Peter Doocy. “I know that can be inconvenient,” she noted sarcastically. Doocy pressed her on fuel prices as he dismissed the widely held position that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has triggered the recent leap in costs — and instead blamed Biden administration policies. “There’s no question” the price hikes are a “direct result of the invasion of Ukraine,” Psaki responded. “Federal policies are not limiting the supplies of oil and gas,” she added. When Doocy interrupted her, Psaki fired back: “Peter, let me give you the facts here. I know that can be inconvenient, but I think they’re important in this moment.” Biden administration officials have been “clear” about the need for the U.S. oil supply to meet demand while also pushing for a shift to renewable energy sources, she said. Psaki pointed out that the U.S. is one of the world’s largest producers of oil and gas, noting that oil production in the nation is at “record numbers.” Meanwhile, there are “9,000 approved drilling permits that are not being used, so the suggestion that we are not allowing companies to drill is inaccurate,” Psaki added. “I would suggest you ask the oil companies why they’re not using those if there’s a desire to drill more.” Check out the Doocy exchange in the video clip up top.

""Not a word to anyone,"" Bronia, now 90, tells PEOPLE. ""I didn't think people would comprehend what happened."" She still didn't want to discuss it when she was being trained as a volunteer for the Museum of Jewish Heritage in Manhattan in 1996. But then a fellow volunteer spotted ""52643"" tattooed on her left forearm — the Nazis forced Jewish prisoners to get tattoos as a form of identification — ""and kept on bugging me to tell my story,"" she says. ""I said, 'Absolutely not.' But I was tired of her bothering me, so I took a tranquilizer and told my story to the group [at the museum]. They were amazed."" Since that day in 1996, the retired New York City school teacher has shared her story hundreds of times — in an HBO documentary, to school children who survived the Sandy Hook massacre and, most recently, during a 90-minute private chat with President Joe Biden in the Oval Office on Thursday, Jan. 27, International Holocaust Remembrance Day. ""He made us feel very comfortable,"" says Bronia. ""Very like friends to friends talking, and we were very impressed."" She's motivated to talk to bring attention to the recent surge in anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic violence, which she calls ""very scary."" She was ""horrified"" last week when Russian forces invading Ukraine bombarded the area near the Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, where the Nazis killed 34,000 Jews within 36 hours in 1941.

As a young girl, Bronia Rubin and her five siblings — the children of a hardware store owner — lived comfortably in Jaworzno, Poland. She was 8 when the Nazis invaded her town in 1939. The family fled to another town called Mielec but found no safety there. ""The Germans came in on the very first night. We heard horrible, scary voices screaming, 'They're Jews. Get out!'"" she recalls. ""They selected the men, marched them to the synagogue and burned them alive. ""And then they went to this house and butchered Jews and hung them on meat hooks,"" she continues. ""I learned what the Germans had in store."" Spared at that time, they eventually made it back to their hometown. Then her older brother, Mendek, was taken to a labor camp before the Nazis ordered all Jews in town to the school yard in August of 1942.

Some 1.3 million people — including 1.1 million Jews — were sent to Auschwitz, the largest of six Nazi concentration camps.

""Without thinking, in an instant, I didn't want to die, I ran to my sister's line,"" Bronia says. ""Nobody stopped me. But that meant that my two baby sisters were going to the gas chamber alone. That put my heart into stone."" Bronia and Mila were stripped naked and had their heads shaved and arms tattooed. Their hunger ""was indescribable"" and death always hovered.

At the end of World War II, as the Soviets were days away from arriving at Auschwitz to liberate the prisoners, Bronia was forced on a ""death march"" with nearly 60,000 others from the camp to Germany. Brozenka again saved her life. ""If you slow down, you were shot. I was slowing down,"" Bronia says. ""Bozenka grabbed me and carried me. Where did she get the strength? She risked her life again."" About 15,000 would die along the march. The pair stayed together in camps in Germany until the Allies liberated them in May of 1945. ""Where was I going to go, and to whom?"" says Bronia. ""Everybody was dead."" Courtesy of the White House  President Joe Biden and Bronia Brandman Bozenka stayed with Bronia, and the duo made their way to the nurse's family farm in Slovakia. ""She always treated me as if I was her child,"" says Bronia. (She kept in touch with Bozenka — who came to the U.S. in the 1970s — until her death a few years ago.) After a cousin found Bronia, she was reunited with her older brother, Mendek, who survived years in the labor camps. At 15, she came to the U.S. and settled in Borough Park, Brooklyn, where she's lived ever since.

After earning her degree at Brooklyn College and a master's in teaching at Adelphi, she taught English as a Second Language in New York City schools until retiring in 1996. Throughout all these years since the Nazis killed most of her family — the only survivors were Bronia and her brother — the trauma of the Holocaust has left her unable to cry.

3/8/2022,"KYIV, Ukraine — With hands still dirty from the battlefield, a dozen Russian prisoners of war sat, stony-faced, in a conference room of a Ukrainian news agency Saturday and described being captured after their armored columns were ambushed. Lt. Dmitry Kovalensky, who had fought in a Russian tank unit and spoke at the behest of his Ukrainian captors, said he recently came under fire from an armed drone and shoulder-launched anti-tank missiles on a road near Sumy in northeastern Ukraine. “The whole column burned,” he said. Around the same time and a few miles away, at a makeshift Ukrainian military base in an abandoned building on the western edge of Kyiv, Ukrainian soldiers prepared for the same sort of ambushes that took out Kovalensky’s unit. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times Lt. Yevgeny Yarantsev of Ukraine said his country’s soldiers fight differently than the Russians. The troops under his command organize in small, nimble units that can sneak up on and ambush the lumbering columns of Russian tanks. “They have a lot of tanks, we have a lot of anti-tank weapons,” said Yarantsev, who previously fought with a volunteer group against Russia in eastern Ukraine. “In the open field, it will be even. It’s easier to fight in the city.” The two young officers — the same rank, but each representing a different country — gave some of the few firsthand accounts of the fighting that have emerged in the 10-day war. The Russian was a prisoner of war speaking under the watchful eye of heavily armed Ukrainian security officials. The Ukrainian spoke as he displayed newly obtained, sophisticated weapons from the United States. The accounts of soldiers from both sides give a small glimpse of how the war is being fought around Kyiv in the north. There, relying largely on ambush tactics, Ukrainian forces have slowed the Russian campaign to encircle and capture the capital, even as Russian troops barrel across the south. Kovalensky and the other Russian prisoners were presented at a news conference intended to support Ukraine’s claim that it had captured a significant number of Russian soldiers. In their statements, the prisoners blended woodenly phrased condemnations of their own country’s leadership with genuine-sounding details of the conflict’s early firefights. According to the rules governing treatment of prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions, governments are supposed to protect a prisoner of war from being made into a “public curiosity,” a concept that is sometimes interpreted as not presenting them in any public setting. The Russian soldiers looked exhausted but showed no outward signs of having been mistreated. The prisoners’ comments and the fact of their capture supported descriptions by Western military analysts and governments of a Russian offensive that has suffered grave setbacks. The Russian army’s superior numbers and equipment, however, could well reverse that trend. “Near the end of the day’s movement on Feb. 27, our column was attacked,” Pvt. Dmitry Gagarin of the Russian army told reporters. “My commander burned and died. I ran into the forest and later surrendered to local people.” Kovalensky said he learned Russia would invade Ukraine only the evening before the tank columns began moving, and that soldiers at the rank of sergeant and lower were not told where they were driving until after crossing the border. All the prisoners described being captured after their armored columns were ambushed on roads, accounts that supported Ukraine’s assertions that its military had made good use of Western-supplied anti-tank weaponry, such as the U.S.-made Javelin missile. But independent analysts have also described more mundane problems for the Russian army, including logistical snarls and a lack of fuel. Yarantsev commands what he described as a mobile group of about 500 soldiers who are skirmishing with the Russians on the western approach to Kyiv. He said the group's prospects were bolstered three days ago when they received Barrett 50-caliber sniper rifles in a shipment from the United States. Sleek and black, with barrels so long they look almost like spears, the rifles were being unpacked and inspected. One sniper, who declined to offer his name, said he had fired one in combat on the outskirts of Kyiv. Yarantsev said the troops were more comfortable being able to garrison in buildings than in fields or forests. “I’ve noticed something about war,” he said. “Soldiers want to be somewhere where cellphones work and where there is internet.” The building where the soldiers were garrisoned, in a leafy residential area of the city, was cluttered with ammunition boxes. Two hand grenades sat on the floor beside a sofa. The soldiers had an electric kettle and offered coffee. In a hallway, a soldier oiled his Kalashnikov rifle. The fighting has been inching closer to the capital. Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said in a statement Saturday that the Russian forces’ primary objective is to encircle Kyiv, following the tactic they have pursued with smaller cities such as Mariupol on the Sea of Azov, which is now surrounded with its heat and electricity cut off. The fighting around Kyiv is mostly in Irpin and Bucha, two outlying towns to the northwest, where conditions are grim. A central street in Bucha is clogged with the burned husks of Russian armored personnel carriers, destroyed in an ambush. Stanislav Bobrytsky, a computer programmer reached by phone in Irpin, said he had not left his apartment since Tuesday. “All the windows are shaking” from blasts, he said. “It’s very scary.” In the center of Kyiv, at the news conference with captured Russian soldiers, the Ukrainian security officials present refused to speak. A moderator passed around a microphone, offering reporters an opportunity to question the prisoners. Kovalensky said he was appealing to the Russian people to rise up and overthrow President Vladimir Putin because the Russian leadership had deceived the army’s officers about the aims of the war and had used the guise of a military exercise to prepare for an invasion. The prisoners said they did not know what would happen to them after the news conference. While they said they were treated well, days after their capture it was unclear if they had showered or been offered clean clothes. © 2022 The New York Times Company",World/The New York Times,Russian Prisoners and Ukrainian Soldiers Describe Two Sides of the Conflict,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-prisoners-ukrainian-soldiers-describe-152726500.html
