12/24/2021,"Environmental organisations across Latin America have called on the United States to reduce plastic waste exports to the region, after a report found the US had doubled exports to some countries in the region during the first seven months of 2020. The US is the world’s largest plastic waste exporter, although it has dramatically reduced its overall plastic waste exports since 2015, when China – previously the top importer – declared it “no longer wanted to be the world’s rubbish dump” and began imposing restrictions. Elsewhere around the world imports are rising, and not least in Latin America, with its cheap labour and close proximity to the US.  More than 75% of imports to the region arrive in Mexico, which received more than 32,650 tons of plastic waste from the US between January and August 2020. El Salvador was second, with 4,054 tons, and Ecuador third, with 3,665 tons, according to research carried out by the Last Beach Cleanup, an environmental advocacy group based in California. While hazardous waste imports are subject to tariffs and restrictions, they are seldom enforced and plastic waste intended for recycling – which until January this year was not considered hazardous under international law – that enters importing countries can often end up as landfill, according to a researchers with the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (Gaia). A Gaia report published in July also predicted further growth in the plastic waste sector in Latin America due to companies in the US and China investing in factories and recycling plants across the region to process the US plastic exports. Some view the practice as a form of environmental colonialism. “The cross-border plastic waste trade is perhaps one of the most nefarious expressions of the commercialisation of common goods and the colonial occupation of territories of the geopolitical south to turn them into sacrifice zones,” said Fernanda Solíz, the health area director at the Simón Bolívar University in Ecuador, in a press statement. “Latin America and the Caribbean are not the back yards of the United States,” Soliz said. “We are sovereign territories, and we demand the respect of the rights of nature and our peoples.” Most of the world’s countries agreed in May 2019 to stem the flow of plastic waste from the developed nations of the global north into the poorer ones of the global south. Known as the plastics amendment to the Basel Convention, the agreement prohibited the export of plastic waste from private entities in the US to those in developing nations without the permission of local governments. But critically, the US did not ratify the agreement, and has been accused of continuing to funnel its waste into countries around the world, including in Africa, south-east Asia, and Latin America. “Regional governments fail in two aspects: the first is inspections at customs because we don’t really know what enters the country under the guise of recycling, and they also fail in their commitments with international agreements such as the Basel Convention.” said Camila Aguilera, a spokesperson for Gaia. “And here it is important to see what comes under the types of recycling because recycling is seen as a good thing.” “Countries in the global north see recycling as something to be proud of, forgetting about redesigning the products and reducing waste,” said Aguilera. “It’s very difficult for governments to treat plastic like toxic waste, but that’s what it is.”",News/Environment,Latin America urges US to reduce plastic waste exports to region,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/24/latin-america-urges-us-to-reduce-plastic-waste-exports-to-region

The N’Golo Kanté-shaped hole in Chelsea’s midfield looks set to be filled, though: he came off the bench in Wednesday’s Carabao Cup win over Brentford, so Kanté v John McGinn looks could be a key battle.

12/24/2021,"Final checks and fuelling are under way for the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, a flagship mission for Nasa that aims to observe worlds beyond the solar system and the first stars and galaxies that lit up the cosmos. If all goes to plan, the $10bn (£7.4bn) observatory will become the largest and most powerful telescope ever sent into space when it blasts off at 12.20pm UK time on Christmas Day onboard an Ariane 5 rocket from the European Space Agency’s spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana.  It has taken more than 30 years to conceive, design and build the telescope and the project has been beset with delays, cost overruns, redesigns, and technical glitches that postponed the launch as recently as this week. “I’m excited and nervous at the same time,” said Prof Martin Barstow, chair of the Space Telescope Institute Council and director of strategic partnerships at Space Park Leicester. “It’s exciting to think that after so long, we might eventually get this telescope into space. But I’m nervous because we all know that however good the rocket is, there are risks in getting there, and a whole lot of things have to go perfectly for us to have a working telescope.” At the heart of Webb is a 6.5-metre primary mirror that will enable the telescope to observe the faint glow from some of the oldest, most distant objects in the universe. Because the universe is expanding, light emitted from stars and galaxies is stretched as it travels, meaning that the glow from the earliest stars is “redshifted” into the longer wavelengths of infrared light. Unlike the Hubble space telescope which orbits the Earth, Webb will orbit the sun. It is bound for a spot called L2, or the second Lagrange point, a million miles from Earth. Here, gravitational forces will allow the telescope to observe the heavens in the infrared realm, with the Earth and the sun to its back. Webb’s primary mirror is so large that it must be folded up for launch and unfolded during the month-long journey to L2. Along the way, the telescope will also deploy a sunshade the size of a tennis court to help shield the telescope from the sun’s rays. “We want it really cold and space isn’t that cold,” said Barstow. “There’s a lot of infrared out there from the Earth and sun that will warm things up. To cool everything down takes a long time.” Beyond observing the first stars and galaxies, Webb will watch alien worlds cross the faces of their stars and measure how infrared light is absorbed in the planets’ atmospheres. This will provide hints about the atmospheric chemistry and potentially conditions ripe for life. “In terms of the science, this is going to be transformational,” said Barstow. “It’s quite simply the largest, most sensitive telescope ever put in space. It’s been designed to look back at the very early history of the universe and to understand the formation of the first stars and galaxies. And it’s about us. It’s about how we came to be and what our place is in the universe.” If Webb arrives at L2 unscathed, mission scientists will spend a further five months checking out the telescope’s systems and ensuring they are working properly before taking data at the start of the summer. “I just want it to be there and working,” Barstow added. “There are thousands of astronomers waiting to use this telescope. It’s important to remember this is a huge endeavour. There will be a lot of people around the world biting their fingernails tomorrow.”",News/Science,Astronomers on tenterhooks as $10bn James Webb telescope set for lift off,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/dec/24/astronomers-on-tenterhooks-as-10bn-james-webb-telescope-set-for-lift-off

12/24/2021,"Mail Online, the online edition of the Daily Mail, has been heavily censured by the press standards regulator for publishing an article referring to “British towns that are no-go areas for white people”. The title’s defence – that no reasonable person was likely to take the claim seriously – was dismissed by the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso).  “The headline claim that there were ‘British towns that are no-go areas for white people’ was not supported by the article. The article included no reference to a town or towns which were claimed to be off-limits to white people, and only one area within a city was described as a ‘no-go area’ for white people,” the organisation said. Mail Online was ordered to publish a correction and ensure that a link to it appeared on the front page of its site. The piece, widely ridiculed when it was published in June, reported claims made in a book by the former Islamist radical Ed Husain titled Among the Mosques: A Journey Across Muslim Britain. The author said he had spoken to a group of white men who claimed they were scared to go to the Whalley Range area of Blackburn. Husain said they cited claims of violence at the hands of Asian teenagers, adding that the local council was racist and would threaten people with eviction for flying the cross of St George. The Mail’s article also included an image of Didsbury beneath the headline “British towns that are no-go areas for white people: Muslim author’s study of mosques reveals children ‘attacked for being white’”. Nevertheless, Ipso found that the title had only suggested Didsbury was home to a mosque hosting a sharia court, not that it had become a “no-go area for white people”. Sharia councils are often accused of operating a “parallel legal system” in the UK but their rulings have no legal standing in British law and they have no enforcement powers. According to Ipso, Mail Online claimed it “considered it to be ‘extremely unlikely that reasonable readers would have taken the impression from the headline that entire towns in Britain are […] entirely inaccessible to white people’”. The committee made no ruling in respect of a second complaint that the article breached clause 12 of its code, which calls on titles to “avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference to an individual’s race, colour, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or to any physical or mental illness or disability”. It said it was unable to consider the issue because the complainant was not personally affected.",News/Media,Mail Online: Ipso upholds complaint over town being ‘no-go area for white people’,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/dec/24/mail-online-ipso-upholds-complaint-over-town-being-no-go-area-for-white-people
12/24/2021,"The government is planning to send out a UK-wide mobile alert urging the public to get a Covid booster, a move mobile operators fear could spark a backlash from customers opposed to vaccinations. The UK’s biggest mobile operators – EE, O2, Vodafone and Three UK – have been asked by the government to send a message on Boxing Day.  The campaign, in which mobile operators would send a message on behalf of the government to their tens of millions of customers, is understood to have not yet been given final signoff. The message is likely to be on behalf of the NHS, with the text encouraging all adults to get an additional vaccination. The proposed copy of the text message will say: “Get boosted now. Every adult needs a Covid-19 booster vaccine to protect against Omicron. Get your Covid-19 vaccine or booster. See NHS website for details.” It is understood that the mobile operators will all enable the message to be sent, but some are agreeing with others reluctance given the highly politicised nature of the vaccination programme. “Operators feel a little nervous about angering some customers because it is such a heated issue,” a telecoms industry source said. “We will make it happen, but don’t want those who don’t agree with the message to blame us.” Earlier this month, Tesco’s festive TV campaign featuring Santa Claus bearing a Covid vaccine passport was cleared by the UK ad watchdog, despite anti-vaccination campaigners making it the second-most complained about advert of all time. Last March, at the beginning of the pandemic, the government used mobile operators to send a non-controversial message regarding support of the NHS and offering general coronavirus health advice. It is understood that the government plan will not use the nationwide mobile emergency alert system, set up to send targeted information in cases of events such as floods. If it goes ahead, the message will instead be sent by operators separately. In October, the government launched a nationwide advertising campaign encouraging people to take up Covid-19 booster jabs. The push comes as Boris Johnson used his Christmas message on Friday to tell the public to give the “wonderful” gift of a booster jab to their families this year. Johnson admitted that after nearly two years it was not possible to say the pandemic was receding, as the UK reported a record 120,000 new coronavirus cases on Thursday. In the speech, Johnson said: “Though the time for buying presents is theoretically running out, there is still a wonderful thing you can give your family and the whole country, and that is to get that jab, whether it is your first or second, or your booster, so that next year’s festivities are even better than this year’s.” The government decided against implementing further Covid restrictions before Christmas, but is likely to implement some form of lockdown rules next week or early in the new year. On Thursday, the latest analysis by the UK Health Security Agency suggested that Omicron is milder than past Covid variants such as Delta, with 50%-70% of people less likely to be admitted to hospital. However, data also showed that protection from a booster starts to wane after 10 weeks.

12/24/2021,"Anthony Smith, who has died aged 83, was the brains behind the creation of Channel 4, which he envisaged as a new kind of publicly owned television channel for turning fresh ideas and minority views into programmes made by independent producers. At a time of just three channels, BBC1, BBC2 and ITV, he dedicated himself in the 1970s to media reform, and lobbied for an open broadcasting authority to run a vacant fourth channel, in a democratic opening up of the airwaves, unleashing “an imp in the mechanism”. The Guardian acted as a facilitator, publishing two lengthy articles by Smith in 1972 and 1974 as he refined the concept. He then became director of the British Film Institute (1979-88), well positioned to influence the final decision. Although holding centre-left political views, he won support from Margaret Thatcher’s 1979 government, by meeting Keith Joseph, one of the prime minister’s most influential allies, and recasting the argument as a way of introducing competition and enterprise into broadcasting, while keeping public service dominant. Smith was a thinking person, combining unobtrusive sharpness with persistence: his personal charm and hospitality softened a serious intensity.  This approach saw off ITV’s claim on the fourth channel and won round the home secretary, Willie Whitelaw. The 1980 Broadcasting Act paved the way, and two years later Channel 4 was launched, with Smith serving as a board member (1980-84). One driving conviction of his survived to the end: Smith believed in the importance of independent institutions, which foster sound values and nurture people. “I believe in a collegiate system – Channel 4 as originally practised. I hate state control,” he said. In 1987, he expected to succeed Jeremy Isaacs as chief executive of Channel 4, believing Richard Attenborough, the new chairman, had promised him the job. “There is only one reason I would take the job, darling. If I become chairman you will have to become chief executive when Jeremy goes,” went the reported exchange. But when it came to the crunch, the board chose Michael Grade. Smith felt betrayed. “May God forgive them,” he said. I witnessed Attenborough delivering the news to Smith at the BFI, where he was launching the London film festival and his project, the Museum of the Moving Image, backed by Paul Getty. He crumpled. After he left the BFI, the museum eventually closed. Earlier in 1987 he was unsuccessful in his bid to succeed Alasdair Milne as BBC director general – the accountant Michael Checkland was appointed. He had also been rejected in 1982 when Milne was selected. Smith ranked these as his biggest disappointments. But he then enjoyed a remarkable consolation. In 1974 he had taken up a set of rooms in the Albany apartment complex on Piccadilly, opposite Fortnum & Mason, at the heart of the establishment. There he entertained stylishly: silver teapot, fruitcake, bone china cups and saucers. His open-house policy led by chance in 1988 to the “best bit” of his life, appointment as president of Magdalen College, one of Oxford’s oldest and wealthiest colleges. A Financial Times foreign writer was a guest of Smith’s at the Albany, and his lengthy dinner with a fellow of Magdalen ended in the latter staying overnight on Smith’s sofa. Smith was suddenly on Magdalen’s radar. “I ran it,” he said with relish, “with a finger in every single pie.” The Grade I-listed buildings were cherished, but so was a new building, an auditorium where films were screened. In 1989 Magdalen launched the Oxford Science Park, now home to scores of businesses. In 1999 he invited the Russian Yukos oil plutocrat Mikhail Khodorkovsky to a college dinner. At this point Khodorkovsky was seemingly espousing a new form of socially aware Russian capitalism: “He asked us to find a way to help very able young Russians undertake a degree at Oxford – a sort of Russian Rhodes scholarship – which the Rhodes Trust helped us with in the early years.” They were called Hill scholars, named after the office in Hill Street, off Piccadilly, administering the funds. But by 2003 Khodorkovsky had become a threat to Putin and was arrested and charged with fraud. “As he was about to be arrested in Russia he sent a message asking if we would be willing to help establish a fund to cover the costs of Russian students in their own universities. He said there would be a large sum available,” said Smith. A donation of $500m arrived. Khodorkovsky was released from prison in 2013. Smith meanwhile set up the Khodorkovsky Foundation, which he chaired, after checking with the Foreign Office and Charity Commission. This second initiative supports students through a network of 20 Russian universities. By 2020, 45,000 students and 150 Hill scholars had benefited. Its third duty is to support an orphanage school for 200 children near Moscow set up by Khodorkovsky’s parents. It also provides an English-language academic library. James Curran, a friend, said of Smith: “He was a brilliant fundraiser. In business he would have made a fortune, but that was not his game.” Smith believed that the charities would influence the future of Russia, educating a fresh political class. Born Harrow on the Hill, northwest London, Anthony was the son of Esther and Henry Smith, a civil servant, and early in the second world war the family was evacuated to Rhyl, in north Wales. On their return to London, Anthony went to Harrow county school for boys, and from there to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he studied English. He joined the BBC in 1960 as a current affairs producer, editing 24 Hours, the influential daily current affairs programme launched in 1965, providing the template for Newsnight. However, in 1971 he resigned and, as a fellow of St Antony’s College, Oxford, for the next five years developed his ideas on public service broadcasting in the belief that it was failing through being too middlebrow and out of touch. So he picked up his pen, turned to activism, mulled wider media reforms and outlined Channel 4. The most influential book of the 15 he authored was The Shadow in the Cave (1973), an examination of the relationship between the broadcaster, the audience and the state. He submitted evidence to the Annan committee on broadcasting, whose eventual report in 1977 adopted the proposal for an Open Broadcasting Authority. He also contributed to the inconclusive Third Royal Commission on the Press (1974-77). Though in 1987 he was made a CBE, in Curran’s view he was “judged to be the enemy”. Smith came to be highly critical of Channel 4, which he believed had lost its way after Grade’s arrival, though he welcomed those of its executives who consulted him. In 2005 he stepped down at Magdalen, and in his final years he enjoyed reading very long novels.
