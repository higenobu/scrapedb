5/11/2022,"The six-week-long lockdown in Shanghai, along with a string of lockdowns in other cities in the surrounding Yangtze River Delta region, has dealt another heavy blow to the region's once-thriving live-streaming industry after being hit hard by a regulatory crackdown last year. Having been stuck at her Shanghai flat for 40 days straight, 27-year-old professional live-streamer Zhu Cancan said she has mostly given up the job for now. Zhu still sets a morning alarm, but not to get ready for work. She wakes up early to get a jump on buying fresh food on grocery apps. Her more relaxed schedule now usually consists of playing the Tencent Holdings mobile game Honour of Kings in the morning and an online version of Mahjong with friends in the afternoon. In the evening, she binge watches TV dramas. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

""It's basically impossible for you to sell products via live-streaming under the Shanghai lockdown. Express delivery systems are not working, so I'm unable to receive products that I planned to sell. Teammates are also being locked in other places,"" Zhu said. ""Brands are also being hit hard, and many have already cut their budgets."" ""If you could make 200,000 yuan [US$30,000] a month in the past, now it's around 40,000, or zero,"" she added. Zhu still gets some income by posting advertisements on her social media accounts such as Weibo, the Chinese microblogging platform where she has 3.4 million followers. Zhu, from Anhui province, is one of hundreds of live-streamers whose life has been turned upside down by the Shanghai lockdown, amid disruptions to logistics flows and weakened demand in a slowing economy. In March, total retail sales of consumer goods in China declined 3.5 per cent year on year, compared with the 34.2 per cent jump last year amid a recovery from the 2020 downturn, according to official government data. Private express delivery systems, which is how goods purchased online are typically sent, have been severely disrupted by pandemic control measures. Many online merchants now keep their buyers apprised of changing conditions by sending them lists of cities and districts to which they are currently unable to ship products. In a list shared by a bookstore on Taobao, 16 provinces - including eastern Jiangsu and Zhejiang and northern Heilongjiang - have been affected. Taobao is owned by Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the South China Morning Post. Since Shanghai's lockdown started on April 1, residents have only been able to obtain essentials through group buying and government supplies. E-commerce purchases for unessential items like books and coffee are unlikely to be delivered. Zhu said a friend in Hangzhou now only gets about two ads per month for her live-streaming channel, where she previously had ads nearly every day. ""Not only are influencers in Shanghai affected, the situation is also not good for those living outside Shanghai,"" Zhu said. ""Brands are in Shanghai, consumption power is in Shanghai, advertising companies are in Shanghai. You just can't do your work efficiently."" Zheng Liuping, a live-streamer living in Yiwu, Zhejiang province, has struggled to keep his business operating as usual during the outbreak. Yiwu, another city with a vibrant live-streaming community, conducted mass testing last month after reporting a few local Covid-19 cases. ""Many consumers cancelled their orders as they are unable to receive the products,"" Zheng said. ""Although we get a similar amount of traffic, the orders we receive are less than before."" Deng Jinling, another Yiwu resident, uses live-streaming companies to help her sell thermoses domestically. However, deliveries are often postponed or cancelled, she said. ""You may see place A locked down, and place B operating normally. Later, place A may open up, but place B is locked down. We are stuck in a cycle,"" she said. Early in the pandemic, China's live-streaming industry benefited from changing consumer habits as people were forced to do more of their shopping online while confined at home. In 2020, the scale of China's live-streaming e-commerce industry exceeded 1.2 trillion yuan, nearly triple the size of the previous year. The industry is projected to exceed 4.9 trillion yuan in 2023, according to an iResearch report published last September. The industry has also been targeted by regulators. In one of the more high-profile cases, tax authorities fined live-streaming queen Viya 1.3 billion yuan in December for tax evasion. Her official Weibo account and her Taobao shop later disappeared from the internet. Under rules jointly issued in March by the Cyberspace Administration of China, State Taxation Administration, and State Administration for Market Regulation, platforms are required to provide reports on their live-streamers twice a year, which must include details such as personal identification numbers, bank account information and income.

Photo: AFP> The situation in the live-streaming e-commerce sector shows a wider disruption of the e-commerce industry, according to Chen Tao, an e-commerce analyst at Analysys. ""The essence is the disruption of logistics flows, which affect the normal operations of the live-streaming e-commerce sector,"" he said. Chen said he expects the industry will recover once the outbreak is under control. Carrie Zhang, a Shanghai-based partner at Bain & Company, also sees potential benefits to the industry in the long run. Despite the ""short-term disturbance"", new habits have emerged among younger consumers, such as those in Generation Z, who often use live streaming and other internet videos to get information on brands. ""The industry has experienced hyper growth [over 100 per cent year on year] in the past few years,"" Zhang said, ""With major players already achieving sizeable gross merchandise value in 2021, the growth rate is expected to come down this year. However, [live streaming] is probably still going to be the fastest-growing e-commerce format in China."" For now, though, Zhu has been using this period to take a break from the constant grind of the industry, as she has been able to live on her savings. It has also helped stem the tide of constant notifications. ""Before the outbreak, I saw many new friend requests on WeChat every day when I woke up,"" she said. ""But now no one adds me.""

5/11/2022,"During the three years since a 15-year-old Bradenton boy’s teacher started a sexual relationship with him, he lost his chance at a regular high school experience, the now-18-year-old said in a courtroom Tuesday. He never went to a high school football game. He never went to prom. He lost all his friends because he no longer wanted to socialize. During his darkest period, he spent a year and a half without leaving his bedroom. He blamed himself for what happened, and one day his mother had to rush him to a hospital because he attempted to take his own life. “What happened to my son is every parent’s worst nightmare. We are supposed to be able to send our children to school and know they are safe and taken care of by their teachers,” the mother said through tears as she read a prepared statement. Kassandra Moore, a former private school teacher, was convicted on March 11 after pleading guilty to four counts of sexual battery of a minor more than 12 years of age and less than 18 years of age by a person in custodial authority and one count of transmission of harmful material to a minor. Moore was a teacher at The Broach School, 2615 26th St. W., Bradenton, in 2019 when she began the relationship with her ninth grade student. Moore was sentenced to 20 years in prison by Circuit Judge Frederick P. Mercurio on Tuesday. Following her release from prison, Mercurio order that she serve two years of house arrest followed by eight years of sexual predator probation — noting that it was the longest term of supervision he could order. As part of her supervision, she was also ordered to undergo another psychological evaluation within 30 days of her release from prison and undergo any treatment or take any medication ordered. She was also ordered to attend sex offender treatment during that same time. Moore, who also goes by her married name Kassandra Taylor, is prohibited from contacting the victim or having any intentional contact with anyone under the age of 18. She will also be designated a sexual predator. The former teacher was ordered to pay restitution to the victim, an amount to be later determined to ensure that he gets any counseling any help dealing with the trauma, Mercurio said. On Tuesday, reading a prepared statement, Moore asked the judge not to send her to prison. While awaiting trial, Moore had been out on bond until remanded into sheriff’s office custody following her March plea. She saw two different mental health professionals before undergoing a psychological evaluation as part of the court mandated pre-sentencing investigation. However, she refused to discuss the criminal allegations she faced with the first counselor and later with a licensed psychiatrist. She also did not continue with regular counseling or take the medication prescribed to her by the psychiatrist. Moore’s defense attorney, Andrew Pouget, told the court she has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, multiple personality disorder, unspecified sexual dysfunction, post-traumatic stress disorder and cleidocranial dysplasia, a rare genetic condition that affects teeth and bones, such as the skull, face, spine, collarbones and legs. Among the possible symptoms are small stature — Moore is about 4 feet 8 inches tall and weighs between 80-85 pounds. If she went to prison, Moore and her attorney argued that she would not get the help she needs. “Ms. Moore said that instead of therapy and medication, she sought emotional support from a few close friends as well as her husband. She said she also attends church and talks to a pastor,” Mercurio said Tuesday. However, the judge said that was a “rejection of psychological treatment.” “I heard her say in her own words how she would be deprived if I sent her to prison because she wouldn’t get this treatment. Yet while she is out on bond has the nerve to tell me she couldn’t even participate while on bond. How could I believe both?” Mercurio said raising his voice in apparent frustration. The biggest irony in the case, the judge said, is that Moore has a degree in psychology. “She said she felt emotional highs for days because of her interaction with the boys,” Mercurio went to read from the report. “She has a lot of difficulty taking responsibility for her own choices. She feels as if she is the victim. She has a constant need for attention and adoration.” “I have no doubt that she suffers from mental illness ... But when you reject medications the psychiatrist gave you and then sit here and tell me not to send you to prison because you won’t have access to that treatment, I am sorry I just don’t buy it,” Mercurio concluded before moving to his sentence.",U.S./Bradenton Herald,Former Bradenton teacher gets prison time for sexual battery of 15-year-old student,https://news.yahoo.com/former-bradenton-teacher-gets-prison-201744469.html
5/11/2022,"Lawyers for Tibetan herder Dingzhen Zhenzhu are taking action against people flaming him on social media. Dingzhen first went viral in November 2020 for his bright smile in a clip from a short film. But Dingzhen has also been criticized online by those calling him the epitome of superficiality. A Tibetan yak herder once known as the most handsome man in China has learned a harsh lesson: social media fame comes with a heavy price. This week, lawyers for Dingzhen Zhenzhu issued a letter via his agent warning people to stop making defamatory comments about him, particularly those containing ""insulting, terrifying, vulgar, or vilifying words."" Representatives for Dingzhen said in the letter that the Tibetan-farmhand-turned-social-media-star had been the target of vulgar and belittling comments on social media that have had a ""serious impact"" on him. Dingzhen first went viral on Chinese social media in November 2020, when a short clip of him smiling captured the hearts of Chinese internet users. The clip of Dingzhen, then 20, spread like wildfire on China's TikTok, Douyin, leading web users to dub him the most handsome man in China, per the SCMP. The clip originated from a short film of Dingzhen in Tibet, walking over the plains and talking about his daily life on the grasslands. The clip went so viral that Hua Chunying, a Chinese government spokesperson, highlighted his ""bright, sunny, and innocent smile"" on her Twitter page. Because of that clip, Dingzhen managed to secure a job in his county of Litang in the southwestern Sichuan province as a tourism ambassador, and was even sent as one of China's representatives to a United Nations Development Program event for World Earth Day in 2021. However, while Chinese social media users fawned over him and dubbed him the ""smile of the plateau"" and a ""sweet wild boy,"" he has faced continuous criticism. For one, his image took a hit after a photo of him vaping was leaked on social media. He has also been the target of putdowns on China's Twitter-like site Weibo, with online posters calling Dingzhen the epitome of superficiality in China, and mocking the success he's attained despite not being highly educated. In a statement attached to the lawyer's letter, Dingzhen cautioned people to not ""do anything evil, no matter how trivial you think it is."" Dingzhen and his representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider.
