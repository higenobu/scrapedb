4/6/2022,"A white woman who raised $200,000 in the name of Philando Castile to pay off or supplement student lunch debt in the St. Paul school district, must pay back $120,000 to the state for misappropriating the funds. State prosecution states the fundraiser only gave a fraction of the money raised to the intended cause. The New York Times reports that on Monday, March 28, the office of Minnesota’s attorney general, Keith Ellison, announced that Pamela Fergus, a former psychology professor at Metropolitan State University, has agreed to a settlement that will repay thousands of dollars collected during an online fundraiser titled “Philando Feeds the Children.” The agreement, which did not require Fergus to admit guilt, was filed in Ramsey County District Court. Now, by court order, she is banned “from handling charitable funds” in the state. Fergus launched the fundraiser in 2017, a year after Castile was killed by a police officer during a traffic stop. Before his untimely death, the Black man served as a nutrition supervisor at the J.J. Hill Montessori school and often paid school lunch fees for students in need. The disgraced educator promised “every dollar” donated would go to the relief of the lunch debts of elementary school students. The state alleges this did not happen. In June 2021, the Charities Division of the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office sued Fergus for “failing to properly spend all the money she raised in the name” the man kids affectionately called Mr. Phil. The lawsuit reveals Fergus originally set the target goal of the fundraiser at $5,000 on the crowdfunding platform YouCaring.org with a cause statement that read, “Please help Philando continue to feed his kids.” The page said the monies raised would go to the elementary school where Castile used to work. Once a national spotlight was placed on the crowdfunding campaign money started to pour in. Fergus bumped up the target goal to $999,999 and raised $207,826 in cash for children who could not afford food during their break. In October 2017, the woman was quoted saying, “We actually have enough money now to pay off all of the schools in the St. Paul public school district … So all of the grade schools, all of the middle schools, and all of the high schools. Plus, more. I mean, we’re still making money.” “I don’t think there’s an end in sight,” the lawsuit says she said to a news outlet. “I want a million dollars in that account. That’s my goal. I want a million dollars.” The money was pouring in, but it was deposited in her personal account and only $80,058.99 was donated to Saint Paul Public Schools. According to school officials, Fergus wrote three checks from the fundraiser to the district: (1) a check for $10,000 on Oct. 13, 2017; (2) a check for $35,035.99 on Feb. 27, 2018; and (3) a check for $35,000 on Aug. 13, 2018. Fergus also proposed on the website that there would be an in-class service project for an undergraduate class she taught at the college connected to the effort to relieve school lunch debt for students. Castile’s mother Valerie Castile suspected something was wrong with the charity drive and questioned how the money was being used. Her concerns prompted her to contact Ellison’s office and an investigation was launched. In a statement to the attorney general’s office, the mother said about the settlement, “You should put that money where it’s supposed to go. These things are not for your personal gain. It’s not right.” The attorney general said in a statement the monies received from the settlement will be distributed throughout the “Saint Paul Public Schools for the restricted purpose of paying off lunch debts of children in need — the purpose for which Minnesotans donated the funds in the first place.” Minnesota laws around charitable giving and fundraising are clear. “Those who raise money for a charitable purpose have important duties,” the attorney general’s office states. “They cannot mislead or deceive donors about how funds will be used, must use the money for the exact purpose that donors intended, and must have procedures in place to make sure the money is used properly. In addition, those who raise more than $25,000 or meet some other conditions must register and file specific paperwork with the Attorney General’s office.” “This settlement helps to ensure that the money donors gave in Philando’s name will go back to where it was intended — to help Saint Paul kids who struggle to pay for school lunches,” Attorney General Ellison said. He continued, “Philando Castile cared deeply about the children he served, and the children loved him back. Failing to use every dollar raised to help those children was an insult to Philando’s legacy and all who loved him.” “This settlement helps right that wrong by continuing Philando’s commitment to serving students in need and ensures that the powerful impact he had during his life will continue to live as his legacy to the children and all of us.” Ellison has paid particular attention to identifying people who commit fraud by initiating crowd fundraising campaigns, specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the lawsuit, he cites a 2020 study on GoFundMe, a popular fundraising platform and states, “Between March 1 and August 31, 2020, GoFundMe donors gave over $625 million for relief efforts related to the COVID-19 pandemic — such as buying personal protective equipment for frontline workers or providing school supplies for students transitioning to remote learning.” Ellison further reveals in just six months after George Floyd’s death, in another police-involved killing in the same state where an officer killed Castile, donors gave approximately $3 million in donations through online donations. Under the settlement agreement, Fergus is mandated to pay Minnesota $400 each month from June to February 2024. On or before March 3, 2024, she has to cough up approximately $111,000 out of her retirement funds. She will be immediately liable if she does not meet these payments and will be responsible for the total amount of her bill.",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,"‘Not For Your Personal Gain’: Minnesota Professor Raised $200K In Philando Castile’s Name for Student Lunch Debt, Now She’s Ordered to Pay Back Funds She Misappropriated",https://news.yahoo.com/not-personal-gain-minnesota-professor-184500385.html
4/6/2022,"Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko said Russian soldiers raped, tortured, and killed a woman. She shared an image on Twitter of what appeared to be a swastika carved crudely onto someone's skin. Reports of war crimes like mass killings and rapes have emerged from Ukraine in recent weeks. A Ukrainian MP said this week that Russian troops carved a swastika onto a woman they tortured, raped, and killed. MP Lesia Vasylenko tweeted a graphic image on Monday of what appeared to be an exposed torso featuring a large swastika that appeared to be carved into burned skin. ""Tortured body of a raped and killed woman. I'm speechless. My@mind is paralyzed with anger and fear and hatred. #StopGenocide #StopPutinNOW,"" Vasylenko wrote in the post. In a separate tweet on April 5, Vasylenko claimed that the Ukrainian government had found records of 5,000 war crimes committed by Russia. Insider was unable to independently verify Vasylenko's claims. However, footage posted on YouTube by independent journalist Patrick Lancaster from a school basement in Mariupol appears to show the same body lying on the ground. Lancaster's video has since been removed but appears to still be circulating on Twitter. Images of mass graves have emerged from Bucha following reports of a massacre in the city. These reports of Russian atrocities have prompted Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accuse Russia of ""genocide."" President Joe Biden has also called for Putin to be put on trial as a war criminal.

4/6/2022,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, in a phone call on Monday, with Beijing again calling on talks to end the conflict in Ukraine. The call, which Beijing said was made at Ukraine's request, was the first reported high-level conversation between the countries since March 1, when Kuleba asked Beijing to use its ties with Moscow to stop Russia's invasion, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said at the time. ""Wars end eventually. The key is how to reflect on the pain, to maintain lasting security in Europe and establish a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism,"" Wang said, according to the ministry. ""China stands ready to play a constructive role in this regard in an objective position."" Kuleba tweeted: ""Grateful to my Chinese counterpart for solidarity with civilian victims."" ""We both share the conviction that ending the war against Ukraine serves common interests of peace, global food security and international trade,"" he said. China, which has grown closer with Moscow in recent years while it has also had cordial diplomatic ties and strong trade links with Ukraine, has refused to condemn Russia's attack on the country or to call its actions there an invasion. Russia launched what it calls a ""special operation"" in Ukraine on Feb 24.

4/6/2022,"Mark Wahlberg totally transformed his body for his role in the upcoming movie, ""Father Stu"" but not in the way you'd expect! The 50-year-old actor put on a pants-popping 30 extra pounds in just six weeks to play the boxer-turned-priest, Stuart Long. Wahlberg ate a 7,000 calorie a day diet consisting of at least a dozen eggs, big bowls of rice and protein shakes to prep for the role. “I had six weeks to put on about 30 pounds,"" Wahlberg told ET Canada. ""I started with 7,000 calories for the first two weeks and then 11,000 calories for the final four weeks. None of it was fun, except for the first meal was amazing, because I hadn’t eaten anything up until that point. But after that, when you’re already full and you have to eat again, and at my age it’s just not a healthy thing to do, to try to put on that kind of weight in that amount of time.” Wahlberg wasn't chowing down on junk food to make gainz. Instead, he ate smaller, carefully curated meals with the goal of putting on weight. “I wasn’t eating anything that you would think, ‘Oh my God, I get to sit on the couch and eat ice cream and pizzas,'” he said. “… I tried to do it in a healthy way. It was a dozen eggs and a dozen pieces of bacon, two baked potatoes, a Porterhouse steak, two bowls of white rice, and a glass of olive oil. The first two weeks were high proteins. The second two weeks were a lot of carbs. The last two weeks starches, and then sodium, just to kind of get as bloated as possible. So not a lot of fun.” Wahlberg's chef, Lawrence Duran previously told E! News about what he was feeding the star to get ""in shape"" for the film. ""We do good carbohydrates, dark green vegetables, and then, just switch up the protein throughout the day and, at least, a dozen eggs a day."" The actor consumed ground meats and leafy vegetables at precise intervals and adding mass weight gainer to protein shakes. ""Mark’s chef was using a weight gainer powder that’s dense in protein and complex carbohydrates,"" nutritionist Christina Meyer-Jax, RDN told TODAY Food. ""Adding this powder to regular calorie foods will pump up overall intake. However, Mark was also eating high fat meats such as bacon, big servings of proteins, and large amounts of grains such as white rice."" Meyer-Jax noted that abdominal weight gain, also known as visceral fat, in the long run is not a healthy weight gain for those looking to increase weight and that even normal-weight people with excess visceral fat have a notably higher risk of health problems. And if a glass of olive oil doesn't sound like an appetizing aperitif, Wahlberg said the worst part was actually having to eat when he was still full from his last meal. The actor continued with his normal workout routine while expanding his waistline. “I had to get up the appetite, so I would go in there and try to lift as heavy as possible just to get hungry,” Wahlberg told ET. “And then I’d have the weight gainer shakes as well and all that stuff. But none of it was fun. There’s nothing worse than when you’re full from the last meal and you have to eat again.” Meyer-Jax said that when it comes to your health, you must always consider the quality of the calories you’re consuming. She said the best way to approach healthy weight gain is to follow a program that includes healthy fats, complex carbohydrates, fruits and veggies, and loads of lean protein sources. ""Loading up on processed and fast foods will lead to weight gain, but also lead to systemic inflammation putting a person at risk for chronic disease,"" she said. Just in time for the movie's April 13 release date, Wahlberg is already back in fighting shape at his normal, lower weight but Meyer-Jax said that this is not something you should try at home. ""Mark Wahlberg was doing this drastic metabolic move for a professional role and was medically monitored throughout by doctors and nutritionists,"" she said. ""This is not a healthy approach to weight gain — or weight loss — for most people. Each person can react differently to this drastic shift and it's hardly ever sustainable for long term health.""",Health/TODAY,Mark Wahlberg says he drank glasses of olive oil to get ready for new role,https://news.yahoo.com/mark-wahlberg-eating-7-000-194635528.html
