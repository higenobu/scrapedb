12/24/2021,"The spike in cases caused by Omicron is forcing states that had previously adopted Covid-zero approaches to confront their first major outbreaks since the beginning of the pandemic, with South Australia recording more infections per capita on Friday than Victoria. On Friday SA recorded 688 new Covid-19 infections, with the state’s premier, Steven Marshall, revealing about 70% of them were from the Omicron variant.  “What we are very concerned about is the very significant increase in transmissibility. We do have to take action,” Marshall said on Friday. The SA government has responded by overturning a ban on rapid antigen testing, as well as continuing with a number of restrictions that had been due to end on 28 December. In Queensland, where 589 new cases were recorded on Friday, the health minister, Yvette D’Ath, warned residents to “get ready for Covid”. But in New South Wales, where case numbers began to dramatically spike as a result of the Omicron variant earlier in December, early reports from some frontline doctors have provided reason for optimism. On Thursday the state’s premier, Dominic Perrottet, said emerging data from NSW suggested the Omicron variant was “five times less severe” than the Delta variant. Chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said evidence from both here and overseas indicated “infection with Omicron is likely to be milder than infection with Delta, with the risk of hospitalisation being about 60% to 80% less than for Delta”. That was supported by a UK government study released on Friday, which suggested the risk of being admitted to hospital was up to 70% less for people with Omicron compared to those infected with Delta. General practitioner Ziad Basyouny helped to establish out-of-hospital care for Covid-19 patients in western Sydney during the Delta wave, and has continued to work in that team during the Omicron outbreak. Basyouny was unequivocal about the difference in presentations between the Delta and Omicron strains, saying the latter had so far seen most patients develop “very, very minor symptoms”. “It’s so apparent. Tomorrow I will have about 20 patients who are at high risk. Of those 19 will have no symptoms. It’s so different to Delta. During Delta I’d call maybe 60 people a day and out of those all 60 would have symptoms,” he said. “People say it’s too early to call it milder and I know it’s too early for epidemiologists, but clinically I can’t say anything else. I can’t change the fact that these patients are presenting as less severe.” Despite that, the pace of the outbreak in NSW has seen increasing pressure on the health system. About 1,5000 healthcare workers have been forced to isolate either because they have contracted the virus or are deemed a close contact. At the same time, the number of people receiving care outside hospital has fallen. On 14 December there were 3,300 people receiving some form of care out of hospital, about 65% of active cases. By the 22 December that figure had dropped to only 38% of active cases. According to Basyouny that was both a result of the variant’s milder outcomes, but also the ballooning case numbers. “The system would not cope if we continued to monitor all people who were infected even if they did not have symptoms, so we have to risk stratify people,” he said, adding that he had “no doubt” case numbers in NSW would reach 25,000 a day in the coming weeks. On Friday New South Wales recorded another 5,612 cases of the virus, as indoor mask mandates were reintroduced following a surge in cases of the Omicron variant – it now accounts for about 80% of the state’s cases. Despite reports of the strain’s mildness, the rapid increase in Omicron cases has still seen hospitalisation rates rise as many more people catch the virus. In the past 10 days the number of people in hospital with Covid has increased from 168 to 382. The state’s paramedics have also sounded the alarm about record numbers of triple-zero calls, leading to significant delays in response to emergency calls. The outbreak has also led to increased pressure on the state’s testing system, prompting a shift in the government’s messaging to urge people not to get tested unless they had symptoms or had been in close contact with a Covid positive person. “NSW Health reminds people that when you receive that notification from the QR check-in, that just lets you know someone was in that vicinity or premise who subsequently tested Covid positive,” Chant said on Friday. “What we’re stressing is that’s a prompt, a reminder for you to monitor for symptoms, so please get tested if you’re unwell but don’t get tested unless you are feeling unwell. “It is important we keep those testing resources focused on people that have symptoms or people that we’ve directed from public health to get tested or where you know you’ve had close contact with a case.” Victoria reported 2,095 new Covid-19 cases and eight deaths on Friday. A total of 397 patients are in hospital, including 75 in intensive care, with 40 on ventilation. The seven-day hospitalisation average is steady at 392. An indoor mask mandate for people eight years and older came into effect in Victoria on Friday. Masks will also be required at all major events with more than 30,000 patrons, including the Boxing Day Test at the MCG, but can be removed while seated outdoors. Masks are already required in retail settings, for hospitality workers and on public transport. The government is also recommending Victorians work from home over the festive season and hospitality venues are being asked to consider providing seated-only service.

12/24/2021,"King Felipe is expected to try to turn the page on another turbulent year for Spain’s royal family in his annual Christmas Eve address, amid speculation that his father, Juan Carlos, hopes to return to the country soon. The former monarch abdicated in favour of his son seven years ago and left Spain abruptly for the United Arab Emirates in August 2020 in an attempt to protect the crown from a series of damaging allegations about his financial dealings.  Felipe had sought to stem the damage months earlier by stripping Juan Carlos of his annual stipend and renouncing his personal inheritance from his father in response to reports that he was in line to receive millions of euros from a secret offshore fund with ties to Saudi Arabia. This month the Spanish newspaper El Mundo cited sources close to Juan Carlos earlier as saying the 83-year-old was keen to return to Spain on a temporary basis as early as January. The report came hours after Geneva’s top prosecutor’s office said it had closed a criminal investigation into allegations of money laundering stemming from a $100m (£75m) payment from Saudi Arabia, because of insufficient evidence. Juan Carlos was not among the five indicted suspects in the case. The prosecutor’s office said the investigation had established that Riyadh made the payment to a Panama-based foundation whose beneficial owner was Juan Carlos, but it had been unable to clearly link the payment to a 2011 deal under which a Spanish consortium was awarded a €6.7bn (£5.7bn) contract to build a high-speed rail line in Saudi Arabia. The Swiss investigation was one of several launched in recent years into the financial arrangements of the former king, undermining the Spanish monarchy’s fragile grip on power and denting the popularity of a leader who played a pivotal role in restoring democracy to Spain after the death of Gen Francisco Franco in 1975. Supreme court prosecutors in Spain continue to examine allegations of kickbacks from the Saudi Arabia deal and potential tax fraud. Juan Carlos has said he never told his son he was to benefit from two offshore funds, but has made no further comment on the allegations. Spain’s Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, brushed off suggestions of an imminent return this month, saying the government had not had any conversations with the royal household about it. “We’re talking about two different institutions, which obviously collaborate and cooperate in an extraordinary way, but the Spanish government has not been consulted on this question,” Sánchez said. “Of course, I believe that King Juan Carlos has to provide explanations.” The former king’s wish to return to Spain could be further complicated by a case playing out in a high court in London, where a former lover has alleged she was subjected to a campaign of harassment by state agents directed by him. In a skeleton argument presented to the court in early December, lawyers for Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein said she was seeking damages for the “great mental pain, alarm, anxiety, distress, loss of wellbeing, humiliation and moral stigma she has suffered.” Juan Carlos’s lawyer argued that sovereign immunity should apply in the case. In written arguments before the court, Daniel Bethlehem QC said the former king “rejects the allegations made against him, and any alleged wrongdoing by the Spanish state is denied in the strongest of terms.”",News/World news,King Felipe to give annual address amid rumours father wants to return to Spain,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/24/king-felipe-annual-address-rumours-father-juan-carlos-wants-to-return-to-spain
12/24/2021,"To me, the Christmas season doesn’t start when offices close. It’s not when the first person on the street turns on the Christmas lights, or even once the Christmas pageant has been held. It’s the first day I hear a carol.  Everyone’s got their favourites. It might be a classic or a cover, religious or secular, joyful or sad. Whatever it may be, and however much we might roll our eyes, it’s a great time for music. Which means a great time for musicians. Christmas music has long been helping artists make money. In fact, the Guinness Book of World Records calls Bing Crosby’s 1942 White Christmas the bestselling single of all time, with more than 50m sales worldwide. There was a time when releasing a Christmas album was an artist’s best hope at making a few dollars, and while there’s no exhaustive source of album releases, Allmusic data suggests there were more than 230 Christmas albums released in 2001. Source: author calculations based on Allmusic By 2011, that number had plunged to a little over 90. A rough early count suggests that this year, the tally will be about 60. What’s with the decline of Christmas albums? First, it’s symptomatic of the slow demise of albums more broadly. As musical technology and formats have changed, so too have preferences. In the 2010 calendar year, Australians bought 33m CD albums. By 2020, the number had dropped to 3.3m – one-tenth of the value it was 10 years ago. In a return to retro, forecasts suggest that in 2021, we probably spent more on vinyl than on CDs. CDs defined the album format. A CD can fit 74 minutes of content – the length of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. Fans were willing to pay a premium for an album ($20-$30) over a single ($5-$10). Labels and artists designed albums with two to three hopeful hits (which would be spun out in to singles), and a balance of filler tracks. The practice was both common and common sense. Now, of course, there is streaming. According to 2020 figures, streaming represents 89% of total recorded music sales in Australia by value. By all accounts, you’re more likely to see a subscription gift card in your email this year then you are to see a CD wrapped underneath a tree. Artists and labels have adapted accordingly. Under streaming models, music makers get paid every time someone listens to a track – or the first 30 seconds of it. The result is more focus on singles, and shorter track lengths. You could break a three-minute song in to two one-and-a-half minute songs, or three one-minute songs, and get paid double (or triple) as much for your efforts. The other contributor is that streaming provides better access to a wider catalogue. In a physical music store, constraints around distribution and physical space meant that artists were very reliant on labels and networks to get access to consumers. Whether a single or an album, you could only take up shelf space for so long. Music had a short half-life. Online, however, there are few limits. Musicians can reach audiences of millions without labels – a Scottish man singing a Kiwi folk song on a social media platform became the song of a pandemic, with more than 75m views. It’s also enabling access to golden oldies – and increasing focus on them. Older Christmas songs have become increasingly prominent on Spotify charts over the last five years. As an example, consider the most streamed songs in Australia on 20 December from 2017 (the first year Spotify chart data is available) onwards. In 2017, every song in the Top 10 had been released that year. In 2018, Mariah Carey’s 1994 festive hit All I Want for Christmas Is You made the list – and it has featured in the Top 10 every year since. Three out of the Top 10 streamed songs on Spotify in Australia on 20 December 2021 were from previous years. This is not to say that there have been no new contenders. This year, Ed Sheeran, Kelly Clarkson and Megan Thee Stallion have all thrown their hats in to the ring. Yet none have made the Christmas week Top 50. It’s no wonder that festive new releases have declined. Nostalgic Christmas listening is not limited to streaming. Consider the classic crooners making money from beyond the grave. There has been at least one Christmas album release from Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra or Nat King Cole every single year for the last decade. Not bad considering none of them have not seen a Christmas in more than two decades. Source: author calculations based on Allmusic Love them or hate them, Christmas songs are here to stay.

12/24/2021,"A Philippine family set to be deported from New Zealand on Christmas Day after the father used a false address to claim food vouchers out of desperation has been granted a last-minute reprieve in what they described as the “best present”. Jeffrey Santos had used a false address to claim $1,600 in vouchers because he lost his job when the Covid lockdown struck in March 2020 and was ineligible for New Zealand’s income relief payment, which wasn’t available to migrant workers. As a result, Jeffrey, his wife, Marjorie, and 8-year-old son James were to be deported back to the Philippines on Christmas Day.  “I couldn’t pay rent for two weeks, I had to do something,” Santos told Stuff on Thursday. “I wish I hadn’t done this, but it is too late.” Except it wasn’t. In a reversal which Green MP Ricardo Menéndez March described as a “Christmas miracle”, Santos has been granted a 12-month work visa after an outpouring of anger from New Zealanders. “This is the best present I have ever seen,” said Santos. “This is the first time in our lives we have got a big present!” He said he had invited his son’s two best friends to come round to their house for a Christmas party after hearing the news. “Right now we’re having a Christmas celebration. We’ll sort everything else out later on.” Santos’ current boss Anita Brodie heard the news partway through a call with the Guardian. “Everyone knows that what he did was wrong, but he was absolutely desperate and took the only option available to him,” she said, before pausing. “Oh, this is Jeffrey now. Just give me one second.” After a few moments, Brodie began to shout. “Are you serious? Are you serious Jeffrey? That’s incredible! I’m so happy for you!” When New Zealand went into lockdown last year, Santos – a carpenter – lost his job. By April 2020 his family were struggling financially, prompting him apply for food vouchers using a false Queenstown address. Santos took full responsibility for his actions and has repeatedly apologised. Wonderful news - Santos deportation flight has been cancelled & Jeff Santos has a 12 month work visa.Thank you to @RMarchNZ for his work on this, the media who picked this up, Ministers who made the right decision, & everyone who wrote in and tweeted.Popular pressure works. https://t.co/aUieiNEwf1 The turnaround in the Santos’ case came after news of their deportation prompted outrage around New Zealand. Max Harris, a Rhodes scholar and left-wing writer, said that when he read about the situation on Thursday he immediately knew it was “unduly harsh” since “the family couldn’t pay rent, couldn’t receive the wage subsidy or the income relief payment and in the Philippines hospitals have been overwhelmed by Covid.” Harris and others began organising a social media campaign encouraging people to write to immigration minister Kris Faafoi urging him to exercise discretion and allow the Santos family to stay. Hundreds of people did so. Jeffrey’s previous appeals had won support from Menéndez March, a former anti-poverty activist, and advocacy group Migrante Aotearoa. But the appeals failed after Immigration New Zealand decided the family did not have “exceptional humanitarian circumstances”. By Thursday Santos had exhausted his normal rights of appeal. But on Friday, under significant public pressure, associate immigration minister Phil Twyford – who initially refused Santos’ appeal – intervened. Although he is relieved the Santos family won’t be deported, Menéndez March says their case illustrates wider difficulties with New Zealand’s treatment of migrant workers. “What Jeffrey and his family went through was a direct result of government decisions which meant that migrant workers didn’t have adequate income support systems during an incredibly challenging time … Santos did what I think many parents would have done, which is to find any avenue possible to feed your child. Santos’ survival was effectively criminalised.” “At all stages of the way, we’ve chosen not to support migrant communities. This decision illustrates those systemic failures. While I’m elated about the individual outcome, I hope this serves as a call to action for government to address those barriers for migrants so they have access to a life with dignity.” Immigration New Zealand has been approached for comment.",News/World news,Family set to be deported from New Zealand on Christmas Day given last-minute reprieve,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/24/family-set-to-be-deported-from-new-zealand-on-christmas-day-given-last-minute-reprieve
