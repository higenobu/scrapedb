4/18/2022,"Kandis R. Majors and Terri Ann Seibeck found in each other a loving and supportive partner. Life hadn’t been easy for the two single mothers from West Frankfort, Illinois. “Kandis had a beautiful smile that lit up the room when she walked in. She had so many positive things going for her.” Majors’ mother, Cindy Marlow, told “Snapped: Killer Couples,” airing Sundays at 6/5c on Oxygen. Majors went through tough times, though. Hoping to turn her life around, Majors befriended Seibeck, who had faced many of the same challenges. She too had had gone through similar issues and had no family to fall back on. “I think they needed each other just because they had issues with past drug addictions, trauma, they both wanted to get on a better path and do good for their kids,” friend Jessi Hurley told “Killer Couples.” Majors and Seibeck supported each other’s sobriety and moved in together in 2007. Seibeck worked for her father’s painting business while Majors was training to become a radiologist. Things were turning around for them both. “Kandis and Terri had talked to me on many occasions about how much in love they were and they did have future plans to get married,” said Hurley. On October 19, 2009, Seibeck’s aunt called 911. Seibeck had missed work and no one could get in touch with her or Majora. Seibeck’s aunt owned the house where the couple lived and went to the property. She saw the front door was covered in blood and waited for officers from the West Frankfort Police Department to arrive. “As I pushed the door open approximately five, six inches, toes came beneath the door and you could see the blood on them,” former West Frankfort Police Chief Jeff Tharp told ""Killer Couples."" Inside the home were the dead bodies of Majors, 28, and Seibeck, 32. An autopsy determined they were shot in the head multiple times at close range by a small-caliber handgun, according to Cape Girardeau Missouri, CBS-affiliate KFVS. Both victims’ credit cards and IDs were missing as was Seibeck’s Chevrolet Impala. However, there were no signs of a break-in and other valuables were left behind. In speaking with the women’s friends, detectives learned another couple had been living with them. They were identified as Afton Ferris, 19, and Michael Schallert, 29.       Detectives learned that Majors and Seibeck had accused Ferris and Schallert of stealing from them and kicked them out on October 18. They then stayed with a friend, who told police the couple left in the middle of the night and stole his .22 Ruger handgun, according to local newspaper the Benton Evening News.  A day after the murder, Afton D. Ferris and Michael Anthony Schallert were named as “persons of interest” in the murder of Kandis Majors and Terri Seibeck, reported KFVS.  In speaking with Schallert’s family, they learned his friendship with Seibeck went back years. They found it hard to believe he was behind such brutal acts of violence.  Born in 1979, Schallert grew up in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He became a father at 15, which forever altered the course of his life.  As an adult, Schallert drifted around the Midwest, working odd jobs and moving from place to place. He met Seibeck in West Frankfort and she allowed him to stay with her for a period. Schallert returned to Cheyenne in 2008, where he met Ferris, then 18. She had grown up in foster care, and despite being valedictorian of her high school, was unable to hold down a job. She was homeless when they met.   Michael Schallert and Afton Ferris  “He did become kind of obsessed with Afton. It wasn’t necessarily an obsession, like, a crazy obsession, it was, ‘I will do anything I have to for this person for them to love me,'” sister Shauna Schallert told “Killer Couples."" Michael Schallert asked Shauna if Ferris could move in with her. Having just given birth to a young child, Shauna refused, so the couple made their way back to West Frankfort.  Seibeck allowed Ferris and Schallert to stay in the home she shared with Majors. However, the situation soon went south. “About a month after they moved in, I spoke with Terri on the phone and she just seemed really frustrated saying some of their things had come up missing,” Hurley said. “She told me that no one else had been in the house."" Believing Ferris and Schallert were stealing from them, Seibeck and Majors kicked the couple out. Less than 24 hours later, they were dead.  Investigators soon obtained security camera footage from a local gas station that showed Schallert filling up Seibeck’s car and paying for it with Majors’ credit card, according to the Benton Evening News. Activity on Majors’ credit card helped investigators track the couple to Larimer County, Colorado. They learned Schallert had a friend who lived in a trailer park in Fort Collins and spotted Seibeck’s car parked outside.  Afton Ferris and Michael Schallert were taken into custody on October 21, 2009. Insider the the trailer, authorities found blood-stained clothing belonging to Ferris, stolen credit cards, and a black purse containing the murder weapon, according to KFVS.  A handwritten poem titled ""Bullets and Weed"" was found inside Majors’ car, which was signed by Ferris, according to WFVS. ""Seems like we got no where to run to, and no way to go back,” it reads “Guess the only way to go, is to take this handful of bullets and pocketful of weed.”  Another note found inside the car read, ""We are sorry we did this, I wish we hadn't done this, but we had been pushed too far. Terri & Kandice were thieves and liars & they continuously stole from one another & blamed it on somebody else, and we continuously got the blame,"" according to WFVS. In her interview with police, Ferris admitted to stealing the murder weapon. She said they originally intended to rob Seibeck and Majors but when they got to their house decided to kill them.  “We didn’t have any other choice,” Ferris says in footage of her interview with police, which was obtained by “Killer Couples.” “It was the only option we had.” Ferris said that in order to gain entrance into the home, Schallert said they wanted to apologize. Instead, he gunned the women down in cold blood. “He’s like, ‘You know what, motherf--ker?’ and he shot [Majors] and she went backwards, and then he shot Terri. She hit the coffee table,” said Ferris. She said she saw Majors was attempting to escape and call the sheriff's department, so she grabbed her and brought her back in, while Schallert shot her again. “Terri, she was moaning and groaning and I told him, ‘Give me the gun,’ and I shot her in her left eye,” Ferris then told detectives.  In his interview with police, Schallert admitted to murdering Seibeck and Majors with Ferris’ help. He said he and Ferris were planning to die by suicide, according to WFVS.  “We just walked in and she started blaming Afton for stealing some CDs and me for a tank top shirt and I just couldn’t take it no more and I had that gun. I just pulled the trigger, I don’t even know how many times,” Schallert says in his videotaped police interview, which was obtained by “Snapped.” “Then it got jammed and Afton told me to reload it. I reloaded it and she shot a couple times."" Following their confessions, Afton Ferris and Michael Schallert were charged with two counts each of murder in the first degree, according to The Denver Post newspaper.  In August 2011, Michael Schallert pleaded guilty to two counts of murder in the first degree and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, reported Southern Illinois’ Harrisburg Register newspaper.  A jury found Afton Ferris guilty on two counts each of murder, home invasion, and armed robbery in July 2011. She was subsequently sentenced to natural life without the possibility of parole, according to the Benton Evening News.

4/18/2022,"Rattlesnake catchers don’t like surprises, but that’s what happened to Marissa Maki when she started poking around a cactus. Venomous snakes had been seen in an Arizona family’s yard, and video shows Maki found them in a most unexpected way. She stuck a pair of tongs deep into a pink cactus and pulled the tool out seconds later with two very excited snakes writhing from the grip. They were western diamondback rattlesnakes, each one nearly 3 feet long. Maki was surprised, but she kept her head, the video shows. “I thought I had just one and then I somehow got both the snakes. It was pretty awesome,” Maki told McClatchy News. “I’ve never done that before and I was excited. I wish I could say I planned that, but it was pure accident.” Video of her “double grab” has been viewed more than 7,200 times since being posted by Maki’s employer, Rattlesnake Solutions, an Arizona-based snake relocation service. Some have called it more “crazy” than cool, given Maki was dodging two sets of fangs at once. It happened March 23 in the Gold Canyon area southeast of Phoenix. The homeowners had reported seeing rattlesnakes in the front yard, calling Rattlesnake Solutions out of fear the reptiles would eventually encounter their recently acquired puppy. Western diamondback rattlesnakes live to 20 years and average 3 to 5 feet in Arizona, though some have been known to reach 7 feet, according to the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. The two snakes Maki caught were happily coiled up at the base of the cactus and clearly annoyed (lots of rattlings) when Maki interrupted their quality time. They were placed in a bucket together and eventually relocated to a large pack rat nest in the desert, which is standard procedure for Rattlesnake Solutions. The company captured and relocated 1,500 snakes last year and expects to do “slightly more” this year.

4/18/2022,"The ruling Guinean military junta's determination to increase revenues from its bauxite and iron ore resources could hit China's efforts to make inroads into the West African nation. Despite assurances that the military would respect ""existing regulations, contracts and investments"" after Alpha Conde was removed as president in a coup in September, Guinea has been exerting more pressure on foreign mining firms. Most recently, it ordered foreign companies to construct local bauxite refineries and in March suspended operations at Simandou, the country's largest iron ore deposit. Chinese companies have vast investments in Guinea, which is the world's second largest producer of bauxite, a mineral used to make aluminium. About half of China's bauxite imports are from Guinea. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Simandou is one of the world's largest undeveloped iron ore deposits, and China sees the site as a source to help reduce its reliance on supplies from Australia. The Simandou project is Guinea's largest iron ore deposit. Photo: Rio Tinto alt=The Simandou project is Guinea's largest iron ore deposit. Photo: Rio Tinto> But Guinea's military rulers have toughened their stance towards multinationals, saying they want the country to earn more from its mineral resources. Last week, the junta ordered mining companies to present proposals and a timetable for the construction of refineries to convert bauxite into alumina within Guinea by the end of May. ""Despite the mining boom in the bauxite sector, we have to admit that the expected revenues are below expectations, and you and we cannot continue this game of fools that perpetuates great inequality in our relations,"" junta leader Mamady Doumbouya said in a meeting with stakeholders in Conakry. Without providing specifics, Doumbouya warned that ""penalties"" would follow if the mining companies failed to meet the deadline. Bauxite miners have reportedly committed to developing refineries in the country, but not much has progressed. Anthony Everiss, a senior aluminium analyst at the commodities consultancy CRU Group, said Guinean leaders had been seeking ways to turn the nation's mineral wealth into a means of economic development. He said the junta's move comes at a time when Guinea's bauxite shipments to China are at an all-time high, surpassing six million tonnes in a single month for the first time. However, there currently was just one alumina refinery in operation, and it was built several decades ago, Everiss said. The announcement ""is the first time Guinea's junta has shown its hand and is the strongest sign of intent yet that [it] is determined to pursue its policy of resource nationalism"", Everiss said. ""Guinea is now much more aware of the value of their resources"" and has better control of the mining industry and exports, he said. CRU does not expect a greenfield alumina refinery to be built in Guinea before 2026. Technical limitations and higher capital costs in Guinea versus China may lead to disappointment in the government's expectations, it said. Map: SCMP alt=Map: SCMP> The consultancy estimates that six companies have planned 11 million tonnes per year of alumina refining capacity in Guinea. But unlike the significant progress in bauxite mining, movement on alumina refineries has been slow. Only the project by Societe Miniere de Boke (SMB) has made some progress; all others are in early stages. Chinese firms including Chalco Guinea, Jinjiang Group Guinea, TBEA Guinea, Henan International Guinea and Zibo Rundi Guinea are in the early investment stage. However, analysts say it is unclear if this would have an immediate impact. ""Presentation of plans would not automatically translate to aluminium production,"" said W. Gyude Moore, a senior policy fellow with the Centre for Global Development and a former Liberian public works minister. He said most African governments harboured ambitions of moving up the value chain of their mineral exports, so the junta's announcement ""is not surprising"". Bauxite is not the only resource for which Guinea wants more royalties. The junta said that work at the Simandou iron ore project, where operations were suspended last month, had not progressed and that it was not clear how the mine contributed to national interests. The project has been hit by delays because of years of ownership disputes and slow progress on the 650km (400-mile) railway needed to transport the ore to Guinean ports. Simandou is divided into four blocks with an estimated 2 billion tonnes in commercial-scale, high-grade reserves. Anglo-Australian multinational Rio Tinto owns 45 per cent of Blocks 3 and 4; Aluminum Corp of China, or Chinalco, holds 40 per cent; and Guinea's government has the remaining 15 per cent. Blocks 1 and 2 were awarded in 2019 to SMB, a consortium formed by Singaporean shipowner Winning Shipping, Chinese aluminium producer Shandong Weiqiao, the Yantai Port Group and the Guinean transport and logistics company United Mining Supply. Australia supplies about 60 per cent of China's iron ore imports, but ties between the two countries have been strained since Canberra called for an international investigation into the origin of the coronavirus and banned China's Huawei Technologies from its 5G network.

Photo: Reuters> That dependence has been driven home in recent weeks with sanctions on Russia driving up the price of commodities, including Australian iron ore. Lauren A. Johnston, a visiting senior lecturer at the University of Adelaide, said the Guinean leaders were ""simply taking advantage of contemporary global tensions and supply chain fears to get a better deal for Guinea"". ""Remember that countries like Morocco are gaining aspects of supply chain production that is moving from Ukraine. I guess Guineans also want to join the upgrade opportunism, as much as nationalism strictly. I think they are just thinking it's a good time to go for a marginally better deal for them,"" Johnston said. She said Chinese companies had always been relatively happy to move in the direction of local industrialisation. ""This may be less true in terms of minerals processing - they have such scale at home it would be hard to compete,"" Johnston said.
