3/7/2022,"When an anonymous Black person enters the white space, often the people there immediately try to make sense of him or her – to determine “who that is”, or to figure out the nature of the person’s business and whether they need to be concerned. When the Black person is unknown, stereotypes can rule perceptions, creating a situation that can estrange the Black person. In these circumstances, almost any Black person can experience distance, especially a young Black male – not as a measure of his merit as a person but because of his Black skin and its indication of “outsider” status in the white space. Thus, such a Black person is burdened with a deficit of credibility, especially in comparison with their white counterparts. Strikingly, a Black person’s deficit may be minimized or tentatively overcome by a performance, a negotiation, or what some Blacks refer to derisively as a “dance”, through which individual Blacks may be inclined to show white people and others that ghetto stereotypes do not apply to them personally; in effect, they perform for credibility or for acceptance. This performance can be as deliberate as dressing well and speaking in an educated way or as simple as producing an ID or a driver’s license in situations in which this would never be demanded of whites. Almost by definition, the Black person performs before a distant, judgmental, and unsympathetic audience of gatekeepers – distant because of the extant racial divide, and judgmental and unsympathetic because their minds are typically already made up about the Black person’s “place” and the threat they believe he or she poses to the white space, and perhaps to some of the people standing in judgment. Depending on how effectively the Black person performs or negotiates, he may “pass inspection”. But there are no guarantees, for some members of the audience are inclined at times to weaponize their prejudices, to put the Black person in their “place”. Moreover, others in the white space may require additional proof on demand. In public white spaces, such as upscale shops or restaurants, many Black people take this sort of racial profiling in stride; they expect it, treat it as a fact of life, and try to go on about their business, hoping to move through the world uneventfully. And most often, with the help of social gloss to ease their passage, they do so; however, on occasion they experience blatant discrimination, which may leave them deflated and offended, and which they cannot ignore. White salesmen, security guards, and bouncers repeatedly approach Black people with a disingenuous question: “Can I help you?” The tone of voice and the circumstances belie a true offer of help and define the situation as slightly ominous. A young Black person hears the question as “What is your business here?” Most defenders of such spaces prefer to be more indirect in their challenges and queries to avoid offending the Black person or incurring lawsuits. When the anonymous Black person can demonstrate that he or she has business in the white space, by producing an ID card or simply passing an initial inspection, the defending “agents” or gatekeepers may relax their guard, at least for the time being. The Black person may then advance from a deficit of credibility to a provisional status, suggesting a conditional “pass”, with the person having something “more to prove”. But as the iconic ghetto hovers overhead, this social plateau simply leads to further evaluations that typically have little to do with the Black person’s essential merit as a person and everything to do with his or her Blackness and what it has come to mean in the white space. When venturing into or navigating the white space, Black people endure such challenges repeatedly. In white neighborhoods, Black people may anticipate such profiling or harassment by the neighborhood watch group, whose mission is to monitor the “suspicious-looking”. Any anonymous Black male can qualify for close scrutiny, especially under the cover of darkness. Defensive whites in these circumstances may be less consciously hateful than concerned and fearful of “dangerous and violent” Black people. In the minds of many of their detractors, to scrutinize and stop Black people is to prevent crime and protect the neighborhood. Thus, for the Black person, particularly young males, virtually every public encounter results in a degree of scrutiny that a “normal” white person would certainly not need to endure. A more subtle but critical version of this kind of profiling occurs in the typical workplace. From the janitor to a middle-level manager, Black people, until they have established themselves, live under the tyranny of the command performance. Around the office building, the Black male worker comes to be known publicly as “the Black guy in my building”, and if there are a few such “Black guys” working there who “roam” the premises, white workers at times confuse one with another, occasionally misidentifying the person by name. Given such racial ambiguity, the string of white people standing in line to witness the Black person’s performance, or “dance”, may encourage those who were once approving or convinced to demand an encore. Thus, as long as the Black person is present in the white space, he or she is likely to be “on”, performing before a highly judgmental but distant audience. Probably, the most important finding of my new book, Black in White Space, is my conception of the “iconic ghetto”, that netherworld to which white people typically relegate anonymous Black people in public places, and especially in “white space”. In civil society, this iconic ghetto hovers over the anonymous Black person; always in the background of the most ordinary public encounters between the races, during which Black people are burdened with a deficit of credibility that they are required to disprove, erase, or neutralize before gaining even provisional trust with their white counterparts. Moreover, white people typically avoid Black spaces, but Black people must navigate white spaces as a condition of their existence. Black people now inhabit all levels of the class and occupational structure. They attend the best schools, pursue the professions of their choosing, and occupy various positions of power, privilege, and prestige. But for these people, in the shadows lurks the specter of the iconic ghetto – it is always in the background, shaping the dominant white society’s conception of the anonymous Black person as well as the circumstances of Black people in all walks of life.

3/7/2022,"Kanye West has addressed the backlash in response to a new music video in which a figurine of the rapper kidnaps, buries and decapitates a model of the comedian Pete Davidson. Davidson, a Saturday Night Live cast member, is currently dating West’s ex-wife, Kim Kardashian West, who was legally declared single last week despite West’s high-profile attempts to prevent their split being formalised and to bring their family “back together”. She is pursuing divorce, citing “irreconcilable differences”. In the claymation video for Eazy, from West’s new album, Donda 2, the West character assaults Davidson and the clip ends with title cards that read: “Everyone lived happily ever after, except Skete you know who – JK he’s fine.” The track also includes the lyrics: “God saved me from that crash / Just so I can beat Pete Davidson’s ass.” Apparently in response to the backlash, West, now legally known as Ye, posted an image of a burning church on Instagram with the caption: Art is therapy just like this view art is protected as freedom of speech art inspires and simplifies the world Art is not a proxy for any ill or harm Any suggestion otherwise about my art is false and mal intended Eazy is not the only new West song to reference the comedian. In City of Gods, he suggests that Davidson should “thank” him for letting him “have” Kardashian. In the song Security, he warns Davidson: “Never stand between a man and his kids / Y’all ain’t got enough security for this.” The rapper has also ostracised former friends for maintaining relationships with Davidson, offered his SNL colleague Michael Che “double” his earnings from the show to avoid working with him, shared memes that pit himself and Davidson on opposing sides of a Marvel-style “civil war” and impugned Davidson’s conduct in prior relationships. In late February, Kardashian West asked to fast-track the couple’s divorce in accordance with a prenuptial agreement, telling the court that West had disrespected her wish to keep their split private and that he had shared “misinformation regarding our private family matters and co-parenting on social media which has created emotional distress”. Her request referenced since-deleted social media posts by West including one in which he targeted Davidson, instructing his fans to “look at this dickhead”. West responded via a lawyer. He said the social media posts were not attached to her court declaration, called her allegations “double hearsay” and questioned the validity of their prenuptial agreement.

3/7/2022,"Just one goal Vivianne? A mere 25% of your team’s total production this weekend? Yes, the Dutch forward only scored once in the 4-2 win against Birmingham on Sunday, making the most of a loose ball in Birmingham’s pinball penalty box. She made it look simple and Miedema most likely puts dozens of those away in training, probably without looking. It is sometimes difficult to put in context just how good she is but one way to illustrate it is that the goal made her the first player in WSL history to reach 100 goal involvements What if we were to also say that the numbers were serenely shaped in the form of 70 goals and 30 assists, and in just 83 appearances? If you already knew this, you’re probably an Arsenal fan. For the rest of us, it might be easier to start betting on what she can’t do.

The captain is a dependable set-piece taker and was back in the role as she stepped up to take corners. She smacked the ball straight into the net from the set-piece – not once, but twice in four minutes. The goals were almost identical with Zelem taking the kick from the left hand side with the ball bending into the bottom right of the goal. It means Zelem’s last three goals have all been scored directly from a corner, with her sublime technique also having been seen in United’s 4-1 FA Cup loss to Manchester City. To make matters even sweeter, the two goals came in United’s 100th competitive match.

However, it is perhaps the change in position for the defender Alex Greenwood, who was shifted from left-back to centre-back in the course of the season-crippling injury crisis, that is most remarkable. Across the pitch the ship has been steadied, allowing players playing out of position out of necessity to be shifted back to more familiar waters. At centre-back though, with Steph Houghton out again, Greenwood has shone and in the process gone from a maybe for England to a starter. Chelsea, in the first Cup final between the two teams, was a big test and Greenwood coped excellently with the threat of Sam Kerr and Pernille Harder. Gareth Taylor will be looking forward to the resumption of their WSL duties.

She was presented with a framed shirt by her manager, Kelly Chambers, and celebrated the milestone with a massively impressive performance. The Republic of Ireland international saved brilliantly from Ria Percival and Ashleigh Neville, demonstrating why the keeper has been such a mainstay and why she will continue to add to the tally. The club’s post on Twitter about the feat summed up their love for the keeper: “A special day for our special number one.” A special player indeed. SR Oh, to be a fly on the wall in the Aston Villa camp. Or perhaps a Seagull, circling at the opportunity of only a second win on the road this year. Because that is exactly what happened at the weekend for Hope Powell’s Brighton side, who emerged victorious against a Villa team tasting their eighth defeat in 10 games. The only goal of the game came in the 28th minute via a sizzling corner from Megan Connolly that set up Maya Le Tissier to steer it home. Villa did have opportunities to hit back, especially through Alisha Lehmann, but spurned their chances. That has been a running theme of their recent, difficult streak and it is not going to be much easier at the weekend when they face the reigning WSL champions Chelsea.

3/7/2022,"The actor Taron Egerton has said he will return to the stage “with a vengeance” on Monday night after he fainted during the first performance of his West End debut in the play Cock by Mike Bartlett. Egerton, best known for his screen role as Elton John in Rocketman, passed out on stage towards the end of the preview on Saturday night at the Ambassadors theatre. A doctor in the audience attended to the actor and it was decided that his understudy, Joel Harper-Jackson, should replace him for the remainder of the show. “I am completely fine,” Egerton posted online on Sunday. “Slightly sore neck and a bruised ego but I’m fine. I’ve decided to put a positive spin on it and I would appreciate it if anyone who was in the theatre last night just said that I gave such a committed, electrifying performance that my body couldn’t handle it and checked out. That being said, apparently you’re meant to actually do the full show and not just three-quarters of it. So I’ll be back with a vengeance tomorrow night.” Egerton praised his co-stars and the rest of the production team and called Harper-Jackson “an amazing actor and a lovely person”. Harper-Jackson tweeted on Sunday that it had been “an absolute privilege” to step in for the star. He continued: “Taron is a true gentleman, has been so supportive and most importantly he’s OK and will be back on Monday.” In Bartlett’s comic play, Egerton plays M whose boyfriend John (Bridgerton’s Jonathan Bailey) falls in love with W (Jade Anouka). Harper-Jackson understudies both John and M. The cast is completed by Phil Daniels. Cock was first staged at the Theatre Upstairs at the Royal Court in London in 2009. The new West End production, which runs for 12 weeks, is directed by Marianne Elliott who, while appearing on stage at the first preview, said that Bartlett’s “wild, wonderful words” were “theatre in its truest form” and took the actors and the audience on an “imaginative journey”.",Arts/Stage,Taron Egerton to return ‘with a vengeance’ after fainting during West End debut,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/07/taron-egerton-to-return-with-a-vengeance-after-fainting-during-west-end-debut
3/7/2022,"My father, Gerard Byrne, who has died aged 83, had a wide range of jobs – from joiner to recycling officer – and an even wider range of hobbies and skills, ranging from woodworking to dressmaking and golf to snooker. Born in Liverpool to John, a labourer, and Elizabeth (nee Lally), Gerry was brought up in the Scotland Road area of the city with two sisters, Elizabeth and Frances, and a brother, John. After spending some of the second world war years in care, he received a scholarship to St Francis Xavier’s college, but remembered the teachers resenting the scholarship children, so that one-by-one they all dropped out until Gerry, the last in his year, also left early. As a result, Gerry’s working life started at 15, in a cafe on the Liverpool Dock Road. However, he soon took on an apprenticeship in joinery and over the years went on to do a variety of jobs, including as a salesman, building contractor, local government officer and, in his later years, recycling officer for Merseyside Waste Disposal Authority. Outside work he took on many roles in the local Catholic church, giving his time and expertise generously. In 1961, after two years of national service, mainly in Germany, Gerry married Geraldine Monaghan, and they went to live with Geraldine’s extended family in Greasby, Wirral. Their first child, Gerard, was born in 1965, and two years later they moved into their own place three houses down the street, where they essentially lived for the rest of their lives, and where three more children, Charles, Kevin and me, were born. Our childhoods were filled with a love of knowledge and debate fostered by our father. Thanks to his support and encouragement, all four of us went to university, the first people in our families to do so. A man of fierce intelligence, he would have made great use of higher education himself had the opportunity not been denied to him by the social strictures of his era. Gerry retired in 2000 to look after our mother, who died the following year. He is survived by his four children and 13 grandchildren.",News/UK news,Gerard Byrne obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/07/gerard-byrne-obituary
3/7/2022,"The US beef industry has escaped “relatively unscathed” from Joe Biden’s attempts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, according to leaders at the industry’s recent CattleCon convention. Biden and the EU unveiled a global pledge to cut methane gas 30% by 2030 at November’s Cop26 climate summit – and there is evidence that methane created by cattle production is a significant contributor to climate change. But those at the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA) annual trade show in Houston last month heard industry leaders express relief about the administration choosing to incentivize rather than force ranchers and feedlots to reduce emissions. Mary-Thomas Hart, NCBA’s environmental counsel, told a sustainability forum at the conference how lucky the industry was with the administration’s approach, according to information obtained by Unearthed, Greenpeace’s investigations project, and shared with the Guardian. “A good example is, during Cop26, the president led a global methane pledge, and that could have gone really badly for livestock production in the United States, could have gone badly for the cattle industry,” Hart told her audience. “But this administration seems to have recognized the positive value we bring. We were really excited to get out of that relatively unscathed.” Methane, expelled by cows and by their manure, is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Although methane dissipates after 10 to 20 years, it warms the planet at 80 times the rate of carbon dioxide and emissions are accelerating at an unprecedented rate, according to the UN. Although Biden’s November pledge to reduce methane included new rules for the oil, gas and coal industries, it proposed only voluntary actions for an agricultural sector the Environmental Protection Agency says contributes more than one-third of the country’s emissions. In a November interview with Reuters, agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack said he trusted the agriculture industry to do the right thing in response to federal incentives. “Agriculture will respond to this because they have historically responded to financial and market incentives,” Vilsack said in that interview. “They appreciate the time has come.” Some in Houston made that appreciation clear, with at least one speaker telling the trade show audience that the beef industry stands to make a lot of money off federal emissions-reduction incentives. New rules would stifle an industry that is already working hard to fight climate change, Hart told the trade show audience. “The last thing we need to do is implement regulations. They’d get in the way of that productivity,” Hart said. “Global beef demand isn’t going away. If US cow producers aren’t allowed to do their job and do it well, that production’s just going to go to a less sustainable country.” Some cattle producers are making an effort to reduce emissions, such as feeding animals grass or other lower-emission materials, but the United States will never meet Biden’s 2030 greenhouse gas reduction goals without regulation, said Brent Kim, a program officer with the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future. “We urgently need to curb greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, of which livestock is the biggest producer,” Kim said. “We can’t have business as usual.” The NCBA declined a request to comment. The beef association has pledged to reach “climate neutrality” by 2040 and said in Houston it was on track to reach that goal. But the group’s leaders also said that benchmark should be measured using a scale critics say obscures beef’s role in climate change. At the Houston meeting, NCBA’s CEO Colin Woodall again noted the importance of getting policymakers on board with the contentious global warming potential measurement, called GWP*, which measures changes in greenhouse gases rather than focusing on steady sources such as cattle. The star refers to the new metric for calculating the impact of methane emissions on global heating, which has not been accepted by all. “For us to be successful. GWP* – global warming potential star – is the methodology we need to make sure that everybody is utilizing in order to tell the true story of methane,” Woodall said. “And that’s one of the reasons why NCBA spends time on Capitol Hill making sure that our government recognizes it.” Some experts said GWP* might have merit as one of many ways to measure greenhouse gas emissions, but using it to justify a lack of regulation is questionable. “I’m not throwing shade on it,” Kim said. “I think it’s helpful to have all these different ways of measurement. But it does paint beef as more reasonable.” No other country has accepted GWP* as a way of regulating the beef industry, said Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist. “They don’t get a free pass by messing about with the metrics,” Parr said. “It’s pretty obvious that they’re sort of leaping on the opportunity to get a free pass as an industry from taking more responsibility for their emissions.” The federal government can’t allow the beef industry to run amok, said Cathy Day, the climate policy coordinator for the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition. Voluntary actions and incentives will not be enough to slow climate change, she said. “There’s zero action by the federal government to crack down on methane emissions in the cattle industry,” Day said. “There isn’t a lot of interest in anything that would restrict the way they do business.”",News/Environment,US beef industry emerges from Biden’s climate pledges ‘relatively unscathed’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/07/us-beef-industry-cop26-methane-gas
3/7/2022,"Driving, jogging, dancing, convincing … Starting from cold is rarely a good idea. Except in some cooking, and especially olive oil in a pan. And especially for someone like me, who for years often began cooking by plonking a frying pan on a flame, pouring in olive oil, adding chopped garlic or soffritto, then marvelling as the little bits seized like cotton in a flame and turned into bitter crisps. Even when I tried to be cautious, lowering the flame and my eyes, there was still a good chance of burned edges. And it always felt like a race. The solution arrived like an airdrop; two words, from the cook and teacher Fabrizia Lanza. Start cold. That is, put the oil, garlic, chilli and zest in the pan away from the heat, away from the stove, on the other side of the room, if need be. Because, of course, it isn’t really cold, but room and hand temperature – ideal for getting things started, a pre-warm-up warm-up, if you like. Only when all the elements are ready, and you have put a pan of water on for the pasta, does the pan go on a low flame. In the case of today’s recipe for linguine with white fish and citrus, a really low flame. The lowest of the low, so the volatile oils and scents in a clove of garlic (peeled and crushed gently with the flat of a knife), a small dried red chilli or pinch of dried red chilli flakes and the freshly grated zest of an unwaxed lemon and an orange can infuse six tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil and the room. And this is the heart of the recipe done; all that’s left is to chop the parsley and white fish, cook the pasta and bring it all together. But which white fish? A good and a tricky question. And it is good that it is a tricky question (or what Hattie Ellis called “chewy questions” in her brilliant book What To Eat), because tricky questions are the way to answers – from shops, supermarkets, fishmongers and online providers, we hope. The Marine Conservation Society’s Good Fish Guide, which offers sustainability ratings on 130 species, is a good place to prepare before you go shopping. Ratings are reviewed, so consult regularly. At the time of writing, Arctic char, wild-caught Alaskan pollock, wild-caught Atlantic cod and hake are all rated green, meaning they are good choices. They are all also suitable for this recipe, in which the fish is chopped small enough to cook in the heat of the scented oil, pasta and the pan, with the help of added pasta cooking water. So, after a slow, cold start, it is a hot, fast finish – and a swish, which brings everything together. Serve immediately. This recipe is inspired by a Sicilian-owned trattoria in Rome called Da Salvo, which has a glass panel allowing you to see into the kitchen, so as you eat your fried anchovies, you can watch Salvo in his chef’s toque jolting the pasta pan in a tidal wave movement. For many years I thought this was reserved for chefs in restaurants, until I got myself a suitable pan, large and with high sides, and had a go, which is almost always a good idea. Prep 10 minCook 10 minServes 4 6 tbsp olive oil1 unwaxed orange, zested1 unwaxed lemon, juiced and zested1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed gently with the flat of a knife1 small dried red chilli, crumbled, or a pinch of dried red chilli flakesSalt and black pepper450g linguine300g white fish, cut into 2cm cubes1 heaped tbsp flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped Bring a large pan of water to boil for the pasta. Put the oil in a large, deep frying pan, away from the heat. Using the fine side of a box grater or microplane, grate the zest from the orange and lemon directly into the oil. Add the garlic and chilli. Put the pan on the lowest flame you can – you want the flavours to infuse the oil very slowly. Meanwhile, add salt to the boiling water, stir, add the pasta and set the timer for two minutes less than the recommended cooking time. When the timer rings, lift out a cupful of pasta cooking water and set aside, then, using tongs, lift out the pasta on to the oil. Working fast, raise the heat and swish and stir the pasta for 30 seconds. Add the fish, lemon juice, parsley and some of the pasta cooking water, then stir and swish vigorously for another minute, with the aim of cooking the fish and creating a creamy sauce as the citrus oil meets the lemon meets the starchy pasta cooking water.

3/7/2022,"My friend Ted West, who has died aged 100, was one of the few Britons – possibly even the only one – to have served in the US Air Force during the second world war. Ted had moved from his native Yorkshire to the US at the age of eight, and in 1943, as a 21-year-old, he enlisted in the US Army Air Corps. After initial training he was assigned to the 8th Air Force, 351st Bomb Group, and was sent to Britain to be stationed at Polebrook airfield in Northamptonshire. He served on a Boeing B17 Flying Fortress as a radio operator and gunner and flew on 28 bombing missions over occupied Europe between April and August 1944. On what proved to be his final mission, his aircraft was hit by enemy fire while flying back over the Netherlands. All 10 crew members bailed out safely, but seven were captured soon after landing and were taken away as prisoners of war. The remaining three – Ted and two colleagues – evaded capture by hiding in a sugar beet field overnight, and were eventually able to make contact with members of the Dutch resistance. They spent six harrowing weeks being smuggled through German-occupied territory in the Netherlands and Belgium as they were hidden in remote farms, given false identification papers and disguised as young farm labourers.Ted finally made it through a fluid battle front, narrowly avoiding being shot by Free Polish troops, and ended up first in Brussels, then Paris, where he was repatriated on 22 September 1944, 45 days after being shot down. During the war years, and even after, Ted never met another serviceman in the US Air Force who had been born in the UK, and in his own modest way felt that he was probably, in that sense, one of a kind. He had been born in Hoyland, South Yorkshire, to Elizabeth (nee Dickenson), a homemaker, and her husband, Charles, a coalminer, and lived there until his parents emigrated to the US in 1930 in search of better employment opportunities. He grew up in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where he went to New Brunswick high school, and then worked in the stock room at the pharmaceuticals company Johnson & Johnson. After the war he returned to his employer, became a management trainee, and over the ensuing years managed production facilities for the company across the world, including in Australia and New Zealand. He finished his 40-year career with the firm as an executive vice-president.In retirement Ted and his wife, Betty (nee Shelton), whom he had married in 1945, divided their time between Florida and New Hampshire. Ted also made numerous trips back to the UK, as well as to the continent, where he reconnected with resistance members who had aided his escape. He always maintained unequivocally that the resistance fighters were the real heroes of his war.Betty predeceased him, as did their son, Edwin. He is survived by their daughter, Barbara, three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.",News/World news,Ted West obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/ted-west-obituary
