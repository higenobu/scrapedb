4/22/2022,"The Australian Diamonds are unaccustomed to having a bare trophy cabinet. Although they hold the Quad Series trophy, it is little comfort after failing to secure Commonwealth Games gold in 2018 and the Netball World Cup in 2019. Even the Constellation Cup (often dubbed the Consolation Cup) is in the hands of New Zealand. The naming of the latest squad this week marks the first step in the journey to refill the trophy cabinet. The 18-player list named on Thursday will later be cut to 12 who will board the plane to Birmingham. It’s not impossible for players outside that 18 to force their way into the final team through outstanding performances in Super Netball, but it would be very unusual. Most likely it will be from these 18 players that coach Stacey Marinkovich needs to find a core with the golden glow about it. The team has its locks of course – captain Liz Watson and vice-captain Steph Wood, as well as the electric Gretel Bueta and defensive stalwart Courtney Bruce. Those players can safely start searching for their passports and trying to remember what happens on an international flight. But in naming the squad on Thursday evening, the selectors spoke about finding something elusive – the invisible threads that weave their way through the team and bring everything together. Someone who brings that enigmatic quality is 28-year-old Super Netball rookie Donnell Wallam, who was brought into the Queensland Firebirds set-up as a late replacement for pregnant shooter Romelda Aiken-George. The Noongar woman from Harvey in Western Australia played a season in the English Super League competition before coming home to Australia for a shot at a Super Netball contract. While she was impressive in her elite netball debut in the UK, the Australian competition is widely regarded as the best in the world and represents a significant step up. Wallam has been able to make that step with relative ease, matching up on some of the world’s best goal keepers during the first five rounds of competition. She is a unique prospect among the other shooters in the squad because she has the ability to play a strong holding game. Since the recent retirements of Caitlin Bassett and Caitlin Thwaites, Australia has favoured a moving circle, where both the goal attack and goal shooter make space for each other and use the whole circle. A holding goal shooter however, dominates the space around the post and the goal attack takes on more of a playmaker role in setting up that space. While a moving circle, if used well, can make it very difficult for opposition defenders, a good holding shooter is often a “get out of jail free” card and gives a team the ability to score quickly. Plenty of tall, holding shooters have been tried over the years in an attempt to uncover the successors to Bassett and Thwaites, but on the whole they have been one dimensional. Players such as Emma Ryde, Kristina Brice and Jane Cook have had stints in Super Netball over the years, but they quickly became illustrations of why height and shooting accuracy isn’t enough to make it in the cutthroat competition. Wallam’s ability to think on her feet, to outfox defenders and work in combination with her teammates elevates her holding skills and makes her a genuine contender at the highest level. Off the court, Wallam’s Noongar roots illustrate the problems that Netball Australia has had with a lack of Indigenous inclusion. This became particularly stark when Jemma Mi Mi – at the time the only Indigenous player in the competition – failed to take the court during Super Netball’s Indigenous Round in 2020. The fact that Wallam becomes only the third Indigenous player to make the Diamonds squad after Sharon Finnan-White and Marcia Ella-Duncan, and the first in over 20 years is conspicuous, especially considering she had to travel to the UK to effectively catch the attention of selectors in Australia. Following her elevation to the national squad on Thursday, Wallam acknowledged the importance of role models and mentors for First Nations women and made plain her desire to be a visible role model for the generations to come. “It’s an incredible achievement and one that I’m just so very proud of,” she said. “I just hope that I can inspire our First Nations athletes to keep following their dreams now, seeing I made the squad. Marcia and Sharon, I just want to thank them for paving the way and pay tribute how I can.” Wallam’s inclusion is an exciting one and the key talking point of this squad, but it can’t completely distract from the questions that arise across other areas of the court. From squad balance – seven shooters have been named compared to five defenders – to midcourt management. Wallam’s teammate at the Firebirds Kim Ravaillion has not been named in the squad since returning to netball after the birth of her first child, despite the fact that she has been in sparkling form for the past two seasons. There has been little given in the way of explanation for her consistent exclusion. Like all Diamonds squads before it, this is a group brimming with talent. Every one of the 18 players named is hard-working and highly accomplished. But Australian netball is not interested in talented players trying their best and falling short. What now needs to be discovered is: who among this group holds the tiny invisible threads that can be woven together to create something golden.",Sport/Sport,Donnell Wallam’s meteoric rise blazes a trail for Indigenous netball | Megan Maurice,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/22/donnell-wallams-meteoric-rise-blazes-a-trail-for-indigenous-netball
4/22/2022,"MasterChef Australia’s Julie Goodwin has opened up about her mental health struggles in the years since winning the show’s inaugural season, saying her anxiety was so bad at one point she “couldn’t set foot in my kitchen” after being admitted to a mental health unit. Goodwin, who is currently a contestant on the show’s Fans v Faves spinoff, spoke on Thursday night’s episode about her life in the 13 years since she won the first season. The 50-year-old has written six cookbooks and runs a cooking school, in addition to appearing on television and radio. She has previously spoken about her depression and anxiety, which she has lived with “on and off over many years” before being put on medication in 2019. In 2020 she was voluntarily hospitalised for five weeks. “I had to do some serious assessment of my mental health and wellbeing … I’d reached a point in my life where I lost my joy,” she said on Thursday night. “I had to give up my job on the radio – I couldn’t do that anymore – and I actually couldn’t set foot in my kitchen.” She said she had worried about returning to television: “I think maybe I have done everything that I was here to do, and I have achieved everything that’s possible for me to achieve … so this for me is an opportunity to see if there’s another chapter. If there’s more.” After winning the first challenge, Goodwin tearfully told judges that “when the phone call came to do this, I didn’t know if I could”. “It’s been a tough couple of years, and I didn’t know if I was able to come back into this environment. My experience last time was that I fell over again and again, and I think I got to the end because every time I fell down I got back up. The phone call to come here was … it was the universe saying ‘It’s time to get back up.’” In 2020, Goodwin wrote a detailed letter to listeners of her radio show to explain her extended absence, sharing her battle with depression and stress, and her subsequent hospitalisation. “On the surface I know I don’t seem to be depressed or anxious. I’ve denied it to myself for a long time, and certainly put a lot of energy into making sure it wasn’t obvious to the people around me,” she wrote. “My beautiful husband Mick, the person who loves me most, recognised the crisis I was in and took me to the emergency room. I was referred to what’s known as the acute care team, who referred me to a psychiatrist, who recommended in-patient care in a mental health unit.” In an interview with Australian Women’s Weekly this month, Goodwin said she had been suicidal during that period. “In the midst of that really awful time I had decided that I was done. I had nothing left to do, my work here was done. That’s where I found myself. That landed me in hospital a bunch of times,” she said. On Thursday, she said her success on Fans v Faves made her feel that “maybe I’m not done. Maybe there’s more for me”. She addressed viewers directly: “Everybody walks their own way through depression or anxiety. But if I had a message to give it would just be, just don’t give up.”  In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

4/22/2022,"A New South Wales independent is threatening to withdraw supply and confidence from the minority state government following comments made by the premier, Dominic Perrottet, about the participation of transgender kids in sport. Sydney MP Alex Greenwich – one of a handful of lower house crossbenchers the Coalition relies on to govern – said he could not have a “cooperative relationship” with the government if the premier continued to make “attacks” on the LGBTI community. Earlier this week, Perrottet said “girls should play sport against girls and women should play sport against women” after the issue erupted when inflammatory comments by federal Liberal Warringah candidate Katherine Deves were made public. High-profile federal and state Liberals, including NSW treasurer Matt Kean, called for Deves to be disendorsed after she apologised for the comments, which included claims that transgender children had been “surgically mutilated”. Greenwich has called on the premier to meet with trans people and with sporting codes to better understand the issues. “I’ve always been transparent with the government and that is, any attacks on the LGBTI community and I could no longer have a cooperative relationship with them,” he told ABC radio. “What I had been dealing with in the past two days is trans kids asking their parents can they still play sport or does the premier not want them to.” He said it was not an issue politicians needed to be involved in and regulation should be left to sporting codes and schools, with people dealt with on a case-by-case basis. “I would like him to meet with trans people, to meet with the sporting codes, to understand that, although this may sound like a really innocent statement, the impact that it is having is profoundly negative,” Greenwich said. The Coalition is governing in minority, with only 45 of the 47 MPs required to govern outright, forcing the government to rely on the crossbench for support in the lower house. During an estimates hearing on Thursday, Greens MP Abigail Boyd said the premier was “on the side of the transphobes”. Perrottet rebuked that his “views are more in line with fair-minded Australians” than Boyd’s. “My personal view is that when it comes to competitive sport, young girls should compete against young girls,” he said. “I’m entitled to my opinion.” Earlier this week, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Deves had “stepped over a line” with some of her comments but refused to disendorse her and said he would not let her be “cancelled” by people who disagreed with her. “She’s made a number of remarks in the past, and on a number of occasions, not in the majority, she’s stepped over the line, and she’s acknowledged that,” Morrison said. “But what I won’t allow, what I won’t allow, is for those who are seeking to cancel Katherine simply because she has a different view to them on the issue of women and girls in sport.” The state government has been contacted for comment.",News/Australia news,NSW MP Alex Greenwich threatens to withdraw supply from Perrottet government over ‘attacks’ on trans kids,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/22/nsw-mp-alex-greenwich-threatens-to-withdraw-supply-from-perrottet-government-over-attacks-on-trans-kids
