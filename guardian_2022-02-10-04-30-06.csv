2/10/2022,"Damon Galgut, who won the Booker last year for his portrait of a white South African family imploding, is now in the running for rival literary award the Rathbones Folio prize. The South African author’s The Promise is one of eight titles in the running for the £30,000 Folio, which was first awarded in 2014 after controversy over comments from the Booker’s judges in 2011. The Booker panel that year had stressed the importance of books that “zip along”, and the Folio subsequently announced its intention to “establish a clear and uncompromising standard of excellence” in the titles it rewarded. Today, the Rathbones Folio is open across genres, to all works of literature written in English, and to English-language writers from around the world, with previous winners including poet Raymond Antrobus, short story writer George Saunders, and memoirist Carmen Maria Machado.  This year’s shortlist features six novels, with The Promise joined by the award-winning Irish writer Colm Tóibín’s fictionalised biography of Thomas Mann, The Magician. Natasha Brown’s debut Assembly, an exploration of identity and class, opens as a Black British woman prepares to attend a garden party at her boyfriend’s family estate, while Sunjeev Sahota’s China Room is the story of a young bride in rural Punjab. Claire Keegan’s Small Things Like These tells of courage and quiet heroism in Catholic Ireland, and Gwendoline Riley’s My Phantoms explores the connection between a semi-estranged mother and daughter. The shortlist is completed with Philip Hoare’s Albert and the Whale, which tackles the intersection between life, art and the sea through the work of Albrecht Dürer, and Selima Hill’s poetry collection Men Who Feed Pigeons, looking at different kinds of women’s relationships with men. The titles are chosen from a longlist nominated by the more than 300 writer members of the Folio Academy, with the shortlist chosen by a panel of judges headed by novelist Tessa Hadley. “The books under consideration are all nominated by writers, and so the quality of the work is very high,” said Hadley. “So many good books, prose fiction and poetry and nonfiction – so difficult to weigh one against another. We all brought certain passions to the table when we met.” Hadley, who is joined on the judging panel by the poet Rachel Long and travel writer William Atkins, said that just a few books had “seized” judges from the first page: “[They] hadn’t let us down until the last, and then seemed even richer and larger on a second reading.” The eight titles were whittled down from the 20-strong longlist which was announced alongside the finalists. It included Sally Rooney’s third novel Beautiful World, Where Are You and Emily Ratajkowski’s memoir My Body. The winner will be announced on 23 March, in a ceremony at the British Library.

2/10/2022,"The government’s plan to drop all Covid restrictions a month early has threatened to open a rift between unions and employers, with the TUC warning it could be a “green light for bosses to cut corners”. The prime minister’s announcement that all domestic Covid-19 restrictions in England, including the requirement for people with the virus to self-isolate, will be dropped from 21 February, sparked jubilation from pub and nightclub owners that life will return to moribund city centres, but one business lobby group warned that “conflict and confusion” will follow unless there is clear guidance.  People with Covid will be expected to stay at home, as they would with flu, but without a legal requirement backed up by hefty fines. Rules are also being relaxed in Scotland and Wales, and Northern Ireland intends to ditch most remaining curbs this week. The TUC urged employers to carry out proper risk assessments to keep staff safe at work, including checking whether they have adequate ventilation. It also called on the government to keep statutory sick pay a right from day one (rather than reverting to day four, as was the case before the pandemic), to ensure that all workers are covered by it, and to increase the level of sick pay. At the moment, about 2 million people, mostly women, do not earn enough to qualify. TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “Today’s announcement is not a green light for bosses to cut corners. “It’s also vital that ministers fix our broken sick pay system once and for all. Workers who are laid low by Covid must be able to make ends meet – not pushed into financial hardship. It beggars belief that millions still don’t have access to decent sick pay. This is leaving the country vulnerable to new variants and pandemics.” The warmest welcome came from the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), representing more than 1,400 nightclubs, bars, casinos and festivals, which said it was “extremely pleased”. Michael Kill, the NTIA chief executive, said: “The impact of Covid isolation periods on the hospitality and night-time economy workforce has been extremely challenging for businesses. These proposed changes would be a welcome relief and would go some way to helping the sector recover.” Phil Urban, the chief executive of Mitchells & Butlers, which has 1,700 pubs and restaurants including Harvester and All Bar One chains, said: “Lessening restrictions has to be good news for the industry. The one thing that’s missing is consumer confidence and that change could be the start of rebuilding.” Tim Martin, the chair of JD Wetherspoon, said: “It will be a long road back to normality, but this is a good first step.” The CBI business group said the lifting of restrictions would “be a symbolic moment as we move away from crisis mode to learning to live with the virus”. A spokesperson added: “Maintaining confidence is key, so firms are likely to continue extra measures to protect their staff and customers, as they have done since the outset of the pandemic. And keeping Covid infrastructure in place, like free mass rapid testing and access to vaccines, will still remain essential.” The CBI added that while hybrid working was here to stay, lifting restrictions would help draw staff back to offices, because “trade in our city centres for some sectors has taken a heavy toll”. Claire Walker, co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “Businesses will welcome the removal of the self-isolation requirement if there is crystal clear guidance on what this means for firms and their legal responsibilities to employees and customers. “Without clear guidance, there is a real risk that this move could increase conflict and confusion in the workplace. Firms also need to understand the government’s plan should there be further public health challenges that require a return to restrictions.” The Federation of Small Businesses said many small firms would welcome the move, as long as it was safe. Its national chair, Mike Cherry, said: “We’re urging the government to bring back the workplace testing initiative, remove the lower earnings limit for sick pay entitlement and extend the current [statutory sick pay] rebate for small firms to cover all time away from the workplace.” Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium, welcomed the return to a more normal experience for customers, staff and businesses, but said retailers would need further details of the plans. In the capital, Transport for London passengers, will still be required to wear masks when they travel onbuses, trains and the underground. A spokesperson for the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the decision to keep the policy in place when compulsory mask-wearing was dropped last month would remain in place when all Covid restrictions are relaxed later this month.",News/Business,"End of Covid curbs ‘not a green light for cutting corners’, warn unions",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/09/end-of-covid-curbs-not-a-green-light-for-cutting-corners-warn-unions
2/10/2022,"The Morrison government has passed the religious discrimination bill in a marathon all-night sitting of the House of Representatives, despite Liberal moderates defecting to help add more extensive protections for LGBTQ+ students. The Liberal MPs Bridget Archer, Trent Zimmerman, Katie Allen, Fiona Martin and Dave Sharma crossed the floor against the government, helping Labor and the crossbench add protections for LGBTQ+ students into the Sex Discrimination Act.  The main bill received a third reading at 4am, officially passing the lower house with Labor support after Wednesday’s resolution by the opposition caucus to fight for amendments but not oppose the bill at the final stage. The human rights amendment bill, which now prevents religious schools discriminating against students on gender and sexuality, passed shortly before 5am – despite a last-ditch attempt from the government to defeat its own legislation. Labor and several of the government’s own members were galvanised by the Morrison government revealing it will protect gay students from expulsion – but not other forms of discrimination – without protecting trans students at the same time. Zimmerman told the house the parliament could not send a message by “omission” by moving to fix sexuality discrimination but not gender identity discrimination. “I could not live with myself if I didn’t seek to address those issues.” #BREAKING Labor has been successful in protecting LGBTQI school children from discrimination. Earlier, the Morrison government defeated Labor amendments to the statements of belief clause by the narrowest margin. Despite Archer and Zimmerman voting against the government, shortly after 2.30am the speaker, Andrew Wallace, used his casting vote to break a 62-all tie to thwart Labor’s amendment to the controversial clause. Further amendments to ban vilification on the grounds of religion and discrimination in the provision of in-home aged care services were defeated, with Zimmerman joining the Coalition, Bob Katter and Craig Kelly on those votes. The Liberal MP Warren Entsch, who earlier told parliament he didn’t believe the bill was necessary and still had concerns about statements of belief and LGBTQ+ kids, nevertheless voted against all amendments, claiming it was necessary to “bank the successes” of other changes to the bill. Labor’s fight to amend the package of legislation will now move to the Senate, where it hopes support from the Greens, Rex Patrick, Jacqui Lambie, Stirling Griff and Liberal defectors including Andrew Bragg will help it win amendments defeated in the lower house. Bragg has already called for the statements of belief clause, which protects religious statements even if they offend, insult or humiliate others on the basis of protected attributes, to be removed in its entirety. Scott Morrison called for the bill to pass in a speech at 12.50am, arguing it was necessary to provide “the freedom” that migrants come to Australia to access. The prime minister told parliament he “earnestly hoped [the bill] would unite this place” and be achieved with bipartisan support. Morrison thanked members for “their commitment to the children we are raising in this country, and the best interests of their welfare”. He noted concerns about LGBTQ+ students, promising the government amendment would prevent the expulsion of gay kids and arguing there would be a “time and place” to consider transgender students after the Australian Law Reform Commission review to follow in six months. He revealed that the government will set up a new select committee for youth mental health in parliament, to be led by Allen and Martin. In later debate, Anthony Albanese reminded Morrison that he had committed to him in writing on 1 December to prevent “any form of discrimination against a student on the basis of sexuality or gender identity” and had done the same before the Wentworth byelection in 2018. The Labor leader suggested that voters in Wentworth, where Sharma faces a fierce challenge from the independent Allegra Spender, would remind the government of that commitment. Anna Brown, the chief executive of national LGBTQ+ lobby group Equality Australia, said the passage of the religious discrimination bill was a “dark [day] for our community”. A dark for our community as the #ReligiousDiscriminationBill passes the House of Representatives.But proposed amendments to protect students and teachers are yet to be voted on.And we’ll continue the fight in the Senate. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, accused Labor of supporting “Scott Morrison’s hate bill, saying it’s terrible but then voting it into law”.“For all their strong speeches, not one single Labor MP voted with the Greens and crossbench to oppose the bill,” he said. Votes in the Senate will be tight, with Labor likely to need the Greens, three crossbench senators and at least one government senator for every amendment. Patrick, Griff and Lambie have all confirmed they oppose the bill but are yet to consider Labor’s amendments in detail. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Patrick told Guardian Australia: “I do not want any discrimination against LGBTQ+ people – children or staff.” Earlier on Wednesday Pauline Hanson offered the Coalition a Senate lifeline, promising that One Nation will vote for the legislation despite its claim it would oppose all government bills over its handling of the pandemic. Labor has resolved to “insist” on any amendments passed in either house until Liberal members help pass them or Morrison withdraws the bill, setting up a potential impasse if the Senate makes further amendments. Albanese indicated in caucus that a further meeting could reconsider in the event of an impasse – leaving a pathway to pass the bill before the 2022 election. In parliament, Albanese described the bill as “flawed”, warning that although he supports prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of religion, “I don’t support doing it at the expense of increasing discrimination against others.”",News/Australia news,Coalition’s religious discrimination bill passes after marathon all-night sitting,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/coalition-religious-discrimination-bill-passes-after-marathon-all-night-sitting
2/10/2022,"A Colorado mother who faked her seven-year-old daughter’s illnesses until she eventually died will be sentenced on Wednesday after she pleaded guilty to child abuse resulting in death. Last month, Kelly Turner also admitted to charitable fraud and theft between $100,000 and $1m, according to prosecutors.  Turner’s daughter, Olivia Grant, died in the summer of 2017. The death was initially listed as intestinal failure, but an autopsy found no evidence of the condition. Authorities have not declared what killed her, but according to a 2019 indictment doctors went along with a do-not-resuscitate order that Turner had signed. Other conditions that Turner also claimed her daughter had – including a seizure disorder, a tumor and a buildup of fluid in the cavities deep within her brain – were similarly not found in the autopsy. “The manner of death is best certified as undetermined,” the coroner wrote. Turner moved to Colorado from Texas with her three daughters, and beginning in 2012 told local doctors that Grant was sick with numerous ailments and diseases. She convinced medical professionals to perform surgeries and fill prescriptions for illnesses her daughter did not have. Authorities say Turner spent years fabricating her daughter’s illness, gaining sympathy from television news stories and charitable foundations such as Make-A-Wish, which even threw a “bat princess” costume party for Grant at a hotel that cost $11,000. Throughout Turner’s campaign to bring attention to her dying daughter, she sought donations to help fulfill Grant’s dreams of “catching a bad guy” with police and of being a firefighter. A video put out by a suburban Denver municipal government shows Olivia riding on a truck, putting out a dumpster fire and telling firefighters to stand for attention – all of which were met with the little girl’s smiles and laughter despite several medical tubes poking out of her backpack. According to the indictment, Turner allegedly received over $538,000 in Medicaid benefits and from GoFundMe donors. At Grant first ER visit, a doctor thought she appeared to be growing normally. But the next year, a surgeon at the same hospital removed part of her small intestine and inserted a feeding tube. Before Grant was admitted to hospice care, where she died, doctors said she had only been receiving 30% of the required nutrition, according to the indictment. Grant’s grandfather, Lonnie Gautreau, who, alongside Grant’s father filed a $25m lawsuit against the Colorado Children’s Hospital for mistreating Grant, recalled his granddaughter’s final moments. “She opened her eyes and looked at me and recognized me and said, ‘Paw Paw, I’m hungry.’ She was hungry,” Gautreau said. The case was resolved in August. A lawyer representing the grandparents said she could not comment further. Psychiatrists say Turner’s behavior seems consistent with Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a psychological disorder in which parents or caregivers seek attention from the illness of their children or dependents and sometimes cause them injuries. The disorder has increasingly been featured in popular movies and television series in recent years, including Sharp Objects, The Act and Run. However, experts say these types of cases are not easy to detect. At one point, Turner herself brought up the syndrome during an interview with investigators. She denied she had it.

2/10/2022,"The “vast majority” of Conservative MPs support the government’s net zero climate plans despite increasingly vocal opposition from a small number of backbenchers, according to a Tory environment group. On Tuesday the Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG) of 19 Conservatives was accused of attempting to derail the government’s green agenda, linking it to the cost-of-living crisis and calling for cuts to green taxes and an increase in fossil fuel production.  But the Conservative Environment Network (CEN), which represents 123 MPs and 15 Tory peers, insisted the party’s rank and file remained committed to the government’s climate agenda. “The vast majority of Conservative MPs support net zero,” said Jack Richardson, from CEN. “They voted to enshrine the UK’s net zero by 2050 target in law and stood on a manifesto to deliver on that pledge.” The NZSG has gained widespread media coverage in the past month, arguing the government’s plans to reach net zero emissions by 2050 have been dreamed up by out-of-touch elites and would impoverish working people, “making them colder and poorer”. Two leading members of the NZSG have links to an organisation often described as “climate-sceptic”. The group’s chair has also been accused by a leading climate institute of using misleading and inaccurate information. More than half of its members were involved in the European Research Group (ERG), which successfully pushed for the Brexit referendum inside the Tory party. This has led to fears of a similar “culture war” campaign around net zero and the end of the cross-party consensus on the need for climate action. The 19 Conservatives in the NZSG group say they do not dispute climate science or the need to decarbonise. Richardson said the overwhelming majority of Tory politicians understood the necessity – and potential benefits – offered by a rapid reduction in emissions. “Net zero is not only about staving off the worst consequences of climate change but delivering new high-paid, skilled jobs across the UK through a new green industrial revolution. “We need to do it fairly, let the market lead, and ensure taxpayers get value for their money, but the economic reward will be substantial if we get it right.” A spokesperson for No 10 said the government remained “fully committed to reaching net zero by 2050”. “By reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, we will eradicate our exposure to the volatile global energy prices, which are currently hiking up household energy bills,” they added. Separately, the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, set out new plans to accelerate the rollout of renewable energy projects by holding auctions for support contracts every year from 2023. The annual auctions will offer renewable energy developers more opportunities to develop their projects, and help make the UK “less reliant on volatile fossil fuels and [create] more homegrown power”, Kwarteng said. Dr Simon Cran-McGreehin, head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “More frequent, annual auctions under the net zero target will provide a steady stream of opportunity to British renewables projects supporting jobs in levelling up areas.” Most experts argue the government’s current climate plans are inadequate and failing – pointing to proposals for an increase in coal mining, a new oilfield in the North Sea and a massive expansion of the roads network. Greenpeace’s head of politics, Rebecca Newsom, said the government should ignore the “small minority of misinformed” backbenchers. “The vast majority of the country, young and old, Labour and Conservative, gets that the climate crisis is an existential threat and supports the idea of acting fast if we want to avoid the worst … Any government that’s committed to protecting people from extreme weather, creating jobs and a thriving economy should have no time for this nonsense.”",News/Environment,"Most Conservative MPs support net zero, says Tory environment group",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/09/most-conservative-mps-support-net-zero-says-tory-environment-network
2/10/2022,"Emma Walmsley is at the starting line. That may sound a churlish assessment of years of graft to get GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer products division fit for demerger this summer, but it’s roughly accurate. The “step-change in growth”, as the chief executive puts it, for the core pharmaceutical division has always been the main event and that race has barely started. More generously, one can say it was an achievement to avoid stumbles during the warmup stages. Elliott Advisors, the noisy activist in the wings, ultimately proved only a minor distraction. Other shareholders showed no appetite for regime change and backed Walmsley and her strategy. The fact that Unilever put £50bn on the table for the consumer division vindicated the thesis that the Sensodyne-to-Panadol unit is a store of riches (even if the stock market still has to endorse that valuation). GSK’s share price has improved by a third since its sickly level of £12 a year ago.  Yet £20-plus is really a minimum definition of medium-term success given that GSK was at £18 before the pandemic disrupted demand for the group’s bestselling shingles vaccine. It ought to be possible. Wednesday’s bang-in-line numbers for 2021 were accompanied by a forecast of 5%-7% growth in sales in pharmaceuticals this year and 12%-14% in operating profit. Walmsley’s five-year promise was compound rates of 5% and 10% respectively, so it’s on pace. As ever, though, investors look ahead. Seven potential drugs, including biggies for a respiratory virus, hepatitis B and rheumatoid arthritis, receive critical read-outs from the labs this year, the first big test on Walmsley’s watch of the quality of the pipeline. Further out, she may need a big pharma deal to ignite the next round of innovation – or, at least, that’s the City’s view. But she’s in the hunt. Her position looks as secure now as at any time in the past year. So much for the idea that Arm Holdings would return in glory to the London Stock Exchange, carried aloft by local investors who regret their former luddite ways. Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank, crushed dreams of a happy homecoming for Cambridge’s finest chip designer with a few brutal words on Tuesday: “We think that the Nasdaq stock exchange in the US, which is at the centre of global hi-tech, would be most suitable [for a listing]”. This twist in the plot, sadly, was always a hazard. SoftBank’s attempt to sell Arm to Nvidia of the US has been slowly collapsing for months, but it was never guaranteed that London would be chosen for an alternative disposal via IPO. Arm was plucked from the UK market in 2016 but sentiment doesn’t count for much. SoftBank is a semi-forced seller and will list the company where it thinks it will secure the highest price. Despite Nasdaq’s wobble in recent weeks, that place is probably still New York. For the London Stock Exchange – and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the cheerleader-in-chief for UK tech – there is a question of how hard to fight to try to persuade Son to re-think. It would be embarrassing to mount a campaign and fail. A secondary listing in London is a feasible runner-up prize, but even that isn’t guaranteed. Blame Theresa May and Philip Hammond, the prime minister and chancellor in 2016. In their post-Brexit confusion, they blessed Arm’s takeover in exchange for a few loose pledges from SoftBank about jobs and investment in the UK. If they had also insisted that any re-listing of Arm would have to be in London, Son might have signed. A minor miracle must have taken place at Liverpool Victoria. It is only three months since the board of the LV= mutual insurer was telling its members that “significant investment” was needed “to be able to compete effectively in the future”. Since it wouldn’t be fair to use internal capital (because with-profits policies might expire before there was a return on the investment), a takeover by Bain Capital was deemed essential. Well, the Bain deal was shot down by members and now merger talks with Royal London have failed. But, it turns out, LV= thinks its troubles have evaporated. The performance of the business “has strengthened the Board’s belief in, and commitment to, the continuation of our status as an independent mutual,” says Seamus Creedon, the interim chair. To put it mildly, this claim needs a fuller explanation given previous statements. And the most baffling part of all is that Mark Hartigan, the chief executive and chief advocate for the Bain surrender, is deemed the right boss to lead an independent future. There is a credibility shortfall.",News/Business,"Noisy activists aside, GSK investors backed Walmsley and her strategy",https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/feb/09/noisy-activists-aside-gsk-investors-backed-walmsley-and-her-strategy
2/10/2022,"Many people will share the mayor of London’s anger and disgust at the Metropolitan police’s glaring failures, including some within the service itself. On Wednesday, Sadiq Khan warned that Cressida Dick, its commissioner, has “days or weeks” to win back trust, signalling he is otherwise ready to oust her. For some, her command of the operation that led to the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005 should have barred her from the top job in the first place. After 2017, when she took over, confidence in the Met fell steeply. An explosion in the use of stop and search unnecessarily alienated communities, with little evidence it has led to sustained falls in violence.  Then came Sarah Everard’s murder by serving officer Wayne Couzens, and the crackdown on a vigil in her memory; the sharing of pictures of murdered sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman by officers; the failure to catch serial killer Stephen Port, which a jury found “probably” contributed to the death of three of his four victims. These and a spate of other stories have devastated trust. Dame Cressida herself was criticised for hampering the inquiry into the murder of private detective Daniel Morgan, in a report warning of “institutional corruption” in the service. Last week, the emergence of vile misogynist, racist and homophobic messages exchanged between officers at Charing Cross station was added to this appalling catalogue. For the public, as for Mr Khan it seems, it is the Met’s calamitous response as much as the events themselves that have destroyed confidence. Following Couzens’s sentencing, it told women to wave down a bus if they had concerns for their safety. Nine of the 14 officers involved at Charing Cross are still serving; extraordinarily, two have been promoted. It appears that Ms Dick and those around her just do not get it – or do not care. Some parts of the community have long had reason to distrust the police. But the fear that officers cannot be relied upon to protect and serve, and that they may instead pose a threat, is now increasingly mainstream. The Home Office reappointed Dame Cressida last autumn. The assumption is that if Mr Khan formally expresses no confidence then her position would be untenable; in 2008 Sir Ian Blair resigned as commissioner after losing the support of the then mayor – Boris Johnson. But that is a matter of precedent and common sense, not of agreed procedure. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the Met is investigating No 10 over lockdown parties (its reluctance to do so having further hit its reputation). No one imagines it is easy for a leader to change an institution such as the police. But change can come only from the top. The leader sets the tone and the standards: she can reward whistleblowers, and punish or remove those who fall short. Dame Cressida must be aware that beyond the question of her duty, there is an institutional calculation to be made. The police in Britain enjoy operational independence, but politicians carry the can when it goes wrong. If the service cannot sort itself out, the temptation may be for a more hands-on approach. It would not be in the interest of the public or the Met for politicians to direct day-to-day policing. The more profound and urgent issue is that the police cannot afford to be regarded with fear or contempt. Good officers are appalled by the actions of some of their colleagues. When the public lose faith, it doesn’t merely sap morale; a difficult and dangerous job becomes still harder and riskier. Mr Khan is right to put Dame Cressida on notice. If she will not take action, she should make way for someone who will.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Met commissioner: clear it up – or clear out | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-met-commissioner-clear-it-up-or-clear-out
2/10/2022,"It’s 25 years since James Grant, who had recently been made redundant from his position as an executive at Granada TV, published his first Jack Reacher thriller under the pseudonym Lee Child. There are now more bestselling books than years separating the author from his former career. The stories follow the dealings of the eponymous Reacher, a demobbed military policeman, who wanders the US unencumbered by possessions save a toothbrush and a passport. Along the way he solves crimes and deals comprehensively, often violently, with the bad guys. Despite the apparently blokeish content, with its technical descriptions of weaponry, deadpan sentences and lengthy fight scenes, they are nevertheless popular among a number of impeccably distinguished British literary women – Kate Atkinson, Dame Margaret Drabble and Lady Antonia Fraser among them. (And to be fair, not just women: Philip Pullman and the great Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami are also admirers.) Now the books are to have a fresh life, with a new adaptation launched on Amazon this month. Screen versions have stuttered in the past. Fans found it hard to accept neatly proportioned Tom Cruise as Reacher for a pair of movies, since the hero, according to the novels, is 6ft 5in and built like a tank. Also, some of the books’ most salient and attractive features are not so much the twists and turns of plot, but Reacher’s quiet, dry wit; the texture of small-town America; and his passing interactions with waitresses and barbers and librarians – all things that need time to unfurl, a quality that TV can afford. It is likely that fans will be more satisfied with Nick Santora’s adaptations than with the films. In lead actor Alan Ritchson, the makers have found, in the words of Guardian television critic Lucy Mangan, a performer “the size of a house and roughly as expressive unless called upon to be otherwise” – in other words, someone absolutely perfect for the part.  There have been subtle tweaks: in updating the story to the present day, to the world of Instagram and climate crisis, Reacher makes jokes about recycling. And instead of buying new clothes whenever he needs them and binning the old ones, as he does in the books, he shops at a thrift store. Lest he sound too much like a paragon of modern virtues, though, there’s also the violence – which ought, by rights, to be unpalatable on TV. In its original form, the fighting is rendered slowly: it is tracked move by move by the author so that it becomes stylised. In the adaptation, by contrast, it’s all over blessedly quickly, but it retains the stylised nature of Child’s prose original; there’s a choreographed grace to it that makes it seem as much like ballet as actual fighting. Asked why he liked Child’s novels, Murakami replied, with typical (and almost Reacher-like) economy: “Everything’s the same!” That’s a little unfair, since Child has played with various fictional points of view and techniques in the books. But in one essential, Murakami is right. Reacher’s calm triumph over the bad guys is always the same. If only real life were like that.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Jack Reacher: enduring appeal,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/09/the-guardian-view-on-jack-reacher-enduring-appeal
2/10/2022,"There are still unanswered questions over how the refurbishment of Boris Johnson’s Downing Street flat was funded. As Labour demands an investigation into the prime minister by the Metropolitan police, here is what we know so far.  It is not uncommon for new prime ministers to want to renovate their grace-and-favour Downing Street flat. A £30,000 annual grant, funded by the taxpayer, is available to them. Fresh from his landslide election win in December 2019, Johnson and his then partner, Carrie Symonds, now his wife, pressed ahead with renovating the residence they inherited from Theresa and Philip May. The renovation, under the high-end designer Lulu Lytle, cost at least £112,000, and included gold-coloured wallpaper and fittings. But the source of the funding became the biggest controversy. The Daily Mail initially reported Johnson wanted to set up a Downing Street trust headed by the Tory peer David Brownlow, letting donors pay for the upkeep of various parts of the estate. In response, Johnson said he had met all the costs personally. But his former adviser Dominic Cummings said he had told Johnson the plan to have donors secretly foot the bill was “unethical, foolish, possibly illegal and almost certainly broke the rules on proper disclosure of political donations if conducted in the way he intended”. While Cummings certainly had an axe to grind, it prompted Johnson’s ethics adviser, Christopher Geidt, to launch an investigation. Lord Geidt concluded the prime minister acted “unwisely” to proceed with the renovations without “more rigorous regard for how this would be funded” given the trust never came to fruition, but said Johnson assured him he “knew nothing” about the source of the payments “until immediately prior to media reports in February 2021”. However, the Electoral Commission then opened an investigation into whether a £52,000 donation from Lord Brownlow’s company, Huntswood Associates Ltd, had been declared properly by the Conservatives. It concluded the donation was not declared properly and fined the party £17,000. It also revealed that WhatsApp messages were exchanged between Johnson and Brownlow in November 2020. This prompted Geidt to reinvestigate, given the suggestion Johnson had known about the source of the money, despite claiming otherwise. Geidt ultimately concluded in January 2022 that he still believed Johnson had not broken the ministerial code, but cast doubt on whether he would still have found in May the previous year that the prime minister took all steps to make the correct donation and seek advice when he first became aware of the payments. The only other person who could have investigated Johnson was parliament’s standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone. However, she assured No 10 in January that she would not be launching her own investigation into whether Johnson broke the MPs’ code of conduct. It was believed that given Johnson’s flat is used in his ministerial capacity, Geidt’s role for investigating potential breaches of the ministerial code was the final hurdle for Johnson to clear. Given the content of Johnson’s messages with Brownlow only became public in January 2022, Labour is calling for the police to investigate Johnson and why he asked Brownlow to approve more redecorating funds in the same message as he promised to look at a project known as the “great exhibition 2”. Labour wants to know if there were further messages from Johnson, particularly related to the “great exhibition 2”. There is no suggestion that Brownlow has failed to divulge relevant communications. Another question centres on how Johnson ultimately paid £112,549 direct to the supplier of the renovations, before the supplier returned the funds from Brownlow and the Cabinet Office.",News/Politics,What do we know about Boris Johnson’s Downing Street flat renovation?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/09/what-we-know-boris-johnson-downing-street-flat-renovation
2/10/2022,"Scotland Yard is considering whether to investigate Boris Johnson over the funding of his Downing Street flat renovation after Labour’s lawyers claimed there was a “reasonable suspicion” that he had broken anti-bribery laws. Solicitors on behalf of Labour wrote to the Metropolitan police commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, last week suggesting the force was “duty-bound” to begin a formal investigation.  They said the prime minister may have acted improperly by having “linked” a request for funds to cover the refurbishment works – which eventually cost at least £112,000 – with a promise to “promote a project” backed by the benefactor. Last month the Met announced a criminal inquiry into 12 alleged Downing Street parties, including several attended by Johnson, after initially saying it would not investigate until the completion of the Sue Gray report. A series of messages exchanged in November 2020 between Johnson and David Brownlow, a Conservative peer and donor, showed the prime minister seeking funds for the refurbishment while promising to consider plans for a “great exhibition”. Publication of the messages last month, as part of letters exchanged by Johnson and his independent ethics adviser, Christopher Geidt, prompted claims that Johnson had acted corruptly. Labour’s lawyers, from the firm Edwards Duthie Shamash, claimed the contents of the three messages showed Johnson “chose to link” the request for Brownlow to approve money to spruce up the No 11 flat with an assurance he was “taking some steps” on the great exhibition project, known as GE2. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Brownlow. Brownlow thanked Johnson for thinking about the plan. Seven weeks later, the peer secured a meeting with the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, to discuss the idea further. The government has refused to publish the minutes of that meeting but a spokesperson said GE2 was an “idea that wasn’t taken forward”. Labour’s lawyers said that despite an investigation by the Electoral Commission finding the Conservatives failed to properly declare a £52,801 donation from Brownlow’s company Huntswood Associates Limited, and another inquiry by Geidt that found Johnson had acted unwisely, there were other “matters left uninvestigated and unconsidered”. They said the previous investigations had not looked at potential corruption or bribery by the prime minister, whether further messages were exchanged between Johnson and Brownlow and what action the prime minister took when he promised to “revert” in relation to the great exhibition project. Gerald Shamash said in the letter to the Met: “It is respectfully suggested that the known facts and the clear, sensible inferences to which some of those facts give rise create such reasonable suspicion that, were the suspect anyone other than the prime minister, the Metropolitan police would rightly consider itself duty-bound to investigate. “Indeed, if anything, the fact that the suspicion arises in relation to someone in such a high office makes it more, not less, important in the public interest that these matters are investigated.” Shamash said Johnson would have broken the Bribery Act if, in the course of carrying out a public function, he had requested financial help and carried out his duties as prime minister improperly, whether intentionally or not. DI Akshay Chibber, a staff officer to Dick, acknowledged receipt of the letter and promised “an appropriate response in due course”. A Met spokesperson said: “A letter was received and acknowledged on Friday 4 February. It is being considered by officers from the Met’s central specialist crime [unit]. No investigation has been opened.” Brownlow declined to comment. He has cooperated fully with the two investigations so far, conducted by the Electoral Commission and Geidt. A No 10 spokesperson said: “These allegations are categorically untrue and a clear misrepresentation of the facts. Lord Brownlow, separate to his work for the emerging Downing Street Trust, put proposals from the Royal Albert Hall, the national institution and charity, to the prime minister. This was passed to the lead department, DCMS [the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]. It is a matter of public record that no project was taken forward by the government.” The extent of Johnson’s contact with Brownlow about the flat funding came to light in December, when the Electoral Commission confirmed the existence of WhatsApp messages between them. The revelation appeared at odds with the prime minister telling Geidt in May 2021 that he knew nothing about where the money to fund the renovation came from. Johnson says he did not know Brownlow was a source of funding rather than an organiser. After nearly a year of the costs being met by a combination of Brownlow, Huntswood, the Cabinet Office and the Conservative party, the Electoral Commission said the Cabinet Office confirmed in March 2021 that Johnson had “paid all bills with the supplier personally”. The prime minister was forced to apologise for not divulging the messages to Geidt but said he did not recall them and that there were “security issues” that prevented him from accessing the messages on his phone.

2/10/2022,"In the often acrimonious back-and-forth between Russia and Ukraine in recent years, “fulfilling Minsk” has become something of a meaningless mantra: all sides agree to abide by the 2015 Minsk accords in public, but neither has any real intention of implementing the provisions of the agreement. Yet in his intensive peacemaking efforts this week, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, appears to be pinning his hopes on a renewed attempt to breathe life into the seven-year-old agreement.  “The solution of the Ukraine question can be only political, and the basis of the solution can only be the Minsk agreements,” said Macron in Moscow on Monday. The next day in Kyiv, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, reaffirmed to Macron what he has been saying for months: Ukraine is committed to fulfilling the Minsk accords, as long as this happens in the way Kyiv interprets them. Privately, however, Ukrainian officials are more downbeat. “Minsk is impossible to fulfil. It would lead to the destruction of Ukraine as a state if we did,” said one high-ranking government official. The Minsk accords were signed in February 2015, after a 16-hour overnight negotiating session in the Belarusian capital. Of the four leaders involved: Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Ukraine’s Petro Poroshenko, France’s François Hollande and Germany’s Angela Merkel, only Putin is still in office. The document called for an immediate ceasefire in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, and did bring major military hostilities to an end, but the conflict has continued to simmer and little progress has been made on any of the political steps. The agreement calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops and mercenaries, as well as constitutional reform in Ukraine that would provide for decentralisation and elections in the current territories, which are financed and administered by Moscow. For a long time, the main stumbling block was over sequencing. Kyiv insisted the separatists should first disarm, while Moscow demanded political reform first. There is little appetite in Ukrainian society for any Minsk-based settlement that could give parliamentary seats to Russia’s proxies, and essentially give Moscow a say in the running of Ukraine. There is also the fact that seven years have elapsed since the accords were signed. A de facto line of control now snakes through Luhansk and Donetsk regions, and since the coronavirus pandemic hit, crossings have fallen dramatically in number. “The people on the other side have spent eight years being subjected to propaganda about Ukraine, most of them have been given Russian passports. Their leaders are Russian citizens. How are we expected now to integrate them back, and have their representatives sit in Kyiv? It doesn’t make sense,” said the high-ranking official. Russia has given out more than 700,000 passports to residents of the territories, according to a recent statement by a Russian official. Critics of the Minsk agreement say Poroshenko signed it in 2015 because a gun was pointed at Ukraine’s head, as Kyiv’s forces faced total military defeat from an enemy that was receiving covert support from the Kremlin. “From my point of view, the Minsk agreements were born dead,” said Volodymyr Ariev, an MP from Poroshenko’s party. “The conditions were always impossible to implement. We understood it clearly at the time, but we signed it to buy time for Ukraine: to have time to restore our government, our army, intelligence and security system.” He said many of the points in Minsk were incompatible with the Ukrainian constitution, and that with Russia, Ukraine could not be expected to fulfil its demands. “Macron cannot compel Ukraine to do it Moscow’s way,” said Ariev. Asked during his press conference with Macron about Ukraine’s reluctance to implement the Minsk accords, Putin used a phrase that some interpreted as carrying sinister undertones: “Like it or not, you’ll have to tolerate it, my beauty.” The next day, Zelenskiy responded that Ukraine was indeed “tolerant”, as it put up with so much from Russia. But keen to avoid a Russian invasion, as well as to remove the looming threat of one which is eroding Ukraine’s economy, Zelenskiy is also pushing Minsk as a viable solution, at least in public. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, said the accords could still provide a viable roadmap if interpreted correctly. “Within the Minsk framework it is really possible to pass to peace through any difficulties, but the steps and their content can only be those that fully respect the sovereignty of Ukraine,” he said.",News/World news,Can Ukraine and Russia be persuaded to abide by Minsk accords?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/can-ukraine-and-russia-be-persuaded-to-abide-by-minsk-accords
2/10/2022,"First they were hit by claims they planned to cull wallabies on the Scottish island they are buying, triggering uproar. Now the broadcaster Kirsty Young and her husband, the Soho House founder Nick Jones, have been hit by another hurdle: a formal objection from the Woodland Trust against their plans to chop down scores of trees on Inchconnachan, an idyllic, heavily wooded island on Loch Lomond.  The couple’s quest to restore Inchconnachan, owned until now by the same aristocratic Scottish family for more than 700 years, to its wild, natural beauty is under fire from a host of influential critics. Local residents, the naturalist and broadcaster Chris Packham, the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and now the Woodland Trust have raised objections, urging the pair to heavily dilute their plans to strip the island of all its non-native species. A petition opposing a cull begun by one critic, Craig Morrison, had nearly 60,000 signatures by Wednesday afternoon. More objections may follow. NatureScot, the government conservation agency, is studying the pair’s plans. The island, once home to a now extinct population of capercaillies, is covered by a number of legally binding conservation designations, particularly to preserve its ancient oak forest, which the agency enforces. In its letter of objection, the Woodland Trust argues that established non-native species such as Norway spruce have legal protection, even in an ancient woodland. It argues the couple’s building plans will also involve the unjustified loss of irreplaceable veteran trees. Jones and Young bought Inchconnachan, one of a small cluster of islands off Loch Lomond’s western edge, for £1.6m in 2020. Uninhabited for more than 20 years, the island includes a derelict and ramshackle old cottage, rusting wooden and cast iron sheds, crumbling concrete paving and a disused pier. It is also overrun by invasive rhododendron. It also boasts the world’s most northerly mob of red-necked wallabies, of unknown size. Originally introduced on to the 42-hectare island as a single pair by its then owner Fiona Bryde Gore, the then Lady Arran, in the 1940s, it was estimated the troupe’s population had surged to more than 60 by 2009. If that was accurate, that quickly dwindled. A recent heat map study suggested there were as few as seven still alive. Jones is a multimillionaire thanks to his global empire of private members clubs, while Young is the former host of Desert Island Discs. Several weeks ago they unveiled plans to build a luxury timbered holiday lodge on Inchconnachan, and install a new boathouse and an interconnecting board walk across the island, in a lengthy planning application submitted to Loch Lomond and Trossach’s national park, the area’s planning authority. “The island is a beautiful and sensitive place, well protected for its historic woodlands, habitat and natural beauty but it is in a declining poor condition and under growing pressure from an increasing number of visitors, antisocial behaviour and grazing herbivores,” their application said. “We believe a bold, high-quality, comprehensive, sustainable and committed long-term plan is required to reverse the declining condition of the woodlands and to make this island world class, both in terms of its habitat and visitor experience.” But their plans to control the marsupials, without specifying how in their application, triggered an immediate response. Buried in one of the ecologists reports submitted to the national park, there is an explicit reference to culling the wallabies, along with the fallow deer and grey squirrel that roam Inchconnachan. “Wallaby continue to contribute a negative impact on the woodland ground flora and regeneration of this island,” it said. The other reports are less specific but make clear the deer and wallabies are voracious grazing animals that ignore exotic spruce but burrow into native blaeberry bushes, creating tunnels through the undergrowth. Deer are culled by being shot but Jones and Young now say they never planned to shoot their wallabies. Last weekend, prompted by Packham’s recommendation to find non-lethal ways of removing them, the couple confirmed they would instead investigate relocating them. The SSPCA, an animal welfare charity, argues even that is unwise. The SSPCA doubts the pair will find a zoo or safari park willing to rehome them, and believes that would also be inhumane. Culling is rejected out of hand. Ch Supt Mike Flynn, the SSPCA’s senior officer, urged the couple to hire wallaby experts to properly study their impact on the island. “We could not support efforts to relocate the wallabies unless there was clear evidence they were damaging habitat on the island,” he said on Wednesday. George Anderson, a spokesperson for the Woodland Trust, added: “The location is covered by a site of special scientific interest, a special protection area and special area of conservation designations – and it is in a national park. If ancient woodland isn’t safe here then something is far wrong. We call on the planning authority to reject this application.” A spokesperson for Jones declined to comment.",News/UK news,Woodland Trust joins objection to Kirsty Young’s plan for Scottish island,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/09/woodland-trust-joins-objection-to-kirsty-youngs-plan-for-scottish-island
2/10/2022,"You could tell that Boris Johnson thought he had just about got away with it. The last prime minister’s questions before the February recess safely negotiated. Two whole weeks ahead in which he could try to stop his backbenchers from thinking about parties and get them to focus instead on why they may possibly want him to remain as their leader. An uphill struggle, admittedly. But at least he had bought himself some time. Right now, every day longer he remained in Downing Street was a bonus. The guilty smirk had been replaced by a wide grin. The toddler haircut ruffled totally out of place. The bullshit meter off the scale. The bouncing up and down as he waved his arms excitedly. All was well with the world. Well enough, anyway.  True, it hadn’t gone wholly to plan. After announcing the end of Covid – come the end of the month, he wasn’t that bothered if people lived or died from the disease – Big Dog had rather come unstuck when Keir Starmer had asked him about Kwasi Kwarteng’s fraud gaffe. Saying he was tough on fraudsters when he had just written off £4.3bn in Covid loans that had been scammed off the government wasn’t entirely convincing. And the Labour leader had also made him look stupid by pointing out he hadn’t really understood the chancellor’s loan-shark scheme to lend money to the energy companies that was then clawed back over the next five years. Only a fool would expect him to know the details of his own policies. And come to think of it, where was the chancellor? Normally he was by his side, but today Rishi Sunak had deliberately placed himself at least six places away. Carefully avoiding the scene of the crime and all that. Still, at least they no longer had to pretend to get on. But the main thing was that it was over. Starmer hadn’t been at his sharpest and his six questions had now been and gone. And Johnson had survived mostly unscathed and could now operate on cruise control for the next 15 minutes. Then he would be out of the chamber. At least that was the plan until Fabian Hamilton got called to ask a question. The Labour MP kept it short and sweet. The Daily Mirror had just published a photograph of the No 10 quiz night party in December 2020, with an open bottle of prosecco and a Boris who looked as if he had drunk most of it. Though he could also have been at the alcohol-based sanitiser. That would be hardcore. So how did the prime minister explain this one? Tory MPs immediately grabbed their phones to check out the photo. Nadhim Zahawi was devastated. Last year he had insisted the quiz couldn’t have been a party because there had been no booze. So now he just looked a prize idiot. He should have known that when Big Dog had assured him it had been a staff training seminar, it was a lie. “He is completely in error,” mumbled The Suspect. What the error was, exactly, he didn’t say. Instead his florid complexion turned pasty white. Not because he knew precisely what was in the photo, but because he didn’t. There were so many pictures of him at parties that it was hard to keep track of what was what. Was this the one in which he was sweating heavily, stripped to the waist, while forming a conga with other members of staff? Or was it the one where he was dribbling while lying unconscious in the corner with red wine stains all over his shirt? Then a further thought struck him. If the Met had already seen this picture of what looked like a party and had decided it didn’t meet their prosecution threshold, then the other 299 photos of the 12 parties they were investigating must be damning. Or what if this was one of the photos he had so far managed to keep away from the police’s prying eyes? Suddenly, his idea to have a vanity snapper record his every imperial move didn’t seem quite so good. Though for the first time the country was getting value for money for him. He was so busted. Originally he had insisted the rules had been followed at all times. Then that he had been sickened and furious that various members of staff had been partying. Then that he had been at the parties that weren’t parties but work events. Now we had reached the point where The Suspect wasn’t going to resign even if he was found guilty and fined. Hell, he could do what he liked. Nobble the police. Have Sue Gray whacked. Top of the world, Ma! Thereafter The Suspect rather fell apart. He trotted out the usual lies about the cost of living, tax rises, employment and Brexit but his heart wasn’t really in it. He seemed curiously passionless. He didn’t even really quibble when Labour’s Ruth Jones said there was a similarity between him having got Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe condemned to an extended prison sentence and his Jimmy Savile comments that had incited the harassment of the Labour leader. Rather he just pretended it was nothing to do with him. He wasn’t there. He couldn’t have done it. It wasn’t his fault if people kept on misconstruing what he said. Such bad luck that it keeps happening to him. The same with the accident-prone Guto Harri. Who could have predicted he might need security vetting over Huawei? He was even lulled into agreeing with the catatonically stupid Natalie Elphicke that the lorry queues near Dover were all down to Brussels bureaucracy. One day she’ll wonder why Kent wasn’t a car park when the UK was part of the EU. The Suspect dived for the exit. To be mobbed by his new team of four permanent private secretaries. All of whom had been chosen for their lack of discrimination, personality and intellect. “You were brilliant,” they said in unison. For a moment, Johnson revelled in the flattery. Then he spotted the long faces and the lack of support elsewhere on his own benches and remembered he was on borrowed time.",News/Politics,Prime suspect turns pale as latest party photo snaps him bang to rights | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/09/prime-suspect-turns-pale-as-latest-party-photo-snaps-him-bang-to-rights
2/10/2022,"The most important thing is that Chelsea are one game away from winning the lot. This was an uneven performance from the European champions and although they did enough to stop Al-Hilal from pulling off a shock, there will have to be an improvement when they face Palmeiras in the Club World Cup final on Saturday. This was heavy going at times. Thomas Tuchel, who was forced to watch from home after testing positive for Covid-19 last week, will not be fooled. The German saw Romelu Lukaku settle a tight game, but Chelsea still have problems with their record signing. The unfortunate reality is that Lukaku’s only goals since giving that interview have come against Chesterfield and Al-Hilal, who put up a good fight throughout this semi-final, and the worry for Tuchel will be that his side remain unconvincing in attack.  That lack of ruthlessness is an issue for Chelsea. It almost cost them here. Al-Hilal kept fighting and Chelsea were indebted to Kepa Arrizabalaga, who made two stunning saves to deny Odion Ighalo and Mohamed Kanno in the second half. Chelsea knew that they could not afford to be complacent, especially as there was no Tuchel on the touchline to keep them on their toes. Al-Hilal were impressive in the previous round, thrashing Al Jazira 6-1, and the Saudi champions were not short of threats in the final third. Ighalo was a familiar face up front, even if the former Manchester United and Watford striker is not exactly the sprightliest of movers these days, and there were times when Al-Hilal looked dangerous, Moussa Marega’s physicality causing problems on the right and the former West Brom forward Matheus Pereira a nimble presence between the lines. This was not straightforward Chelsea, who were led by Tuchel’s assistants, Arno Michels and Zsolt Low. The Mohammed bin Zayed was a boisterous place at kick-off, the noisy contingent of Al-Hilal fans urging their side to upset the odds, and there was an understandably rustiness to Chelsea at first. There was less than a minute on the clock when slack play from Mateo Kovacic gifted Ighalo a shooting opportunity and it soon became clear how much this tournament means to teams outside Europe, Ali Al-Bulayhi typifying Al-Hilal’s commitment when he stretched every sinew in his body to hook the ball away from Lukaku just when the striker looked certain to burst through on goal in the 11th minute. By that point, though, Chelsea were already in control. Their defence had pushed up and Hakim Ziyech was an inventive presence on the right, his ability to find space giving Al Hilal constant problems. Chelsea, who reverted to a 3-4-2-1 system after using a back four when they knocked Plymouth Argyle out of the FA Cup last Saturday, soon began to create chances. Ziyech sent a fizzing drive inches over and Lukaku was guilty of a poor miss from a César Azpilicueta cross, flicking wide when he should have scored. At that stage it felt like it was going to be another trying experience for Lukaku, who often looked like a spare part in Chelsea’s attack. His movement was cumbersome, he strayed into offside positions on too many occasions and there was no hiding his lack of confidence when he wasted a chance to release Kai Havertz midway through the opening period. In that context it was difficult to know what to think when Lukaku put Chelsea ahead in the 32nd minute. Kovacic started the move, driving forward from deep, but Al-Hilal only had themselves to blame for failing to deal with Havertz’s cross. Yasir al-Shahrani got himself into a horrible muddle at the far post and when the left-back’s messy clearance bounced off Al-Bulayhi, Abdullah al-Maiouf had no chance of stopping Lukaku from beating him from close range. Yet does a scrappy goal against limited opposition mean that Lukaku’s woes are over? There was certainly little sign of any spark in the second half. Lukaku was barely involved after the interval and rarely appeared to be on the same wavelength as Havertz and Ziyech, who went close to extending Chelsea’s lead with a swerving drive that brought the best out of Al-Maiouf. Havertz also threatened, hitting the post after bursting through down the left, but Chelsea faded as the game wore on. The underdogs kept fighting and it took two wonderful saves from Arrizabalaga to preserve their advantage, Ighalo and Kanno thwarted by Chelsea’s goalkeeper. By the end, Chelsea were grateful to make it through. On this evidence they need Tuchel to join them in Abu Dhabi. They need his urgency.",Sport/Football,Lukaku strike sinks Al-Hilal and gives Chelsea shot at Club World Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/09/lukaku-strike-sinks-al-hilal-and-gives-chelsea-shot-at-club-world-cup
2/10/2022,"Lando Norris has announced a new deal that will see the British driver remain with McLaren until 2025. The contract is a strong statement of the driver’s confidence in the team as Formula One prepares to enter a new era. With the 2022 season’s car launches under way, Max Verstappen has also said he is raring to go and take on Lewis Hamilton for the world championship. The Dutch driver won the title for the first time last year and at the launch of his new Red Bull RB18 car was confident in his ability to defend his crown.  New regulations for the coming season ensure there will be no guarantees as to how competitive any team’s car will be but Norris clearly believes, in that climate, that McLaren can compete for race wins and even championships. The 22-year-old is entering his fourth season in the sport and last year achieved the best performances of his career. He took his first pole in Russia and would have converted it to a win but for late rain. He did manage four podium finishes and came sixth in the final standings. Norris revealed that he had been in talks with other teams but has opted to stick with McLaren, whom he joined in 2019. “Which teams? That is something I can’t say but you can probably guess,” he said. “I had to look at all the options. There were little chats here and there, but that is all, and nothing went further than that. The fact that I would have had those opportunities but have chosen to stay with McLaren is a strong message that this is where I want to be.” After a tightly fought contest, Verstappen beat Hamilton to the title with victory in the final race in Abu Dhabi. It was a controversial finale given the intervention of the race director, Michael Masi, and there has been further furore regarding Verstappen’s win on social media during the past couple of days, specifically in relation to radio messages delivered by Red Bull’s sporting director, Jonathan Wheatley, to Masi during the chaotic final lap in which Wheatley made suggestions as to how Masi should deal with lapped cars, further adding to the sense among many – Hamilton supporters especially – that the race director was influenced in Red Bull’s favour. However, the radio messages have been public since F1 released them on video four days after the race in December, and the FIA responded to the social media storm by noting it had already taken them into account as part of the inquiry into what went on in Abu Dhabi, the findings of which will be presented on Monday. “We are aware of this and it is part of the investigation,” read a statement from the governing body. Verstappen has been consistent in his stance that he won the title fair and square and, as he enters his eighth year in F1, the 24-year-old is more than ready to do battle again. “I am just looking forward to getting back in the car and start driving, to see how everything is handling,” he said. “Personally I feel good, what is important is you prepare yourself in the best way possible physically but in terms of the car we don’t know, so I am curious to see how it will behave on track.” Christian Horner, Red Bull’s team principal, is bullish about his driver’s chances. “Max was just phenomenal last year, an outstanding season for him,” he said. “His confidence is going to be sky high for 2022.”",Sport/Sport,Lando Norris extends his F1 contract with McLaren until 2025,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/09/lando-norris-extends-f1-contract-mclaren-max-verstappen
2/10/2022,"Julian Coman’s article quotes a list, from the Labour’s Covenant pamphlet, of the places we need to invest in “where people from different backgrounds, meet talk, argue and laugh” (Politicians may have forgotten about ‘community’, but British people haven’t, 7 February). While the list is commendable, public libraries are a surprising omission. Many people once saw them as the heart of the communities they served. They provide all the facilities that Coman outlines, but like the BBC they also inform, educate and entertain. However, in recent years they have fallen foul of Conservative policies. In the austerity forced on local government, around 800 places lost that beating heart. This has happened when people need to be made aware of the dangers of misrepresentation and misinformation: dangers that threaten personal and public decision-making and could destroy our democracy. More than ever, communities require access to trustworthy and reliable information that a professional library service can provide.  Moreover, the pandemic has clearly demonstrated that reading is perhaps more popular than ever. Communities still need the 21st-century equivalent of the Whitechapel library, recalled in Bernard Kops’s poem, where people including immigrants and working-class autodidacts found: “That door of the library was the door into me / And Lorca and Shelley said ‘Come to the feast.’ / Whitechapel Library, Aldgate East.”Bob UsherwoodEmeritus professor, University of Sheffield  Julian Coman’s encomium for “community” is vital and timely. He stresses the community of spirit, but there are structural changes that can greatly aid that spirit. One of the problems is that many parts of our cities and other urban areas have, through intrusive infill development, ceased to be “townships” and become suburbs. This effect can be mitigated in minor but noticeable ways, such as by having signage at community borders showing the historic name of that community and by developing voluntary initiatives that popularise community identity. Sports teams are particularly significant in increasing this. The other key initiative is to utilise the existing legislation to establish urban parishes. Very few neighbourhoods have done so – and they have been mainly in “posh” districts. If local authorities were committed to aiding such initiatives and using their administrative capacity to bring together myriad local community associations, there is every possibility of establishing many urban parishes that can then become focal points for community identity and activity.Michael MeadowcroftLeeds  Julian Coman’s article raised an important issue. Having witnessed and participated in many of Blair’s and Heseltine’s communitarian regeneration initiatives around Hackney, it is clear to me that Labour will have to change its ways and devolve power at a very deep level if it has any chance becoming the party of community. The closest it has ever come to this is during Livingstone’s first reign at the Greater London council, along with the Scarman-inspired urban programmes. It is from that experience, and the remnants of its positive effects that can still be found here, that we should now be learning.Adam HartCo-director, Vortex Jazz Foundation; former executive director (1996-2012), Hackney Co-operative Developments  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/10/2022,"Your editorial is correct in calling attention to the longstanding failure to fund enough training places for doctors and nurses (The Guardian view on repairing the NHS: ministers are the problem, 7 February). Last year, 59% of new registrations to the General Medical Council register in England had been trained by other countries, and this number continues to rise, highlighting how far short we are in fulfilling our commitment to the World Health Organization code of practice on the international recruitment of health personnel to ensure an adequate domestic supply of health workers so that we cease to weaken health systems in low-and middle-income countries by actively recruiting their precious doctors and nurses on such an industrial scale.  The number of medical student training places in the UK needs to double. This should not be as expensive to Treasury as feared, as the current putative costs are artificially set and do not reflect actual expenditure incurred by student training, either in the universities or in the health service.Prof Rachel JenkinsFormer director, WHO Collaborating Centre, King’s College London 1997-2012  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/10/2022,"Adrian Chiles rightly described Dylan Thomas’s grave as “an “extravagantly simple affair” in an overspill church graveyard in Laugharne (Do not go gentle into that hot tub! A luxury spa is the wrong way to remember Dylan Thomas, 3 February). Correspondence held by the National Archives in Kew reveals that Caitlin, Thomas’s widow, wrote to the Home Office in the 1950s requesting that his body be exhumed and reinterred in the garden of his boathouse overlooking the Taf estuary. Caitlin said that the modest cross in a “bleak extension” of a church graveyard was not fitting for “Wales’ foremost poet”.  The Home Office agreed to grant a licence (to give effect to her wishes) on application and payment of a £2 fee. Caitlin submitted an application but, for reasons unknown, never paid the £2 fee. So the Home Office took no further action and Dylan Thomas’s body remained where it was originally buried. Perhaps Caitlin came to believe that the humble church graveyard was a fitting resting place for her husband. After all, she lies there with him, and her name is also inscribed on that modest cross.Mike PenderCardiff  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/10/2022,"Re the energy price crisis (Letters, 6 February), by the time I put the kettle on in the morning, my house has already used £1 of electricity overnight. It is almost impossible to use less than 6 kilowatt-hours (kWh) a day even if you only run basics such as fridge, freezer, television, phone chargers etc. But a household running a bare minimum of appliances pays the same price for electricity as someone heating a swimming pool. More, in fact, because of the effect of the daily standing charge. One way to ensure that all households can afford a basic, essential level of usage would be to make the first 5 kWh of usage per day, per household very cheap (or even free, the equivalent of the tax-free income band). Then charge a progressively higher rate the more you use. And, like income tax, it would be progressive and redistributive without costing the exchequer a penny.Sue BeesleyDutton, Cheshire   Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
