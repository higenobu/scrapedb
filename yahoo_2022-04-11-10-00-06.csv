4/11/2022,"(Reuters) -Russia will take legal action if the West tries to force it to default on its sovereign debt, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told the pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper on Monday, sharpening Moscow's tone in its financial wrestle with the West. ""Of course we will sue, because we have taken all the necessary steps to ensure that investors receive their payments,"" Siluanov told the newspaper in an interview. ""We will present in court our bills confirming our efforts to pay both in foreign currency and in roubles. It will not be an easy process. We will have to very actively prove our case, despite all the difficulties."" Siluanov did not elaborate on Russia's legal options. Russia faces its first sovereign external default in more than a century after it made arrangements to make an international bond repayment in roubles earlier this week, even though the payment was due in U.S. dollars. Last week, Siluanov said Russia will do everything possible to make sure its creditors are paid. ""Russia tried in good faith to pay off external creditors,"" Siluanov said on Monday. ""Nevertheless, the deliberate policy of Western countries is to artificially create a man-made default by all means."" Siluanov said Russia's external liabilities amount to about 20% of the total public debt, which stood at about 21 trillion roubles ($261.7 billion). Of that, about 4.5-4.7 trillion roubles were external liabilities. Russia has not defaulted on its external debt since the aftermath of its 1917 revolution, but its bonds have now emerged as a flashpoint in its economic tussle with Western countries. A default was unimaginable until recently, with Russia rated as investment grade in the run up to its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" and which on Sunday intensified in eastern Ukraine. ""If an economic and financial war is waged against our country, we are forced to react, while still fulfilling all our obligations,"" Siluanov said. ""If we are not allowed to do it in foreign currency, we do it in roubles.""

4/11/2022,"Will Smith was banned from attending the Oscars and any other Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences event for the next decade, the academy announced Friday following a meeting to address Smith's slap of Chris Rock during the 94th Academy Awards last month. Smith slapped Rock after the presenter made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith’s bald head, referring to the 1997 film ""G.I. Jane,"" starring Demi Moore. Pinkett Smith, 50, has struggled with alopecia. In addition to the board's decision, Smith previously resigned from the academy. Here's a look at other Hollywood figures who have been banned from either attending the ceremony – similar to Smith – or from the academy altogether: WILL SMITH REACTS TO 10-YEAR OSCARS BAN Cinematographer Adam Kimmel was banned by the academy last year and removed as a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Kimmel, who is behind films like 2005's ""Capote"" and 1996's ""Beautiful Girls,"" was arrested in 2003 and pleaded guilty to rape in the third degree, Variety reported. As part of his sentencing, he had to register as a sex offender. FOLLOWING OSCAR SLAP, WILL SMITH IS ‘TRYING NOT TO PANIC,’ WORRIED OF ‘BEING FULLY CANCELED,’ SOURCE CLAIMS In a statement to the outlet at the time, Kimmel stated it was ""consensual sex with someone under the legal age of consent."" He was 43. The girl was under 17. In 2010, Kimmel was arrested again on charges of fourth-degree sexual assault, two counts of risk of injury and failing to register as a sex offender in Connecticut, according to the publication. Kimmel disputed the allegations but was convicted on the last charge. Variety noted this crime resulted in his removal from the Brad Pitt movie ""Moneyball."" In May 2018, the academy removed Roman Polanski as a member. Polanski, who won a best director Oscar for ""The Pianist"" in 2003, remains a fugitive after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a minor in 1977 and fleeing the United States the following year. He has been living in Europe since. WILL SMITH OSCAR CRISIS HANDLED BY INNER CIRCLE FIGHTING TO SAVE THE ACTOR'S BRAND He had been an academy member for nearly 50 years at the time of his expulsion, and his films had been nominated for 28 Oscars. Bill Cosby was given the boot at the same time as Polanski. In a statement at the time, the academy said that both men violated the organization's standards of conduct. ""The board continues to encourage ethical standards that require members to uphold the academy's values of respect for human dignity,"" the statement said. WILL SMITH’S OSCARS SLAP HAS BEEN A ‘NIGHTMARE’ FOR HIS FAMILY: REPORT The news came not long after a jury in Philadelphia reached a verdict in Cosby's retrial case for sexual assault. Cosby was found guilty of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand during a 2004 incident. The sex assault conviction was overturned by Pennsylvania’s highest court in 2021. The court said it had found an agreement with a previous prosecutor prevented Cosby from being charged in the case. Harvey Weinstein was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences in 2017. In a statement at the time, the board said, ""well in excess of the required two-thirds majority"" of its 54 members voted to dismiss Weinstein, co-founder of Miramax and The Weinstein Company. The expulsion was effective immediately. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER The decision came amid a slew of sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations. Weinstein has since been sentenced to 23 years in prison for third-degree rape and a criminal sex act. Weinstein has maintained he simply had consensual ""extramarital affairs"" with the victims. Weinstein still faces similar charges in California where he is awaiting trial. He has pleaded not guilty. In 2004, actor Carmine Caridi became the first person to have his academy membership revoked. The ""Godfather"" actor had loaned out award screener videos. ""I sent [them] to people, besides my brother and sister, who couldn’t afford them,"" Caridi said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. ""I made a lot of people happy."" The star died in 2019 at the age of 85. The late Gil Cates, who produced the 1993 Oscars, vowed to ban Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Gere had gone off script that year to protest China’s occupation of Tibet as well as the ""horrendous, horrendous human rights situation,"" while the latter two spoke out in support of Haitian refugees. All three were presenters. Sarandon and Robbins' ban has since been lifted. Gere returned to the Oscars stage in 2013.

4/11/2022,"PHOENIX (AP) — Karla Finocchio's slide into homelessness began when she split with her partner of 18 years and temporarily moved in with a cousin. The 55-year-old planned to use her $800-a-month disability check to get an apartment after back surgery. But she soon was sleeping in her old pickup protected by her German Shepherd mix Scrappy, unable to afford housing in Phoenix, where median monthly rents soared 33% during the coronavirus pandemic to over $1,220 for a one-bedroom, according to ApartmentList.com. Finocchio is one face of America’s graying homeless population, a rapidly expanding group of destitute and desperate people 50 and older suddenly without a permanent home after a job loss, divorce, family death or health crisis during a pandemic. “We’re seeing a huge boom in senior homelessness,” said Kendra Hendry, a caseworker at Arizona's largest shelter, where older people make up about 30% of those staying there. “These are not necessarily people who have mental illness or substance abuse problems. They are people being pushed into the streets by rising rents."" Academics project their numbers will nearly triple over the next decade, challenging policy makers from Los Angeles to New York to imagine new ideas for sheltering the last of the baby boomers as they get older, sicker and less able to pay spiraling rents. Advocates say much more housing is needed, especially for extremely low-income people. Navigating sidewalks in wheelchairs and walkers, the aging homeless have medical ages greater than their years, with mobility, cognitive and chronic problems like diabetes. Many contracted COVID-19 or couldn't work because of pandemic restrictions. “It’s so scary,” said Finocchio, her green eyes clouding with tears while sitting on the cushioned seat of her rolling walker. “I don’t want to be on the street in a wheelchair and living in a tent.” It was Finocchio's first time being homeless. She's now at Ozanam Manor, a transitional shelter the Society of St. Vincent de Paul runs in Phoenix for people 50 and up seeking permanent housing. At the 60-bed shelter, Finocchio sleeps in a college-style women’s dorm, with a single bed and small desk where she displays Scrappy’s photo. The dog with perky black ears is staying with Finocchio’s brother. A stroke started 67-year-old Army veteran Lovia Primous on his downward spiral, costing him his job and forcing him to sleep in his Honda Accord. He was referred to the transitional shelter after recovering from COVID-19. “Life has been hard,"" said Primous, who grew up on in a once- segregated African American neighborhood of south Phoenix. “I'm just trying to stay positive.” Cardelia Corley ended up on the streets of Los Angeles County after the hours at her telemarketing job were cut. Now 65, Corley said she was surprised to meet so many others who were also working, including a teacher and a nurse who lost her home following an illness. “I’d always worked, been successful, put my kid through college,” the single mother said. “And then all of a sudden things went downhill.” Corley traveled all night aboard buses and rode commuter trains to catch a cat nap. ""And then I would go to Union Station downtown and wash up in the bathroom,” said Corley. She recently moved into a small East Hollywood apartment with help from The People Concern, a Los Angeles nonprofit. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said in its 2017 Annual Homeless Assessment Report  the share of homeless people 50 and over in emergency shelters or transitional housing jumped from 22.9% in 2007 to 33.8% in 2017. More precise and recent nationwide figures aren’t available because HUD has since changed the methodology in the reports and lumps older people in with all adults over 25.. A 2019 study of aging homeless  people led by the University of Pennsylvania drew on 30 years of census data to project the U.S. population of people 65 and older experiencing homelessness will nearly triple from 40,000 to 106,000 by 2030, resulting in a public health crisis as their age-related medical problems multiply. Dr. Margot Kushel, a physician who directs the Center for Vulnerable Populations  at the University of California, San Francisco, said her  research in Oakland on how homelessness affects health has shown nearly half of the tens of thousands of older homeless people in the U.S. are on the streets for the first time. “We are seeing that retirement is no longer the golden dream,” said Kushel. ""A lot of the working poor are destined to retire onto the streets."" That’s especially true of younger baby boomers, now in their late 50s to late 60s, who don’t have pensions or 401(k) accounts. About half of both women and men ages 55 to 66 have no retirement savings, according to the census. Born between 1946 and 1964, baby boomers now number over 70 million, the census shows. With the oldest boomers in their mid 70s, all will hit age 65 by 2030. The aged homeless also tend to have smaller Social Security checks after years working off the books. A third of some 900 older homeless people in Phoenix said in a recent survey they have no income at all. Teresa Smith, CEO of the San Diego nonprofit Dreams for Change, said she's also noticed the homeless population is trending older. The group operates two safe parking lots for people living in cars. Susan, who stayed at one lot, spoke only if her last name wasn't used because of the stigma surrounding homelessness. The 63-year-old had kidney cancer while caring for her mother, then lost their two-bedroom apartment after her mom died. The cancer is now in remission. Susan slept in her car with her dog at one of the gated parking lots that provide a bathroom, showers and a shared refrigerator and microwave. She was stunned to see a man in his 80s living in a car there, calling it “just wrong.” But residents enjoyed the community, grilling meals together and even surprising one in their group with a birthday cake. Dreams for Change recently helped Susan get a one-bedroom apartment with a housing voucher after months of waiting. With a washer and dryer, patio, dishwasher and bathtub, “I feel like I’m at the Ritz,"" she said. Donald Whitehead Jr., executive director of the Washington-based advocacy group National Coalition for the Homeless, said that seeing older people sleep in cars and abandoned buildings should worry everyone. “We now accept these things that we would have been outraged about just 20 years ago,” said Whitehead. Whitehead said Black, Latino and Indigenous people who came of age in the 1980s amid recession and high unemployment rates are disproportionately represented among the homeless. Many nearing retirement never got well-paying jobs and didn't buy homes because of discriminatory real estate practices. “So many of us didn't put money into retirement programs, thinking that Social Security was going to take care of us,” said Rudy Soliz, 63, operations director for Justa Center, which offers meals, showers, a mail drop and other services to the aged homeless in Phoenix. The average monthly Social Security retirement payment as of December was $1,658. Many older homeless people have much smaller checks because they worked fewer years or earned less than others. People 65 and over with limited resources and who didn't work enough to earn retirement benefits may be eligible for Supplemental Security Income of $841 a month. Finocchio said limited contributions were made for her into Social Security and Medicare because most of her jobs were off the books in telephone sales or watering office plants. ""The programs approved by Congress to prevent destitution among the elderly and the disabled are not working,” said Dennis Culhane, a University of Pennsylvania professor who led the 2019 study of the aging homeless in New York, Boston and Los Angeles County. “And the problem is only going to get worse.” Jennifer Molinsky, project director for the Aging Society Program at Harvard University's  Joint Center for Housing Studies, agreed the federal government must do more to ensure older Americans are better housed. “The younger boomers were hit especially hard in the Great Recession, many losing their homes close to retirement,” Molinsky said. Longer term shelters specifically for older people are helping get some off the streets at least temporarily. The Arizona Department of Housing last year provided a $7.5 million block grant for the state’s largest shelter to buy an old hotel to temporarily house up to 170 older people without a place to stay. The city of Phoenix kicked in $4 million for renovations. CEO Lisa Glow of Central Arizona Shelter Services, which runs the state's biggest shelter in downtown Phoenix, said the hotel is expected to open by year’s end. Residents will stay around 90 days while caseworkers help find permanent housing “We need more dignified, safer and comfortable places for our seniors,” said Glow, noting that physical limitations make it difficult for older people at the 500-bed shelter downtown. Nestor Castro, 67, was luckier than many who lose permanent homes. Castro was in his late 50s living in New York when his mother died and he was hospitalized with bleeding ulcers, losing their apartment. He initially stayed with his sister in Boston, then for more than three years at a YMCA in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Just before last Christmas, Castro got a permanent subsidized apartment through Hearth Inc., a Boston nonprofit dedicated to ending homelessness among older adults. Residents pay 30% of their income to stay in one if Hearth's 228 units. Castro pays with part of his Social Security check and a part-time job. He also volunteers at a food pantry and a nonprofit that assists people with housing. “Housing is a big problem around here because they are building luxury apartments that no one can afford,” he said. “A place down the street is $3,068 a month for a studio.” Hearth Inc. CEO Mark Hinderlie said far more housing needs to be built and made affordable for the aged, especially now as the numbers of graying homeless people surge. “It’s cheaper to house people than leave them homeless,"" Hinderlie said. “You have to rethink what housing can be.” __ Janie Har in Marin County, California, and Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this report.",U.S./Associated Press,America's homeless ranks graying as more retire on streets,https://news.yahoo.com/americas-homeless-ranks-graying-more-152218213.html

4/11/2022,"Cathie Wood's ARK Invest has sold around 90% of its holdings in Twitter since the start of the year. So it missed out on the huge rally after Tesla boss Elon Musk revealed a majority stake in Twitter this week. Wood's stake in Twitter would now be worth $700 million if she had held onto all of it. Star stock-picker Cathie Wood has not had a great start to 2022. Her flagship ARK Innovation fund that won her fame and fortune in 2020 has lost 40% so far this year, compounding the 24% drop last year. Wood's funds shot to prominence in the pandemic, when tidal waves of cheap cash sent the kind of cutting-edge, speculative technology stocks she invests in into the stratosphere. Since then, as money conditions have tightened, interest rates have gone up and the tech sector has lost some of its luster, Wood's funds have struggled. Like any asset manager, ARK Invest regularly buys and sells stocks to manage its portfolio. This year, the company has sold around 90% of its holdings of micro-blogging platform Twitter — missing out on the huge rally that ensued after entrepreneur and Tesla boss Elon Musk revealed a majority stake in the company earlier this week. A filing with the securities regulator on April 4 showed Musk had bought a 9.2% stake in Twitter for around $3 billion, making him the company's largest shareholder. He subsequently joined the board. The news sent Twitter's shares up a full 27% on the day, to three-month highs near $55. The stock has since drifted back to around $47. But ARK had already sold most of its holdings even before Musk's revelation. ARK's funds held around 15.4 million Twitter shares at the very start of 2022, according to data from trading tracker Cathie's Ark. By April 7, that holding was closer to 1.3 million shares. Had ARK retained the stake in Twitter that it held at December 31, which accounted for about 2% of its portfolio, that holding would now be worth over $700 million, versus its current holdings' $62 million. Wood had previously invested heavily in Twitter. ARK notably bought more than 1 million shares worth almost $49 million after then-chief executive Jack Dorsey resigned at the end of November. Although she's whittled down ARK's holdings of Tesla, too, Wood remains a fan of the electric vehicle company, and believes Musk — the ultimate disruptor — has the potential to shake up Twitter's board. ""This could be setting up for another leadership change,"" she told Bloomberg Radio this week. The ARK Innovation fund experienced its worst drawdown in its history in January, when tech stocks got hammered and the Nasdaq 100 saw its biggest monthly drop in three years. The undervaluation in Ark's portfolio holdings ""reached an extreme I've never experienced in my career,"" Wood told ETF Trends at the time. But she remained optimistic. ""We truly believe that that rubber band will snap, and the performance will rebound,"" she said.

4/11/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia has tapped a new Ukraine war commander to take centralized control of the next phase of battle after its costly failures in the opening campaign and carnage for Ukrainian civilians. U.S. officials don't see one man making a difference in Moscow's prospects. Russia turned to Gen. Alexander Dvornikov, 60, one of Russia’s most experienced military officers and — according to U.S. officials — a general with a record of brutality against civilians in Syria and other war theaters. Up to now, Russia had no central war commander on the ground. The general's appointment was confirmed by a senior U.S. official who was not authorized to be identified and spoke on condition of anonymity. But the White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said “no appointment of any general can erase the fact that Russia has already faced a strategic failure in Ukraine.” “This general will just be another author of crimes and brutality against Ukrainian civilians,” Sullivan said. “And the United States, as I said before, is determined to do all that we can to support Ukrainians as they resist him and they resist the forces that he commands.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki echoed that thought. “The reports we’re seeing of a change in military leadership and putting a general in charge who was responsible for the brutality and the atrocities we saw in Syria shows that there’s going to be a continuation of what we’ve already seen on the ground in Ukraine and that’s what we are expecting,” she said. The decision to establish new battlefield leadership comes as Russia gears up for what is expected to be a large and more focused push to expand Russian control in Ukraine's east and south, including the Donbas, and follows a failed opening bid in the north to conquer Kyiv, the capital. Dvornikov gained prominence while leading the Russian group of forces in Syria, where Moscow has waged a military campaign to shore up President Bashar Assad’s regime during a devastating civil war. Dvornikov is a career military officer and has steadily risen through the ranks after starting as a platoon commander in 1982. He fought during the second war in Chechnya and took several top positions before being placed in charge of the Russian troops in Syria in 2015. Under Dvornikov’s command, Russian forces in Syria were known for crushing dissent in part by destroying cities, lobbing artillery and dropping what were often crudely made barrel bombs in sustained attacks that have displaced millions of Syrian civilians. The United Nations says the more than decade-long war has killed more than 350,000 people. In 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded Dvornikov the Hero of Russia medal, one of the country’s highest awards. Dvornikov has served as the commander of the Southern Military District since 2016. Lt. Col. Fares al-Bayoush, a Syrian army defector, said Sunday that while the situation in Syria is different than in Ukraine because the Russian military was fighting insurgent groups and not Ukraine's professional army, he expects a similar “scorched-earth” strategy. Al-Bayoush said he believes the aim of naming Dvornikov as Ukraine war commander is to turn the war into “rapid battles” in several places at the same time. “I expected him to use the scorched earth policy that was used in Syria,"" al-Bayoush said, referring to Russian-backed attacks in Syria in which cities and towns were put under long sieges while being subjected to intense bombardment that left many people dead and caused wide destruction to infrastructure and residential areas. “He has very good experience in this policy.” “This commander is a war criminal,” al-Bayoush said by telephone from Turkey. Since Russia joined the war in Syria in September 2015, Assad’s forces have taken control of most of the country after being on the verge of collapse. The Russian air force carried out thousands of airstrikes since, helping Russian-backed Syrian troops take areas after fighters were forced to choose between an amnesty in return for dropping their arms or being taken by buses into rebel-held areas. The last major Russian-backed offensive in Syria lasted several months, until March 2020, when a truce was reached between Russia and Turkey, which supported rival sides. Sullivan on Sunday said the Russian general has a record of brutality against civilians in Syria and “we can expect more of the same"" in Ukraine. But he stressed that the U.S. strategy remains the same in supporting Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “Our policy is unequivocal — that we will do whatever we can to help Ukraine succeed,” Sullivan said. “Which means that we need to keep giving them weapons so that they can make progress on the battlefield. And we need to keep giving them military support and strong economic sanctions to improve their position, their posture at the negotiating table."" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, meanwhile, spoke by video conference Sunday to a small number of Ukrainian troops in the U.S. who are now returning to their country. The group has been in the U.S. since last fall for military schooling and were given training on new drones the U.S. sent to Ukraine last week for the war with Russia. Austin thanked the Ukrainian troop members for their courage and service and pledged continued U.S. support and security aid, according to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. Kirby said the small group was given some advanced tactical training, including on the Switchblade armed kamakazi drones, as well as instruction on patrol craft operations, communications and maintenance. In an interview Saturday with The Associated Press, Zelenskyy acknowledged that despite his hopes for peace, he must be “realistic” about the prospects for a swift resolution given that negotiations have so far been limited to low-level talks that do not include Putin. Zelenskyy renewed his plea for more weapons before an expected surge in fighting in the country’s east. He said, with frustration in regards to supplies of weapons from the U.S. and other Western nations, “of course it’s not enough.” Sullivan spoke on CNN's “State of the Union” and NBC's “Meet the Press. Psaki spoke on ”Fox News Sunday."" ___ Associated Press writers Bassem Mroue in Beirut and Ellen Knickmeyer in Washington contributed to this report.",World/Associated Press,US doubts new Russian war chief can end Moscow's floundering,https://news.yahoo.com/us-official-russia-appoints-ukraine-142216330.html
