1/1/2022,"In a tweet, House judiciary committee GOP members questioned COVID booster shots. ""If the booster shots work, why don't they work?"" said the tweet. Ranking committee member Rep. Jim Jordan has long pushed COVID misinformation. Republican members of the House judiciary committee have questioned the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination booster shots as cases of the Omicron variant continue to spread across the US. ""If the booster shots work, why don't they work?"" tweeted the official account of the 19 Republican members of the committee, whose ranking member is Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. In the tweet, the members don't describe their grounds for questioning the effectiveness of the booster. A follow-up tweet linked to an ABC News report on record numbers of COVID infections in the US due to the Omicron surge. â€”House Judiciary GOP (@JudiciaryGOP) December 30, 2021 Jordan has long promoted misinformation about COVID and opposed vaccine mandates. In December, he claimed that ""real America"" was ""done"" with COVID-19. He is one of several Republicans on the right-wing of the party who've rallied around opposition to Biden administration measures to contain the virus and questioned its severity. But the disease continues to claim thousands of lives in the US daily, and there are growing concerns about the capacity of hospitals to cope with a new surge in patients sick with the fast-spreading Omicron variant, which is highly contagious and evades some vaccine protections. On its website, the CDC says that the vaccine's ""effectiveness at preventing infection or severe illness wanes over time"" and that a booster is necessary to shore up the body's defenses against the disease. ""The recent emergence of the Omicron variant further emphasizes the importance of vaccination, boosters, and prevention efforts needed to protect against COVID-19."" Jordan is an ally of former president Donald Trump. But Trump has provoked anger among some allies by advocating the vaccines. He was booed by some supporters at a recent event for saying he had himself gotten a booster shot. Insider's Cheryl Teh reported that several factions of the right-wing were furious after Trump lauded the COVID-19 vaccines.

1/1/2022,"The 1,600-acre Marshall Fire burning near Boulder, Colorado, has destroyed an estimated 500 homes in the city of Superior and continues to threaten more as winds preceding a much-anticipated snowstorm caused the state's latest catastrophic wildfire Thursday. Here's what we learned about the fire from a 5 p.m. press conference. Follow this link for updated coverage from USA TODAY reporters on scene as additional information becomes available. The fire, named for its proximity to the unincorporated community of Marshall, is believed to be caused by power lines that were damaged by strong winds that gusted up to 110 mph midday Thursday. Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said deputies confirmed power lines were downed in the area Thursday. Pelle said the fire was ""consuming football field lengths in seconds,"" and called it ""a horrific event."" More: How you can help those impacted by the Marshall and Middle Fork fires in Boulder County In the 5 p.m. press conference, Pelle said all 370 homes in Superior's Sagamore subdivision are believed to have burned, along with a potential 210 in the 13,000-resident town's Old Town neighborhood. Also burned were a Target shopping center and hotel. Pelle said additional structures in the Marshall area west of superior are believed to be consumed by the fire. Pelle on Thursday said that a firefighter suffered a minor eye injury due to flying debris, but that as of 5 p.m. no deaths had been attributed to the fire. However, Pelle said he ""would not be surprised if there are injuries or fatalities"" due to how fast the fire burned through populated areas. Pelle said there have been no people confirmed to be missing in the fire area, in response to a reporter's question. Six people were hospitalized with burns at UCHealth Broomfield Hospital, spokeswoman Kelli Christensen told USA TODAY. She could not elaborate on their conditions or the severity of burns due to HIPAA, a healthcare privacy law, but said all six were being treated currently. Emergency officials will begin damage assessments when feasible, possibly as early as Thursday, depending on conditions. Firefighters from across Colorado, including those from Poudre Fire Authority in Fort Collins, have responded to help local firefighting crews in Boulder County. Thursday's high winds meant that firefighting aircraft were unable to fly, and would likely remain grounded until daybreak Friday. What's believed to be Colorado's first nighttime aerial firefighting mission ended in tragedy earlier this year when pilot Marc Thor Olson was killed in a crash battling the Kruger Rock Fire near Estes Park. Pelle requested 12, two-member National Guard teams in to assist with the fire, with that request granted Thursday. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis also announced a state of emergency during the fire, which was approved by the federal government, freeing up additional resources to respond to the fire and help those impacted.

1/1/2022,"By Jose Torres TAPACHULA, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexican officials dismantled a makeshift migrant camp in the country's south near the Guatemalan border on Thursday, government officials and Reuters witnesses said. Many of the migrants, some families with children, had been waiting in Tapachula camp for months, which some described as a ""prison"" due to the squalid or cramped conditions. Mexican authorities have used the camp to contain migrants and restrict their movement. Before officials disbanded the camp in Tapachula, about 3,000 migrants were granted permission by Mexico's National Migration Institute (INM) to process their travel documents, which would allow them to leave the camp. Migrants, mostly from Central America and the Caribbean, left the camp after INM officals gave them a QR code, registering them to complete their ""regularization"" process. They will now have a month to complete their visa process, which could include applying for asylum, in one of 14 states, according to a government official and migrants who showed Reuters their documents. Migrants will need to find their own housing. ""I am going to Sinaloa to get the humanitarian visa with my own resources,"" said a woman from Cuba who declined to give her name. She said she stayed at the camp for more than two weeks waiting on her QR code so she could continue on her way to the United States. Mexico accelerated the transfer of tens of thousands of migrants to various regions this month, promising to regularize their stay amid a record number of people arriving in the country in 2021 with the aim of crossing the border into the United States. There were, however, dozens of migrants who said they had not received a QR code on Thursday, but were still forced to leave the camp. It is unclear if housing assistance will be provided. Lester Centeno, 25, a migrant from Nicaragua, said he arrived in Tapachula seeking asylum but didn't get a QR code or a transfer to another region. ""They told me they were going to deport me if I didn't leave here (from the camp),"" Centeno said, referring to immigration agents.
