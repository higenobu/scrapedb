Even if they beat Brentford and Ralf Rangnick’s team win their final two games they can only equal their lowest ever total of 64 points in the competition and this is with a far more expensive squad than David Moyes had when his 34-league game tenure of 2013-14 ended on that mark.

With a trip to Anfield next up and a potential showdown with Arsenal at home on the horizon anything less than victory against a Leicester side distracted by the return leg against Roma in the Europa Conference League on Thursday could prove terminal.

4/30/2022,"I’m old enough to have watched the grainy TV images of the first moon landings by Apollo 11 in 1969. I can never look at the moon without recalling this heroic exploit. It was achieved only 12 years after the first object, Sputnik-1, was launched into orbit. Had that momentum been maintained, there would surely have been footprints on Mars a decade or two later. That’s what many of our generation expected. However, this was the era of the space race between the United States and the USSR, when Nasa absorbed up to 4% of the US federal budget. Once that race was won, there was no motivation for continuing this huge expenditure. To young people today, these exploits are ancient history. Yet space technology has burgeoned. We depend on satellites every day, for communication, weather forecasting, surveillance and satnav. Robotic probes to other planets have beamed back pictures of varied and distinctive worlds; several have landed on Mars. And telescopes in space have revolutionised our knowledge of the cosmos. What’s more, humanity, or rather a narrow sliver of us, may be on the verge of an era of space exploration that makes the moon landings seem parochial by comparison. The last visitors to the moon – Harrison Schmitt and Eugene Cernan, on Apollo 17 – returned in 1972. During the subsequent 50 years, human spaceflight has seemingly regressed: hundreds have ventured into space but, anticlimactically, none has done more than circle the Earth in low orbit, mainly in the International Space Station (ISS). The scientific and technical payoff from the ISS isn’t trivial, but it has been less cost-effective than robotic missions. Nor are these voyages inspiring in the way that the pioneering Soviet and US adventures were. The space shuttle was, until its decommissioning, the main vehicle for transporting people to and from the ISS. It failed twice in 135 launches. Astronauts or test pilots would willingly accept this level of risk – less than 2%. But the shuttle had, unwisely, been promoted as a safe vehicle for civilians (a female schoolteacher, Christa McAuliffe was one of the casualties of the Challenger disaster in 1986). Each failure caused a national trauma in the US and was followed by a hiatus while costly efforts were made, with very limited effect, to reduce risks still further. During this century, our whole solar system will be explored by flotillas of miniaturised probes. These technologies are far more advanced than Nasa’s wonderful Cassini probe, which was launched nearly 25 years ago on a seven-year journey, and spent 13 years exploring Saturn and its moons. In coming years, robotic fabricators may assemble vast lightweight structures in space: huge, gossamer-thin mirrors, for telescopes or solar energy collectors, perhaps using raw materials mined from the moon or asteroids. Such robots could repair spacecraft even in high orbits. Advances in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) are eroding the need for humans in space. The fact that the Apollo 17 astronaut Schmitt was a geologist enabled him to gather especially interesting samples of lunar rocks and soil. But future probes to Mars will be able to make such choices themselves. If you can get a robot to do it, why send a human at all? Nonetheless, I hope people do follow the robots – as adventurers, rather than for practical goals. Private-enterprise ventures such as SpaceX and Blue Origin have brought a Silicon Valley culture into a domain long dominated by Nasa and a few aerospace conglomerates. They have managed to improve rocketry and cut costs. Moreover, they can be less risk-averse than Nasa, and still find volunteers willing to tolerate higher risks than a western government could impose on publicly funded civilian astronauts. So it’s these cut-price ventures – with private sponsorship, rather than public money – that should be at the forefront of human space travel. The phrase “space tourism” should be avoided. It lulls people into believing that such ventures are routine and low-risk. And if that’s the perception, the inevitable accidents will be as traumatic as those of the space shuttle were. These exploits must be “promoted” as dangerous sports or intrepid exploration. Later this century, courageous thrill-seekers – in the mould of, say, Ranulph Fiennes or the early polar explorers – may well establish “bases” independent of the Earth. Elon Musk, the richest man on the planet, himself says he wants to die on Mars – but not on impact. But what is the longer-range goal? Musk and my late colleague Stephen Hawking envisaged that the first “settlers” on Mars would be followed by literally millions of others. But this is a dangerous delusion. Coping with the climate crisis is a doddle compared to terraforming Mars. Nowhere in our solar system offers an environment even as clement as the top of Everest. There will be no “planet B” for most of us. But I still want to cheer on those pioneer “Martians” because they will have a pivotal role in shaping what happens in the 22nd century and beyond. This is because the pioneer settlers – ill-adapted to their new habitats – will have a more compelling incentive than those of us on Earth to literally redesign themselves. They’ll harness the super-powerful genetic and cyborg technologies that will be developed in coming decades. These techniques will be, one hopes, heavily regulated on Earth – but those on Mars will be far beyond the clutches of the regulators. We should wish them luck in modifying their progeny to adapt to alien environments. This might be the first step towards divergence into a new species. It’s these space-faring adventurers, not those of us contentedly adapted to life on Earth, who will spearhead the post-human era. It’s perhaps in deep space – not on Earth, or even on Mars – that non-biological “brains” may develop powers that humans can’t even imagine. The sun will survive six billion more years before its fuel runs out. And the expanding universe will continue far longer – perhaps for ever. So even if intelligent life had originated only on the Earth, it need not remain a trivial feature of the cosmos: it could jump-start a diaspora whereby ever more complex intelligence spreads through the whole galaxy. Interstellar – or even intergalactic – voyages would hold no terrors for near-immortals. Even though we are not the terminal branch of an evolutionary tree, we humans could claim truly cosmic significance for jump-starting the transition to electronic entities, spreading our influence far beyond the Earth. But this raises a further question: will our remote progeny be the first intelligences to spread through the galaxy? Or will they encounter something already out there, whose origins lie on a planet around an older star where evolution had a head start over us?

4/30/2022,"The sensitive-skinned are often fearful of active skincare ingredients, and they have some reason to be. It’s fairly common for retinol in particular to cause some redness in the early weeks of use, especially on skin already affected by rosacea, acne, menopause or general sensitivity. My skin is like asbestos (thankfully, since it allows me to do my job), but even I find my neck, eyelids and a little patch under my mouth invariably object to any new course of retinoids. This is so common as to almost be expected – but there is a very effective way of dealing with it. It’s called buffering, and I recommend it to anyone starting to use an unfamiliar active-ingredient product. The idea is to reverse your night-time routine by laying down a gentle, cushioning, bland-ish moisturiser (normally your last step), before applying your retinol. Think of your skin as a mattress and this innocuous cream as a mattress protector, shielding it from anything laid on top. If your skin is generally sensitive, use the moisturiser everywhere your retinol will later go. If it’s more hardy, focus on anywhere with creases and crevices in the skin (eyelids, neck, between the nose and cheek, for example), as in these places the ingredient will pool and sit overnight, making irritation more likely. Apply the moisturiser to the creases, the way a decorator might apply masking tape to skirting boards before painting a wall. You can use any lotion or cream you like, but I favour something with ceramides and hyaluronic acid. CeraVe PM Facial Moisturising Lotion (£13.50) is great and reasonably priced, but any pharmaceutical-type brand specialising in sensitive skin – Avène, La Roche Posay, Eucerin or Vichy for example – will generally be a safe bet. Placing a physical buffer between face and retinol will weaken the impact of the active ingredient, exposing tetchier areas to less concentrated amounts. Skin will acclimatise over time: you may feel you can lose the buffer altogether in a few weeks, but there’s no harm in using one for ever if you don’t. Buffering like this quickly becomes second nature. My bedtime routine is simple: cleanser, moisturising buffer to eyes and neck, then a retinoid everywhere over the top. It works like a charm in preventing flare-ups, and makes using retinoids – proven, effective, reliable but undeniably daunting – a relative breeze.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Active ingredients irritate your skin?

4/30/2022,"There have been blue skies and plenty of sunshine in New York this week but, as soon as you step outside, a cold bite in the air feels jolting. In a similar way all the lavish positivity surrounding Saturday night’s historic fight at Madison Square Garden will assume a chilling edge as the first bell rings. When Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano leave the safety of their corners, the serious danger of boxing at the very highest level will wipe away all the polite and admirable words they have shared. Taylor is undefeated as a professional, having won all 20 of her fights, and she enters the ring as the undisputed world lightweight champion and the No 1 in the pound-for-pound rankings. Serrano, meanwhile, has lost only once in 44 bouts and that solitary defeat came 10 years ago this week when she was outpointed in Sweden by Frida Wallberg. The Puerto Rican has won world titles in seven different weight categories in a staggering statistic which also reveals the paucity of competition which has blighted women’s boxing until recently. But Serrano looks immensely hungry because she has not had the plaudits or purses Taylor has accumulated. Claressa Shields and Savannah Marshall will meet in another huge fight for women’s boxing this summer. But Taylor and Serrano are still acknowledged as the best two female fighters in the world. Unlike the younger middleweights, who can be feisty and spiteful towards each other, Taylor and Serrano are deeply respectful. That respect stems from a clear sense of the jeopardy surrounding this fight for both women. For the first time in her lauded career Taylor is the marginal underdog – at least in America where there is a groundswell of opinion she will not be able to withstand Serrano’s speed and ferocity. Taylor has been far from her best in her two most recent bouts against the awkward Jennifer Han and the unheralded Firuza Sharipova. But she was affected by a calf injury and she was not especially motivated against limited opposition. There is some logic in the tendency to think that Taylor is on the slide for she has had over 200 bouts as a dominant amateur and a celebrated professional. In the last two years she also shipped real punishment in gruelling victories over Delphine Persoon, twice, and Natasha Jonas. Taylor is 35 and even great fighters are in decline at such an age. But she has been calm and purposeful all week and there is a gathering belief that Taylor could produce one more landmark performance when it matters most. Taylor normally loathes attention but she has embraced the build-up to this historic fight. She and Serrano are the first women to headline a promotion at the Garden and the first female fighters to make $1m each for a single bout. Taylor insists she is ready to produce something extraordinary. Yet she will need to be extremely wary. Serrano is at her most dangerous in the first four rounds and, being two years younger than Taylor, seemingly the fresher fighter after so many easy pro contests. Taylor is the superior boxer but she is not the female answer to Willie Pep or Pernell Whitaker. She can’t resist standing and trading and to do that against Serrano, especially early on, would be hazardous. In her last fight, against Sharipova, Taylor left herself worryingly open. She will need far more discipline against Serrano. At Thursday’s final press conference Jake Paul, who promotes Serrano, goaded Eddie Hearn. Paul seemed so confident Serrano will win he said: “I’ve got a bet for you, Eddie.” “I’m not getting a tattoo,” quipped Hearn, who promotes Taylor. Paul was willing to bet all his clanking jewellery on Serrano. Hearn made another joke about how he had hoped for something less cheap. Paul responded with a demand they have a $500,000 bet and, while Hearn grinned and wavered, the YouTube star suddenly doubled the stakes to a million. Hearn nodded and, after some provocation, finally swapped handshakes with Paul – who then promised he would give his million to Serrano when she wins. Of course this is boxing and two schemers like Hearn and Paul could easily have cooked up the wheeze as a way of cranking up further interest. Taylor smiled politely. As a staunch Christian she abhors gambling and turned down a huge sponsorship offer from a betting company. She also has more serious business on her mind. Eighteen thousands fans will be crammed into a sold-out Garden, with at least a quarter of them having flown in from Ireland. The Puerto Rican contingent will be out in force but it’s likely that the Irish-American fight community in New York will tip the balance of support in Taylor’s favour. In a more equitable way, the Empire State Building a few blocks away will be lit up all Saturday night by both the Irish and Puerto Rican flags. It is a sign of how seriously New York, and all of boxing, is taking this potential battle for the ages.

4/30/2022,"Our most enduring images and memories of film noir tend to be rooted in the 1940s and 1950s: say the words and monochromatic visions of fedoras, slinky satin gowns and unrestricted billows of cigarette smoke inevitably come to mind. That makes it a difficult genre to tackle in the present day, even if its themes and social corners are hardly era-specific. Lean too hard into the period styling and it feels like empty cosplay; update it too much and the shadowy romance dissipates. Guillermo del Toro’s snaky, seductive remake of Nightmare Alley (now on all major VOD platforms) gets the balance just about right, even if its early-40s production and costume design is sumptuous in a way that Edmund Goulding’s 1947 original, still among the darkest and harshest of all classic noirs, never thought to be. Expensively dilapidated and luridly lit, Del Toro’s film indulges in a degree of genre fetishism, never less than when Cate Blanchett is on the screen, sheathed and hairsprayed and vamping up a storm as a venomous femme-fatale psychoanalyst. But it retains a genuine jolt of human corruption and moral curiosity, all held in Bradley Cooper’s remarkable lead performance as an ambitious, cool-blooded carnival worker willing himself into high society at any cost. Cooper wears a fedora and high-waisted suit well enough, but his character’s tortured interior life never feels dressed in quotation marks. Nightmare Alley struts with a conviction similar to Curtis Hanson’s pitch-perfect LA Confidential (Amazon) – now 25 years old but so convincingly immersed in its period and aesthetic that it feels at once far older and fresh as a daisy. This black-hearted, acid-tongued adaptation of James Ellroy’s labyrinthine saga of police rot wasn’t a remake of any classic property: it simply feels like it should always have been around, given the rich, seamy textures of its mid-century Hollywood world-building and the fluency of its all-star cast in jazzy, witty noir patter. Hanson’s film came out one year after Lee Tamahori’s similarly styled, similarly plotted and little-remembered Mulholland Falls (Amazon), a suitably moody, enjoyable diversion in which every actor nonetheless seems to be striking and holding a pose. Del Toro’s film also breaks a bad-luck streak for film-makers reimagining already beloved examples of the genre: undistinguished 1970s remakes of The Big Sleep and Double Indemnity have been forgotten for a reason. But Bob Rafelson’s spiky, steamy 1981 take on The Postman Always Rings Twice (Google Play) holds up better than sneering critics might have predicted at the time. Not setting out to improve on Tay Garnett’s lean, mean 1946 original, it instead focuses on what its predecessor could not: explicit carnal energy between stars Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange. And Steven Soderbergh’s sinuous, underrated The Underneath (Apple TV) successfully remade its noir source (Robert Siodmak’s 1949 Criss Cross) by situating it in a particular milieu of mid-90s urban American murk, crisp chiaroscuros replaced with bilious neon lights. Younger film-makers are more comfortable lifting the tenets of film noir into brightly lit, unrecognisably different 21st-century worlds: see Rian Johnson’s ingenious melding of the noir moral code with high-school politics in Brick (2005; Chili), or David Robert Mitchell’s divisively eccentric, wandering Under the Silver Lake (2018; Mubi), in which millennial anxiety keeps derailing its Los Angeleno mystery. In today’s cinema, there’s more than one way to keep noir from fading to grey. Turning Red(Disney)Now available on DVD and Blu-ray for the benefit of non-Disney+ subscribers, this thoughtful, kind-hearted coming-of-ager from Pixar breaks with their frenetic storytelling formula to explore more tender adolescent realities with just the right amount of metaphorical cleverness. Strangely denied a cinema release, it’s one of the studio’s smartest recent efforts. Wolf(Universal)The premise is intriguing: Jacob (a committed George MacKay) believes himself a wolf trapped in a man’s body, finally meeting a kindred spirit while in therapy. But Nathalie Biancheri’s morose film is too concerned with moral binaries to have much impact as the gender dysphoria allegory it keeps suggesting. Jackass Forever(Paramount)Speaking of untamed, the crew of onetime MTV pranksters are (mostly) back together, and middle age has seemingly brought them no wisdom. Which is exactly what you’d hope for from a reunion of Johnny Knoxville et al: their shtick remains unchanged, even as a few friends have been lost along the way, lending a sort of noble defiance to their arrested development.",Arts/Film,Nightmare Alley and the best modern film noirs,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/30/nightmare-alley-and-the-best-modern-film-noirs-guillermo-del-toro
4/30/2022,"The world’s space agencies should scrap plans to send astronauts to the moon and Mars and leave them to explorers and billionaires who can privately fund and risk such adventures, the astronomer royal says. Lord Martin Rees said technical improvements and more sophisticated artificial intelligence meant robotic missions were becoming ever more capable of exploration, and even construction, in space, making it unnecessary for space agencies to front far-flung human missions. “We should not have publicly funded programmes to send people to the moon, still less to Mars,” said Rees. “It’s hugely risky, hugely expensive, and there’s no practical or scientific benefit to sending humans. It’s a pretty bad bargain for the taxpayer.” His comments prompted a robust defence from some experts, who stressed that government-backed spacefaring is a way to project soft power and provided huge inspiration, adding that the private sector could turn space into the “wild west”. But Rees argues we should encourage and cheer on explorers and billionaire entrepreneurs who want to leave Earth in search of adventure in the spirit of Shackleton and Scott – both of whom died on Antarctic expeditions. The SpaceX founder, Elon Musk, has long enthused about moving to Mars, noting “there’s a good chance of death”. While human genetic modification should be heavily regulated on Earth, Rees said, Mars settlers would be free to enhance their children to cope with life on the red planet. Doing so could drive the divergence of the species, he added, raising the unsettling prospect of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs being the seed stock for a bunch of puny post-humans, given the weak Martian gravity. “They will have every incentive to try to redesign themselves and these changes are going to be rapid compared with Darwinian evolution,” Rees said. “If something evolves that’s rather different from present day human beings, it’s likely to evolve from them, not us.” Astronauts last set foot on the moon half a century ago. Since then, humans have not ventured further than a few hundred miles into space, mostly to the International Space Station. Space agencies, including from the US, Europe, China and Russia, are now on course to return to the moon. Mars is next in line. The cost is considerable because humans are fragile. The US president, Joe Biden, has requested $26bn (£20.6bn) for Nasa in 2023, with $7.5bn earmarked for the Artemis programme which aims to put the first woman and the first person of colour on the moon as early as 2025. “I think many people support the idea of science in space and assume humans are an essential part of that. In a way they are, because an astronaut knows more geology than a present-day robot,” Rees said. “But the kinds of robots we will send in 20 years may be able to decide where to dig on Mars as well as any actual geologist could.” Closer to Earth, Rees fears the phrase “space tourism” underplays the danger in the activity. He wants it rebranded as high-risk adventure so inevitable tragedies do not become national traumas, as happened when Nasa lost space shuttles in 1986 and 2003. Even brief trips to the edge of space, such as those planned by Virgin Galactic, are risky. “There are going to be crashes even on these suborbital flights, and they’ll be less traumatic and seem less of a disaster if they are viewed in the way of someone falling off Everest, rather than a civilian airliner crash,” he said. The astronomer, who argues the case in a new book, The End of Astronauts, believes private spacefarers will inspire people as much as space agency astronauts. But others are sceptical. Prof David Southwood, a former chair of the UK Space Agency and senior research investigator at Imperial College, said: “If you’ve ever been in a room with Tim Peake and a couple of hundred schoolchildren, there’s a buzz and enthusiasm because he’s done something very few people have done, out on the final frontier. They think ‘he’s like me’. You don’t have to be a billionaire.” Didier Schmitt, the head of the strategy and coordination group for robotic and human exploration at the European Space Agency, said the trend for human spaceflight being used as soft power and power projection would continue. “The robotic versus human spaceflight rhetoric is an old debate that has definitely been superseded by the US and Chinese new race for the moon and Mars,” he said. Leaving human exploration to the private sector risked “a wild west approach in space”, he added, stressing it was important to balance private exploitation with public exploration in space. “It is a duty for governments, and not the free market, to enthuse the younger generation,” he added. “Taking into account the 22,500 candidates for the next European Space Agency astronaut corps is a clear message to politicians.”",News/Science,"Leave space missions to billionaires and robots, says astronomer royal",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/30/leave-space-missions-to-billionaires-and-robots-says-astronomer-royal
4/30/2022,"Racism rooted in slavery, colonialism and apartheid is responsible for higher Covid death rates among people of African and Asian descent, as well as Roma and Indigenous peoples, a UN body has said. That the vast majority of Covid-19 vaccines were administered in high and upper-middle-income countries replicated “slavery and colonial-era racial hierarchies”, according to the committee on the elimination of racial discrimination (Cerd). The committee said a failure to redress injustices has denied basic human rights to health and worsened discrimination and exclusion. In a strongly worded statement released on Friday, the group said it was concerned that the pandemic’s disproportionate impact “is in significant part attributed to consequences of the historic racial injustices of slavery and colonialism that remain largely unaccounted for today”. The unequal distribution of vaccines between and within countries “manifests as a global system privileging those former colonial powers to the detriment of formerly colonised states and descendants of enslaved groups,” the statement added. As of April 2022, only 15.21% of low-income country populations has received one vaccine dose. Peruth Nabirye from EqualHealth, a global healthcare campaign, said it was important to hold countries where pharmaceutical companies are located accountable for fostering health inequities. She said: “We are still tied up in systems of injustice and we are at the mercy of the global north to save our lives.” The Cerd statement singled out the UK, Germany and Switzerland for continuing to block a waiver on lifting intellectual property rules that would enable the redistribution and scaling-up of the Covid response. India and South Africa first proposed the temporary waiver on WTO rules for intellectual property in October 2020. Meena Jagannath, director of global programmes at Movement Law Lab and coordinator of the Global Network of Movement Lawyers, said: “It is unacceptable for states to privilege intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical companies over the human rights of people.” She added: “The decision to side with pharma has deepened racial discrimination that is the product of unaddressed policies of colonialism and slavery.” Cerd is a body of independent experts that monitors how member states implement the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, adopted in December 1965. Under the convention, member states – including the UK – are charged with eliminating all forms of racial inequity and ensuring equality without discrimination on the grounds of “race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin”.",News/Global development,Covid vaccine inequity due to racism rooted in ‘slavery and colonialism’,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/30/covid-vaccine-inequity-due-to-racism-rooted-in-slavery-and-colonialism

Capacity for the dinner at the Washington Hilton hotel is more than 2,600 and it is fully booked but the specter of Covid-19 has not entirely lifted.

Although guests on Saturday are required to provide proof of vaccination and same day negative test, Biden, 79, will not be there for the eating portion of the dinner and his top adviser on the coronavirus, Anthony Fauci, 81, decided not to attend “because of my individual assessment of my personal risk”. Sally Quinn, 80, an author, journalist and socialite, is also staying away. “I can’t imagine going into a room with 2,600 people in this day of Covid,” she said. “Covid is not over, as we learned from the Gridiron, and it’s only gotten worse in Washington since then, so it’s just got to be a super spreader. It’s not worth dying for, that’s for sure.” The occasion allows the 106-year-old White House Correspondents’ Association to present reporting awards, honor freedom of speech and raise money for scholarships. But the flashy dinner has become a subject of morbid fascination for its earnest schmoozing and perceived narcissism. Quinn, widow of Ben Bradlee, former editor of the Washington Post, recalled: “It was this journalistic event and then it got way out of hand, all about celebrities and being seen and the comedy. It seemed to lose its point and, toward the end of the Obama administration, it became grotesque. It was ridiculous and embarrassing.” Among the celebrities present in 2011 was Trump. He was mercilessly lampooned by Obama, who even displayed a pastiche of what the White House would look like if – as then seemed unimaginable – the reality TV star became president one day. Journalist Steve Clemons, who sitting at the next table and watching Trump’s reactions, recalled: “He was not laughing at all. He was as grim and as stern looking as could be. It is rumored – and he has said it – that his decision to run for president happened on that night when Barack Obama mocked him.” In 2018, comedian Michelle Wolf’s after-dinner routine savaged Trump administration officials sitting just feet away and was condemned by some for going too far. Some observers hope that the break and return of the sitting president offer a chance to lower the temperature. Clemons, editor-at-large of Semafor, a new media company, said: “The tension that began to grow between the president, whoever the entertainment was, and all of this drama became a little bit too unglued and unmoored from the fundamental celebration of what journalism is supposed to be.” He added: “The president is supposed to be there to essentially embrace the fact that we are holding him to account. It’s supposed to be light hearted. A lot of people misread this as chumminess and there certainly is chumminess on the evening but it doesn’t mean that you’re not teaching people about critical thinking and objective distance reporting in journalism.” When Obama attended the dinners, the audience was often treated to spoof videos that co-starred Biden, who was then vice-president and seemed to relish a comic turn with his beloved cars and sunglasses. Clemons, who has been attending the event since the 1990s, observed: “They were like Veep episodes that they were creating. Joe Biden really loves this dinner. Even if he hated the press corps, he would still do this dinner.” Biden will be expected to make fun of political rivals and deliver topical one-liners. Finding humor in a pandemic that has killed nearly a million Americans, or in the Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, could be dangerous territory. The dinner also typically features a roast of the president by an entertainer. This year South African Trevor Noah, host of Comedy Central’s Daily Show, will face one of the toughest audiences for any comedian: a mix of Democrats, Republicans, liberal and conservative journalists and celebrities who will not necessarily all laugh at the same jokes. Quinn added: “It’s very tricky because a lot of them have bombed or they’ve got too mean or they’ve just not been funny. I would suspect Trevor Noah will be pretty good, but there’s no predicting because even really good people just bomb sometimes if their jokes aren’t good. “Also, I would think that the tone of this is going to be not as much hilarity since there is the war in Ukraine, Covid, inflation, fires are raging in New Mexico and the world is going to hell. The eat, drink and be merry idea is a little off key.” She is not the only one avoiding the dinner for one reason or another. Asked whether it is safe for Biden to attend, David Axelrod, a former chief strategist for Obama, told the New York Times: “Well, there is a question of whether it’s EVER appropriate to engage in an exercise in gaudy, celebrity-drenched self-adulation, but that’s a separate question.”",News/US news,Return of the ‘nerd prom’: Covid-19 and Ukraine war loom over White House correspondents’ dinner,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/30/white-house-correspondents-dinner-2022-joe-biden
4/30/2022,"Iam standing outside an ordinary house in a tree-lined street on a midsummer afternoon, about to change my life. I glance through a window and see the reassuring domestic ephemera of books, a computer monitor, a child’s drawing. Next to the front door is a small, typed sign with the details of a psychotherapist. I draw myself up, feeling both grown up and childishly nervous, and ring the buzzer. It is June 2012, and I am nearing 38. The country is preoccupied with whether the Olympics will be ready on time and if England might crash out of the Euros. I have other things on my mind. A few weeks earlier, I made a call. The woman on the end of the line was polite, warm and to the point, and we agreed to meet. Waiting for her to answer the door, I start to sweat: will I like her? Will she think I am a time-waster? What am I going to say? I feel like an outlier: in 2012, therapy carries something of a stigma. Beyond one or two close friends, I haven’t told anyone I’m here. The open conversations we have today around mental health weren’t happening. Now, Covid has sharpened everyone’s awareness of their own mental health struggles: according to a report by Mind last November, over a third of Britons say they don’t have the support or tools to deal with the ups and downs of life. Ten million people will need support for their mental health as a direct result of the pandemic, according to the Centre for Mental Health. Demand for therapy is outstripping supply. A study by the New York Times in December revealed that therapists in the US, where it has always been more accepted, are turning away patients. Even in the UK, demand for mental health advice has soared since the start of the pandemic. It hasn’t taken a crisis for me to seek help. I’m doing so because I feel stuck: at work, in life, and certainly in love. I feel there is a braver, happier, more fulfilled person inside me trying to get out, but I don’t know how to reach her. I am existing with a low-level frustration, without being able to pinpoint what I am frustrated with, let alone find the tools to address it. I have been wondering for a while if talking to a professional might help. But something has always stopped me: who am I, with a loving family, good friends, a roof over my head and food on the table, to need therapy? I don’t come from a family of therapy-seekers. My Yorkshire-born parents, from working-class homes, would no sooner have sought out something so self-indulgent than joined a circus. In the world I’ve grown up in, therapy is seen as a rather shameful last resort for someone in need of help, not for someone with a functioning life who’s feeling a bit directionless. Just cheer up and get on with it was the message I learned. As a result, it has taken me a long time to convince myself that, even though I am not suffering from what my friend (and also a therapist) Ellen calls “capital T trauma”, it could be helpful. As Stephen Grosz writes in his 2013 book The Examined Life: “At one time or another, most of us have felt trapped by things we find ourselves thinking or doing, caught by our own impulses or foolish choices; ensnared in some unhappiness or fear; imprisoned by our own history. We feel unable to go forward and yet we believe that there must be a way.” I want to change. In fact, I want to be a different person altogether. I am like an old house whose electrics keep shorting in the same place, and I want someone to rewire me. I have a very strong sense that unless I do something, I’ll be stuck here for ever. So here I am, sweating on a doorstep, asking for help. I am about to learn a huge amount. As I sit down for my first session, I notice a box of tissues on a table within arm’s reach. I get through a lot of them that afternoon. The release of talking, of being listened to, is an emotional experience. We sit in a book-filled room; I am on a comfy sofa, my therapist is on a chair. Light pours in. Over the years, I can almost memorise the titles behind her, so long will I spend gazing at them when stuck for words. Likewise, the tree outside her window becomes as familiar as the view from my own flat: I will witness its full cycle – from summer fullness to bare winter branches – many times over. In these early weeks, I do a lot of talking as my therapist gets to know me. When she speaks, it is often to affirm what I’ve said: “It sounds like you’ve always … ” or, “It’s OK to feel … ” At first I sit upright; as I start to feel more comfortable, I sometimes curl my legs under me. My therapist refers to the talking we do, week in, week out, as “work”. There’s a reason for this – it’s hard. Many sessions, particularly in these early days, are emotionally battering, tearful, and leave me feeling wrung out for days. But therapeutic tears feel different from normal-life tears. They often appear out of the blue. They are real, but they are confined to the session, leaving me feeling a little shellshocked afterwards: “Where did that come from?” I think. When I sob about something, my therapist is sympathetic, but instead of comforting me, she is detached enough to be curious about my tears, what they reveal. They are like a truth-seeking missile, a direct line to what really matters. It is during one of these tearful moments that I acknowledge how much I want to be a mother, despite the fact that I am single. And so we start to talk about what I could do. She challenges me: is it that I don’t believe I could cope as a single parent, or is it that I feel I must fit in with society’s norms? Do I want to wait until I’m in a good relationship – which could take years – or does this feel more urgent? Over a period of months, my ingrained prejudices start to shift, and my perspective changes. I take a few baby steps – an appointment with a fertility clinic; a checkup with my GP – telling myself that, at any point, I can pull the plug. I never do: nearly two years after our first session, in April 2014, I give birth to a daughter. It’s the best decision I’ve ever made. I assume I might have a few months of sessions over the summer to iron out some issues, then call it a day, like taking myself to a garage for an MOT. But because I haven’t sought out therapy after a big T trauma – a divorce, a bereavement, a breakdown – I realise that, after nearly four decades of ingrained behaviour, there is no sudden U-turn; rather, I’m like a large tanker slowly starting to alter its course. By autumn, I realise I may be here some time. The early weeks zip by; I feel euphoric, my sessions filled with wave after wave of insights, revelatory eureka moments of “so that’s why I’ve always done that!” But then things quieten down. Sessions sometimes feel like a waste of time; I feel grumpy and frustrated. This, I’ve read, is when the hard, unsexy work happens. A therapist is part detective, part archaeologist, scratching at the surface, finding something of potential interest and digging a little deeper. These quieter, less emotional sessions are where the deep excavation takes place. We start to work as a team, trying to piece things together, make connections. Meanwhile, in the real world, life starts to get a little easier. One day, I ask for something at work that, almost overnight, makes my job more interesting and rewarding. This real-world application of my therapy makes all the hard work feel worthwhile. I learn never to second-guess a session, however. Out of the blue, I have one that leaves me feeling not just that a weight has been lifted, but that a large blockage inside me has been surgically removed. But then I realise that, of course, these breakthroughs come out of all the plodding, apparently unsatisfying work of the previous months. Before I start therapy, I am vaguely aware – from TV shows, from the little I know about Freud – that most therapists root around in your past. I am sceptical about this: how relevant can it be? I want to dive straight into my pressing present-day issues. Delving into my childhood feels distracting and time-consuming. Yet, from our very first session, my therapist and I start to make connections between how I experienced the world as a child and how I experience it today. Surprise, surprise – they aren’t too dissimilar. We survive (in the broadest sense) our childhoods by figuring out how to fit into our families, our roles, our small world; we learn about relationships from our parents. We then carry these ways of being into our adult lives where, in many cases, they are no longer useful, or relevant. To me, this joining-the-dots seems like magic. To understand that there is a sound reason why I behave a certain way is revelatory, exhilarating and a huge relief: it’s like finding a key for a door that has been locked your entire life. An example: I wonder regularly why I have often been unsure how I feel about things. It’s frustrating: feelings should be instinctual, clearcut – yet I have always struggled to articulate and trust mine. We realise they weren’t discussed, taken seriously or explored, growing up. It’s hard work challenging this deeply held belief. I mean, absolutely do, at first – Philip Larkin was right, they fuck you up. So every frustration at my behaviour, every flaw in my character, every life skill I feel I lack, I lay the blame at my parents’ door. It feels good at first, as it lets me off the hook; I don’t have to take responsibility for my failings. But after a while it starts to feel a bit pointless, a bit immature. It’s a therapeutic dead end. As time goes on, I realise something blindingly obvious: my parents had to make do with their parents. Perhaps I should have recalled Larkin’s second verse: “But they were fucked up in their turn/By fools in old-style hats and coats.” I loved my grandparents, but they didn’t arm their children with the skills and language to navigate the world of emotions. Once this truth is established, it leads to more interesting conversations. Understanding that I’m not flawed – or, more accurately, that we all are, so get over it – and that I must dictate what shape my life takes gives me the freedom to think about the choices I could make in future. I’m lucky to have the parents I do. But they are too emotionally involved to be objective about me. A neutral, professional therapist is a great counterpart. I hope to arm my daughter with as many life skills as I can, but I’ll no doubt screw her up in my own special way. This phrase is bandied about so freely in self-help articles and on fridge magnets, it has almost lost its meaning. But for me, it is core to it all. I have always felt unfinished, not-yet-perfect, and that if I could become a bit more confident, a bit less self-conscious, then I would be ready to launch into the world, fully formed – and then I would find contentment, fulfilment and love. As I half-suspect before I start therapy, it turns out I’m spectacularly misguided about this desire for a wholesale personality transplant. At the end of our first session, my therapist asks me if I’d ever considered that someone – a partner, a parent, a friend, a boss – might accept me exactly as I am, flaws, insecurities and all (I call this the Bridget Jones school of therapy). I never have. It is a revelation. The cliche goes that therapists nod their heads wisely and say: “And how did that make you feel?” They do say this sometimes; and in fact, when no one has ever asked you this question before, it’s extremely powerful when they do, repeatedly. This repetition, in my case, starts to have an effect: it makes me see that my feelings are valid; they aren’t right or wrong – they just are. But my therapist rarely asks that question, mostly because it is implicit in everything we talk about. Instead, she regularly asks a more powerful one: “What’s that good for?” At first, I don’t understand what she means. What is choosing an unavailable man good for? Well, nothing, obviously. But what she actually means is, what purpose does it serve? He’ll never commit to a relationship with me, I venture. And what’s that good for, she asks, half-smiling. It keeps me from having an intimate, grownup relationship, I say. Which keeps me from risking being hurt by someone I actually care about. And so on. Today, I ask myself this question all the time. What is keeping quiet about a work frustration good for? It stops me having to push myself, and potentially make higher-profile mistakes. What is my insistence that my daughter clear her plate good for? It makes me feel I can control her – and therefore feel in control as a parent. There’s always an explanation. If a therapy session is a mirror of the outside world and how we exist in it, then I clearly don’t know when to shut up. A therapeutic silence is worse than a real-life silence – it is unnaturally awkward sitting opposite someone while they stare at you, waiting for you to speak – so I fill all of them. Of course, this is a trick I know from my own world: silences are often when the juiciest things come out, as any journalist who regularly does interviews will tell you. But it takes courage to sit with it. If you are constantly filling silences to avoid their awkwardness, you are, I’ve learned, avoiding something else – an intimacy, a genuine thought, an ability to feel a little exposed. The hardest silences in therapy are those at the start of each session. It’s an unspoken rule that you, rather than your therapist, start off. Often what you first say is revealing – and can dictate that entire week’s conversation. For me, this pressure feels unbearable. So I mitigate it by trying to turn up “prepared” – with a good yarn, or running through our last session in my head, planning what to say when I arrive. My therapist challenges me on it: what might happen if I don’t prepare and instead just see what happens? What’s my biggest fear? That I will say something trite or embarrassing, I say. That I’ll be “found out” for being stupid, or for not having done my homework. Do you often feel like this, she asks – needing to be the good girl, for fear of what people might think of you? You bet I do. Sometimes, of course, I am just stumped for words. I stare out of the window; I fidget; I smile apologetically; I talk about the weather, or I compliment my therapist on something she’s wearing. It is agonising. She nods politely, quietly scrutinising me. After a while, she puts me out of my misery and says: “What’s happening for you right now?” It’s a question we don’t often ask ourselves, checking in with the present moment, and it’s surprisingly helpful. The first few times she says it, I talk about something that happened in the week, or a future plan. When I do, she stops me gently and says, “No, right now. What’s happening for you right now?” The truth is, I often don’t know, because I don’t think about it. But when I do speak honestly, what I say usually surprises me. “I am really, really pissed off,” I say. I am shocked. Once it has been voiced, we work backwards to figure out what I’m so pissed off about. It’s been 10 years since that warm June afternoon. After a decade of talking with my therapist, my life has changed immeasurably for the better. I’m a mother, I’m more confident and fulfilled at work than I’ve ever been, and I’m more than 18 months into a stable, loving relationship with an exceptionally good man. A lack of self-worth, a fear of taking up too much space, a fear of expressing how I feel, that have all accompanied me since girlhood, have lifted. Some of this is the simple fact of ageing. But mostly it is thanks to the power of my weekly conversations. But I am stopping. Therapy is a powerful means to an end, and it has armed me with the skills, in effect, to be my own therapist. As we wind down, I am curious to see how I feel, and what I will miss about it. My relationship with my therapist is a strange, one-sided one: I know almost nothing about her, yet she knows everything about me, from my darkest fears to my most shameful thoughts. I am forever amazed at how much she remembers – stories I’ve told her, the names of obscure family members. We are close, in some ways, but it’s not a friendship. I wonder aloud if she will miss me; she volunteers that she will. We are human beings, too, she says. Therapy hasn’t “fixed” me, because I wasn’t broken. It has helped me access and make sense of my thoughts, feelings and actions. Now the end is approaching, have I run out of problems? Will I never again suffer moments of self-doubt, or get tongue-tied in intimate conversations? Of course not. But my therapy has helped me confront and understand them – and given me the tools to tackle them. If you’d like to hear this piece narrated, listen to The Guardian’s new podcast, Weekend.

4/30/2022,"A professional career in theatre was not always on the cards for Marisha Wallace. The Broadway and West End star, who was born and raised on a pig farm in North Carolina, rarely saw people that looked like her on stage. As she takes on the coveted role of Ado Annie in the revival of Oklahoma! at London’s Young Vic theatre, Wallace is on a singular mission to call out the lack of plus-sized black actors on stage and to inspire young girls just like her. “It’s a role I never thought I could play because it’s usually played by very thin white women,” Wallace said. “Ado Annie is the town’s object of love and affection so to have a plus-sized black woman playing her is incredible, I’d never seen it on stage before. “I know it’s going to inspire a lot of women out there who may feel like their body type or how they look isn’t accepted or worthy of love.” Wallace, 36, first played Ado Annie in an all-black version of Oklahoma! in the US, the first time she was cast in a lead role. “I remember it changed my whole life. It was like, ‘Wow, I don’t have to be the random black girl who sings and then leaves and no one ever knows what ever happened to her’.” The actor and singer, who has starred in stage hits including Aladdin, Dreamgirls and Hairspray, as well as onscreen in Netflix’s Feel Good, said the new “sexy” Oklahoma! was a reimagination of the show for the 21st century. It even inspired show runners from HBO’s Euphoria to include Oklahoma! in their plot. “When we walk outside we don’t see all the same race, gender or body type,” Wallace said. “So why does our theatre and our art not reflect that? I think that’s what’s key to keeping theatre alive. “As a little black kid, I was never like, ‘I’m gonna go to theatre’, it didn’t feel like it belonged to me. So I want to grant accessibility to everyone.” That accessibility is reflected in Wallace’s Instagram which is full of funny and affirmative videos of her rehearsing, trying on outfits or messing around in the gym. It is a rare insight into the life of theatre stars who might feel more removed from younger, online audiences. “Everyone gets to see us on stage and they don’t see how the sausage is made,” she said. “I thought it was really important to have a presence on social media because there’s other people out there that are like me and maybe come from a small town. Maybe they don’t really know that they can have a job as a professional actress full-time.” For Wallace, it’s serendipitous that she ended up in Oklahoma!, a show she said is close to her heart. “I was the granddaughter of a hog farmer. We had all kinds of crops. We raised pigs and then they would be sent off, it was like Charlotte’s Web.” While her family were musical – they owned the church on the corner of their small town, where her father played every instrument, her mother was a choir director, her sister played the drums, and her brother played piano – they never pursued it professionally. “I was the first one to ever take it out of the church and into the world. I had this amazing teacher who trained me on weekends. She even took me on her own teacher’s salary to see a Broadway show. If it wasn’t for her, I wouldn’t have gotten into this at all,” said Wallace. Wallace’s work to inspire others does not begin and end on stage. She fronted a Charlotte Tilbury campaign “which showed beauty comes in all forms” and during the lockdown, released a cover of Annie’s Tomorrow to raise funds for performers out of work during the pandemic. The song went viral, reaching No 2 in the UK download charts, with Michael Ball playing it regularly on his BBC radio show. Decca Records, which represents Diana Ross, Shirley Bassey and Gregory Porter, offered her a record deal, and she spent last September touring her album. She performed Tomorrow for the Queen at the Royal Variety Show, and the cast of RuPaul’s UK Drag Race did a version of the track. This summer, Wallace and her band will open for Simply Red as well as Michael Ball and Alfie Boe across multiple venues. “I know what it’s like when you don’t have a job for two weeks, let alone two years,” she said. “I did the recording of Tomorrow in my living room while I was at one of my lowest times. I was feeling like I was getting some headway in my career and it all came to a halt. And I just needed something to give me some hope.”",Arts/Stage,"Theatres need more plus-sized black actors, says Broadway and West End star",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/30/marisha-wallace-plus-sized-actors-theatre
4/30/2022,"Jude Rogers’s The Sound of Being Human begins in January 1984. She is five years old and standing at the front door of her parents’ house in south Wales. Her father is about to leave for what should be a routine hospital surgery. He’ll be gone for five days – a lifetime for someone that young. Still, five days. Like him – because of him – she loves pop radio. The new Top 40 will be announced the following day. “Let me know who gets to No 1,” he says. He died, just 33, a couple of days later. Years go by, decades. Often, at moments she can’t anticipate, in ways she can’t always grasp, she finds herself caught short, lonely. Music becomes a crutch for Rogers. A community – or at least a notion of one. She thinks about the songs she and her father shared. The songs they might have shared. In pop she discovers father figures, fantasies of escape, ways to feel less unmoored. She grew up in small towns before the era of the internet. Pop seemed miraculous then, a kind of abduction. She chances upon a copy of Smash Hits – all funfair colours and splashy exclamation marks – in a local newsagent: “It lifted me above the red-tops, the black-and-blue Biros, the duplicate receipts books, the faded toys on the carousel, the sun-blasted birthday cards, the old boxes of penny sweets.” She progresses to buying REM bootleg tapes from a grimy record fair held in a hotel showroom “next to the market that sold polystyrene pots of cockles and laverbread”. Later, Rogers starts writing about music for the Llanelli Star, much-missed fanzine Smoke: A London Peculiar, the Word magazine (started by former Smash Hits editors). She’s not interested in hyping up the new, new thing or in being cool – she likes Yazz as much as Atari Teenage Riot, Kylie Minogue and Boards of Canada. Her sentences are warm, enthusiastic, hugs from a much-missed friend. She recalls throwing a pair of knickers (with Biro’d phone number) at Jarvis Cocker, dancing all night to Kraftwerk, Orbital and Daft Punk at Tribal Gathering in the late 1990s (high, not on speed or ecstasy but coffee and an egg bap), breaking up with a boyfriend at Digbeth coach station to the soundtrack of David Essex’s A Winter’s Tale. At the heart of The Sound of Being Human is Rogers’s hunger to find out why and how music has the power it does. Her chapters take the form of “tracks” – among them Abba’s Super Trouper, Shirley Collins’s Gilderoy and Talk Talk’s April 5th – that serve as cues for learning about music’s ability to detonate memories, feed self-expression, help in parenting. She also racks up hours at the British Library and speaks to sociologists, psychologists, neuroscientists, anthropologists. They, in turn, talk to her about the brain’s subcortical structures, dopamine pathways, synaptic connections, the anterior cingulate cortex. Few of them speak with the punchy eloquence of musician Richard Norris, who says he loves a meditative drone because “when your brain’s concentrating on one thing, it’s probably cutting off something, isn’t it?”. Rogers is alive to pop’s giddy powers, its ability to intoxicate and unreel. She even mentions a neuroscientist who used an MRI scanner to show that the same parts of the brain are aroused by music as orgasms. At the same time, she values music for the ballast and security it can provide, form in a world that seems formless, hope in a darkened heart. Her favourite song, she says, may well be Martha and the Vandellas’ Heat Wave: “The joy I find in Heat Wave is its cycle of doubt and delight, worry and wonder. In the chorus, Martha sings about not being able to stop crying, but sounds like she’s almost relishing that release.” It’s been for ever since I read a book less jaded about music than The Sound of Being Human. There are no scandals here. Scant mention of streaming or business. Instead, music is treated as a balm, a torch of memory, an Esperanto of the human heart. Music education in the UK, long underfunded and more buffeted still during Covid, needs an ambassador; Rogers, so contagiously ardent, would be perfect.
