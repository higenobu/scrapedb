12/23/2021,"NSW’s laissez-faire premier, Dominic Perrottet, has found himself mugged by reality on the cusp of Christmas. Here are the grim statistics that tell us what is happening in NSW: 5,715 new cases reported on Thursday; 1,500 health workers sick or isolating (leaving the health system even more stressed); rising Covid cases in ICU and nearly 150,000 people a day lining up to get tested.  Yes, some of these are travellers, who are required to be tested by other states. But most are people who worry they have been exposed and are now wondering whether they should attend Christmas Day with parents or grandparents. In the three weeks since the Omicron variant was first detected here on 28 November, Perrottet has been telling us to go out and spend, head to the pub, get back to normal. A week ago, NSW dropped its last remaining restrictions on mask-wearing, mandatory QR code check-ins and venue capacity limits. “Personal responsibility” was Perrottet’s main mantra. “Living with the virus” was his backup. He even did a gawky media picture opportunity at a pub, downing a schooner. Perrottet’s subtext was that people who wanted the rules on wearing masks indoors to remain – or the continuance of QR codes – were all for NSW being a nanny state. The Liberal premier was backed this week by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, who after national cabinet brushed off the idea of pushing for mask mandates. Premiers and chief ministers would make their own decisions about how best to promote masks, Morrison said, adding that some leaders “like to use mandates” and others “rely on the individual responsibility to achieve that”. “What matters is that people wear them, not whether people get fined,” Morrison said. Most people are wearing masks in retail settings in NSW. But, and here’s the kicker, the problem is the 15-20% who are not. As health authorities have stated, mask-wearing is particularly effective at stopping people who have the virus from breathing it onto others, and somewhat effective at stopping a person breathing in the virus. So dampening transmission depends on everyone doing it. “Implementation of mask-wearing measures should occur prior to Omicron case escalation to have maximum benefit,” recommended the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC). Social distancing helps as well. But how do you do this when the venue owner allows hundreds in, as they are entitled to do in Perrottet’s NSW. NSW scrapped most restrictions on 15 December – just in time to see the Omicron variant run rampant in the lead up to Christmas. Masks indoors are now being mandated again from midnight. Density caps are back on 27 December. QR code check-ins are being reinstated too. The irony for many businesses hoping a pro-business Perrottet would be good for business is it’s too late: staff are already ill or isolating, patrons are staying at home for fear of getting Covid, travel has been cancelled. The virus is hitting young people, with over 70% of cases among the 10 to 39-year-old cohort. They are the ones who have been going to crowded nightclubs and bars – just as Perrottet encouraged them to do. Many young people are now trying to address the risks they have taken since restrictions were relaxed by Perrottet by getting tested at clinics or doing rapid antigen tests, which are all but sold out. So what did Perrottet say on Thursday when backflipping on the easing of restrictions? “[Use] personal responsibility and common sense and be cautious over the Christmas break.” But he also wants some people to stop getting tested. “If you don’t need a test, don’t get one, because it always delays the turnaround time,” he said. “That’s affecting interstate flights and travel and affecting things like surgeries.” The state’s somewhat sidelined chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, made a rare appearance with Perrottet on Thursday. She said the new advice was to get tested if you had symptoms or if directed by NSW Health. NSW is also redefining “close contacts” to include only household contacts, contact with people in high-risk settings such as aged care, hospitals and indigenous communities or if the health department contacts you. Perhaps Perrottet has sensed the public mood, finally. It’s one of worry – that NSW is out of control, that cases are skyrocketing, as has happened in the UK, many parts of Europe, and the US. My prediction is there will now be more urgent backtracking from Perrottet. The health minister, Brad Hazzard, did not rule out restrictions on New Year gatherings. Cancelling elective surgery is also being discussed. The spread of the virus is already baked into the next two weeks’ case numbers. Expect NSW to quickly reach 10,000 cases a day. What changes the transmission rate (and case numbers) is changes in behaviour – and that depends on leadership from the top. No matter what the premker says. What determines the stress on the hospital system – the government’s new measure of how we are living with the virus – is case numbers and staffing. Both are going in the wrong direction. The past week of no restrictions will be rued as a lost week in the fight against the impact of Omicron. Perrottet could well learn the hard way that “letting it rip” in the interests of the economy comes at a high cost.",News/Australia news,Dominic Perrottet has finally realised that ‘letting it rip’ comes at too a high cost | Anne Davies,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/23/dominic-perrottet-has-finally-realised-that-letting-it-rip-comes-at-too-a-high-cost-for-all-of-us
12/23/2021,"Kate Winslet will be ready in a sec. “I’m just going to put some more eyedrops on my stye,” she says. Blame her intense crime drama Mare of Easttown, one of the TV hits of the pandemic. “It was quite a stressful job, and about nine weeks in I got three styes in my left eye, the third of which turned into a solid little marble and had to be cut out. But I pushed on. On with the show!” In it, she plays DS Mare Sheehan, who is raising her grandson, coping with her son’s suicide, and trying to solve the murder of a young mother in a working-class Philadelphia suburb. All without makeup: Mare is more likely to reach for a Cheeto topped with a squirt of spray cheese than anything in the Max Factor range. “The discussion about how Mare looked blew my mind,” says Winslet. The 46-year-old actor is speaking by phone from the West Sussex home she shares with her husband, Ned Abel Smith, and their seven-year-old son Bear, as well as her two children from previous marriages: 21-year-old Mia by her first husband, Jim Threapleton, and 17-year-old Joe by her second, the director Sam Mendes. “People were asking, ‘Did she gain weight? Didn’t she look frumpy? Wasn’t that brave of her?’ But why should that be brave? I suppose because it’s not how leading actresses are represented. Maybe Mare will be the tipping point, and we’re going to stop scrutinising women on screen quite so much.”  Realism extended to every corner of the show. “We were always saying on set: ‘That’s too TV. Keep it real.’ I’d constantly be rubbing Marmite into the knees of my jeans, or scuffing up my sneakers with a Brillo pad. You can’t just make one thing feel real: it has to be everything.” Take Mare’s car. “She would have been driving her grandson to and from kindergarten, feeding him breakfast on the fly. I know what the floor in the back of my own car looks like – there’s crushed cereal, with bowls and spoons clinking around, because we’ve had breakfast on the school run. You’re sitting on crumbs which are so embedded in the seat it would take a fucking blowtorch to get them out!” This is Winslet’s shtick: she may be a seven-time Oscar nominee (she won in 2008 for the Holocaust drama The Reader) and a double Emmy-winner (for two HBO shows, Mildred Pierce and now Mare of Easttown) but she remains the star who’s a slob like us. It’s a persona that chimes perfectly with Mare – Winslet intervened to ensure that publicity pictures weren’t airbrushed to make her look more presentable – as well as with our times. “Mare is how most of us felt through lockdown,” she says. “She validated the permanent pyjama look.” Inadvertently or otherwise, Winslet became almost the face of the pandemic. As reports of coronavirus spread at the start of last year, her 2011 disaster movie Contagion, in which she plays an epidemiologist, shot to the top of the streaming charts. Three months later, she and several Contagion co-stars, including Matt Damon and Marion Cotillard, presented public information videos. Winslet became a kind of Covid Vera Lynn, jollying people along by teaching us how to wash our hands, cough into the crooks of our arms, and deploy the word “fomite” correctly. During the interminable third lockdown, she gave two outstanding performances: first as the 19th-century palaeontologist Mary Anning in Ammonite, and then in Mare of Easttown. Both characters force Winslet to play against her natural warmth: it’s more than an hour into Ammonite before Mary smiles, while Mare doesn’t laugh until episode five. “I took some of what I learned on Ammonite into Mare,” she says. “That brooding stillness. It’s hard for me because I’m a joyful, busy, active, huggy person. That’s who I am.” The scripts for Mare of Easttown arrived one by one while she and Saoirse Ronan were shooting Ammonite on the Dorset coast. “I’d say: ‘Oh my God, episode five just came in’, then Saoirse would go” – and here Winslet slips into her co-star’s breathless Irish lilt – “‘Jesus fooking Christ, this is so exciting, you’ve gotta tell me what happens!’” Audiences turned out to be every bit as enthusiastic. “It came along just as people badly needed something to discuss other than who they knew who had died from Covid. It put families on couches, and there was a nostalgic quality to the one-episode-a-week format. It gets conversation going while you’re waiting for the next one.” Winslet’s own fondest TV memories from growing up in Reading, Berkshire, revolve around exactly those kinds of cliffhangers. “You’d desperately want to know what would happen to Zammo next on Grange Hill, or to the Fowlers in EastEnders.” Is she a binger now? “Covid has taught me how to binge. In more ways than one. But yes, Ned and I watched Ted Lasso pretty much back-to-back. Covid made you not feel so bad about hanging out on the couch.” It would be wrong to suggest that Mare of Easttown has catered simply to a nostalgia for delayed gratification when there is so much else to praise it for, not least its female characters. “Middle-aged women have long been underestimated, disrespected and disregarded in the film and television community, and now that’s changing,” she says. “Look at the actresses who won at the Emmys. None of us were in our 20s by any means, and that’s cool! I feel way cooler as a fortysomething actress than I ever imagined I would.” She also felt a deeper connection between herself and the character than she has done on previous jobs. “I knew Mare and this world vividly. I grew up in a tiny terraced house in a working-class, small-town community where your life overlaps with your neighbours’ lives just because the walls are so thin. If Lorraine down the road had her varicose veins done, the entire world knew. And if, for the first time ever, the couple two streets across voted Conservative instead of Labour then – bloody hell! – all shit went off in our house, and my parents would be debating whether they ought to talk to those people about their choices. This wasn’t a teeny-tiny cul-de-sac. It was the Oxford Road. If I was standing in my parents’ bedroom, I could be eye-to-eye with the people on the top deck of the No 17 bus.” Winslet is proud of Mare of Easttown’s focus on community; the whodunnit element may be the motor, but it’s the milieu that makes the show feel so salty and rich. There is also far less emphasis on damaged female bodies than audiences have come to expect from crime drama. “You’re right, we did show less,” she says. “In the morgue scene, we had a dummy that was an exact replica of the actress’s body and we were even respectful of that. Between takes we would cover the dummy with a sheet.” For all the show’s sensitivity, its vision of the police as uniformly caring, conscientious and true feels antiquated in light of the murders of George Floyd and Sarah Everard, to choose only the most shocking recent examples of police criminality. Shouldn’t television reflect the fact that the police badge is not necessarily a reassuring or honourable symbol? “I don’t know if I’m going to be playing Mare again,” Winslet says. “But if we were to do a second season, then for sure these atrocities which have existed in the police force here and in America will find their way into the stories we tell. One hundred per cent. You can’t pretend these things haven’t happened.” She sighs. “It’s horrible, isn’t it? This moment in time. It’s horrific. You can hear me, I can’t quite find the words because we all feel so betrayed and powerless. We have to turn this moment into something meaningful. We have to use our voices on behalf of people who don’t have one. That matters to me now in ways that hadn’t even crossed my mind in my 20s.” Possibly, she had other things to think about. Her 20s began, after all, with Titanic. “Do you know Leo just turned 47?” she asks, suddenly shocked. Then her voice grows wistful as she thinks back to herself and DiCaprio as pups. “I turned 21 on that shoot, and Leo turned 22,” she says. I tell her that when I met DiCaprio back then, he complained to me about Titanic’s arduous production and how miserable he felt. She lets out a raucous laugh. “I remember! I remember that he was! It wasn’t pleasant for any of us, but we were all in it together. Though he had way more days off than I ever bloody did. I guess I was raised to be grateful and just get on with it. I didn’t feel it was my right to be miserable, and if I was miserable I certainly would not have let a journalist know.” She is laughing again. “There is no way I would have let that slip!” She and DiCaprio later played a troubled married couple in Revolutionary Road and met again in Los Angeles recently for the first time in three years. “I couldn’t stop crying,” says Winslet. “I’ve known him for half my life! It’s not as if I’ve found myself in New York or he’s been in London and there’s been a chance to have dinner or grab a coffee and a catchup. We haven’t been able to leave our countries. Like so many friendships globally, we’ve missed each other because of Covid. He’s my friend, my really close friend. We’re bonded for life.” Were she sitting in front of me now, I get the impression she might appear to have something in her eye. Or perhaps it would just be the drops.",Arts/Television & radio,Kate Winslet: ‘I feel way cooler as a fortysomething actress than I ever imagined’,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/23/kate-winslet-i-feel-way-cooler-as-a-fortysomething-actress-than-i-ever-imagined
12/23/2021,"1) The best moment for British sport in 2021? It’s very likely to be Emma Raducanu winning the US Open, becoming the first qualifier to capture a grand slam title. That’s with apologies to Mark Cavendish, who came back from almost retiring from racing to win four stages at the Tour de France and the green jersey and become, alongside Eddy Merckx, the winner of the most stages at Le Tour, where the GC winner was the irresistible Tadej Pogacar. At the Tokyo Olympics, Team GB won a mighty 65 medals, finishing fourth in the medals table, 2) The social team at the Olympics have kindly edited together a 10-minute clip of some of the best moments of Tokyo 2020. Here’s the opening ceremony, and the closing ceremony, too, both taking place in front of an empty Olympic Stadium. For the host nation perhaps the women’s skateboarding was the highlight, with two 13-year-olds medallists and a 16-year-old, too. And world records in both the men’s and the women’s 400m hurdles finals from Karsten Warholm and Sydney McLaughlin.  3) What a tournament, just don’t mention the final. Here’s all 142 goals scored at Euro 2020, a shorter selection of the best strikes and here’s Uefa’s official review film. The best saves, too, including England’s Jordan Pickford and Gianluigi Donnarumma of Italy. How did Croydon Boxpark react to England smashing Ukraine in the quarters? Not as wildly as the Italians celebrated winning the whole thing. 4) It was Rachael Blackmore’s year in National Hunt racing, becoming the first woman to ride a Grand National winner on Minella Times. She also dominated the behind-closed-doors Cheltenham Festival when riding the winner in the Champion Hurdle on Honeysuckle as one of six winners across the week, making her leading jockey. She had to settle for second on A Plus Tard to Minella Indo, ridden by Jack Kennedy. Blackmore was by no means the only woman jockey enjoying success with Bryony Frost riding Greaneteen to two wins at Sandown. 5) This 247ft frisbee birdie was “unbelievable”, as the commentator says. Kevin Jones will see that 247ft effort, and raise to an incredible 530ft. Jordan Cox of Kent shows some serious skill and composure fielding on the boundary on Vitality Blast finals day. On the subject of which, Australia won their first ever T20 World Cup in beating New Zealand in Dubai. 6) It’s been one hell of a year for viral clips from our amazing world of sport stable, from a cricket bat being launched at a teammate, a Bolivian whirlwind mid-match, a surfing odyssey, classic sh!thousery, and some badminton frenzy. 7) Save the best until last?

12/23/2021,"The history books will show that Boris Johnson’s government was hit by two shattering humiliations in December 2021, two years after it was elected. The first was the record-setting revolt of 101 Conservative backbenchers against Covid passport regulations. The second, two days later, was the loss of the North Shropshire byelection to the Liberal Democrats. But, as we approach the start of 2022, the combined consequences of those reverses now matter more than the actual events themselves. That is because, between them, the two defeats have rewritten the script for the remainder of this government’s term.  We saw this in the lasting significance of what Johnson did on Monday. The prime minister emerged from an emergency cabinet meeting on the Omicron surge to announce – nothing. While other governments across Europe scrambled to save their health systems from being overwhelmed, Johnson’s decided it was undecided whether to do anything about it at all. If things changed, however, Johnson insisted: “We won’t hesitate to take that action.” Monday’s outcome negated that claim. The truth was the exact opposite. This was hesitation incarnate, a decision not to take action of the sort that the emergency cabinet meeting had presumably been called to approve in the first place. It was not the result of a considered consensus. The cabinet, it turns out, was split right down the middle, and still is. The result was that Britain now has a government unable to govern. This is the umbilical result of the fact that Johnson is now the hostage of his backbenchers and their cabinet allies, who are in turn emboldened by the voters’ damning verdict in Shropshire. So it is also important to see what happened this week as a harbinger of the Johnson government’s new – and potentially terminal – phase, in which it is no longer able to take necessary decisions and is abandoned by the electorate as a result. All failing governments eventually reach a similar point, after which it turns out to be downhill all the way. The question for British politics today is whether Johnson’s government has now reached that point. The evidence suggests it has done so, in its own distinctive way, and that consequently British voters are now open to something new. More than 40 years ago, during the 1979 election that brought Margaret Thatcher to power, the Labour prime minister, Jim Callaghan, made a famous observation about this kind of moment. “There are times,” Callaghan told his advisers, “perhaps once every 30 years, when there is a sea change in politics. It then does not matter what you say or what you do. There is a shift in what the public wants and what it approves of. I suspect there is now such a sea change – and it is for Mrs Thatcher.” Callaghan’s view can actually be disputed in some important respects. There was certainly a big sea change in political economy after 1979 that contrasted with the post-1945 world in which Callaghan rose to power. But the public never embraced Thatcherism to the wholehearted degree that Thatcher’s run of electoral success through the 1980s may have implied. Where he was right, however, is that the Labour governments of the 1970s had lost the public’s confidence in important ways, and that Thatcher was always likely to win in 1979. And he was right that, once a government reaches such a point, it has relatively little chance of clawing the old advantage back. There is no iron law about precisely how this works. Circumstances differ widely. Theresa May’s government began to fail near its start, when she threw away her majority in the 2017 election. David Cameron’s government, by contrast, became doomed only at the very end, when Cameron lost the Brexit vote. Had he won, Cameron might still be prime minister. With other governments, the crossing of the watershed is more gradual. Even John Major’s, which seems doomed in retrospect after Black Wednesday in 1992, might have survived if Labour had not focused so ruthlessly on ending its own run of four election defeats. And it wasn’t quite as obvious at the time as it seems now that Tony Blair’s authority was destroyed by Iraq; he went on to win another election, after all. Gordon Brown’s trajectory felt more predictable when, shortly after arriving in Downing Street, he flirted humiliatingly with calling an early election. In 2009, I was sitting next to the great lawyer Tom Bingham at a dinner when he turned and said: “I think the country decided two years ago that it will need a new government when the time comes.” On that, as on so much else, he was right. December 2021 feels like such a moment for Johnson. It is hard to recover from the reputation-shredding stories – with more to come – that produced North Shropshire. A prime minister being mocked by football and darts fans is not a good sign. Bad election results next year will undoubtedly trigger the leadership speculation that is never far below the surface in the party. Perhaps Bingham’s law applies today too, just as it did after 2007. The country feels as though it it is in the process of deciding that it will need a new government when the time comes. If that is right, then it may not matter too much who leads the Tory party next time. The crucial question will be whether the country has enough confidence in the Labour alternative.

12/23/2021,"The Morrison government has told a tribunal there is “strong public interest” in preserving the secrecy of “business case” documents that may outline the nucleus of the unlawful robodebt scheme. IT expert Justin Warren won access to documents connected to the since-scrapped welfare debt recovery program under freedom of information laws in 2019, but he is yet to receive them after the government appealed against the decision.  Warren’s lawyer argues there is “profound” public interest in release because they may shed light on what went wrong with the scheme, which eventually saw the government reach a $1.8bn settlement with about 400,000 victims in what the federal court called a “shameful chapter”. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which is considering the government’s latest attempt to keep the documents secret, heard closing arguments from both parties on Thursday. The tribunal has previously heard the documents include detailed costings and other financial data about the program, which matched yearly income data against a person’s fortnightly reports to Centrelink to send a person a debt. They are also said to include draft “new policy proposal” documents and purported attachments that outline a new plan to ramp up the government’s welfare debt recovery. The tribunal is considering, among other issues, whether the documents were prepared for the cabinet process or were simply being worked on internally by the then Department of Human Services, which administered the robodebt scheme. Counsel for the commonwealth, Andrew Berger QC, insisted on Thursday the documents should not be released because they were prepared for cabinet. “There is a very strong public interest in protecting from disclosure cabinet documents, whether they be at the dead centre of cabinet, such as cabinet notebooks, or further away from the epicentre of cabinet,” he told the tribunal. That extended to “preparatory documents”, such as some of the documents in question, he claimed. The tribunal has heard the documents never made it to cabinet itself, though one is a draft of a document that did, and the commonwealth argues information in other documents also appeared in newer material subsequently considered by cabinet. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In asserting the public interest in keeping the documents secret, Berger argued ministers would not receive full and frank information if there was concern any deliberations would be made public. He also told the tribunal Warren’s public interest arguments weren’t “actually borne out by the information in the documents”. Warren’s lawyer, Tom Brennan SC, said the commonwealth had failed to demonstrate why the documents should stay secret. Senior ministers between 2015 and 2016 included the former social services ministers, Scott Morrison and Christian Porter, who were members of cabinet, and the former human services ministers, Marise Payne and Alan Tudge, who were not. Brennan argued the Commonwealth had not proven that Morrison, as the cabinet minister at the time, had authorised the preparation of the material in question. “If it’s not before you then the case isn’t proven,” Brennan said. Because the commonwealth has appealed an earlier decision, it faces the onus of proof to show why the documents must be suppressed. Brennan said understanding of the “shameful” robodebt scheme would be “significantly enhanced by the disclosure of the documents in issue”. The public interest in release was “profound”, he said. The AAT hearing is one of several efforts the government has made to block the release of robodebt documents. The government services minister, Linda Reynolds, is facing a possible referral to the privileges committee for the government’s repeated refusal to hand over documents requested by the Senate. Labor has also promised a royal commission into the scheme if it wins the election. On Thursday, the Guardian revealed the government had reached a $2m settlement over a class action that claimed another welfare program – known colloquially as “remote work for the dole” – was unlawful on the bounds of racial discrimination. Warren’s case is being run pro bono by Maurice Blackburn and the Grata Fund’s FoI Project.
