5/3/2022,"A business owner is going viral after breaking down the “universal” salary she pays her employees. In early April, Madeline Pendleton (@madeline_pendleton) posted a TikTok that got plenty of viewers talking. In it, she broke down how — and why — she pays every one of her employees the same salary, including herself. Gas prices are likely to continue climbing through 2022: Here's how to save at the pump Pendleton is a 35-year-old influencer, podcaster and owner of Tunnel Vision, an L.A.-based clothing store. The shop, as her clip explains, has 10 full-time employees who all make $73,000 per year. Pendleton begins her clip by emphasizing that “any” company could follow her model “without having to spend more money.” “It’s just income redistribution,” she says. She goes on to show that in 2020, the average CEO at a top-350 U.S. firm made $24.2 million, which is over 351 times more than the average American worker. Pendleton’s suggestion is to eliminate that disparity completely by paying a “universal wage.” “You just take everybody’s salary in the whole place, and then you average them out among the number of workers you have,” she says. Pendleton’s business has $730,000 in total payroll costs per year, which she breaks down evenly between herself and her nine other full-time staff members. However, as she shows, she could be making over six times that much. As an experiment, Pendleton demonstrates what would happen if she paid her nine employees $16 per hour, which will soon be the minimum wage in Los Angeles. Those employees would make slightly over $33,000 a year, while she made over $430,000. This disparity, she points out, only gets wider at bigger companies. “It’s ridiculous,” she says. “This is what those CEOs are doing, so they can make that $24 million a year while you guys make like $30K or whatever.” The point goes beyond massive companies. As of 2022, the median salary of a CEO at any U.S. company was $790,418. That includes huge firms and small businesses like Pendleton’s. YouTube star Manny MUA shares his 7-step skincare routine: Many commenters praised Pendleton’s policy. “This is EXACTLY how you do it!” one user wrote. “As a manager, I’m for it. Guarantee you my CEO’s not though,” another added. “So much love for you!” another wrote. Others questioned the policy’s limitations. Some wondered how an evenly split income could work in other fields, where experience or education differs more vastly. “So at the hospital, the doctors should make the same as the janitor?” one user asked. “Not everybody deserves the same pay. You get paid what you bring to the table,” another agreed. Still, some were just glad to see a business owner being transparent about her finances. In that sense, Pendleton’s video follows a larger trend on TikTok, where users have been sharing their salaries and earnings across many fields. TikTokers have recently revealed how much they make working at Hooters, at Waffle House and even as NFL water boys.

5/3/2022,"Authorities on Monday issued an arrest warrant for a missing corrections officer who disappeared with an inmate from a northern Alabama jail last week. Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said police know Vicky White, who disappeared with inmate Casey Cole White Friday morning from the Lauderdale County Detention Center in Florence, Ala, ""participated"" in the escape, though it's still unclear whether she did so willingly or was coerced. The charges against the officer include permitting or facilitating escape of the inmate, Singleton said at a news conference Monday. Singleton also said Casey White was handcuffed and shackled when he and the officer left the jail Friday. He described Vicky White as a ""exemplary employee,"" who had planned to retire leading up to her disappearance. The U.S. Marshals Service was offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the capture of inmate Casey Cole White and the location of the ""missing and endangered"" corrections officer. The pair planned to travel to a local courthouse when they disappeared. Police say the two are not related. Casey White, 38, was being held on two capital murder charges in 2020 when he also confessed to killing Connie Ridgeway, 58. The mother was stabbed in her home in 2015. The pair wasn't discovered missing until 3:30 p.m. Friday afternoon, six hours after they left the jail. Vicky White's vehicle was found in the parking lot of a nearby shopping center. Here's what we know. Vicky White was armed when she left the jail with Casey White for a mental health evaluation for Casey at a courthouse Friday morning, Sheriff Rick Singleton said at a press conference Friday. But no mental health evaluation was scheduled at the courthouse for Casey White that day, Singleton said, also noting the officer was alone with the inmate — a violation of department policy. Deputies had attempted to contact the officer once they realized she and the inmate were missing, but her phone repeatedly went to voicemail. It is not clear whether the incident was an attempted escape, or if Vicky White was possibly overpowered and kidnapped, according to Singleton. He said investigators are trying determine whether there were any previous significant interactions between the pair. Casey White was sentenced in 2019 to 75 years in prison after being convicted of two counts of first-degree kidnapping and attempted murder, according to a report from The News Courier in Athens, Alabama. He's a 6-foot, 9-inch tall white male and weighs about 260 pounds, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. He has brown hair, hazel eyes and has tattoos on his back and left shoulder blade. He is believed to be a ""serious threat to the corrections officer and the public,"" according to Marty Keely, the U.S. marshal for northern Alabama. Authorities advised residents not to approach him if he is spotted. Vicky White worked as assistant director of corrections at the Lauderdale County Sheriff’s Office and has been with the department for 16 years. She turned in her retirement papers the day before she went missing. The Marshals Service said people with information about Casey White’s location or Vicky White’s disappearance can call 1-800-336-0102.
