12/10/2021,"A Chicago jury Thursday reached guilty verdicts on five of six charges against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, who was accused of falsely reporting he was the victim of a disturbing, hate-fueled beating. The panel, deliberating since Wednesday afternoon, weighed six counts of felony disorderly conduct against Smollett for telling police he was brutally assaulted on Jan. 29, 2019, at 2:45 a.m. in the Windy City's Streeterville neighborhood. The offenses are class 4 felonies and could be punishable by up to three years behind bars. But Smollett has a clean criminal record, making any jail time highly unlikely. Smollett said he was attacked by two men, who punched him, kicked him, used racist and homophobic slurs, threw chemicals into his face, wrapped rope around his neck and even yelled out a slogan in support of then-President Donald Trump. That initial report brought huge support for the actor, who is Black and gay. Even President Trump expressed sympathy for Smollett and decried the alleged attack, saying “That I can tell you is horrible. It doesn’t get worse."" But the Chicago police investigation took a radical turn two weeks later when officers detained two Nigerian brothers at O’Hare International Airport in connection to the reported beating. They were released and then on Feb. 21, 2019, Smollett was arrested as CPD Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the actor's story was a hoax aimed at advancing the defendant's career. Abimbola and Olabingo Osundairo, the brothers who were originally picked up by police, said they were recruited by Smollett to stage the attack. Smollett, who played gay singer-songwriter Jamal Lyon on ""Empire,"" was written off the popular Fox musical drama. Charges against Smollett were dropped in March, 2019, but the actor insisted he wasn't lying and his team lashed out at police for accusing him of pulling a hoax. The matter proved to be far from settled as the city of Chicago filed a lawsuit against the actor for money spent in the investigation. The criminal case was renewed after a special prosecutor was appointed and a fresh set of indictments were handed up again against Smollett for allegedly concocting the hoax.

12/10/2021,"Anna Duggar was spotted looking emotionless on her way out of the Arkansas federal courthouse where her husband, Josh Duggar, was convicted of child pornography possession on Thursday. Anna, 33, exited the John Paul Hammerschmidt Federal Building dressed in a black dress and matching peacoat, with a protective face mask on. A jury found, Josh, 33, guilty on one count each of receiving and possessing child pornography. He faces up to 20 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000 for each count when he’s sentenced. U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks said sentencing will happen in about four months, Fayetteville TV station KNWA reported. JOSH DUGGAR TRIAL VERDICT FINDS HIM GUILTY ON CHILD PORNOGRAPHY CHARGES The former ""19 Kids and Counting"" star was immediately taken into custody after the federal jury read aloud his verdict. Duggar's attorneys released a statement to Fox News shortly after the verdict, saying they intend to appeal. ""We appreciate the jury’s lengthy deliberations, we respect the jury’s verdict, and we intend to appeal,"" defense attorneys Justin Gelfand, Ian Murphy, and Travis Story said. US Attorneys in the case held a press conference outside the courthouse after the verdict was announced. ""This case represents a significant milestone for the Western District of Arkansas and our continued efforts to combat child abuse. Those who would say that children who were photographed and videoed in a manner similar to the evidence in this case are not abused and are not victims are clearly wrong. Children who are photographed and videoed in manners such as this are the victims and every time their videos and photos are traded online, uploaded, and downloaded from the internet, they are victimized again,"" one of the U.S. attorneys said. JOSH DUGGAR TRIAL: FRIEND CLAIMS DUGGAR CONFESSED TO MOLESTING CHILDREN Duggar and his large Arkansas family starred on TLC’s ""19 Kids and Counting"" until the network canceled the show in 2015 following revelations that he had molested four of his sisters and a babysitter. Authorities began investigating the abuse in 2006 after receiving a tip from a family friend but concluded that the statute of limitations on any possible charges had expired. Duggar’s parents said he had confessed to the fondling and apologized. At the time, Duggar apologized publicly for unspecified behavior and resigned as a lobbyist for the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group. Duggar later apologized for a pornography addiction and for cheating on his wife, calling himself ""the biggest hypocrite ever."" Duggar's family friend Bobye Holt took the stand and claimed the star confessed to molesting multiple young girls during a conversation back in 2003. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER Federal authorities said they began investigating after a Little Rock police detective found child porn files were being shared by a computer traced to Duggar. A federal agent testified in May that images depicting the sexual abuse of children, including toddlers, were downloaded in 2019 onto a computer at a car dealership Duggar owned. The defense had argued that someone else downloaded or placed the child pornography onto the computer at Duggar’s workplace, noting that no child pornography was found on Duggar’s phone or laptop. But the jury wasn’t swayed. Anna remained by her husband's side each day as they walked in and out of court, holding hands. The couple welcomed their seventh child together in October.

12/10/2021,"A dad and his son were fishing in Missouri when they discovered a rare elk antler, wildlife officials say. The Missouri Department of Conservation says the “unique” elk antler was attached to the animal’s skull plate, as seen in a photo shared on Facebook. This means the elk did not shed the antler, as male bulls do each year. Sam Clarkson and his dad, Ben, were fishing at Sowards Ford Access on the Grand River on Dec. 3 when they found the antler in the riverbed, officials say. They then alerted a conservation agent. “It looks to be old, like it had been in the water for quite some time,” said Harrison County Agent Cpl. Josh Roller. Officials say that it may have come from an elk that wandered into northwest Missouri, or it may be “very old” if it was protected under mud. Its origin is unknown. Roller “issued a Wildlife Disposition for the pair to legally keep the antler.” In Missouri, “any person who finds and takes into possession a dead elk with antlers still attached to the skull plate must report it to a conservation agent within twenty-four (24) hours to receive possession authorization.” This is not the case for antlers that were shed before they were found. “Congratulations to Sam and Ben on this rare find,” officials said. Many people who came across the Facebook post were impressed with the Clarksons’ nature discovery. “That would be so cool to find,” one person replied. “Very cool,” said another. “I’ve done a lot of walking along creeks and rivers and found a few interesting things but nothing like that. That’s something he will always remember.” “Absolutely incredible especially the location,” replied another. In Missouri, conservation officials say you are most likely to find elk in parts of Carter, Reynolds and Shannon counties. Those are all in the southeast portion of the state, but the antler was found in northwestern Worth County. While elk are not common in Missouri, they are believed to have once roamed the state. “Before the coming of Europeans, elk, or wapiti, probably ranged over the entire region of what is now Missouri,” the Department of Conservation says. “By 1830, elk were becoming scarce; they eventually were limited to just the northwestern and southeastern parts of the state. By the 1880s, they were extirpated. “Today, elk have been reintroduced, in large part, because of their popularity for hunting and ecotourism.” Bear hunter discovers elk killed by archer — a historic first, Missouri officials say Missouri hunter shoots 16-point ‘buck’ — then discovers it’s something much more rare Hunter had never seen a bear in Missouri.

12/10/2021,"An artificial intelligence and software company is making camper attachments for Tesla Cybertrucks. Stream It has already had $100 million in preorders for its CyberLandr, the company announced Wednesday. See inside the $50,000 CyberLandr, which will be produced and delivered in tandem with the Cybertruck. Chatter about Tesla's upcoming Cybertruck has subsided since its unveiling in late 2019, but that's not stopping designers from imagining its potential uses. Source: Insider This includes Lance King, the CEO of Stream It, a software and artificial intelligence company that's now pivoting to create attachments that can turn Cybertrucks into a pop-up tiny home on wheels. Yes, you read that right. A tech company is now making pickup-truck campers, or ""CyberLandrs."" The production of Tesla's infamous Cybertruck might have been pushed back from 2021 to 2022, but that's not stopping Stream It from ""ramping everything up,"" King told Insider. King first thought of the idea when he was preordering a Cybertruck and realized no existing RV or camper would be compatible with the futuristic truck's body. The RV industry ""hasn't innovated in 50 years,"" King said. ""They're not going to get a stroke of genius and create a new RV. And I thought, 'Who could do it?'"" King says the answer is his Stream It team. ""The only company I can think of that could do that is my company,"" King said. ""We've got the software developers; we've got the AI; and we're really creative. We wanted it to be a Tesla-like experience even when you were in a RV."" According to King, a ""true Tesla level RV"" needs strong software that's capable of artificial intelligence and yearly updates, similar to Tesla's vehicles. So toward the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the face of potential layoffs, King decided to put his team to work designing the CyberLandr. Before this project, the company had never worked in the RV industry, though many team members enjoy overlanding, camping, and RVing. King says this inexperience with RVs is actually a ""massive strength."" ""Tesla would never have been able to reinvent the car had they been in the car business,"" King said. ""Just being in that changes your field of vision. We think it was necessary to not be in the RV industry to create a truly new and unique product."" So far, the investment is paying off. The camper was an instant success upon its unveiling in early April, according to the company. To prove potential market success, the company's goal was to have 100 to 200 interested customers within the first month. Instead, it saw 1,000 buyers, it said. According to King, the CyberLandr team has already hit more than $100 million in preorders, the company announced Wednesday and confirmed to Insider. Source: GlobeNewswire It's even received a one-word stamp of approval from Elon Musk, who called a video of the CyberLandr ""cool"" in early July. Source: Twitter The camper's popularity should come as no surprise. The CyberLandr combines two growing trends that have recently flooded the automobile industry: camper vans and electric pickup trucks. Now let's take a closer look at the tiny home on wheels. The roughly $50,000 CyberLandr has a retractable staircase that leads up to the interior's living room, bedroom, and bathroom. Source: CyberLandr The entire unit can tuck away into the Cybetruck's bed when it's not in use. Think of it as a pop-top camper. Let's start in the kitchen, which has all the basic necessities with a tech-forward twist, like a voice-controlled smart faucet, a refrigerator, a porcelain countertop with a hidden cooktop, and a sink with a cutting board and drying rack. The living room is right next to the kitchen and comes with removable seats, voice- or phone-activated lights and temperature control, and a 32-inch smart television equipped with streaming services like Netflix and Apple TV+. This space can also be used as an office: The television can double as a second monitor; the pivoting tables can be used as desks; and the CyberLandr's Starlink satellite dish can provide an internet connection. The living room also transforms into a bedroom. All you have to do is unfold the seats into a roughly queen-sized bed. There's also space under the bed to sleep an additional adult or two children. Other amenities inside the tiny home on wheels include heated floors, an onboard bathroom with a shower, sink, and toilet, and smart glass that can dim for more privacy. Source: YouTube To power all of this, the CyberLandr will use the truck's battery and its own 500-watt solar panels. Stream It predicts the 1,200-pound camper will inevitably cut the truck's range by 5%. When it's fully deployed, the truck and its tiny home will likely stand at just under 11 feet tall, depending on the final height of the Cybertruck. Designing a camper based on a vehicle that doesn't exist yet has its obvious challenges, but King believes the Cybertruck's design won't change too much from the original unveil. And the team has already created renderings of the camper with exact measurements, allowing the designers to easily change the camper's dimensions according to the final Cybertruck design. The campers will eventually be produced near the Cybertruck's manufacturing site in Texas. This proximity will allow the CyberLandr team to install the campers onto the Cybertrucks for its customers. Source: CNBC In the short term, the company will be leasing a manufacturing facility just outside of Austin, Texas. But looking ahead, Stream It plans to create its own facility in the city. Despite this prep work, King is ""really nervous"" about the first customers who ordered a CyberLandr. The product is wholly dependent on the final Cybertruck specifications, so if Tesla doesn't share them before the Cybertrucks are shipped out, the team will have to take their own measurements and tweak the designs. This means the first few customers might not have their CyberLandrs by the time their Cybertrucks are ready. ""We're ramping up everything to make sure we can respond very quickly to those changes and get them out as soon as possible afterwards,"" King said.

12/10/2021,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Along with speeding tickets, truck drivers in California could soon have to worry about pollution tickets while traveling the state's roads. State regulators on Thursday will consider cracking down on heavy duty trucks weighing more than 14,000 pounds (6,350 kilograms) — those big semi-trailers that make up just 3% of all vehicles in California but spend so much time on the road they account for more than half of all pollution from cars and trucks each year. The rules would require these big trucks — including ones from other states passing through California — to be tested at least twice per year to make sure they meet the state's standards for particulate matter and ozone pollution. Passenger cars are already required to get smog checks. Newer trucks have sensors on board that can monitor emissions and send data to the state. But regulators also plan to use roadside monitoring devices to catch trucks that pollute too much, along with automated license plate readers to identify the offenders. The state has two of these unattended monitoring devices in place and plans to install more. The devices resemble toll booths and capture a sample of the truck's exhaust as it passes through without stopping. Environmental advocates say the rule would be the most significant action in a dozen years to clean up California's air, which consistently ranks among the dirtiest in the country. If enacted, state officials estimate the rules would prevent more than 7,000 premature deaths because of respiratory illnesses by 2050, avoiding more than $75 billion in health care costs. “(The rules) have some significance for climate, but what we’re really talking about here is the smog and the particulate matter that is making people sick and killing people,” said Bill Magavern, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air, a statewide advocacy group. The proposal is one of a flurry of forthcoming changes that could dramatically reshape consumer and industry behavior in the nation's most populous state that, were it an independent country, would have the world's fifth-largest economy. Also on Thursday, the California Air Resources Board will consider banning the sale of new products run by small gas-powered engines, including leaf blowers, lawn mowers and portable generators — a rule recently mandated by the state's Democratic-dominated state Legislature. Next year, regulators are poised to tighten emission standards for barges, ferries, fishing boats and tugboats that line California's coastal cities. And, further down the road, regulators plan to ban the sale of all new gas-powered cars by 2035. “These are the decisions we have to make if we're serious about reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and leaving future generations with healthier communities,” said Assemblyman Marc Berman, a Democrat from Palo Alto who authored the law requiring the ban on new gas-powered lawn equipment. While the new smog check rules for big trucks will have the largest impact on air quality — preventing more than 680,000 tons of smog by 2050 — banning the sale of new gas-powered lawn equipment will be the rule consumers notice the most. Car engines have advanced over the years to pollute less. But the small engines that power most lawn equipment haven't made as much progress. State regulators say the amount of pollution that comes from running a gas-powered leaf blower for one hour is comparable to driving a gas-powered car about 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers) — or roughly the distance between Los Angeles and Denver. “Nobody will have to give up or stop using equipment they already own. The force of this regulation falls on manufacturers,"" Berman said. The rules would have the biggest impact on professional landscapers, who rely on gas-powered equipment to do multiple jobs per day. California lawmakers included $30 million in the most recent state budget to assist these companies converting to battery-powered equipment. But on Thursday, some landscapers testified that equipment would not be as reliable. Trucking companies and small engine manufacturers have mostly complained about how fast these new standards would imposed. Both the smog check rules for trucks and the ban on the sale of new gas-powered lawn equipment would be fully implemented by 2024, while a similar ban sales of new gas-powered generators would take effect in 2028. Chris Shimoda, senior vice president for government affairs with the California Trucking Association, said the industry is suffering from a shortage of drivers and parts because of global supply chain disruptions. He said one sensor that measures diesel exhaust fluid that normally costs around $300 now can cost $7,000 or more. “We just want to make sure that, again, anybody experiencing those sort of issues is not left high and dry,” Shimoda said. Jeff Coad, vice president for marketing and product management for the small engine manufacturer Briggs & Stratton, said the company is ambivalent about how their products are powered but said it won't have enough time to fully comply. “Converting a product such as a large zero turn mower from gas to lithium battery power is not just a matter of replacing the engine with the battery,” he said, adding the development time can take up to two years. Liane Randolph, chair of the California Air Resources Board, said the state is sensitive to those concerns, adding that regulators do a careful analysis of both the costs and the health benefits of any proposed rule. “These regulations result in less trips to the emergency room, less long term health impacts, and, frankly, less medical costs for the community,” she said.",U.S./Associated Press,"California eyes tough standards for trucks, lawn equipment",https://news.yahoo.com/california-eyes-tough-standards-trucks-210010104.html
12/10/2021,"McALESTER, Okla. (AP) — Oklahoma executed a man Thursday for the 1985 shooting death of an Oklahoma City-area schoolteacher after courts rejected his claim that the state’s lethal injection method would result in unconstitutional pain and suffering. Bigler Stouffer II, 79, received a three-drug lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. Stouffer was the first person executed in Oklahoma since John Grant convulsed on the gurney and vomited during his lethal injection in October as the state ended a six-year execution moratorium brought on by concerns over its protocols. Thursday's execution process that began at 10 a.m. appeared to go more smoothly. After receiving lethal drugs, Stouffer was declared unconscious at 10:07 a.m., and his breaths became shallower at 10:09 a.m. He was declared dead at 10:16 a.m. Oklahoma Attorney General John O’Connor said in statement that the execution “was carried out with zero complications.” The Rev. Howard Potts, who was in the death chamber with Stouffer, said Stouffer ""was totally at peace.” Stouffer's last words were: “My request is that my father forgive them. Thank you.” Stouffer has maintained his innocence in the attack that left Linda Reaves dead and her boyfriend, Doug Ivens, seriously injured. He and his attorneys argued in court filings that the state’s three-drug execution method poses a risk of unconstitutional pain and suffering and that Stouffer should be included among other death row plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging the protocols. But his request for a stay of execution was denied by a federal district judge and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. A final appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court was denied Thursday morning, less than two hours before the scheduled execution Stouffer was convicted and sentenced to death in 2003 after his first conviction and death sentence were overturned. At a parole board hearing last month, he said Ivens was shot as the two men fought over a gun at Ivens' home, and that Reaves was dead when he arrived. “I am totally innocent of the murder of Linda Reaves and my heart goes out to the family of Linda Reaves that have suffered as a result of her murder,"" Stouffer told the board during a video appearance from prison. Prosecutors said Stouffer went to the home to borrow the gun from Ivens, then fatally shot Reaves and wounded Ivens to gain access to Ivens’ $2 million life insurance policy. At the time, Stouffer was dating Ivens’ ex-wife. Despite being shot three times with a .38-caliber pistol, including once in the face, Ivens survived and testified against Stouffer. Ivens has since died. “Stouffer's heinous actions against Doug and Linda, his lies and manipulations in the years to follow, and his complete lack of sorrow and remorse for the hurt he caused should dictate one conclusion — the jury's death sentence must be carried out,"" attorneys for the state wrote in asking the Pardon and Parole Board to reject Stouffer's request for clemency. Several members of the board voiced concerns about the state's ability to humanely execute people. But Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt ultimately rejected the board’s recommendation that Stitt commute Stouffer’s sentence to life in prison without parole. Reaves' cousin, Rodney Thomson, spoke to reporters after Stouffer's execution, saying the killing had consumed his family members. He thanked the attorney general and staff and other prosecutors and investigators who worked on the case. “Today we witnessed the law of the land carried out on behalf of my cousin,” Thomson read from a statement. “Although long in coming, justice has prevailed.” Stitt did grant clemency to another man on death row, Julius Jones, last month just hours before his scheduled execution, commuting his sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole. That case had drawn outcry and protests over doubts about his guilt in the slaying of a businessman more than 20 years ago. Executions in Oklahoma have typically been held in the evenings, but prison officials moved Stouffer's execution to 10 a.m. to make it easier for the prison to return to normal operations, said Department of Corrections spokesman Josh Ward. Oklahoma had one of the nation’s busiest death chambers until problems in 2014 and 2015 led to a de facto moratorium. Richard Glossip was  just hours away from being executed in September 2015 when prison officials realized they received the wrong lethal drug. It was later learned the same wrong drug had been used to execute another man in January 2015. The drug mix-ups followed a botched execution in April 2014 in which inmate Clayton Lockett struggled on a gurney before dying 43 minutes into his lethal injection — and after the state’s prisons chief ordered executioners to stop.",U.S./Associated Press,Oklahoma executes man for 1985 slaying of schoolteacher,https://news.yahoo.com/oklahoma-prepares-execute-man-1985-050314469.html
