4/30/2022,"Donald Trump has been mocked for fearing protesters would throw “dangerous” fruit at him, with late-night talkshow host Trevor Noah calling it “one of the most crazy defenses I’ve ever heard”. The revelation came during the former president’s testimony to attorneys representing a group of protesters suing over their violent removal from a Trump campaign rally in 2015. According to the transcript of the deposition, when asked about his statement to the crowd that “If you see someone getting ready to throw a tomato, just knock the crap out of them, would you,” Trump replied: “It’s very dangerous stuff. You can get killed with those things. “We were threatened,” the president added. “They were going to throw fruit. We were threatened. We had a threat. Trump also said: “I wanted to have people be ready because we were put on alert that they were going to do fruit.” “What do you mean ‘do fruit’?” said Late Night host Seth Meyers on Thursday’s episode. “What do you mean you were put on alert? There’s an alert system for fruit? It’s like the homeland security threat level? Red’s tomato, yellow is for banana and green is for avocado. “You know what they say,” Meyers added, “if you get hit with an avocado, you’re toast.” Trump claimed in the deposition that he became aware of the threat of being beaned by a tomato because the Secret Service warned him: “We were told. I thought Secret Service was involved in that, actually. And you get hit with fruit, it’s very violent stuff. Tomato, when they start doing that stuff, it’s very dangerous. There was an alert out that day.” Perhaps aware of the potentially serious consequences of admitting he had intended security staff or other rally attendees to commit violence, Trump insisted his “knock the crap out them, would you” comment was a joke. “It was said sort of in jest. But maybe, you know, a little truth to it. I wanted to have people be ready because we were put on alert that they were going to do fruit. And some fruit is a lot worse than … tomatoes are bad by the way. But it’s very dangerous … they were going to hit very hard.” The videotaped deposition took place in New York’s Bronx county in October 2021. Noah, on his show, simply read the transcript aloud, because “no comedy writer is going to come up with something funnier than Trump’s deposition”.",News/US news,Trump mocked for fearing protesters would throw ‘dangerous’ fruit at him,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/29/trump-dangerous-fruit-tomato-jokes
4/30/2022,"After days of more talk following her all around the grounds of Madrid, this time about the merits of her unusual perspective to coaching in light of her decision to part ways with her coach Torben Beltz after five months, Emma Raducanu’s clay-court education resumed with an excellent win on her Madrid Open debut. Having trailed 2-5 in the opening set while twice standing one point away from relinquishing it, Raducanu showcased her adaptability and mental fortitude as she methodically turned the match on its head to defeat Tereza Martincova 7-6, 6-0 and reach the second round. The match-up was a second meeting between the pair this month, with Raducanu already demonstrating her ability to play the big points best as she ground through a 7-5, 7-5 win against Martincova in her first professional match on clay at the Billie Jean King Cup. But while the altitude of Madrid that makes the ball fly and the conditions faster is a better fit for Raducanu, as were they for Martincova who has played best on faster surfaces. The Czech served extremely well and imposed consistent pressure on Raducanu with her forehand and played an extremely clean opening set. As in Prague however, Raducanu produced her best tennis in the tightest moments and she completely changed her approach. Not only did she begin to load up her shots with more topspin, adding margin into her game, moving further behind and eliciting errors from an increasingly refusing to miss, she also truly embraced the surface beneath her with her method of attack. Having started the match attacking as if on a hard court, Raducanu began to drag Martincova off the court with width. In the attritional rallies that followed, Raducanu continually outmaneuvered Martincova, her greater athleticism so often the difference after so many strokes. Across the net, all opposition soon crumbled. After saving the set points, levelling the opening set at 5-5 and then harnessing her momentum into an excellent tiebreak, Raducanu ran with the match, winning 10 of the last 11 games to seal another victory. Such a thoughtful performance further underlined why Raducanu is so confident in her ability to read and understand the game, and why she does not think she needs a prominent coach to guide her at all times. It also showed how she may be able to adapt to the clay with more experience in the future. She will next face Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine, a fellow 19 year-old she grew up playing against as a junior. In the men’s Madrid Open draw, which begins on Sunday, Andy Murray has been dealt a fascinating first round draw against former US Open champion Dominic Thiem. While Thiem and Murray once faced each other as top 10 players, both are a long way from those heights now. Murray is a surprise wildcard entrant in Madrid after reversing his decision to skip the entire clay court season in order to preserve his body for the grass court season. Thiem, meanwhile, continues his comeback after a disastrous year stemming from a serious wrist injury then numerous setbacks. He is yet to win a match in his three tournaments back. Almost a year on from her well-publicised withdrawal from the French Open, Naomi Osaka returned to European clay courts with a promising victory as she recovered from a break down to comfortably defeat Anastasia Potapova 6-3, 6-1.",Sport/Sport,Emma Raducanu enjoys straight-sets win over Tereza Martincova,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/29/emma-raducanu-enjoys-straight-sets-win-over-tereza-martincova
4/30/2022,"At the end of a live GB News interview just three days ago about a report on rural poverty, Neil Parish was asked in passing for his views on claims that a Tory MP had been caught watching pornography. “If you have got 650 members of parliament in what is a very intense area you are going to get people that step over the line,” the Conservative MP told GB News, pokerfaced. “I don’t think there is necessarily a huge culture [of that behaviour] here but it does have to be dealt with and dealt with seriously and I think that is what the whips will do in our whips’ office.” After a 12-year parliamentary career in which the MP for Tiverton and Honiton had rarely – if ever – been elevated to national importance, he now finds himself at the centre of a political storm after it emerged on Friday that the Tory whip had been removed from him over the allegations. A farmer and former member of the European parliament for South West England, and a councillor before that, Parish was part of the 2010 parliamentary intake when he won what has increasingly become a safe Tory seat. Since then, he has avoided controversy and has tended to measure his words relatively carefully in media appearances and has served since 2015 as chair of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee (Efra). One of the few areas where he has gone against the grain of his own party has been in his opposition to rewilding, which he opposes despite it being a position endorsed by Boris Johnson himself and most of the party. One Tory source with previous experience working with him on the Efra committee – to which Parish was returned as chair in successive terms – described him as quiet and hard working. “He would not have been on the top of my list of suspects,” they said, adding that Parish, 65, is “rather boring, actually”. Parish had been a farmer in his native Somerset and still lives on the family farm, according to a profile on his website, which says he is married and has two children and two grandchildren. The MP employs his wife as a junior secretary, according to his register of interests, which also declares interests from the family farm in Somerset. The MP’s website also lists “the politics of Africa” as being among his other interests, adding that a ban on him re-entering Zimbabwe after he criticised Robert Mugabe’s regime in his capacity as an election monitor remained in place to this day. The MP had said this week that he also wore “as a badge of honour” the fact that he was among more than 280 MPs who had been “sanctioned” by Russia. Records of Parish’s parliamentary voting record, meanwhile, show that he has tended to go – in the vast majority of cases – in the same direction as Tory colleagues, though he was among those who had advocated during the 2016 referendum for the UK to remain in the EU. In the past, Parish had gained some fans among animal welfare campaigners when he tried to stop the government signing post-Brexit trade deals that would have devalued animal welfare. Nevertheless, nature campaigners have reacted to the latest news by saying they hoped that he would be replaced on the committee by someone who was more in favour of nature restoration than Parish, who usually takes the side of landowners and farmers in rewilding debates.",News/Politics,Neil Parish: Tory MP at centre of Commons pornography scandal,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/29/neil-parish-tory-mp-scandal-profile
4/30/2022,"Danny Cipriani has revealed his career in England will be over at the end of the season when he will leave Bath. The 34-year-old has announced he intends to move abroad after his only season at the Rec but could yet extend his playing career in the United States, France or Japan. Cipriani has struggled to make an impact on the pitch for Bath this season, making only eight starts having joined from Gloucester after an extended break from the game. His impact off the field, however, was recently lauded by the Bath director of rugby Stuart Hooper, who tipped the fly-half to make the transition into coaching. “My last couple games in England are fast arriving!!! I’ve decided to move on to experience a new country and make great memories with my family,” Cipriani wrote on Instagram. “Over the years I’ve accrued some amazing loyal supporters. I’m grateful. From the bottom of my heart. Thank you.” Should Cipriani opt to continue playing he will not be short of suitors and a move to the US – following in the footsteps of Chris Robshaw and Ben Foden – would seem an obvious fit considering he has spent time in Malibu for warm-weather training. Regardless, after Saturday’s west country derby against Gloucester he has just two more matches in which to appear before the curtain comes down on his career in England. Cipriani will leave, having enjoyed two spells at Wasps and one at Sale as well as his time at Gloucester and Bath but with a sense of promise unfulfilled on the international stage.

4/30/2022,"Britain is poised to impose a form of direct rule over the British Virgin Islands after the Caribbean territory’s premier was arrested in Miami on suspicion for drug running, and a UK-appointed commission of inquiry found rampant failings in governance. Andrew Fahie was due to appear in court in Miami on Friday, a day after he was arrested by the US Drug Enforcement Agency in an elaborate sting operation that also snared the chief executive of the BVI port authority and her son. Hours before his court appearance, the commission of inquiry – launched in 2021 – reported on widespread abuses, including millions of dollars of government funds that were spent each year by politicians and ministries without proper process. In its highly critical final report, the commission led by Judge Sir Gary Hickinbottom recommended that the territory should have its constitution suspended, its elected government dissolved and effectively be ruled from London. Foreign secretary Liz Truss did not immediately impose direct rule, but said the report showed “clearly that substantial legislative and constitutional change is required to restore the standards of governance that the people of the BVI are entitled to.” The UK is already responsible for defence and foreign policy in the BVI, which is a British overseas territory, but governor general John Rankin – Queen Elizabeth’s representative on the island – is now expected to take charge of all BVI domestic policy and budgets. The report is not directly linked to Fahie’s dramatic arrest, but the British government had been clearly aware of the US Drug Enforcement Agency investigation into drug running. After the DEA sting operation on Thursday, British ministers decided to rush out publication of the Hickinbottom report, short-circuiting a planned consultation procedure with island politicians. The UK last imposed direct rule on an overseas territory when it took charge of the Turks and Caicos Islands in 2009, and the British government is clearly nervous over how its plans will be greeted on the islands. The UK Minister for the Overseas Territories Amanda Milling is now to fly to the BVI for discussions with local officials. Allegations of rampant criminality on the BVI had prompted starkly contrasting approaches from US and UK authorities, with the UK adopting a public commission of inquiry dominated by lawyers and the US launching an elaborate undercover police operation which eventually led to the territory’s most senior elected official. The BVI commission of inquiry was launched in 2021 amid allegations of corruption and drug running at the highest level on the islands. Those claims were not investigated by the commission, but its 1,000-page report concluded that maladministration was so endemic that it would be impossible to prevent corruption and conflicts of interest in the awarding of contracts, appointments to public office and the administration of money. The UK has come under increasing pressure to crack down on drug trafficking through the territory, which has become a major conduit for narcotics into the US. Fahie was arrested on a private jet in Miami, where he was being shown what he thought was a $700,000 payment in return for allowing BVI ports to be used as a “resting place” for cocaine from Mexico before it was shipped to Puerto Rico and Miami. US agencies had wiretapped an informant acting as drug runner and in a succession of meetings negotiated a deal that Fahie calculated would bring him more than $7m. In his report, Hickinbottom insisted the suspension of the powers of elected ministers “was not only warranted but essential if the abuses which I have identified are to be tackled and brought to an end”. He said that successive BVI governments had “deliberately sought to avoid good governance by not putting processes in place and where such processes are in place by passing them or ignoring them as and when they wish – which is regrettably often.” Hickinbottom said he had no desire to frustrate the islands’ aspirations to self-determination as a modern democracy, and recommended a year-long constitutional review to end the opportunities for the abuse and dishonesty in public office. He urged the governor general to set up an advisory body of local people with whom he should consult about how to rule the island. Hickinbottom said he had made his recommendations, including the dissolution of the assembly, “with a heavy heart”. “[But] unless the most urgent and drastic steps are taken, the current situation with the elected government deliberately ignoring the tenets of good governance will go on indefinitely,” he said.

4/30/2022,"Even as Conservative whips claimed they were hunting down the MP who made anonymous derogatory comments about Angela Rayner this week, one senior Tory minister was already making light of it. Following the claim that Labour’s deputy leader had been using a “Basic Instinct” ploy to distract Boris Johnson, a male minister was seen making a series of jokes about women crossing and uncrossing their legs suggestively while in one of parliament’s bars. The remarks, witnessed by someone working in Westminster, are the latest sign of a macho culture that it is struggling to shake off. Five years on from another scandal at the heart of government, which resulted in the sacking of the effective deputy prime minister, Damian Green, the slur against Rayner led to female politicians raising the alarm over ongoing alleged misogyny and sexual misconduct, including a Conservative MP allegedly caught watching pornography on his phone in the Commons. Female politicians say sexist and demeaning treatment on the parliamentary estate continues unchecked. “Everybody has experience of sexism, it’s just rife,” said Alex Davies-Jones, Labour MP and shadow minister. “You know, comments about appearance, and comments on what we’re wearing rather than what we’re saying.” Three cabinet ministers are said to be among more than 50 MPs facing complaints of sexual misconduct made to the parliamentary watchdog. Many of the most blatant examples relate to after-hours drinking in Westminster’s bars. Lynne Featherstone, who served as equalities minister in the coalition government and now sits in the Lords, recalled an incident on the Commons terrace when she was still an MP. A Labour MP in his sixties “kept saying to his researchers, ‘come and sit on my knee’ and different ones were taking a turn sitting on his knee and giggling and stuff”, she said. “It was just horrible to watch. He was pulling them onto his knee and they were giggling because they were young and impressionable.” The Labour MP Jess Phillips recalled seeing similar behaviour from Conservative MPs. “I’ve watched older Tory men having young women sitting on their laps on the terrace on a late night,” she said. In the chamber itself, sexism comes most often in the form of patronising or derogatory comments. It is more than a decade since David Cameron told Labour’s Angela Eagle to “calm down dear” during a Commons exchange, but women in parliament say belittling treatment is still routine. Phillips, who describes herself as “quite rowdy in the chamber”, says she is frequently shushed by Tories on the opposite benches. “You get men, and it is always men, on the opposite benches who treat you like a harridan for behaving just exactly as they behave. I’ve had people putting their fingers to their lips and doing the calm down sign with their hands. “They wouldn’t necessarily perceive that they were being sexist, but they wouldn’t do it to a man. They wouldn’t shush like you’re a child in a classroom.” Anna Soubry, a former minister and Conservative MP until she moved to Change UK in 2019, said one Tory colleague used to tease her from the benches during every prime minister’s questions. “In parliament, it gets very hot and stuffy, and I’d sit there and fan myself with the order paper and I’d get this: ‘Ooh, are you having a hot flush dear?’ It really pissed me off because I wasn’t but I didn’t know what to say.” When she pulled the colleague up on it, she said he got defensive and said it was “just a joke”. Soubry believes he was doing it “to try to humiliate”. She added: “Obviously I never complained about it because there was no point.” Soubry also said a fellow Tory MP once made an “incredibly shocking” and “excruciatingly embarrassing” comment about her body that she reported to the whips at the time, who spoke to the man about it. Phillips believes the worst behaviour comes back to a culture of politicians, particularly men, protecting each other. “I think there are some people who do not know how to behave and are covered by power and friendship to behave that way,” she said. “That’s the problem. The culture in Westminster is not an overtly sexist one. The culture in Westminster is one where people protect their own, but their own being men. Men are much more likely to be protected by other men than women are to be protected.” Female clerks, researchers and others working on the parliamentary estate without the status of being an MP can face worse problems. Phillips said: “A lot of clerks in the past have told me that they’ve been treated very sexistly and treated like little girls and like they’re stupid.” Louisa Casson, 30, worked as a political adviser in an MP’s office in her mid 20s before moving to charity work. She said that “laddish banter” was commonplace, with MPs commenting on colleagues’ wives and giggling at puerile jokes. “You’d get quite macho banter in policy meetings which I’d find extraordinary or just quite uncomfortable,” she said. “There was a conversation about blue tits at one point, in the context of the bird, and a couple of MPs were sniggering and making jokes about that.” For women in a tiny minority when they first became MPs, the latest uproar and debate offer hope, despite the behaviour they’ve exposed. Harriet Harman, who by October will have spent 40 years sitting on parliament’s green benches, said: “There’s always been a male impunity for misogyny in the House of Commons. And when there was just a handful of us women MPs, and we were very marginalised, it felt impossible to do anything about it. “It was my everyday experience having a climate of misogyny from MPs that was amplified by a collusive press. But for me and the other women at the time, we just didn’t feel there was anything we could do about it. We just had to grin and bear it and try to get on with our work.” Harman believes the latest backlash against sexism in Westminster could mark its death knell. “It’s not all men [who] are doing it,” she said. “But all women have experienced it in the House of Commons. And they’re just calling time on it. “Now, because there are many more woman MPs, and because they are much more confident and assertive, and because there are woman MPs on all sides, they are not prepared to put up with it anymore. And therefore, the age of male misogyny in the House of Commons is going to end … there’s going to be no hiding place.”",News/Politics,‘It’s rife’: female MPs tell of climate of misogyny in Westminster,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/29/its-just-rife-female-mps-tell-of-climate-of-misogyny-in-westminster
4/30/2022,"“Unless we ensure individuals are brought to justice, nothing will change,” Kate Maltby wrote in the Guardian in 2019. The latest comments about male colleagues’ “wandering hands” from the international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, combined with the fact that no fewer than 56 MPs are under investigation over sexual conduct, suggest that not only have things not changed for the better since Ms Maltby raised her own complaint in 2017, in some respects they may even have got worse. True, some MPs have been held to account for inappropriate behaviour. Damian Green was sacked from his position as first secretary of state in 2017 after an investigation found that he had lied to parliament about pornography on his computer. No definitive conclusion was reached in relation to Ms Maltby’s claim that he had behaved wrongly towards her, although her account was found to be “plausible”. In 2020 the former Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke was sentenced to two years in jail for three sexual assaults – two of them on a parliamentary worker. Another Conservative MP, Imran Ahmad Khan, was this month found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy in 2008, while the Tory MP David Warburton has had the whip removed after allegations emerged of sexual harassment and cocaine use. Labour MP Liam Byrne also faces suspension from the Commons for non-sexual bullying of a male staffer. But others continue to escape punishment, as the Liberal Democrat Lord Lester did when he resigned from the House of Lords in 2018 after peers voted not to sanction him for sexual harassment. Tory MP Crispin Blunt resigned from his position as chair of an all-party LGBT+ rights group this month, after being criticised for publicly attacking Ahmad Khan’s conviction. But the whip was not withdrawn. And Boris Johnson’s whips seemed reluctant, initially, to act against another MP, Neil Parish, who is alleged to have been seen watching pornography at work by two colleagues. Instead, it was suggested that it was for these witnesses to report him to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme set up following #MeToo. On Friday, it was announced that Mr Parish would report himself, and the whip was suspended. That these reports, which include Ms Trevelyan saying she was once “pinned up against a wall” by a male MP, should come just a week after a highly public attempt to humiliate Labour’s Angela Rayner for crossing her legs, makes them all the more dismaying. And there is a sense of rising anger among female MPs, both about the specific behaviour on display in parliament and the culture of impunity that continues to surround MPs; and about wider trends, including the increasing use of pornography in public places, and smartphone-enabled harassment. Still, optimists point to the fact that women are now more likely these days to complain about male behaviour that would previously have been tolerated. And given everything we know about the number of sexual harassment and abuse experiences that go unreported, it is difficult to assert with confidence that sexual misconduct in parliament has become more common, or less, based on anecdotal evidence. What can be stated firmly is that it is damaging both to politics and to society when senior public figures such as MPs treat women with such contempt. Labour has its own difficulties in this area. This month a group of senior women in the party called for an end to the use of confidentiality agreements when allegations are made. But the latest news about Mr Parish, following Ahmad Khan’s conviction, Mr Warburton’s suspension and the scurrilous attack on Ms Rayner, mean that Boris Johnson’s party heads into next week’s local elections in a cloud of sleaze.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on sexism in Westminster: this sleaze harms us all | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/29/the-guardian-view-on-sexism-in-westminster-this-sleaze-harms-us-all
4/30/2022,"As the war in Ukraine and its consequences weaken Russia’s conventional military, Vladimir Putin’s government has resorted to nuclear threats designed to project strength. Mr Putin wants to intimidate his opponents. But his strategy is failing. Instead of Ukraine’s allies backing down, they are stepping up their support. The US Congress this week approved $11bn of arms to Ukraine, three times the total military aid Washington has so far given. The US president, Joe Biden, was right to call out Mr Putin for making “idle comments” about nuclear weapons. It is unthinkable that blunders and miscalculations would take the world to the edge of the nuclear abyss. Yet that is where the world is heading. Whereas the Cuban missile crisis lasted 13 days, Russia’s war is already into its third month. With no clear end in sight, more deadly battles look inevitable – increasing the chances of mistakes. Mr Putin could be using nuclear rhetoric to give the appearance of being unstable. His war is illegal and immoral. His justification for starting the invasion was macabre and ludicrous. However, this may be an act. Russia’s president could be trying to back coercive diplomacy with the “madman theory” of threatening excessive force, which includes the spectre of nuclear weapons. However disagreeable this might seem, a rational Mr Putin, with 2,000 tactical nuclear warheads, is preferable to an irrational one. The concentration of such power in one man’s hands ought to make the world sit up. Russia has few mechanisms to prevent Mr Putin resorting to nuclear weapons if he decided he had nothing to lose. In the Guardian last month, Christopher S Chivvis at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace wrote that in war game scenarios he had taken part in, which considered what would happen if Russia hit Ukraine with nuclear weapons, the only way of de-escalation was when “clear political off-ramps and lines of communication between Moscow and Washington have remained open. In all the other games, the world is basically destroyed.” That is why the US president has been careful not to provide Russia with a reason to go nuclear. Mr Biden made it clear that the US would not place boots on the ground, establish a no-fly zone or conduct intercontinental ballistic missile tests. What Mr Biden has shown is that conventional anti-tank and anti-aircraft technologies have reached a new level of capability, one which has rendered conventional invading ground forces – unless overwhelmingly massed – almost obsolete. Mr Biden has been shrewder than more gung-ho Democrats or their ideological soulmates found in Boris Johnson’s government. Faced with costly military setbacks, Mr Putin has refocused Russia on tightening its hold in Ukraine’s east and south. The fighting might get worse before it gets better. Pursuing Kyiv’s objectives through relatively limited means has worked, though Russia has been able to target civilians indiscriminately. Ukrainians have every right to define their war aims. So do their Nato allies. One of their goals is not to increase the chances that the war becomes a potentially nuclear conflict. Western leaders should therefore reject provocative and escalatory requests out of hand. Nothing else could be more dangerous.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Putin’s nuclear threats: Russia is losing in Ukraine | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/29/the-guardian-view-on-putins-nuclear-threats-russia-is-losing-in-ukraine
4/30/2022,"Big retailers have been accused of putting financial pressure on staff to come into work with Covid-19 after they cut the right to extra sick leave for workers affected by the virus. Sainsbury’s and Tesco are taking away the right to additional sick pay for those with Covid from this weekend, while Next said it had reverted to its standard sick pay policy a few weeks ago. Previously, the businesses offered additional sick leave to workers with coronavirus, to cover those who needed to isolate, as required under government rules. The retailers said they were changing their sick pay rules in line with the government’s new “living with Covid” policy for England that came in on 24 February, under which those who test positive for Covid are no longer legally required to self-isolate. In contrast, Asda said it offers up to 10 days’ extra sick pay for those with coronavirus. Bev Clarkson, the national officer for the union Unite, said: “By scrapping their Covid absence policies, Sainsbury’s and Tesco are encouraging infected staff who are worried about being off to go into work, putting other workers and customers at risk.” Daniel Adams, the national officer for the shopworkers’ union Usdaw, said it was “incredibly disappointed” that Tesco had made the changes. “Inevitably, with these changes, there is a risk that employees may have to make a decision based on affordability rather than their health or wellbeing. The fact that the government has withdrawn even the minimal support of statutory sick pay from day one further exacerbates the problem,” he said. Sainsbury’s and Tesco both said they were asking or encouraging staff to stay at home if they were sick. Nevertheless, the unions said some workers might feel compelled to come into work regardless, if they could not be sure of claiming sick pay. Next said it was following government guidance in leaving the decision up to individuals on whether to come into work after testing positive with Covid, but said it was not aware of any member of staff wanting to do so. A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “We have reviewed our policies in line with the latest government guidance for England, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland. As part of this, we are approaching colleague sick leave relating to Covid-19 just as we would with another illness like flu. “We’re continuing to ask colleagues who test positive or develop Covid-19 symptoms to stay at home and be considerate of others, and any colleagues who need to stay at home and are unable to carry out their roles can continue to receive pay.” The retailer said it was unlikely that anyone with Covid would use up their company sick pay allowance for the year, which amounts to 3% of their annual contracted hours or an average of 10 days, according to the Unite union. The spokesperson said that any decision on further company sick pay beyond a worker’s usual allowance would now be “at their manager’s discretion”. Next, which in January was one of the first major retailers to cut sick pay for its unvaccinated staff who have to isolate after coming into contact with someone who has Covid, said absence with the illness was now “treated in exactly the same way as any other illness absence, with the same sickness payment structure”. Government guidelines currently ask, but don’t legally require those testing positive with Covid to “try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people” for five days after first testing positive. It advises those who do leave home within that period to wear a surgical face mask or other well-fitting face covering, avoid crowded places such as public transport, and to take other precautions such as covering their mouth and nose when they cough or sneeze and washing their hands frequently with soap and water or using hand sanitiser.",News/Business,Sainsbury’s and Tesco criticised for cutting extra Covid sick leave,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/29/sainsburys-tesco-criticised-covid-sick-leave-pay
4/30/2022,"The appointment of Ben Stokes as the England men’s Test captain was always going to generate a little heat. The patient may be sickly. The team – and indeed Test cricket itself, which has been dying since the day it was born – may be twitching on its gurney, breath coming in a rasp. But for now this feels like a shot of adrenaline to the chest. The optics are good. The captaincy adjectives are bracing and terse. Sports writers already love Stokes because he makes that stage feel epic. Broadcasters have a tendency to turn husky and brave in his presence. And on a basic level Stokes is just such a likable, moreish figure. Here is a cricketer who seems completely immersed, who can transform that baroque old dance of batting, bowling and fielding into something entirely his own, an expression of his own will, his own physicality. Shove him out in front of the cameras and he speaks like an authentic human being. He even looks impressively heroic these days, chin jutting, hair swept back in twin ginger wings, the hair of a handsome Victorian lifeboat captain. There is pleasure, then, in Stokes’s appointment, and excitement at what comes next. Not to mention a quality that has been obscured a little by the depressive state of the late Joe Root years, the conviction that the job itself is toxic, that all is ruined, that the best thing would be to shut the curtains and wait for the end. In reality Stokes is both an excellent appointment and a very interesting one. Nothing is guaranteed. England are still terrible at Test cricket. The captain is 30 years old and reckless with his own fitness. But this is a very hopeful fit. Stokes will now face the usual two-phase process. The first task of an England captain is to fix the team. The second is, as ever, to fix English cricket, which is, as previously stated, always dying, but is doing so a little quicker right now. This is just built into the office, a strange Arthurian quality, the sense of something to be preserved and rediscovered, returned to a state of mythical grace. Which is, to be fair, probably one for the longer term. More immediately there are plenty of details Stokes can set about. Selections have been strange. Pressure in the field has been flaccid, bowling tactics muddled. The exclusions of Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson can be fixed. Both should be back in, not to be wheeled around in their bathchairs like heritage exhibits, but asked to perform to a high level and volume without concession to their age, until they either pack it in or their levels drop. Or in other words, as though this is sport you want to win. The batting looks spooked but still capable of more. It might not be overly technical, but some different energy, whatever the opposite is of Eoin Morgan’s vibes-based effect on the white-ball team would be a major uplift. Plus there are the wider elements. The role of red-ball captain now is to lobby, to insist on space, time and resources. Root was biddable. Stokes is more demanding. And this is the real key here. The one thing this role really needs now is advocacy. Stokes needs to act as an evangelist for Test cricket. This is his mission, one he is better qualified than anyone else to carry out, simply by following his nose and playing the game. It is necessary at this point to acknowledge that the role of England cricket captain is massively overstated, not just in its reach, but in is significance to the nation at large. The great lost summer game has spent the last quarter century shrinking back, walled up in its private garden beyond the city limits. To the majority of the population this must all sound a bit like hearing people talk about the royal family as though it actually matters and suddenly you have to remember who the duchess of Wessex is. Is this irretrievable? Is there any way of reversing that process just a little? The fact is nobody has really tried to sell or promote or embolden Test cricket. There is no energy source here, no impresario, no towering figure. Stokes is English cricket’s first celebrity Test captain since Andrew Flintoff. He’s the first Test captain with crossover vibes, the first Test captain who is massive on Instagram. This will sound deeply inane to the legacy fan. But it would be foolish to overlook the power of reach, eyeballs and celebrity wattage. How does football manage to dominate every surface from behind its paywall? What is the Hundred for? Stokes has more Twitter followers than the ECB. And no one else out there is willing or able to sell this game like the new skipper, who also loves Test cricket, and who sees it as something worth saving. Another thing about Stokes, he’s an outlier, a state school-educated England Test captain, maybe even the last of the line. And whether by accident or design, he connects. People adore him. He doesn’t look like he’s part of an exclusive club, or like he’s going to ask you to stay off the lawn. To watch him is not only to feel entertained, but to get the game, to feel its theatre and its tensions. There has been some talk about the demands all this will place on Stokes, as though he might simply be too busy to be England Test captain. But maybe all the other things he’s been doing aren’t as important. This is what is left for him after the World Cup, the franchise fortune, the ICC gongs. Stokes has looked for a while like someone searching for another battle. Test cricket is his mission. There are no saviours, no magic cures, no deathbed miracles. But it will be eventful. And we do at least have something that feels like a pulse.",Sport/Sport,Ben Stokes has the drive and celebrity wattage to revive the pulse of Test cricket | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/29/ben-stokes-has-the-drive-and-celebrity-wattage-to-revive-the-pulse-of-test-cricket
4/30/2022,"Frasers Group, the owner of Sports Direct, House of Fraser and Flannels, has delayed publication of its full annual results for the third time in four years, blaming a logjam in the audit industry. The group, which is controlled by Mike Ashley, said full results would be delayed by at least a month as “the timing of the acquisition and resource constraints within the audit industry as a whole”, meant it could not include figures for its newly acquired business, Studio Retail, until September. However, the rest of the group’s annual results will be released in July, as planned, and the company said it continued to expect pre-tax profits of between £300m and £350m for the year to 24 April. Frasers paid £26.8m to acquire Studio Retail, which sells cut-price own-brand products from clothing and furnishings to gifts and cards, out of administration in February. A statement released on Friday afternoon said the delay in the group’s results related to the need for “specialist skills and experience” to audit Studio Retail’s financial statements which “contain significant judgemental areas, particularly around consumer credit related provisions”. However, the delay has echoes of previous audit woes for Ashley’s empire. The group, under its former name Sports Direct, was labelled “an embarrassment to UK corporate governance” in 2019 after the chaotic announcement of its annual results, including multiple delays and the shock revelation of a €674m (£614m) tax bill. The debacle led to an acrimonious split with the accounting firm Grant Thornton, and then more than a month’s delay before the appointment of its replacement, RSM. The company was forced to send a letter to the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, explaining its difficulties in finding a suitable adviser to check its annual accounts. In 2020, Frasers again delayed its results presentation – this time for a week – saying it needed more time to complete an audit.",News/Business,Frasers Group delays release of annual results for third time in four years,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/29/frasers-group-delays-release-of-annual-results-for-third-time-in-four-years
