1/15/2022,"What’s your favourite scary movie? If you came of age in the 90s there’s a strong chance it was Wes Craven’s 1996 slasher Scream, not just because it was (and still is) a genuine masterwork, but because it arrived during a decade when the quality of horror films was scarier than the content.  Scream was a rare horror film that existed in a world where people actually watched horror films, so trying to avoid getting stabbed meant being hyper-aware of the rules that underpinned the genre, brutally instilled by two fanboy killers. The series proceeded with predictably diminishing returns but, for a slasher franchise, the sequels were still smarter than most, crafting a fairly detailed universe of interconnected bloodbaths and the inevitable films based off them (the knowingly wretched Stab franchise). A decade after the hugely underrated fourth chapter, Ghostface is back in Scream (the same title being a jokey reference to a theme in the film although really more of a way to lure in a broader audience outside of Scream completists), but is his or her return from creative necessity or just commercial inevitability? Here is a very spoiler-heavy discussion of Nu Scream: Ever since Drew Barrymore misremembered the specifics of Friday the 13th and found her insides on the outside as penalty, the quality of a Scream film has been judged within the first 15 minutes, a grisly opening kill that sets the tone for what comes after. Scream 4 outsmarted our expectations with a fun wrong-footing cold open within a cold open within a cold open, which led to speculation about how the new chapter might do something even wilder, stakes raised and rules rewritten. But while some had predicted that perhaps one of the OG pin cushions might be at risk, what’s most surprising about the start of Scream 22 is how straightforward it all is. The set-up is a back-to-basics callback to how it all started with You and Yes Day teen Jenna Ortega as Tara, the sacrificial Casey-shaped lamb, less recognisable this time perhaps but still fielding trivia questions from Ghostface. There are minor tweaks – the questions are about the Stab franchise rather than IRL slashers, she’s hounded by both landline and smartphone – but the most notable change is that, for the first time in the series, the first victim actually survives the attack … The reason being that Tara was in fact just bait to lure her sister Samantha (In the Heights’ Melissa Barrera) back to Woodsboro, along with boyfriend Richie (The Boys’ Jack Quaid) who’s mostly unaware of the trauma that’s haunted the town ever since the original killings. Samantha is a reformed wild child who left town after raising hell and never came back. The killer soon contacts her, teasing that he or she knows her secret, which we discover is an unfortunate familial tie: Samantha is the illegitimate daughter of Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), one of the original killers. It’s a fun, goofy link, and one that’s very much in line with the franchise’s charmingly soapy mythology but, in a misjudged piece of fan service, Ulrich frequently appears to Samantha as a vision, urging her to lean into her murderous heritage. Samantha then becomes the new final girl but one with an edge – she might also be a killer – a not-too-dissimilar set-up to the fourth film’s positioning of Sidney’s niece Jill as fake-out heroine who turns out to be the villain. She’s not the only new cast member with a connection to the past. Tara’s group of friends includes the niece and nephew of Randy (Jamie Kennedy) who died in the second film and the son of Judy (Marley Shelton) who was introduced in the fourth. The links between old and new inevitably leads Samantha to … Walking wounded they may be, but it’s a miracle that three core Scream survivors are even walking at all, having faced off against various Ghostfaces in every one of the previous films. One of the smartest touches in 2011’s Scream 4 was to set up the structure of a reboot with a young cast primed to take over but then kill them all off either as victims or villains (“D0n’t fuck with the original,” Campbell quips at the end, echoing widespread reboot fatigue at the time). Here, there’s less cohesion between young and old, the latter particularly, at times criminally, wasted. We’re first reunited with Dewey (Arquette), now living in a trailer, retired from the force and seeing his ex-wife Gale (Cox) only on her morning show. He’s dragged back into the drama by Samantha, craving advice on how to survive which leads to an update of the “here are the rules” speech that advises her not to trust her boyfriend (more on that later) and that the motive is somehow connected to the past. We’re also reunited with Judy, a minor character from the last film, and Randy’s sister Martha, allowing for a small scene with Heather Matarazzo who appeared in the third (an Easter egg later showing a YouTube link to an interview with “survivor Kirby Reed” also confirms that the Scream 4 fan favourite, played by Hayden Panettiere, is also still alive). Dewey reluctantly calls Sidney to warn her, which allows us to learn that she now has kids and is married to Mark (who we can assume is Patrick Dempsey’s Mark from Scream 3) but urges her to stay away. After Scream 4 survivor Judy is killed along with her son Wes, we then see the return of Gale, eager for the story, who shares a poignant, if within the larger context of the series repetitive, scene with Dewey – added poignancy because of the off-screen history shared by Cox and Arquette. But any chance of a romantic reunion is curtailed when … It had to happen some time. Every new Scream teases the death of one of the old guard (trailers for 4 suggested it was Gale’s turn) and after marketing for the latest featured only minimal scenes of the main trio, it was seen as a given that someone had to go. But as the only returning cast member to get even the slightest bit of character texture this time around, it’s a shame that Dewey is the one who finds himself on the chopping block. It’s an effectively nasty way to go; a hospital corridor slaying that sees the killer stab Dewey in both his front and back simultaneously, creepily bragging that “it’s an honour” to be the one who gets to murder someone so infamous (the violence throughout feels gnarlier than usual). But it does suck some of the energy from the film, leaving Gale and a returning Sidney to mope before being thrust into the climax … In the final act, the characters are all drawn to the house owned by Billy’s partner-in-crime Stu, the location of the first film’s extended bloodbath finale. It’s where Tara’s best friend Amber (Better Things star Mikey Madison) lives, and where she’s hosting a boozy, ill-advised memorial for their friend Wes. The teens are partying through the grief while also starting to question who out of them might be the killer (it’s easily the most paranoid of the Screams so far). There are notable callbacks to the original – Amber goes to the garage to get beer a la Tatum while Randy’s niece Mindy (Yellowjackets’ Jasmin Savoy Brown) replicates her uncle’s drunk horror movie couch-watch – but they mostly serve to remind us how little we know or care about the undeveloped teens this time around, despite strong performances across the board. There’s too many of them and they have too little do do, which is why when killer #1 is revealed – Amber – it’s met with an “Oh … that one” shrug. Madison does well, recycling her manic shtick from Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, but the impact of her betrayal to BFF Tara is less a stab and more a light graze. Then in yet another callback, killer #2 is unmasked – Richie, the scream queen’s boyfriend turning evil once again. Quaid’s ranting is a little repetitive but in-between the guff, there are some decent half-ideas, all explaining the hows and whys … So while previous Screams have satirised sequels, trilogies and reboots, this time it’s the “requel”, also know as the legacy sequel, when older characters return alongside the new blood, explained by Mindy earlier in the film. What’s driving the two killers this time is fury with the eighth Stab movie which pissed off fans by completely jumping the shark, giving Ghostface a metallic mask, a flamethrower and a sleeveless muscle tee. Stab super-fans Amber and Ritchie met on Reddit and concocted a plan to course-correct the series. If they enacted a more faithful set of killings, the next Stab film would be forced to tell that story instead, therefore saving the franchise. The real villains are therefore toxic fans (“How can fandom be toxic?” Ritchie asks), something anyone who’s spent at least five minutes on the internet will be on board with, and even if the writing is a little heavy-handed (Stab 8 directed by Rian Johnson after the whole Last Jedi brouhaha is a bit much), it’s still a smart-ish way to justify a return to Woodsboro. Yet despite being aware of the rules of a requel, the writers aren’t quite able to follow them very well. What made Force Awakens such a success was the well-calibrated mix of old and new but here, the original cast members are sidelined so much that they ultimately feel like reluctant cameos. Gale and Sidney are truly wasted and while Campbell and Cox manage to conjure some magic thanks to their long histories with the characters, they’re almost superfluous in the messy finale (shooting Gale as soon as she arrives is a thunderously bad idea). Their survival at the end seems to mean less to the makers than the survival of the newbies, all seemingly primed for the next chapter (essentially doing the very thing Scream 4 was ridiculing). A strong start at the box office suggests there’s more to come – but what next?",Arts/Film,"Scream: new characters, new rules, new killers – discuss with spoilers",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/15/scream-film-wes-craven-slasher-spoilers
1/15/2022,"At 92, Edward Sorel is the grand old man of New York magazines. For 60 years, his blistering caricatures have lit up the pages of Harper’s, the Atlantic, Esquire, Time, Rolling Stone and the Nation. He is especially revered for his work in Clay Felker’s New York in the late 60s and for work in the New Yorker under Tina Brown and David Remnick.  He has also worked for slightly less august titles, like Penthouse, Screw and Ramparts. He is one of the foundational New Yorkers. Like Leonard Bernstein or E B White, Sorel absorbs the rhythms of the rambunctious city, using them to create an exaggerated, beguiling mirror of all he has experienced. A very abbreviated list of his memories includes the Great Depression, Hitler and Mussolini, the Red Scare, Joe McCarthy, Lee Harvey Oswald, both Bushes, Clinton, Obama and Trump. His memoir begins with a political frame. Like the unreconstructed lefty he is – he voted for Ralph Nader twice – he announces that he will show how the crimes of the previous 12 presidents made possible the catastrophe of Donald Trump. He gives the CIA and the military industrial complex all the shame they deserve for an unending parade of coups and wars – from Iran, Guatemala and Chile to Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. But he promises “these exposés will be brief”, so “it will only hurt for a few minutes”. On that he keeps his word. What gives Profusely Illustrated its charm and its power – besides 177 spectacular illustrations – are Sorel’s tales of New York, beginning with a childhood spent in a fifth-floor walk-up in the Bronx with a father he despised and a mother he adored. Sorel spares no one, especially his “stupid, insensitive, grouchy, mean-spirited, fault-finding, racist” father, who he dreamed of pushing in front of a subway train when he was only eight or nine. “When I grew older, I realized how wrong that would have been,” Sorel writes.“The motorman would have seen me.” The first riddle that tortured him was why his amazing mother married his revolting father. She explained that a few months after her arrival in New York from Romania, at 16, she started work in a factory that made women’s hats. When one of the hat blockers noticed on her first day that she hadn’t left for lunch, he loaned her the nickel she needed. Later, the same blocker told her he would kill himself if she didn’t marry him. So that was that. During a prolonged childhood illness that confined him to his bed, Ed started making drawings on cardboard that came back with shirts from a Chinese laundry. When he went back to school, the drawings were admired by his teacher at PS90, who told his mother young Ed had talent. She enrolled him in a Saturday art class at the other end of the city, the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and then another at the Little Red School House, at the bottom of Manhattan. At Little Red, thanks to the generosity of one Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, all the students were given a wooden box containing oil paints, brushes, turpentine and an enamel palette. It was Ed’s “to keep so I could paint at home” – and it changed his life. He gained admission to the highly competitive High School of Music and Art, and then to tuition-free art school at Cooper Union. But his teachers did nothing but delay his success: the fashion for abstraction was so intense, he wasn’t allowed to do the realistic work he loved. The Bronx boy who had been Eddie Schwartz was transformed after he discovered Julien Sorel, hero of Stendhal’s novel The Red and the Black. Julien was “a sensitive young peasant who hated his father, was appalled by the corruption of the clergy in 19th-century France, and was catnip to every woman he encountered”. Five years later, Eddie changed his name to Sorel. With Seymour Chast he founded Push Pin Studios, which after Milton Glaser joined, became the hottest design studio in New York. Sorel didn’t last long but when Glaser founded New York magazine with Felker a few years later, Sorel got the perfect outlet for his increasingly powerful caricatures. His book’s pleasures include interactions with all the most important magazine editors of the second half of the last century, including George Lois, art director of Esquire in its heyday under Harold Hayes. Gay Talese had written what would become a very famous profile, Frank Sinatra Has a Cold. The crooner had refused to pose for the cover, after Lois told him he wanted a close up with a cigarette in his mouth and a gaggle of sycophants eagerly trying to light it. Lois asked Sorel for an illustration. It was an assignment that would give him “more visibility than I had ever had before”. He panicked and his first effort was a failure. But with only one night left, his “adrenalin somehow made my hand turn out a terrific drawing of Frank Sinatra”. It launched Sorel’s career. The original now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery. The Village Voice, New York’s original counterculture newspaper, gave him a weekly spot. Sorel inked a memorable portrait of the New York Times editor Abe Rosenthal as a tank shooting a too-liberal columnist, Sydney Schanberg, after Schanberg was fired for attacking the news department from the op-ed page. Tina Brown chose Sorel to do her first New Yorker cover. When Woody Allen and Mia Farrow split up, Sorel imagined a Woody & Mia Analysts Convention. If you’re looking for a bird’s eye view of the glory days of magazine journalism, illustrated with drawings guaranteed to make you nostalgic for great battles of years gone by, Profusely Illustrated is perfect. When you’re done, you’ll be ready to rewatch Mad Men all over again.

1/15/2022,"In this year’s Guardian and Observer charity appeal we have supported communities and individuals hit hardest by the climate emergency, people who have seen their lives upended and livelihoods lost by extreme weather. It’s a topical issue, and not going away – and there is still time to donate: so far we have raised over £800,000. Our appeal is shaped by vivid stories of climate emergency: floods, drought and wildfires; from reindeer killed by unnatural arctic heat to chronic crop failure by the shores of Lake Victoria. At its heart, however, lies inequality and poverty: the stark truth is the countries least responsible for global emissions have by far suffered worst from climate-induced disasters.  Thousands of readers have so far given generously to the appeal – and hundreds of you have emailed us to tell us why. You told us the climate crisis is the most urgent issue facing the planet, and that world’s wealthiest economies – as many delegates at the recent Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow made clear – have a moral responsibility to help the poorest cope with increasingly grave climate challenges. Giving to the appeal felt for many readers like a way of registering support for wider change. As one said: “My donation is a tiny contribution to the efforts of all those working to preserve this precious world we live in.” It was also, many of you said, an acknowledgment that even a relatively small charitable investment in local expertise, resilience and innovation can deliver social dividends. Other donors said they were inspired by reading about our partner charities. Some described the alarming impact of extreme weather on family and friends who lived on the front lines of climate change. Giving was for some donors a small but important protest against government climate policy, or aid budget cuts, or the excesses of western consumption and material exploitation. Whatever your reasons, the money we raise together will be shared among our four fantastic charities: Practical Action, Global Greengrants Fund UK, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, and Environmental Justice Foundation. All do brilliant work to help tackle the climate emergency, and offer important hope and optimism for the future. Thanks to your generous donations, Practical Action will continue to invest in local communities with innovative tools and adaptations, from agricultural technology to flood warning systems. Environmental Justice Foundation will continue to provide powerful testimony of the human impact of climate change and fight for the rights of climate refugees. Global Greengrants Fund UK will distribute its share of donations to grassroots climate projects in the global south, reminding us that “small farmers cool the planet”. Royal Botanic Gardens Kew will pursue its vital work to preserve biodiversity and revitalise denuded land on the island of Madagascar. As ever, I’d like to appeal to those of who have not yet given to consider doing so – and to thank the more than 7,000 of you who have already done so. We appreciate your generosity, spirit, and your commitment to a fairer, greener and more just world. Your donations are inspiring – and they will make a difference.

1/15/2022,"Tesco’s banking arm has launched a prepaid debit card with a linked savings account that is available to the 20 million customers who hold one of the retailer’s Clubcards. The new offering, called Tesco Clubcard Pay+, is designed to help people to budget and save, the company said. You can top up the debit card from any UK bank account.  Clubcard Pay+ is not designed to be used as your main bank account, and it should not be confused with a fully fledged current account. It does not have an overdraft, you cannot set up direct debits, and there are fees to be aware of. Customers get a payment account with a debit card that can be used anywhere Visa is accepted, plus a savings account called Round Up. Shoppers can add money to their Clubcard Pay+ account – allowing them to ringfence their grocery spend if they wish – by linking it to any UK bank account, using the Tesco Bank app. Customers can also opt to “save while they shop” by rounding up their purchases to the nearest pound, with the difference being paid into the Round Up account. This account pays a variable 0.25% interest, and shoppers can manage it via the app. Your Round Up balance can be transferred out of your account at any time. Several other UK banks, including Lloyds, Halifax and the new digital player Chase, offer similar features that let people turn their spare change into savings. Interest rates on these vary: some of the eligible accounts at Lloyds Bank pay as little as 0.01%, while Chase is currently offering 5%. The launch of this new way to pay comes only weeks after Tesco Bank shut down all its current accounts. Pay+ was initially offered to a limited number of customers last March and is now available to all Clubcard members living in the UK and aged 18 or over. The debit card acts as your Clubcard. As an extra perk, for the first 100 days after an account is opened, customers receive one extra Clubcard point for every £1 spent in Tesco with Clubcard Pay+. In addition to the points collected in Tesco, you also get one Clubcard point for every £8 spent outside Tesco (there are some exclusions). There are a number of things that Clubcard Pay+ does not allow, including direct debits and standing orders. Also watch out for the fact that if your account balance goes below zero – for example, if a shop accepts a payment without checking there is enough money in your account – you will need to top it up immediately. If you don’t, Tesco Bank says: “We may take steps to suspend and ultimately close your Clubcard Pay+ and Round Up accounts.” However, the bank will not hit you with fees for refusing or allowing payments linked to a lack of funds. At the moment, the bank is not offering joint accounts or allowing other people to be added to the account but that could change later. This is not a great card to use abroad: a 2.75% foreign exchange fee applies to all Clubcard Pay+ debit card transactions made outside the UK. If you make an overseas ATM cash withdrawal in a foreign currency (excluding the euro), you will need to pay an additional 1% cash withdrawal fee. Money held in the accounts is protected up to a total of £85,000 by the official Financial Services Compensation Scheme. This move represents an expansion of Tesco Bank’s financial services ambitions after it closed down all its current accounts in November last year, seven years after launching into that market. The MoneySavingExpert.com website says that while Clubcard Pay+ could be an easy way to pick up some extra points in the short-term, “in the long-term it’s possible to earn much more in points or cashback using a rewards credit card, provided you only use this for normal spending and pay it off in full each month”.",Lifestyle/Money,Tesco launches prepaid debit card with linked savings account,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/15/tesco-launches-prepaid-debit-card-with-linked-savings-account
1/15/2022,"Taxpayers are being warned to beware of online agents that offer to help them claim rebates from HMRC, then pocket up to half of any payments. Claims firms appear to be taking advantage of tax relief payments owed to millions of people who were forced to work from home during the pandemic.  Some of the websites suggest applicants could receive hundreds of pounds in government rebates if they submit a claim via the agent. However, people may be unwittingly signing over the rights to up to 50% of any refunds due to them from the last tax year, plus any backdated claims for the previous four years. A tax rebate is a repayment of overpaid tax by HMRC. HMRC automatically identifies any anomalies in tax payments between June and November after the tax year ends and sends affected taxpayers a P800 form that asks them to check their records. HMRC has an online calculator to help work out what they should have paid. Claims for tax credits for working from home or uniforms can be made direct via HMRC’s online portal and backdated by up to four years. The Low Incomes Tax Reform Group (LITRG) is urging the government to crack down on traders who exploit unwitting claimants. “For many years now we have received queries from the public affected by unscrupulous companies, some of whom were misled into thinking they were dealing with HMRC,” said Joanne Walker, an LITRG technical officer. “Recently we have seen an increasing number of people who have signed a deed or letter assigning all their tax refunds to the company – which then deducts its fee even though it has not done any work to claim the money. In some cases, the taxpayer is not aware they signed a deed.” Andrea Jackson received a letter from HMRC last month advising her that she was due a refund of £973 for the tax year 2019-20. However, the letter stated that the payment would made to a company called Tax Returned. “When I telephoned HMRC, they informed me they had acted upon my letter of authority instructions,” she said. “I cannot recall giving anyone authority.” Jackson later received her money minus £327, which Tax Returned had deducted in fees. She discovered that she had signed a deed of assignment in June 2020, which stated in small print that it unconditionally allowed the company to receive all rebates payable for the previous four tax years. Tax Returned’s homepage boasts that claimants can apply online in three minutes by clicking a claim button and that it secured a refund of £8,614 for one applicant. The fees of 28% plus VAT and the requirement to sign a deed of assignment are mentioned on a separate webpage. The company receives five stars from 83% of reviewers on Trustpilot but Guardian Money found that many of those reviewers had been sent targeted invitations as soon as they had filled out a claim. Tax Returned did not respond to a request for a comment. Trustpilot confirmed that it had issued a warning to the company last year after evidence suggested it was “cherrypicking” reviews. It told Guardian Money that Tax Returned had since stopped inviting selected customers for feedback. A lack of regulation means that anyone can set up a tax refund firm, and while there are many qualified businesses that provide tailored tax advice, others are merely a web presence run from a PO Box address. The company names tend to be variations on the words tax rebates or tax refunds so that they appear at the top of a Google search, and some generate positive reviews by incentivising customers to post feedback as soon as they have completed the application form. One firm promised a charitable donation for every review. The websites typically offer a free estimate and advertise eye-catching sums allegedly won for previous customers. Visitors are then encouraged to make an online claim by submitting details they can send for free via the HMRC portal. In the sites tested by Guardian Money, the hefty fees and onerous contract terms were only visible after clicking through to the terms and conditions. Customers who want an agent to claim a specific rebate on their behalf can submit a letter to HMRC directing them to make a one-off payment to the company. Some claims firms, however, ask customers to sign a legally binding deed of assignment, which entitles the agent to receive any rebates due for the past four tax years, even those that the customer has claimed without the firm’s help. The deed cannot be revoked without the company’s agreement. According to LITRG, some customers who made a past PPI claim through a third party have found their signature and national insurance number transposed on to a deed so that a company can cash in on any pending tax refunds. Others report submitting what they thought was an inquiry form and finding they had been signed up to an irrevocable contract. Not only does the claimant forfeit a chunk of their payments, they could face large penalties. The percentage pricing structure used by claims firms is an incentive for agents to inflate tax claims. If HMRC discovers foul play, it is the taxpayer, not the agent, who is held liable. LITRG says it has urged HMRC to check that deeds of assignments meet its own guidance before accepting them. The guidance includes the requirement that the wording and scope of the assignment must be clearly stated above the signature box. HMRC told the Guardian Money it takes “firm action” against companies that breach the law. A spokesperson said: “We recognise some customers feel they’ve been misled by tax refund companies. We have listened to customers and stakeholders and we will be running a consultation this year on tackling the high costs of claiming tax refunds through some of these companies. We encourage customers to come to HMRC directly to make their claims. It takes only a few minutes to complete the online application, and eligible claims receive 100% of their entitlement.” When Heather Russell chased a £1,330 rebate promised by HMRC she discovered the cheque had been sent to a company called Tax Credits Ltd. HMRC explained that it was legally required to pay the firm because of a deed of assignment in her name. Tax Credits notified her that it would remit the sum, minus a 48% service fee, provided she send copies of ID and her bank details. Russell’s husband, Alan, says that she applied for the rebate herself and has no memory of engaging the company. “She was advised by Trading Standards not to send personal documents to this company, so she hasn’t received any of it,” he said. “Tax Credits has since told her that she reached its website via a Google or Facebook search and signed up on 16 April last year but the form they say she signed is dated 6 April. I wrote to their registered address asking for evidence but my letter was returned with a ‘not known at this address’ message.” Guardian Money asked Tax Credits for a copy of the contract. It provided a signed application form headed “Tax Rebate Application” and addressed to HMRC. Small print at the bottom says that the signatory “unconditionally” assigns the tax repayment to Tax Credits at its registered Cardiff address, which is in the same building as the Welsh division of HMRC. There is no company name or logo at the top of the form, which looks, at first glance, as though it is an official tax document. Many of the customers who have denounced the firm on Trustpilot say they had thought they were dealing with HMRC. Asked about the discrepancy in dates, a spokesperson stated: “The system had simply printed a date on the form of 6 April.” The firm did not comment on why its paperwork does not have a company header and claimed that its registered address is still valid. When questioned about the unanimously negative online reviews, it stated that it does not contact happy customers to leave feedback. “Any potential claimants that engage though our website are sent paperwork to sign before we begin,” a spokesperson said. “This paperwork clearly details that repayments are issued at 52p in the pound.”",Lifestyle/Money,UK taxpayers warned over high charges from rebate claims firms,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/15/uk-taxpayers-warned-over-high-charges-from-rebate-claims-firms

1/15/2022,"Even for a White House familiar with roadblocks and frustration, Thursday’s setbacks on vaccine mandates and voting rights came as hammer blows. Aside from the immediate derailing of two key policy tenets of Joe Biden’s administration, the vaccine ruling by the supreme court, which quickly followed Democratic senator Kyrsten Sinema’s public assassination of his voting reform efforts, prompted a new round of questions over whether his presidency was doomed.  Crucially, serious agonizing is now going on about what Biden’s woes might mean for the Democratic party’s fortunes in midterm elections later this year, when Republicans are tipped to seize back control of both chambers of Congress. With Biden’s public popularity sinking – in one poll this week to a new low of 33% – and with another centrist Democratic senator, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, having already capsized the president’s flagship $1.75tn Build Back Better domestic spending plan, some analysts say time is running short to impress voters ahead of the November polls. “The whole first year is gone. And in the end, nothing,” said Larry Sabato, founder and director of the University of Virginia’ Center for Politics, referring to the lengthy but fruitless discussions with Manchin over the make-up of the plan. “Manchin led him down the rosy patch then threw him into the briar patch. ‘Would you change that? You changed that, well, I don’t like this thing over here. Oh, you changed that, well, there’s these two things …’” Sabato added: “But the voting rights debacle is the worst of all because why was Biden elected other than that people wanted to get rid of Trump? It was because he was seen as experienced and competent. What’s the experience gotten us exactly? I just don’t understand how we got here.” Several of Biden’s misfortunes, Sabato said, are not directly of his own making. He has made repeated efforts to change the minds of both Manchin and Sinema, most recently in seemingly unsuccessful late-night talks at the White House on Thursday in an attempt to salvage his agenda. But Sabato also believes that the president’s handling of various situations, and poor direction from advisers, particularly over the Covid-19 pandemic, runaway inflation, and last year’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, have combined to leave Biden exposed. About inflation, Sabato says: “Biden’s team simply missed it badly, they got it very, very wrong, and they’re continuing probably to get it wrong. They’re downplaying it and they’re going to tame it by mid-year. Maybe, but I’ll be surprised.” On Afghanistan, Sabato said, Biden “threw it away again”. “It could have been a big plus had it been handled correctly because just about everybody – Democrat, Republican – was more than willing to get out of Afghanistan. It was a very bad performance by his team. They couldn’t know what was gonna happen? He’s responsible for his advisers, so he can be blamed for it.” On Friday, the White House press secretary Jen Psaki announced that the president would hold a rare, formal press conference next Wednesday to mark his first year in office. As well as answering difficult questions about the administration’s failures, Biden will talk up its successes, namely the $1tn infrastructure bill he signed in November, and the $1.9tn Covid relief plan from last spring. Having appeared fatigued by Thursday’s rejections, a more buoyant Biden followed up with his own briefing on Friday afternoon, accompanied by Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor he appointed to oversee the implementation of the infrastructure act. “There’s a lot of talk about disappointments and things we haven’t gotten done. We’re going to get a lot of them done, I might add,” Biden said. “But this [infrastructure] is something we did get done, and it’s of enormous consequence to the country.” Some analysts suggest the touting of past glories displays a lack of confidence in what can still be achieved in the almost 10 months until the midterms, something Biden seemed to acknowledge on Thursday when he said: “I don’t know whether we can get this done,” after a Capitol Hill meeting with Democrats over voting rights. The obstacles ahead of Biden are certainly substantial. They range from Democrats’ internal divisions between progressives and moderates, stonewalling by Republicans in Congress and the Donald Trump-created conservative super-majority on the supreme court that has already delivered several blows, and appears poised this summer to overturn five decades of abortion rights. Yet Biden is committed to trying to salvage what he can from what promises to be a testing few months. “Like every other major civil rights bill that came along, if we miss the first time, we can come back and try it a second time,” he told reporters about voting rights efforts. Similarly, he is also likely to attempt to get through Congress individual elements of the Build Back Better plan that are acceptable to Senate moderates, including universal pre-kindergarten education, subsidized child care and a number of climate provisions. “They may try to get pieces of Build Back Better, or build back something as we now call it, but everyone’s going to describe it as crumbs from the table,” Sabato said. “If they’d started with that, people would say, ‘Wow, that’s incredible, pre-K for everybody’, or whatever piece they decided to pick, it didn’t really matter which one. But now it will appear to people as this tiny piece of what the president started out with, [and] tremendous disappointment in Democratic ranks. By the end of the story you won’t even know what passed.” In November last year, Biden, who will be 81 at the time of the 2024 presidential election, announced his intention to run for a second term. Publicly at least, he retains the support of his party, but the Washington Post reported in December rumblings of discontent in Democratic circles about his leadership. An opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal this week, citing the unpopularity of both Biden and Vice-president Kamala Harris, even floated the idea of a comeback for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee beaten by Trump in 2016, to fill what its authors called a “leadership vacuum”. In the wake of this week’s disappointments, the possibility of an alternative Democratic ticket for 2024 emerged again, the Washington Post columnist and political analyst Perry Bacon Jr suggesting there were “plenty of strong candidates” if Biden or Harris do not run. “Biden hasn’t cracked some magic political code. Despite his white maleness and appeals to unity, Washington is gridlocked, Republican voters hate the president and his party is poised to do poorly in the midterms,” Bacon wrote on Friday. “It seems entirely possible that Biden runs in 2024 and loses to a Republican challenger. Democrats simply might be better off with someone new.”",News/US news,Joe Biden’s low point: can the president revive his sinking popularity?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/14/joe-bidens-low-point-can-the-president-revive-his-sinking-popularity
1/15/2022,"In February 2021, Dr Craig Spencer wrote in a Medium post that he was as “eager as anyone to see the end of this pandemic. Thankfully, that may be in sight”.  “Covid cases and hospitalizations are dropping,” wrote Spencer, director of Global Health in Emergency Medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. “Vaccines are getting into arms. So, what happens next?” Next was, of course, more Covid-19. So – almost a year later – while Spencer is encouraged by the fact that the growth in the number of new Covid cases has slowed in parts of the country, he has been humbled by earlier waves and is not ready to celebrate the beginning of the end of the pandemic. “It’s not like you get to the top of Everest, have a small party and then start your ascent down and take off your oxygen mask,” Spencer said. “There is still risk when you start your descent, and I think it’s important for all of us to continue to be wary and aware of that.” While the United States has over the last month broken records for Covid hospitalizations and cases due to the highly contagious Omicron variant, the Northeast has seen a decrease in the number of daily new Covid cases or a slowing down of the rate of increase, prompting predictions that the worst of the pandemic will soon be over. But infectious disease experts say that’s premature because of how unpredictable the virus has been and the fact that it is still surging and overwhelming hospitals in parts of the country. “Yes, particularly in places like New York City, Omicron is peaking, but I think we have to be very careful not to confuse peaking with a low,” said Dr Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at New York University. “That means people who are going out and about, living their normal lives need to be careful to still make use of mitigation measures like wearing higher-quality masks and doing as much outdoors as possible.” In the Northeast, the number of daily new cases has started to decline in the last week, according to data from the New York Times, but other places continue to experience a spike in cases. For example, 10 states saw a more than 300% increase in cases over the last two weeks. Across the United States, there has been a 133% increase in cases and a 79% increase in Covid hospitalizations over that period. “I think it’s very possible that we may be at a peak, and certainly that would be in line with a lot of modeling results in terms of timing, which projected peaks in mid to late January, but at the same until we see a few more days of consistent downward trends and start to see that reflected in hospitalizations as well, I would be cautious,” said Justin Lessler, an epidemiology professor at the University of North Carolina. Despite the slowing down of the surge, when Spencer worked a shift earlier this week in the emergency room at Columbia in New York, “it was just as chaotic for me as it was for my colleagues around the city”, he said. That’s because the emergency room was filled with patients who were very sick with Covid in addition to people coming for heart attacks, appendicitis or other ailments, as compared to the start of the pandemic when almost all the patients in emergency rooms were there because of Covid, Spencer said. There is also a significant number of providers who are unable to work because they tested positive for Covid. “Emergency rooms have always been adaptable, but the issue we are dealing with now is not just more patients and more Covid but also fewer providers and fewer places to put [patients],” said Spencer. In Oklahoma, a 363% increase over the past two weeks has overwhelmed hospitals. Three hospital systems reported that they had no intensive care unit beds available, according to KFOR-TV. At OU Health in Oklahoma City, the spike in Covid cases poses a challenge for providers treating patients with the virus but also for non-Covid patients because the hospital must take additional measures to protect them from the virus, said Dr Dale Bratzler, the hospital’s chief Covid officer. There are also 250 staff members who are unable to work because they are isolating due to the virus, he said. While Bratzler hopes that the state could reach its Omicron peak in the next week, he is concerned that the decline could be slower than in other states because only 54% of the population is fully vaccinated, whereas in New York the number is 73%. “I am much more worried that we will have a substantial increase in hospitalizations over the next few weeks. We are already stretched in our systems, and since unvaccinated people are driving hospitalizations, I am very worried about that,” said Bratzler. Still, Aaron Wendelboe, an OU epidemiologist, said that he is “a bit encouraged by what is happening in other states”. But like other epidemiologists, Wendelboe said he is not ready to declare that we won’t see another surge like Omicron because the virus continues to mutate. “I feel like I am a slower learner,” he said, “because I would not have predicted this big of a surge so quickly but Covid continues to surprise us.”",News/World news,"As Covid-19 peak seems to near, experts warn against letting guard down ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/covid-19-peak-near-experts-warn-guard-down

1/15/2022,"Lacey Haynes is a women’s “intuitive healer”, and guides couples in yoga-informed “elevated sex”. When she opens her front door, the first thing I notice about the Canadian podcaster is her fashionable faux fur slippers and chic blunt fringe. Where is the western wellness guru uniform of linen tunic, elephant-print trousers and culturally inappropriate head jewellery, I wonder? Inside the living room, I spot the hot-pink sofa that Haynes’ Australian husband, Flynn Talbot, a men’s life coach and fellow elevated sex practitioner, calls “love island”. Fans of their podcast – Lacey and Flynn Have Sex – will know it as one of many locations around their house where they take the title literally, recording themselves having sex in the bedroom, on the kitchen barstool, and beyond.  But it’s not the sex that’s the main event – it’s the talk. In each episode Haynes, 37, and Talbot, 40, discuss techniques and topics around sex and relationships, covering everything from overcoming rejection to the joys of cunnilingus; from rethinking orgasm as the ultimate goal to navigating intimacy with common conditions such as UTIs and premature ejaculation. Their mission is to help coupled-up listeners have more fulfilling sex – and to transform nonexistent or perfunctory sexual experiences into something physically pleasurable, emotionally empowering and spiritually uplifting. From there, they believe, the sky is the limit: “elevated” sex can lead to better mental and physical health, and even a better career. After all, it’s what happened to them. As they tell their listeners, their relationship started out “hot and heavy”, before “the sex died”, says Haynes. But rather than “living out the rest of our days like that”, they decided to invest in their sex life. It became a project that they worked on together, drawing influences from yoga and books on everything from diet and anatomy to politics and memoir. The project eventually transformed their relationship and led them to start their own business, which offers private coaching, online courses and even retreats. Haynes focuses on women – and extends their relationship work to include pregnancy – while Talbot takes care of the men. They do it all from their idyllic home in Sussex, while juggling the parenting of their two home-schooled children. Their work couldn’t have come at a better time. Despite living in an age of hypersexualisation, with more Britons tuning in to Pornhub than BBC News, people across all demographics are having less sex than 10 years earlier, according to a 2019 survey published in the British Medical Journal, which also found that couples and over-25s are seeing the biggest decline. According to Relate, 29% of couples regard their relationships as “sexless” – and half of women and nearly two-thirds of men in the BMJ survey said they wanted to have more. Throw into that a pandemic in which 78% of cohabiting couples saw a change in their sexual activity (and not for the better), and it’s perhaps no wonder that Haynes and Talbot have found a listenership. But with devotees come detractors, and, as I’ll find out, some of the pair’s more controversial views have attracted criticism. Over tea in the kitchen, I listen to them lovingly bicker over how to heat pastries and I enjoy Haynes’ impressions of her kids pleading to stay up late. There is nothing about this conversation that suggests sex, but I don’t doubt it could go that way. That is, after all, one of their key messages: that too many couples wait for the vague and mysterious “mood” to show up, when it is always within their power to have sex, be it before work, once the kids are in bed, or just after a mid-morning croissant on an unseasonably warm autumn Thursday. Haynes and Talbot didn’t mean to record themselves having sex; it just sort of happened. “We intended to have sex off the podcast, and then come and talk about it,” says Talbot. But that first recording in April 2021 – dreamed up just a few months earlier – “developed its own momentum”, says Haynes, as the talk about sex turned easily to foreplay and then the act itself. Their approach to the podcast’s sex segments is to talk through what they’re doing and how it feels in unflinching detail. Their choice of words ranges from the ethereal (“I see your light shining,” one of them might say as they revel in each other’s “energy” and “aura”), to terms ordinarily censored: “Lacey is tugging on my cock,” Talbot might say; or from Haynes: “He’s licking my side pussy.” It is not a podcast to be listened to in public. The listener hears them pant, moan and direct each other to orgasm. In many ways we are living in the age of the overshare, where giving too much information turns ordinary people into viral stars. Indeed, a quick look at the podcast charts makes clear that subjects that were once highly personal (psychotherapy, pregnancy and sex) are driving serious engagement. But even by today’s standard, Lacey and Flynn Have Sex shocks. Not every episode ends in ecstasy, however. The listener also hears Haynes in distress when sex triggers difficult memories; flashes of annoyance if one does something the other doesn’t like; and the sound of shuffling around when there’s physical discomfort. All of it is discussed in detail: a real-life, authentic example of how to talk about (and throughout) sex. The couple met in Berlin more than 10 years ago, when Talbot, then working as a light artist, kept failing to show up for classes at Haynes’ yoga studio. “Then she had a Christmas party and I went to that,” recalls Talbot. Was it love at first sight? “No. My first thought was, ‘Wow, she is super Canadian. And loud. Imagine living with her,’” he laughs. Nonetheless, there was an instant connection. “I was actually in a relationship,” says Haynes. “And I could have kept going in it and just ignored the 15% of the relationship I wasn’t happy in, like so many people do. But then I met Flynn. I was just so fascinated by him. He recognised my entrepreneurial spirit and I his. And he was tall. As Melissa McCarthy says in Bridesmaids, I wanted to climb him like a tree.” For the next few years, they were sexually insatiable and madly in love, maintaining the passion through moves from Berlin to Australia via South Africa, before marrying in Nova Scotia and settling in the UK in 2014. It was around this time that their sex life slowed down, worsening after they had their first child in 2017. The issue? Talbot wanted more sex than Haynes. One person wanting more sex than the other is a common problem for couples in long-term relationships. “I was just like, everything I want is with Lacey,” says Talbot, recalling his frustration. “So why can’t we cultivate that?” “I felt resentment,” says Haynes. “I’d satisfy him and be like, ‘Phew, I’m off the hook for two weeks.’ It put Flynn in something we call the rejection loop, where he’d come near me and get rejected.” The transformation was not an easy process. “Lacey was full-on crying, having emotional meltdowns,” recalls Talbot. But every Sunday they made an appointment for sex and pancakes. This was the first step. “Credit to Lacey, she showed up,” he says. The pair say they have learned that sex is not just a pleasurable experience, but a place to work through emotions and traumas. In an episode on “rage fucking”, they talk about the opportunity to release feelings of anger through sex and masturbation. They even talk about sex as a place where they have some of their brightest business ideas. (Haynes even used to offer “pussy-powered” business coaching, which used their practice to help women unlock career goals.) Listeners will note their vernacular: an amalgam of new-age language, pop culture references and most of all the sort of “therapy speak” that dominates online self-care content. Did they try therapy? Would they have considered marriage counselling? “Honestly, no,” says Haynes. “I didn’t think someone would have had the depth of understanding that I wanted, to take me on an intuitive journey that would fulfil my healing. That was something I needed to do myself, and with Flynn.” Talbot says that a key job for men in sexual relationships is providing emotional safety. “I didn’t have an emotional barrier that was stopping me from performing and enjoying sex, though I have learned I have other areas I can work on,” he says. “But I wanted to make Lacey feel safe to explore, because I’m a leader – I’m an all-or-nothing guy. I’m married and I want to have amazing sex with Lacey. I was willing to do whatever it took.” Did they ever worry that the other one would leave if it got too much? No, they reply confidently. “We know some couples don’t have that level of security,” says Haynes. “And we never advise people to do what we did if they’re not in a safe situation.” In the end, it paid off. While they were trying to get back to that great sex, they discovered something even better. Haynes says that when she looks back on their early sex life, she sees that pain during intercourse was normalised. But now, she says, having learned to fully de-stress and release any tension in the mind, body and spirit, penetrative sex is pain-free. In her “pussy-gazing” class, which is currently offered as an online workshop, Haynes teaches women to put a mirror between their legs and work through any feelings of shame over their vulva. The class originally took her to festivals around the UK, as the pair became tuned into the unmet demand for coaching in intimate subjects. “We were like: if we were brave, what would really help people?” says Talbot. The podcast was born. Since then, their listenership has been steadily growing, finding listeners in 50 countries to the tune of 40,000 downloads. While they haven’t told their pensioner neighbour what they’re up to at home (“I think he’d have a heart attack,” says Talbot), their friends and family have been resoundingly supportive, even in their small, close-knit village. And both Haynes and Talbot say working on their business has strengthened their relationship. “We have conversations that we might not ordinarily have space for through this podcast,” says Haynes. “Love island” is just one of several locations in which Haynes and Talbot record themselves. In the recording studio that occupies their spare room, I wonder if the single mattress on the floor with the cheeky boob print duvet cover is another. It turns out that’s where Talbot sleeps when he works late or if Haynes is in the main bed with their children. For the recording today, the kids are with their nanny, and the plan is to make a talk-only episode. Haynes and Talbot take their seats opposite each other, almost knee to knee. I can tell that my presence, typing notes while they talk, is slightly disruptive (they say so on their podcast, kindly referring to me by my chosen fake name, Esmeralda), but they shake it off, and within minutes their eyes are only for each other. Watching them give each other edits, it’s clear not only how seriously they take their work but also how energised they are by one another. Is there something sexy about recording? “No, we don’t have a weird fetish where we want to expose ourselves, but only via sound,” laughs Talbot. They seem at ease, much more so than the nervous yet excited presenters I heard in episode one. But even back then they were wary of performing for the audience. (“It felt authentic and true, and now it feels performative,” says Talbot in the middle of the first episode’s sex, before getting the session back on track.) Haynes says that the performance of sex is something she’s been “unpicking” for a while. “There is playing into voyeurism – wanting to be seen and wearing a mask, often to satisfy another’s gaze. And that’s different from just being witnessed in your vulnerability and truth. I never want to be masked in my relationship, in my life or in this podcast,” says Haynes. This is my biggest takeaway from listening to their podcast: how much work and self-awareness is required to push performance away from sexual encounters, even between partners, even in private. It gives rise to the questions: what roles are we performing and where did we learn them? I’m reminded of a conversation I had with feminist scholar Gail Dines some years ago. She argued that sex is like eating, in that we have a biological urge for it. But how we eat – whether it’s with chopsticks or cutlery, sitting on the floor or at a table – is down to cultural influences. So what has culture shown us about how to have sex? Have we learned from Hollywood movies? The unrealistic and often degrading world of online porn? Clinical sex education classes focused on avoiding pregnancy? Tall tales from high school boys or the mumbled bumps heard through a university bedroom wall? Lacey and Flynn Have Sex may not be for everyone, but at the very least its offer of a different source is helpful. Undoubtedly, some will be put off by their grandiose terms – they refer to themselves as visionaries – or uncensored language. Their response on the podcast has been to ask listeners not to overlook their whole message because of a few disagreeable words. Personally, I’d say the same logic applies to other parts of their work, where it gets too new age, or simply too much. For example, I can appreciate the anatomical similarities between the vocal cords and the vagina. But when they mention this on the podcast in relation to women being vocally expressive during sex, my alarm bells ring. I ask Haynes and Talbot why they talk about the masculine and the feminine as archetypes. “I’m really talking about energies,” says Haynes, moving her index and middle finger against each other, to convey connected yet different halves. “So like day and night, sun and moon. If you relate more to the feminine or masculine, you have different styles of communication, and problem-solving.” But, she explains, that doesn’t mean you need to look a certain way to relate to that energy, or even be biologically ascribed to it. As for inclusivity, the pair say they have resigned themselves to not being able to fully deliver on that, and are coming to terms with their work being limited to – or at least most suitable for – heterosexual couples. They recall a non-binary person attending one of their in-person workshops, and as the group separated into masculine and feminine spaces to work with Haynes and Talbot separately, this person wasn’t sure where to go. “I spoke to the person after they said they didn’t always feel safe at the course,” says Haynes. “It really helped us understand that there’s a limit to how inclusive we can be,” Talbot says. “I get messages from people who tell me I’m a Terf [trans-exclusionary radical feminist] because I talk about ‘power’ and ‘feminine’, and then I’ll get a message from a trans woman saying my pussy-gazing workshop completely helped her connect after getting her new vagina,” says Haynes, sounding exasperated. “I want to live in a world where I can say, ‘This class will help these sorts of people, and if that’s not you, we love you, but this class won’t help.’ It doesn’t mean I’m trying to take away from other people and that I love them any less. I don’t think that their experience and who they are is any less valid.” Of the two, it’s clear that Haynes has borne the brunt of criticism. She certainly has unconventional views: after she gave an interview to the Guardian about free birthing, commenters argued that it was dangerous, irresponsible and smacked of middle-class privilege to refuse the help that women around the world are desperate for. More recently, Haynes announced on social media that she hasn’t had a Covid vaccination. I didn’t know this when we met, but when I follow up with the pair to discuss it over video chat, they’re uneasy, concerned that all their work will be reduced to this one position. Later they send me an email: “The same characteristic that makes us able to have sex on a podcast and freebirth both our children is the one that has us challenging the status quo in other realms. This might make our decisions unpopular or challenging for others to understand, but ultimately, we’re most concerned with being true to ourselves and what we feel is right. Our podcast is about governing your own body and living your own life. And we take that stance across every facet of life.” I want to ask the pair about money. I have, for many years, been concerned about the self-help and wellness space, and whether it is morally right to suggest individuals can transform their lives if they just do this, eat that, or think such and such. Isn’t it charging people for a false promise? And doesn’t it imply that the problems and traumas people experience – which are so frequently related to societal unfairness and injustice – are somehow the individual’s fault for not making the right choices, leaning in enough or harnessing their “power”? Wouldn’t it be more honest to say: self-help is a sticking plaster that may help you cope with a messed-up world, but it cannot cure the sickness? I expect defensiveness, but instead they listen thoughtfully before Talbot muses aloud: “In that regard maybe our work is a sticking plaster … ” “No,” Haynes interjects. “We’re a chisel. We’re giving you a little hammer and a nail to start picking it all apart. I don’t want people to cover it up. I want them to dig deeper.” I’m curious about the troubles straight men face with sex. “The majority of men are lost in the bedroom. They know how to penetrate but they don’t know how to connect,” says Talbot. “Men have, for generations, been conditioned to suppress their emotions. And yet truly expressed emotions and vulnerability are the route to a deep connection with women. “Not knowing how to harness the power of expression puts men at a great disadvantage, in and out of the bedroom. It’s why many men live with deep frustration and anger that’s close to the surface every day.” What about pornography? Surely that is a factor? In a recent episode, Talbot describes having been free of his semi-regular cam girl habit for six months. Is giving up porn something he’d recommend to others? “Yes, because it’s just perpetuating the cycle of needing visual stimulation when you should be creating a deeper understanding of your own pleasure. And then when you come to have pleasure with someone else, it’s going to be much greater.” As we wrap up, Talbot tells me a story about one of his clients. “I often give people homework to explore themselves – not just masturbating, but feeling yourself, rubbing your body, learning your own pleasure.” As part of this work, the client learned techniques on how not to climax, but hover near. He was enjoying having his control and the sensation. “And two weeks ago he told me he had an orgasm, and it was the greatest one of his life. Ever since, he’d cut off porn.” Without thinking, I let out a high-pitched “Yay!” “Good for him!” I cry, clapping. It is odd to feel so genuinely happy for the sex life of a man I have never met. “Isn’t it nice to change the narrative about men enjoying themselves?” asks Haynes. On the drive home, I feel strangely light. I don’t agree with everything Haynes and Talbot have to say, but it is hard to deny their bravery in putting themselves out there week after week, and the value of offering up a different model of fulfilling sex. And it’s a model that is, at its heart, fighting for something quite traditional: committed monogamy, happy families, love. “How very normie,” I think, surprised by just how sexy being a normie can be. 1. Communication is keyBefore achieving soulful and carefree sex that involves communicating with nonverbal cues, you need to get comfortable with saying if something is a turn-on, a turn-off, triggering or painful. 2. Don’t take it personally …… if you’re playing with your partner and they don’t enjoy it, say, “Sorry, someone else found that enjoyable. What do you find enjoyable?” Haynes says. Talbot says men need to know that “talking about sex doesn’t make you a bad lover”. 3. Discuss your sexual pastOften, current sexual issues are a result of past experiences, traumas or narratives. 4. Use more of your bodyRather than just jackhammering away, with all movement coming from the hips, Talbot suggests connecting torsos and hearts. “Be like two serpents writhing together.” Use controlled breathing to slow the rushes of feeling and prolong the experience, moving focus to other parts of your body. 5. Rewrite your power scriptHaynes says that the narrative where the man holds all the power may contribute to women’s dissatisfaction with penetrative sex. But there is power in letting go and allowing someone in, emotionally and physically. That’s what soulful sex is all about.
