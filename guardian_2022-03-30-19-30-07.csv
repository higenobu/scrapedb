3/30/2022,"Good morning. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has dismissed Russia’s pledge to drastically cut back its military activity in northern Ukraine, saying “Ukrainians are not naive people” and vowing to continue defensive military efforts. Zelenskiy said in a video address early on Wednesday: “Ukrainians have already learned during these 34 days of invasion and over the past eight years of the war in Donbas that only a concrete result can be trusted.” Russia’s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, said after talks in Istanbul on Tuesday that Moscow wanted to “increase mutual trust, create the right conditions for future negotiations and reach the final aim of signing a peace deal with Ukraine”, and that the Kremlin would “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv”. Ukraine’s president said that while there had been “positive” signals from the latest talks, “they do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells”. Has Russia halted attacks as promised? The mayor of Chernihiv, Vladyslav Atroshenko, said the Russians had lied and were continuing to indiscriminately attack the encircled city, which is less than 100 miles north of the country’s capital. Why is Abramovich playing peacemaker after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine? The emergence of the publicity-shy oligarch at the heart of peace negotiations has surprised many. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 35 of the Russian invasion. The House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol is reportedly looking at a “possible cover-up” of White House records focusing on Donald Trump’s phone logs from that fateful day, which bear an unexplained gap of seven hours and 37 minutes covering the period when the violence was unfolding. Documents obtained by the Washington Post and CBS News put flesh on the bones of one of the great mysteries of January 6: why White House phone logs contain holes in the record despite evidence the then president busily made calls at the height of the insurrection. The documents reveal that Trump’s diary shows an entry at 11.17am when he “talked on a phone call to an unidentified person”. The next entry is not until 6.54pm – 457 minutes later – when Trump asked the White House switchboard to place a call to his communications chief, Dan Scavino. Between those times Trump addressed a rally on the Ellipse, exhorting supporters to “fight like hell”; hundreds of Trump followers overran police barricades and stormed the Capitol building. What did the Washington Post journalists say? Bob Woodward (of Watergate fame) and Robert Costa reported that the long gap between call logs was of “intense interest” to elements of the January 6 committee. They quoted an unnamed member of the panel who said they were investigating a “possible cover-up”. The first federal legislation making lynching a hate crime, addressing a history of racist killings in the United States, became law yesterday. The bill, passed by the Senate this month, is named afte Emmett Till, the 14-year-old Black boy who was brutally murdered in Mississippi in 1955. Joe Biden signed the bill surrounded by Kamala Harris, members of Congress and top justice department officials. He was also joined by a descendant of Ida B Wells, a Black journalist who reported on lynchings, and Rev Wheeler Parker, a cousin of Till. The bill makes it possible to prosecute as a lynching any conspiracy to commit a hate crime that results in death or serious bodily injury. According to the bill’s champion, the Illinois congressman Bobby Rush, the law lays out a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and fines. Why has it taken this long to bring in? Congress first considered anti-lynching legislation more than 120 years ago. Until March of this year, it had failed to pass such legislation nearly 200 times. What did the vice-president say? “Lynching is not a relic of the past. Racial acts of terror still occur in our nation. And when they do, we must all have the courage to name them and hold the perpetrators to account,” she said. Jada Pinkett Smith promoted healing in an Instagram post on Tuesday, her first public comment since her husband slapped the comedian Chris Rock at this year’s Academy Awards ceremony. In an Instagram post yesterday, Pinkett Smith said: “This is a season for healing. And I’m here for it.” Israeli paramedics have said at least five people were killed in a shooting attack in a Tel Aviv suburb, the third such incident in less than a week. Amateur video broadcast on Israeli television stations showed a man dressed in black and pointing an assault rifle walking down a street in Bnei Brak. California’s first-in-the-nation taskforce on reparations for African Americans has voted to direct state compensation to the descendants of enslaved and free Black people who were in the US in the 19th century. Basing compensation on lineage would have the best change of surviving a legal challenge, they said. Police in Canada have laid a new charge against a “devil priest” hiding in France amid allegations he sexually abused multiple Inuit children. The case against Johannes Rivoire received renewed focus this week when Canada’s Inuit leader requested the pope personally intervene during a visit to the Vatican. Cathay Pacific is planning the world’s longest passenger flight by rerouting its New York to Hong Kong service over the Atlantic instead of the Pacific, the airline has said, in a new path that steers clear of Russia. The flight path will cover “just under 9,000 nautical miles” (16,668km, or 10,357 miles) in 16 to 17 hours, Cathay said in a statement to Agence France-Presse. The airline declined to be drawn on the reasons for its flight path giving a wide berth to Russia’s airspace, according to Bloomberg.

3/30/2022,"Everyone across Bryon shire went to bed Tuesday night thinking they were going to be fine, Mark Swivel says. “But people awoke in Byron to see the town centre flooded and shops underwater,” the councillor and lawyer said on Wednesday. “They were thinking, ‘well, what the hell has happened here?’” That question is being repeated across the nation, since people saw images of flood water inundating the tourist destination at levels not seen in living memory. It still has the capacity to shock many in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, even after weeks of flooding that has taken and upended lives across huge swathes of New South Wales and Queensland. Somehow, the thought of their favourite summer playground being underwater seemed unthinkable, right until it happened. For many in Byron, they know they live in a flood-prone area but were seemingly unaware of the danger they faced. On Tuesday night, after waiting out most of the pandemic to do so, John Mitchell and Karen Martin hosted their first event in two years, with bird expert Gisela Kaplan giving a talk and a book signing at their Byron Bay bookshop. Despite days of rain and the last-minute arrangements, the event sold out. “Since the big rain we had four weeks ago, there was a real sense of the town coming out of itself – a sense of: ‘let’s go out and have some fun’,” Mitchell says. Swivel says there was sense it was going to be “a wet and tricky” night, but there would “be no real drama”. He was hosting a dinner party – a nice, relaxing get-together. Then he drove a friend home at about 10.30pm. “As the night went on, the rain got more intense, and people started to feel that something was awry,” he says. “You could literally sense it.” Between midnight and 1am, the reports started coming through on social media. “Suffolk Park, where it rarely floods, if at all, you’ve got people standing in lounge rooms knee deep in water,” he says. “In Bangalow you’ve got cars lost with flooding that no one was expecting.” On the 2am news bulletin, Swivel says, “Byron doesn’t even rate a mention.” Swivel speaks of anger and frustration about the emergency warnings. He says they did not come until after the emergency, and the forecasts were not accurate. “There is real anger in the community – and it is constructive anger,” he says. “What we are really looking at is the under-resourcing of services that the public should be able to rely on in a crisis. “There has to be a limit to accepting what we experience.” Martin says it is an anger that had been bubbling away for the last two years in a town that feels abandoned by a Sydney-centric state government. Mitchell’s anger is directed at all levels of government and their failure to prepare for seasonal disasters that are only becoming more frequent and intense due to the climate emergency, but which are far older than the town itself. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We can keep focusing on the awfulness and the tragedy – or we can start to understand what is actually happening here,” he says. This is a message echoed by the town’s former mayor, Simon Richardson, who says Byron is a “living example of poor planning 100 years ago”. “It’s actually below the waterline in a wetlands – you wouldn’t build a town there now for quids,” he says. “The water gets captured in Byron like in a wok.” Richardson stood down in 2021 after nine years as mayor and 13 years on a council which he says his rebuilt roads lost to landslides that they knew would not stand up to the next big downpour. “We fixed those roads knowing they were going to fail again,” he says, “because we wouldn’t have been funded by the state government if we improved the roads and made them more resilient.” Yet, if their infrastructure of failed them, the people of Bryon proved resilient. When Annick Muylle’s clothing store in Fletcher Street went under, so too did hundreds of thousands of dollars of carefully chosen clothing. So the Belgium born shopkeeper went for a stroll around her flooded town. “The bakery was open, babies were in prams, people were walking their dogs,” she says. “I thought: ‘this is so Australian, to get on with life’.” “After so much rain, and such a long night, to go: ‘OK let’s just walk the dog, or have a coffee, or put the baby in pram have a walk around – that was something positive.”",News/Australia news,Paradise under water: the floods that caught Byron Bay off guard,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/paradise-under-water-the-floods-that-caught-byron-bay-off-guard
3/30/2022,"Whoever writes Sadio Mané’s scripts has been on form lately. For the second time in eight weeks, the Liverpool forward found himself with the chance to seal victory for Senegal against Egypt in a penalty shootout, although this time rather than being crowned African champions, it was for a place at the World Cup. There had been an air of inevitability about the whole evening after Boulaye Dia’s effort deflected in off Hamdi Fathi in the fourth minute at the new Diamniadio Olympic Stadium in Dakar, which was packed with a capacity 50,000 crowd hours before kick-off. That early goal cancelled out Egypt’s 1-0 advantage from the first leg and Ismaïla Sarr had the chance to ease Senegal’s path to qualification long before the drama of the shootout, only for the Watford forward to miss a relatively straightforward opportunity. And what drama. A series of lasers had been directed at visiting players throughout the match but they seemed to multiply as Mohamed Salah stepped up to take Egypt’s first penalty after Kalidou Koulibaly had missed the opener for Senegal. Mané’s Anfield teammate, who didn’t even get the chance to take a penalty in the Afcon final as he was down as the Pharaohs’ fifth taker, stepped up and saw his attempt clear the crossbar by several feet to the delight of the home supporters. It was only when Sarr dispatched the fifth penalty of the shootout that the deadlock was finally broken, before Mostafa Mohamed’s effort was saved by Édouard Mendy to present Mané with the opportunity to seal Senegal’s third qualification for the World Cup. “The game is over. Everything is over,” said Egypt’s head coach, Carlos Quieroz afterwards. “I have not much to say but words of gratitude to the players.” He was surprisingly calm but the Egypt Football Association is expected to lodge an official complaint to Fifa over the lasers, insisting they affected the vision of their players, Salah especially, during the shootout. Egypt’s defeat was not the only hard luck story for north Africa. At one stage it seemed that four could be on their way to Qatar until a dramatic finale to the tie between Algeria and Cameroon that saw Karl Toko Ekambi score in the fourth minute of injury time at the end of extra time to send the Indomitable Lions through on away goals. Algeria’s heartache was compounded by the fact Ahmed Touba’s late goal, making it 2-1 on aggregate, had looked like being enough for Djamel Belmadi’s side. Elsewhere, there was no such fairytale for Mali, who were the only African side in the final round of qualifying who had never previously made it to a World Cup finals. They found Tunisia too much in the end, unable to find the net in a goalless second leg after losing last Friday’s first 1-0 in Bamako. The Carthage Eagles have now made it to six World Cups but are yet to get past the group stages despite being the first African team to win a match at the finals when they defeated Mexico in 1978. Morocco, who in 1986 became the first African team to reach the knockout stages, sailed past Democratic Republic of Congo 5-2 on aggregate and, along with Senegal, look best equipped to at least match that achievement in Qatar. Russia 2018 was the first time since the 1982 tournament that no African sides made it out of their group, with Aliou Cissé’s side no doubt desperate to emulate the class of 2002 by reaching the quarter-finals again and perhaps going where no African team has ventured before: the last four. Ghana came closest to achieving that feat in 2010 when they were a Luis Suárez handball away from defeating Uruguay in the quarter-finals. The Black Stars are not the same force these days despite their away-goals victory over Nigeria. The Ghanaian president, Nana Akufo-Addo, summed it up best when he referenced their “their dogged display in Abuja” in a tweet celebrating their qualification via Thomas Partey’s away goal, going on to say “they have made the entire nation proud” after the embarrassment of crashing out in the group stages at the Cup of Nations earlier this year. Ivory Coast’s hopes of being in Qatar were dashed last year when they lost 1-0 to Cameroon in Doula, a match Wilfried Zaha missed after asking not to be called up. While the Crystal Palace forward later backtracked on the suggestion he was ready to retire from international football, and was subsequently part of the squad that lost on penalties to Egypt in the Afcon last-16 of the African Cup of Nations, he would have been disappointed to be denied the chance to face England at Wembley on Tuesday night after being ruled out with a suspected grade 2 hamstring injury. His two appearances for England in 2012 and 2013 came at a time when Les Elephants were one of Africa’s most formidable sides, with the likes of Yaya Touré and Salomon Kalou helping them to win the 2015 Afcon title under Hervé Renard. Zaha’s decision to switch allegiances a year later coincided with a downturn in performances and results that Pascal Beaumelle – a former assistant to Renard – has been desperately trying to turn around. The Frenchman admitted before Tuesday’s friendly that Palace’s Abidjan-born defender Marc Guéhi had been in his sights before his England call-up and, on the evidence of their disjointed performance in the 3-0 defeat at Wembley, several more reinforcements will be needed before they can compete at the top level again.",Sport/Football,Mané’s laser-guided penalty lights up Africa’s day of World Cup joy and pain | Ed Aarons,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/30/sadio-mane-penalty-africa-day-of-world-cup-qualifying-joy-and-pain-senegal-egypt
3/30/2022,"Sir Ian McKellen is to play Hamlet for the third time in his career in a production this summer at the Edinburgh fringe. McKellen, who first took on the role in 1971 and starred last year in an “age-blind” staging in Windsor, will this time share the part with the Danish dancer Johan Christensen. The pair will perform with members of the Edinburgh Festival Ballet in the 75-minute production directed and choreographed by Peter Schaufuss and billed as a “new performance concept”. McKellen said that, at a crucial moment in the play: “Shakespeare describes in detail a dance, performed by the actors touring through Elsinore. Hamlet says: ‘What a piece of work is a man... how infinite in faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable in action.’ The same could be said of Peter Schaufuss and his company of wonderful dancers. It’s inspiring to watch them and work with them.” Christensen has previously danced the role of Hamlet in a performance featuring audio recordings of John Gielgud as the title character. The new show – which also features Luke Schaufuss, the director’s son, and British dancer Stefan Wise – will run for almost the entire month of August. It will be staged at the new 400-seat Ashton Hall, named after the choreographer Frederick Ashton, at St Stephen’s theatre, formerly St Stephen’s church. McKellen has performed at the Edinburgh festival several times, including as Richard II and Edward II with Prospect theatre company in 1969. The actor recently declared himself ready for a new challenge while talking to Radio 4’s Today programme. McKellen said he had never had a list of parts he wanted to play but he was still working his way through different types of theatre production. “There are a few left – one would be the musical,” he explained.",Arts/Stage,Ian McKellen to play Hamlet at the Edinburgh fringe,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/30/ian-mckellen-hamlet-edinburgh-fringe
3/30/2022,"Two days on from Will Smith slapping presenter Chris Rock at the 94th Academy Awards, following a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Hollywood appears united in feeling Smith deserves substantial reprimand for his actions. One of the three hosts for this year’s ceremony, Amy Schumer, has said she is still “triggered and traumatised” by the incident, and “waiting for this sickening feeling to go away from what we all witnessed”. Writing on Instagram, Schumer added: “I love my friend [Chris Rock] and believe he handled it like a pro. Stayed up there and gave an Oscar to his friend [Questlove] and the whole thing was so disturbing. “So much pain in [Will Smith], anyway I’m still in shock and stunned and sad.” On Monday, Smith posted a public apology to Rock on social media, saying: “I am a work in progress.” This followed his qualified apology in his best actor acceptance speech later on Sunday night, defending his actions by saying “love makes you do crazy things”. The Academy has said it will conduct a formal review of the incident, which will last “a few weeks” and following which it will take “appropriate action”. Rock is yet to publicly respond to the incident, but is not pressing charges. Ticket sales for his forthcoming tour have spiked in the wake of Sunday night, with one marketplace site saying it sold more tickets to Rock’s tour in the night following the Oscars than it did in the entire month preceding. The price for the cheapest seats on the upcoming US and UK tour rose by about 800%. Speaking on US TV on Tuesday, Jim Carrey said that had he been in Rock’s position on Sunday, he would have sued Smith for $200m, and that Smith should have been arrested. The standing ovation which met Smith’s best actor award later the same evening left Carrey feeling “sickened”, he said. “Hollywood is just spineless en masse and it really felt like this is a really clear indication that we aren’t the cool club any more.” The host, Gayle King, further speculated: “If anyone else had walked from the audience and done that, they would’ve been escorted out by security or maybe even arrested.” Others who have come forward with their opinions on the incident over the past 24 hours include Isla Fisher, who posted a photograph of her husband, Sacha Baron Cohen, alongside Rock, with a love heart, and OJ Simpson, who said he thought Smith was “wrong” but that he could “understand the sentiment”.",Arts/Film,Amy Schumer ‘triggered and traumatised’ by Will Smith Oscars slap incident,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/30/will-smith-oscars-slap-chris-rock-academy-announces-review-amy-schumer-triggered
3/30/2022,"People on TikTok are obsessed with facial symmetry, which means, per the laws of the algorithm, I am too. I started playing with symmetry filters in 2020. The first one I tried, Inverted, doesn’t tweak your features like other filters, it simply reverses the image of your face. It quickly became popular as a quasi-litmus test for beauty: if your face looked the same both ways, the thinking went, you were beautiful. Only a rare few passed, and everyone else was melting down. I watched video after video of people flipping their faces back and forth, panic emerging at the inconsistencies. When I tried myself, the results were unsettling. Every time the camera flipped, my nose seemed to dance in the opposite direction, my jawline moving up and down in time. I first heard the idea that symmetrical faces were more beautiful than non-symmetrical faces when I was very young, and I believed it without question. But this was the late 90s, and I was too busy trying to grow boobs by chugging milk to be neurotic about my face. Plus, I didn’t have the proper tools to investigate my features back then. It wasn’t until college that I became convinced I had a “good” side and a “bad” side – and it isn’t a coincidence that this happened when Facebook became ubiquitous. This was the era of the party album. Every time my friends and I went out, we dedicated at least 15 minutes to lining up for each other’s digital cameras. As soon as I realized that I preferred the photos when I was standing on the right side of the line, I studied my face in the mirror to try to understand why. I could never find the reason, which irritated me, since the evidence was right there in my Facebook tags. Never mind that my friends claimed they had bad sides, too, but looking at the photos, I could never see their differences either. As with all insecurities, mine were true and theirs were not. Ten years later, I got the opportunity to try out a True Mirror for a story. The True Mirror is a mirrored contraption housed in a black box that, through some trickery, presents your face to you in reverse – the way people see you in real life. According to the marketing, looking into a True Mirror is like meeting yourself for the first time; the tagline is, unsubtly: “See how you really are!” More accurately, see how lopsided you really are. When it arrived, everyone at the office looked into it with horror. Eyebrows cocked, cheeks drooped, lips involuntarily smirked. Nobody could bear to look (or look away). We believed that what we were seeing was finally “the truth” about our faces, and yet everyone was convinced they looked crooked and absurd, a collection of Picasso-like features that no one else could corroborate. So was it the truth, really? The True Mirror and TikTok symmetry filters both promise a new level of self-awareness and instead deliver anxiety. The Inverted filter faded from popularity last year, but new versions arrive all the time: the Mirror filter, the Twins filter and, the apex of them all, the Symmetry filter, which seamlessly shows you what your face would look like if it were left-symmetrical, and when you tap the screen, right-symmetrical. The effect for most people is that one of the faces is more conventionally attractive than the other, which looks a little strange or “off” (but of course, ironically, is also symmetrical). You might think I’m overstating the prominence of this preoccupation. TikTok is so vast, yet so personalized, that even a microtrend can seem universal, but this one has genuine reach: there are more than 100m TikToks with the tag #symmetricalface, and when I asked my Instagram followers if their feeds included people discussing facial symmetry, about 70% of 4,000-plus respondents said yes. No one can deny that TikTok invites a certain fixation with objectifying the self for the self. Filters can show you how old you look, your “true” eye color, which celebrity you most closely resemble, or “what you’d look like if you were a 90s kid”. There is a searching quality to a lot of the content – probably related to the fact that 60% of users are under 24 – as if people are logging on to find themselves. Symmetry as an important beauty metric plays right into this. Of course I believed it, too, but it became clear to me as I watched people freak out over their asymmetry collectively that the fixation was absurd and misguided. Perfectly symmetrical faces look unnerving. Perfection, aesthetically, is boring almost by definition. There may be studies that show humans are drawn to symmetrical faces, but there are also studies that show the opposite. “If you create a perfectly symmetrical face in the lab, which is what I’ve done, those faces have very low beauty ratings,” Dahlia W Zaidel, a UCLA psychology professor, told Stephanie Shapiro in a 2006 article about the beauty of asymmetry for the Chicago Tribune. “We never look at perfectly symmetrical faces, never from the minute we are born.” When we herald symmetry as somehow divine, we forget the appeal of the real and organic, like someone you can squeeze versus something you can only perceive, like Lil Miquela. Obviously symmetry is easier on the eyes initially, but have you ever fallen in love with a crooked tooth or the strange way someone’s face moved when they talked? People’s most compelling traits are imperfect and incidental – out of their control. “Nature and design have proven that wonky objects can have even more charm, power, and adaptability than their mirrored neighbors,” Dominic Muren, an industrial designer, told Shapiro. There’s a reason musicians often leave flaws in their songs, and designers typically work with balance, rather than perfect symmetry in mind. Eyes and ears scan perfection, then catch and linger on the unexpected. I understand why we want clear answers to subjective questions, like whether we’re likable or pleasant to look at. But the pursuit of perfection is wildly unsexy. Worse, it’s boring. Our desperation to codify and commodify beauty has led us down a path of sensual decrepitude, of obsession and anxiety. It has supplied us with some of the least interesting role models of all time. We aren’t meant to understand what makes us appealing to others, nor command it. Recently, I went to a Gang of Four show in Brooklyn and was blown away – not by the music, but by Jon King’s performance, which was like nothing I’d ever seen before. Completely lost in the moment, he jerked and jostled all over the stage, eyes shut tight, mouth twisted into an expression that would be humiliating if it weren’t utterly true to him. It was captivating from start to finish. I’ve never watched someone on stage be so engaged with the audience and yet uninterested in how it was perceiving him. It occurred to me afterward that his lack of interest in trying to control his image was exactly what made him singular and life-affirming to watch. Watching him reminded me what it feels like to love something uncontrived. To be intrigued by something unusual on a personal, almost private level. Maybe we don’t need to pursue such a tight grip over how everyone else sees us. Maybe beauty isn’t something one should “pursue” at all.

3/30/2022,"Police officers in America continue to kill people at an alarming rate, according to a data analysis that has raised concerns about the Biden administration’s push to expand police investments amid growing concerns about crime. Law enforcement in the US have killed 249 people this year as of 24 March, averaging about three deaths per day and mirroring the deadly force trends of recent years, according to Mapping Police Violence, a non-profit research group. The data, experts say, suggests in the nearly two years since George Floyd’s murder, the US has made little progress in preventing deaths at the hands of law enforcement, and that the 2020 promises of systemic reforms have fallen short. Police have killed roughly 1,100 people each year since 2013. In 2021, officers killed 1,136 people – one of the deadliest years on record, Mapping Police Violence reported. The organization tracks deaths recorded by police, governments and the media, including cases where people were fatally shot, beaten, restrained, and Tasered. The Washington Post has reported similar trends, and found that 2021 broke the record for fatal shootings by officers since the newspaper started its database tracking in 2015. “The shocking regularity of killings suggests that nothing substantive has really changed to disrupt the nationwide dynamic of police violence,” said Samuel Sinyangwe, a data scientist and policy analyst who founded Mapping Police Violence and Police Scorecard, which evaluates departments. “It demonstrates that we’re not doing enough, and if anything, it appears to be getting slightly worse year over year.” Advocates argue that the persistent rate of killings was a key reason why the US should not be expanding its police forces. Police killings are proceeding at almost exactly the same pace as previous years. No progress has been made in reducing deadly police violence nationwide. Another ~870 people will be killed by police by year’s end unless there are massive systemic changes. https://t.co/G3YiCYZoEi pic.twitter.com/bvhQvZJKWV Joe Biden, who has repeatedly said to “fund the police”, released a budget proposal earlier this week for $30bn in law enforcement and crime prevention efforts, including funding to put “more police officers on the beat”. The proposal, which called for the expansion of “accountable, community policing”, sparked immediate criticisms from racial justice groups. The Movement for Black Lives noted that the White House was only proposing $367m to support police reform and said Biden’s budget “shows a blatant disregard for his promises to Black people, masked as an effort to decrease crime”. Michael Gwin, a White House spokesperson, said in an email that Biden had been “consistent in his opposition to defunding the police and in his support for additional funding for community policing”, and “remains committed to advancing long-overdue police reforms”. “The president, along with the overwhelming majority of Americans, knows that we can and must have a criminal justice system that both protects public safety and upholds our founding ideals of equal treatment under the law. In fact, those two goals go hand-in-hand. That approach is at the core of the president’s comprehensive plan to combat crime by getting guns off the streets, and by investing in community-oriented policing and proven community anti-violence programs,” he added. During the national uprisings after Floyd’s murder, “defund the police” became a central rallying cry, with advocates arguing reform efforts had failed to prevent killings and misconduct. Cities could save lives by reducing police budgets, limiting potentially deadly encounters with civilians, and reinvesting funds into community programs that address root causes of crime, activists have said. Some cities initially responded with modest cuts to police budgets, in some cases removing officers from schools, traffic enforcement and other divisions, and investing in alternatives. But over the last year, an uptick in gun violence and homicides has prompted a backlash to the idea of defunding (even as the current crime rate remains significantly lower than decades prior). With intense media coverage of crime, officials have been pressured to abandon reforms, prioritize harsh punishments and invest more in police. Cities that made small cuts have largely restored and expanded law enforcement budgets. “To invest more into a system that we all know is broken is really a slap in the face to everyone who marched in summer 2020,” said Chris Harris, director of policy at the Austin Justice Coalition in Texas. “It reflects just a real lack of solutions to the problems that we face. It’s just more of the same – even if it’s exactly the thing that we know continues to hurt and kill people.” Harris said it was disappointing to see calls for police expansion at the federal level, given the George Floyd Act, the key national reform measure proposed after the protests, did not succeed. He said he was not surprised that the killings by police continue apace: “We fail to deal with the underlying issues that often drive police interactions in our communities, partly because we’re funding this law enforcement response rather than the upfront supports and services that could help people.” Gwin noted that the White House was exploring potential executive action to pass reforms after Republicans blocked negotiations over legislation. Sinyangwe pointed to a data analysis in Los Angeles, which showed that in recent years, one-third of incidents in which Los Angeles police department (LAPD) used force involved an unhoused person: “Instead of using force against homeless people, we should be investing in services and creating unarmed civilian responses to these issues.” But in LA, where housing and outreach efforts have fallen short, there has been an escalating law enforcement crackdown on street encampments. And LAPD is on track to get a large budget boost, despite a sharp increase in killings by officers in 2021. Proponents of police budget increases argue that law enforcement is the solution to violence, but Sinyangwe noted that fewer than 5% of arrests nationally are for serious violent crimes. And research has shown that when police forces expand, there are more arrests for low-level offenses, he said. And many high-profile killings by police have involved stops for alleged low-level crimes. Kaitlyn Dey, an organizer in Portland, Oregon, said it was frustrating to see officials push a narrative that cities need to “re-fund the police” when municipalities have largely failed to defund law enforcement in the first place. “We have to start chipping away at how many officers there are, what kind of equipment they have – that is going to reduce [police] violence, because they’re not going to be able to enact it if you take away their resources,” she said. There are documented solutions that could reduce killings, said Alex S Vitale, sociology professor at Brooklyn College and an expert on policing. He noted estimates suggesting that 25% to 50% of people killed by police were having a mental health crisis. “If we would develop non-police mental health crisis teams, and improve community-based mental health services, we could save hundreds of lives a year,” he said. Vitale, author of The End of Policing, pointed to a program in Denver that sends mental health clinicians and paramedics to respond to certain 911 calls, which is now dramatically expanding after a successful pilot. Health experts have responded to thousands of emergency calls since 2020, and have never had to call police for backup, the Denver Post reported. “While the media has mobilized crime panics to try and shut down talk of reducing our reliance on policing, organizations across the country are doing grassroots work in communities to demand these alternatives,” he said .",News/US news,‘No progress’ since George Floyd: US police killing three people a day,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/30/us-police-killing-people-high-rates
3/30/2022,"Richard Linklater is looking back from outer space at childhood’s blue remembered hills in this intensely enjoyable and sweet family movie for Netflix. It’s a rotoscope animation digitally based on live action; in its way, it is every bit as cultish and hallucinatory as the ones that Linklater has made before, like Waking Life from 2001 and A Scanner Darkly from 2006. A 10-year-old boy called Stan (voiced by Milo Coy and then by Jack Black as Stan’s adult self, narrating the action) is growing up in a Houston suburb in the late 60s in a big family with a dad employed in a lowly admin job at Nasa. Stan is obsessed (like everyone) with the Apollo 11 moon mission, and has a vivid fantasy or hallucination that he has been picked by Nasa agents to be a test astronaut for a top-secret dummy-run moon landing, codenamed Apollo 10½, for which the authorities accidentally built the lunar test module too small. So they need a kid of the highest calibre to pilot the thing down to the moon’s surface and bring it back home safely to reassure Neil, Buzz and Michael that they’ll be OK. With shrewd storytelling judgment, Linklater makes this lucid dream of unsung kid heroism only a very small part of what is otherwise an overwhelmingly real, almost novelistically low-key film: a basically plotless account of just what it was like to be a kid in Houston in the late 60s. It’s a nonstop madeleine-fest, a revival of memories curated with passionate connoisseurship, something to compare with Joe Brainard’s 1970 memoir I Remember: the ice-cream flavours, the TV shows, the drive-in movies, the schoolyard games, the parents, the eccentric grandparents, the theme park rides, the neighbours, the prank phone calls – and the fact that Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color was on Sunday night TV and so unfairly saturated with next-day school dread. There is also vehement praise for the 1950 movie Destination Moon, based on Robert Heinlein’s 1947 novel, for predicting almost everything about the Apollo missions. Stan’s is a very innocent childhood: he doesn’t have any crushes on anyone, and we don’t hear about anything of the sort for his older siblings. The one allusion to this issue comes when the Nasa agents show him the fake photos from the summer camp they’ve fabricated to explain his absence doing this secret mission – one shows him smiling at a girl. Nothing like that actually happens: the shy love story that another coming-of-age-type movie might have created in parallel with the spaceshot isn’t there. Stan’s actual romance is with the moon. And when the family gathers around the TV to watch the moon landing itself, real life merges ecstatically with Stan’s dream, and the rotoscope animation helps conceal the join. The film’s subtitle is A Space Age Childhood, an echo of his great, 12-year masterpiece Boyhood. Youth is a great theme of Linklater’s, but presented without any great directional moralising or emotional narrative. Being young just is. This is a film of enormous charm – it’s disappointing it’s not being shown on the big screen.

3/30/2022,"In 1903 a poem was published in the popular magazine Truth about the English cricket season: Sing a song of fixtures, of wickets never dry,Two and twenty cricketers with visages awry;Even when the rain stops play is not allowed;Isn’t that the sort of thing to rile a British crowd? The crowd waits in the beer-house, telling stories funny;The teams stay in the club-room, grudging loss of money;And so the county season swiftly ebbs and flows,Till up comes the autumn to bring it to a close. There’s nothing remotely funny about watching grass dry, a pastime frustrating enough to have triggered the inventive streak of generations of cricket lovers. On the anniversary of the first and so far as we can tell only trial of perhaps the most outlandish and ambitious solution of all, it seems as good a time as any to run through a few of their most memorable ideas. We start in the 1930s, perhaps the golden age of quick-drying gadgetry. In the second year of the decade the MCC experimented with “a large box-like arrangement with a powerful electric fan, that is run up and down the pitch on a small truck” and also featured “a tapering funnel”. The idea had been dreamed up by its clerk of works, RF Cotterell, and then pitched to the Sturtevant Engineering Company, “manufacturers of blowing and exhausting fans for all purposes”, who put together a prototype. “So great was the force of the air current that after 16 gallons of water had been poured on the pitch the moisture was entirely dissipated in half an hour,” it was reported. It created a hurricane of wind and of publicity, but little was heard of it thereafter. Presumably when it came to this idea the MCC was not, in the end, big fans. The following year, Surrey experimented with a newly patented drying roller. “Its application after rain will remove 75% of wetness from the top of the turf,” reported the Mirror, which would have been extremely promising were it not for what followed: “The new roller, however, will leave the pitch jet black.” The invention’s prospects, like the pitches it was used on, were never particularly bright. In 1932 the Illustrated News reported on “wholesale experiments throughout the country with absorbent rollers”, and in 1933 Bert Luttrell, the groundsman at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, created his own version. “Briefly stated, it consists of a machine like an ordinary roller, but with an absorbent surface instead of an iron one,” the Sporting Globe reported. “As the roller is pushed over the wet ground the rubber absorbs the water, while a wooden roller which presses tightly into it forces the water out of the rubber into a tank at the back.” Sadly, Luttrell’s contraption absorbed almost as much time as water, its inventor boasting that with a 6ft-wide version “the whole of the Melbourne ground could be practically cleaned of lying water in five or six hours”. A prototype was sent to a cricket-loving English entrepreneur, WB Thompson, who was so enthusiastic he promptly established the Absorbent Roller Company and convinced Aveling-Barford of Lincolnshire – manufacturer of 75% of Britain’s road rollers at the time – to produce them for him under the brand name Dryad. Inevitably, just as he was trying to establish his young business, in 1934, came one of the driest summers on record. Due to hosepipe bans when Thompson took the roller out for demonstrations, he also had to drive around a tank containing his family’s used bathwater, with which he would drench a patch of turf before soaking it up again and driving it to his next appointment. One day, Thompson heard it was raining while Somerset were supposed to be playing the touring Australians (my source has the rain falling in Taunton, but the game actually took place in Worcester), smelled an ideal opportunity to prove his machine’s worth, jumped in his Bentley and set off. When he arrived three hours later the ground was bathed in sunshine and play had already restarted. Luttrell also came up with another roller designed “for taking the first coating of fine soft mud off embryonic cricket pitches”, which Melbourne City Council later used to clean pavements, while at the time of his death in 1951 the MCG had three of his patented absorbent rollers still in active service. Two years later, the International Wool Secretariat backed a trial of “a revolving drum covered with thick wool felt” at the Sports Turf Research Institute in Yorkshire, which its inventors were too sheepish to further publicise. Away from rollers, in 1937 Yorkshire were reported to have “purchased a new apparatus consisting of a portable mangle and blankets that are put on to the wicket to absorb moisture”. In 1949 a Mr L Milner, former chief constable of Chesterfield police, produced “specially prepared mats made of a kind of cellulose sponge” – in fact they were made by Sponcel, the Kent-based company behind Spontex washing-up sponges, and were basically outsized versions of their domestic bestseller – touring the country demonstrating them to groundsmen and club officials. “The mats are laid on the wet ground, a board is placed over them, two men of outsize dimensions stand on the board … and the mats, rather like huge slices of surgical lint, soak the water into their systems,” the Bradford Observer reported. “I have a police pension, and haven’t put this scheme on the market to make money, but simply because I’ve loved the game all my life, and feel that my idea will be welcomed by thousands of other cricket-lovers,” Milner said. And then there was the solution dreamed up in 1954 by Geoff Howard, the secretary of Lancashire. “Hair driers used for women gave him an idea,” the Lancashire Evening Post reported, “which was whether the principle could be developed for drying pitches quickly.” He did what anyone would do in such circumstances and contacted Rolls-Royce, maker of luxury cars and aeroplane engines, and asked the company to help. It is fair to say that it was not immediately enthusiastic. “It will be a shockingly expensive thing to use a jet engine to dry ground,” an official told the Guardian. “Besides, it might well damage the turf. And the consumption of fuel would be between 350 and 400 gallons of paraffin an hour.” Howard dismissed their cost-based concerns. “The important thing to remember is that hundreds of people are left out of cricket grounds when rain interrupts play for long periods,” he said. “If you can get play restarted or resumed, you will be able to pay for the use of jets. If people can come and see cricket, it will not matter if the cost is £100 [around £3,000 now – ed].” WT Taylor, the secretary of Derbyshire – Rolls-Royce’s local club – loved the idea. “It is well known that the jet engine gives off hot air,” he said. “We shall just have to give it a trial.” With his encouragement, on 30 March Rolls-Royce’s chief research engineer, H Pearson, supervised as an RB.50 Trent engine, as used in the Glostor Meteor jet fighter, was strapped to a lorry while the local fire brigade trained hoses on one of Derbyshire’s practice pitches. Cyril Washbrook, the Lancashire captain, was among those present to witness the demonstration. “The lorry was driven up to a stretch of turf the fire brigade had flooded for us,” he wrote. “Judging that flooded turf by ordinary cricket standards, I would have said we wouldn’t have been able to play for two days. Yet after two bursts from the jet at half throttle – one of three minutes and another of five – all the water had gone. Given an hour of natural drying, or another short burst from the jet, it would have been fit for play. It was one of the most remarkable things I have ever seen.” Sadly very few other people got the chance, and unlike the Glostor Meteor this particular use of Rolls-Royce’s engines never really took off. Eventually even Howard and Taylor’s enthusiasm evaporated, which is precisely what rainwater has been left to do for most of their sport’s frustrating history.

3/30/2022,"The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has dissolved the national advisory body established less than two years ago to scrutinise major water projects. This came after an expert member of the body, Stuart Khan, expressed concern, in letters to other members, that the government’s funding announcements to build dams had been made for “brazenly political purposes” and without the advisory body having been given an opportunity to consider the proposals. There is no indication Joyce was aware of the letters or that they played any role in the decision. Guardian Australia revealed last week that the National Water Grid Advisory Body – established by Joyce’s predecessor, Michael McCormack – was not consulted before the announcement of $5.9bn in funding to build the Urannah and Hells Gates dams in north Queensland. Members of the expert advisory body were told Wednesday morning that the panel would now be disbanded. A spokesperson for Joyce said the body “was never intended to be ongoing and now is an appropriate time for it to conclude its work”. “The National Water Grid Advisory Body has met the objectives set for it when it was established in August 2020,” the spokesperson said. “The advisory body has provided independent advice to the government on water infrastructure, using the world’s best science to support the work of the National Water Grid Authority. This advice and the science underpinning it has helped inform the government’s decisions on water infrastructure projects.” The decision comes amid scrutiny of the government’s decision to fund several dam projects – including committing money to projects that lack detailed business cases – in Nationals seats in both New South Wales and Queensland. Guardian Australia has obtained letters sent by Stuart Khan, a University of NSW water engineering expert appointed to the body, to other members of the expert panel. In those letters, Khan outlines concerns about government commitments to fund several dam projects. These include the proposed Dungowan Dam and the Wyangala Dam wall raising in NSW, and the Urannah Dam in Queensland. Nationals MPs George Christensen and Michelle Landry – who represent bellwether Queensland electorates – have been openly campaigning for the Urannah Dam to be built. Joyce announced a $500m federal contribution for Urannah earlier this month. The proponent for the Uranah project last week said it had recently completed a detailed business case, although the Guardian understands it had not been seen by the advisory board. After the announcement, Khan wrote to the advisory body to outline concerns that they had not been consulted or sent a business case. “It is my strong opinion that the Australian government should wait for the outcomes of this significant public investment in the development of the detailed business case before committing public funds to the construction of the dam,” Khan said. “Responsible management of Australia’s water resources is of enormous importance in a country prone to extreme drought and extreme floods. “Water infrastructure investment decisions are far too important, with far too many consequences, to be used for brazenly political purposes in the lead-up to an election. “It is apparent that the Commonwealth commitment to funding it is being used as a device intended to extract political benefit.” Guardian Australia has previously reported that Dungowan has no business case or environmental approval, and has already doubled in cost; the Wyangala dam wall raising have also been hit by a massive cost blowout. In a letter from August last year, Khan said he had concerns regarding the planning for the NSW projects; he said the advisory body should oppose any additional federal government contributions to cover cost increases for Dungowan or Wyangala, until business cases could be properly scrutinised. “While these may all prove to be worthy investments of public funds, there are several current public concerns of which the National Water Grid advisory body should be aware,” Khan wrote. “Given the significantly increased estimate costs for the Dungowan dam and Wyangala dam projects, there may be some prospect that additional contributions may be requested from the Commonwealth government. “If that is the case, I believe the advisory body should advise against any further commonwealth government funding for either of these projects until a completed business case is provided.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A spokesperson from Joyce said the government has announced funding – “guided by the National Water Grid Investment Framework” – for projects “that will deliver water security, create jobs and drive economic growth”. “In some instances, funding is subject to the completion of a business case, demonstration of value for money and sufficient public benefit for investment,” the spokesperson said. Asked for comment on Wednesday about the dissolution of the advisory board, Khan said the National Water Initiative – an agreement between the federal and state governments – had set out an agenda for responsible and sustainable water management in Australia. “The key principles include ensuring basic financial viability and environmental sustainability prior to committing to funding major infrastructure projects. These principles are essential to ensure sustainable management of Australia’s most valuable resource. “But it is extremely disheartening to see the disregard that current governments have for the [initiative] and its principles. “A renewed NWI, getting Australian governments back on track for sustainable water management, should be at the top of the agenda for any future commonwealth government.”",News/Australia news,Barnaby Joyce abolishes body set up to advise on major water projects after dam announcements,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/barnaby-joyce-abolishes-body-set-up-to-advise-on-major-water-projects-after-dam-announcements
3/30/2022,"Myths and misinformation surrounding the use of contraception are putting women off using modern family planning methods, the UN population fund has warned, as figures showed that nearly half of all pregnancies worldwide are unintended. With more than 250 million women estimated to be not using effective contraception despite wanting to avoid getting pregnant, the UNFPA said that lack of access to family planning was no longer a leading reason for it not being taken up. Instead, it said, while contraceptive use was increasing throughout the world, those women who were deliberately avoiding it were more likely to be doing so out of concerns about “side effects, myths, stigma and opposition from others”. For many women, it stressed, taking contraception was complicated, with nearly a quarter (23%) unable to say no to sex, according to figures first reported in 2020. However, for others who are able to choose freely, “many myths and misperceptions persist and contribute to non-use”, the UN agency found. In a survey of 60 respondents, published in UNFPA’s annual report on Wednesday, one woman from Ghana said she had heard that “contraceptives make people grow fat”. Several women from different countries, including the US, said they had been told that birth control pills could cause infertility. A 43-year-old woman from Burkina Faso said: “We were told contraception makes you sterile.” According to another woman, 31, from Sudan: “People believe it causes infertility, cancer; that it’s a foreign idea.” And an Algerian respondent, 44, had been told that: “Condoms should only be used for sex outside marriage, the pill makes you sterile, the IUD causes haemorrhages.” According to data first published in 2020, nearly half of all pregnancies worldwide – about 121 million – are unintended, with more than 60% of those ending in abortion. An estimated 45% of all abortions are unsafe, the UNFPA says. Speaking as the agency released its report, executive director, Natalia Kanem, said the number of unintended pregnancies was “staggering”. “For the women affected, the most life-altering reproductive choice – whether or not to become pregnant – is no choice at all. By putting the power to make this most fundamental decision squarely in the hands of women and girls, societies can ensure that motherhood is an aspiration and not an inevitability.” The report called for governments to put in place “comprehensive sexuality education” so that women and girls were able to obtain accurate information about their contraceptive options. “Done properly, this education can combat myths and misperceptions, and it can promote communication, consent and respectful relationships. It can address gender and power and teach adolescents about confidential contraceptive care,” the report added.",News/Global development,Contraception myths mean nearly half of pregnancies worldwide unintended – report,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/30/contraception-myths-mean-nearly-half-of-pregnancies-worldwide-unintended-report
3/30/2022,"The UK government is to host a crisis planning meeting with farmers about rocketing fertiliser prices, as part of several moves designed to reduce the impact of rising costs on food production. Quotes for ammonium nitrate fertiliser prices have risen as high as £1,000 a tonne in recent weeks, compared with £280 a tonne a year ago. The cost of fertiliser first rose in response to the increase in wholesale gas prices, because of the levels of energy needed for production. More recently the conflict in Ukraine has exacerbated the situation, disrupting exports from Russia and further increasing production costs. A recent price surge sparked panic buying from some farmers who feared the price would keep rising. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) will host a fertiliser roundtable this week with industry bodies, chaired by the farming minister Victoria Prentis, to discuss pressures on farmers and to come up with possible solutions to soaring prices. The meeting will also look at alternatives to ammonium nitrate fertiliser, including those produced from organic material, as well as the use of some traditional farming practices, where crops are grown without fertiliser. Defra said the government would pay farmers to help them with the cost of sowing nitrogen-fixing plants, such as legumes and clovers, to reduce some of their dependence on manufactured fertilisers. Some farmers, who are already facing increased costs for fuel and animal feed, have warned they will offset the higher prices by buying less fertiliser, which could lead to lower crop production at a time when supplies of cereals are already threatened by the war in Ukraine, which is a major exporter. The environment secretary, George Eustice, said the measures announced by government were “not the whole solution” but intended to help farmers manage their nitrogen needs over the coming year. “The significant rise in the cost of fertiliser is a reminder that we need to reduce our dependence on manufacturing processes dependent on gas. Many of the challenges we face in agriculture will require a fusion of new technology with conventional principles of good farm husbandry,” Eustice said. Mark Tufnell, the president of the Country Land and Business Association welcomed Defra’s announcement, but warned of the “sheer scale of the challenges ahead in the UK’s food production”. “Some farmers may choose not to spread fertiliser at all this year. But if prices continued to stay at this all-time-high then government will need to urgently consider ways of increasing and diversifying domestic fertiliser production,” he said. “We hope this will be a central focus of the roundtable Defra has rightly called.” Defra has also introduced a range of other measures designed to help English farmers deal with rising prices, including a delay in any changes to permitting the use of urea fertiliser. Its use had been expected to be banned to reduce air pollution, following a government consultation launched in 2020. The measures will not be introduced until April 2023. The department said it was also introducing changes to the rules around autumn muck spreading.",News/Business,Defra to hold crisis meeting to tackle impact of fertiliser costs on food prices,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/30/defra-to-hold-crisis-meeting-to-tackle-impact-of-fertiliser-costs-on-food-prices
