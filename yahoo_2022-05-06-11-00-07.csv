5/6/2022,"At a gala Thursday night for an anti-abortion group, former Vice President Mike Pence took aim at sitting Vice President Kamala Harris over remarks she delivered at a pro-choice group’s annual gala two nights earlier. “I say with the lives of 62 million unborn boys and girls ended in abortion since 1973, generations of mothers enduring heartbreaking and loss that can last a lifetime: Madame Vice President, how dare you?” Pence told anti-abortion activists at the annual gala for Carolina Pregnancy Center in Spartanburg, S.C. On Tuesday, Harris spoke at the Washington gala for EMILY’s List, where she sharply criticized Republicans and conservative justices on the Supreme Court after it was revealed that the high court was poised to overturn Roe. v. Wade. “Women in almost half the country could see their access to abortion severely limited,” Harris said of the forthcoming decision. “In 13 of those states, women would lose access to abortion immediately and outright. Those Republican leaders who are trying to weaponize the use of the law against women, well we say, ‘How dare they! How dare they tell a woman what she can do and cannot do with her own body! How dare they!’” Democrats and Republicans have been drawing their battle lines this week, after a stunning scoop by Politico revealed a draft opinion showing the Supreme Court poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, likely ending federal protection for abortion rights and kicking the issue to the states. Pence, a staunch anti-abortion politician, was the headliner at Thursday’s gala, while Harris, who is equally pro-abortion-rights, had top billing at Tuesday’s fundraiser. Neither Pence nor Harris have announced that they will run for president in 2024 or beyond, but both are seen as likely candidates should their respective former running mates decide to opt out.",Politics/Yahoo News,'How dare you?’: Pence goes after Harris for Roe comments,https://news.yahoo.com/how-dare-you-pence-goes-after-harris-for-roe-comments-005522418.html

5/6/2022,"After being berated with racial slurs for not wearing a mask, an Indian man is pursuing charges against a Taiwanese man for “public insult, embarrassment, and verbal abuse.”

On April 29 at 2:40 p.m., the Indian man, a 36-year-old entrepreneur who asked to be identified only as “Mike,” was grabbing a coffee with an Indian national friend at Louisa Coffee in Hsinchu, Taiwan, reported Taiwan News. A Taiwanese man sitting near Mike then approached him, demanding that he put on a mask.

When Mike explained that he was not wearing one in order to drink his coffee and questioned the Taiwanese man for yelling at him, the man responded, “I’m Taiwanese.”

After the 36-year-old told the Taiwanese man to call the police if he felt that a pandemic regulation had been violated, the Taiwanese man became increasingly aggressive, yelling: “You Indian, Indian man, black man, get out of Taiwan.”

According to Mike, he has been living in Taiwan for seven years with his Taiwanese wife and two children. The man in the video can also be seen criticizing Mike for being unable to speak Chinese.

“You don’t speak Chinese but you have been living here for seven years?” the Taiwanese man said to Mike.

Mike recorded parts of the incident, which occurred for over 10 minutes, and after the Taiwanese man called the police, who arrived at the scene around 15 minutes after the incident began.

 

After checking both of the men’s identifications, the Taiwanese man was let go, and Mike was told to file a report at the police station. Officers reassured Mike that he did not violate any law and would not be charged with fines. Under the criminal code of Offenses Against Reputation, Mike pressed charges for “public insult, embarrassment, and verbal abuse.”

Mike told Taiwan News that the incident was the first time he had faced racism while living in Taiwan and was disheartened that “people like him are destroying Taiwan’s reputation.”

“But I won’t let it go, I’m giving my voice on behalf of every single person who is being insulted or abused,” Mike was quoted as saying.

5/6/2022,"Russia's forces have performed far worse than anticipated and, 70 days after the start of the country's invasion of neighbor Ukraine, Ukraine's air force is still holding its own -- thanks, in part, to American military equipment supplying the country with anti-air defenses. Ukraine's forces have destroyed at least 26 Russian planes and 39 helicopters since the beginning of the invasion, according to Oryx, an open-source intelligence blog that keeps tabs on Russian military losses. That success led to media reports of a legendary flying ace dubbed ""The Ghost of Kyiv,"" a mythical pilot whose supposed exploits downing dozens of Russian aircraft spread like wildfire in the early days of the campaign when Ukrainian forces were looking for signs of hope. Read Next: Ukraine Repels Russian Attacks; Mariupol Plant Battle Rages But after reports began to surface this week that the Ghost had been shot down and killed in combat, the country's air force was forced to confess that he was never real. ""The information about the death of the The Ghost of #Kyiv is incorrect,"" Ukraine's air force wrote on Twitter. ""The #GhostOfKyiv is alive, it embodies the collective spirit of the highly qualified pilots of the Tactical Aviation Brigade who are successfully defending #Kyiv and the region."" Ukrainian Maj. Stepan Tarabalka was identified as the ""Ghost of Kyiv'' by multiple media outlets last week, but the news was later clarified by the country's air force. He was a pilot who died in combat March 13 and was posthumously awarded the title Hero of Ukraine, but he was not the mythical flying ace. But even without the Ghost, Ukraine's ability to hold its own against Russia's massive fleet has been notable. One Ukrainian pilot interviewed by CNN on Wednesday, identified only by the call sign ""Moonfish,"" told the news organization he believes Ukraine's pilots have had to get clever to push back against Russia's modern aircraft in the skies. ""We're still operating freely in the airspace that we control and, even though they are a massive fleet of more advanced aircraft, we're able to keep them away from the area we maintain,"" the pilot told CNN. ""We did learn a couple of tricks on how to fight with that technological advancement."" Russia has been touting its Sukhoi SU-57 stealth fighter jet and has more than 120 SU-34 bombers, 360 attack helicopters and hundreds more jets in its fleet, according to a report from CNA, a nonprofit research organization that tracks military strength for the U.S. Navy. But Russia has not been utilizing its full force, focusing less on air-to-air warfare and opting for long-range missiles to attack stationary targets. In part, this has to do with the surge of anti-aircraft weapons the U.S. has given to Ukraine to aid in its fight against Russia. So far, weapons approved to send to Ukraine include more than 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, upward of 5,500 Javelin anti-tank missiles, 700 Switchblade drones, and more than 120 Phoenix Ghost tactical drones. The war is shifting to a new phase, with tough fighting expected in the east of the country as Russia tries to solidify its claims to separatist regions. How Russia's air strategy will change isn't yet clear, but Ukrainians don't appear to be relying on myth anymore. Their pilots are seeing real-world success in what continues to be a brutal, hard-fought campaign. -- Thomas Novelly can be reached at thomas.novelly@military.com. Follow him on Twitter @TomNovelly.
