12/17/2021,"Getty COVID-19 testing As the highly-contagious omicron variant quickly spreads across the country, a respiratory specialist says Americans should expect to see more breakthrough cases of COVID-19 in fully vaccinated people — and that's fine. Speaking on the Today show, Dr. Vin Gupta from the University of Washington said that they're ""forecasting that cases are going to rise"" in both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, but those with their shots are going to be protected against severe illness. ""We have to get comfortable with fully vaccinated folks testing positive, that's going to be our new normal,"" Gupta told the Today show hosts. ""But people should not worry about that because the purpose of vaccines is not to prevent a positive test or a respiratory virus like omicron, it's to keep you out of the hospital, and that's exactly what they're doing.""

""They're totally okay and that's what we expect. The vaccines are doing exactly what they should be for respiratory viruses; they're keeping people out of the hospital and that's a success.""

""So this is going to be a very difficult three to four months ahead.""

12/17/2021,"Trump is upset that Mark Meadows wrote about his appearance while he had COVID-19. Meadows wrote in his new book that Trump had ""red streaks"" in his eyes and ""his hair was a mess."" ""This guy is talking about what I look like, in my bedroom,"" Trump told an advisor, per The Post. Former President Donald Trump is unhappy with his ex-chief of staff Mark Meadows because he wrote in his new book about Trump's appearance while he was sick with COVID-19, according to a Washington Post report published on Wednesday. Meadows wrote that Trump had ""red streaks"" in his eyes and ""his hair was a mess"" while he was ill in bed at the White House. Meadows also described Trump as wearing a T-shirt, which was ""the first time I had seen him in anything other than a golf shirt or a suit jacket."" ""This guy is talking about what I look like, in my bedroom,"" Trump recently complained to an advisor, according to The Post. Meadows had gone to Trump's bedroom to convince him to go to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he could receive further treatment for COVID-19. Trump was hesitant, but ultimately agreed, according to Meadows. These scenes are from Meadows' book ""The Chief's Chief,"" which came out last week and has sparked national headlines with new revelations that Trump tested positive for coronavirus on September 26, 2020, three days before his first presidential debate against then-Democratic candidate Joe Biden — information that was not revealed to the public at the time. Meadows, worried that it could've been a false-positive result, advised Trump to take a second test, which came back negative, Meadows wrote. Trump proceeded to attend a campaign rally, the debate, and other events, potentially coming in contact with some 500 people, The Post found. But days later, when Trump's aide Hope Hicks and first lady Melania Trump tested positive, Trump got tested again, and the result was positive, which he announced on October 1. He was taken to Walter Reed the next day. Meadows praises Trump and portrays him in a positive light in the book, but some of its content has upset the former president. In a statement earlier this month, Trump said that the ""story of me having COVID prior to, or during, the first debate is Fake News. In fact, a test revealed that I did not have COVID prior to the debate."" The Post also previously reported that Trump was ""furious"" that Meadows included the anecdote in his book. ""The president's right. It's fake news,"" Meadows told Newsmax in response to Trump's statement. He did not, however, mention a specific report. ""If you actually read the book, the context of it, that story outlined a false positive. He literally had a test, he had two other tests after that that showed he didn't have COVID during the debate, and yet the way that the media wants to spin it is certainly to be as negative about Donald Trump as they can possibly can, while giving Joe Biden a pass,"" Meadows said.

12/17/2021,"SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Theft of water during a drought. Exploitation of immigrant laborers. Intimidation of residents by armed criminals. A Democratic state senator from southern Oregon said his region, awash in illegal marijuana farms that are protected by gunmen, is starting to look more like a failed state. After hearing him and others testify this week, the Oregon Legislature dedicated $25 million to help police, sheriff's offices and community organizations pay for the ballooning costs of cracking down on the thousands of industrial-scale, illegal pot farms. Residents said the assistance is welcome but not enough. Seven years after Oregon voters passed a ballot measure legalizing the recreational use of marijuana and its regulated cultivation and sale, the state is grappling with an explosion of illegal marijuana farms that have brazenly cropped up, primarily in Josephine and Jackson counties in the south. Hoop houses — cheaply built greenhouses — have been erected along highways and within city limits, with many growers claiming to be legal hemp farmers but cultivating plants with illegal amounts of THC, the component that creates the “high."" The illicit industry is generating billions of dollars in profits and is financed by well-heeled foreign criminal gangs and drug cartels, law enforcement officials said. Jackson County Sheriff Nathan Sickler told lawmakers the cartels “have a business model: Put up more cannabis illegal grows than law enforcement can ever get. They know we’re going to get some, but they know we can’t get it all.” A farmer in southern Oregon — who used a creek for irrigating his crops before it ran dry because an illegal pot farm siphoned off the water, all while the West deals with a climate-change-fueled drought — blames the state for not having enough inspectors to determine which cannabis farms claiming to be hemp really are growing hemp. He spoke on condition he not be identified because he worries the cartels could retaliate against him. The farmer also blames landowners for selling or leasing property to bad actors. “If somebody walks onto your property with a suitcase with $100,000 in $20 bills, you kind of know they're not on the up and up. And if you take that money and allow them to do something on your land, you should probably anticipate that they’re there to break the law,” he said. Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat from the southern town of Ashland, said some rural areas are “military-weapons zones, like the ones we usually associate with failed states.” “Illegal cannabis operations in southern Oregon have been using our limited water supply, abusing local workers, threatening neighbors and negatively impacting businesses run by legal marijuana growers,” said Golden, who pushed to get the measure and related funding on the agenda for the one-day special session. Golden and two other lawmakers from southern Oregon, Rep. Pam Marsh, D-Ashland, and Rep. Lily Morgan, R-Grants Pass, previously said i n a letter to Gov. Kate Brown that workers on the illegal farms are subjected to “conditions approaching slavery.” Some are also being deprived of their promised wages. A 27-year-old Argentinian man said in an interview Wednesday that he learned last August through a WhatsApp message group that workers were needed on a pot farm in southern Oregon. At the time, he was working on a pot farm in Humboldt County, California. He then went to the location near Cave Junction, Oregon, expecting to be paid $2,500 for three weeks of work. He did 12-hour shifts under the hot sun tending the plants and slept in a tent. When three weeks were up, he and other workers went to the farm manager to get paid. “He didn't even look at us. He got in his pickup truck and left,” the worker, who is in the U.S. on a tourist visa, said. He spoke on condition he not be named because of federal immigration laws. When he called the manager, there was no answer. Another worker went to the farm for the wages but had a gun aimed at him. “The truth is, I'm very disappointed and I don't understand why they were that way with me when I was respectful and I worked all the hours they asked of me,"" the man said over the phone from Florida, where he was trying to find temporary work before flying home for Christmas. T he bill passed by the Legislature Monday and signed by the governor on Tuesday establishes the “Illegal Marijuana Market Enforcement Grant Program” to assist cities and counties with costs incurred by local law enforcement in addressing illegal pot farms. It will be administered by the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission. “It will help,” said Josephine County Sheriff Dave Daniel. “But the issue is metastasizing statewide.” Sheriff's offices and other law enforcement that apply for the grants will have to work with community-based organizations to deal with the labor trafficking, said Morgan, the lawmaker. Of the $25 million, $5 million is dedicated to enforcing water rights. Several bills coming in the 2022 legislative session will address further needs, she said. ___ Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky",U.S./Associated Press,"Awash in illegal pot farms, Oregon plans millions for relief",https://news.yahoo.com/awash-illegal-pot-farms-oregon-192639637.html

 Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) sent a warning shot to Republicans on Wednesday night: Cut a quick deal on more than 20 Biden nominees or prepare to work into the week of Christmas. Schumer, from the Senate floor on Wednesday night, teed up votes on 22 nominees, including several judicial picks and long-stalled ambassador nominations. The move, which sets up a marathon series of votes to start on Friday absent an agreement, comes as Schumer and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) are in a standoff over confirming Biden's ambassador nominees, dozens of whom are awaiting a vote in the Senate but being held up by Cruz. Cruz, according to GOP senators, had offered to lift his hold, which prevents quick confirmation of a nominee, on 16 of Biden's ambassador picks in exchange for getting a vote on Nord Stream 2 pipeline sanctions, his long-held goal. Schumer, during a speech from the Senate floor on Wednesday morning, said Cruz had to drop his holds on any State Department, Treasury Department and U.S. Agency for International Development nominees for a deal. ""We have been working over the past day to secure a lift on many of these holds. I want to echo what Sen. [Bob] Menendez [D-N.J.] has made clear: If the Senator from Texas offers a proposal that does not include lifting all State, Treasury, and USAID nominees holds, we cannot come to an agreement,"" Schumer said. But Cruz rejected that, questioning why Schumer would draw that line when, he says, they had previously agreed to a deal for a Nord Stream 2 vote as a defense bill amendment in exchange for Cruz dropping his holds on seven nominees. In addition to disagreements over the number of nominees Cruz would need to drop his holds on, senators say there are also disagreements about who would be on the list to get a vote before the end of the year. ""That was just silliness and he knows that,"" Cruz said about Schumer's demand. ""If he wants to engage in partisan posturing, he can.""",Politics/The Hill,Schumer tees up nominations marathon as deal with Cruz elusive,https://news.yahoo.com/schumer-tees-nominations-marathon-deal-020516483.html
12/17/2021,"REDDING, Calif. (AP) — Heavy snow, blizzard conditions and stuck vehicles prompted the closure of a portion of the West Coast’s major interstate linking California to Oregon as the latest of back-to-back storms pushed through, authorities said. Interstate 5 was closed north of the city of Redding on Wednesday afternoon and had not reopened early Thursday, according to the California Department of Transportation, known as Caltrans. Redding is about 200 miles (320 kilometers) north of San Francisco. There was no estimated time for reopening because highway and utility crews were still assessing the roadway, removing hazardous trees and restoring power lines, said Haleigh Pike, a Caltrans spokesperson. The Oregon Department of Transportation tweeted Wednesday evening that it closed southbound lanes of I-5 starting in the city of Ashland at the request of California officials. Winter storm warnings or advisories were expected to remain in effect through midmorning Thursday in parts of Northern California, Oregon and Nevada, followed by lingering rain and snow showers, forecasters said. South of San Francisco, a 40-mile (64-kilometer) stretch of the scenic Highway 1 in the Big Sur area reopened Wednesday evening after storm damage was cleaned up.
