1/20/2022,"The Duke of York’s social media accounts are being deleted as he continues his legal battle to fight a sexual assault lawsuit filed against him in the US. It comes just days after the Queen stripped her second son of his honorary military affiliations and royal patronages, and his agreement not to use his royal style HRH in any official capacity.  Prince Andrew’s official Twitter handle, TheDukeOfYork, now leads to a blank page. His YouTube page is also no longer accessible. While his Instagram account, hrhthedukeofyork, still appeared on Wednesday, it is understood that, too, was being removed, along with his Facebook account, but some accounts are taking longer to filter through. Royal aides have also updated the British monarchy’s official website as Buckingham Palace seeks to distance the institution from Andrew’s legal battle. While the priince still appears under the section Members of the Royal Family, the list of his military affiliations and patronages has been removed. Buckingham Palace announced last week that the roles would be shared out among other members of the royal family. The decision was made after discussion between senior family members. The website also includes details of the Queen’s statement, reading: “In January 2022, Buckingham Palace made a statement announcing that, with the Queen’s approval and agreement, the Duke of York’s military affiliations and Royal patronages have been returned to the Queen, and the Duke will continue to not carry out public duties.” Under the heading Supporting the Queen, Andrew’s official duties are listed in the past tense, such as attending trooping the colour and his diamond jubilee tour to India on behalf of the monarch. The website states: “An important part of the Duke of York’s role was to support the Queen’s work as head of state.”  In the early 90s, Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of British media tycoon Robert Maxwell, met investment banker and financier Jeffrey Epstein. Their relationship was initially romantic, but it evolved into something more akin to Maxwell being a confidante and personal assistant.  Prince Andrew was reportedly introduced to Epstein through Maxwell in 1999, and Epstein reportedly visited the Queen’s private retreatin Aberdeenshire. Some have suggested the introduction was made earlier. A 2011 letter to the Times of London from the prince’s then private secretary, Alastair Watson, suggests Andrew and Epstein knew each other from the early 90s. Andrew, Maxwell and Epstein are seen together at DonaldTrump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. Later that year, Epstein and Maxwellattend a joint birthday party at Windsor Castle hosted by the Queen. Andrew and Epstein holiday together and are pictured on a yacht in Phuket, Thailand, surrounded by topless women. The Times of London reported the prince’s holiday was paid for by Epstein. In the same year, Virginia Giuffre, then 17, claims to have had sexwith Andrew in Maxwell’s home in Belgravia, London. Giuffre, whose surname was Roberts at the time of the alleged incidents, says she slept with Andrew twice more, at Epstein’sNew York home and at an “orgy” on his private island in the Caribbean. Epstein is jailed for 18 months by a Florida state court after pleading guilty toprostituting minors. Soon after his release, Epstein is visited byAndrew in New York. The pair are photographed together in Central Park. Footageemerges years later, reportedly shot on 6 December, that appears to show Andrewinside Epstein’s Manhattan mansion waving goodbye to a woman from behind a door. Andrew quits his role as UK trade envoy following afurore over the Central Park photos. Allegations that Andrew had sex with Giuffre emergein court documents in Florida related to Epstein. The papers say she was forced to have sex with Andrew when she was 17, which is below theage of consent under Florida law. Buckingham Palace denies the allegations. The claims against Andrew are later struck from US civilcourt records following a federal judge’s ruling. Andrew is accused of sexualimpropriety by a second alleged Epstein victim, Johanna Sjoberg. She claims hetouched her breast at the billionaire’s Manhattan apartment in 2001.Buckingham Palace says the allegations are ""categorically untrue"". Epstein is found dead in his jail cell after being re-arrested and charged with sex trafficking. A medical examiner says the death was a suicide. A pilot on Epstein’s private jet later that month claims Andrew was a passenger on past flights with the financier and Giuffre. Andrew takes part in a disastrous BBC TV interview during which he claims he could not have had sex with Giuffre because he was at home after a visit to Pizza Express in Woking, and that her description of his dancing with her beforehand could not be true because he was unable to sweat, and that he had ""no recollection of ever meeting this lady"". After several days of negative reaction, Andrew announces he is to step back from public duties ""for the foreseeable future"". US prosecutor Geoffrey Berman gives a public statement suggesting there has been ""zero cooperation"" with the investigation from Andrew. After Berman again claims Andrew has ""completely shut the door"" on cooperating with the US investigation in March, lawyers for the prince insist he has repeatedly offered to cooperate and accuse US prosecutors of misleading the public and breaching confidentiality. Maxwell, who has seldom been seen in public in recent years, is arrested by the FBI on charges related to Epstein. Unsealed testimony from a 2015 civil case reveal a series of claims about her role in Epstein's sex-trafficking ring, including allegations that she trained underage girls as sex slaves.  US officials confirm that Prince Andrew has received court papers relating to a sexual assault civil lawsuit from Giuffre, seeking damages. Her lawyers had earlier said the duke had officially been served with the papers, but his legal team had disputed the claim. Two weeks later, a court in New York granted his lawyers permission to see the confidential settlement agreement between Giuffre and Epstein. The Metropolitan police in London say they are taking no further action after a review of the allegations that Prince Andrew assaulted Giuffre. In August, the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, had said “no one is above the law” and that she had asked her team to look at the material again. Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial ends with a guilty verdict on five of the six counts she faced. A judge in New York rejects Prince Andrew’s attempt to throw out the sexual abuse civil lawsuit brought against him by Giuffre. The prince's lawyers had attempted to argue that Giuffre’s 2009 settlement with Epstein shielded the duke from her taking legal action against him. Queen Elizabeth II strips her son of a range of military affiliations and royal patronages after more than 150 military veterans write to describe their “upset and anger”. Virginia Giuffre, 38, is suing the duke, 61, in the US for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager. She claims she was trafficked by his friend, the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, to have sex with Andrew when she was 17 and a minor under US law. The duke has strenuously denied the allegations. The Duke of Cambridge made no response when he was asked whether he backed his uncle on Wednesday. Prince William was leaving the Foundling Museum in London with the Duchess of Cambridge when a member of a TV news crew asked: “Do you support Prince Andrew?” William leaned closer to hear and then walked past without commenting.",News/UK news,Prince Andrew’s social media accounts deleted as he fights US lawsuit,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/19/prince-andrew-social-media-accounts-deleted-as-he-fights-us-lawsuit
1/20/2022,"This image, part of a series called Imaginary Trip, was taken in an abandoned train outside Kinshasa station in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I was looking for a site to evoke an imaginary voyage to convey the idea of memory, the passage of time and the reappropriation of old places. A lot of young men hang around this area, which is a poor neighbourhood, and they squat in the trains during the day while doing various jobs such as helping people at the station. Sometimes they have something to do, other times nothing. The two people in this photograph are both me. I took several digital images and then superimposed them to represent two young men playing a traditional game of draughts with bottle tops – as they do. When I started out on this project, I did not intend to put myself in the photographs – it was almost accidental. I did not have the money to pay for models, so it was partly a question of budget, but also of time. I spend ages in these places creating my photographs, too long for most people to hang around, so in the end I found myself in front of and behind the camera. I often work alone with a camera, a tripod and a remote trigger.  In the picture, you see a bag from the local market in Kinshasa that gives the scene a more global context – “See the north” is written on it. You cannot see anything out of the windows of the train, so this voyage could be taking place anywhere in the world. The picture is complete in itself, but fits in with the rest of the series to tell a bigger story: the series shows a trip that begins somewhere, but doesn’t end, and the destination is a mystery. Some figures in the other photographs in the series are transparent. They represent people who have passed through this abandoned place in the past, and those who may pass through it in the future. Many see them as ghosts, but I see them as representing people who have been here and will come here. Setting pictures in abandoned places evokes the duality of the personal and the collective memory, as well as the history of the DRC: the train carriage here is from the era of colonisation. The idea is to use a figurative voyage to evoke the passing of time, in a real and imaginary sense. My father is a professional photographer and I began as a teenager helping him out at weddings and other events. One day, I just took one of his cameras and didn’t give it back. When I decided, at around 17 years old, that I wanted to make this my career, too, he didn’t exactly try to discourage me, but he was worried that I wouldn’t be able to make a success of it. It is complicated in the DRC – and in many other African countries – because being a photographer was not considered a job for a woman and it still isn’t, largely. I would go to take pictures at an event and people would refer to me as the “Sunday photographer” meaning an amateur, someone who takes family snaps, so, while nobody actually told me to stop, it was very discouraging. When I tell people that I am a photographer they are surprised, even though there are more female photographers in the DRC today, our number is still small, and it remains a macho society. In 2013, I decided I was going to stop doing marriages and commercial work and focus on personal photography projects. It was a difficult time because I had no money, no resources and it took three years to sell my first photo. I had finished my studies and people would say: “When are you going to find some real work?” But for me, working on Imaginary Trip was my real work. I believe it is important, especially in this age, to detach oneself from what is fashionable and from so-called rules about what works or does not work. I tell myself, voila! I will do this photograph because it pleases me. Whether it works or not is not important.

1/20/2022,"$20bn (£14.7bn) has been wiped off the value of Sony after its rival Microsoft announced a record-breaking deal to buy the Call of Duty publisher Activision Blizzard and take the console wars into the metaverse. Shares in the Japanese conglomerate closed down 13% on Wednesday, their biggest fall since the global financial crisis in 2008, as investors reacted to the possibility that the $70bn bid for Activision Blizzard could result in hit games titles being pulled from the Sony PlayStation console and subscription service and offered exclusively on the rival Microsoft Xbox and subscription service.  The blockbuster deal is not only the largest Microsoft has struck but also the biggest ever in the gaming and tech sectors. It sparked a wave of investor interest in further consolidation, with shares in Electronic Arts, the maker of the Fifa football series, and Take-Two Interactive, the maker of Grand Theft Auto, rising. The shares of other video games companies also rose. France’s Ubisoft, which makes Assassin’s Creed, was up almost 12%, while Japan’s Capcom and Square Enix both rose 3.5%. “Sony’s response [to the deal] will be one to watch, of course,” said Clay Griffin, an analyst at the research firm MoffettNathanson. “But we question its ability to go toe to toe with Microsoft financially. We doubt Sony could digest something of the scale of Electronic Arts or Take-Two.” Sony has led Microsoft in the sale of consoles and exclusive games, such as Spider-Man and God of War, which have bolstered revenue from its PlayStation Plus subscription service. On Tuesday, Microsoft said it aimed to offer as many of Activision Blizzard’s hit titles, which also include World of Warcraft, on its Xbox Game Pass and PC Pass subscription services. Analysts were divided over whether Microsoft would look to take the flagship game Call of Duty exclusive, as it would mean a huge financial hit by not licensing it globally. As much as 65% of Activision Blizzard’s games console revenue comes from Sony’s PS5. Microsoft has said more broadly that the deal will “provide the building blocks for the metaverse”. Griffin said: “The vision Microsoft laid out yesterday was not of ‘winning’ the console wars versus Sony, necessarily. That’s part of it, of course. But more than that, it was about broadening … access to [premium] video games beyond the constraining barriers of expensive hardware.” The deal, which could still be countered by a rival bid, will result in Microsoft becoming the world’s third-biggest gaming company by revenue behind China’s Tencent and Sony. A rival bid is considered to be unlikely given the scale of the offer. The deal dwarfs Microsoft’s $7.5bn takeover of Zenimax, the owner of Bethesda, the maker of makes the Elder Scrolls game, in 2020. Its previous biggest acquisition was the $26bn buyout of LinkedIn in 2016.",News/Technology,Microsoft takeover of Call of Duty games firm wipes $20bn off Sony shares,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/19/microsoft-takeover-call-of-duty-games-firm-wipes-20bn-off-sony-shares-playstation-activision-blizzard-games
1/20/2022,"The French actor Gaspard Ulliel has died at the age of 37 after a skiing accident. The star of A Very Long Engagement and Hannibal Rising was hospitalised after the accident in the Alps. Ulliel was transported via helicopter on Tuesday to Grenoble but did not survive his injuries, according to the actor’s family and agent.  Local broadcaster France Bleu reported that Ulliel collided with another skier at a crossing point, suffering head trauma. It said the other skier was not hospitalized. An investigation is currently under way. After some television work, Ulliel had a small role in 2001’s Brotherhood of the Wolf, alongside Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci. Acclaimed work in French films Summer Things and Strayed then led to the romantic lead in Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s A Very Long Engagement, opposite Audrey Tautou. The performance saw him win a Cesar for most promising actor. Ulliel was then cast as young Hannibal Lecter in prequel Hannibal Rising, and as Yves Saint Laurent in biopic Laurent which scored him a Cesar nomination for best actor. He later won the award for Xavier Dolan’s It’s Only the End of the World. Ulliel was also known for being the face of the fragrance Bleu de Chanel. He will next be seen as Midnight Man in the Marvel show Moon Knight with Oscar Isaac and Ethan Hawke. Jean Castex, the French prime minister, paid tribute on Twitter, writing that Ulliel “grew up with cinema and cinema grew with him”.

1/20/2022,"Pharmaceuticals company GSK’s chief scientific officer is jumping ship, dealing a blow to the drugmaker as it seeks to rebuild its pipeline of new medicines and gears up for a corporate split in the summer. Hal Barron, the highly-regarded American scientist and veteran of Roche and Genentech, was one of GSK chief executive Emma Walmsley’s key hires a few months after she took the helm in April 2017.  His departure, after just four years in the job, comes at a critical time, as GSK is under pressure from the activist investor Elliott Management, a New York hedge fund, to improve its operational and share price performance. Barron, 60, will be replaced by Tony Wood as GSK’s chief scientific officer on 1 August, when he joins the biotech Altos Labs, based in the San Francisco bay area, which reportedly counts the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos among its backers. Barron will stay on GSK’s board as a non-executive director, providing advice on research and development. Panmure Gordon analyst David Cox said: “Dr Hal Barron arrived with great fanfare a few years ago and is highly regarded in the industry. The fact that GSK is in the process of spinning off its consumer health business means there is a lot of pressure on R&D (and M&A) to come up with new innovative products for what will be the ‘new GSK’ post-split. They need to get R&D right and do not have the best track record in recent times.” The drugmaker’s plans for a summer stock market flotation of the consumer health venture it has with Pfizer have been thrown into disarray by news of a £50bn offer from Unilever at the weekend. GSK has resisted pressure from Elliott to sell off the business, and said it had rejected three bids from the Marmite and Dove soap maker because they “fundamentally undervalued” the business and its prospects. As the head of R&D, which is vital to a drugmaker, Barron is the highest-paid executive at GSK, and received a total package of $11.2m (£8.2m) in 2020, while Walmsley was paid £7m, the company’s most recent annual report shows. One of his biggest ideas has been to leverage the immune system to attack multiple diseases, and using genetic data to identify new drugs. Walmsley brought him in to shake up the company’s $6bn research division and tackle a culture that she described as “too slow and rather bureaucratic” in July 2018. A year earlier, she had already set out plans to tighten the drug portfolio and focus on “winners” – potential blockbuster medicines with annual revenues of more than $1bn. However, last summer Elliott still attacked GSK’s culture as “overly bureaucratic”. Graham Parry and Sachin Jain, analysts at Bank of America, said: “Wood has a solid background in discovery, especially in small molecules at Pfizer and more recently in broader discovery/development at GSK. However, he is less well known to investors and, despite his broader role at GSK, we expect investors to initially view him through the lens of his medicinal chemistry background and look for evidence of breadth beyond this when he takes the reins.” Walmsley described Wood, who joined GSK from Pfizer in early 2017, as an “outstanding scientist who is highly respected inside and outside GSK” and has been a “key partner to Hal in delivering our R&D approach”. She said Barron’s appointment to Altos Labs was a “unique opportunity” for him but added that GSK would continue to benefit from his expertise on the board and in support of R&D. Altos Labs, created last year, has been hiring scientists from around the world to spearhead its efforts to explore the biology of cellular rejuvenation programming with the goal of reversing disease.",News/Business,GSK’s top scientist jumps ship in new blow for pharmaceutical firm,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/19/gsks-top-scientist-jumps-ship-in-new-blow-for-pharmaceutical-firm
1/20/2022,"Yiry Ulshin surveyed a scene of ruin. Before him were the remains of what was once a school. Desks were covered in debris. A photo of the class of 2011 lay in the wreckage. There were abandoned crayons and year 3 books in Ukrainian and Russian. Beyond a bullet-splattered wall was a view of pine trees and sea. “My heart is hurting. Why did Russia do this?” Ulshin – a Ukrainian army commander – asked.  The abandoned primary school is situated in Shyrokyne in eastern Ukraine, on the frontline between the Ukrainian army and pro-Russian forces. The village was once a resort. Tourists would stay in its guesthouses, walk along the sandy beach and paddle in the picturesque Sea of Azov. Now it is a ghostly wreck. In 2014 Russia annexed Crimea, down the coast, and kickstarted a violent conflict in the Donbas region. The following year Ukrainian militias clawed back some of the province’s seaside strip including Shyrokyne, 14 miles east of the port city of Mariupol. “My friend was killed in fighting here,” Ulshin said. Today the village’s holiday complex resembles a phantasmagoric film set. An alley of pulverised flats leads on to a glass-strewn summer terrace. There is a rusted child’s bicycle, a washing machine and a savagely twisted bonnet from a GAZ-53 truck. The ground is pitted with shell holes. Swimming is not advised: the beach is mined. A seagull floated above it. The separatists did not retreat far, ensconcing themselves in the hillside village of Vodyane, just over a mile away, and visible from the net-covered former sanatorium that serves as the soldiers’ frontline base. Washing is hanging on a line; logs are piled up for fuel. “Two days ago they fired a rocket at one of our cars, out on patrol,” Ulshin said. “It missed.” Was anywhere in the village safe? “No,” Ulshin said. “Death happens when you don’t expect it. The Russians [separatists] work very professionally. A sniper shot me in 2018. I lost so much blood people thought I wasn’t going to make it. But here I am. Ten of my men have been wounded.” Since autumn Russia has assembled a potential invasion force of 100,000 soldiers on Ukraine’s borders. The latest signals are ominous. The Kremlin says military exercises will take place next month in Belarus, 90 miles north of the capital, Kyiv. According to the Ukrainian government Russian forces are covertly stationed in rebel mini-fiefdoms in the cities of Donetsk – adjacent to Mariupol – and Luhansk. So far, Putin has kept the world guessing as to what he plans to do. The EU and US have condemned Russian aggression and threatened sanctions. This week, the UK flew defensive anti-tank weapons to Kyiv. The Biden administration is reportedly considering military help. On Wednesday, the US secretary of state Antony Blinken visited Kyiv. None of this is likely to stop a Russian incursion, should Putin order one. “Look at history. All conflicts have an active phase and a less active one,” Ulshin said. The Kremlin would not seize the whole of Ukraine, an enormous and bloody undertaking, he thought; instead it would pursue hybrid war, with the goal of toppling Ukraine’s Nato-aspiring government and replacing it. Ukraine’s soldiers are motivated, professional and ready to defend their homes. But it is obvious they are badly outgunned. Ulshin said he had received some help from Lithuania in the shape of four lightweight bullet-proof plates. In the near distance shots rang out, followed by a percussive boom from an auto-grenade launcher. Ukraine lost much of its navy in 2014, when Russian special forces seized Crimea. Moscow eventually returned the Donbas, an ageing Soviet warship that now sits in Mariupol’s port alongside two small armoured artillery boats, the Ludny and Kremenchuk. This meagre collection is no match for Russia’s mighty Black Sea fleet. “It’s old but reliable,” Cptn Oleksandr Hrigorevskiy said, pointing to the Donbas’s bow machine gun. Stamped on the side was a date: 1954. The Russians trashed the ship’s communication system before handing it back, he said, and many of his former officer colleagues defected. The boat subsequently caught fire. It is now used as a command and repair ship. The deck offers a sweeping view of the Azov Sea bathed in a raspberry light. At 9am each morning sailors raise and salute the Ukrainian flag. At night the Russian port of Yeysk twinkles in the distance. The Azov and Black seas are a key commercial route for Russia, linked to a network of rivers and canals. According to Hrigorevskiy, the Kremlin has annexed the Azov Sea by stealth. Under a 2003 agreement, Russia and Ukraine are supposed to share access. But Moscow now controls Crimea’s Kerch Strait, the only way in and out. In 2018 it started impounding Ukrainian civilian vessels, dealing a death blow to Mariupol as a cargo port. Of late, Moscow has declared large chunks of the internal sea off limits to Ukrainian boats, citing the need to carry out “naval exercises”. When the Donbas set off towards Kerch in December, sailing in international waters, Putin’s FSB spy agency accused Kyiv of an act of aggression. “We watched a report on Russian TV. They play psychological games,” Hrigorevskiy said. Mariupol stands in the way of any potential Russian advance from the east. In 2014, Kremlin-backed separatists controlled the city for two months. Since then pro-Kyiv volunteers have moved to the area. Anatoliy Lozar helped to liberate Mariupol, and subsequently married a local woman. He said Russian sentiment was still strong, especially among older residents.“Television plays a big role,” he said. “You can get Russian state channels for free. You have to pay for Ukrainian ones.” Lozar said most people in Mariupol vote for the opposition party of Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Moscow oligarch accused of treason and now under house arrest. Over at Mariupol’s aerodrome, soldiers acknowledged that Moscow was likely to bomb the runway and other strategic military targets, should it attack. “Yes, we can’t defend physical infrastructure. But we’ve learned to spread our forces out, to minimise losses,” Taras Eleyko said. He added: “Putin is a card-sharp. He would need 600,000 troops to occupy Ukraine. He doesn’t have that.” Eleyko was part of a travelling amateur theatre troupe from western Ukraine. The group had arrived at the military airport to entertain troops with a traditional mystery play known as a vertep. This one featured familiar characters such as an angel and devil, as well a crown-wearing Putin – plus Joe Biden, who carried a stars and stripe flag. The show took place in what was once the departure lounge, beneath a colourful communist-era mosaic. Someone had pasted Ukraine’s blue and yellow flag over the old hammer and sickle. The play ended with Death – actually Olena Chebeliuk, a historian from Lviv – chasing “Putin” off to hell. She wore a skeleton costume and carried a white scythe. ‘We’re afraid Russia will invade and capture Ukraine. Our army is not very ready to fight” Chebeliuk said, speaking in fluent English. “We don’t really have Stingers or patriot missiles. We only have old Soviet rockets, many of them not in a good state. If there is a big war, I fear in the first weeks we will have many casualties.” Chebeliuk predicted that a Russian offensive would set off a partisan war. “A lot of us are ready to fight. We will resist in every city, in every village. Ukrainians hate Putin, especially in the west of our country. I hope Putin is just pretending with his threats, to get something from the west and Biden.” Whenever Ukrainian rulers began acting like dictators the people rose up against them, she said, citing the 2014 “revolution of dignity” in Kyiv against the then president, Viktor Yanukovych. Chebeliuk rejected Putin’s recent claims that Ukraine and Russia were “one people”. “Russians have lived for 20 years in a dictatorship. They are happy,” she said. “We don’t like dictators here. Putin is a bit of a dreamer. He wants to be the most powerful man in the world. If he tries to make a dictatorship in Ukraine he will fail.”",News/World news,Fear and defiance on Ukraine’s frontline: ‘We don’t like dictators here’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/ukraine-frontline-fear-and-defiance
1/20/2022,"The names and faces of 12 of the most wanted British criminal suspects thought to be hiding in Spain have been published by police in a bid to track them down. A joint campaign involving Spanish and UK police forces was launched on Wednesday in Madrid with a picture gallery of men wanted in connection with crimes including murder, drug trafficking and arms smuggling.  The list of alleged fugitives thought to be hiding in mainland Spain or the Spanish islands includes two men accused of killing members of rival criminal gangs. According to the National Crime Agency list Nana Oppong, 41, is wanted by Essex police in connection with the drive-by killing of Robert Powell, 50, who was shot eight times with a pistol in June 2020. Callum Halpin, 27, is wanted by Greater Manchester police over the 2018 killing of alleged rival Luke Graham, 31, in a gang turf war. The list also includes Jack Mayle, 30, from Croydon, who allegedly sold the class A drug MDMA via a phoneline in south London, called the Flavour Quest. When he fled the UK, according to the NCA, his tattoos included a diamond under his left eye and the word Croydon on his left forearm. The National Crime Agency’s director general of operations, Steve Rodhouse, who attended the launch of the campaign alongside the Spanish security minister Rafael Pérez Ruiz, insisted that Spain “is not a safe haven” for criminals. He said: “The last thing the fugitives’ associates will want is the combined determination and capabilities of the UK and Spanish law enforcement focusing on them.” Rodhouse said many of the wanted men on the list would have tried to blend in with British communities in Spain. In an appeal to expats for information, he said: “Loyalties change over time and we urge anyone with information about these men to help us find them.” The list also includes two suspected drug dealers from Cardiff who used the secret phone network EncroChat before it was taken down in an international operation. Asim Naveed, 29, described as muscular and 6ft 2in, is accused of being the leader of a drug smuggling gang that brought 46kg of cocaine, worth nearly £8m, into Wales between February and June 2020. His alleged customer Calvin Parris, 32, who has gold upper teeth, is accused of selling cocaine in the Welsh capital. Another suspect is James “Jamie” Stevenson, 56, who is wanted by the National Crime Agency and Police Scotland after the seizure of about 1 tonne of cocaine at the Port of Dover in September 2020, and 28m “street Valium” tablets in a raid on a suspected pill factory in Kent in June that year. Stevenson, who is stocky and described as having a scar on the left side of his face, is also wanted in connection with two suspected arson attacks in Lanarkshire and Forth Valley in May 2020. Rafael Pérez Ruiz said: “The campaign allows us to reinforce and strengthen police collaboration between Spain and the United Kingdom with the aim of creating a hostile environment which impedes criminal organisations from setting up in Spain and criminals from settling in our cities.” Anyone with information can call Crimestoppers anonymously in the UK on 0800 555 111 or from Spain on 900 926 111, or online at crimestoppers-uk.org/fugitives.",News/UK news,Police appeal for help to find 12 of UK’s most wanted suspects in Spain,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/19/police-appeal-for-help-to-find-12-of-uks-most-wanted-suspects-in-spain
1/20/2022,"Boris Johnson has announced that England will be moving from plan B to plan A on 26 January to reflect the fact that the Omicron wave has peaked. What does that mean for everyday life?  The government will no longer mandate the wearing of face masks anywhere, which means it will no longer be a criminal offence not to wear one without an exemption. This includes classrooms, and national guidance from the Department for Education will shortly be removed on their use in communal areas in schools.However, some businesses and organisations, for example transport operators or shops, may still request that people wear them, which means you may be refused access if you do not comply.The prime minister also said the government “will continue to suggest the use of face coverings in enclosed or crowded places, particularly where you come into contact with people you don’t normally meet.” Mandatory Covid status certification will end, although organisations can use the NHS Covid pass voluntarily. The work-from-home guidance will be lifted. Workers are instructed to speak to their employers about arrangements for returning to the office, as it is still at their discretion whether to allow staff to work there, and some will take a more cautious approach than others. Yes, soon. Further details on how restrictions will be lifted will be set out by the health secretary, Sajid Javid, in the coming days. Self-isolation is still a legal requirement for people who have tested positive. From 17 January the isolation period was reduced from seven to five days, provided that people obtained two negative tests on the fourth and fifth days. Johnson said he planned to remove the obligation to self-isolate when the regulations expire on 24 March, a date that may be brought forward “if the data allows”. This would mirror the approach to comparable endemic viruses such as the flu. Speaking to the House of Commons, Johnson also said the government would in the coming weeks publish its long-term strategy for living with Covid, which would aim to avoid restrictions and instead take advantage of developments in medical science and offer guidance “urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others”. He added that people must remain cautious during the last weeks of winter as the pandemic was not over, with 16,000 people still in hospital in England. Omicron is not necessarily a mild disease, especially for those who are not yet vaccinated. Protective measures include washing hands, letting in fresh air, getting tested, self-isolating if positive and wearing masks in crowded or enclosed spaces. There were no new announcements on travel. Pre-departure tests were scrapped earlier in January, but fully vaccinated travellers must book a PCR or lateral flow test ahead of their trip to England to be taken within 48 hours of arrival. The prime minister’s spokesperson said this was to provide “that extra layer of surveillance” to watch out for the emergence of new variants, but that the government would review the rules by the end of January, with changes rumoured to take place before the half-term holidays in February. Those who are not vaccinated must test 48 hours in advance and quarantine for 10 days, with tests on days two and eight. Testing is still in place for travel to some other countries but rules vary. There are no legal rules on socialising in England, so it is up to businesses to decide whether to socially distance their customers to make them feel more at ease, or for individuals to do so to minimise their risk of catching Covid.",News/Politics,Plan A: what are the new Covid rules in England?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/plan-a-new-covid-rules-england
