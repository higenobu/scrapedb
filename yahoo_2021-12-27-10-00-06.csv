12/27/2021,"The Department of Defense (DoD) announced last week that troops in 15 metropolitan areas and 21 non-metropolitan counties in the continental United States will be cut off from a cost-of-living allowance starting Jan. 1. The change will lead to approximately 48,000 troops missing out on the Continental United States Cost-of-Living Allowance (CONUS COLA), according to Stars and Stripes. Approximately 6,000 service members will remain recipients of the $8.5 million that the Pentagon allocated for the stipend, which is given to troops who are stationed at excessively expensive locations in the lower 48. The 2022 list comprises 20 non-metropolitan counties and six metropolitan areas, which include New York City, Long Island, and Staten Island in New York; Nantucket, Mass.; Boulder, Colo.; and San Francisco, Calif. DEFENSE DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCES HOUSING ALLOWANCE RAISE AND OTHER MEASURES TO ASSIST STRUGGLING TROOPS The COLA rate is based on information gathered by a contractor, which analyzes cost of transportation, goods and services, federal income taxes, sales taxes, and miscellaneous expenses, according to the DoD. A location becomes eligible for COLA when non-housing costs exceed 8% above the national average. Among the locations that were cut in 2022 is the Washington, D.C., area, where troops had received a 1% supplement in 2021. Stipends for troops in Boston and Worcester, Mass., also got the ax. Troops located in New York City will receive the highest stipend at 6%, which is down from 7% in 2021. How much COLA a service member earns depends on geographic duty location, pay grade, years of service, and dependency status. The Pentagon explained that monthly payments for each CONUS COLA percentage point vary from $33 to $59 per month for troops with dependents, and from $22 to $45 per month for those without dependents.",U.S./Fox News,Pentagon to cut stateside cost-of-living stipend for thousands of troops in 2022,https://news.yahoo.com/pentagon-cut-stateside-cost-living-215007574.html
12/27/2021,"By age 30, you should have saved an amount equal to your annual salary for retirement, as both Fidelity and Ally Bank recommend. If your salary is $75,000, you should have $75,000 put away. How do you do that? ""When starting your career, commit to automatic savings of 20% per year into your 401(k). It will discipline you to live and give on the remaining 80%,"" said Jason Parker of Parker Financial in the Seattle area, author of ""Sound Retirement Planning"" and host of the ""Sound Retirement Radio"" podcast. Taxes: Most Tax-Friendly States To Retire Many Americans don't sign up for a 401(k) in their 20s, meaning they aren't taking advantage of a potential employer match. ""An employer match on your 401(k) is free money, but roughly a quarter of employees are leaving free money on the table by not taking advantage of their match,"" said Brian Walsh, a certified financial planner and financial planning manager at SoFi. He added that in some cases, planning for retirement can trump paying down debt. ""Many young people we work with hate being in debt and strive to pay off their debt as quickly as possible,"" he said. ""That is admirable, but sometimes it simply does not make sense to aggressively pay down debt instead of saving. While eliminating debt is important, you also need to prioritize saving for your future. We consider any debt with an interest rate below 7% to be good debt and suggest saving some of your money before aggressively paying that debt down.""

If you don't have a retirement savings strategy as part of your overall financial plan by this point, don't delay, one expert said. ""Every household, regardless of their net worth or stage of life, owes it to themselves to create a comprehensive, individualized financial plan,"" said Drew Parker, creator of The Complete Retirement Planner. Be Aware: The Downsides of Retirement That Nobody Talks About ""The most common mistake is that people let their spending increase commensurate with their new salary. For instance, people move into a bigger apartment or buy a more expensive car or home to reward themselves for receiving the raise,"" said Dr. Robert R. Johnson, a professor of finance in the Heider College of Business at Creighton University. ""What happens is they are unable to improve their financial condition because they spend everything they make. People are wise to effectively invest any money from a raise as if you didn't receive the raise. That is, continue to live the same lifestyle you led before receiving a raise and invest the difference."" ""An example will help illustrate how investing a raise can help build true long-term wealth. Suppose one receives a $5,000 annual raise early in one's career. If you simply invest that $5,000 annually into an investment account growing at a 10% annual rate, you will have accumulated over $822,000 in 30 years."" Monthly Savings: Best Cities To Retire on a Budget of $1,500 a Month Ally Bank recommends that 50-year-olds should have five times their annual earnings saved, while Fidelity is more aggressive with a recommendation of six times the salary. If you find that you've fallen behind in your retirement savings as money was diverted to other expenses -- such as college tuition for your children -- you can make a ""catch-up contribution."" Once you hit 50, you can make an extra contribution to a tax-advantaged retirement account each year. The Internal Revenue Service determines the amount, which is $6,500 in 2021. That is a per-person figure, so couples can double the contribution. Needs: How Much Do I Need To Retire? When you hit 50 -- or in the first few years of that decade -- your children might be out of the house and you might not need that four-bedroom Colonial anymore. It could be time to downsize. If you've owned your home for years, chances are you could be sitting on some equity you can put away for retirement. Or, with today's attractive interest rates, you could buy a less expensive home and slash your monthly mortgage payment. And if you haven't already done so, Walsh advised reviewing the fees you pay to maintain your retirement account. ""Fees impact every age, but as you get older your balance will start getting larger and those fees will really add up,"" he said. ""Let's face it -- fees are confusing and many average investors do not truly understand what fees they are paying. A fee of 1% or 2% may seem like a small number, but that is $5,000 to $10,000 a year if you have $500,000 saved up. Rather than paying high fees for your investments, consider using an active investing product that allows you to buy and sell investments on your own without paying commissions or an automated investing product that invests your money for you while charge no advisory fees.""

Fidelity, once again, is more aggressive and recommends eight times the amount. This is also the time to make a push toward paying off debt to enter retirement owing the minimum amount possible. Live within your means and pay off bills, especially high-interest credit card debt. If you don't, those monthly payments will eat into your retirement savings later on. Doing so will also increase your credit score and lower your credit utilization rate, which will make it easier to refinance your home at a lower interest rate. Discover: 10 Signs You're Not Saving Enough for Retirement Johnson said people within five years of retirement -- so no later than their early 60s -- should begin to minimize the risk to their retirement accounts. ""A large downturn in the market immediately preceding retirement can have devastating effects on an individual's standard of living in retirement. The exact time a person retires can have an enormous impact on the quality of their retirement if their assets are focused in the equity markets,"" he said. ""Take, for example, someone who retired at the end of 2008. If they were invested in the S&P 500, they would have seen their assets fall by 37% in one year. The five years prior to retirement can be considered the 'retirement red zone.' And, just as a football team can't afford to turn the ball over and fail to score points when inside the opponent's 20-yard line, the retirement investor can't afford a big downturn in the retirement red zone.""
