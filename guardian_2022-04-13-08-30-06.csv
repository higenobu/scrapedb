4/13/2022,"As if it didn’t hurt enough already. At the end of an astonishing and ultimately painful night at the Santiago Bernabéu, Thomas Tuchel complained that when he went to shake hands with Szymon Marciniak, he found the Polish referee laughing with the Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti. “I think this is very, very bad timing – and I told him that,” the Chelsea manager said, after words had been exchanged. That sensitivity was perhaps understandable after Chelsea had led 3-0, putting themselves within 10 minutes of the semi-final, only to concede twice and go out 5-4 on aggregate, leaving Tuchel to describe himself as “very disappointed and very proud at the same time”. The manager insisted that Chelsea had not deserved to be eliminated, citing luck, two mistakes with the ball being given away for the two they conceded, a lack of efficiency in front of goal and Real Madrid’s “pure individual quality” as the reason for their elimination. The refereeing, he implied, might have been another. Although he stopped short of suggesting that any headline decisions had been wrong, the Chelsea coach said he thought Marciniak should have checked the replay himself before ruling out Marcos Alonso’s goal for handball, rather than allow himself to be guided by the VAR official, Tomasz Kwiatkowski. “It’s not only today; it was like this in the first leg,” he started to say, when asked about the official, before pausing and noting: “Maybe I get problems [if I talk]. If you play against Real Madrid, you can maybe expect that not everybody has the courage. “I told him I am super disappointed that he doesn’t come and check [the footage of the handball] on his own. You should stay the boss and not give the decision to someone sitting in a chair, isolated from the atmosphere. He should stay in charge and check it on his own and explain it better. I thought we deserved more minutes [added on] at the end. Maybe it is too much to ask for in matches like this against this opponent. Listen, we had it in our hands and we were not lucky enough. “We played a fantastic match, we deserved what we had, we scored four goals and we had big chances to score even more. Unfortunately, we had two mistakes in crucial moments and against Real Madrid. We deserved to go through. But it was not meant to be. You need luck and it was not on our side.” Tuchel added: “I was disappointed that the referee had a good time with my colleague Ancelotti. I know that Carlo is a gentleman and a nice guy and when I go I see him smiling and laughing out loud with the opposition coach and I think this is very, very wrong time to do this at the end of 120 minutes of fight, when you give every last drop, to go [and see that]. I think this is very, very bad timing.”",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel ‘super disappointed’ with referee after Chelsea defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/13/thomas-tuchel-super-disappointed-with-referee-after-chelsea-defeat
4/13/2022,"The attorney general has referred the case of four protesters cleared of the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston to the court of appeal for legal direction. In a rare move, which cannot reverse the not guilty verdicts, Suella Braverman is to ask appeal judges for clarification on whether defendants can cite their human rights as a defence in a case of criminal damage. Jake Skuse, 33, Rhian Graham, 30, Milo Ponsford, 26 and Sage Willoughby, 22, were in January cleared of criminal damage despite admitting to helping crowds pull down the statue at an antiracism protest in Bristol in 2020. They told Bristol crown court they acted out of conscience, claiming the statue was offensive and a hate crime towards Bristol’s black community. The jury returned a not guilty verdict after they were asked to decide if they believed a conviction for criminal damage was a “proportionate interference” with the defendants’ rights to freedom of expression, thought and conscience – the last question in a “route to verdict” laid out by the judge, Peter Blair QC. In a move that effectively questions the directions given by Blair, Braverman’s office said she would ask the court of appeal to clarify whether defendants can use a human rights defence in a criminal damage case. She will also ask the court to consider whether it is up to juries to decide if a criminal conviction is a proportionate interference with a defendant’s human rights. “Trial by jury is an important guardian of liberty and critical to that are the legal directions given to the jury,” Braverman, who is also Conservative MP for Fareham, said. “It is in the public interest to clarify the points of law raised in these cases for the future. This is a legal matter which is separate from the politics of the case involved.” But Raj Chada, who represented Skuse, suggested there was indeed a political element to the decision to appeal against the case, and particularly around its timing. “This decision from the attorney general is extremely disappointing and should give everyone who cares about the integrity of our legal system cause for concern. Referrals such as this are very rare and must be made expeditiously. It is more than three months since the jury’s verdict in this case,” Chada said. “It is of serious concern that the public announcement of this decision coincides with and appears intended to deflect from the police decision to issue FPN [fixed-penalty] notices against the prime minister and the chancellor for unlawful lockdown parties. We appear to be seeing the real-time politicisation of jury trials to stoke up culture wars.” During the trial in December and January of this year at Bristol crown court, the four defendants variously admitted bringing ropes to the protest and tying them around the neck of the bronze statue, before helping crowds wrench it from its plinth and roll it to Bristol harbour, where it was thrown into the water. Willoughby, a carpenter, told the court he had targeted the statue of Colston “because he was a racist and a slave trader who murdered thousands and enslaved even more”.",News/Law,Colston Four acquittal to be referred to court of appeal,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/13/colston-four-acquittal-to-be-referred-to-court-of-appeal
4/13/2022,"A controversial multimillion pound tie-up between English cricket and the maker of Hula Hoops and Butterkist to sponsor family-friendly tournament the Hundred has backfired, after the advertising watchdog banned a promotional campaign for targeting junk food at children. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) struck a deal with KP Snacks to be the official sponsor of each of the teams participating in the Hundred, a new tournament designed to encourage young people to take up the game, which was first played last year. The tie-up was criticised by health campaigners and Simon Stevens, the outspoken former head of NHS England, who argued that the association with snacks from Skips and Nik Naks to McCoy’s ran counter to the fight to reduce the rising problem of childhood obesity. KP Snacks ran a campaign that included each of its brands sponsoring a team from across England and Wales participating in the competition. It included an email promotion, Instagram posts on the accounts of KP Snacks’ brands and a wider paid-for ad campaign on the Meta-owned social media site. The Advertising Standards Authority received two complaints – from the Children’s Food Campaign and Food Active – that the ads broke UK rules banning foods high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) being targeted at under-16s. The advertising watchdog’s investigation found that two elements of the campaign broke its rules. One was a co-branded email promotion to give away 1,000 cricket bats and balls that featured a “bright, colourful, cartoon-style” image of cricket players and McCoy’s branding. The other was an Instagram ad featuring Butterkist toffee popcorn – which has 51g of sugars per 100g – offering the chance to win tickets to watch Birmingham Phoenix play in the tournament. The ASA found that of the 29,276 recipients of the email campaign 1.3%, or 326, were identified as belonging to people 16 or under, a breach of UK ad rules. The watchdog also found that the Instagram Butterkist ad did not run with specific targeting criteria to stop it being seen by under-16s, as the other two Instagram ads had done. “We told the ECB and KP Snacks to take reasonable steps in future to ensure that HFSS product ads were not directed at children through the selection of media or the context in which they appeared,” said the ASA. A spokesperson for the Hundred said: “We are sorry that due to an internal error an email promoting a giveaway of free cricket bats and balls was sent to a number of under-16s as well as the adults it was intended to be sent to. While the email contained a logo of one of our partner’s brands, applicants were not required or encouraged to buy any products in order to apply for the bat and ball and the purpose of the competition was to get more people active. We are putting in place additional systems to ensure it does not happen again.” KP Snacks did not respond to a request for comment.",News/Society,English cricket on back foot after ad watchdog bans junk food campaign,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/13/english-cricket-on-back-foot-after-ad-watchdog-bans-junk-food-campaign
4/13/2022,"The costume designer Sandy Powell’s one-of-a-kind “autograph suit”, which was signed by more than 200 Hollywood celebrities and luminaries including Leonardo DiCaprio, Spike Lee and Donatella Versace, has been acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum. The suit, worn by Powell during the 2020 film awards season, was auctioned as part of a fundraising effort by Art Fund to save Prospect Cottage, the creative studio of Powell’s mentor and friend Derek Jarman. It was bought by Edwina Dunn, the chief executive of the educational charity The Female Lead, who has given it to the V&A. “I started the project as a fundraising venture to save Prospect Cottage, but there was always a sickening thought of ‘where is it going to end up?’,” Powell told the Guardian. “I really would have loved whoever bought it to donate it to a museum, so Edwina has granted my wish in a way. It’s ended up where it’s meant to be.” Powell wore the cream suit to events including the 2020 Critics’ Circle, Baftas and Oscar ceremonies, where she asked A-list celebrities to sign their name with a Sharpie across the suit’s fabric. Other signatories included Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johansson and Billie Eilish. “I’d received an Oscar nomination and a Bafta nomination for The Irishman. And one of your first thoughts, after ‘that’s nice’, is what am I going to wear?,” Powell said. “I had the idea of wearing something sustainable, and suddenly thought it’d be a fun idea to wear this to raise money … I just wore the same suit to everything I went to for a two-week period. Every party, every event.” Some parts of the suit were less signature-friendly than others. Richard E Grant had to kneel down on the red carpet to add his name, while Gwendoline Christie found herself signing the inside of Powell’s leg. “I let only women sign the bum,” Powell said. “Brad Pitt is in a secret spot under a lapel.” The multi-Oscar- and Bafta-winning costume designer, who has worked across theatre, dance and film, including on Shakespeare in Love and The Wolf of Wall Street, credits Jarman as one of the biggest influences on her career, having worked with him on her first feature film, Caravaggio, in 1985. She said: “He was the first film director I ever worked with and he pretty much kickstarted my career. I owed him a lot.” Prospect Cottage, a converted fisher’s hut on the windswept shores of Dungeness, is a site of pilgrimage for fans of Jarman’s work across the world. Powell’s suit joins highlights from the V&A’s National Collection of Performing Arts from Wednesday and is one of four star objects featured in the latest series of BBC Two’s Secret of the Museum, which airs on Wednesday night. Kate Bailey, the senior curator of theatre and performance at the V&A, said the suit was “an extraordinary object which is so rich in stories and creativity. It is wonderful to share this unique work with our visitors and provides such a fascinating insight into the performing arts industry.” Dunn said: “Sandy has been a passionate member of our celebrated Female Lead icons and when her suit came up for auction we purchased it as a tangible symbol of our believe that ‘we rise by lifting others’. “For me the suit represents a collective effort to make a difference, an expression of ‘paying it forward’ – together the signatories helped save Prospect Cottage, which will help young artists as an inspiring place for them to work.”",Arts/Art and design,V&A acquires ‘autograph suit’ signed by stars at Baftas and Oscars,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/costume-and-culture/2022/apr/13/va-acquires-sandy-powell-autograph-suit-signed-by-stars
4/13/2022,"Dominic Raab’s proposal to replace the Human Rights Act with a British bill of rights is not evidence-based and will diminish protections for individuals, MPs and peers have said. The criticisms by the joint committee on human rights (JCHR) are the latest directed at the planned changes, which the justice secretary has said will counter “wokery and political correctness” and expedite the deportation of foreign criminals. In a report published on Wednesday, the committee says that by placing greater restrictions on who can bring a human rights claim or reducing damages owed to a claimant because they are perceived as undeserving, the government would contravene the fundamental principle that human rights are universal. While Raab has said the changes will strengthen free speech – “the liberty that guards all of our other freedoms” – the JCHR claims it will weaken other rights, against which it is currently balanced, such as the right to privacy and to a fair trial. The JCHR chair, Harriet Harman, said: “The government’s case that human rights legislation is in serious need of reform is not proven. There is nothing in their consultation that would serve to strengthen the protections we currently have and much that would weaken them. “In many cases what is described as the strengthening of rights is simply tweaking what is already protected, while at the same time making it harder for people to actually enforce their rights.” The committee found that the right to jury trial in the new bill of rights was “symbolic” as there would be no change to the current limit on jury trial in England and Wales for serious offences. It said fears that UK courts were taking decisions that should be made by parliament were unfounded, rendering obsolete any need for change. The proposals, out for consultation until 19 April, would also weaken the current obligation for UK courts to take into account judgments from the European court of human rights (ECHR). In response, the committee says the number of cases brought against the UK in Strasbourg since the Human Rights Act became law in 1998 has fallen. It adds that if, as a result of changes, UK courts diverged from established interpretations of convention rights, it would lead to lengthy and costly litigation and – ironically – more cases presided over by the ECHR. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Our proposals will strengthen quintessentially British human rights, such as freedom of expression, while staying a party to the ECHR. “They will also prevent abuses of the system, adding a healthy dose of common sense and restore parliament’s rightful role as the ultimate decision-maker on laws impacting the UK population.”",News/Law,"Replacing Human Rights Act will weaken protections, say peers and MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/13/replacing-human-rights-act-will-weaken-protections-say-peers-and-mps
4/13/2022,"From frozen screens to the oblivious person on mute, the trials and tribulations of video calls became familiar challenges as the pandemic forced workers to communicate from their kitchen tables, makeshift offices and boxroom desks. Now scientists have revealed why we often end up raising our voices at our colleagues: as video quality deteriorates, we speak louder and alter our gestures in an attempt to compensate. “The gestures that we make while talking, as well as other visual signals such as facial expressions, are truly important and integrated aspects of how we communicate,” said Dr James Trujillo, the first author of the research at Radboud University Nijmegen, in the Netherlands. “If your Zoom connection is giving you poor video, remember to articulate both your speech and gestures.” He said previous research had shown that when we cannot hear someone well because of noise, we speak louder, while the team’s recent work had shown that when a video call is very noisy, people make their gestures more noticeable. “It seems that there is a general tendency for us to put more effort into our speech and gestures when our communication is disrupted by something, such as noise or a poor video connection,” he said. Writing in the Royal Society Open Science journal, Trujillo and colleagues reported how they analysed video calls between 20 pairs of participants. For each pair, participants sat in separate rooms and chatted to each other in casual, unscripted conversation over a Zoom-like video call for 40 minutes. Over the course of the call, the quality of the video was changed in 10 steps between excellent and completely blurred, with half of the pairs experiencing improving video quality over the call, and half having it deteriorate. The video quality during the call at each step was the same for both participants. The researchers tracked the gestures of participants and aspects of their speech during the calls. It revealed that as video quality deteriorated, participants initially reduced their arm and body movements while conversing, but as the quality deteriorated further, they moved them more. However, the rate, speed and size at which they gestured all increased as video quality initially fell but then decreased as it deteriorated further That, said Trujillo, suggested gestures were, at least initially, becoming bigger but “cleaner”. The team added that when gestures were not being used, speech was unaffected by decreases in visibility. But when gestures were used, volume increased by up to 5 decibels as video quality initially fell, and then remained at this higher level as video quality deteriorated further – in other words, when gestures ceased to be useful at all. Trujillo said the results showed communication was not just about speech but that, in the case of spoken language, it was an integrated system of visual and auditory signals that work together to convey meaning. “To compensate [for poorer video quality], people ‘exaggerate’ the form of their gestures in order to help their partner recognise the meaning of the gesture, even when they cannot see it as well as normal,” he said. “Although speaking louder probably doesn’t help, the fact that people do it shows how integrated these systems are, particularly since people only speak louder when gestures are present,” Trujillo added. “They know that the gestures being produced are vital to their communication, but their partner is going to have a harder time seeing them. So they increase the strength of the other signal – speech.”",News/Science,‘Can you hear me now?’ Study reveals why voices are raised on video calls,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/13/voices-raised-video-calls-study-can-you-hear-me-now
4/13/2022,"A third of GPs in England say they want to quit within five years, according to a regular survey which warns that clinical doctors are especially unhappy with the number of hours they work. The survey of 2,195 GPs undertaken in 2021 found 33% planned to leave “direct patient care” by 2026. The figure represents a return to levels last seen in 2015, after plans to quit peaked in 2018 when two in five GPs wanted to stop seeing patients within five years. GPs said they struggled with increasing workloads, long hours, greater demand from patients, insufficient time to feel as if they could do their jobs properly, paperwork and dealing with difficult patients. The average level of job satisfaction, measured between a high of seven and a low of one, decreased by 0.2 points from 4.5 in 2019 to 4.3 in 2021. GPs said they were especially displeased with the number of hours they had to work and a lack of recognition for good performance. Prof Kath Checkland, who led the 11th biannual GP worklife survey at the University of Manchester, said: “It is not really surprising that job satisfaction has dropped amongst GPs during the pandemic. “The fact that 16% of GPs under the age of 50 are thinking about leaving their jobs is worrying, and suggests that work is still needed to ensure that general practice is sustainable for the long term.” The rates were even higher among GPs over 50, with nearly two-thirds (61%) planning to stop working with patients within five years. Nearly three-quarters (70%) said they planned to reduce their working hours in the coming years, as did 37.9% of GPs under 50. However, over half of respondents (51%) said they were satisfied with their job overall, and most were happy with their co-workers and working environment. There was also a small decline in the number of hours part-time and full-time GPs worked a week for the second consecutive survey, from 40 hours in 2019 to 38.4 hours in 2021. The survey, which was completed by 2,227 GPs, is used by the Department of Health and Social Care to inform the doctors’ and dentists’ pay review body. The authors noted the survey took place in the middle of the pandemic, when GPs were grappling with “unprecedented” changes, including remote appointments, increased demand, critical media coverage and having to wear personal protective equipment.Richard Van Mellaerts, the executive officer for the England GP committee at the British Medicine Association, said: “The fact that 61% of GPs over 50 say they are likely to quit direct patient care within the next five years highlights the extent of the staffing crisis facing general practice. If these intentions come to fruition, this will represent a huge loss to the NHS and to patients of highly skilled and experienced GPs. “GPs and their teams are exhausted from the pandemic, struggling with a toxic combination of escalating patient demand at the same time as the number of fully qualified, full-time GPs has fallen significantly. The number of GPs in England has fallen every year since the government first pledged to increase the GP workforce by 5,000 and this survey shows that more could be set to leave if the government does not take action.”",News/Society,"Third of GPs in England want to quit within five years, survey finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/13/third-gps-england-want-quit-five-years-survey
4/13/2022,"More than one in eight privately rented homes in England pose a serious threat to people’s health and safety, costing the NHS about £340m a year, according to a report from a committee of MPs. It also uncovered evidence of unlawful discrimination, with an estimated one in four landlords unwilling to let to non-British passport holders. The public accounts committee’s findings come as tenants’ finances face a record squeeze, with higher rents and energy bill increases combining to pile more pressure on many households. In January the property website Rightmove said private rents in Britain were rising at the fastest rate on record, with the average advertised rent outside London almost 10% higher than a year earlier. In its report, the committee said it was “too difficult for renters to realise their legal right to a safe and secure home”, and that local authorities – constrained by a lack of support from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities – did not have the capability to provide them with proper protection. An estimated 11 million people rent privately in England, and the sector has doubled in size during the past two decades. Years of soaring house prices have meant that many people who want to buy their own home have been forced to stay in rented accommodation for years, in some cases with no prospect of ever being able to afford their own place in the area where they live. The committee’s report said an estimated 13% (589,000) of privately rented homes in England had at least one “category one” hazard – a serious threat to health and safety that landlords are legally obliged to address. These hazards could range from damp and mould or a risk of accidents – for example, from trips or falls, faulty wiring or parts of the building collapsing – to smoke alarms or carbon monoxide detectors that were missing or not working. Compliance with the legal minimum standards was inconsistent across England, with the proportion of properties with category one hazards ranging from 9% in London to 21% in Yorkshire and the Humber. The result, said the MPs, was “a ‘postcode lottery’ of tenant safety”. At the same time there was also evidence of unlawful discrimination in the sector, with an estimated 25% of landlords unwilling to let to non-British passport holders, and 52% unwilling to let to tenants who receive housing benefit. Yet only 10 landlords and letting agents have been banned by local authorities since 2016, while some councils inspect as few as 0.1% of their privately rented properties. The report said the department recognised the challenges within the sector and had committed to proposing reforms in a white paper due later this year. Meg Hillier MP, the committee’s chair, said: “Unsafe conditions, overcrowding, harassment, discrimination and dodgy evictions are still a huge issue in the private rented sector.”",Lifestyle/Money,"One in eight privately rented homes in England pose threat to health, MPs say",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/13/one-in-eight-privately-rented-homes-england-pose-threat-health-mps-say
4/13/2022,"Liam Neeson made a surprise appearance in the hit comedy series Derry Girls on Tuesday night. The Oscar-nominated Northern Irish actor, 69, played a police inspector in the returning Channel 4 sitcom, questioning the show’s main characters about a burglary at their school. The show’s creator Lisa McGee tweeted after the episode that they had a code name for Neeson on set which was “the big fella”, a secret she admitted was arguably quite “easily cracked”. “What an honour to have him in our wee show,” she added. “Our very own Northern Star.” The show, set in Derry in the 1990s, returned for the first episode of its third and final season on Tuesday. McGee has previously confirmed that the third series of the comedy will be the last.

McGee is quoted as saying at the premiere event: “I probably wouldn’t exist as a comedy writer [without Channel 4]. “I had a career writing drama but they really invested in my voice as a comedy writer which is what I am now most known for.” It comes as the government announced plans to privatise the broadcaster, which has been publicly owned since it was founded in 1982 and is funded by advertising.",Arts/Television & radio,Liam Neeson makes surprise cameo in new series of Derry Girls,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/12/liam-neeson-makes-surprise-appearance-in-new-series-of-derry-girls
4/13/2022,"Patients are being put at risk in the UK because very few sexually transmitted infection (STI) tests offered online meet official standards, experts have warned. The NHS provides free in-person tests for STIs via its network of sexual health and genitourinary medicine clinics. Patients can also order tests via the internet from both NHS-commissioned and private providers, a practice that has become increasingly popular during the pandemic. However, new research in the Sexually Transmitted Infections journal published by the BMJ found that few online STI test services meet national recommended standards, with independent sector providers the least likely to be compliant. Online tests involve the user ordering a kit and either self-sampling by posting the specimen for laboratory analysis, or self-testing by interpreting the test themselves. National guidelines are provided by the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV and the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine looked on Google and Amazon in June 2020 and found 13 services that offered self-test kits and 18 which offered self-sample kits, while two laboratories serviced several providers. All 13 self-test providers and 13 of the 18 self-sample providers were privately run, while all but one of the self-sample providers were from the UK. The commercial self-sample providers, which advertised to those with symptoms, did not differentiate by STI symptom severity, and eight – seven private and one NHS-commissioned provider – offered no advice on accessing preventive treatment after exposure to HIV as recommended. Self-test providers did not appear to offer any form of order of treatment for patients and five offered tests that were intended for professional use only. The research found there was often no health promotion information given, inappropriate infections were tested for, incorrect specimen types were used and there was little advice on what to do after a diagnosis. Eleven self-test providers had at least one of their tests CE-marked, suggesting that the product conformed to European health, safety and environmental protection standards. Two claimed World Health Organization approval and one claimed US Food and Drug Administration accreditation. One self-test provider marked its chlamydia and gonorrhoea tests with an NHS logo, describing itself as an NHS provider, but it was unclear if these products had been endorsed by the NHS. And while UK Accreditation Service accreditation was claimed for self-sample kits, there were no details of the specific laboratory service that had been accredited. The research concluded “very few online providers” met national STI test standards. It added: “The proliferation of providers that do not follow guidelines, in particular for-profit sites, jeopardises these advantages and puts users at risk. If current trends continue, online testing usage will increase, resulting in more online providers as demand rises. “Regulatory change is required to ensure that the standard of care received online meets national guidelines to protect patients and the wider population from the repercussions of underperforming or inappropriate tests. “If we do not act now, patients will continue to receive suboptimal care with potentially significant adverse personal, clinical and public health implications.”",News/Society,"Non-compliant online STI tests put patients at risk, experts warn",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/12/non-compliant-online-sti-tests-put-patients-at-risk-experts-warn
