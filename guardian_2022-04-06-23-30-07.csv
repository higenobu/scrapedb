4/6/2022,"The job of keeping the UK’s electricity and gas flowing will be returned to public control by 2024, under government plans for the effective nationalisation of a division of National Grid. A new public body, the “Future Systems Operator” will have responsibility for planning and managing energy distribution, with a focus on the challenges posed by decarbonisation. The government said the plan, announced on the eve of the publication of its long-awaited energy strategy, would “drive progress towards net zero while maintaining energy security and minimising costs for consumers.” BEIS said the National Grid, a stock market-listed company since 1995, would be “appropriately compensated” in a transaction that will see the government take control of its Electricity System Operator, the part of the business that keeps the lights on. Gas distribution assets will also be taken into state ownership. The National Grid’s chief executive, John Pettigrew, said National Grid “has a critical role to play in the decarbonisation of the economy to reach net zero, while continuing to ensure security of supply at the lowest cost to consumers.” He said: “We have been working closely with government, industry and the regulator to create a Future System Operator that enables long-term holistic thinking, drives progress towards net zero, and lays the foundations for the regulatory reform necessary to deliver a clean, fair and affordable energy transition. “We will continue to work closely with all relevant parties to ensure a smooth transition, subject to parliamentary approval and conclusion of the transaction process.” The Prospect union said it was vital that the skills and experience of people who work in the National Grid ESO division were retained. “Workers need certainty on exactly what the new ownership model will look like, and on their future prospects,” it said. “The government and National Grid should engage with unions to provide commitments and certainty as soon as possible.” The effective nationalisation of the ESO division comes just three years after it was formally separated from the rest of National Grid, albeit within the same corporate group. The ESO manages supply and demand on the Grid to prevent interruption of supply, keeping the lights on. The Grid houses the infrastructure assets that support the system.",News/Business,National Grid to be partially nationalised to help reach net zero targets,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/06/national-grid-to-be-partially-nationalised-to-help-reach-net-zero-targets
4/6/2022,"Tributes have been paid to a British lawyer and his nine-year-old son killed in a landslide while on holiday in Australia. Mehraab Nazir, 49, had been hiking with his family in the Wentworth Pass area of the Blue Mountains, a national park west of Sydney, on Monday when they were caught in the rockslide. His body and that of his nine-year-old son was recovered the next morning. His wife is still in a critical condition in an intensive care unit, while another son, aged 14, has undergone surgery and is in a stable condition. The couple’s 15-year-old daughter, who walked from the scene, is under observation in hospital. Nazir, a graduate from the University of Exeter, was a partner at the law firm Watson Farley & Williams based in its Singapore office, where he worked as a finance lawyer specialising in international transactions having reportedly moved from London more than 10 years ago. The company said: “It is with the greatest sadness that we must confirm that our dear friend and colleague Mehraab Nazir, a partner in our Singapore office, tragically lost his life in a landslide in Australia earlier this week alongside his young son. We will be remembering and honouring Mehraab. However, with the surviving members of the family in serious conditions or in shock, we ask that you respect their privacy and grief at this incredibly difficult time.” It was reported the family are Zoroastrians. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported a message on the Zoroastrian Association of New South Wales Facebook page, which described their deaths as an “immense tragedy”. It is understood relatives have arrived in Sydney. Dominic Perrottet, NSW premier said the incident was “tragic” and he would be seeking advice as to whether the walking track should have been open, given recent heavy rain. “These tragedies occur too often so anything we can do to keep people safe, we will,” Perrottet told ABC. “Obviously, the Blue Mountains is a place where people love to go trekking. It’s one of the wonders of the world but when those tragedies occur, it would be remiss of any government not to act.” After the bodies were removed, the NSW Department of Environment and Heritage announced that the area was closed to the public until further notice and a “comprehensive review” would be undertaken. The British High Commission said: “We are supporting the family of a British couple and their children following an incident in the Blue Mountains. Our staff in Australia are in contact with local police.”",News/Australia news,British lawyer who died with son in Blue Mountains named as Mehraab Nazir,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/british-lawyer-who-died-with-son-in-blue-mountains-named-as-mehraab-nazir
4/6/2022,"The head of British Cycling’s Olympic and Paralympic programme has signed a letter calling for a rule change that would stop transgender cyclist Emily Bridges from competing in women’s events. Sara Symington, who rode at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics and is now one of the most senior figures in British sport, is among 76 woman who have urged cycling’s governing body, the UCI, to rescind its rules for trans women to “guarantee fairness for female athletes”. Trans women are allowed to race in the female category if they reduce their testosterone levels to below 5 nmol/L for at least 12 months. However, the UCI president, David Lappartient, said last week that the sport’s rules were “probably not enough” to balance fairness and inclusivity. In their letter, the signatories – which include multiple Olympians, academics and researchers – say those words must now be matched by immediate action. “We believe that rule 13.5.015 does not guarantee female athletes ‘fair and meaningful competition that displays and rewards the fundamental values of the meaning of the sport’,” the letter states. “We believe that the rule is asymmetric and thus discriminatory in that it advantages only biological male athletes by providing them greater opportunity to compete and enjoy the rewards of sport at its highest level.” The letter says that unless the UCI can provide “robust scientific evidence that the rule guarantees fairness for female athletes”, it should rescind 13.5.015 immediately “and implement eligibility criteria for the female category that is based on female biological characteristics”. The notable intervention comes less than a week after Bridges, who set a national junior men’s record over 25 miles in 2018, was temporarily barred from her first race in the women’s category at the National Omnium Championships last Saturday. Officially, Bridges was stopped due to a dispute over eligibility but, as the Guardian first reported, several women were planning to boycott the event if Bridges competed. The letter says: “Recently, female athletes in the UK have shown you that they were willing to boycott their own National Championship competition to get the UCI and British Cycling to hear their concerns about fairness in their sport. That is how seriously female athletes are taking this issue and we greatly respect what our sisters were willing to sacrifice to have their voices heard. We are saddened that this should ever have been necessary.” Other British signatories of the letter include Yvonne McGregor, who won a track cycling bronze at Sydney 2000, and Mandy Bishop, the 1982 world road race champion. Boris Johnson added his voice to the debate on Thursday saying: “I don’t think biological males should be competing in female sporting events. Maybe that’s a controversial thing to say, but it just seems to me to be sensible. “If that puts me in conflict with some others, then we have got to work it all out. It doesn’t mean I’m not immensely sympathetic to people who want to change gender, to transition, and it’s vital we give people the maximum love and support in making those decisions.”",Sport/Sport,Head of Team GB Olympic cycling calls for transgender rule change,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/06/head-of-team-gb-olympic-cycling-transgender-rule-change-uci
4/6/2022,"A woman accused of murdering her five-year-old son has told a jury his stepfather violently attacked her “beautiful, happy boy” two days before he was found dead in a river. Angharad Williamson, 31, claimed her 6ft 4in partner, John Cole, 40, punched 3ft 5in Logan Mwangi twice in the stomach, causing him to land hard on the floor. Williamson told the jury at Cardiff crown court that after Logan got up a 14-year-old boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, swept Logan off his feet and pushed the child’s head into the floor. Cole, 40, Williamson, 30, and the 14-year-old boy deny murdering Logan, whose body was found in a river close to his home in the south Wales village of Sarn on 31 July last year. He had suffered more than 50 injuries including severe internal damage to the stomach area. Williamson claimed Cole attacked Logan after the couple had an argument over damage to a stereo. She said: “It escalated very quickly. I was talking to Jay [John] in the kitchen as that’s where my stereo was and straight away he said: ‘It could have been Logan.’ “I said: ‘Why are you always blaming Logan?’ He said: ‘Stop shouting, when women shout people call the police.’ I said: ‘That’s double standards because you shout all the time, why can’t I shout?’ “Jay said Logan was smirking and he said to him: ‘You love it when me and your mum argue.’ He pulled Logan into the hallway; he tried to talk to him and Logan stuttered and wouldn’t talk to Jay. “I said: ‘Leave him alone’ but he said: ‘No I’ve had enough, he needs to talk to me’. Logan stuttered again and Jay punched him twice in the stomach and it knocked him on to his bum and he hit his elbows on the floor.” Williamson said Cole blocked her from helping Logan, who got up. She told the court that Cole said to the youth: “If he flinches again or stutters, sweep him.” Williamson said this was a martial arts move, sweeping an opponents’ legs away. Logan’s mother said the youth obeyed and swept the younger boy off his feet and pushed his head to the ground. Williamson previously told the jury Cole was “strict” with Logan and would leave him standing in a “naughty corner” for up to 30 minutes at a time. She said: “I thought Jay was trying to help the family, get structure in. I didn’t realise how strict he was and how scared Logan was.” Cole has admitted taking Logan’s body from the flat in the early hours and leaving it next to the river but says he does not know how the boy died. Williamson denies any involvement in her son’s death, saying she slept the whole night through and woke to find him missing. At the start of her evidence she described Logan as the “perfect baby”. She said: “I loved the bones of that boy. Logan was my little sidekick. We did everything together, he was such beautiful a happy little boy. “He was so clever, he wanted to explore the world and see what it was about and I was so proud, so proud.” ",News/UK news,"Logan Mwangi: stepfather punched boy twice days before body found, jury told",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/06/stepfather-punched-boy-logan-mwangi
4/6/2022,"Moscow will fight attempts to seize Russian property abroad in courts around the world, the former president Dmitry Medvedev has said. Medvedev, who advises Vladimir Putin on national security matters, said in a post on Telegram on Wednesday that Russian businesses whose assets were subject to sanctions would take legal action in the US, EU and elsewhere. “Our opponents ... should understand that they will face a large number of cases in courts. Both in the national courts of the United States and Europe and in international courts,” wrote Medvedev. Since Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine in late February the US, EU, UK and other allies have targeted sanctions at a series of Russia’s richest businesspeople and companies, ranging from state-controlled banks to arms manufacturers. Medvedev served as president between 2008 and 2012, before Putin reassumed the presidency. Medvedev is deputy chair of Russia’s Security Council, which is headed by Putin and advises the president on national security, and has used the Telegram to issue a mixture of threats and comments about sanctions on Russia since the invasion of Ukraine. Many of the sanctions against Russian interests have included asset freezes. Trophy assets that have been affected include company stakes, such the billionaire Roman Abramovich’s shares in Chelsea football club and in London-listed steelmaker Evraz. There is also a growing list of superyachts and planes linked to oligarchs that have been prevented from leaving to more friendly ports. In the UK an asset freeze prevents the owners of assets such as land, buildings, company shares or artworks from gaining any economic benefit from them, including via their sale. However, those assets are not legally confiscated. Russia’s government has in the past proven adept at using the courts of other countries. In one notable case the Russian state successfully pursued Sergei Pugachev, a former senior Kremlin official who ran an election campaign for Putin, in London courts to claim ownership of UK property Russia claimed was bought with stolen funds. In his Telegram post, Medvedev acknowledged the courts systems in the US and Europe had “a significant degree of independence”, but complained that sanctions against Russian businesspeople were like the Spanish Inquisition.",News/World news,Putin adviser promises legal action against attempts to seize Russian assets,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/putin-adviser-medvedev-legal-battles-attempts-seize-russian-assets
4/6/2022,"‘If this guy was walking down the street, you wouldn’t want to talk to him,” says Selina Scott, watching footage of herself in her 80s-presenting heyday interviewing Jimmy Savile in his “flirtatious” mode. Young Selina masks her discomfort with a professional charm and veneer of bonhomie (“The camera lies,” she notes now) as Savile skates ever closer to the boundary between what was then acceptable banter from a celebrity in the company of a hot blond – an already generously allotted area – and outright creepiness. He is, as the two-part Netflix documentary Jimmy Savile: A British Horror Story shows time and again, the very definition of a predator hiding in plain sight. A decade on from his death and the investigation – which alas succeeded rather than preceded the passing – into what turned out to be crimes extending over half a century and more than 50 children’s homes, schools and hospitals around Britain, the story is no less shocking or confounding. Somehow, the meticulous piecing together of the Savile phenomenon by the documentary makers only makes it more so. The nearly three-hour running time is a measured, relentless march of contemporary footage, present-day interviews with people who worked with or knew him, the investigative journalists who eventually unearthed the evidence behind the rumours – the years and years of rumours – and one of his victims – from the years and years of victims. It moves chronologically through his career, from the early days as a DJ through to the jewel in the BBC’s crown as Top of the Pops and Jim’ll Fix It presenter, and on to an enjoyable non-retirement as a national treasure in perennial demand for TV guest appearances. All of it bolstered, of course, by his constant work raising millions for charity – most famously for Stoke Mandeville hospital and other such institutions. The latter gave him an entree into the establishment, and friendships with everyone from then prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who admired his can-do spirit, to Prince Charles, who saw him as a conduit to the working man and spent years in correspondence with him seeking advice on public relations and the best way to use royalty’s influence for the good of under-acknowledged services. It, effectively, made him invincible. Rumours of his true predilections abounded, but there was never any evidence. Journalist Meirion Jones eventually found victims willing to testify, despite their enduring vulnerability, but his Newsnight investigation into the by-then late Savile’s rape and abuse of countless children and adults was infamously pulled at the last minute, apparently to save the BBC embarrassment. Savile himself seemed almost unable to believe his luck, and couldn’t resist pushing it. Or maybe it was the Catholic in him that couldn’t resist the urge towards confession. He would frequently “joke” about the dark forces secretly animating him, or the sins he hoped his fundraising would cancel out at the pearly gates, or how “my case is coming up next Thursday!” How Parkinson, Bragg, Bough and countless other interviewers laughed. In one extraordinary moment, a reporter spending a week with him as he runs the length of the country for charity asks if the running is a way of punishing himself. “No,” replies Savile, devoid of his usual tics and catchphrases. “The only time you need to punish yourself is when you’re with young ladies … because you’re such a villain and you’re not kind to them and you squeeze them and make them go ‘Ouch!’ and things like that.” It dumbfounds the viewer 30-odd years on as thoroughly as it does his companion. A British Horror Story passes relatively lightly over the possible causes of Savile’s depravity. In a way that is fair enough – it would always be speculative – but it doesn’t dwell on his profoundly close and strange relationship with his mother (though it shows Andrew Neil asking him why he sat with her body for five days after she died), which even if not explanatory is surely revealing in some measure. It also omits any mention of the claims about his necrophilia: perhaps for legal reasons, perhaps to make the programme more palatable for Netflix’s international audiences, perhaps so as not to strain viewers’ credulity about our own credulity towards the man who, in the lead police investigator’s words, “groomed a nation”. It does, however, give space, dignity and the last word to one of his victims: Sam Brown, whom he repeatedly abused at Stoke Mandeville hospital. She provides a welter of horrifying detail that the makers carefully embed without sensationalism but which bring home the absolute and fathomless human misery he spread, unchecked. Savile believed in hell and spoke often – without naming his debits – of his hope that his charity work would balance the books. Never. Let us hope hell exists.",Arts/Television & radio,Jimmy Savile: A British Horror Story review – a welter of devastating detail,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/06/jimmy-savile-a-british-horror-story-review-a-welter-of-devastating-detail
4/6/2022,"Itook this photograph last year in northern Malawi. It’s part of a project for Norwegian Church Aid, an NGO that documents modern slavery in the mining industry. It’s very hard to believe your own eyes when you see what this actually looks like. These miners work in dangerous conditions with very little protective gear. Their salaries are awful and their contracts are unstable, not to mention the terrible health and environmental impacts of such polluting work. But mining is the only option available to the local people: they have no other choice. I stayed in a tent nearby, waking up at 4am to begin the hour-long walk towards the pits. By the time we arrived, the miners had already been working for hours. One person we visited had been paralysed and could no longer work, which meant he could no longer pay his bills. A few weeks after I left, another miner died. Accidents are becoming more frequent because the mines are collapsing. The working conditions there were among the worst I have ever seen. My visit was just weeks before the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, where all the world leaders assembled to talk about facing up to the impact of coal on the environment. But while they talked, this was the reality on the ground. The damage of coal is not just the environmental impact of emissions when it is burned, it’s also how dangerous the production process is for those in the mines. What struck me about this photograph were the contrasts. The beauty of the landscape offsets the cruelty of the scene. The greenery of the hills just stands to highlight the darkness of the coal. And the gentle morning light hitting this man, Zikani Musafili, illuminates his expression of deep sorrow staring straight at the viewer. I like the compositional quality of the outstretched hand – this chance moment really changes the image. I always want my photographs to build a relationship between the subject and the viewer. I want to be close to people in difficult situations but in a dignified way, and allow others the chance of experiencing that closeness. I take these photos to try to make a difference; to raise awareness of working conditions, to support people in any legal action they take, and to help them get compensation when something goes wrong. Perhaps it’s an old-fashioned view, but I think photographs should try and change things. You document the world and its ills so people can put an end to things that shouldn’t be happening. I didn’t choose to become an NGO photographer. The local paper I worked for in Norway closed its Oslo office, leaving me without a job. I was forced to make a change, but it worked out really well for me. Being in a campaigning organisation rather than a newspaper, it feels as though the gap between taking a photograph and it making a difference is somehow smaller. The decline of the newspaper industry concerns me. I was not the only one to lose my job. Nowadays, lots of the best work is done by freelancers working on specific projects and developing their own ideas, which they are then funded to pursue. The day-to-day work of photojournalism isn’t as strong as it was. But the best work being made now is better than ever: it just happens in different places and in different ways. I’m more eager to make this work than I ever was. I have lost none of my hunger, and experience has given me skills I did not have when I started out. Experience is a good thing - sometimes it feels as if it isn’t valued highly enough. Employing young people is great, but there are things you learn over a long career that you can’t pick up straight off the bat. I will never stop hating taking a bad photo.

4/6/2022,"The final days of Kurt Cobain, the rock star whose anguish and anti-establishment stance spoke to millions of generation X teenagers, are to be dramatised by the Royal Opera House (ROH). Cobain, who killed himself at his Seattle home in April 1994 at the age of 27, is the subject of Last Days, an opera adapted from Gus Van Sant’s 2005 film of the same name. The acclaimed movie, which centred on a young musician named Blake, was loosely based on Cobain’s last days and hours. It depicted the fictional star’s descent into pain, depression, isolation and drug-taking before he killed himself. Cobain’s devoted fans were distraught at his death, mystifying older opinion-formers who had failed to register his appeal and influence. More than 30m copies of Nevermind, the 1991 album written by Cobain for Nirvana, in which he was guitarist, singer and songwriter, have been sold worldwide. Conspiracy theories over Cobain’s death were widespread despite earlier suicide attempts, a history of drug use and a rambling suicide note. Excerpts were read by his wife, the punk singer Courtney Love, at a vigil in Seattle after his body was found, attended by thousands of fans. The opera has been composed by Oliver Leith, the ROH’s 31-year-old composer-in-residence, with the libretto by Matt Copson. Directed by Copson and Anna Morrissey, it is due to be staged in October in the ROH’s Linbury Theatre. The opera “plunges into the torment that created a modern myth”, the ROH said. Blake, its central character, has recently returned home after a spell in rehab. “But he is haunted by objects, visitors and memories distracting him from his true purpose – self-destruction”. Leith, a “massive” Nirvana fan, said opera was a fitting vehicle for the subject of Last Days. Cobain was “an archetypal story – operas deal well in those”. Van Sant had not sensationalised his death, he added. “We know it is coming. It is used as a lens through which we see everyday somnambulistic life heightened. For example, telling a delivery person to ‘come back another day’ is loaded with tragedy. I think opera also raises the stakes of the quotidian.” Leith was four when Cobain died, “but the music soundtracked my teens. It’s some of the first music I learned to play on the guitar. “I owe a lot of how I now make music to the sound of grunge from that time – I had never really thought about where my experimental mess and repetitions had come from.” He said he hoped the opera would appeal to a wide range of people, not just Nirvana fans. It was about the “inevitable death of a celebrity. It could be any star now”. Last Days was announced as part of the ROH’s 2022-2023 season, which includes 20 new opera and ballet productions, nine world premieres and three UK premieres. As well as classic operas by composers such as Puccini, Mozart and Verdi, the ROH is staging the UK premiere of Least Like the Other – a portrait of Rosemary Kennedy, the older sister of President John F Kennedy who was lobotomised at the age of 23. Another opera, History of the Present, marks the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement by telling the story of ordinary lives still suffering collective trauma from the Troubles.

4/6/2022,"Pinterest is to block all climate misinformation, as the image-focused social network seeks to limit the spread of false and misleading claims. Under the new policy the site is committing to take down content that distorts or denies the facts of the climate crisis, whether posted as adverts or normal “organic” content. Pinterest is defining misinformation broadly: the company will take down content that denies the existence or effects of climate change or its human causes, as well as content that “misrepresents scientific data” in order to erode trust in climate science and harmful, false or misleading content about natural disasters and extreme weather events. “Pinterest believes in cultivating a space that’s trusted and truthful for those using our platform,” said Sarah Bromma, the company’s head of policy. “This bold move is an expansion of our broader misinformation guidelines, which we first developed in 2017 to address public health misinformation, and have since updated to address new and emerging issues as they come to the forefront. The expanded climate misinformation policy is yet another step in Pinterest’s journey to combat misinformation and create a safe space online.” The company has made a concerted effort for years to stand out from its social media peers with content guidelines that attempt to limit various categories of misinformation. Where Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg famously argued that technology companies should not be in the business of judging what is true, Pinterest takes the general stance that dangerous or damaging falsehoods are not welcome on its platform. As well as simply banning various forms of misinformation entirely, preventing users from posting falsehoods about vaccination or Covid, the company has also deliberately limited its own tools. Users who search on the site for many health-related terms, such as “vaccines” or “cancer cure”, are not given normal results, instead being directed to health advice posted on the platform from organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Vaccine Safety Net. Michael Khoo, who heads the anti-disinformation unit at Friends of the Earth, welcomed Pinterest’s latest move and called on others to follow suit. “Climate disinformation on digital platforms is a serious threat to the public support needed to solve the climate crisis,” he said. “Pinterest has demonstrated great leadership by creating a community standard that includes a definition of climate misinformation, and we will continue to press all platforms for transparency and reporting on their actions. We encourage others to take note of Pinterest’s efforts to reduce climate change disinformation.”",News/Technology,Pinterest announces ban on all climate misinformation,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/06/pinterest-announces-ban-on-all-climate-misinformation
