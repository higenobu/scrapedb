4/21/2022,"WASHINGTON — Russia’s halting efforts to conduct electromagnetic warfare in Ukraine show how important it is to quickly respond, and immediately shut down, such attacks, Pentagon experts said Wednesday. But the U.S. needs to get much better at its own EW rapid response, they said during the C4ISRNET Conference Wednesday — and can learn a lot from how the private sector has handled these situations. Brig. Gen. Tad Clark, director of the Air Force’s electromagnetic spectrum superiority directorate, said modern wars will increasingly involve electromagnetic warfare, particularly to shape the battlefield when conflicts begin. Dave Tremper, director of electronic warfare for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, pointed to SpaceX’s ability last month to swiftly stymie a Russian effort to jam its Starlink satellite broadband service, which was keeping Ukraine connected to the Internet. SpaceX founder Elon Musk steered thousands of Starlink terminals to Ukraine after an official sent him a tweet asking for help keeping the besieged country online. “The next day [after reports about the Russian jamming effort hit the media], Starlink had slung a line of code and fixed it,” Tremper said. “And suddenly that [Russian jamming attack] was not effective anymore. From [the] EW technologist’s perspective, that is fantastic … and how they did that was eye-watering to me.” The government, on the other hand, has a “significant timeline to make those types of corrections” as it muddles through analyses of what happened, decides how to fix it and gets a contract in place for the fix. “We need to be able to have that agility,” Tremper said. “We need to be able to change our electromagnetic posture to be able to change, very dynamically, what we’re trying to do without losing capability along the way.” Redundancy is also critical so the U.S. could keep operating on another system if an EW attack succeeded at knocking one out, Tremper said. The U.S. needs to think a lot more innovatively when it comes to building new EW equipment, Clark said. It won’t be enough to just buy upgraded versions of legacy systems, he said — the U.S. has to come up with new systems that allow for much greater resilience and speed. This includes incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning into next-generation systems to be able to respond faster, he said. Increased use of digital engineering can also help the military model new equipment with a computer and work out the kinks before going through the time-consuming typical acquisition and testing process. Clark said the Air Force’s in-development Compass Call, the EC-37B, is a prime example of how digital engineering is transforming how the service approaches new electromagnetic warfare capabilities. Software coders and engineers are working with Compass Call operators on the ground to figure out creative ways to jam enemy signals, Clark said. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has taught the U.S. a great deal about the sophistication and reliability of Russian equipment, they said, and their troops’ ability to carry out missions in a synchronized way. In particular, Tremper said, it has shown how important it is to properly train the personnel assigned to carry out electromagnetic warfare operations. Trying to carry out EW while moving forward inside the territory you’re invading, and not in a secure location, makes it even trickier. “It’s a very hard problem, if you don’t have well-trained operators,” Tremper said. “The degree of coordination and synchronization of these types of operations is such that the undertrained operator will have a harder time pulling off those types of events successfully.” Tremper said the Pentagon expected a “much stronger” EW showing from Russia — but cautioned that isn’t to say all of Russia’s efforts have failed.",World/Defense News,SpaceX shut down a Russian electromagnetic warfare attack in Ukraine last month — and the Pentagon is taking notes,https://news.yahoo.com/spacex-shut-down-russian-electromagnetic-190254556.html
4/21/2022,"Tennessee death row inmate Oscar Franklin Smith has chosen a double bacon cheeseburger, a deep-dish apple pie and vanilla bean ice cream as his last meal before his looming execution, the Tennessee Department of Correction reported Wednesday. Smith, 72, is slated to die by lethal injection Thursday night at Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville. The meal will be delivered to him Thursday, TDOC spokesperson Dorinda Carter said. Death row inmates typically get $20 toward a special meal before they are executed. Smith was moved out of his cell on death row late Monday night and into a cell next to the execution chamber for a three-day period known as ""death watch."" During deathwatch, the 72 hours leading up to an execution, ""strict guidelines are implemented to maintain the security and control of the offender and to maintain safe and orderly operations of the prison,"" according to TDOC.

Their brutal deaths took place inside a home on Lutie Court in Nashville's Woodbine neighborhood. Smith, a former machinist from Robertson County, shot his estranged wife in the neck then stabbed her several times. He shot her eldest son in the left eye and then in the upper chest and left torso. Her younger son was stabbed in the neck and abdomen. At the time of the killings, Smith was separated from his wife. The couple shared twins, who were age 3 at the time of their mother's killing. Co-workers said Smith threatened to kill her on at least 12 occasions between June and August 1989. Smith told one he threatened to kill the boys because he said she was better to them than she was to his twin children. Smith has denied his involvement in the killings. Gov. Bill Lee announced Tuesday he would not intervene to stop the execution. “After thorough consideration of Oscar Smith’s request for clemency and an extensive review of the case, the State of Tennessee’s sentence will stand, and I will not be intervening,"" Lee wrote in an emailed statement. He is one of six prisoners scheduled to be executed by the state this year.

4/21/2022,"Marjorie Taylor Greene is going to appear in court on Friday. The media will be there, too, and she’s furious about it. U.S. District Court Judge Amy Totenberg ruled earlier this week that an effort to disqualify the conspiracy theorist from running for reelection over her alleged role in the attack on the Capitol last Jan. 6 can proceed. The group who filed the challenge, Free Speech for People, is alleging that Greene is in violation of the 14th Amendment, which states that if someone took an oath to defend the Constitution and then “engaged in insurrection or rebellion,” they can’t serve in Congress.

Greene seems a little worried, perhaps because she’s built her entire career on pushing lies and unfounded conspiracy theories — from Jewish-funded space lasers starting the California wildfires to the 2020 election being stolen — and has little experience telling the truth, which she’ll now have to do lest she open herself up to perjury charges. “You want to talk about it? It’s a big lie,” she said recently on One America News. “They want to talk about the big lie, this is the big lie and it’s destroying democracy.” Greene grew even more animated about the media presence in the courtroom. “I really hope you guys get a camera in that courtroom,” she continued. “You know what the Democrats and the media are going to do: They’re going to click and cut and paste so they can sell a lie on their networks every night.” Greene talking about “destroying democracy” is pretty rich. Rolling Stone reported last fall that Greene was one of several lawmakers who participated in the planning of the “Stop the Steal” rally that preceded the riot at the Capitol. She’s since valorized those who stormed the Capitol in attempt to stop the certification of the 2020 election results. “If you think about what our Declaration of Independence says, it says to overthrow tyrants,” she said in October. Greene made the same argument against the media’s presence in the courtroom on The Jennis Ellis Show, hosted by Trump’s former election attorney. “It’s absurd what they are claiming and lying about,” she said on Tuesday. “They’re going to allow the press in the courtroom. They’re going to allow the whole thing to be videoed live. … You know what that’s going to look like. The Democrats and the nasty mainstream media … are going to be able to twist and turn and clip out any little piece they want.” Marge getting scared for court Friday: “They’re going to allow the press in the courtroom. They’re going to allow the whole thing to be videoed live. They’re going to be able to clip out 😁any little piece they want of the horrible things .. they’re going to say about me.” pic.twitter.com/PJq4QpBh6u — Ron Filipkowski 🇺🇦 (@RonFilipkowski) April 19, 2022 Greene tried to block the effort to get her booted from the ballot earlier this month, arguing that the move is unconstitutional while “vigorously” denying that she “aided and engaged in insurrection.” Judge Totenberg didn’t buy it. “This case involves a whirlpool of colliding constitutional interests of public import,” the judge, who was appointed by President Obama, wrote. “The novelty of the factual and historical posture of this case — especially when assessed in the context of a preliminary injunction motion reviewed on a fast track — has made resolution of the complex legal issues at stake here particularly demanding.” U.S. District Court Judge Richard Myers II, who was appointed by Trump, last week ruled in favor of Madison Cawthorn as the North Carolina representative moved to block a similar effort to disqualify him from Congress for his alleged involvement in the events of last Jan. 6. Cawthorn, like Greene, was mentioned in Rolling Stone‘s report about the organization of the rally that preceded the riot. Greene wasn’t as lucky as Cawthorn, but it will likely be hard to prove that she, or any of the other lawmakers who may have helped incite the riot, actually violated the 14th Amendment — even though the evidence against Greene in particular is pretty copious. Regardless, Friday’s testimony could be illuminating. Up to this point, Greene has been free to peddle lies ad infinitum, and because Republican leadership doesn’t seem to care, the only real consequence she’s faced has been getting banned from Twitter. She’ll now have to speak not only under the specter of media scrutiny, but of perjury charges.
