4/6/2022,"Allegations of stalking are often trivialised by Victorian police with victims left to take out intervention orders themselves, according to a report commissioned after the death of Celeste Manno in 2020. In its interim report on the state’s legal responses to stalking, the Victorian Law Reform Commission called for police to initiate intervention orders on behalf of stalking victims in a bid to improve early responses. Anthony North QC, chair of the VLRC, described stalking as an “invisible crime” that was frequently not recognised by both police and people who experience it. “It is often minimised or trivialised, and victim survivors are often expected to manage the situation on their own,” he said. “Our recommendations are intended to assist the police to recognise stalking, to take victims seriously, support them, and intervene quickly to stop the stalking.” The VLRC heard that police’s default position was to tell victims to apply for a personal safety and intervention order (PSIO), leaving them feeling they were left to take matters into their own hands. This is despite police having the power to apply for a PSIO on behalf of someone when they believe that a person needs protection, including if the person does not want an order to be made. “Each time I went to my local station, all they would do was say, ‘he hasn’t broken any laws so we can’t do anything’,” one victim told the VLRC. “The general reaction from police was that I was an older anxious woman who lived alone and not worth their time. That I was wasting their time.” Another victim told the commission: “I am angry that other officers do not take stalking seriously and treat victims like they are behaving irrationally.” The commission heard that when some victims reported stalking, they were told that taking out a PSIO themselves could compromise their safety. A PSIO is intended to protect people from someone other than a family member who is being violent, stalking, harassing or seriously threatening. The VLRC report was tabled in parliament on Wednesday, and was commissioned by the Andrews government after the death of Manno, 23, who was stabbed to death in her bedroom where she had been sleeping in Mernda in Melbourne’s north-east. Manno’s former work colleague Luay Sako, 35, has been charged with murder and has pleaded not guilty. In the wake of her death, Manno’s parents petitioned the state government to overhaul protections for stalking victims, prompting the VLRC review. The commission recommended Victoria police draw on the expertise of specialists to provide training that enhanced frontline police’s understanding and identification of stalking behaviours under the Crimes Act 1958. It also recommended the state’s police force develop guidelines for specialist interviewing to improve the recording of information to aid investigation of cases. Additionally, it said police should provide specific guidance to victims, such as how to end cyberstalking. Stalking affects at least one in six women and around one in 15 men, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ 2016 personal safety report. Most perpetrators of stalking are men, and most victims are women. Data from Victoria’s Crime Statistics Agency shows police recorded more than 1,100 non-family violence stalking offences over the past year – up 12% on the previous year. In Victoria, stalking is a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment. It can also be grounds for a personal safety intervention order. More than 25,000 stalking offences were reported to police in Victoria in the 10 years to 2020. The final report, due by 30 June, will focus on ways to address the conduct of people who engage in stalking behaviour, including those who breach intervention orders. It comes after Victorian police on Monday unveiled a nation-first stalker pilot trial that profiles stalkers in an attempt to prevent the behaviour escalating to violence and killings. Victoria police’s family violence assistant commissioner Lauren Callaway said the force continued to prioritise its response to stalking and had “numerous improvements” under way. “We are the first police jurisdiction in Australia to equip frontline police with an innovative and structured risk assessment tool to better protect victims from unwanted behaviour as part of a trial introduced at Prahran and Morwell police stations last month,” she said. “These improvements mean we will investigate and respond to these reports swiftly to improve safety for victims and hold perpetrators to account for their harmful actions.” Victims of stalking in Victoria can contact the Victims of Crime Helpline on 1800 819 817.",News/Australia news,"Victoria police failing to take stalking victims seriously, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/victoria-police-failing-to-take-stalking-victims-seriously-report-finds
4/6/2022,"A “heroic” neighbour who sacrificed his life to save a two-year-old boy died after being repeatedly hit with a kettlebell, a coroner has said. The body of Richard Woodcock, 38, a highways officer, was found by Thames Valley police when they forced their way into a property in Milton Keynes on 26 June last year. They had been called to a disturbance at the flat at about 9.40am. Another man, Kelvin Odichukumma Igweani, 24, was pronounced dead at the scene after a police officer fired four shots. Woodcock had gone to the flat, which was next door to his own, to help a boy who was thought to be in danger, Milton Keynes coroner’s court heard. The coroner, Tom Osborne, ruled that Woodcock was unlawfully killed and concluded that the little boy, who sustained life-threatening injuries and needed surgery, was saved by Woodcock’s “heroic conduct”. A postmortem examination found Woodcock received traumatic head injuries consistent with repeated blows to the head area, and a large kettlebell was thought to be the weapon used, the court heard. Woodcock intervened after a screaming woman came to his flat from next door “fearful of her life and obviously in an agitated state”. His wife was on a 999 telephone call to the police when Woodcock decided to try to help the child in the flat. He was dragged inside and seriously assaulted “to the point where he was hit with a 4kg dumbbell”, the coroner said. He said Woodcock’s death had had a devastating effect on his family, who would be haunted by what happened. A woman and another young child managed to flee the address before police arrived. DS Mike West, of Thames Valley police, told the court that two firearms officers responded and a Taser was used on Igweani, who had become “aggressive”. West said: “Officers gained entry to the address and saw Mr Woodcock prone on the floor. There was a large kettlebell and he had significant head injuries.” The inquest previously heard that the Taser was ineffective and Igweani barricaded himself in the main bedroom, where a child could be heard crying along with the sound of an ongoing assault. Police gained access to the bedroom and a police firearm was discharged. The coroner said: “Officer shots were fired and Mr Igweani suffered gunshot wounds.” An inquest into Igweani’s death will be held at a later date.",News/UK news,‘Heroic’ neighbour died in kettlebell attack saving two-year-old ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/05/heroic-neighbour-died-in-kettlebell-attack-saving-two-year-old
