1/3/2022,"Everton unveiled an expensive new recruit before kick-off and welcomed back Dominic Calvert-Lewin for the first time in four months but any thoughts of a fresh start for Rafael Benítez were quashed by Brighton’s first ever victory at Goodison Park.  Graham Potter’s visitors heightened the pressure on the Everton manager with a richly deserved victory, started and sealed by fine goals from Alexis Mac Allister. The Argentinian midfielder capped a confident Brighton performance with a stunning winner past Jordan Pickford. Despite the best efforts of Anthony Gordon, who also scored twice, the new year opened with familiar torment and a dearth of inspiration from Benítez’s team. Everton had not played for 17 days as a result of three consecutive postponements due to Covid outbreaks. According to Benítez’s programme notes: “We have used the time without matches to prepare as intensively as possible for the challenges Brighton present. This means understanding how to make it difficult for them to impose their style and, equally importantly, knowing how to create the chances to win the game.” Those words appeared ludicrous given what unfolded in the first half. Brighton were the more coherent, composed and dangerous side from the outset. They were aided and abetted by dismal defending from an Everton team that created next to nothing plus the approach adopted by Benítez himself. The Everton manager started the first home game of the new year with a five-man defence that featured Seamus Coleman at left wing-back. France international left-back Lucas Digne was available but, having been ostracised by Benítez and seen the club purchase Vitaliy Mykolenko for an initial £17.9m from Dynamo Kyiv, he was left on the bench throughout. Pointedly, Digne received a warm reception from the Goodison crowd when he sprinted along the touchline in the 40th minute and handed his shirt to a young Evertonian after the final whistle. Potter’s team swept into an early lead when exploiting the gaps that Everton’s shape was designed to eradicate. Joel Veltman had time to pick out Neal Maupay with a cross from the right that the unmarked striker headed over Michael Keane towards Mac Allister. The midfielder, also meeting no resistance as he arrived in the penalty area, placed a volley inside Pickford’s bottom right hand corner. Everton’s defence was found wanting again when Brighton doubled their advantage. Mac Allister turned provider when he drilled a corner to the near post where Enock Mwepu connected with a glancing header. Dan Burn, all alone at the back post having peeled away from Keane, headed home gleefully from close range. The hosts were handed a route back into the contest almost immediately when Mwepu was penalised for barging into the back of Gordon just inside the Brighton area. Referee John Brooks initially dismissed Everton appeals for a penalty but changed his mind when directed to the pitch-side monitor by VAR. Calvert-Lewin stepped up to announce his long-awaited return to the team in style but, after a short run-up, blazed the spot-kick over the bar. A first half to forget for Everton ended with a predictable chorus of boos. Benítez’s often-stated belief in a stronger second half to the season is based largely on the availability of Calvert-Lewin. The Everton centre-forward had been absent since the 2-0 win at Brighton on 28 August, when he scored his third goal in three appearances before being sidelined for four months with a toe and a recurring thigh injury. His physical presence, movement and finishing have been sorely missed for 15 matches and he will need time not only to recapture match sharpness, but to establish a rapport with those around him. Gordon and Demarai Gray worked tirelessly around the England international and were central to Everton’s second half improvement, albeit as individuals rather than an effective unit. Gordon brought Everton hope shortly after the restart with his first goal for his boyhood club. Receiving Allan’s pass on the right, the 20-year-old cut inside Marc Cucurella and Mac Allister before unleashing a left-footed drive that deflected off Adam Lallana and sailed beyond a wrong-footed Robert Sánchez. Gray and Allan both went close to equalising before Brighton re-established their two-goal lead courtesy of an outstanding goal from Mac Allister. Everton appeared to have dealt with a counterattack when Mason Holgate denied Maupay with a fine tackle as the forward raced through on goal. Keane, however, put his team back under pressure with a poor clearance that was seized upon by Burn. The defender found Leandro Trossard, and his low cross was flicked on to Mac Allister by Yves Bissouma. Brighton’s match-winner connected perfectly with the bouncing ball and Pickford was left grasping at thin air as the midfielder’s shot found the top corner from distance. The highly impressive Gordon pulled another goal back when rounding off a flowing move involving Calvert-Lewin and Jonjoe Kenny. Benítez introduced Salomón Rondón - to yet more boos - and although the substitute created a decent chance for Gordon’s hat-trick and volleyed over from André Gomes’s cross there would be no reprieve for Everton, nor their troubled manager.",Sport/Football,Brighton’s Mac Allister doubles up to pile misery on Benítez and Everton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/02/everton-brighton-premier-league-match-report
1/3/2022,"The personal Twitter account of the Georgia Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has been permanently suspended, for violating policies on misinformation about Covid-19.  Greene was issued a “fourth strike” in August, for saying vaccines were failing. That led to a seven-day suspension. A fifth violation prompted Sunday’s move by the social media giant. “We’ve been clear that … we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy,” a Twitter spokeswoman said. Greene is a determined controversialist and political extremist who has courted controversy and confrontation since being elected in 2020. She has regularly been fined for refusing to follow Covid guidelines in Congress, including those regarding wearing a mask on the House floor. On Twitter, her official congressional account remains active. In a statement on Sunday, Greene called Twitter “an enemy to America” and said it could not “handle the truth”. She also accused Twitter of seeking “a communist revolution” and said: “Social media platforms can’t stop the truth from being spread far and wide. Big tech can’t stop the truth. Communist Democrats can’t stop the truth. I stand with the truth and the people. We will overcome.” More than 825,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US, out of a caseload of nearly 55m. Many states are experiencing a surge of cases and consequent disruption to everyday life caused by the highly infectious Omicron variant.

1/3/2022,"Leeds United moved eight points clear of the Premier League relegation zone after a thoroughly deserved victory against a Burnley side who remain entrenched in the bottom three. Second-half goals from Stuart Dallas and Dan James were enough to consign Burnley to another defeat, and leave them with just a solitary win to their name in the league this season. They had levelled courtesy of a magnificent free-kick from Maxwel Cornet after Jack Harrison’s opener, but there was little doubting which side deserved to go on and win the game in the final minutes after that equaliser from Cornet.  Having dominated the majority of a pulsating opening 45 minutes at Elland Road, Leeds will have been disappointed to have only led by a solitary goal at half-time. That came courtesy of Harrison, who finished on the rebound after his initial strike had been saved by Wayne Hennessey. However, there were a litany of other chances for the hosts which came and went. By the time Harrison opened the scoring, Tyler Roberts perhaps should already have done so himself, diverting a header from a Luke Ayling cross just wide. Raphinha almost came close to catching Hennessey out from long range and when Harrison did eventually put Leeds in front, it was no less than they deserved. Sean Dyche’s response at half-time was to introduce Cornet and, just as he has whenever he has been on the pitch for Burnley this season, the Ivory Coast international had an impact. Cornet’s sublime free-kick curled past Illan Meslier to make it 1-1 and, in the ensuing celebrations from the Burnley players, Matthew Lowton was hit by a bottle from the home support which required the defender to receive medical attention. Cornet’s strike was his sixth in only 11 Premier League appearances since joining in the summer, and the important role he plays in this Burnley side will be of great concern given that he now heads to the Africa Cup of Nations. Without him, Burnley could sink further into trouble at the bottom. However Leeds responded well from that setback, taking control of the contest once again and going back ahead when a clever short corner from the hosts fell at the feet of Dallas. He curled a superb effort into Hennessey’s goal to put Marcelo Bielsa’s side back into the lead. Burnley pressed for a second equaliser, with Cornet at the heart of their endeavours. But he was powerless to prevent Leeds securing all three points in stoppage time when Joe Gelhardt’s cross was met by the head of fellow substitute James. Hennessey could only parry James’s effort into the net, guaranteeing a win for Leeds and ensuring Burnley remain two points adrift of safety.",Sport/Football,Stuart Dallas and Dan James power Leeds to victory over struggling Burnley,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/02/leeds-burnley-premier-league-match-report
1/3/2022,"Brentford stuck to their task and were rewarded handsomely. This win, sealed by Mads Roerslev’s goal seven minutes from time, did not seem on for long periods and an injury-hit side looked several notches short of their best. But Aston Villa squandered a fine opportunity in failing to build on Danny Ings’s opener, brilliantly set up by Emiliano Buendía, and were in trouble when Yoane Wissa levelled shortly before half-time. Steven Gerrard’s side dominated without threatening overly and a fourth defeat in six removes a little shine from the improvements he has wrought since taking over. Buendía’s moment of inspiration lit up a dank, drizzly afternoon whose opening exchanges had been tough on the eye. He has generally struggled to meet the standard demanded of the £30m fee Villa paid Norwich last summer but this was up there with the best of his offerings at Carrow Road.  To the less imaginative eye there was little on when Buendía took a first-time return pass from Douglas Luiz 10 yards inside Brentford’s half, although his initial layoff and dart into space had at least signalled an intention to get things moving. Christian Nørgaard was quickly at his back but the Argentinian was just too smart, losing his opponent in one movement with a giddying two-touch spin and drag-back. Now Brentford’s defence was exposed and Buendía made no mistake, supplying Ings with one of the delicately weighted through-balls that earned him renown. The finish across Álvaro Fernández from a slight angle on the left of the box, was impeccable and Ings had his first goal since 16 October. Even at that relatively early point, the game had needed it. Four minutes before the goal Buendía and Ings had served notice that they were in sync, Mads Bech Sørensen eventually thwarting the striker with a fine block, but Villa’s territorial advantage had not yielded much else. Both sides were depleted by injuries and, in the visitors’ case, Covid-19, Ollie Watkins adding to Gerrard’s concerns with an unspecified issue that denied him a run-out against his former club. The result was messy fare, although Villa seemed patently better resourced to mitigate the seasonal wear and tear. Brentford did not see a glimmer of goal until the 29th minute when Mathias Jensen shot wildly after a brief spell of pressure. Beyond that they had been scraping their way to the interval when Wissa intervened out of nothing. Villa had simply not been troubled but were cut open on their left had side by an exchange of passes between Jensen and Mads Roerslev. The latter had room to gain ground and pass inside to the onrushing Wissa, who shifted the ball onto his left foot with a sharp touch before curling past Emiliano Martínez from inside the “D”. The equaliser brought Gerrard, back in the technical area after missing the defeat to Chelsea with Covid, to his feet in frustration. A rising drive from John McGinn apart, his side had not especially threatened to stretch their lead; they had, though, looked a safe bet to see out the half and a previously flat crowd now had their tails up. They willed Wissa to find another way through three minutes after the restart but, after being closed down when a similar shot briefly seemed on, he was eventually crowded out. It continued to appear a game more likely to be settled by bolts of brilliance than any sustained cohesion, Buendía heightening that impression by whipping a 22-yard shot past Fernández’s full-stretch dive and narrowly wide. Brentford lost Sergi Canós, one of their livelier performers, to injury before the hour; Jensen, who had fleetingly been a pre-match doubt after a problem in the warm-up, soon departed too. The game’s shape was barely affected; Villa remained broadly dominant but disappointingly light on ideas, Matt Targett miscuing a decent opportunity to find waiting teammates with a volleyed cross from beyond the far post. Another lift was badly needed and Frank Onyeka almost provided it when, bursting through the midfield, he weighted a low shot towards Martínez’s left corner and drew a superb save. The keeper tipped it on to the outside of his post and behind; his first significant involvement of the afternoon appeared to have saved a point for Villa. Similar heroics should have been required of his opposite number almost immediately but, found unmarked by a free-kick, Ings planted a header straight at Fernández. The game had livened up; for the first time there seemed genuine scope for a winner and Roerslev duly provided it. The substitute Shandon Baptiste appeared to have lost control on the edge of the Villa area but, given a second bite, found the right wing-back in acres of space. Martínez parried his first effort but was given no chance from the rebound; Brentford had turned it around and, after Fernández made vital late saves from Ings and Buendía, they could celebrate.",Sport/Football,Mads Roerslev’s late winner gives Brentford victory over Aston Villa,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/02/brentford-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report
1/3/2022,"Have Australia been good or have England been bad? Obviously, this is the only way to analyse the Ashes. And it allows us to fling open the door to a frenzy of sizzling takes through its zero sum, binary veneer.  “Hapless England” certainly makes for engaging copy. Not only can we pick at the carcass of an on-field humiliation, but we can opine on the macro social, cultural and economic forces that shape Haseeb Hameed’s low hands. It allows David Warner to gift advice on syntho preparation. The Barmy Army can become cricket’s version of an industry lobbyist. And while “Chris Cooke bowling spells the death of Test cricket” might offer a lively conversation point, it conveniently ignores the fact he actually hoops them. It is also true, though unpopular, to say that Australia have been good. Six weeks ago this was a team that had more questions hovering over it than Prince Andrew. David Warner was turning 35. The young prodigy deigned to partner him had withdrawn, and the alternatives failed to inspire. Steve Smith hadn’t dominated for a while. Marnus Labuschagne was due a downturn. There was a yawning gap in the middle order. Cameron Green was an all-rounder without a wicket. The frontline bowlers didn’t deliver last summer. The team hadn’t played in nearly a year. The rare units of the triumphant T20 team weren’t around to offset the coach. If England could just apply some pressure, would the team return to old dynamics? Then the skipper resigned amid scandal. We chin-stroked over a bowling captain, irrespective of his eyes and his blazer fitting just-so. We weren’t used to new keepers. For a cricketing nation welded to a tradition of conservatism and incumbency, there was a fair bit of flux. These were conditions ripe for a surprise. Instead, the Ashes were secured in twelve days. Beyond the influence of white balls and private schools on England’s cricket, the component parts of Australia’s victory are worth exploring. Most significantly, every single player involved has contributed something meaningful to a win. This is important, because it illustrates a team with a complete working configuration, rare for Australia in modern times. Previous series wins, however close or dominant, tended to happen on the back of one or two outsized contributions, particularly with the bat. Warner against Pakistan. labuschagne against New Zealand. Smith in England. Here, every incumbent has firmed their grip on their position. Warner navigated the Gabba with a grizzled opener’s maturity, before an altogether more complete contribution in Adelaide. Labuschagne did the same, but in the reverse fixture. Smith almost capped a return to the captaincy with a century. Travis Head upended a rare moment of English pressure with a violent, match-winning hundred. Cameron Green graduated from gun-barrel to gun with the ball. Alex Carey has twice played the sort of brisk, keeper’s innings to close the door on opposition opportunity. He’s also gloved the ball well enough and eschewed the stardom of the stump mic. Of the batters, last to join the party was Marcus Harris. He was retained by selectors in Melbourne despite growing calls for change, and responded with an innings of 76 runs from 190 balls, outstripping the entire opposition’s second innings for balls faced. This was a match-winning innings, yet in some quarters it merely cemented views on Harris’s low ceiling. There is a unique phenomenon in Australia, possibly born of the pathways ideology, where we regard players for their future, not current, output, but Harris’ innings would’ve warmed the hardest opener’s heart, and seasoned eyes understand these types of knocks are vital to the consistency of any outfit. Australia will need more of these. Not least because they ensure bowlers always have something to work with. “The Cartel” have been irrepressible, with hard statistics showing their rewards aren’t simply a function of English ineptitude. For many years track-suited coaches have been wont to say that bowling is a closed skill, and CricBuzz’s Freddie Wilde gave Australia’s efforts some teeth, noting that, “Australia’s bowling in the Ashes has been the best in a 3+ match series in our ball-tracking database. No team on record has bowled as fast (38% above 140kph) & as accurately (41% on good line & length).” The world class operators have delivered, and each understudy has impressed. Where Scott Boland’s spirit soared after he stood on the shoulders of his ancestral giants, it was also reward for years and years of pounding the bitumen-esque Junction Oval with hard length after hard length. There is harmony in the unit too. There has been no macho bullshit, yet. The leadership dynamics overseeing present life are not yet clear, but one suspects the rising influence of calm heads like George Bailey, Tony Dodemaide, Michael Di Venuto, Andrew McDonald and Pat Cummins have helped. Justin Langer – whether through direction or design – has permitted this and must be afforded credibility for doing so. It begs an awkward question: what does Langer do now? To be fair to him, whatever it is (or isn’t), it’s working. Cummins will be the key voice in his renewal. For now, the going is good, and the Australian cricketing public is rightly accepting the home Ashes opiate, because like England, the home country has its own systemic problems ready to be revealed once stronger opponents line up in less homely conditions. That’s when when we’ll learn more about the merits of this perennial “almost-team”, as they ready themselves for another trip to explore the summit.",Sport/Sport,"Never mind England’s misery, celebrate Australia’s Ashes brilliance | Sam Perry",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/03/never-mind-englands-misery-celebrate-australias-ashes-brilliance
1/3/2022,"A second teenager has been arrested on suspicion of murdering 15-year-old Zaian Aimable-Lina, who was stabbed to death in a park in south London on Thursday. A 15-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of murder late on Saturday and is being held at a south London police station, the Metropolitan police said.  Another 15-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of murder on Friday and has since been released on bail until a date in late January. The killing of Zaian marked the 29th teenage homicide in London in 2021, a total that now stands at 30 after a 16-year-old was killed in west London less than an hour later. It is the city’s worst ever annual death toll from teenage homicides. Zaian died at the scene of the attack in Ashburton Park in Croydon shortly after 7.30pm on Thursday. Police said a postmortem examination gave the cause of death as a stab wound to the heart. DCI Richard Leonard made a direct appeal on Saturday for information about the local boy’s death. He said: “My team are continuing to work around the clock so that we can give Zaian’s family the answers they deserve.“No matter how insignificant you may think it, if you have information that can help, you must do the right thing and contact us immediately.” A 16-year-old boy in Yiewsley, west London, who has yet to be named, was the victim of the second fatal stabbing on Thursday.

1/3/2022,"As a new term is set to start for schools across the UK and the government announces masks will return for secondary pupils in England’s classrooms, we take a look at the potential impact of Omicron on children.  According to case data for the week to 27 December 2021 – which is based on infections picked up by testing – rates are currently highest among young adults. However, rates per 100,000 people are also high among children, at 1,126.5 for those aged 10 to 14, and 836.2 for those aged five to nine. Further insights come from the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, revealing that in the week ending 23 December infection levels in England were highest among those aged two to Year 6 and those aged 25 to 34, at about one in 15 people for both groups. An estimated one in 20 of secondary school-aged children to Year 11 in England had Covid in the same week, compared with one in 45 of those aged 50 to 69 and one in 100 of those aged 70 and over. Early reports from South Africa raised concerns that may be the case. However, a preliminary analysis by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) based on the situation in England has suggested a lower risk of hospitalisation among Omicron cases in school-age children compared with Delta cases. While the findings are good news, experts have stressed some children can still become sick from Covid and require hospital care, while there are also concerns about the potential impact of long Covid. Two doses of the Covid jab have been recommended for all those aged 12 to 17 in the UK, with some offered an additional jab, for example if they are severely immunosuppressed. A booster dose has recently been announced for all 16- to 17-year-olds and some children aged 12 to 15, such as those who are in a clinical risk group. Last month the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said that two Covid jabs would also be made available for clinically vulnerable five- to 11-year-olds, as well as those living with someone who is immunosuppressed. The doses will be a third of the quantity used for adults. Educational staff and secondary school pupils in Scotland, Northern Ireland and England are asked to take two lateral flow tests a week, while in Wales they have been asked to take three. “Testing remains voluntary but is strongly encouraged,” guidance from the Department for Education states, adding that secondary schools should also retain capacity to carry out asymptomatic testing on-site for pupils who are unable to test themselves at home. Concerns have been raised about the availability of lateral flow tests, with those attempting to request kits online in recent days having repeatedly been faced with messages stating “no home delivery slots left”, and some pharmacies also running out. However, the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, has said schools will have their own supplies of lateral flow tests. This varies from country to country. However, there are common approaches, including an emphasis on hygiene and sanitation. On Saturday it was announced that secondary school pupils in England should return to wearing masks in classrooms, not just communal areas, a measure already in place in the other countries of the UK. While Robert Halfon, the chair of the House of Commons education select committee, has raised concerns, including saying that there is very limited evidence of the efficacy of masks in educational settings, others have backed the measure, pointing out that while masks are not perfect, and their effectiveness depends on their quality, a number of studies have suggested mask-wearing in schools is linked to smaller increases in case rates and a lower likelihood of outbreaks. Zahawi has also announced that nurseries, schools and colleges would be given 7,000 more air cleaning units in a bid to improve ventilation, a move the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, Mary Bousted, said would be “completely inadequate”. Zahawi has said he will do “everything in his power” to protect education. However, some experts have said more should be done. “The fact that children [in England] who are household members of a case are mandated to come into school, and children sitting next to a case in a classroom are not even considered close contacts, suggests that policies are geared towards maximising transmission rather than protecting children and their families,” Dr Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist at Queen Mary University of London, told the Guardian. Another key issue is staffing, given the level of absences because of Covid and self-isolation, with ex-teachers being encouraged to return – although there are doubts this will happen in time for the new term in England. It seems likely that at least some teaching will be done remotely, with Zahawi urging schools to implement a flexible approach to learning where necessary, to maximise on-site education.",News/World news,What impact will Omicron have on UK children and schools?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/what-impact-will-omicron-have-on-uk-children-and-schools-covid-england-classrooms
