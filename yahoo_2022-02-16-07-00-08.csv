2/16/2022,"A group of Republican senators sent a letter to the Justice Department on Tuesday to express ""strong opposition"" to creating a federal no-fly list for unruly passengers, claiming ""the majority of recent infractions on airplanes has been in relation to the mask mandate."" Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Marco Rubio and Rick Scott of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas were among those who signed a letter opposing Delta Airlines' CEO Ed Bastian's, request earlier this month that the DOJ create a ""no-fly"" list for passengers convicted of federal offenses relating to on-board disruptions. 2021 saw a major spike in unruly passengers, with more than 5,981 reported cases, according to the FAA. The agency notes, of those cases, 4290 were mask-related. ""Creating a federal 'no-fly' list for unruly passengers who are skeptical of this mandate would seemingly equate them to terrorists who seek to actively take the lives of Americans and perpetrate attacks on the homeland,"" the GOP senators' letter said. ""The [Transportation Security Administration] was created in the wake of 9/11 to protect Americans from future horrific attacks, not to regulate human behavior onboard flights."" The senators argued airlines could create their own no-fly lists and refuse services to unruly passengers, but that it would be an overreach for the federal government to do so. MORE: After increase in assaults, flight attendants are saying enough is enough Many airlines have already done this, but they do not prevent an offender from boarding another carrier. Delta has previously asked other U.S. airlines to share their internal no-fly lists so that people who endangered their crew can't do so on another airline. ""The creation of this list by DOJ would result in a severe restriction on the ability of citizens to fully exercise their constitutional right to engage in interstate transportation,"" the GOP letter said. ""It also raises serious concerns about future unrelated uses and potential expansions of the list based on political pressures."" In Bastian's request to the DOJ, he indicated that he believes banning unruly passengers from all commercial flights will send a strong signal to the flying public that not following crew member instructions comes with severe consequences. MORE: Delta CEO: Put convicted unruly passengers on national 'no-fly' list ""This action will help prevent future incidents and serve as a strong symbol of the consequences of not complying with crew member instructions on commercial aircraft,"" he wrote. Unruly passenger incidents onboard Delta planes have increased nearly 100% since 2019, according to Bastian. The airline has placed almost 2,000 people on Delta's internal no-fly list for refusing to wear a mask and has submitted around 1,000 banned names to the TSA to pursue civil penalties. Other people in the industry have called for support of a no-fly list for unruly passengers. Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, responded in a statement to the GOP senators. ""We've been punched, kicked, spit on, and sexually assaulted. This puts everyone at risk and disrupts the safety of flight, which is never acceptable and every single one of the senators who signed this letter knows full well what is at stake if we leave a gap in aviation safety and security,"" Nelson said. ""It is irresponsible and political brinkmanship that will put our economic security at risk right along with our lives."" Nelson pushed back against the lawmakers' argument about mask mandates, noting many charges stem from incidents unrelated to mask-wearing. ""Our union continues to call for the creation of a centralized list of passengers who may not fly for a period of time after being fined or convicted of a serious incident. This is not about ""masks,"" and the worst attacks have nothing to do with masks,"" Nelson said. ""You're either for protecting crew and passengers from these attacks or you're against. We need clear and consistent rules with strict consequences for those who cannot respect our collective efforts to keep everyone safe - in the air and on the ground."" There should be zero tolerance for airline passengers who threaten the safety of others. We need @TheJusticeDept to prosecute these perpetrators to the law's fullest extent, @DHSgov to create a no-fly list for unruly passengers & @FAANews to issue the final secondary barrier rule https://t.co/FHrLORvjtO — Capt. Joe DePete (@ALPAPresident) February 15, 2022 Joe DePete, the president of the Air Line Pilots Association, called for the Department of Homeland Security to create a ""no-fly list"" for unruly passengers. ""There should be zero tolerance for airline passengers who threaten the safety of others,"" DePete said in a tweet Tuesday. Delta responded to the Republicans senators in a statement, saying unruly passengers risk the safety of airline staff and other passengers. ""Delta welcomes the interest from Congress as U.S. airlines continue to grapple with an uptick in unruly passengers, putting the safety of airline employees and the flying public at risk,"" a spokesperson for Delta told ABC News on Tuesday. ""At Delta, nothing is more important than ensuring a safe and secure travel experience for our customers and our people.""

2/16/2022,"Federal safety regulators say they will retain power to approve Boeing 787 airliners for flight rather than return that authority to the aircraft maker, which hasn't been able to deliver any new Dreamliner planes since last May because of production flaws. The Federal Aviation Administration said it told Boeing of its decision Tuesday. The FAA said that once deliveries of 787s resume, it will perform final inspections and retain power to clear each new plane until it is confident that Boeing’s quality control and manufacturing “consistently produce 787s that meet FAA design standards.” It also said Boeing must have a plan for handling planes that need reworking. “This will allow the agency to confirm the effectiveness of measures Boeing has undertaken to improve the 787 manufacturing process,” the FAA said in a statement. For years, the FAA has relied on Boeing employees to certify the airworthiness of planes by deputizing some company employees to act on behalf of the agency. The practice came under intense criticism after two deadly crashes involving Boeing 737 Max jets and revelations that FAA officials knew little about a key flight control systems implicated in the crashes. The 787, a larger plane than the 737, has been plagued by production flaws such as unacceptable gaps between fuselage panels. Deliveries were stopped briefly in late 2020, then again in May 2021 and have not resumed. Boeing has more than 100 undelivered 787s. The halt in shipments has deprived Chicago-based Boeing Co. of cash that airlines pay when they receive new planes. Boeing, afraid of appearing to pressure the FAA to resume deliveries, has declined to give investors an idea of when 787 shipments might resume. A spokeswoman said Tuesday, “We will continue to engage with the FAA to ensure we meet their expectations and all applicable requirements.” Separately, Democrats who lead the House Transportation Committee renewed their criticism of FAA and asked for a federal review of the agency's oversight of the Boeing 737. The lawmakers questioned why the FAA did not take action against Boeing for, they said, downplaying the significance of the flight-control system, which repeatedly pushed the nose of the plane down before both crashes. They also suggested that the FAA should have taken action against Boeing for selling 737 Max jets on which a system designed to warn pilots about the failure of key sensors did not work on about 80% of the planes. Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., and Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Wash., who leads its aviation subcommittee, said the “blatant lack of enforcement actions” could encourage airplane manufacturers to ignore design standards in future planes. They asked the inspector general of the Transportation Department to review the matter. Boeing declined to comment on the lawmakers' request.

2/16/2022,"Joan MacDonald went from struggling with stairs to being a fitness influencer on Instagram with more than 1 million followers -- and she did it while in her 70s. Her transformation journey began five years ago, when she said she was fatigued, suffering from painful arthritis and struggled to walk up and down stairs. Joan MacDonald's breaking point, she said, came when she was told by a doctor that her blood pressure was rising and she would need to again increase her medication. Her daughter, Michelle MacDonald, a fitness coach, was visiting her at the time and challenged her to make changes to her diet and exercise to improve her quality of life. ""When Michelle gave me that ultimatum to do something about my life, I figured it's now or never,"" Joan MacDonald said. ""I was sick and tired of being sick and tired. It was existing, not living."" In January 2017, just a few weeks before her 71st birthday, Joan MacDonald flew from her home in Canada to Tulum, Mexico, where Michelle MacDonald and her husband own a gym. She began to follow a diet program laid out by her daughter that was focused on making sure she got enough macronutrients -- fats, carbohydrates and proteins -- in five meals per day, rather than sporadically snacking like she had done before. Joan MacDonald also began to workout in the gym for the first time with Michelle MacDonald, founder of The Wonder Woman, a strength and bodybuilding coaching program. ""It was tough in the beginning,"" Michelle MacDonald said. ""People don't realize that [my mom] was there in the trenches, trying to figure it all out and getting frustrated."" According to Joan MacDonald, her motivation to continue came from how much better she started to feel very quickly. MORE: This mom and her daughters have lost more than 150 pounds She said she lost around 10 pounds in the first month of training, and in just a few months she was able to reduce her medications by half. Once she returned to Canada, Joan MacDonald continued with her wellness journey by tracking her food on a macronutrient-focused app and by continuing her workouts. ""I go to the gym five days a week,"" she said, noting two of those days are cardio-focused workouts. ""I like that routine, because it gives you something to look forward to."" Over the past four years, she said she has maintained a 65-pound weight loss and gone off medications for high blood pressure, high cholesterol and acid reflux.    A post shared by Joan MacDonald (@trainwithjoan) As she transformed her health, Joan MacDonald said she was encouraged by her daughter to start an Instagram account to document her progress and connect with other people. Today, her Train With Joan Instagram account has 1.5 million followers. She also has a website and an app that offers workout and meal plans overseen by Michelle MacDonald, who specializes in coaching women of all ages.    A post shared by Joan MacDonald (@trainwithjoan) Joan MacDonald said she hopes people who follow her journey take away that it's never too late to change your life, no matter your age or situation. ""Nothing is magical. It's work, but it's work that you can enjoy,"" she said. ""In the end, you are going to be stronger and healthier, and that's all that really matters."" The MacDonalds shared five tips for people who want to transform their health, no matter their age. 1. Think about your sleep. ""We live in a culture that doesn’t prioritize sleep,"" Michelle MacDonald said. ""But there’s so much research that shows when you’re not getting eight hours of quality sleep, it really negatively impacts you hormonally, cognitive function and your body."" 2. Drink lots of water and eat protein with every meal. Michelle MacDonald said most women she works with, including her mom, come to her not eating enough calories. She recommends eating five meals consistently throughout the day and including protein at every meal, with the goal of eating in total daily one gram of protein for every pound of a person's ideal body weight, so 130 grams of protein if their ideal weight is 130 pounds. In addition, Michelle MacDonald recommends drinking at least three liters of water for day, for most people. ""Drink more water, and pace it out,"" she said. ""Drinking mindfully is an easy way to attach yourself to this idea that you're taking care of yourself."" MORE: This 82-year-old TikTok influencer is all the fitness inspiration we need 3. Get active. Start by just walking, aiming for 10,000 steps per day, which can be broken up and completed throughout the day, according to Michelle MacDonald. Once a person is ready, she recommends adding in 45 minutes of strength training a few day per week. ""Train with intention, not lifting the same weight forever,"" she said. ""If you want to use the weights to change your body, you want to do that with intention and try to push yourself.""    A post shared by Joan MacDonald (@trainwithjoan) 4. Focus on a positive mindset. Joan MacDonald said she continually works on having a positive inner dialogue in order to help her reach her goals. ""Mindset is something that I am still learning, and I know that it's a very strong factor in everything,"" she said. ""It's something you really have to work at."" Both she and her daughter recommend journaling in the morning to set intentions and start off the day with a clear head.    A post shared by Joan MacDonald (@trainwithjoan) 5. Document your progress. Take a photo of yourself on the day you start your journey, and keep documenting your progress, Michelle MacDonald recommends. ""Have a starting photo ... and take photos every week,"" she said. ""You may not feel changes, but you’ll see them.""

2/16/2022,"The structure of Earth's core could be unlike any other state of matter, researchers have found. Yu He, a physicist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and lead author of a study published this month in the journal Nature, said the calculations challenged what researchers once understood about the inner core. He and his colleagues found the inner core creates a ""superionic state"" made up of hydrogen, oxygen and carbon. He said it's unlike any solid or liquid form. ""It is quite abnormal,"" He said in a statement to USA TODAY. ""The solidification of iron at the inner core boundary does not change the mobility of these light elements, and the convection of light elements is continuous in the inner core."" Is our planet becoming 'inactive'? Earth's core is rapidly cooling, study reveals. Footprints from centuries ago: Dinosaur footprints from 200 million years ago discovered on beach in Wales Because the researchers couldn't directly study the Earth's core, they analyzed earthquake data and created simulations that mirrored the pressures and temperatures found at the inner core. Rather than a solid compressed ball of iron alloy, He's study found superheated solid and liquid states known as ""superionic"" during the simulations. The study leaves one question unanswered: Why is this superionic form found in the Earth's inner core? He said more research is needed. ""I think more studies are needed to explain other seismic features, such as seismic anisotropy, in the inner core,"" He told ABC Science News. What's everyone talking about?
