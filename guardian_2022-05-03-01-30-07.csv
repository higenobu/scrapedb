5/3/2022,"The problem with Russia suffering “colossal losses” (Moscow confirms attack on Kyiv during UN chief’s visit, 29 April) is that this really does not matter to its leaders. You only have to look back at historic campaigns involving Russia and its satellites to see that one of its major tactics is to keep throwing men (and women) into battle until the other side runs out of steam. A comparison of the allied (British, American and French) cemeteries from the second world war in what was West Berlin and the Soviet war memorial in Treptow Park in the erstwhile East Berlin shows the difference in attitude to the value of human life: on the one hand individual graves lovingly cared for, each with its cross; on the other a vast arena where a statue of a Russian soldier holds aloft a child and stamps on the symbol of Nazism, while looking across to the statue of Mother Russia. Between them lie anonymous sarcophagi, each containing an unnumbered quantity of unnamed bodies. Western rhetoric will not deter Vladimir Putin, who is a past master of the art; our politicians must find an effective brake to his ambitions in order to prevent further aggression from him.Anne MaclennanCuguen, France  I was relieved to read your editorial (29 April) explicitly addressing the risks of escalation of the Ukraine war. I have been alarmed at the increasingly bellicose rhetoric of our government, politicians and commentators in the press, which has drifted towards war between Nato and Russia, without any reflection on the risks raised by a conflict between nuclear powers. As someone who lived through much of the cold war, I am astonished and terrified by the apparent lack of concern over the risks of this crisis; where alarm bells should be ringing loudly, nuclear escalation is hardly referred to, despite nuclear Armageddon being a predictable consequence. Whereas the priority should be seeking a negotiated end to the conflict involving unpalatable compromises, all the rhetoric has been of victory and defeat. Unless this changes, the risks will only steadily increase.Stephen SmithGlasgow  Another brilliant piece by Simon Jenkins (Liz Truss risks recklessly inflaming Ukraine’s war to serve her own ambition, 28 April). With a prime minister who thinks he’s Winston Churchill and a foreign secretary who thinks she’s Margaret Thatcher, we are at risk of bellicose fantasy sliding into bloody reality. Putin is dangerous, but the best response to danger is rationality, not grandiose promises. Putin needs a way out. A joint undertaking by Russia and Nato to guarantee the neutrality of Ukraine (and other nations) should have been on the table to avert the invasion, but it could still be a way of offering Putin a basis for peace. He would no doubt claim it was an achievement of his demonstration of strength, but sustaining sovereignty would be the real benefit. The endgame has to be agreement, not mutually assured destruction.Andrew SeberWinchester  Neal Ascherson’s condemnation of Liz Truss’s dangerous rhetoric is clear and welcome (Letters, 28 April). It is founded on deep understanding of the countries and peoples who live near or around the Black Sea. His call for Truss to be put “back into her cage” should be extended to Boris Johnson and Ben Wallace, who dangerously talk up conflict as a solution and themselves as “leaders”.Darra McFadyenLondon  Many international lawyers argue that Nato is an illegal organisation since it is a political and military alliance, not exclusively focused on peace and security, although it signed up to article 2(4) of the UN charter prohibiting use of force to resolve disputes. Liz Truss ignores its peace role and is promoting the continuance of this horrendous war, rather than seeking ways to end it.Margaret OwenLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/3/2022,"In September 1985, a New York Times article bemoaned the decline of the established stars of country music and the cliched “Nashville Sound”, but help was already on the way. Why Not Me, the 1984 debut album by mother and daughter duo the Judds, had topped the US country chart, was racking up multimillion sales, and had delivered three No 1 country singles, Why Not Me, Girls’ Night Out and Love Is Alive. With her daughter Wynonna, Naomi Judd, who has died aged 76 after suffering from depression and mental illness, was about to top the country chart again with the follow-up album, Rockin’ With the Rhythm. It would also generate three more chart-topping singles. To their amazement, the Judds found themselves nominated for best new artist at the 1985 Grammy awards, up against mainstream pop stars such as Cyndi Lauper and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. The Judds were not alone either, because 1986 brought a swathe of debut albums by a posse of artists including Steve Earle, Lyle Lovett and Dwight Yoakam – “New Traditionalists” – who would galvanise a stagnant Nashville. But the Judds’ family bond gave them something special. Naomi and Wynonna had listened to country music’s famous sibling acts, including the Delmore Brothers and the Everly Brothers as well as the swing-era trio the Boswell Sisters and the Andrews Sisters. The Judds’ own voices made a naturally organic mix. Wynonna’s was powerful and bluesy, and mixed with Naomi’s sweeter tone to form an unmistakable and commercially irresistible blend. With songs that melded elements of bluegrass, folk, early rock’n’roll and even a little bebop, and lyrics that often empathised with the lives of small-town, working-class women, the Judds became a natural addition to country’s lineage of forceful female stars such as Tammy Wynette or Patsy Cline. However, their joint career was cut painfully short. In 1990 Naomi announced that she was suffering from hepatitis C, and the Judds gave up performing the following year (though they would reunite for some one-off shows, and mounted the Power to Change tour in 2000 and the Last Encore Tour in 2010-11). They had notched up 14 No 1 singles on the country chart, while their six albums had sold more than 20m copies, making them, at the time, history’s most successful country duo. They won five Grammy awards, nine Country Music Association awards and seven awards from the Academy of Country Music. Naomi was born Diana Judd in Ashland, Kentucky, daughter of Charles Judd, a petrol station owner, and Pauline (nee Oliver), who was a cook on a Mississippi river boat. At the age of three, she was sexually abused by an uncle, an event she believed helped trigger her history of depression. At 17 she became pregnant by Charles Jordan, but he abandoned her, and in January 1964 she married Michael Ciminella. Later that year Wynonna was born, the birth causing Naomi to miss her high school graduation ceremony. In 1965 her younger brother Brian died of Hodgkin’s disease, and her parents split up. Naomi’s second daughter, Ashley, was born in 1968, by which time she and her husband had moved to Los Angeles, where Naomi began studying for a nursing degree. Ashley would become a successful film actor, with roles in Heat, Double Jeopardy and A Time To Kill, among others. Naomi and Ciminella divorced in 1972, and she took a variety of jobs to support her daughters. A traumatic assault and rape by a drug-addicted ex-boyfriend prompted her to leave Los Angeles and move to a cottage in Morrill, Kentucky, where she struggled to pay the bills while Wynonna became absorbed in singing and learning to play the guitar. They moved back to Marin County, California, where Naomi enrolled in nursing school. She was often frustrated by Wynonna’s obsession with music (“she’d even take grocery money to buy new guitar strings,” she recalled), until she discovered that she and her daughter had a natural instinct for singing harmony together. Naomi recalled the influence of the coal-mining songs of Hazel Dickens and Alice Gerrard. “As these women harmonised together, it came to me: Wynonna and I couldn’t talk to each other, but, lo and behold, we could sing together.” After Naomi completed her nursing studies, the family moved to Nashville in 1979. Three years later, Naomi was assigned to nurse the daughter of the record producer Brent Maher after she had been injured in a road accident. A grateful Maher agreed to listen to a demo tape Naomi and Wynonna had recorded, and when he had heard it he instantly agreed to become their producer. He spent six months developing and honing their sound, and in 1983 they were signed to RCA following a live audition. In early 1984 they released the six-track EP Wynonna & Naomi, from which Mama He’s Crazy became their first song to top the country chart. The song also appeared on their debut album later that year. After Naomi gave up performing with the Judds, she founded the Naomi Judd Education and Research Fund to raise awareness about hepatitis C and became an advocate for the American Liver Foundation. She took occasional acting roles, hosted the Sunday morning talk show Naomi’s New Morning in 2005 and joined the reality-competition show Can You Duet as a judge in 2008. She had married Larry Strickland (a former backing singer for Elvis Presley) in 1989, and in 2017 the couple competed in the reality cooking series My Kitchen Rules. She also published a string of books, including River of Time: My Descent Into Depression and How I Emerged With Hope (2016). In a 2017 interview she described how her mental state had declined dramatically after she stopped performing. “When I came off the tour I went into this deep, dark absolutely terrifying hole and I couldn’t get out. I spent two years on my couch.” The Judds had been planning a concert tour for this autumn. She is survived by her husband and daughters.

5/3/2022,"The season that ended early with Carlo Ancelotti becoming the only manager to win all five of Europe’s major leagues started with a phone call about something completely different. If this wasn’t exactly the way they had planned it, that’s because it was better. In late May last year Zinedine Zidane announced he was leaving Real Madrid, dropping a letter bomb as he went, and the sudden search for someone to replace him wasn’t going particularly well. Until one Saturday when, discussing other deals, they told Ancelotti as much, the conversation shifting from players to coaches, an idea forming. What about me? A couple of calls later and it was done. By the Tuesday, Ancelotti had been announced as the new old manager. They briefed him but he didn’t really need them to: it was enough to know that this is Real Madrid. Sure, he had been unhappy about how they had sacked him last time, yes he was aware of the pressure and politics it brings having suffered it himself, but still: it’s Real Madrid, a second chance he never expected. “If it had been anyone else, I would have said ‘no’,” he claimed. Everton weren’t as bothered as they should have been and if some in Madrid weren’t as excited as they should have been either, Madrid had a manager. Twelve months on, they have a league title too, Ancelotti’s first in Spain to go with one at each of Milan, Chelsea, PSG and Bayern. On Wednesday night, they also have a Champions League semi-final second leg, the fans celebrating this success also trying to prepare the ground for that one, chanting “si, se puede!” – yes, we can! And so far the evidence in Europe is that somehow, even if they don’t entirely know how, they can. Domestically, it is easier to understand: while the victory that removed any last doubt they would win the league was another comeback, winning 3-2 at Sevilla having been 2-0 down, in the end Madrid’s title comes down to the most basic thing of all: they’ve been better than everyone else. On Saturday afternoon, they defeated Espanyol 4-0 at the Bernabéu, winning the league in front of their fans for the first time in 15 years. “We did it with four weeks to spare, and that says it all,” insisted Luka Modric. If at times it has been hard to judge how good Madrid are, if Marca’s Rubén Jiménez described this season as a cowboys and Indians film without any Indians, Atletico 25 points off where they finished last year with 12 to play for and Barcelona and Sevilla 13 points off, Madrid haven’t wrapped up a league this early in 32 years. They lead by 15 points, which would equal the biggest ever margin. They have scored more goals, created more chances and completed more passes than anyone. And they have lost just three times, responding to each defeat by going 10 weeks unbeaten: Espanyol in week eight, Getafe in week 19, Barcelona in week 29. That last one hurt. This is a team with flaws but with moments too, players whose highest level is superior, and they tend to step up when it mattered most. “We won in hard places,” Ancelotti said, “Sevilla, San Sebastian, Bilbao, Barcelona.” Away at nine of the top 10 – this week they visit Atlético – they’ve only dropped points in a draw at Villarreal. At the Bernabéu they beat Sevilla, Atlético and Real Sociedad. Madrid have only had two spells off the top – after week two and between weeks 9 and 14 when they had a game in hand – and won’t be off it for the rest of the season now. Which is why they were celebrating on Saturday, the trophy actually handed to them on the day they won the thing, which is progress, Marcelo bowing before Modric, Nacho fetching David Alaba’s chair and taking Sergio Ramos and Raúl’s role of performing bullfighting passes, kids sliding by. Players and staff danced in a huge circle. Fans followed the bus down the Castellana, trophy taped on tight to prevent another tumble, while over 100,000 people waited at Cibeles, the Roman Goddess of fertility. Carlo Ancelotti was thrown into the sky, shouting “More! More!” “I enjoyed being in the air,” he said. Then he thanked Madrid for this opportunity. There was a hint of tears as he talked. “Getting emotional is genetic: my grandfather did it and my father did it too,” he said. And yet while that was understandable, if there’s anything that has defined this title-winning season it is how calm he has been, how in control; how he doesn’t seem to care about any of the crap, barely an eyebrow raised, albeit raised a long way. That has always been the case but this year, at 62, given another go, all the more so. “The work has been easy for me,” he said, and sometimes it feels like it really has been, like he has been able to leave them to get on with it and just enjoy the ride, like this is not about him. Not least because the person who least makes it about Carlo Ancelotti is Carlo Ancelotti. There was a moment earlier this season when Ancelotti said Modric, Toni Kroos and Casemiro do things he hasn’t asked them to do. “Madrid fans can rest easy,” he said, “I’m not going to interfere.” There may be something in that and this has been their league. It has been Karim Benzema’s league, the best player in Spain by a very long way. And it has Thibaut Courtois’s league, saving 75% of shots faced, running at a miracle a match or more. It has certainly been Vinícius’s league, scoring twice as many as in the last three seasons combined, even though it didn’t look likely to begin with. This league has been about them and their teammates, but this is also Ancelotti’s league. When Ancelotti took over, his idea was to play Eden Hazard and Gareth Bale up front but Vinícius took over, his case made and closed swiftly, quietly. Pragmatism without posturing: if it doesn’t work, move on; if it does work, do it, facilitate it. Bale started the first three games and only once thereafter, clocking up more minutes with Wales than Madrid; Hazard has scored no league goals. The most expensive players in Madrid’s history with the highest salaries in the squad, their absence has not mattered. Nor even has the departure of Sergio Ramos and Raphaël Varane, the defence that sustained them over a decade. In part, because Ancelotti didn’t let it. In those early weeks, Dani Carvajal said this Ancelotti was different to the one he had known before in being more focused on the defence. He talked about how he wanted defenders to be pessimists, not optimists – it’s better they fear the worst. He, though, is an optimist with a lightness of touch, managing moments that, in this giant echo chamber, can become bigger than they really are. He knows: when he arrived, he was asked about Zidane’s complaints, the response suggesting his former assistant really should have known where he was. “I’ve been in football almost 40 years and people speak – it’s normal,” he said. There are things you can’t change, so don’t try. He made no demands, no requests for players, no complaints about gaps in the squad or players who didn’t care enough. He started no fires; instead he put them out, every debate gently dismissed, managed like it was the most natural thing in the world. He won the league with a midfield aged, 36, 32 and 30. He didn’t really rotate, 10 of the XI clear (although Kroos and Modric have sat out a significant chunk of games). He ignored warnings about a late season collapse like last time, and they reached the season’s close in better physical shape than anyone expected. “I don’t listen to what’s said; I look at the data we have from games and training,” he said, trusting in fitness trainer Antonio Pintus who rejoined last summer. When it was suggested that they played too deep – the stats reveal a team lining up two and a half metres further back than last season – he said that Vinícius had a “motorbike in his boots” so why wouldn’t you play on the counter? After the PSG game, though, he agreed: they would step up. Athletic Bilbao 2-0 Atlético Madrid, Valencia 1-1 Levante, Real Madrid 4-0 Espanyol, Aláves 2-1 Villarreal, Barcelona 2-1 Real Mallorca, Rayo Vallecano 1-1 Real Sociedad, Granada 1-1 Celta Vigo, Elche 1-1 Osasuna He admitted mistakes, but said: “I can get it wrong once; I tend not to get it wrong twice.” When he was accused of suffering Benzema dependencia, he said he was proud to depend on the world’s best player. When Marco Asensio got angry, he said: “Good.” The next match Asensio scored a hat-trick and he wondered who to annoy next. When Kroos was angry at being replaced, Ancelotti turned to a recurring line he likes: “He got annoyed with the manager, not the man.” He reminded everyone of something a footballer had said to him, his understanding revealed: “The player who’s not pissed off at not playing is not a player at all.” When Dani Ceballos wanted more minutes, he said: “He’s right; I’ve been unfair.” Empathy reached players, who adore him, play for him, won the league with him. One line stands out, even if few seemed to hear it. “I listen to my players,” he said, something so often seen as a weakness instead projected as a what it actually is: a strength. On Saturday night, once the plan had come together and as the open-topped bus edged down the Castellana with the league title on board, past Nuevos Ministerios and the science museum, beyond Colón and on to Cibeles, Carlo Ancelotti pulled on a pair of sunglasses and sucked on a gigantic cigar, the portrait of what he had done and how he had done it. “The Boss,” Vinícius called him.",Sport/Football,Real Madrid step up when it matters to seal Ancelotti’s grand slam of titles | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/02/real-madrid-seal-carlo-ancelotti-grand-slam-titles-la-liga
5/3/2022,"Earlier today I set you this problem from last year’s British Mathematical Olympiad (BMO), the UK’s top maths competition for pre-university students, which is taken by almost 2,000 teenagers a year. The question was attempted by 90 per cent of the contestants, and about 1 in 3 got full marks. How did you get on? Ping pong percentages Arun and Disha played several games of table tennis. At five points during the day, Arun calculated the percentage of the games played so far that he had won. The results of these calculations were exactly 30 per cent, exactly 40 per cent, exactly 50 per cent, exactly 60 per cent and exactly 70 per cent, but not necessarily in that order. What is the smallest possible number of games they played? Here’s a hint. Arun wins one of the first two games. Solution 30 Here’s how you might have gone about it. First, let G be the smallest possible number of games. If at any stage Arun has won 30 per cent of the games he played, then we can write the equation: W/G = 3/10 where W are the games he has won at that stage. We can rearrange this equation as 10W = 3G, from which we can deduce that G must be a multiple of 10. However we also know that there is a point at which he has won 70 per cent of games. In other words there is a w such that 10w = 7G. We can eliminate the chance that G = 10, since if it was then this would mean that after ten games Arun has won both 3 and 7 games, which is impossible. Let’s say G = 20. Then either (i) after 10 games he has won 3 of them, and after 20 games he has won 14 of them, or (ii) after 10 games he has won 7 of them and after 20 games he has won 6 of them. [This is because we are only going to achieve the 30 per cent, and 70 per cent, of wins when the games played is divisible by 10] Both (i) and (ii) are impossible. (i) because there are not enough games to go from 3 to 14 wins in 10 games, and (ii) because you can’t go from 7 wins to 6. Now let’s try with G = 30. I told you that Arun wins now of the first two games. So, after two games his running total of wins/games is 1/2, which is 50 per cent. Let’s now rewrite the other percentages required as fractions: 30, 40, 60 and 70 per cent are 3/10, 2/5, 3/5 and 7/10. Let’s say that after winning 1/2, Arun wins one of the next three. That get’s him to 2/5, when he will have won 40 per cent. If he wins one of the next five, that get’s him to 3/10, which is 30 per cent. If he wins nine of the next ten, that get’s him to 12/20, which is 60 per cent. If he wins another nine of the next ten, he finishes with 21/30, which is 70 per cent. We’re done! G = 30.

5/3/2022,"Swiss politicians will debate the future of the country’s controversial banking secrecy law this week, as it faces pressure from UN officials to scrap rules under which whistleblowers and journalists who report on potential wrongdoing can be prosecuted. A committee in Switzerland’s parliament could put forward proposals by Friday that would amend the banking secrecy law – known as article 47 – which makes it a criminal offence to disclose information about a bank’s clients, even if it is in the public interest to do so. It comes amid mounting international pressure to repeal the law, including from the United Nations special rapporteur for freedom of opinion and expression, Irene Khan, who said article 47 violated international law and human rights. “This is normally a problem in authoritarian states,” she said. Khan, who has written to the Swiss government on the matter, is planning to escalate her concerns regarding article 47 to the UN’s human rights council next month. Her intervention following an investigation by a consortium of international media outlets, including the Guardian, into Switzerland’s second largest bank, Credit Suisse. The leak, which included data for 30,000 clients, revealed that the bank held accounts for individuals involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption, and other serious crimes, over decades. However, Switzerland’s extreme banking secrecy laws meant that journalists who took part in the investigation, known as the Suisse secrets project, risked potential fines or even imprisonment. Swiss media could not take part as a result. It prompted Khan to write to the Swiss government, demanding they explain how the laws aligned with the country’s commitment to human rights. “The blanket protection of banking secrecy in Switzerland violates international law,” Khan told reporters from Tamedia and Der Spiegel, who were involved in the Suisse secrets project. She said Swiss banking secrecy laws were incompatible with two international conventions – article 19 of the international covenant on civil and political rights, and article 10 of the European convention on human rights – which together guarantee freedom of expression and the press. “Switzerland has signed both and is obliged to uphold them,” she said. Khan added that the Swiss government was “in a difficult position to explain why publishing information that could reveal financial crimes should be punished with up to three years in prison. Especially when journalists and whistleblowers point out real problems in a bank. The law should not criminalise that.” Article 47 has existed since the early 20th century, but was expanded in 2015 to include third parties such as journalists and whistleblowers, after a number of cases where client data was shared with to foreign tax authorities. That famously included a CD of data from HSBC Private Bank Suisse that was subsequently accessed by journalists. Supporters of the law have previously cited clients’ rights to privacy. However, Khan said: “Convicted criminals and politically exposed persons have a right to privacy but not when there is good ground to believe they may be involved in financial wrongdoing.” Credit Suisse said in February that it could not comment on specific clients due to the same banking secrecy laws but “strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices”. The special rapporteur said the Swiss government had since responded to her letter, first sent in March, claiming it was fully committed to freedom of expression and that no journalist had ever been prosecuted under the law, which they said was now under review. A Swiss government spokesperson said they expected the full response to be published next week. In the meantime, the Swiss parliamentary subcommittee on economy and taxes is to review article 47 and the findings from the Suisse secrets investigation from 5 May. The subcommittee could put forward a motion that could amend the law as early as Friday. But barring a major overhaul, Khan will escalate the issue to the UN human rights council on 24 June. She plans to present officials with a new report on press freedoms that will “critically address” article 47 and the criminalisation of journalism that she says is typically observed in authoritarian regimes. “Switzerland is a champion of human rights and press freedom, and participates actively in the UN human rights council. It has repeatedly denounced the actions of other countries against journalists. That is why it is important that Switzerland now reacts itself and changes such a problematic law. Switzerland must not only preach. It must also act,” she said.",News/News,Swiss consider amending banking secrecy laws amid UN pressure,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/02/swiss-consider-amending-banking-secrecy-laws-amid-un-pressure
5/3/2022,"Buns N Roses, the cheeky opening number in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cinderella, sets the scene in Belleville, imagined by writer Emerald Fennell as an “aggressively picturesque” place whose supremely buffed citizens keep their dirty laundry out of sight. “We’re so dependent on the tourist trade to fill our cupboards and our coffers,” observe the chorus of the town, before the Queen unveils a grand statue. “Should be a luc-ra-tive att-ract-tion” she predicts in a contented staccato. But after a troubled run that included umpteen opening night postponements and a shutdown of several weeks amid the Omicron crisis, Lloyd Webber’s latest attraction is to close early, despite London tourism beginning to bounce back from its 2020-21 lows and the West End’s footfall slowly returning towards pre-pandemic levels. Cinderella had been booking until February next year and the announcement on Sunday night of its closure next month came as a surprise to many of the cast and crew, including several actors who had been about to join the company and who expressed their shock on social media. Among them was Daisy Twells who said she had spent weeks going in and out of London for rounds of auditions, had been trying to find a place to live and had mapped out the next year of her life in what would have been her first West End show. Summer Strallen, who had been due to take over the role of the Queen and went for a wig fitting as recently as last week, said that her diary was also now unexpectedly and alarmingly empty. A spokesperson for Lloyd Webber’s Really Useful Group said that “everyone involved in Cinderella was contacted by call, email or in person (some through agents) before the news went live in the evening” and that “every effort was made to ensure people were notified before it went live”. But for several of the show’s newest recruits, tweets and news stories about the closure reached them before their official notice did. Bear in mind that this was a bank holiday weekend: informing a huge number of workers, simultaneously, of such upsetting news requires great consideration and careful timing – why choose Sunday before a public holiday? The fact that some of the leads were already leaving the show soon does not make the situation any easier for the company. And what a company they are. I was at the Gillian Lynne theatre again on Saturday afternoon to see the show for a second time after it left me giddy on opening night in August. I wondered if it would have the same effect and, if anything, I enjoyed it even more. In the lead role, Carrie Hope Fletcher is a phenomenon (I’d forgotten she has quite so many solos) and Ivano Turco, who only graduated in the summer of 2020, is a fantastic Prince Sebastian, navigating his feelings for his childhood mucker Cinderella as well as his unease with royal duties. Turco’s solo, Only You, Lonely You, is delivered tenderly and the jesting duets he and Fletcher share are a delight. Gloria Onitiri is in such blazing voice as the Godmother that you long for her to have a bigger part. Victoria Hamilton-Barritt – inexplicably the only cast or creative from the show to earn an Olivier nomination – is still a haughty hoot as the Stepmother, while Georgina Castle and Laura Baldwin are a double whammy of wicked vanity as her daughters. They get some of Fennell’s prickliest lines and, in the helter-skelter song Unfair, relish some of David Zippel’s snappiest lyrics too. Throw in Rebecca Trehearn’s Queen, with an incestuous lust for her strapping son Prince Charming, and you think how unfortunate it was that this most panto of musicals was closed for so much of the festive period through concerns about the Omicron variant. The show earned five- and four-star reviews in August and the matinee I saw – alongside several others who had already seen the show once – ended with a standing ovation in the packed stalls. But the booking system shows lots of seats are still empty for the remaining shows. How come? Its stop-start run won’t have helped build an audience and, while many saw the composer as theatrical Marmite already, his declarations last year about risking arrest to open the show at full capacity won’t have endeared him to many. Ticket prices aren’t the key issue: there are two ticket bands under £20 with lots of those seats still left. There are certainly issues of confidence about returning to theatres when the majority of an audience is unmasked; I didn’t see very many masks at Cinderella. Other mega musicals, including Lloyd Webber’s own masked avenger, in The Phantom of the Opera, and hits such as Hamilton, are also showing plenty of available seats this week. So is another fairytale, Frozen, but I wonder if part of the problem with Cinderella is how, unlike that Disney juggernaut, it isn’t targeted squarely at a young audience. Belleville is a barbed, bitchy place with thrusting bare-chested “hunks” bragging about their sexual conquests. You might think twice about taking kids along; equally, an adult audience may well wonder if it’s a family-focused show rather than the filthy, rip-roaring (if occasionally moving) night that it is. This time I sat in the revolve section of the stalls which, in the second half, spins you around during a waltz scene so that you end up underneath the set’s rococo frame, watching the show as if on stage. It’s the sort of coup de théâtre that you’d imagine would have helped to win audiences back when the industry was promoting the unrivalled thrill of live entertainment during the pandemic. Cinderella became a much-publicised flagship show for that task, a brand new musical in the commercial sector which had far less help from the government’s Culture Recovery Fund than subsidised theatres. “We led the charge to reopen the West End,” said Lloyd Webber in his statement about the early closure. But the way that closure was handled suggests the industry has a long way to go if it really wants to “build back better”.

5/3/2022,"A multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency company has apologised to users after its sale of “metaverse land” sparked a frenzy that temporarily brought down the Ethereum cryptocurrency. Yuga Labs, the company behind the Bored Ape NFTs beloved of Jimmy Fallon and Paris Hilton, announced the sale of its latest tokens – representing plots of land in a forthcoming multiplayer game called Otherside – on Sunday. A total of 55,000 plots were sold, at a flat price of 305 ApeCoin (a currency created by Yuga), which is worth about £4,500 at current exchange rates. Demand for the plots was so high that it overwhelmed the Ethereum blockchain, a layer of infrastructure that all cryptocurrency projects rely on to operate. As users raced to be one of the lucky few able to secure an “Otherdeed”, transaction fees on the network rose higher and higher, until an individual NFT purchase cost more than £2,500 in fees alone. One user, who successfully secured two Otherdeeds, paid a transaction fee of over 5 ETH (£11,000) on top of the £9,000 to buy the land itself. Others lost thousands of pounds failing to secure the tokens at all: if a user runs out money while paying the transaction fees, the transaction fails, but the fees aren’t refunded. For most of those who secured Yuga’s latest token, the eye-watering fees have paid off, at least in the short term: tokens that sold for £4,500 are already reselling for more than £9,000. But people who were unlucky enough to be trying to carry out other cryptocurrency business at the same time have racked up hefty losses. Molly White, a cryptocurrency expert who runs a site chronicling the sector, tracked multiple examples over the day of NFT sales worth less than £500 being hit with transaction fees of more than £2,000. $3,300 transaction fee for a $25 NFT(not a typo—they paid a transaction fee that was more than 100x as much as the NFT) pic.twitter.com/mzNGMpAcGa “Gas fees, which increase based on network congestion, spiked to shocking levels,” White wrote. While most sales on OpenSea, the most popular marketplace for NFTs, were for Otherside deeds, “some people oddly continued to buy and sell cheaper NFTs”, she added. In total, more than $100m was spent on transaction fees to buy Otherside NFTs, while Yuga Labs took another $300m in payments. When the sale was over, the company apologised for the chaos it had caused. “We know that the Otherdeed mint was unprecedented in its size as a high-demand NFT collection, and that would bring with it unique challenges. “This has been the largest NFT mint in history by several multiples, and yet the gas used during the mint shows that demand far exceeded anyone’s wildest expectations. The scale of this mint was so large that Etherscan crashed,” Yuga added, referring to a cryptocurrency analytics website. “We’re sorry for turning off the lights on Ethereum for a while.” The company had already faced one crisis thanks to the Otherdeed sale: a fake post on its hacked Instagram page, announcing free metaverse land, led to a phishing campaign that stole $3m worth of NFTs. Some argued that the ramifications of such a comparatively small sale was evidence that the cryptocurrency sector would struggle to scale to provide services to the mainstream. “There’s much talk about the promise of web3. But at this rate, any non-web3 sales mechanism works with ~100x less wasted fees,” wrote Gergely Orosz, a prominent technology commentator. “If it’s too expensive to use, or it’s unreliable: this is something alpha at best, not ready for mainstream use.”",News/Technology,Yuga Labs apologises after sale of virtual land crashes Ethereum,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/02/yuga-labs-apologises-after-sale-of-virtual-land-crashes-ethereum
5/3/2022,"A first group of civilians trapped for weeks inside Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks were expected to reach a Ukrainian-held city on Monday, but efforts to save more people from the horrific conditions inside the huge plant were held up. Hundreds remain trapped in underground bunkers and tunnels beneath the sprawling industrial site – the last stronghold of resistance to Russia’s siege of the devastated southern port city – which Moscow’s forces resumed shelling overnight. Ukraine’s defence ministry said its drones had destroyed two small Russian Raptor patrol boats in the Black Sea, while the governor of the Russian region of Belgorod reported two explosions in the early hours, the latest in a string of fires and blasts in recent weeks at ammunition stores and fuel depots in the area. A Russian rocket strike hit a strategically important bridge across the Dniester estuary west of the port of Odesa, authorities said, while Moscow claimed to have also destroyed an airport runway and a hangar containing western-supplied weapons and ammunition outside the south-western city. Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
5/3/2022,"The House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack on Monday asked three Republican members of Congress to assist its inquiry, as it seeks to establish the extent of their roles in Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election. The panel sent letters requesting voluntary cooperation to Mo Brooks, Andy Biggs and Ronny Jackson, three congressmen who strategised ways to stop certification of Joe Biden’s election win or appeared to have connections to elements involved in the Capitol attack. Bennie Thompson, the Democratic committee chair, told the Guardian last week the panel wanted to conduct interviews with Republicans so it could consider their testimony for its report, due to be published in September. The panel opted against issuing subpoenas compelling testimony in the first instance, since that could cause the Republicans to attack, whereas an informal interview might at least yield some information, two sources close to the matter said. House investigators are expected to issue further letters to Republican members of Congress, the sources said. The Guardian first reported the committee was considering letters to Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and Paul Gosar, in addition to Biggs and Brooks. The panel made a particularly expansive request to Biggs, the former head of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, outlining four lines of inquiry that investigators want to pursue with respect to his role in the weeks before January 6. Thompson told Biggs the committee wanted to ask him about a crucial 21 December meeting at the White House between Trump and dozens of Republicans, which produced a plan to have the then vice-president, Mike Pence, refuse to certify Biden’s win. The letter also said the panel wanted to ask what Biggs knew of plans to stage a march from the Ellipse, near the White House, to the Capitol on January 6, through his purported contacts with the pro-Trump activist Ali Alexander, who led the “Stop the Steal movement” after the 2020 election. Biggs’ potential contacts with Alexander are of special interest to the investigation, the sources said. The committee is trying to untangle claims by Alexander that he “schemed up putting maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting” with Brooks, Biggs, and Gosar, and his testimony that he spoke to Biggs’ staff and the congressman himself. Alexander obtained a permit for a 6 January rally near the Capitol and encouraged the crowd to go in the direction of Capitol Hill. But the rally never took place and Alexander was instead filmed going up the Capitol steps with members of the Oath Keepers militia group. Thompson said the panel also wanted to ask Biggs about his efforts to pressure legislators to create “alternate” slates of electors for Trump in states he lost, as well as an alleged request he made to Trump for a pardon in the days after the Capitol attack. In a letter to Brooks, the select committee said it wanted to ask him about his recent public comments, how Trump supposedly asked him on several occasions to “help rescind the election” and that “we’ve got to take Joe Biden down and put me in now”. In the letter to Jackson, the panel indicated they would ask Trump’s former White House physician about why his name came up in encrypted text messages among members of the Oath Keepers as the Capitol attack was underway. According to text messages in a recent court filing, an unidentified Oath Keeper messaged a group chat in the afternoon of January 6 that “Ronnie Jackson (TX) office inside Capitol – he needs OK help. Anyone inside?” The same Oath Keeper provided an update less than 10 minutes later: “Dr Ronnie Jackson – on the move. Needs protection. If anyone inside cover him. He has critical data to protect.” The Oath Keepers leader, Stewart Rhodes, responded: “Give him my cell.” The extraordinary exchange raises the notion that members of the Oath Keepers – two of whom are among those who have been indicted on charges of seditious conspiracy for storming the Capitol – were close enough to Jackson to know his whereabouts and condition in real time. To that extent, the letter to Jackson said, the select committee wants to ask him about whether he had contacts with the Oath Keepers, how the militia group could have known that he needed protection or, in another text, knew he had “critical data to protect”.",News/US news,Capitol attack committee requests cooperation from key Republican trio,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/02/capitol-attack-republicans-mo-brooks-andy-biggs-ronny-jackson
5/3/2022,"John Oliver delved into environmental racism in the US, in which, like many things, the effects of toxic pollution disproportionately effect people of color, particularly black Americans. The Last Week Tonight host cited studies which found that black Americans are exposed to 38% more polluted air and are 75% more likely to live in communities that border a plant or factory. Those disparities hold when controlled for income; black Americans making $200,000 annually were exposed to more air pollution than white Americans making $25,000, “proving that yet again, racism is one of the few things in this country more powerful than money,” Oliver noted. “In fact, I believe America’s current top five power rankings go: racism, beef, viral videos of soldiers reuniting with their dogs, DJ Khaled’s PR team and then money.” Oliver explored how this happened, and how pervasive the issue is today, starting with the history of redlining, AKA federal policies which prevented black Americans from obtaining government-backed home loans where white people lived. The areas where they could live were often also zoned for industrial uses, essentially overlaying the maps of communities of color and industrial waste zones. “But history and zoning are only part of the story here, because it also is about who is has the power to push back,” Oliver continued, “and polluters often assume that black communities in particular won’t be able to stop them. “Sometimes, pollution can be invisible. And those that you’d expect to warn you about that can be incredibly slow to do so when it comes to communities of color.” Oliver cited the example of the West Calumet housing complex in East Chicago, Indiana, a federally assisted housing community built on top of a former lead smelter. The lead levels surrounding the complex were dangerously off the charts for years, up to 200 times the emergency levels. “Which just isn’t great when the place that you found it is the ground,” said Oliver, “a place notoriously difficult to avoid unless, that is, you’re willing to spend the rest of your life playing a very high-stakes version of the floor is lava.” Even worse, the government knew the area under and around the housing complex was dangerously toxic for decades before it informed residents. Oliver cited government reports on lead toxicity in the area in 1985, 1998 and 2009, when the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declared West Calumet a Superfund site and prioritized it for cleanup and still didn’t notify residents because federal law doesn’t require its agencies to tell tenants that a unit is located on a Superfund site. “Which I truly cannot wrap my head around,” said Oliver. “The whole point of Superfund is to officially classify something in the government record as very dangerous,” he added. “So it is not great to do that and then not tell the people actually at risk. It’s like putting a ‘Do Not Lean Over the Fence’ sign at a bear exhibit and having it face the bear side. Sure, the information is technically out there, but it’s not really doing much to improve public safety.” The government finally notified residents in 2016 – 31 years and eight government agencies later. “And even then, the steps the government took were utterly pathetic,” Oliver said, including yard signs warning children not to play in the dirt or grass. “We all know there is nothing children respect more than the authority of a flimsy sign,” he deadpanned. The West Calumet example is extreme but telling, as 70% of hazardous waste sites on the Superfund list are located within one mile of federally assisted housing. And “without significant changes, our whole system is currently set up so that places that have already been polluted get worse and worse”. Those areas are literally termed environmental “sacrifice zones”, such as Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, where the cancer risk is more than 50 times the national average. “When you put all of this together – a history of racist zoning, ineffective regulation and a government that continues to prioritize the profits of industry over the health of people – it is clear we have a massive problem,” Oliver said. The Biden administration has named environmental racism as a priority, but also said race will not be a factor in deciding where to focus efforts. “Which is pretty fucking infuriating,” said Oliver. The conservative-majority supreme court is likely to strike down an explicitly race-based policy, which leaves the US “in a pretty fucking backwards situation. When any solutions to this problem have to be race-blind, despite the fact that the causes of it are so demonstrably not.” Oliver called for more support for local activists and intense zoning reform for an “unacceptable” status quo. “When this country designates communities of color as ‘sacrifice zones’ the clear message there is that the people who live in them are expendable,” he said. “That it’s OK for their kids to not be able to play outside and for their lifespans to be shorter. “And unless we take big steps to address environmental racism and call it what it is, a brutal divide is going to stay in place in this country where some are treated like they’re worth protecting, and others like they can be sacrificed.",Arts/Television & radio,John Oliver on environmental racism: ‘It’s clear we have a massive problem’,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/02/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-recap-environmental-racism
5/3/2022,"More than two months after they were unveiled, the government’s student loan changes have now been reviewed and analysed in detail, with experts concluding they will be a gamechanger for higher education in England – but not in the way ministers hope. The long-awaited response to the Augar review of post-18 education and funding, published in February, included 40-year payback periods and higher repayment terms. While these are unlikely to stop middle-class teenagers from aiming for a degree, those from less advantaged backgrounds may hold back, imperilling the supply of graduates in key sectors such as teaching and nursing, experts have concluded. Analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) thinktank found that lower-middle- and middle-income graduates would be hardest hit, paying £30,000 more than current graduates, with repayments spread over 40 years. But graduates in the highest income brackets will pay £20,000 less as the progressive elements of the existing loan package are stripped away. The IFS also found that proposals under consideration to restrict loans to those with minimum exam grades could have a dramatic effect on who goes to university. Imposing a requirement of GCSE passes in English and maths might have stopped 10% of recent undergraduates accessing loans – in effect barring most of them from campus. The IFS found the majority would be from disadvantaged families or ethnic minorities, precisely the groups that successive governments have encouraged to consider higher education. Claire Crawford, of University College London’s Institute of Education, said government and taxpayers would be “massively reducing the amount of investment that they are providing” by recouping more from graduates. The proportion of graduates repaying their loans in full could rise from 25% to nearly 75%, according to the IFS. But whether the new repayment regime will deter future students in England depends on their calculations of whether or not they will be better off. “Those who might expect to go on and be relatively high-earning, you would think that they would be even more incentivised to go to university as a result of this, because their repayments are predicted to go down,” Crawford said. “If you’re at the lower end of the spectrum, I guess it’s a more marginal decision. But it’s not totally obvious.” Crawford noted that many students chose subjects and courses that had a low return in terms of earnings, suggesting reasons other than income were behind their decision. “What we can conclude is that the [existing] sticker price did not seem to put people off. So whether they’re paying sufficient attention to these kind of underlying changes, which affect future payments, is not clear,” she said. The vice-chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, Chris Husbands, said there were two views among his colleagues about the potential effects. “The first view is that none of this is going to have any impact, that the cultural predisposition to go to university as a way of improving yourself is so deeply entrenched, that the changes to the loan regime will not significantly impact the demand for places. “View No 2 is that this cultural predisposition is much stronger among the middle classes than among poorer households, and that while none of these interventions are likely to be decisive in themselves, the drip, drip, drip of this is likely to have an effect on families in places like east Barnsley [reinforcing historically low rates of participation].” Husbands thinks ministers are less interested in widening participation “because they think the job has been done” and are more concerned about cost, with current forecasts of a 26% increase in student numbers over the next decade. As a result Husbands says policymakers are like hotel guests in an unfamiliar shower, alternating between being too hot and too cold while nervously adjusting the taps. “What worries me about all of this is that the deteriorating terms of trade on student loans, the minimum eligibility requirements and so on, are a whole series of interventions that have the impact of getting us back to a 1940s or 1950s world, where essentially universities are full of middle-class people, and poorer people don’t get in,” he said. Husbands said he could accept the case for minimum eligibility requirements, but they could act as barriers to the most disadvantaged because of England’s highly unequal results at school level. “But I don’t think the sector has got its brain around it yet.” While the government has been improving its financial position, it has done little to help students whose maintenance loans are falling in real terms. University funding through tuition fees, stuck at £9,250 since 2016, has also been eroded by inflation despite government increasing teaching grants in some high-priority subjects such as health. Robin Mason, the pro-vice-chancellor at the University of Birmingham, said the extended fee freeze could lead to a rebalancing between more selective universities and the rest of the sector, reversing the trend of the last decade that has resulted in selective universities taking a greater proportion of students. “I think you can bet on the more selective universities not looking to expand their domestic undergraduate numbers,” Mason said. “One part of government policy restricts supply at the top end and another part says it doesn’t want ‘lower-value’ courses. And there’s going to be a collision between those two but it’s a collision that’s being forced by different arms of policy.” A spokesperson for the Russell Group of universities said frozen fees, rising costs and demand for places would “inevitably start to impact on quality and choice for students, particularly for those subjects with the highest teaching costs” such as nursing and engineering. “To protect the pipeline of high-level skills and jobs that will be crucial to our economic recovery, we would urge government to work with the sector and find a long-term, financially sustainable approach to funding higher education and which continues to widen access to university,” the spokesperson said.",News/Education,Student loan changes in England ‘could imperil supply of teachers and nurses’,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/02/student-loan-changes-england-imperil-supply-teachers-nurses
5/3/2022,"The slip-ups and car-crash interviews of Nadine Dorries, the secretary of state for culture, such as her reference to “downstreaming” films, provide regular fodder for satirists and social media users alike, but the problem is that these clips are distractions from the real substance of what she is doing – and the privatisation of Channel 4 is no joke. Privatisation in some form has been mooted about half a dozen times since the channel’s launch in 1982, but no one has managed to get as close as this government, which is pressing ahead with its sale. There are doubts over whether it will have the political backing to pass the legislation required to sell off the broadcaster, but Dorries is defending the plans, not by the brilliance of her argument, but by being less than entirely clear about the facts. Channel 4, which celebrates its 40th birthday this year, is a strange beast: a state-owned broadcaster funded by private-sector advertising, but with a commitment, or remit, to show the sort of public-service content (the news, the Paralympics, regional voices) that is largely unprofitable and then to reinvest profits into new programming. On the day the white paper to privatise the channel was published, listeners to Iain Dale’s LBC radio show heard Dorries say that investment in the broadcasting rival Channel 5 increased after it was “privatised … three years ago, five years ago maybe”. Channel 5 has never been publicly owned and therefore could never have been privatised. When the error was pointed out, Dorries doubled down. She said criticism was “nit-picking” after she “misspoke” the date, suggesting that failing to remember when Channel 5 was sold (2014) was the problem and not the fact she had failed to understand the channel’s ownership model. Everyone is allowed to make mistakes, but the interview was hardly unusual. She wrote a column for the Mail on Sunday headlined, “Predictably, the Leftie lynch mob refuses to accept what is best for British TV”. In it Dorries trumpets the fact that “Channel 4 decreased the amount it spent on new content by £158m” but downplayed the fact that this decline happened in 2020, an exceptional year for everyone, and that the broadcaster’s spending has been back above 2019 levels ever since. Dorries opines that Margaret Thatcher wanted to privatise the channel, citing the former prime minister’s 1988 memoir, yet she fails to mention the fact that subsequent meetings dissuaded Thatcher from this view. This was partly economic – with no in-house production, Channel 4 has pump-primed a thriving independent production sector in the UK since the 1980s – but Thatcher was also convinced that the bill was likely to be defeated. Minutes held in the National Archives read: “In both Houses, a proposal to privatise Channel 4 was likely to be vulnerable to defeat.” Dorries likes to suggest that media luvvies are the ones criticising her plans, yet 96% of the responses to the government’s own consultation paper were against privatisation. Dorries called this “politically motivated organisation” by polling group 38 Degrees, which doesn’t explain why many members of her own party, including Julian Knight, Jeremy Hunt and Damian Green, are against the plans. So why would the government want to push this privatisation now? It can’t be just because it needs the sale proceeds, because Dorries has promised to reinvest them. Dorries denies that her motivations are political – yet she still derides the Channel 4 “anchor … shouting eff the Tories” at every opportunity. It’s hard not to believe that Boris Johnson and his team are turning the heat up on Channel 4 in revenge for its political coverage, including replacing him with a melting ice sculpture when he failed to turn up for a climate crisis debate.

5/3/2022,"The paper wine bottle is one of the biggest ideas since the screw top but as pecorino in a brown paper eco-bottle arrives at Ocado, there’s one thing to remember, try not to get it wet. The £11 white, from the sustainable wine brand When in Rome, goes on sale this week, and is the first wine in a paper bottle to be sold in a mainstream UK supermarket. Even if the bottle does become damp, all is not lost, says Rob Malin, the company’s founder, because the wine is safe in a recyclable plastic pouch inside. While glass bottles have been part of the wine-drinking tradition for centuries, making the material requires huge amounts of energy at a time when companies are looking for ways to reduce the carbon footprint of their products. Recycling rates for glass are also poor. “Great wine doesn’t have to come in glass bottles,” Malin says, explaining the leap of faith he is asking wine drinkers to take. “Whether you’re drinking from a glass bottle or a paper bottle, the quality of the wine is not impacted.” However, he cautions, don’t put the paper bottle in an ice bucket. “It will go soggy. You need to use a dry chiller.” The bottle, made by the sustainable packaging firm Frugalpac, is 94% recycled paper and has a carbon footprint that is about a sixth of a single-use glass bottle. At the moment it costs about the same as a glass one but the maths are moving in its favour because of soaring glass prices as well as shortages linked to higher energy costs and the war in Ukraine, where some factories have closed. “The production of glass involves huge amounts of energy, so the cost of glass bottles is going sky-high,” said Malcolm Waugh, Frugalpac’s chief executive. “In some instances it is two to three times the price but it depends on who you are, and the type of bottle. Certainly there’s a 30 to 40% increase.” Waugh says Frugalpac’s sales are up fivefold this year, with the firm being inundated with inquiries for the paper bottles, which can also be used for spirits and olive oil. “We’ve taken some big orders that will be coming out later this year.” Ceri Parke, a co-owner of the Cantina Goccia winery in Umbria, agrees there is a shortage of glass and the price is going up. Her winery uses glass and paper bottles but she says: “You can’t just get the glass bottles you’re used to getting. For a bottling we did three weeks ago, I had to use a bottle that I wouldn’t normally use. The consumer probably won’t notice the difference but the other one is not available.” When in Rome is also trying to convince Britons to try other, greener wine containers such as box wine or cans. These “alt-formats” unfairly get a “bad rap”, Malin says. “People think bag-in-box wine is crap. It’s ridiculous because most Australian wine comes here in huge bag-in-boxes.” The paper bottle has a higher carbon footprint than its box wine but Malin says it means it can go “head to head with glass, and let the consumer decide for themselves about alt-format wines”.",News/Business,Glass dismissed: wine goes green with paper bottle drive,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/02/glass-dismissed-wine-goes-green-with-paper-bottle-drive-ocado
