4/25/2022,"Nothing is yet settled in this season’s Premiership but several things became clearer on a breezy day in north London as Saracens secured their playoff place. The most glaring is that it will take something special to beat Sarries on their own artificial pitch if they do secure a home semi‑final draw while fifth-placed Exeter now have it all to do simply to be involved in the knockout stages. There was also no ignoring the contribution of Owen Farrell as his team scored 28 second-half points to turn a 15-10 half-time deficit into a significant bonus-point victory which has propelled them within four points of leaders Leicester. “Phenomenal” and “incredible” were two of the words used by Mark McCall to describe his captain and there was no disputing the steely influence which rightly earned Farrell the award for player of the match. With three games left, starting with a trip to Worcester this weekend, it is also worth noting that Maro Itoje sat out this fixture while Max Malins was forced to drop out on the eve of the match. McCall also believes Farrell, having missed a big chunk of rugby through injury, has plenty of improvement still left in him. “His passing and his kicking and his offloads – all of that was phenomenal, really,” McCall said. “In terms of what he did during the game he was outstanding but emotionally he was incredible. He hasn’t played many games for us in the Premiership so it’s great to have him back. He looked OK to me today but he’s going to get better.” The wind blowing straight down the field inevitably played its part in Sarries’ increasingly strong performance but this was also a game which neatly summed up Exeter’s whole season. At times they looked purposeful and slick with the ball, with Henry Slade having a decent game at fly-half, but they just could not sustain those periods of excellence for long enough. As against Munster in Europe, they also struggled to capitalise on all the chances they created, leaving them in danger of not making the final four after six straight final appearances. “It was probably one of our best attacking performances in a lot of ways, other than getting over the try line,” said Rob Baxter, the Exeter director of rugby. At least Jack Nowell’s impending wedding – only rugby players get married on a Monday – offers some temporary distraction but Baxter, who is now giving his players 10 days off, is not yet conceding his side’s race is run. “We’ll know exactly where we are after next week’s round. It wouldn’t surprise me at all if we’re in a position where two wins will see us through to fourth spot.” Two bonus-point victories, at Bristol and at home against Harlequins will almost certainly be required, however, with a five‑point half-time lead here always looking skinny for a side lacking Sam Simmonds, Luke Cowan‑Dickie, Jonny Hill, Harry Williams and Dave Ewers, all of them either injured or rested. Despite their early possession and territory it was Sarries who scored the game’s first try, Aled Davies putting Elliot Daly clean through a midfield hole to complete a slick first-phase strike move from a lineout. With what felt like a 10-point lead at their backs, Exeter needed a good second quarter and, upping the tempo accordingly, the points began to come. A series of calculated blindside raids down the left touchline yielded a score for Sam Skinner before the faithful Ian Whitten delivered a deliciously timed little pass to a flying Olly Woodburn to put the visitors 15-10 up. Some interesting decisions from the referee Craig Maxwell-Keys, however, helped to slow their momentum and Sarries, with Farrell kicking seven out of eight, steadily took the initiative. Maitland spotted a mismatch to surge over for his third’s third try and another line-break from Rotimi Segun put Ben Earl away for the bonus point with 11 minutes left. Stu Townsend did grab a late consolation but, despite Stuart Hogg throwing one ball into touch and another at Whitten’s toes with space beckoning, Saracens’ defensive application deserved its reward. “Our desire to roll our sleeves up in our own 22 and not allow them to score was a really pleasing part of our performance,” McCall said. Baxter, though, does not accept Exeter are now a spent force. “If finishing fourth or fifth is a reset year for us, a hell of a lot of clubs would take that. There have been a lot of clubs who have spent 10 years bumbling along the bottom as a reset.”",Sport/Sport,Owen Farrell guides Saracens to handsome win over Exeter and playoffs,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/24/saracens-exeter-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
4/25/2022,"A California family spent the winter dismissing odd noises that sounded a little like snoring, only to discover that five bears had spent the cold season hibernating under their house. The Bear League group, which works to preserve bear habitat and help bears in distress largely around the Lake Tahoe basin region in the state, recounted the family’s astonishing episode last week. In a Facebook post, the group described how one mother bear, along with three of her own cubs and an adopted orphan, had decided to spend the winter in the crawlspace under a local house. “It was a home where people lived, and they thought they heard some odd rumbling, snoring-like noises but ignored it because it simply didn’t make sense … and the neighbors said they were imagining it because they didn’t hear anything,” the Bear League said in a Facebook post. It added: “The bear family awoke and prepared to exit, and the people in the house could no longer deny there was probably a bear under the house.” The unnamed residents called the Bear League, who helped usher the bear family into the woods, as well as making sure the human family in the house was also unharmed.",News/US news,California family discovers five bears hibernating in crawlspace under home,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/24/california-family-bears-hibernating-under-home
4/25/2022,"Ninety years ago, the Kinder Scout mass trespass took place, a protest on the highest point in the Peak District in which walkers mainly from Greater Manchester trespassed en masse calling for greater access to the moorlands.The mass trespass was instrumental in leading to the passage of national parks legislation and helped pave the way for the establishment of Britain’s first long-distance footpath, the Pennine Way. But the dreams of those trespassers have still not been fulfilled. In 2000 the Countryside and Rights of Way Act established a partial right to roam in England and Wales, yet it covers just 8% of England, with the rest still privately owned and inaccessible to the public. This month the government quashed a review of the right to roam in England’s countryside. The environment minister Rebecca Pow says there are no plans to release results of the review, a decision condemned by campaigners. Speaking on Saturday at a memorial event in Hayfield, Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion, said the decision was “disappointing” and “frankly shameful”. The historic event of the Kinder mass trespass parallels issues of access to the great outdoors that are now faced by people of colour and those from working-class backgrounds. The British countryside is demographically more white than cities, with a Natural England study showing that only 1% of visitors to national parks are from BAME backgrounds. A 2019 Defra landscapes review of national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty (AONB) said: “It has felt as if national parks are an exclusive, mainly white, mainly middle‐class club.” The review proposed systemic reform of the governance of national park and AONB boards, stating that only a “tiny fraction” on such boards were of black, Asian or minority ethnicities. A research report by the Countryside Charity revealed the gulf between socially deprived areas and the countryside, highlighting issues such as poor public transport as barriers in access. The first time I walked in the footsteps of the Kinder Scout mass trespassers, known as the Manchester Ramblers, was after being racially abused on a TransPennine journey by a man who told me to go back to where I’m from – and so I did: I’m from the north and decided to make a journey of reclamation walking the Pennine Way. I once again walk up Kinder Scout, this time one of a group of ramblers joining the Kinder in Colour walk, an initiative commemorating the mass trespass and highlighting the issues of inequality and inaccessibility that still remain, bringing people of colour to walk together. The event organisers include Sam Siva, also an organiser with Land in Our Names, a land racial justice collective, and Nadia Shaikh who describes the event as a “coalition”, bringing together other groups campaigning for better access to the countryside including Muslim Hikers, Black Girls Hike, Land in Our Names, Right to Roam and Landscapes of Freedom. The event centres on ritual and healing. “We want to heal the land and ourselves,” say the organisers. “We want to share space so that our joy, healing and resistances are infused with the same spirituality that we feel when we connect to the land.” The history of the countryside is rooted in colonialism, class and exclusion. The walk seeks to change that. Shaikh says accessibility has been considered in the planning: the starting point for the 3km circular walk, for example, is in Edale, taking into account the fact there is a train station there. Anant, from Manchester, who is also part of the Mad Walkers and Manchester Walkers groups, believes more minority ethnic people should be encouraged to come out walking in the great outdoors. I walk with people of all ages, including a family with young children who are climbing a mountain for the first time. I speak to people from Survivor Alliance who tell me: “We love going out. We’re healing and recovering from the traumas we went through. When we are out we feel free. It’s amazing to meet people and enjoy nature”. As we walk, there is hope and defiance in the air that the dreams of the brave trespassers for access to nature for all might yet be realised.",Lifestyle/Travel,Kinder Scout 90 years on: UK’s national parks still largely white and middle class,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/24/kinder-scout-90-years-on-uks-national-parks-still-largely-white-and-middle-class
4/25/2022,"The Kop taunted Everton with chants of “Going down” while Liverpool refused to give up on catching Manchester City in the title race. Andy Robertson was the unlikely derby hero, and Divock Origi a not-so-unlikely one, with headers that broke the impressive resistance that Frank Lampard’s relegation-threatened team had staged at Anfield. Robertson timed his second goal of the season to perfection from a Liverpool perspective with nerves increasing among the home support prior to his 62nd minute breakthrough. Origi appeared from the bench to torment Everton yet again with his third league goal of the campaign as Jürgen Klopp’s team made it 12 Premier League home victories in succession. But it was far from the procession that many had anticipated. The sense of foreboding that accompanied Everton to Anfield deepened before a ball had been kicked in the 240th Merseyside derby. Burnley’s win over Wolves dropped Lampard’s team into the relegation zone for the first time this season. If that wasn’t enough, Ben Godfrey suffered a quadricep injury in the warm-up and was replaced by Michael Keane. Lampard had rested Yerry Mina completely following his return from a two-month lay-off against Leicester on Wednesday, leaving Everton a man down on a substitutes’ bench that included 18-year-old midfielder Isaac Price. To their credit, neither the disruption nor the increasing fear of relegation affected the visitors in a first half that stifled and irked Liverpool in equal measure. Lampard flooded his midfield and borrowed some of the wind-up tactics that José Mourinho employed here when Chelsea derailed Liverpool’s title bid in 2014. Jordan Pickford took an age over every goal-kick and clearance. Richarlison collapsed in a heap whenever touched, and sometimes when not touched at all, while the otherwise excellent Anthony Gordon was booked for diving over Naby Keïta’s leg inside the Liverpool penalty area. That sparked the first of two scuffles in the opening period and, in truth, the needle was more entertaining than the game itself. Liverpool’s frustration was chiefly down to Everton’s well-organised, disciplined defending and sharp counter-attacks than time-wasting and theatrics. The hosts were unable to repeat the first-half blitzes that devastated Manchester City and United in their previous two outings because there were no gaps left to exploit. Unusual sloppiness in possession did not help Liverpool’s cause either. Pickford was barely troubled before the interval. Sadio Mané’s shot over in the 21st minute was Liverpool’s first – and only – attempt of note until Robertson broke the deadlock and the rising tension inside Anfield. The bigger threat came from Everton on the break. Gordon raced away from Trent Alexander-Arnold onto an Abdoulaye Doucouré pass and went down just outside the area after a push in the back from the full-back. Referee Stuart Attwell gave nothing. Doucouré also went through following good work by Richarlison but lacked conviction all the way and dragged a tame shot across the face of Alisson’s goal. Gordon did similar in the second half, sprinting through on the left but pulling his effort wide of the far post. As mentioned, needle was the most notable feature of the first half. Richarlison went down holding his face following a touch from Fabinho early on. He fell holding his head again later in the half, forcing Attwell to halt play to the obvious annoyance of Liverpool’s players. When the Brazil international stayed down seconds later with an ankle injury both the referee and Liverpool played on. Doucouré, incensed, took matters into his own hands by hacking down Fabinho for a booking. Another melee ensued and Mané was booked for raising a hand to Allan’s face. Diogo Jota was fortunate when, having been fouled by Seamus Coleman, he reacted with a raised arm that just missed the Everton captain. Everton remained dangerous on the counterattack, almost exclusively via Gordon, who was cleaned out on one run by Alexander-Arnold and had a penalty appeal waved away after a tussle with Joël Matip. But there was more intensity and urgency to Liverpool in the second half with Mohamed Salah increasingly prominent. It was the introduction of Origi and Luis Díaz around the hour mark - that Klopp staple - that made the vital difference, however. Origi, so often the scourge of Everton, had only been on the pitch a minute when he exchanged passes with Salah inside the visitors’ penalty area. Salah chipped a delightful cross to the back post where Robertson, of all people, charged in to head beyond an exposed Pickford. Mason Holgate headed off the line from Joël Matip, with Salah slicing the rebound over, and Robertson then made an invaluable contribution at the other end of the pitch when clearing Dele Alli’s cross before Alex Iwobi could tap home. Victory was secured in the final minutes with Liverpool substitutes again to the fore. When Robertson’s corner sailed over a crowded area, Jordan Henderson collected and centred for Díaz at the back post. The Colombia international connected with a scissor-kick that bounced off the turf. Origi, that man again, ghosted in behind two Everton defenders to beat Pickford with a close range header. There was still time for Alisson to mock Pickford’s earlier time-wasting by flopping on the ball after saving from Richarlison. Liverpool had the last laugh, but had been made to fight all the way.",Sport/Football,Robertson and Origi sink Everton to keep Liverpool on title trail,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/24/liverpool-everton-premier-league-match-report
4/25/2022,"The White House Covid response coordinator Ashish Jha appeared to undercut the Biden administration’s efforts to reinstate the federal mask mandate on Sunday, stating that the spreading BA.2 variant in the US was unlikely to have much effect on the nation’s pandemic recovery. The justice department announced last week it would appeal the decision of a federal judge in Florida to prematurely lift the mandate on air, rail and bus travel in the US, based on the assertion by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that “an order requiring masking in the indoor transportation corridor remains necessary for the public health”. With cases rising again in the US, Anthony Fauci, the government’s leading infectious diseases expert, told CNN he was “disappointed” by the judge’s ruling and that “this is a CDC issue – it should not have been a court issue.” But in an interview on CNN’s State of the Union Sunday, Jha said that while he was “concerned” about the spread of Omicron variants including BA.2, he did not see it having any significant impact. “We’re going to see cases go up, we’re going to see cases go down, the key things [are] making sure that hospitalizations and deaths are not rising in any substantial way,” he said. “I’m concerned, I’m gonna watch those numbers. But at this point, I remain confident that we’re gonna get through this without disruption.” Jha did not tie his “without disruption” comment to the mask mandate, and said he shared Fauci’s belief that the mandate should be an issue for scientists, not the courts. But opponents of the mandate, and the government’s legal efforts to reinstate it, are likely to point to it as evidence the government does not appear too alarmed by the new surge in cases. Jha also addressed concerns of families that vaccinations were still not yet available to children under five, and that the mandate was lifted in apparent disregard of that fact. “I have a lot of friends with kids. And I totally understand they’re frustrated. I am frustrated on their behalf,” he said. “Neither Moderna nor Pfizer have yet submitted an application for an emergency authorization. We expect Moderna to do that this week and then the FDA (US food and drug administration) scientists are going to do what they have done throughout the whole pandemic, which is evaluate the data for safety and effectiveness.” But, he said, final approval could still be weeks away: “I have no expectations that there are going to be any major hiccups, this should move quickly … my expectation is it’s certainly going to happen in the next couple of months.” Biden’s government has been accused of causing “confusion” over its mask mandate messaging, the justice department appeal following the president’s comment that “it’s up to them” when asked if passengers should wear masks on public transportation. “When people wear a well-fitting mask or respirator over their nose and mouth in indoor travel or public transportation settings, they protect themselves, and those around them, including those who are immunocompromised or not yet vaccine-eligible,” the CDC said in its statement strongly recommending that travelers continue to wear them.",News/World news,"US can manage BA.2 variant ‘without disruption’, top Covid adviser predicts",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/biden-covid-adviser-ashish-jha-variant
4/25/2022,"Gregory Andrews was Australia’s first threatened species commissioner, appointed in 2013 by the then incoming Coalition environment minister Greg Hunt. He recently returned to the country, after serving as high commissioner to Ghana, and was disheartened by what he found. Andrews believes the state of the country’s natural wildlife and biodiversity is the “worst it’s ever been” and calls the ongoing destruction of forests and other habitat “crazy”. After a political term marked by consecutive summer disasters and multiple official reports highlighting government failure, he sees it as a major issue. But, as far as the first two weeks of the election campaign are concerned, the environment may as well not exist. “Biodiversity and nature have been completely absent from this campaign so far,” he says. “That makes me really sad because Australians define ourselves through our wildlife. We’ve got them on our money, our sports teams, our coat of arms, the tail of Qantas. We can’t keep defining ourselves by our wildlife when we’re losing it to extinction.” Given so much of Australia’s landscape had already been cleared, he believes the time has come for a conversation about sharing what remains with the country’s unique, and increasingly struggling, wildlife. “If we’re serious about what it means to be Australian … we are a rich enough country with enough habitat and enough cleared area to dedicate the remaining land to protection,” he says. “The trouble is the Greens are the only party that says that, and it is seen as a fringe or extremist position.” Andrews spent three years as threatened species commissioner. He says while he was proud of some of the things that were achieved under Hunt, he felt restricted due to climate denialism within the Coalition and the refusal to deal with habitat degradation. He is not alone in raising concerns about the environment missing from the campaign. Others are also trying to raise its profile. A new report from a coalition of conservation groups says if Australia was serious about nature protection, it would increase its spending ten-fold. It highlights 100 animals and plants – including the orange-bellied parrot and the grassland earless dragon – that are at imminent risk of extinction. The South Australian independent senator Rex Patrick this week called for a change in the way the environment is treated in the next parliament, including requiring the prime minister to make an annual extinction statement, listing the species newly declared as either extinct or critically endangered. The question is: is anyone listening? That Australia is not doing enough to protect its environment is well known. In the past term alone, three official reports, two from the Australian National Audit Office plus the independent review of Australia’s environmental laws by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel, highlighted a litany of environmental failures. A fourth, the five-yearly State of the Environment report, is also expected to highlight the ongoing decline. That report could have been tabled by the Morrison government before the campaign began but has been withheld. The rate of land-clearing in states such as Queensland and New South Wales has been increasing and the addition of new species to Australia’s national list of threatened wildlife was accelerated by the country’s worst bushfire disaster. The Australian Capital Territory’s faunal emblem, the gang-gang cockatoo, entered the list as endangered, with the expert scientific committee highlighting the climate crisis as the major driver of reductions to populations of the bird. And a week before the election was called, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change again sounded the alarm that the world was rapidly running out of time to limit warming to 1.5C. That the climate and nature crises are intertwined is acknowledged globally. But the conversation about either of these issues in the campaign so far has been characterised by commentary on power bills, based on unsourced modelling, and a $220m pledge by prime minister, Scott Morrison, for native forestry in Tasmania. Before the election was called, the Morrison government also promised $50m for a single species, the koala, which had its conservation status upgraded in February from vulnerable to endangered. Carol Booth, the principal policy analyst at the Invasive Species Council, says the silence from the major parties on what the next government will do to change the trajectory reveals a lot. “They’re obviously making a judgment that it’s not going to turn the election for them,” she says. “They pay attention to individual crises, like the fires. But because it’s a long term, insidious problem and there are so many threats coalescing and interacting … it’s hard to get your head around. “You’re not going to see results in one term of government.” The council – backed by BirdLife Australia, Bush Heritage, the Humane Society International and the Australian Land Conservation Alliance – has released a new report that notes extinctions are expected to dramatically escalate in Australia over the next two decades due to Australia’s failure to deal with the major threats of invasive species, habitat destruction and climate change. It identifies 100 species that have a high risk of extinction in that time, including 20 freshwater fish, nine birds, eight frogs, six reptiles, one mammal and one butterfly with a greater than 50% risk of extinction within 20 years, and 55 plants at high risk of extinction within 10. It argues an overhaul of Australia’s threat abatement system is necessary after years of neglect, evidenced by overdue and outdated species recovery plans and the near decade-long failure by the Coalition to formally list major threats. That streak was finally broken this week after fire regimes that cause wildlife decline was officially listed as a key threat to Australia’s environment, 14 years after it was first proposed. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, signed off on the decision shortly before the election was called. The Invasive Species Council’s report puts forward solutions, including that governments simply apply the laws and protections they have neglected for so long. That is, systematically listing major threats and developing and implementing plans to tackle them as well as recover species. And it reiterates earlier work by a group of scientists led by the conservation ecologist Brendan Wintle that found Australia needed a ten-fold increase in nature spending to recover endangered wildlife. Booth says this would require expenditure of about $1.5bn to $2bn annually. “That’s not much in terms of the whole budget but it’s a lot more than they’ve committed to date,” she says. Samantha Vine, the head of conservation and science at BirdLife Australia, says most voters care about nature, but that passion is not always visible to politicians. She says when governments do make the effort to tackle threats, the trajectory of species facing extinction can be turned around. On Macquarie Island, for example, breeding populations of grey-headed albatross on Macquarie Island are recovering after governments prioritised the eradication of rodents and rabbits on the island. “It shows what can happen if you just invest in the work that needs to be done,” she says. Guardian Australia asked the Coalition, Labor and the Greens about their priorities for nature. Much of the Morrison government’s term has focused on its environmental deregulation agenda and a bid to transfer environmental approval powers to the states and territories. But Ley says it has also “delivered more than $6bn in environmental spending since 2019” and points to budget announcements of $1bn for the Great Barrier Reef and $100m for the Environment Restoration Fund. As minister, she established a new 10-year threatened species strategy and delivered a long-awaited recovery plan for the koala. “The Morrison government is committed to practical action and to working with communities, land managers, traditional owners and scientists to protect the environment, from our heritage places to the health of our oceans and native species,” she says. Labor’s environment spokesperson, Terri Butler, says the party will have more to say about the environment closer to the election, but has already committed to increased funding for Indigenous rangers and Indigenous Protected Areas as well as $200m for urban rivers and catchments. She says the Australia State of the Environment Report, which Ley was sitting on, should be made public. “Protecting and restoring the environment has never been more important after bushfires and floods,” Butler says. “The environment cannot afford to have the Morrison-Joyce government mismanage [it] for another term.” The Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, says the party has been “fighting against the Liberal-Nationals attacks on our environment since they came to power”. “Our environment is in crisis and the Greens are crucial to protecting it in the parliament,” she says. She says the Greens have the most comprehensive policy of the parties for protecting the environment, which includes a zero extinction target and a commitment to end habitat destruction. This week Rex Patrick, who is fighting to keep his seat, said if reelected he would move for the prime minister to be “personally accountable for Australia’s irrevocable environmental failures”. Patrick wants to create a requirement in Australia’s environmental laws stating the prime minister must table an annual extinction and endangered species statement to parliament listing the species newly declared as either extinct or critically endangered. “No prime minister is going to be very keen to stand up in the parliament and sound the death knell for unique Australian species,” he said. “But that is what’s likely to be required to focus the minds of governments to take action before the irrevocable point of extinction is reached.”",News/Environment,‘Worst it’s ever been’: a threatened species alarm sounds during the election campaign – and is ignored,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/25/worst-its-ever-been-a-threatened-species-alarm-sounds-during-the-election-campaign-and-is-ignored
4/25/2022,"Traditional owners in western New South Wales are divided over a decision to rebury Mungo Man and Mungo Lady without a public memorial or keeping place. The 42,000-year-old remains, which are the oldest human remains ever found in Australia, will be reburied along with 106 others in 26 burial sites spread across Mungo national park and nearby lease areas. But a number of members of the Barkindji, Mutthi Mutthi and Ngiyampaa peoples, who have custodianship of the area, say that burying the remains in unknown locations, rather than interring them in a public keeping place, will undermine the value of the world heritage area and goes against the wishes of previous generations. Instead, they say, the remains should be housed on country in a way that celebrates and memorialises the impact they have had on Australian history, and the scientific recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the oldest continuous culture on Earth. Five traditional owners, as well as Jim Bowler, the geologist who discovered Mungo Lady and Mungo Man in 1968 and 1974 respectively, wrote to the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, on 14 April to demand that she explain her reasons for approving the reburial. As of Friday, they had not received a response. The letter, seen by Guardian Australia, says the reburial proposal has caused “immeasurable cultural harm and soul sickness”. “If they go and do this, then our future generations are losing their cultural identity,” one of the signatories, Mutthi Mutthi man Jason Kelly, tells Guardian Australia. “There has been no free, prior and informed consent from the community of this decision.” Prof Bowler also plans to write to Unesco to argue that if the reburial goes ahead as planned, the world heritage area should be considered an endangered site. Mungo Man and Mungo Lady were central to the decision to grant the area world heritage status in 2007 on the grounds of outstanding natural and cultural values, Bowler says. “Their disappearance of their confidential disposal into the ground is equivalent to the virtual closing off of the inspiration that provided the very basis for world heritage inscription,” he says. “It will have a devastating effect.” Ley approved the reburial plan late last month, and said in a statement on 6 April announcing her decision that it was taken following a public consultation period and after she visited the Willandra Lakes and discussed the issue with traditional owners. “I have found that while it is important that we are able to document history, it is equally important that we respect the cultural intent of the burial process and the heartfelt views of the descendants,” the statement said. Support for the reburial plan comes from the Willandra Lakes Region Aboriginal advisory group, a body established in 2015 to advise on the management of the world heritage area. It is made up of nine members of the three traditional owner groups. But Kelly and others say the advisory group no longer represents the view of the broader traditional owner groups. He and his father, Danny Kelly, were both members of the Aboriginal advisory group until August last year, when they were removed for breaching NSW government guidelines by speaking publicly against the proposal. Both disagree that they breached guidelines and say they adamantly support the reburial of the remains – provided that is accompanied by a firm commitment to design and build a keeping place. The chair of the advisory group, Patsy Winch, is Danny Kelly’s sister. She has declined all media interviews since the reburial decision was announced, but said in a statement issued by the NSW government that she was happy and relieved a conclusion had been reached. “Finally, after all that time has passed, the voices of the elders have been heard and I am thankful that these ancestral remains will finally be laid to rest the traditional way, in Country,” she said. The advisory group did not hold public meetings for traditional owners on the reburial proposal. The public consultation process cited by Ley received 162 submissions. According to a summary published by Heritage NSW, just 10 were from either a traditional owner or traditional owner organisation for Willandra, and five more were from First Nations organisations or individuals. One of those submissions was from Kelly. He says it was not a consultation process “that Aboriginal people are able to navigate or understand”. He also said the wording of the proposal misrepresented the plan for a keeping place – describing it as an alternative to reburial. Kelly says the wishes of elders had always been for the remains to be laid to rest and for a keeping place to be constructed – not contrary proposals, but existing side by side. He spoke against the current reburial proposal after reading the minutes of meetings with elders about what should be done to return the remains to Country, dating back to 1982. His grandmother, Alice Kelly, was a member of the original consultation group. “The elders have left us instructions,” he says. “My grandmother wanted them placed into a keeping place. She did not want them to be buried in this way … she wanted them safe and secure in a known location.” The advisory group supported the establishment of a keeping place until 2018, when it was presented with a reburial plan by staff from the NSW office of environment and heritage. “It was a 103-page document and the committee was asked to agree on the back of a 10-minute presentation,” Kelly said. A spokesperson for Ley said concerns the reburial proposal would deteriorate the cultural values of the world heritage area “misrepresents the spirit of the decision, the rights of traditional owners, and the outstanding universal value of the site under the world heritage convention”. They said the reburial would be done in a way that minimises the chances of natural decay and the locations would be recorded. Barkindji man Michael Young, who also signed the letter to Ley, says the creation of a keeping place was “always the proposal”. Eminent architects have been approached over the past 20 years to provide a design, culminating in Glenn Murcutt, who visited the Willandra Lakes in the early 2010s and agreed to take on the job as one of the final commissions of his career. Murcutt was accompanied to the region by Michael Ockwell, who was the chair of the Willandra Lakes region community management council for 20 years. That committee was disbanded in 2013 to make way for the yet to be realised Indigenous management of the park. The proposal for a keeping place was developed by that committee in consultation with elders from the traditional owner group. “The idea was that there would be a crypt or repository and it would have attached to it an education or cultural centre,” Ockwell says. The proposal had the full support of the three traditional owner groups at the time. He says the failure to act on it “was always a question of funding”. They hired a consultant to help develop a business case in an attempt to convince the NSW government. “I think it’s fair to say that as far as the NSW government was concerned it never made the case sufficiently well enough to justify government funding,” Ockwell says. Young says if the park was jointly managed by traditional owners, this would not have happened. Barkindji people were awarded native title over 80% of the national park in 2015, and have applied to be able to jointly manage the area. That application has been sitting unanswered with the NSW government for six years. “Aboriginal people need to be custodians,” he said. “We’re talking about nearly 2,000 generations here.

4/25/2022,"Checking in on Anzac Day commemorations at the Australian War Memorial today? If so, besides paying appropriate respect to our service personnel, perhaps consider just how contorted the official memorialisation of war has become in this country. This should be a day of quiet reflection. It should be one to reflect not only on the experiences of the Australians and New Zealanders who, disastrously, helped invade Gallipoli 107 years ago (to retreat before Christmas), but more broadly on war’s impact on humankind – which is what Anzac Day has evolved into. The memorial’s historic mandate – “to assist Australians to remember, interpret and understand the Australian experience of war and its enduring impact on Australian society” – is noble and important. It is not about the promotion of war or its machines of destruction. It is not about soldierly heroics. It is about bringing insight into what war does to individual humans and societies. Needless to say, most of what it does is hideous, as demonstrated by the worst conflagration since the second world war that is now playing out in Ukraine. But with the dawn of every Anzac Day in recent years, the memorial falls ever shorter of that duty. It is drifting closer to becoming some military Disneyland, with an unnecessary $500m expansion so it might display more military hardware and stage exhibitions on contemporary conflicts before their impact can be properly assessed. It is steadily evolving into a place of entertainment, rather than reflection, that boastfully celebrates combat triumph and blokey derring-do – not least in terms of its questionable hot-takes on Australia’s failed Afghan mission and continued uncritical deification of special forces at a time when those units are mired in potentially existential moral/legal quagmires. In recent years there has been a global renaissance in the way all sorts of collecting institutions tell their stories and face the often unpalatable truths about some objects in their collections and the histories behind them. This renaissance extends to an ever more prudent consideration of who sits on their management boards and, critically, their sources of sponsorship. But it often seems as if the war memorial – at once, uniquely, a war museum, a secular shrine of remembrance and archive since it opened in 1941 – is determinedly culturally retrograde when it comes to questions of historical truth-telling and fundraising. Too much of the unpalatable battlefield and home-front truths about the Australian war experience are omitted. This includes the illegal battlefield (and postwar) killings by Australian troops in conflicts since the Boer war (as chronicled by Paul Brereton into his inquiry into ADF conduct in Afghanistan). Instructively, the memorial will appropriately tell the visitor plenty about the cruelty of Japanese captors to Australian PoW. But it is silent (publicly at least, though it holds evidence in its collections) of Australian killings of surrendered Japanese prisoners and of diggers’ trophy photographs with enemy dead. There is, of course, another grievous omission from the memorial: its refusal to adequately chronicle Aboriginal resistance in the frontier conflicts with Indigenous people that were, effectively, the wars for Australia. Recently a former director (1990-1994) of the memorial, Brendon Kelson, died. He was to my mind – and in the view of many historians who worked with him at the AWM – the finest, most politically independent and true-to-mandate leader the institution has had. He fought the proposed memorial expansion devoting – as his friend, historian Michael McKernan, said in his eulogy for Kelson – “every minute of the day to this cause arguing persuasively, with clarity, and astounding energy for one who was so unwell. Brendon knew the fix was in and the fight could not be won. That was no reason to abandon it”. More than once, Kelson expressed sadness that the memorial of recent years was becoming a military “theme park”. As for the “fix” as McKernan so accurately puts it … it was well in place from April 2018, when then director Brendan Nelson (not to be confused with like-sounding, though poles apart, Kelson) announced, in a soft ABC story that was effectively PR for the institution, that the memorial would be expanded. Federal Labor has, largely uncritically, supported the project (such is the peril of challenging Anzac reverence, it seems; why, just ask Yassmin Abdel-Magied). Nelson (a former defence minister who has sent Australians into conflict) was undoubtedly the most high-profile and politically influential of directors. After finishing as director in 2019 Nelson went to work for weapons manufacturer Boeing, which – like other assorted arms makers including Thales, BAE and Lockheed Martin – has sponsored the memorial. And this is the biggest perversion, the one I referred to above, of the memorial’s values, I think – something else to contemplate when it comes to the integrity of memorialisation. Should a building sponsored by companies that make the weapons of war be host on Anzac Day to the most public and revered Australian commemoration of war dead? Nelson has come back to the memorial, this time as its newest governing council member. In the past he has assiduously defended accepting sponsorship money from arms manufacturers for the memorial. On the governing council he replaces Kerry Stokes. Late last week Nelson was formally appointed as Stokes’ replacement as AWM’s governing council chair. So, the president of arms manufacturer Boeing Australia is now effectively the head of governance at Australia’s secular shrine for war remembrance. What is wrong with this picture? Discuss … This week Guardian Australia revealed the memorial had sought a new funding deal from Lockheed Martin despite being inundated with opposition from many veterans, historians and retired memorial staff. So, on what should be a day of quiet reflection – one far removed from the politicians who send young people to die in their wars but never go themselves, far removed from the companies that obscenely profit from combat and from those who’d obscure its callous truths – it pays to think about whether the war memorial remains the appropriate place for national Anzac commemorations. I’m not alone in thinking that the money of weapons manufacturers has sullied the place as a stage for official commemoration of Australian war dead.",News/Australia news,A war memorial sponsored by weapons dealers is no place for quiet reflection on Anzac Day | Paul Daley,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2022/apr/25/an-australian-war-memorial-sponsored-by-weapons-dealers-is-no-place-for-quiet-reflection-on-anzac-day
4/25/2022,"A government proposal to build luxury cabins in the Great Sandy national park poses a threat to its pristine natural beauty and Aboriginal cultural heritage, locals say. The Queensland government plans to construct “eco-tourism” accommodation in locations along the Cooloola Great Walk, which runs from Noosa North Shore through Cooloola to Rainbow Beach. The project has left locals anxious that the accommodation will devastate parts of the 102km coastal route, which winds through massive sand hills, rainforests and wetlands. “We could call it ego-tourism,” said Greg Wood, convener of Protect Our Parks and Rainbow Beach resident. “We’re going into the last refuges of nature … that have been protected from commercial private development … and we’re going to monetise them as well.” Ten cabins are proposed to be built in a forest overlooking Poona Lake, which has “substantial ecological and recreational values,” according to a March 2021 government report. Wood said the development was “unacceptable” as it would create “disturbance in a very sensitive and unique landscape”. “This proposal is imposing the venal needs of an elite class on to nature and making it yield to their demands,” he said. Ecological experts have raised “significant concerns” about the risk to the “wetland values” of another proposed accommodation site at the Noosa River, near rare patterned ferns, according to the government report. The government has previously announced private company, CABN, as the preferred proponent to build the accommodation on a 30-year lease. “The government has lost track of the reason national parks exist,” local resident Matthew Noffke said. “It’s not about infrastructure and accommodation. It’s about preserving the last refuges of pristine environments that we have left.” As co-founder of Keep Cooloola Cool, Noffke believes there are pressing issues affecting the national park that deserve government investment. “We’ve got degradation problems on the eastern beach with 4WDs and camping misuse. This does nothing to address those problems,” he said. “It’s a slap in the face for every Queenslander. It should be an inclusive project … that incorporates everyone’s ideas.” The government said it has consulted with local traditional owners and the Kabi Kabi people on the proposal. Diane Djaki Widjung, keeper of records for the Sovereign Kabi tribe, said many Kabi Kabi people oppose development in the area and see it as “disrespectful”. “They certainly don’t want to see acres and acres of forest knocked down to put in cabins and walkways,” she says. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “[The proposal] has nothing to do with Aboriginal cultural heritage. It’s aimed at giving wealthy people a night in a comfortable cabin … where they can go for a little walk in the bush.” A spokesperson for the Queensland department of environment and science said the proposal was still under negotiation and the issuing of a lease has yet to be considered. “All walking tracks, four-wheel drive tracks, drive-in campsites and beach access within Great Sandy national park will remain open to the public,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson said the Poona Lake site was chosen after consultation with ecologists, groundwater experts and representatives of the Kabi Kabi First Nations People. “On 30 June 2021, the commonwealth government determined the project, under the EPBC Act, is not likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance and does not require further commonwealth assessment.”",News/Australia news,Queensland plan to build cabins in beachside national park angers communities,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/25/queensland-plan-to-build-cabins-in-beachside-national-park-angers-communities
4/25/2022,"Is there a funnier Australian than Shaun Micallef? If you’re an Australian millennial who convinced your parents to switch over to ABC one fateful Monday in 1998 and watch the premiere of The Micallef Program (later Programme, then Pogram), the answer is obvious. Micallef’s 90s run taught me a lot about what I find funny, and he’s continued to churn out gold ever since. This list is a mix of individual sketches, moments, ongoing bits, books, and the entire run of one television show spanning a decade. Keeping the list chaotic feels like the only appropriate way to honour Micallef’s legacy, and boiling down his Full Frontal run to one sketch simply wouldn’t be right. Warning: Milo Kerrigan, perhaps Micallef’s most iconic character, didn’t make the list. Don’t think of that as a slight against the battered boxer – I just think everything else here is funnier. 14. On the Sauce This insightful documentary series about Australian drinking culture makes the list not because it’s a laugh riot, but because it manages to be funny all the way through without ever taking its subject matter lightly or straying from its more serious objectives. As a host, Micallef is gregarious, witty, and occasionally goofy – which makes his moments of genuine emotional vulnerability hit much harder. 13. The Micallef P(r)ogram(me): Attentione il est Myron This ongoing claymation series, which would pop up during The Micallef P(r)ogram(me)’s three season run without much in the way of context or preamble, is perfectly janky and infectiously cheerful. It’s hard to say how directly involved Micallef himself was in the making of these things, but his croaky delivery of the little dude’s lines is delightful. 12. His Christopher Walken impression When it comes to impressions, less is more. Micallef’s impression of Walken singing Bowie is funny, but this single word and gesture make for a perfect result. 11. His 2010 Logies acceptance speech Making fun of the awards shows that laud you can come across as tacky or stuck-up, but the Logies, Australian television’s night of nights, have always felt cosmically irrelevant in a way that makes them difficult to take seriously, no matter how worthy the winners are. Micallef is a Logies mainstay, and when he won most popular presenter in 2010, he found a way to perfectly thread the needle between irreverence, excessive grandeur, and genuine gratitude. Even his run up to the stage is funny. 10. Preincarnate My original plan was to highlight one particular passage in Preincarnate, Micallef’s wild time-travel novella, about a messy transcription practice that I remembered greatly enjoying. But flicking back through the book trying to find a specific part made it impossible to narrow things down – it turns out that you can flick to any single page in Preincarnate and find something funny, regardless of how well you remember the plot or the characters (who include Tom Cruise and Sherlock Holmes). More novels please, Shaun. 9. His appearance on the interminable Breakfast morning show I never watched Breakfast, Channel 10’s short-lived attempt at taking on Sunrise and Today, beyond the clip above; a quick check of the “controversies” section of the show’s Wikipedia confirms that it was not worthy of any more respect than Micallef paid it when he visited. Micallef’s lively dismantling of the “Gen Y v Gen Wise” segment he was booked onto, and his utter unwillingness to engage with the question of whether or not technology is “bad”, is delightful to watch – as is host Paul Henry’s clear irritation. 8. Thank God You’re Here: children’s presenter sketch Micallef is not an improv comic, and you can see the fear in his eyes at times in this sketch. But 16 years on, I still occasionally think about “Alfred Gurns” and start laughing. 7. Full Frontal: his Billy Connolly impression Look at that impression. It’s fuckin’ brilliant. Look at it! Fuck! 6. Full Frontal: Roger Explosion sketches The secret to this wonderfully chintzy James Bond parody, which consists of nine separate Full Frontal sketches and a chapter in his book Smithereens, is that it bares almost no resemblance to James Bond. The Roger Explosion series gets very specific with its weird line readings, repeated Easter eggs, botched stage cues and increasingly convoluted mythology. Watch every sketch in a row and you essentially get a full saga, which is a wild thing for a pre-DVD sketch show to accomplish. 5. Mad as Hell Mad as Hell, a spiritual successor to Micallef’s also-great Newstopia, has been keeping us mad with good humour for 10 years now. The show is built on his energy and rapid-fire delivery (and the eponymous undercurrent of his anger), but this isn’t a show where you can point to one specific sketch or moment as a standout. Micallef’s longest running show feels like a pure force for good – but more importantly for this list, it’s also very funny. 4. Micallef P(r)ogram(me): an open letter to the prime minister This sketch is very simple, but it’s also perfect. It has the awkward, recognisable sincerity of the young girl and her cloying letter to John Howard; the winking reference to South Australian suburb Reynella; Micallef’s uncomfortable straight man. But the real genius is making a gross-out gag this funny. 3. SmithereensSmithereens has the energy of a book written by someone who thinks they might never get the chance to write another. This collection of short, irreverent essays, scripts, and stories is funny on the sentence level. The “About the Author” page is funnier than most whole comedy books. Even Smithereens is a funny word. 2. Full Frontal: David McGahan’s World Around Us: Cats There is a kind of powerful magic flowing through this Full Frontal sketch. It’s in the uproarious audience reactions; the timing of the cat that falls over behind Micallef in the opening monologue; the line “cats are brown, as this exception to the rule proves”. The world could be ending, fire raining down from the sky, and watching this clip would still make me feel good about being alive. 1. The Tilted Room sketches Micallef is often celebrated for his mellifluous voice and deadpan delivery, but he’s also a hugely talented physical comedian. Nothing exhibits his talents for pratfalls and funny body language better than the five separate tilted room sketches he did across Full Frontal and The Micallef P(r)ogram(me). The premise – a man enters a room, but the room is at a tilt and moving through it is difficult – is deceptively simple, but part of the fun is in trying to figure out the logistics of what is happening, which way is down, what is or isn’t going to fall. Micallef slides and capers through these things like he’s Harold Lloyd clutching at the giant clock, playing both his frustration and his desperate need to maintain control so deftly that the same punchlines can land again and again without ever diminishing. It’s a perfect bit.",Arts/Television & radio,"The 14 funniest, maddest things Shaun Micallef has ever done – sorted",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/25/the-14-funniest-maddest-things-shaun-micallef-has-ever-done-sorted
4/25/2022,"There are at least five different skincare serums in my bathroom cabinet at any one time. These sit next to three moisturisers, four foundations, and a tub of a dozen or so lipsticks. At least half of these beauty products are past their expiry date, and embarrassingly, none were bought with any real environmental regard. The Australian beauty industry was valued at $5.1bn in 2020. Globally, it sat at $662bn. Looking through my cabinet, that’s easy to believe. What’s harder to stomach is knowing how much of this packaging will ultimately end up in the garbage bin. It is difficult to find reliable figures on just how much waste the cosmetics industry generates, but Australia’s Department of Agriculture Water and the Environment notes “the vast majority of cosmetic waste ends up in landfill”. A product stewardship scheme, managed by take-back provider Close the Loop is expected to launch in mid-2022. But in the meantime, when it comes to managing that waste, sustainability consultant Celeste Tesoriero says “unfortunately, a lot of the onus is on us as customers … And it shouldn’t be.” Tesoriero describes the beauty industry as “super far behind the times” on sustainability and says the level of waste is “astronomical”. Before more robust programs are developed, there are a lot of simple and small changes you can make to tackle the problem at home. All makeup and skincare products come with expiration dates which kick in when the product is opened. As a general rule, mascaras last three to six months, while creams, powders and foundations last between 12 and 18 months, and lipsticks can be good for up to two years. Expiration dates are printed either on a product’s outer packaging or on the container itself. Look for an open jar symbol followed by a number and the letter ‘M’. This signifies how many months you have to use the product. If a leaping bunny symbol is nearby, that means it’s also certified cruelty free. Being aware of expiration dates allows you to only buy only as much of something as you can use within its active stage, and avoid throwing out barely used products later. “With fashion, you can still wear an old T-shirt ten years later. Whereas with beauty, things go off, so bigger is not always best,” Tesoriero says. According to Dr Deshan Sebaratnam, a dermatologist and senior lecturer at UNSW, expiration dates are less about mass consumerism and more about skin safety. “Using expired products may mean that you are using skincare products that don’t work or may have degraded to harmful compounds,” he says. “For instance, preservatives are used in most skincare products to stop germs breeding. If the preservatives lose their functionality then bugs can grow in your skincare products.” In addition to germs, expired products can also lead to allergic reactions or rashes, and at the very least, lose potency and effectiveness. If a product is still within its expiration period but you know you won’t use it, charities across the country like Every Little Bit Counts, Friends with Dignity, and New Day Box accept donations and pass products on to people in need. If you’re wanting to recoup costs, Facebook Marketplace and eBay both allow the selling of new and partially used products. Working your way through that stash of sample sachets and hotel toiletries before heading to a store is also a good way to avoid purchases. Even the most diligent of beauty minimalists wind up with expired products from time to time. And that’s OK, so long as they’re disposed of the right way. The best option is to drop off expired products at your nearest council waste centre, where specialists can dispose of products appropriately. In instances where this isn’t possible, products should be thrown into the bin for landfill. Importantly, washing unused products down the sink should be avoided. Almost all beauty and skincare products contain chemicals (either to stabilise formulas, add scent, or enhance functionality) or microbeads and microplastics. While these chemicals may be safe for use, they can cause serious harm to waterways – not to mention your household plumbing. Sustainability within the beauty industry is complicated. A single product is often made up of multiple plastics, all with different recycling requirements and packaging standards specific to ingredients. CEO of anti-waste group Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation, Brooke Donnelly, recommends looking for beauty brands with product refill options or that use minimal or environmentally-friendlier packaging. It is also possible to return empty or-almost empty products to stores like Mecca, MAC, Estee Lauder, Priceline, and David Jones, who all offer TerraCycle bins. Alternatively, empty products made of soft plastics can be disposed of in REDcycle bins. “Consumers can play a vital role in pressuring companies to do more to make their packaging sustainable,” Donnelly says. “Voting with your wallet at the cash register by choosing sustainable packaging sends a clear signal to businesses that they need to get on board and make changes to help us achieve a circular economy for packaging.” Arguably the biggest step in reducing waste is to simply buy less in the first place. Finding versatile products that tick multiple boxes in one, like a tinted sunscreen that acts as a daily moisturiser, foundation and sun protector, cuts three products down to one. “It’s about decluttering and buying products that are a bit more ethically produced,” Tesoriero says. “That may be a little more expensive initially, but because you’re buying less it all evens out anyway.” Tesoriero also warns against impulse shopping, a behaviour the beauty industry is exceptionally skilled at inspiring. “If you need to buy nail polish, just buy one instead of a three-pack.” Product design and packaging are other significant contributors to the beauty industry’s waste problem. For research director at UTS’s institute for sustainable futures, Dr Nick Florin, this means looking for “naked” products with minimal packaging, and containers made from glass or aluminium. Though pretty packaging is often part of a product’s appeal, he suggests avoiding elaborate “over design” and places the onus on the industry to change its ways too. “It’s great to see recycling solutions, but the first priority should really be looking at using less materials and designing packaging to avoid consumption and waste in the first place,” he says. “The next priority should be looking at reuse – so, refills, and take back packaging, then looking at better recycling. But ultimately, it should all feed back into design, because companies design the product at some point.” Donnelly agrees, saying, “beauty brands should be in the process of phasing out any single-use and problematic plastic packaging”. Many products, however, include two plastics listed as “on notice” in APCO’s 2025 action plan for problematic and unnecessary single-use plastic packaging – plastic hand pumps used on soap bottles and lotion products, and small caps and closures used on smaller products like moisturiser tubes and lip balm, which Donnelly says pose a number of issues when it comes to recycling due to their size, and the internal components of pumps, respectively. “Eliminating these … will help to ensure valuable materials aren’t lost to landfill and can go on to be used in other products,” she says. She notes that simple swaps like using bars of soap over liquid hand and body washes can also make a big difference. Much like designated organic sections in supermarkets, Tesoriero says consumers should use their voices to normalise the presence of ethical and sustainable beauty options long term. “One thing that I’ve started doing a lot of is walking up to the counter and asking where the ethical and sustainable products are, which is sort of creating that demand for the staff.” Looking into a bathroom cabinet can seem daunting. But taking accountability for its waste – and encouraging the brands responsible to change their ways – doesn’t have to be. Tesoriero points to the shift in fashion consumption. For years, that industry has faced criticism for its sustainability issues, which Tesoriero says “isn’t without reason”. If we’re willing to change our relationship with clothing for the good of the planet, she believes it is possible to do the same with our toiletries.",Lifestyle/Fashion,How to cut down cosmetic waste: ‘beauty products go off so bigger is not always best’,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/25/how-to-cut-down-cosmetic-waste-beauty-products-go-off-so-bigger-is-not-always-best
4/25/2022,"In less than two weeks, all UK voters have the chance to take part in local elections. Much political comment has inevitably concentrated on the impact that the results will have on Boris Johnson’s leadership of the Conservative party. Yet the most profound consequences of the 5 May voting could in fact be felt somewhere else altogether – in Northern Ireland. All 90 members of the Northern Ireland assembly will be elected at the end of next week by proportional representation in 18 five-member constituencies. Yet the new members of the legislative assembly may not have anything to do. Northern Ireland’s power-sharing institutions have merely been ticking over since the Democratic Unionist party first minister Paul Givan resigned in February in protest against the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit withdrawal agreement. Now they may be switched off altogether. Mr Givan’s resignation was an electioneering gesture. But it was also a sign of the electoral failure that the DUP has inflicted on itself over the past year through its internal rows. The signs are that not much has changed. The current poll average has Sinn Féin on 24% against the DUP’s 19% (both are down from 2017), with the non-sectarian Alliance on 16% and the Ulster Unionists on 14%. When the real votes are counted – with second preference transfers playing an important part – Sinn Féin may emerge as the largest single party. This would give it the right to nominate the new first minister. The election of a Sinn Féin first minister would be a historic moment. Northern Ireland was specifically created amid the turmoil of 1921 to prevent rule from Dublin. It has been governed by unionists for more than a century. The symbolic prize for republicanism would be big, and the symbolic loss for unionism at least as great. And symbols matter. In practice, though, the change may be less great than it appears. Power-sharing has already existed, on and off, for the past 24 years. The first minister has no powers that the deputy first minister does not share. A victory based on 24% support is hardly a mandate to govern unilaterally, nor to demand an early referendum on Irish reunification. After 5 May, the two largest parties must govern together, as in the past, or not at all. This may prove to be wishful thinking. If the DUP finishes second it must decide whether to nominate a deputy first minister. If it does, the institutions can resume work. If it does not, they can’t. Technically, the DUP would have until November to decide, but the loss of status may be hard to overcome. The pressures on the streets may be hard to resist, even if the DUP wanted to. The prospects are not encouraging. A return to direct rule from London is looming. This is the situation, perhaps no more than a dozen days off now, into which Mr Johnson’s government is apparently proposing to lob an explosive proposal to shred the Northern Ireland protocol that it signed in October 2019. This would be an outrageous move. It would defy the Northern Ireland electorate and decent opinion at home and abroad. It would flout the international law that Britain invokes in Ukraine. It would far exceed the UK’s own authority. Britain’s weakened prime minister seems to be blundering enthusiastically into creating the most serious crisis in Northern Ireland in a generation. It is essential that he is prevented from doing so.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Northern Ireland election: an avoidable crisis | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-northern-ireland-election-an-avoidable-crisis
4/25/2022,"Like many surfing-themed films and shows, ABC TV’s eight-part, 70s-set series Barons is drawn to the water as if by magnet, the drama interrupted by countless sunkissed montages that have a ruminative quality, as if the show is catching its breath. Time seems to stand still in these moments, which juxtapose board-riding humans against vast blue water and shimmering skies, delivering nice vibes and a particular benefit for production design: there’s no need for era-specific costumes or decor on the waves. Created by Michael Lawrence, John Molloy and Liz Doran, the series follows a bunch of entrepreneurial surfers whose stories loosely parallel the formation of Australian surfing brands such as Rip Curl and Quiksilver. Snapper (Ben O’Toole) and Trotter (Sean Keenan) are pals who work together making wetsuits, but fall out and become bitter rivals. In the first episode Trotter articulates a light bulb idea to his fiance, Tracy (Nee Chan): ordinary shorts are no good to surf in, so his plan is to make some that are. This would not just address a practical need, he says, but help sell an idea “of paradise, of summers that never end”. A long history of the beach being used as glistening scaffolding for music videos and soft drink and shampoo commercials has turned Mother Nature’s majestically designed coastal scenery into a bit of a visual cliche. Director Bruce Brown accompanied an extensive voiceover track with tonnes of beach footage in his 1966 cult classic The Endless Summer, but it’s harder to get away with such intense focus on sand and surf these days, given even the most handsomely shot surfing films – including the recent Australian documentary Facing Monsters – can feel exhaustingly pretty. The writers of Barons (Liz Doran, Matt Cameron and Marieke Hardy) seem aware that the feuding entrepreneurs is the most interesting aspect of the drama, but the show drifts away from personal stakes and business machinations towards vague impressions of hippy life way back yonder – capturing a holy trifecta of drinking, drug taking and bonking. The Vietnam war lingers in the background, unseen but registering some impact on the characters’ lives, particularly when young Aboriginal man and surfboard shaper Reg (Hunter Page-Lochard) is conscripted to serve via The Birthday Ballot. At the pub, after the ballot results are broadcast, Reg’s best friend, Dani (Sophia Forrest), announces a quintessentially “Strayan” way of managing the situation: “Let’s get royally pissed!,” she exclaims to a receptive audience. Soon Snapper climbs on top of a table, grabs two wires and electrocutes himself. This moment is intended to illustrate the character’s impetuousness, but reflects the show’s tendency for awkward moments stuck between comedy and something more serious – that are neither dramatic nor funny ha-ha. Barons was directed with a soft, warm glow that conveys a sense of rounding potentially pointy edges. These low-key vibes are fine when the characters are hanging out, doing the hippy stoner surfer thing, but become an issue when the show aspires for high-impact drama – a plotline involving a character being sent to juvenile prison, for instance, feeling tonally out of place and under-developed. The performances are decent, albeit pared back, none of the actors managing – in the first four episodes at least (which form the extent of this review) – to convey a sense of escalation. If anything Barons loses steam as the rolling time progresses. Although the principal characters are adults, the series has the twang of a coming-of-age narrative, reflecting a broader tendency to use the Australian beach as a background for stories about formative experiences – think 1976’s Storm Boy, 1977’s Summer City, 1981’s Puberty Blues, 2015’s Drown and 2018’s Breath. The latter — directed by Simon Baker and adapted from a Tim Winton novel — is a highlight of the genre, scaling back the shiny Coke-commercial look using colour grading that has misty and melancholic qualities, full of grays and whites, as if emulating seafoam or distant memories. In Barons, the frame periodically contracts to a boxed-in ratio and displays a grainy Instagram filter-like effect, mimicking the aesthetic of old 8mm films: a cruder way to evoke the past. At its best the show presents a pleasant, intermittently interesting context to return to, but it feels hazy and muted – like a faded tattoo from a distant summer, lacking colour and detail.
