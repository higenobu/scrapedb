5/12/2022,"Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) poked a sore spot of Donald Trump’s on Wednesday after the former president attacked him and two sitting GOP governors as “RINOs” for supporting Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R). “Insightful commentary about three Republican Governors who were overwhelmingly re-elected by their people from a former president who lost to Joe Biden,” Christie tweeted. “Maybe the “R” in RINO really stands for re-elected.” Insightful commentary about three Republican Governors who were overwhelmingly re-elected by their people from a former President who lost to Joe Biden. Maybe the “R” in RINO really stands for re-elected. Proud to stand with @DougDucey@GovRicketts supporting @BrianKempGA — Governor Christie (@GovChristie) May 11, 2022 RINO, one of Trump’s favorite insults for conservatives who don’t support him, stands for “Republican in name only.” Trump used the term in a statement Wednesday attacking Christie as well as Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts for their allegiance to Kemp in his reelection campaign. Trump has had a vendetta against Kemp since the governor’s decision to certify Georgia’s 2020 election results, hindering Trump’s relentless efforts to flip the presidential vote count to his favor under false pretenses of fraud at the polls. Trump’s latest statement accused Kemp of being the “worst election integrity governor in the country.” Christie, Ducey and Ricketts are campaigning for Kemp in his primary challenge against former Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), whom Trump has endorsed. Perdue has peddled Trump’s lies that the election he lost to Biden was “rigged and stolen.” Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 and appears likely to do so again in 2024, was a longtime ally of Trump’s. He has been deeply critical of the former president over his role in inciting the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.

5/12/2022,"A Tibetan herder once dubbed ""China's most handsome man"" is suing online critics for defamatory comments suggesting that his looks are his only quality.

Dingzhen Zhenzhu, 21, released a lawyer’s letter through his agent on Sunday, warning online commentators against posting defamatory comments that include “insulting, terrifying, vulgar, or vilifying words, pictures and audio.”

In November 2020, a seven-second clip of Dingzhen smiling went viral on Chinese social media, leading him to quickly rise to fame. Dingzhen was hired as an ambassador for his hometown in Litang of Sichuan Province in southwestern China – known as one of the most poverty-stricken counties in the country – and turned it into a popular tourist destination. He was invited to several events including the United Nations Development Programme’s World Earth Day last year.

 

Many people online, however, began ridiculing the 21-year-old as being talentless. They also criticized Dingzhen’s fans for purportedly placing a higher value on appearances than achievements. The online attacks escalated after a video of Dingzhen vaping was posted to social media in January 2021.

“10 years of hard academic study is not a quarter as good as Dingzhen’s smile,” one user sarcastically wrote.

A survey conducted by leading sports forum Hupu in December 2020 showed that 63% of the respondents believed they were more attractive than Dingzhen.

Dingzhen has already begun to pursue legal action against those who have posted defamatory comments and threatened to sue any others who suggest that he is nothing more than “a handsome face.”

“Never dare do anything evil no matter how trivial you think it is,” Dingzhen is quoted as saying in the lawyer's letter.
