2/28/2022,"Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, has effectively contradicted foreign secretary Liz Truss’s assertion that Britons should be able to join the fight in Ukraine, saying this was primarily for Ukrainian nationals and that people without military experience should stay away. While not directly criticising the comments on Sunday by the foreign secretary, Wallace made it plain the government did not believe ordinary Britons should try to travel to Ukraine to help fight against Russian invaders. Truss told BBC One’s Sunday Morning programme that she would “absolutely” back anyone wanting to volunteer to help the Ukrainians fighting for their freedom. She said: “That is something people can make their own decisions about. The people of Ukraine are fighting for freedom and democracy, not just for Ukraine, but for the whole of Europe. Absolutely, if people want to support that struggle, I would support them in doing that.” This appeared to run counter to advice on her department’s own website, which says those who travel to eastern Ukraine to “fight, or assist others engaged in the conflict” could be prosecuted on their return to the UK. Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme about Truss’s comments, Wallace sought to argue that the foreign secretary had been primarily trying to talk about Ukrainian nationals in the UK. He said: “I think what Liz Truss was quite rightly saying was that in her view this is a just cause, and that’s why the international community is united.” Asked if Britons should consider travelling to Ukraine, Wallace said there were better options. He said: “There are lots of ways for people to go and help. On the Ukrainian embassy website you can donate financially.” Truss’s comments prompted criticism from several MPs, including Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative backbencher who chairs the Commons defence committee. On Sunday, he tweeted: “Please do NOT go if you have no combat experience. You may get yourself and others who have to look after you, killed.” Questioned about Ellwood’s view, Wallace effectively endorsed it, while trying to not directly criticise Truss. “I don’t think Liz Truss said we are supporting non-trained people to go and fight,” he said. “The advice here is, if you want to help Ukraine there are lots of ways of doing it. If you are a Ukrainian national here, or a dual national who wants to go and join your fellow countrymen, there is no bar on you doing that. “Tobias is right in this sense, as is any professional: if you’re going to be a fighter there, first of all please try and comply with the Foreign Office advice, because it is dangerous. But secondly, be trained, have experience, don’t be serving personnel. “But fundamentally it is a dangerous situation, so if you are going to fight, be a professional, having had service.”",News/Politics, Ben Wallace distances himself from Truss comments on UK volunteers for Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/28/ben-wallace-distances-himself-from-truss-comments-on-uk-volunteers-for-ukraine
2/28/2022,"Amy Liptrot’s first book, The Outrun, chronicled her retreat from London and alcoholism to the islands around Orkney, where she had grown up on a cliffside farm. The book became a prizewinning bestseller, and her new essayistic memoir, The Instant, picks up where it left off, finding Liptrot in her mid-30s, sober, strong and single. It’s acute lonesomeness that drives her back to the mainland and from there to Berlin. She’s seeking the juvenescence that she’s started to sense is slipping through her fingers, looking for excuses to shed layers and put on party dresses again. What she really wants is a boyfriend. “I was embarrassed by my conventional desires,” she admits. “I had hoped I was more resourceful and interesting than to want a boyfriend.” Much of what she will learn in Berlin will be familiar to anyone who, similarly untethered, has embraced the nomadic ways of the “lifestyle migrant”. For instance, don’t eat pomegranate in bed in a sublet apartment. It’s a privileged if penurious existence and, for the most part, Liptrot remains in an English-speaking bubble. Even so, she makes something distinctive of this chronically hip city. Her Berlin smells of sausages and pollen. It’s scored by invisible networks of dog pee. Listen and you’ll hear the songs of cuckoos and nightingales, though good luck spotting one of its raccoon population, a beast whose feral adaptability makes it an elusive talisman for Liptrot. Meanwhile, she diligently searches for love, setting off on first date after first date. It’s a quest that can be surprisingly hard to write about – or at least write about well. It’s rarely heroic and inevitably entails flesh wounds to the pride if not spears to the heart, resulting in moping and tears. And because all a person ultimately has to offer is themselves, self-absorption is hard to dodge. (Liptrot doesn’t even try, instead borrowing from Andy Warhol’s diaries and referring to everyone else in the narrative by the initial “B”.) Inevitably, there’s a lot of waiting too. In addition to birdwatching and raccoon-stalking, Liptrot fills the longueurs with musings on the role of technology in our lives. While it’s a given that dating apps have gamified human relationships – that we binge on social media “likes” in lieu of more nourishing connections and are perpetually distracted – she does bring a certain wistful poetry to the pitfalls of “the endless scroll”. (Appealingly, she also happens to have an app on her phone that allows the moon to text her when it’s full.) At last, along comes a man with whom she feels the vibration of yearned-for promise – “a flash in the eyes, a dark deep”. Is it love? That would be telling. “I have a tendency to see the story rather than the reality,” she confesses at one point, but who among us doesn’t when it comes to romance? Crucially, if that instinct leads her astray, it will also rescue her. While it lacks the stark transcendence of The Outrun, The Instant does evocatively capture – and indeed honour – much that we try to shrug off when it comes to the often calamitous pursuit of lasting intimacy: the self-pity, the obsessive (and, yes, addictive) cyberstalking, the airport crying jags. Sometimes it’s enough for a book to simply remind you that you’re not alone.  The Instant by Amy Liptrot is published by Canongate (£14.99).

2/28/2022,"“Igrew up in a Buddhist family,” Thao Nguyen Phan says of her childhood in Vietnam. “Even though the religion here seems to emphasise peace and mindfulness, the land is turbulent, there is always conflict, and the environmental impact on the river has been very dramatic.” The Mekong, a vast river that extends from the Tibetan plateau through to the delta in Vietnam, about an hour’s drive from Ho Chi Minh City where Phan was born and lives today, is the source of the artist’s exhibition at Tate St Ives. A collection of dream-like films, paintings and installations, it serves as a ballad …for a wounded waterway. As a child in the 1990s, Phan listened to folk songs that glorified the transformation of the Mekong “from a jungle with crocodiles and wildlife” to “a rich place for human habitation and rice cultivation”. But the disastrous effects of industrialisation over the past decade led her “to question these stereotypical views of the river”. After graduating from art school in Chicago in 2014, Phan became a protege of the revered American video and performance artist Joan Jonas, and has been exhibiting internationally since. In response to the unfolding ecological crisis, Phan has created her own melancholy folklore. Her films issue stark warnings about the dangers of exploiting the natural world for personal gain. There are tales of children killed by burst hydro-dams, footage of heavy rainfall and plastic waste, and an ominous retelling of a Khmer folk story about a spoilt emperor’s daughter who tires of gold and demands a necklace made from morning dew. As punishment, the girl dissolves into the river. Phan explains her technique of blending factual, fictional and folkloric sources as a reaction to the unreliability of state-approved narratives: “In Vietnam, because we are a socialist country, there is a tendency to rewrite what happened.” Her film Mute Grain focuses on the 1945 famine. Under Japanese occupation, farmers were forced to replace edible crops with jute to make military equipment, contributing to the starvation of millions. Mute Grain combines the testimonies of famine survivors, a fictional tale of two siblings, March and August, and watercolour animations of healthy children transposed on to documentary photographs of the malnourished and dead. Nguyen has also created her own memorial: an installation of hanging jute stalks that chime as you walk among them. The work, she says, “is a lullaby, like a folk song that you sing for children to put them to sleep peacefully”. Despite the abundance of sorrow, Phan hopes that “the audience can see the beauty and optimism amid these seemingly tragic stories”. That optimism stems from the power of storytelling to commune with the ghosts of the past, and imagine alternative futures: “For me, the spirit of cinema is sometimes haunting, and sometimes has the ability to transform, reincarnate into the next life.” The siblings in Mute Grain are also the subjects of ethereal silk paintings that depict a world free from famine or ecological ruin. Here, the children are alive and well, riding mopeds, picking plentiful rice crops and dancing among the flowers. The Flower, 2016“These light sculptures are found objects: they originally decorated the streets of Vietnam during Tet, the lunar new year celebrations. The sunflower and bird shapes recall traditional Vietnamese symbols of harmony, prosperity and longevity. They also reference the symbols used in state propaganda, such as the sunflower.” Dream of March and August, 2018–ongoing“This series of paintings depicts the parallel worlds of March and August [characters in the film Mute Grain, about the 1945 famine]. March and August are siblings – however, August died during the famine and became a hungry ghost. While March looks in vain for memories of his sister, they somehow meet here in a dream-like world.” First Rain, Brise Soleil, 2021“[The film] seeks to reveal the historical and current violence and the destruction that occurs in the Mekong region; it proposes a gentler kind of modernity that shows respect to the poetry and lyricism of indigenous knowledge and our ecosystem.” No Jute Cloth for the Bones, 2019“For me, the unwrapped jute stalks become bare bones – without skin, without flesh, without coverage or protection. As the suspended jute moves and sways, it clatters and rustles. The sound is a lullaby dedicated to lives lost and the separation between the living and the dead, who are unable to reconcile due to the tragedies of war and famine.” Thao Nguyen Phan’s exhibition is at Tate St Ives, Cornwall, to 2 May.",Arts/Art and design,Thao Nguyen Phan: ‘There’s beauty and optimism in these tragic stories’,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/28/thao-nguyen-phan-theres-beauty-and-optimism-in-these-tragic-stories
2/28/2022,"Australia’s Future Fund will wind down its $200m of holdings in Russian companies, joining a wave of divestments as the country is hit with expanding international sanctions for its invasion of Ukraine. The New South Wales government also says it intends to sell its holdings of Russian assets in its investment funds, while Australian superannuation funds are taking steps to reduce their exposure. The Russian rouble crashed more than 40% after trading began on Monday after unprecedented international sanctions against the country’s financial system, although it later recovered some ground. Restrictions have limited how much the Russian central bank can do to prop up the currency, and some Russian banks are now barred from the Swift international payments system. Australia’s Future Fund said on Monday it had implemented all sanctions imposed by Australia, the US and the EU to date. “We will be winding down the remaining exposure (which is not currently subject to divestment sanctions) as market conditions permit,” a spokesperson said on Monday. The comments come after the Norwegian government announced that it’s $1.3tn (A$1.8tn) sovereign wealth fund – the world’s largest such fund – would divest its Russian assets. Australia’s Future Fund had no holdings in Russian sovereign debt or other fixed income, the spokesperson said. “We have devoted significant resources to compliance and will continue to do so as additional sanctions are announced,” they said. The NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, said it was important “for liberal democracies to stand with Ukraine and stand up for our values”, as he announced his state’s divestment plans. The $15bn NSW Generations Fund holds $75m in Russian debt and equities, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, which first reported Kean’s plans. “I informed the treasury secretary of this intention on Friday afternoon and he is currently preparing advice on how to make this happen,” Kean said in a statement on Monday. Australian superannuation funds have also been examining their exposure. Aware Super said it “took immediate steps to sell down our direct exposure to Russian assets in our portfolio last week”. “We had identified an extremely small direct exposure to Russian assets of around 0.03% of our funds under management,” they said on Monday. “We have no direct exposure to Ukraine. We’re also issuing instructions to all the asset managers we work with to ensure no new investments in Russia come into our portfolio.” UniSuper said it had no direct exposure to Russia or Ukraine but was “exposed to the impacts of higher energy prices”. “It’s pretty clear that the invasion has contributed to a perfect storm [of higher inflation and interest rates] that had already engulfed markets,” UniSuper’s chief investment officer, John Pearce, said. Rio Tinto – the majority owner of one of Australia’s largest alumina refineries – warned last week of a potential “disruption to primarily the aluminium industry” as sanctions on Russia continued to expand. Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL), which operates a refinery in Gladstone, is 20% owned by the Russian aluminium giant Rusal, which has previously been hit by US sanctions in 2018. Rio Tinto, which owns the other 80% of QAL, did not provide further comment on the situation on Monday. Instead it pointed to last week’s statement that it was closely monitoring the situation and was “confident that we have appropriate structures in place to ensure QAL’s operations will not be disrupted”. The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, did not say whether Rusal would have to divest its share of QAL. “I’m not going to comment on individual investments and details like that,” she told reporters on Monday when asked about Rusal. “They will all be worked through according to the provisions that are determined in the sanctions process and with the financial institutions involved and businesses involved.” A raft of sanctions imposed by the Australian government came into effect at midnight on Sunday, including financial sanctions and travel bans on Putin and four remaining permanent members of Russia’s security council, including the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. Payne said the government wanted to “remove any possibility of safe havens for people who have been either providing advice to or engaged in the decision-making of president Putin in his unlawful and wholesale breach of international law in his invasion of Ukraine”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor has backed the Australian government’s actions. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said there must be “a response to this vile and unprovoked act of aggression”. “We should be supporting the Ukrainian people financially, we should be supporting them with weapons, we should be tightening the screws on the Russian economy and on Vladimir Putin himself and his cronies,” Chalmers told the Nine Network. Russian state TV hosts urged viewers to “endure” and “overcome” the tough times. “We’ll rebuild our own economy from scratch, an independent banking system, manufacturing and industry,” said Vladimir Solovyov, a Russian TV host who was sanctioned last week. “We’ll rely on ourselves.” Additional reporting by Peter Hannam and Caitlin Cassidy.",News/Australia news,Australia’s Future Fund to divest $200m of holdings in Russian companies,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/28/australias-future-fund-to-divest-200m-holdings-in-russian-companies
