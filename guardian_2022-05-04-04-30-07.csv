5/4/2022,"Boris Johnson has said he has not been contacted by police about a leaving party held for his former spin doctor Lee Cain in November 2020. The prime minister said he had not yet received a questionnaire in relation to his alleged attendance at the party for Cain, his former director of communications, even though other people present are reported to have got them. Johnson is said to have given a speech and poured drinks at the event on 13 November, despite it being at the time of a stay-at-home lockdown. Asked by Times Radio whether he had received a Metropolitan police questionnaire about the party, Johnson said: “I am not commenting on this stuff generally, but the answer to that is no, not so far, or certainly not to my knowledge. “All of this will become clear with the end of the investigation.” He added: “I have been very clear with people. I don’t want to give a running commentary on the thing, so let’s wait until it is all concluded and then I will have plenty more to say.” The prime minister also said he wanted to “focus on the stuff” for which he was elected. Earlier he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that he had “no idea” whether he would be given any more fines for parties in Downing Street under Operation Hillman. He has already been fined – along with his wife, Carrie Johnson, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak – over a gathering held in the Cabinet Office for his birthday. However, he does not appear to have been fined over a “bring your own booze” party in the Downing Street garden in May 2020. In January, Johnson admitted attending the event – held during the first national lockdown, when indoor and outdoor social mixing were banned – for about 25 minutes but claimed he “believed implicitly that this was a work event”. Johnson’s principal private secretary at the time, Martin Reynolds, is said to have invited up to 100 people to the “socially distanced” evening drinks. At least one fixed-penalty notice was issued last month to a Downing Street official who attended the May garden event.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson says police have not contacted him about Lee Cain party,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/03/boris-johnson-says-police-have-not-contacted-him-lee-cain-leaving-party
5/4/2022,"A Greek court’s decision to exonerate four police officers involved in the brutal death of an LGBTQ+ activist in Athens has alarmed human rights groups, which deplored the verdict as profoundly unjust. Two men were found guilty on Tuesday of participating in the killing of Zak Kostopoulos, but the four police officers, also accused of causing fatal bodily harm, were allowed to walk free. Reacting to the verdict, Amnesty International’s Greek branch director, Glykeria Arapi, said: “Today’s decision is yet another example in Greece where victims of unnecessary use of force and their families are left without justice.” Nearly four years after Kostopoulos was beaten to death in broad daylight, the activist had become a symbol of the fight for freedom and equality, the group said. “Zak Kostopoulos will not be forgotten … we take the ruthlessness of his senseless death and the injustice of today’s decision personally. In response we will redouble our efforts to make Zak’s vision – a world free from prejudice, stigma and racism – a reality.” Anny Paparousou, a lawyer representing Kostopoulos’s family, said the ruling reflected a longstanding culture of police impunity in Greece. From the outset the case had not only exposed endemic homophobia in Greek society, but a culture of widespread abuse in the nation’s police force. “It follows in the tradition of police violence never being punished even by our courts,” she said. “While we welcome the guilty judgments we are disappointed and opposed to the four officers being set free when we have documented evidence of their participation in the crime.” Kostopoulos, a drag artist, columnist and prominent queer campaigner, was killed after appearing to seek refuge from unknown assailants in a jewellery shop in central Athens in September 2021. His discovery inside the store caused pandemonium: the shop’s owner and an estate agent with offices on the same street brutally set upon him. Footage from security cameras and phones showed police violently attempting to arrest Kostopoulos as he lay dying on the ground; witnesses described the scene as being tantamount to a lynching. The 33-year-old died from his injuries before emergency workers could take him to hospital. All six defendants were accused of inflicting fatal bodily harm. The jewellery shop owner, Spyros Dimopoulos, and estate agent, Thanassis Hortarias, were given 10-year custodial terms after the court voted, five to two, to uphold the charge – although on grounds of age, Dimopoulos, 77, will be allowed to serve the sentence at home. Although three of the tribunal’s members, including its presiding judge, recommended that the police officers be convicted of dangerous bodily harm, the men were acquitted by a majority of four to three. Kostopoulos’s family had pressed for murder charges to be brought. Amnesty had described the activist’s death as “murder”. Paparousou did not rule out appealing against the decision before Greece’s supreme court. Late on Tuesday, thousands of supporters took to the streets demanding justice for Kostopoulos.",News/World news,Greek court acquits four police officers over death of LGBT activist,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/greek-court-acquits-four-police-officers-over-death-of-lgbtq-activist
5/4/2022,"Attorneys for Johnny Depp rested on Tuesday after 13 days of testimony in the actor’s $50m defamation case against his ex-wife Amber Heard. In court in Virginia, Heard’s attorneys demanded the judge dismiss the action. Without jurors present, lawyer Ben Rottenborn asked the judge, Penney Azcarate, “to strike the plaintiff’s evidence and award summary judgment in whole or in part to Ms Heard”. Rottenborn argued that Depp abused Amber in “non-physical” ways, pointing to alleged evidence of emotional, mental and psychological abuse presented in recordings and “menacing statements”, outside disputed incidents of a physical nature. The petition to dismiss was largely procedural. After hearing counter-arguments from Depp’s counsel, Azcarate ruled the trial would proceed. Depp alleges that a 2018 op-ed Heard wrote with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which is not a defendant in the case, defamed him and caused him to lose work. The jury heard from more than two dozen witnesses called by Depp’s attorneys including three days of testimony by Depp himself. Many, including several security guards, testified about explosive verbal fights between Depp and Heard. Depp claims Heard resorted to violence and that he never physically abused her. Erin Falati, Heard’s nurse, appeared via pre-recorded video, telling the court Heard said she had issues with cocaine and alcohol and struggled with jealousy, anxiety and codependency in relationships including that with Depp. “I recall a general sense of discord in the relationship … disagreements, reconciliation and kind of that repeating pattern,” Falati said. Heard’s coping skills, the court was told, involved “compulsive anger and yelling”. A note from Falati displayed in court showed an instance when she saw Heard bleeding from her lip, allegedly after an altercation with Depp. Depp’s final witness, the forensic accountant Mike Spindler, estimated that Depp lost $40m in earnings as a result of Heard’s Washington Post article in which she described herself as a survivor of domestic abuse. Depp’s highest-earning years came in 2010 and 2011, when he earned about $70m a year. By 2016, Depp was earning $20m. He earned $45m a year later, followed by $20m in 2019 and 2020. Depp’s attorneys claim Heard’s article not only deprived him of new movie roles, including the sixth installment of Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, but affected his profit participation in films already made. The trial is in its fourth week. Heard’s lawyers said in opening statements that she was physically and sexually abused by her then husband on multiple occasions. Heard is expected to take the stand after jurors hear from a clinical and forensic psychologist, Dr Dawn Hughes. Hughes’s testimony is expected to contest claims made by a Depp witness, Dr Shannon Curry, who told the court that in her analysis of Heard, relying on previous medical notes and her interpretation of a personality survey involving 567 true-false questions and a single examination, the actor has borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder. The court has heard tapes of Depp accusing his former wife of borderline personality disorder during verbal disputes. Dr Curry said people with the disorder could resort to “very extreme behaviors” as they attempted to prevent abandonment by partners. Heard’s mental health expert, Hughes, has reportedly made her own evaluation of Heard that is expected to contradict Curry’s opinion on the actor’s mental health. Hughes has testified as an expert in abusive relationships in the trials of the Nxivm cult founder, Keith Raniere, and the singer R Kelly. Both were convicted. Heard’s defence comes days after the 36-year-old actor fired her media and PR outreach team. An online petition calling for her removal from the upcoming film Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has attracted more than 3m signatures.

5/4/2022,"Civil servants described the government’s Covid testing programme as “unlegit” and “no way to do business” in emails revealed in a high court challenge to the awarding of up to £85m in contracts for antibody tests. The campaigning organisation Good Law Project (GLP) is challenging the health and social care secretary, claiming the contracts with Abingdon Health, a medium-sized UK firm, were unlawful because they were not advertised nor open to competition, and the correct procurement process was bypassed. The antibody tests developed by Abingdon later failed to pass regulatory tests and the vast majority expired without being used. At the beginning of the hearing in central London, the GLP released details of emails obtained as a result of its legal challenge, including one in which David Williams, then the second permanent secretary at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), expressed concern at “how unlegit the entire testing strand is”. In another email, concerned specifically with Abingdon, Steve Oldfield, the chief commercial officer at the DHSC, asked Williams to “have a quiet word with [Lord] Bethell and explain to him that we could make this all a lot more legit if we just took two days to do a public call-to-arms to ‘flush out’ any other companies who might be able to play a role in this space, and remove the criticism that we haven’t given everyone a fair chance”. Bethell, then a health minister, is said by the GLP to have “made a number of interventions to assist [Abingdon]”, including championing the company – unlawfully, according to the GLP – on the basis of it being British. Bethell’s WhatsApp messages relating to government business have been unavailable for disclosure in the case because they were deleted when he replaced his mobile phone. The GLP said there were concerns highlighted over the way contracts were being awarded in relation to Abingdon but also more generally, with one email by a civil servant stating: “[This is] no way to do business but we are in exceptional times.” Additionally, the documents show an unnamed external consultant for the health and social care secretary saying of the arrangements with Abingdon: “Beyond the individual risks by themselves is there a point of mentioning that in conjunction with each other it becomes a monster of a story: first, we selected the RTC [rapid test consortium, which included Abingdon] without competition, then we might have a biased validation leading to a favoured product, we help them financially by funding upfront purchases without sufficient due diligence (ie, no contract in place) and with that commit to buying the test kits without anchoring any pricing principles. That’s big.” After Public Health England found the tests were not accurate enough for mass antibody testing they were still accepted by the DHSC, with the government saying they were suitable for use in surveillance studies, although emails also showed concerns were raised about Abingdon going bust and “extensive reputational/political damage”. Concern was subsequently expressed that it “will look like we’ve bought a load of worthless devices”. A DHSC spokesperson said: “Our engagement with Abingdon Health was led by officials – not ministers or MPs.” The case is expected to last three days.",News/World news,"Civil servants called UK Covid testing scheme ‘unlegit’, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/civil-servants-called-uk-covid-testing-scheme-unlegit-court-hears-abingdon-health
5/4/2022,"Parents and students at one of England’s top academy schools, where the children of Michael Gove and former Commons Speaker John Bercow are pupils, are locked in a bitter dispute with ministers about plans for the school to be taken over by one of the country’s largest academy chains. About 200 students at Holland Park school, west London, once known as the “socialist Eton”, are reported by a local council officer to have been involved in a “riot” inside the building two weeks ago in protest at plans for it to join the United Learning Trust, an academy chain that includes more than 80 private and state schools. A group of parents has called on the Department for Education to jettison the proposal. Lawyers for the parents have sent a pre-action judicial review letter to governors, alleging a flawed consultation and improperly constituted governing body, and the campaign group has asked for a meeting with ministers. Melanie Juno Wolfe, convener of the Holland Park School Parent Collective, said: “Pupils are distressed by what is happening. They do not want ULT or a multi-academy trust (Mat). With no voice they have had to resort to protesting. There is no PTA or body other than this large collective.” The group has accused the school’s interim governing body of being “detached” and failing to fill parent governor vacancies before the decision was taken to make ULT the preferred academy provider. The interim body was put in place by the DfE after allegations of a toxic environment, including bullying and humiliation of staff and pupils, misleading Ofsted and poor safeguarding practices under the recently departed headteacher, Colin Hall. At the time of the allegations, Hall said: “We don’t recognise the characterisation of the school or our leadership in the allegations raised.” The Education and Skills Funding Agency issued Holland Park school with a notice to improve last year, relating to the school’s financial oversight. The new governors also set up an independent investigation, which is ongoing, into practices under Hall’s leadership. Now, says Wolfe, a large number of parents are angry about the prospect of the school “becoming part of a large academy trust which is not part of our local community”. “There is a complete lack of transparency or parental and teacher involvement. We have been cut out of any discussions. ULT is presented as the only option.” The government announced in its schools white paper, published in March, that it wants all schools to become part of multi-academy trusts by 2030. In a move that could set a precedent for how the mass academisation policy develops, parents are pushing for Holland Park to continue as a stand-alone academy or to join forces with the local authority and nearby Kensington Aldridge academy, which had close links with Grenfell Tower and lost four pupils in the 2017 fire. Parents allege that a bid put in by KAA to form a trust with Holland Park was not given sufficient consideration by the governors. Wolfe says the parents feel as if ministers see Holland Park as “ripe for the picking”. “It is our community school. We would like to retain our identity and character and if we must join a multi-academy trust it should be rooted in the local community.” A petition opposing the Mat takeover has attracted hundreds of signatures and Michael Gove’s ex-wife, the journalist Sarah Vine, weighed into the debate when the ULT decision was announced, tweeting: “Why is a company based in Peterborough being put in charge of a school in west London. How can they possibly have any idea what’s best for our students?” The local Tory council, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, has spoken out about the chaotic situation at the school following Hall’s departure. The lead member for children’s services, Josh Rendell, broke local election purdah last week to call on the ULT takeover to be halted immediately. And the executive director of children’s services, Sarah Newman, issued a statement criticising the lack of communication between the school and parents. “Over recent months there have been many reports of problematic and rowdy behaviour of students outside the school,” she said. “Last week a child was harmed, and a teacher was taken seriously ill. This week a teacher has left the school in tears and more than 200 pupils were involved in a riot to protest the future plans being made about their school and to express their concern about their teachers. The situation has now escalated to such a level that the council is calling for immediate intervention by the Department for Education.” In its white paper, the government hinted that local authorities might now be encouraged to have a stronger role in any new academy arrangements, which is why local campaigners are puzzled that the Kensington Aldridge academy bid was not seen as a good option. A spokesperson for KAA said it believed that its own bid to form a partnership with Holland Park and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea was compelling. “We wanted to address the historic problems in the school, which we understood well given the number of Holland Park students who join our sixth form. We also wanted to keep the leadership and governance of Holland Park local and preserve the distinctive identity of the school.” A spokesperson for the DfE said that one of the conditions of the notice to improve was that the school should consider joining a multi-academy trust. “The school’s existing trust board has followed a thorough process and concluded that the best multi-academy trust to support the school’s needs is United Learning,” he said. “They are now undertaking a period of stakeholder engagement, including with parents, before a formal proposal is submitted to the department.” And a spokesperson for the Holland Park school governing body said that there were exceptionally serious issues at the school that dated back many years and led to the appointment of a new trustee (governing) board last year. “The trustees gave all bids serious consideration before identifying United Learning as its preferred provider as they believe it is the strong, expert Mat that will give the school the support it needs. “We are aware some parents do not agree with this. There are also many who desperately want action taken. The governors’ priority and guiding principle is to make sure the school is again fit for purpose and providing the first-class education that students have a right to expect. It is simply not possible for this to be achieved without significant, long-overdue change. “The final decision on the school’s future will be taken by the government. The governors will make no recommendation until after the end of the stakeholder engagement process. This process is an opportunity for all interested parties to have their say, whether they are in favour of the proposal or not.”",News/Education,‘Pupils are distressed’: community fights top London school’s takeover,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/03/pupils-are-distressed-community-fights-top-london-schools-takeover
5/4/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is inflicting damage to the country’s infrastructure at a cost of $4.5bn (£3.6bn) a week as bombs tear through thousands of buildings and public utilities, and miles of road. According to estimates compiled by the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE), and supported by the Ukrainian government, the total amount of direct infrastructure damage has reached $92bn since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion in February. Academics said the figure rose by almost $4.5bn in the week to 2 May, adding that their estimate is probably lower than the true cost because losses from the war are hard to quantify. With losses since the invasion having risen to about 60% of annual economic output, the researchers said Ukraine was suffering heavy damage to infrastructure that will be expensive to repair or rebuild. The KSE said its project, Russia Will Pay, was based on analysis of thousands of reports of damage caused during the invasion, which have been submitted by citizens, government agencies and local authorities. The snapshot showed that the bulk of the infrastructure costs relate to bomb damage inflicted on buildings, roads, factories and businesses, based on the open-source data project to track the cost of the war. More than 33,000 sq metres of residential buildings have been hit by missiles, bombs and suffered other damage during the war, worth almost $30bn in total. More than 23,000km of road have been ripped up or pockmarked by shelling, and almost 90,000 cars, worth billions of dollars combined, have been damaged. The KSE said the overall economic costs of the war – when damage to infrastructure is taken with the impact on GDP, the cessation of investments and the outflow of workers as millions flee the country – could rise to $600bn, almost four times the value of annual GDP. The figures compare with estimates made by the World Bank in mid-April, which suggested that physical infrastructure worth about $60bn had been damaged, a figure that was expected to continue rising. Last month, the International Monetary Fund said Ukraine’s economy would probably contract by about 35% this year, while the loss of life, destruction of infrastructure and exodus of workers would severely impede its economy for many years to come, even if the war ended soon. Boris Johnson, who addressed the Ukrainian parliament on Tuesday, suggested in March that Ukraine might need a “new Marshall plan”, referring to the US aid package used after the second world war to help rebuild the economies of Europe. The IMF has provided $1.4bn in emergency financing to help meet Ukraine’s immediate spending needs, while the World Bank is mobilising financial support worth about $2.5bn.",News/World news,Russia’s war in Ukraine ‘causing £3.6bn of building damage a week’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/russias-war-in-ukraine-causing-36bn-of-building-damage-a-week
5/4/2022,"More than 200 Spanish mobile numbers were selected as possible targets for surveillance by an NSO Group client believed to be Morocco, according to the data leak at the heart of the Pegasus project. Details of the scale of the apparent targeting came as Spain’s highest criminal court opened an investigation into how the mobile phones of the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the defence minister, Margarita Robles, came to be infected with Pegasus spyware last year. The Spanish government has refused to speculate on who may have been behind the “illicit” and “external” attacks, the existence of which it revealed on Monday at a hastily called press conference. The targeting of the prime minister is alleged to have taken place in May and June last year – a particularly turbulent time in Spanish politics. Not only was the Sánchez administration preparing its controversial and deeply divisive pardons of nine Catalan independence leaders jailed over their parts in the failed secession attempt in 2017, Spain was also engaged in a tense diplomatic row with Morocco. The mobile number selections believed to have been made by Morocco occurred in 2019, according to time stamps in the data, which includes more than 50,000 numbers of individuals selected as possible surveillance targets by NSO clients around the world. A Spanish mobile number belonging to Aminatou Haidar, a prominent human rights activist in Morocco, was included in the leaked database and found to have been targeted by Pegasus dating back to 2018, according to an analysis by Amnesty International. Traces of the Pegasus spyware, which is sold by the Israeli company NSO Group, were also found on a second phone belonging to Haidar as recently as November 2021. A Spanish mobile number for the journalist Ignacio Cembrero – whose work is focused on the Maghreb – was also listed on the Pegasus project database. The inclusion of more than 200 Spanish mobile numbers selected by a client believed to be Morocco does not indicate that every number was targeted or hacked. But it signals the client was apparently active in seeking out possible targets for surveillance within Spain. NSO said the fact a number appeared on the leaked list was in no way indicative of whether a number was targeted for surveillance using Pegasus. NSO has also said the database had “no relevance” to the company. Morocco previously denied spying on any foreign leaders using Pegasus, and has said reporters investigating NSO were “incapable of proving [the country had] any relationship” with NSO. But an analysis of the leaked records showed Morocco appeared to have listed dozens of French officials as candidates for possible surveillance, including President Emmanuel Macron. NSO has said its spyware is only sold to government clients for the purposes of investigating serious crime and terrorism. It has said it investigates legitimate allegations of abuse and strongly denied Pegasus was ever used to target Macron. The attacks came to light as the Spanish government continued to face questions over how Pegasus was allegedly used to monitor dozens of members of the Catalan independence movement, including the president of the north-eastern Spanish region, Pere Aragonès, and three of his predecessors. The pro-independence Catalan regional government has pointed the finger at Spain’s national intelligence centre (CNI), which insists its operations are overseen by the supreme court and that it acts “in full accordance with the legal system, and with absolute respect for the applicable laws”. On Tuesday, a judge at Spain’s Audiencia Nacional announced the beginning of an inquiry into “a possible offence of the discovery and revelation of secrets” relating to the use of Pegasus to infect Sanchez’s and Robles’s devices. Recent media reports suggest the phone of a third politician – the then Spanish foreign minister, Arancha González Laya – was also targeted with some kind of spyware in May last year. The row between Spain and Morocco occurred after the Madrid government allowed Brahim Ghali, a Western Sahara independence leader, to be treated for Covid-19 in Spain. Over the following days, as more than 8,000 people crossed from Morocco to Spain’s north African enclave of Ceuta, Rabat’s ambassador in Madrid appeared to draw a line between Ghali’s treatment and the influx of migrants, warning that some actions had consequences that “need to be assumed”. At a weekly press conference in Madrid on Tuesday, the Spanish government’s spokesperson refused to comment on whether Morocco may have been behind the Pegasus attack, and on what effect such action could have on diplomatic relations. “It’s a bit hypothetical to talk about what the consequences could be – if we’re able to find out where the attack came from,” said Isabel Rodríguez. “But what we’re clear about is that this attack was external and illicit. Those are the certainties we can use to make decisions on at the moment.” The government has ruled out any internal spying, adding the targeting must have come from abroad as any such monitoring in Spain would have required judicial authorisation. Rodríguez said the government had nothing to hide and promised full collaboration with any judicial investigation, “including declassifying relevant documents should it prove necessary”. On Tuesday, Sánchez’s Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE) joined the three parties on the Spanish right in vetoing a parliamentary inquiry into the Pegasus scandal. A PSOE spokesperson said the mooted congressional committee was not needed as an internal investigation by Spain’s national intelligence centre was already under way, as was an inquiry by the public ombudsman. The decision did not go down well with the PSOE’s junior coalition partners in the far-left, anti-austerity Unidas Podemos alliance, nor with the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party (ERC) on whose support the minority government relies in parliament. Gabriel Rufián, the ERC’s spokesperson, described the use of Pegasus as “a major scandal” and said it needed to be investigated. The Pegasus project is an investigative collaboration involving 16 media partners including the Guardian, the Wire, the Washington Post and Le Monde, and is coordinated by the French non-profit Forbidden Stories.

5/4/2022,"Democratic lawmakers in more than a dozen states are following California’s lead in seeking to offer legal refuge to displaced transgender youth and their families. The coordinated effort, which was announced on Tuesday by the LGBTQ Victory Institute and other advocates, comes in response to recent actions taken in conservative states. In Texas, for example, Gregg Abbott, the governor, has directed state agencies to consider placing trans children in foster care, though a judge has temporarily blocked such investigations. And multiple states have approved measures prohibiting gender-affirming healthcare treatments for trans youth. To combat such moves, lawmakers in both Minnesota and New York recently filed refuge state legislation modeled after the bill proposed in March by state senator Scott Wiener in California. Democrats in 16 other states plan to follow suit, though about half of their legislatures are out of session or not currently accepting new bills. GOP lawmakers have proposed more than 300 anti-LGBTQ+ laws this year so far, with roughly half of the bills specifically targeting trans youth. Wiener said he immediately began hearing from other states after coming forward with his bill, which would reject any out-of-state court judgments removing children from their parents’ custody because they allowed gender-affirming healthcare. It also would make arrest warrants based on alleged violation of another state’s law against receiving such care the lowest priority for California law enforcement. “We’re sick of just playing defense against what these red states are doing,” Wiener said on Monday. “We’re going on offense, we’re going to protect LGBTQ kids and their families and we’re going to build a rainbow wall to protect our community.” Also joining the effort are LGBTQ lawmakers in Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia. Annise Parker, president and CEO of the Victory Institute, acknowledged that the legislation would probably fail in some states but said it was time to stand against the onslaught of bills targeting the LGBTQ community. “This is our opportunity to drive the conversation and the debate, and to call on our allies proactively to step up instead of allowing ourselves to be targeted,” said Parker, who was the first openly LGBTQ mayor of a major American city when she led Houston for six years. “We would love to see these bills in states where there are more progressive legislatures,” she said. “But we also think it’s important that trans kids and their families out there see and hear legislators from our community standing up and defending them.” Wiener said it was despicable that any family would have to consider moving to a new state to protect a child, but if that happens, he hoped as many states as possible would welcome them. “When your kid is being threatened with removal from your home, families are going to consider a lot of different options, and we just want to be clear that if you decide that’s the option for you, we’re going to do everything we can do to welcome you and protect you,” he said.",News/World news,Democrats in states across US seek to offer legal refuge to trans youth,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/trans-youth-legal-refuge-states-lgbtq-laws-democrats
5/4/2022,"One Nation was still scrambling to find people to run for this month’s federal election just hours before the close of nominations, telling one prospective candidate to leave the electorate he was running in “blank” on his form while the party desperately tried to fill seats. The Guardian can also reveal that several of the candidates chosen to run for the party live in other states from the seat they’re standing in, including a husband and wife couple selected to run in separate seats in New South Wales and Victoria. Pauline Hanson said last month that One Nation would field candidates in all of the House of Representative seats for the first time thanks to “enormous support” from membership, which she said had “grown exponentially” during the pandemic. “It’s taken almost 12 months to bed down the team we’re taking to voters at this election,” she said at the time. But internal emails seen by the Guardian show the party was still trying to find people to run for it just hours before the nominating deadline on 21 April, telling one prospective candidate One Nation didn’t “require you to do anything or campaign at all”. Rob Sinclair says that after contacting One Nation seeking to run as their candidate in his local electorate of Parramatta, the party instead asked him to nominate for a range of other seats, including some as far away as Victoria and South Australia. Sinclair says he refused and after some negotiation believed the party had agreed to let him to stand in Parramatta. He filled out a nomination form, and on 19 April One Nation contacted him to say the form had been “lodged with the AEC”. But two days later on 21 April, the date that final nominations closed, the party again contacted Sinclair, this time telling him One Nation had “received advice from the AEC that they have not accepted your nomination form”. “Something about the form being illegible,” the party stated in an email. “Could I urgently get you to complete the attached form again and resend ASAP? We have a midday cutoff.” The party also instructed Sinclair to “leave the Division blank and leave your email blank”. At about this time, Sinclair noticed the subject line on the emails had changed from “candidate opportunity” to “Banks”. “I note you have BANKS in the subject title; we had agreed on PARRAMATTA,” he replied. “Could you please rectify this?” Eight minutes later, at 10.18am, less than two hours before nominations closed, the party replied saying One Nation already had a candidate in Parramatta but still had to fill other seats. “Can we please put you in a seat where we don’t have a candidate?” the party said in an email. “Please let me know urgently.” Sinclair refused, writing in an email: “As your goal is to simply put a name on a seat, you can choose someone else’s name”. Last week, the Guardian revealed the candidate One Nation did eventually nominate to run in Banks claimed he had “no idea” he was running in the seat. Malcolm Heffernan, who has been referred to the Australian federal police for allegedly nominating in two separate seats on other sides of the country, claimed he did not know he was a candidate for One Nation. Heffernan told Guardian Australia he originally agreed to run for the party in Banks, despite thinking it was “weird” because he lives in Western Australia. He filled out a nomination form, but says he was later told his “services were no longer required”. Believing One Nation no longer wanted him to run, he says he instead nominated for the little-known Australian Federation party in WA. Last week he said he was “massively annoyed” at being referred to the AFP for potential breaches of the Electoral Act. “It’s 100% not my fault,” he said. One Nation said on Friday that it would “fully cooperate with the AFP’s investigation” and would undertake its own internal investigation. Banks is not the only electorate in which the party appears to have waited until late in the nomination process to field a candidate. Ben Raue, who runs the Tally Room election site, noted that 10 days before the close of nominations, only 57 One Nation candidates appeared to have registered to run. By the close of nominations they had filled 149 seats, two short of their initial goal. The emails to Sinclair also suggest the party was not concerned about fielding active candidates in seats such as Parramatta or Banks. When he submitted his nomination form for Parramatta, One Nation told Sinclair there was “nothing more you need to do other than vote for One Nation on May 21”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning When Sinclair asked what he should do if he was “asked by anyone for an opinion on anything policy related”, the party replied that he should read the party’s website. He was given an email address to send any media responses for approval. As the party tried to convince Sinclair to run in Banks on 21 April, he was told: “We don’t require you to do anything or campaign at all.” While Hanson boasted in April that the party’s membership had soared due to Covid-era lockdowns, many of its candidates are running in seats thousands of kilometres from where they will vote on election day. There is no requirement in Australia that candidates live in their electorate. The party’s eventual candidate in Parramatta, Heather Freeman, for example, runs a business offering counselling, hypnotherapy, and “equine assisted growth and learning” with an address in Heathcote in Victoria. When the Guardian contacted her this week Freeman confirmed she was the party’s candidate, but would not answer questions about where she lived. However the AEC confirmed Freeman had nominated from a Heathcote address. In another example, Darrin Marr is running in the seat of Kingsford-Smith, about 950 kilometres from the Victorian seat of Flinders where his wife Cynthia is One Nation’s candidate. Asic filings list the couple’s address as the seaside Victorian town of Rosebud, within Flinders, where they run a real estate agency on the Mornington Peninsula. The AEC confirmed Darrin Marr had also nominated from Rosebud. In the inner-west Sydney seat held of Grayndler, held by opposition leader Anthony Albanese, One Nation’s candidate is Paul Henselin, who has previously run for the party in the Queensland state seat of Scenic Rim. In a video posted to One Nation senator Malcolm Robert’s Facebook in 2020, Henselin described himself as a “fifth generation” resident of south-east Queensland. “There’s even a street named after us,” he said. The Guardian attempted to contact both Darrin and Cynthia Marr and Henselin.

5/4/2022,"The Morrison government has been accused of stalling action to prevent the importation of goods made using slave labour, as it insists it needs more time to consult business and upgrade IT systems. Despite repeatedly raising concerns about forced labour practices in China’s Xinjiang region, the government has cited “practical challenges” in a new report explaining why it cannot immediately take up recommendations of a bipartisan committee. Anti-slavery campaigners say they are “disillusioned that the ‘fair go’ values we hold as a people are not reflected in this government response”. A Senate committee chaired by the Liberal senator Eric Abetz had called for the Customs Act to be amended “to prohibit the import of any goods made wholly or in part with forced labour, regardless of geographic origin”. The committee, whose deputy chair was the late Labor senator Kimberley Kitching, had also pushed for a US-style system to tighten scrutiny of specific goods, companies and regions with a particularly high risk of forced labour. The Australian Border Force should then consider restricting cotton from Xinjiang, according to the Senate’s foreign affairs, defence and trade legislation committee’s unanimous report last year. However, in a formal response tabled quietly after the election caretaker period began, the government said only that it agreed “in principle” with those recommendations. The government said it would “work with domestic and international partners to further explore the merit and feasibility” of the proposed changes, but raised “significant practical, administration and enforcement challenges”. It said “intelligence, IT systems and operational activities” were not at the level required to reliably determine whether forced labour had been used in the manufacture of imported goods. One major reason was “the complexity of modern day supply chains”. Such a change would require an “expensive” and “long term overhaul of the current regulatory framework and supporting IT systems”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Carolyn Kitto, the Sydney-based co-director of Be Slavery Free, said this admission from the government was “more than a little embarrassing”. She said: “Would we prefer that Australian businesses doing the right thing are placed at a competitive disadvantage to those who are knowingly or unknowingly using forced labour in producing products while we wait for IT systems to get updated in the Department of Home Affairs? “Actually, the systems and processes exist. Let’s get on with it.” Kitto said Australia would not be acting alone if it banned the import of products made with forced labour, given “the countries we share intelligence and data with are already enacting this kind of legislation”. “The USA is doing it, the UK is doing it, the EU is doing it, Japan is talking about it. Canada has been doing it,” she said. The Modern Slavery Act that passed the parliament in 2018 is limited in its scope, with only Australia’s biggest companies – those with annual revenue of more than $100m – required to submit annual statements on the steps they are taking to address modern slavery in their supply chains and operations.

One of the measures proposed by the Senate committee is similar to “withhold release orders” that have operated in the US for years. This tool would allow the ABF to designate targeted goods as having been made with forced labour unless companies can prove otherwise. In response, the government reiterated that it was “concerned with the reports in relation to forced labour in Xinjiang” but noted “that before any such steps could be carefully considered by government, it will consult in depth with industry and business”. The government said it believed Australian businesses should voluntarily put in place due diligence policies – something it saw as “a preferable initial mechanism to government-enforced prohibitions”. But Kitto said: “Imagine if we applied the same principles of agnostic, voluntary responses to security, taxes and foreign aid.” Before the election campaign began, the government formally launched a scheduled review of the Modern Slavery Act. The government said the review would consider “whether additional measures such as penalties or an Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner are required”. The South Australian independent senator Rex Patrick said the government’s response “bears all the hallmarks of a government prior to an election trying to look like they’re doing something but without any real commitment or urgency”. “Once again we see the Liberal-National Coalition government wanting to push everything aside by saying they will conduct a review,” Patrick said. Patrick’s bill to tighten the Customs Act passed the Senate last August with the support of Labor and the Greens, but it never took effect because it did not get the nod from the Coalition-controlled lower house. Be Slavery Free vowed to work with MPs and senators after the election to ensure they understood what was at stake for Australia and Australian businesses if no action was taken. Abetz did not respond to requests for comment on the government’s response to his committee’s report. Labor has signalled it would toughen the Modern Slavery Act to penalise businesses that failed to remove risks in supply chains, citing “a growing number of horrifying reports of forced labour and human rights violations in China and in many other countries”. China denies all allegations of forced labour in Xinjiang or of human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims and other minorities, but the US government and several western parliaments have labelled the Chinese government’s actions as “genocide”.",News/Australia news,Coalition accused of stalling ban on imports made using slave labour,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/04/coalition-accused-of-stalling-ban-on-imports-made-using-slave-labour
5/4/2022,"Elijah Armstrong’s wheelchair is 76cm wide. The doorways at the rental home he shares with his family are 78cm wide. “Every time he goes through a door I think: ‘is he alright getting through the door? Can he make it?’” his mother, Grace Dlabik, says. “You’re never able to live comfortably knowing that everything is OK in the home. You’re always mindful, and you’re hyperaware every time he’s using the space that he might potentially crash into something.” Elijah has cerebral palsy. He’s quadriplegic, and uses an electric wheelchair. A house that was accessible for his needs would have doorways that were 90cm wide. It would have a hoist on the ceiling, so Dlabik and her partner, Morganne Blackburn, would not have to manoeuvre the portable hoist into his bedroom each morning. It would have a shower that could comfortably fit a shower chair, instead of one that only just squeezes in. But accessible housing for families is in short supply, so Dlabik has made the best of what is available on the private rental market. They moved into their current home, a large art deco house in the Melbourne suburb of Pascoe Vale, in September. Dlabik found it during a daily scour of realestate.com.au, after spending a year searching for an accessible property. “Elijah is 19 now, and we’ve never had accessible housing,” Dlabik says. “This particular property isn’t accessible by the standards of accessible housing, it just is a lot more accessible than any other house that we’ve ever been able to find.” The house is beautiful, with large living areas and original mouldings. The formal entryway is wide enough for the 5m turning circle of Armstrong’s wheelchair. “For us, it’s not a luxury to be living in a double-fronted renovated home, it just is a necessity,” she says. Their story is a common one. The national disability insurance scheme (NDIS) funds specialist disability accommodation, but the waiting list is long and the packages lean toward shared accommodation models, with several adults sharing a home with the assistance of live-in support workers. Elijah has received funding to live in shared accommodation but it would mean moving out of home, something he does not want to do. NDIS also funds home modification projects, but it is a significant hurdle to get a landlord to agree. The national construction code was modified last year to require all new builds to have basic accessibility features, but those changes do not meet all Elijah’s needs. “There needs to be a much more holistic approach where people with disabilities have choice and control in who cares for them,” says Dlabik. “Supporting families to stay together should be a priority especially because Elijah doesn’t want to live out of home. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “There should be an option for us to stay together as a family and not be forced to relinquish care just because we don’t have the funds to build an accessible house.” Dr Di Winkler, the chief executive of the Summer Foundation, which advocates for housing options for people with disabilities, says that appropriate housing “not only leads to better outcomes for the person, it actually reduces the need for costly supports”. “The one-size-fits-all model of housing for people with disability has proven to be a disaster on so many levels over many decades,” Winkler says. “Housing that truly meets the needs of an individual is essential both for the quality of lives of people with disability and for the sustainability of the NDIS.” It took 12 months of searching for Dlabik to find the home they now live in. She began a citywide search for an accessible property, which involved a public call out on social media, support from high-profile Melbourne advocates like Carly Findlay, and an appearance on ABC Radio. It did not turn up any wheelchair-accessible homes. Dlabik also wrote to realestate.com.au and domain.com.au to request they introduce a search filter for accessible housing. The REA Group told Guardian Australia that adding that search option was “currently under consideration on realestate.com.au and is actively being rolled out across another REA Group platform as part of our ongoing improvements”. In the end, she found the house by scouring real estate websites, looking through every photo of every listing to gauge whether they might be suitable. The house was at the outer edge of their search area – Elijah’s allied health professionals and Dlabik’s business are all located in the inner north. But after periods of homelessness – followed by a stay in a rental house where they had to bring in a bath from the garden to bathe Elijah in the kitchen, carrying him up and down steps – it was too good to pass up. The halls are wide enough that Elijah can move around the house by himself and it has an accessible tram stop right out the front. The rent is $3,300 a month, a figure that eats up most of Dlabik’s income. “We are struggling every month to make the rent, pay the bills … it never gives us hope for the future,” Dlabik says. “We can’t put aside money to be able to pay for our own home at some point. “And it’s not because we want to live in a luxurious house like this, but because it’s a necessity for us and if we don’t have this we have nothing. I’ll have to start from scratch again and scour through every single listing again for another year.” A 2018 study, based on data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, found that 11.2% of Australians with disability were living in unaffordable housing. Unaffordable housing was defined as a person on a low income who spends 30% or more of their income on housing costs. Others who spoke to Guardian Australia were spending considerably more than that. Hazel*, a 24-year-old from Sydney, spends 63% of their fortnightly income to rent a one bedroom apartment in Dulwich Hill. The rent is $350 a week. It was the cheapest apartment they were able to find in Sydney’s inner west within a manageable distance to their therapist’s office. “A home is so important to me, especially having experienced homelessness and domestic violence. I just need somewhere safe that I can be, and this is that,” they say. Hazel is autistic, has PTSD and shares their home with a trainee assistance dog. Their housing needs are not complex, but they cannot live in a sharehouse. They receive the disability support pension, plus an additional $130 a fortnight in rent assistance. After paying rent, they have just over $300 a fortnight to cover bills and groceries. Their NDIS package covers support workers but no accommodation costs. “So many people have had their NDIS packages cut recently that I don’t want to have a review to ask for accommodation support, in case I lose what I already have,” they say. *Some names have been changed.",News/Australia news,One-size-fits-all model of accessible housing ‘a disaster’ for Australians with disability,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/04/one-size-fits-all-model-of-accessible-housing-a-disaster-for-australians-with-disability
5/4/2022,"Handing down his eighth Victorian budget on Tuesday, the treasurer, Tim Pallas, pitched it at not one but two elections. The most timely is the federal election. Through the budget, Pallas makes it clear that, whoever wins in May, he expects a greater share of funding for Victoria and is happy to criticise the Morrison government until then. But the most important election is, of course, the state election, set for 26 November. While there is the typical pre-state election sweetener – in the form of a $250 payment for every household that seeks out a better power deal – Pallas’s budget largely focuses on repair and recovery for the health system after two bruising years of the Covid-19 pandemic. Entitled Putting Patients First, the budget allocates $12bn to upgrading and building new hospitals, hiring and training thousands of new nurses and hundreds of triple-zero call takers and driving down the state’s growing elective surgery waiting list. In doing so, the government is clearly attempting to neutralise what has become a headline-grabbing problem. Since October last year, up to 12 Victorians have died while waiting for an ambulance – their loved ones’ calls to triple-zero either went unanswered or were picked up well outside the service’s target times. There have also been deaths in the state’s overcrowded emergency departments, including that of a 72-year-old man who waited three-and-a-half hours for a bed in regional Victoria, and harrowing stories of people spending weeks and even months in pain while on the elective surgery waitlist. The opposition has relentlessly pursued the government over this and maintains the problems with the health system existed well before the pandemic. But it will now need to come up with its own, better plan if it wants to fight an election on the issue. The government is also attempting to neutralise another favourite attack line from the opposition – that it can’t manage its finances, with a modest $650m surplus forecast for the 2025-26 financial year. But by then, Victoria will reach a record net debt level of $167.5bn, or 26% of gross state product. The treasurer is confident the government will be able to drive that down, using the newly created Victorian Future Fund, made up of proceeds from the privatisation of VicRoads number plate and registration services and yet-to-be-announced land sales to repay Covid borrowings. The fund is projected to have a balance of about $10bn in the medium term, with more details expected to be announced in July. The opposition says it will soon unveil its own plans to drive debt down more quickly. It’s looking increasingly likely that the state election will be played out on traditional turf. Labor will spruik its investments in health, education and infrastructure, while the Coalition will say it can efficiently manage the economy. In the meantime, $2.3bn is allocated for “funding not allocated to specific purposes” over the next four years – so Victorians can expect more announcements before the poll. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But there is one important event before then. Released during the federal election campaign, a whole chapter of Budget Paper 2 is dedicated to “Victoria’s economic recovery despite insufficient Commonwealth support”. It outlines how Canberra has consistently given Victoria less than its “fair share” of infrastructure funding, and how the GST carve-up will leave the state worse off come 2026-27. Pallas told reporters the GST deal is “the worst public policy disaster this nation’s had since we decided to build Canberra”. This was a clear riff on his federal counterpart Josh Frydenberg’s statement during the Melbourne lockdowns that they were the worst public policy disaster in Australian history.

This all means less for our hospitals and schools, for roads and rail,” he said. “The commonwealth government, whoever they are, must stop short-changing hard-working Victorians and give us our fair share … funding Victoria fairly is not foreign aid – this is simply what Victorians are entitled to, as Australians. “Our federation won’t function effectively if the commonwealth disappears in our hour of need and treats Victorians as second-class citizens.” Pallas is clearly seeking to remind Victorians of the failures of the prime minister, Scott Morrison, during the pandemic, and of Frydenberg kicking the state while it was down. While the budget seeks to repair the damage of the past two years, it’s clear some wounds are yet to heal. How deep they are will be revealed at both elections.",News/Australia news,Victorian government delivers a budget that’s a tale of two elections,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/04/victorian-government-delivers-a-budget-thats-a-tale-of-two-elections
5/4/2022,"Alex Garland’s next film, Men, is due for release in June. If you’re intrigued by the mysterious trailer, or you enjoyed either his acclaimed TV series Devs, or the sci-fi horror of Annihilation, then Garland’s directorial debut, Ex Machina, is well worth investigating. Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) wins a competition at his workplace to visit the home of the company’s reclusive CEO, Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Caleb travels to his vast and remote Norwegian estate and, upon arrival, discovers the contest was a smokescreen. Identified as a gifted employee, Caleb has been summoned to work on Nathan’s latest project: an artificial intelligence named Ava (Alicia Vikander). It is Caleb’s job to administer the Turing Test (named after its creator, mathematician Alan Turing), to determine whether Ava has genuine consciousness. If the tester cannot determine if the subject is machine or human, then the test is passed. Ava is the enigma at the centre of everything and Vikander portrays her with a wealth of humanity. When Caleb and Ava meet, there is no Uncanny Valley – the feeling of revulsion or unease when presented with a realistic machine – rather, he is immediately drawn to Ava. Before long they share a mutual attraction. But as their discussions continue, Ava confides in Caleb that Nathan is not to be trusted. With this tense, psychological thriller, Garland asks the biggest question of all – what does it mean to be alive? Ex Machina is essentially 108 minutes of three people sitting around talking to each other, but this existential grappling is so compelling that it is impossible not to be drawn into both the story and the bigger questions that motivate it. The question of Ava’s consciousness is only the start, because Caleb’s decision will have huge consequences. If we believe Ava is alive, will she be allowed to live that life on her own terms? Will her artificial life be held to the same standard as human life? Ava is corporate property, so at what point does the machine transcend its origin as an object and become a person? But Ex Machina is still, at heart, a paranoid thriller and the three central performances from Vikander, Gleeson and Isaac make the story just as absorbing as the questions it asks. They inhabit these conflicting, manipulative personalities so completely, we’re never quite sure of the truth – or whose truth – to believe. Nathan is initially welcoming, but despite his pleas for Caleb to ignore the employer-employee dynamic, Caleb is always aware of the power disparity between them. Isolated by both his wealth and geographical location, his only (human) company in his vast tech facility is his housekeeper, Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno), who does not speak English; a paranoid safeguard for Nathan’s trade secrets. His darker side emerges: he drinks heavily, becomes aggressive and is prone to the bouts of egotism. He considers Caleb to be the weaker man, both intellectually and physically, and never misses a chance to demonstrate his machismo – be it skipping to the top of a fjord while Caleb struggles, or pointedly lifting weights while engaged in a daily debrief. The score, from Geoff Barrow of Portishead and Ben Salisbury, adds an extra dimension as an ambient sonic atmosphere crafted to match the dark, labyrinthine corridors of the tech facility and the sweeping panoramas of the Norwegian countryside. Garland’s career as a novelist means he knows how to tell a good story and Ex Machina is an accomplished thriller. But like the very best science fiction, its big ideas are only partially contained by the script. Ex Machina is that rare type of film that draws you in so completely, you will never stop thinking about it.",Arts/Film,"Ex Machina: when you see this sci-fi thriller, you’ll never stop thinking about it",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/03/ex-machina-when-you-see-this-sci-fi-thriller-youll-never-stop-thinking-about-it
5/4/2022,"Teachers in New South Wales will go ahead with a planned strike on Wednesday despite an 11th-hour plea from the government for the union to delay action until after the June budget. Teachers will walk off the job for the second time in five months, amid long-running concerns over wages and conditions. It is the latest in a series of strikes in the state’s public service, with train drivers, nurses and paramedics recently taking such industrial action. While each of the unions have different demands, at the heart of the complaints is the government’s longstanding 2.5% wage cap for public servants. The government has sought to head off the strike by saying it will review the cap when it delivers the state budget next month, and on Tuesday the education minister, Sarah Mitchell, gave the clearest indication yet that the government was reviewing public sector wages. With award negotiations for teachers set to be heard in the NSW Industrial Relations Commission this month, Mitchell told reporters she had asked for them to be delayed until after the June budget. “The premier has made it clear in comments that he’s made that the government is looking at the wages policy as part of those budget considerations, and therefore I would like IRC determinations to be made after the budget,” she said. “I have relayed that to the Teachers Federation this morning, in good faith, and asked them to consider their industrial action proposed for tomorrow. “So the onus really now is on union bosses to make decisions about what they want to do.” The premier, Dominic Perrottet, said while he appreciated teacher concerns he would not be “threatened by union bosses”. “What I have said is that we are working through all of the industrial issues across the NSW public service and doing it in a holistic way,” Perrottet said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But the head of the NSW Teachers Federation, Angelo Gavrielatos, insisted the strike would go ahead and said the union had been attempting to negotiate on wages since early last year. “We have been very patient,” he said, adding that the federation wrote to the government as recently as February seeking negotiations on pay. Gavrielatos said the government had given “no guarantee” of a wage rise for teachers. “Last week we got a vague announcement by the premier that they will look at salaries in the context of the budget,” he said. The government is under increasing pressure to scrap the wage cap, amid increasing pressures on cost of living including rising inflation and the Reserve Bank of Australia decision to raise interest rates on Tuesday.

The banks are about to take a big bite out of their take-home pay and until the wage cap is lifted there’ll be little relief in the form of higher wages,” Morey said. “As the nation’s largest employer, the NSW government’s miserable stinginess is also holding back workers in the private sector from getting a pay rise that keeps pace with the cost of living. “The wage cap must go now. The longer it stays in place the higher the risk of NSW losing key workers to other states where pay rises are easier to gain and the cost of housing is lower.”",News/Australia news,Teachers to strike despite plea from NSW government to delay industrial action,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/04/teachers-to-strike-despite-plea-from-nsw-government-to-delay-industrial-action
5/4/2022,"An expert radiologist says Australian federal police continued to use wrist X-rays to prosecute children as adult people smugglers after he had given unequivocal evidence of the technique’s unreliability, something he now says was “just wrong” and akin to “child abuse”. Last week, six Indonesian boys won a major case overturning their convictions as adult people smugglers in 2010 amid the highly charged political atmosphere around border protection. The children, then as young as 13, were prosecuted and jailed using analysis of X-rays of their wrists, which police said proved they were adults. A trove of documents attached to their cases, seen by Guardian Australia, shows the boys all repeatedly told navy, immigration and police members they were children, which should have seen them sent back to Indonesia under federal police policy. Police instead took the dates of birth they provided and altered the year to make their ages align with the wrist X-ray evidence, placing the new dates on sworn legal documents. The six boys – and dozens of others – were imprisoned in maximum security adult correctional facilities in Western Australia. The wrist X-ray technique has since been entirely discredited, but the documents also show an officer working some of the cases was told years before the six boys’ convictions that the technique was inexact and open to error. Senior government figures were also warned about the unreliability of the technique prior to the boys’ convictions through an immigration department briefing. The radiologist Dr James Christie began to appear as a defence expert witness in similar people smuggling cases after the six boys were convicted in 2010. His evidence warned that wrist X-ray comparisons were never intended as a means of assessing age and that the key reference tool on bone development police were relying on had no data on Indonesian populations. Christie gave evidence that the technique had no scientific validity, and was based on a “cascading sequence of unknown factors and incorrect assumptions to attempt to provide a level of precision about estimation of chronological age that does not exist”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Christie was shocked when police continued to use the technique. “We won and we kept on winning and they just kept on doing the same stupid thing,” he said. “There was no evidence that anyone seemed to really care. It was really frustrating, and I remain incredibly frustrated. “I was saying ‘this test was never designed for this, it’s not appropriate, here’s all the evidence about why it’s a bad idea. You cannot prove that somebody is this age by using this’. “I would have said that in every report, and I think as time went on, I got even better at it because we found more and more evidence that it was wrong and it was being used inappropriately.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app The radiologist said prosecutions failed in cases where he and another witness, a statistician from the UK, gave evidence for the defence. “But even when that was happening and when we were successful, for whatever reason, the federal police kept on going with the same argument, over and over and over again,” he said. “I don’t believe they actually talked to anybody who actually knew anything about the use of this test. You’d think ‘do you guys not learn?’ or ‘are you just hoping to look tough?. It just didn’t make any sense.” “These kids, it’s entirely possible that some of them were not under 18, I don’t know that for sure. But a substantial number were. It was just wrong.

5/4/2022,"In a world of economic shocks, the questions left by Tuesday’s surprisingly large increase in the official interest rate include what will bring the next thunderbolt. After all, not one of 32 economists surveyed ahead of the Reserve Bank’s monthly meeting predicted the board would emerge with a 25 basis point cash rate increase, finally liberating it from the record low 0.1% it had hovered at since November 2020. Equally galling for forecasters had been last week’s inflation figures, which nobody saw landing with a “5” on it. The RBA governor, Philip Lowe, described the CPI as “a shock” at his post-meeting media conference, and it was clearly the prompt for the rate hike. People generally only like surprises that come with wrapping and a bow on them. After Tuesday’s upsized rate rise – economists had mostly tipped a 15 basis point increase to 0.25% – economists reached for their slide rules, phone calculators and/or ouija boards to work out where the next jolt might come from. Dashing hopes that the next nugget of novelty is easily prospected, David Plank, the head of Australian economics at ANZ, wisely reasoned that it was “not really possible for us to ‘forecast’ when we will be surprised”. “The RBA has substantially revised up its inflation forecasts, which lessens the prospect it will be only surprised to the high side,” Plank said. “But we can’t rule this out happening again. We only get quarterly inflation and wages data in Australia so the opportunities for big data surprises are relatively limited.” Indeed, wages may be where the surprise lies, and we won’t have to wait long, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics scheduled to release the wage price index (WPI) data on 18 May, only three days before the federal election. Next up, the market is predicting the RBA's cash rate will be 0.75% - or another 40 basis points higher - at the June RBA board meeting. And then the climb goes on. pic.twitter.com/AKHgH8s2sN “Expectations on wages growth are still quite muted, and so there is the potential for upside surprises here,” said Cherelle Murphy, a senior EY economist who was among the first out of the blocks after the CPI release to call for Tuesday’s rate rise. The government will be among those hoping for a surge in salaries to help counter Labor’s argument that “everything is going up except your wages” – with interest rates being added to that mounting pile. Annoyingly for economists such as Gareth Aird, head of economics at Commonwealth Bank – the nation’s biggest lender – it was the RBA’s decision to trust relatively ad hoc data on wages that blindsided his team. The CBA was among those predicting the central bank would hold fire on rates until the WPI data landed post-election. In his media conference on Tuesday, Lowe revealed the bank’s scouts had learned about 40% of firms were looking at wage increases with a “three” on them and some had a “four”. While shy of the annual 5.1% headline CPI for the March quarter, those increases suggested to Lowe that long-awaited salary increases as the jobless rate sank below 4% might now be arriving. In a briefing note on Tuesday, Aird said with some angst that “business surveys had for some time indicated that wages growth was moving higher, so it was a surprise that the board only [on Tuesday] decided to put weight on ‘unofficial’ wages data”. The RBA itself aimed to head off some of the surprises by what Aird described as its “massively upwardly” revision of future headline and underlying inflation. The RBA now expects underlying inflation – its trigger for cash rate moves – of “around” 4.75% in 2022, compared with its most recent forecast in the Statement on Monetary Policy from February of 2.75%. The adjustment of two whole percentage points for a year more than a third of the way in is “a radical revision” and means “the RBA has completely changed their view on the outlook for inflation”, Aird said. Feels like yonks ago, but here's the now very much outdated forecasts in the Morrison government's budget released 29 March. Note the RBA now expects CPI to reach 6% by the end of 2022, vs much lower predictions for years to June: #ausvotes #auspol #AusVotes2022 pic.twitter.com/CyfKPsTUIg While prime minister Scott Morrison tried to trumpet the rate hike as proof of Australia having avoided the fate of nations such as New Zealand and the US where inflation is running in the order of 7-8%, it seems more that the RBA has its work cut out heading off such levels. In fact, Australia’s exceptionalism is fading. Another surprise, then, may come in the as-yet unknowable pace the RBA is forced to raise rates and for how long. As Lowe outlined, nobody can predict with confidence how Russia’s war in Ukraine or China’s battles to maintain its zero-Covid policy will fare, both of which carry big implications for commodity prices, among other things. Lowe indicated that “normal policy” would see the cash rate rise to 2.5% even though investors were predicting even before Tuesday that level would be reached by the end of this year, on the way to 3.3% by May 2023. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The major banks, though, are not in that league of worry just yet. NAB, for instance, expects “steady” rises for the rest of this year, with three more in 2023 and two in 2024 until the cash rate peaks at 2.6%. The ANZ expects the RBA to reach 2.5% by mid-2023 and eventually lift it to “3-point something, albeit not for some time”. CBA’s Aird sees 25 basis points rate hikes in June, July, August and November this year and for it to reach 1.6% by February and staying put until the following year. Rising interest rates, of course, will add strains to many household budgets. Morrison put Tuesday’s toll at about $80 a month for the average mortgage holder, a figure that will swell by each quarter-point rate rise to come. Could that stress turn a plateauing of property prices into a rout? Brendan Rynne, a senior KPMG economist, said gloom in the market is “unlikely”, not least because the jobless rate is low and falling, and some wage increases will come after the new financial year starts in July. Also, as Lowe also pointed out, homeowners have used much of their $250bn or so savings hoarded during the Covid panel to get further ahead on their repayments. Not happy news on the consumer front, with the weekly gauge of sentiment by @ANZ_Research and Roy Morgan diving the most since mid-January amid the Omicron Covid spike and supply snarls. #ausvotes #auspol #AusVotes2022 pic.twitter.com/Fiua362DEB “A lot of Australians have been very cautious and have built up cash buffers,” Rynne said. “But not everyone” – and those borrowers will have to be watched carefully. Tim Lawless, the research director of CoreLogic, said housing price growth rates had already been losing steam, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, and would trend “into negative territory due to factors including affordability constraints, higher fixed term mortgage rates and lower levels of consumer sentiment”. Some of that consumer confidence is already waning, with the ANZ’s weekly survey finding sentiment is slumping at the fastest pace since January. “Past research from the RBA has pointed to ‘high end’ housing markets with higher investor concentrations being more sensitive to changes in interest rates in the short term,” Lawless said. Just how sensitive may then be among the surprises to come as the RBA cranks up its rate-rise machine.",News/Australia news,Shock interest rate rise shows Australia’s economic exceptionalism is fading,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/04/shock-interest-rate-rise-shows-australias-economic-exceptionalism-is-fading
5/4/2022,"Amid allegations of war crimes, of murder, and of domestic violence, the seemingly inconsequential but bizarre death of a dog has dominated days of evidence in the Ben Roberts-Smith defamation trial. It has done so because the identity of an Afghan special forces member who shot the stray dog – accidentally injuring an Australian soldier – during an SAS mission in July 2012 could prove critical in an allegation of murder made against Roberts-Smith in the newspapers’ defence. Roberts-Smith and two of his first soldier witnesses – Person 35 and Person 27 – have each now conceded before court they were wrong in their written outlines of evidence that a particular Afghan soldier – known as Person 12 – was responsible for firing on the dog and was subsequently banned from patrolling with the Australians. The evidence over the dog is potentially critical because the newspapers allege that Person 12 was present during a later Australian mission to Khaz Uruzgan in October 2012, and that Roberts-Smith ordered him to command one of his subordinates to kill a prisoner. Roberts-Smith told the court the allegation cannot be true because Person 12 wasn’t there. Person 27 told the court Tuesday morning he “never had direct knowledge” of who had shot the dog and that the first time he had heard the name of person 12 was during a meeting with Roberts-Smith’s lawyers. He told the court “Ben’s lawyers” wrote Person 12’s name in an outline of his proposed evidence which he was sent to check before it was submitted to the court. In total, five soldier witnesses – Ben Roberts-Smith and four witnesses he has called – submitted outlines of evidence that said Person 12 shot the dog dead. But coalition force documents presented before the court show that Person 12 was not on the mission that day – he was not even attached to the Australian forces when the incident with the dog occurred – leading to allegations from the newspapers Roberts-Smith and his witnesses colluded to give untruthful evidence. They have denied any complicity or collaboration. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross and one of Australia’s most decorated soldiers, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. The court has heard that in July 2012, Australian SAS were on a mission in Chenartu, in southern Afghanistan, with members of the Afghan police special forces unit, known as the Wakunish. On patrol, a Wakunish member opened fire on a stray dog, killing it. Shrapnel from the shooting ricocheted, hitting and injuring an Australian SAS soldier. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In his outline of evidence, Roberts-Smith told the court he had understood it was Person 12 who had shot the dog and that he was then removed from going on patrols with Australian soldiers. Roberts-Smith said the allegation cannot be true, because Person 12 was not on the mission, having been removed over the dog incident. The newspapers allege that towards the end of the Khaz Uruzgan mission, an Afghan prisoner who had been detained was being questioned by Roberts-Smith’s patrol through an interpreter. Also present were Wakunish members, including their commanding officer, Person 12. During the interrogation of the prisoner, a member of Roberts-Smith’s patrol kicked at a discoloured area of the compound’s mud wall that appeared to be a recently constructed false wall. From behind the false wall fell a cache of weapons, including rocket-propelled grenades. According to the newspapers’ defence documents, Roberts-Smith saw the weapons fall out and told the interpreter to order Person 12 to shoot the prisoner: “Shoot him or get his men to do it, or I’ll do it,” Roberts-Smith allegedly said. Person 12 allegedly instructed one of his subordinates to shoot the prisoner, who fired four to six shots into him, killing him. Other Australian soldiers have given evidence before the trial that they witnessed Roberts-Smith order the execution. Roberts-Smith has consistently denied the allegation he ordered the execution. He told the court there were no prisoners in the final compound at Khaz Uruzgan, and that Person 12 was not on the mission. “Did you order [the interpreter] to translate an order to Person 12 to kill a PUC?” he was asked by his barrister. “No, I did not … I never killed an unarmed prisoner.” Roberts-Smith has called three soldier witnesses in this trial, two of whom have submitted outlines of evidence that state Person 12 shot the dog. Person 35, shown evidence that Person 12 was not present the day the dog was shot, told the court “I must have misremembered … I’ve remembered incorrectly.” Nick Owens SC, acting for the newspapers, put it to him he had colluded with other soldier witnesses. “You discussed with each of those people the lie that you were going to tell about Person 12 shooting a dog, correct?” Owens said. “That’s incorrect,” Person 35 replied. Another soldier, Person 27, told the court, “I never had direct knowledge of who shot the dog.” He said he was told Person 12’s name by Roberts-Smith’s lawyers, and they had written Person 12’s name in his outline of evidence. Owens asked Person 27: “When is the first time that you can recall anybody telling you that Person 12 was the person who shot the dog and injured Person 57?” “When I met with Ben’s lawyers,” Person 27 said. Asked who had first used the name of Person 12, Person 27 said: “Ben’s lawyers.” He told the court after a teleconference with Roberts-Smith’s lawyers he was sent an outline of his proposed evidence before the court “which I was to correct”.

Person 27 was told it was not Person 12, but another Afghan national, however he did not change his outline of evidence, despite knowing it was wrong. Roberts-Smith himself had initially claimed he knew it was Person 12 who shot the dog. “I did not see Person 12, nor do I recall seeing the interpreter … during the mission,” Roberts-Smith told the court in his outline of evidence. “Person 12 was not present, as it was my understanding that Person 12 had been stood down [over the dog incident] well before this time.” In the witness box last year, Roberts-Smith told the court he later came to learn that it was not Person 12 who had been stood down for shooting the dog, but maintained the Afghan officer was not on the Khaz Uruzgan mission: “One way or another, Person 12 wasn’t there,” Roberts-Smith said. During a debate over access to documents last month, Owens told the court it was “utterly inconceivable that five people would make the same, precise, demonstrably false error” by innocent coincidence, and that the erroneous evidence represented a “fraud”. “The fraud is the collusion between witnesses … multiple witnesses colluding together in relation to the evidence they will give at trial.” Roberts-Smith’s legal team has denied the allegations of witness collusion.

5/4/2022,"Oyster fisheries in Australia and North America survived for up to 10,000 years prior to colonisation, sustaining First Nations communities even under intense harvest, according to new research. The study calls for Indigenous knowledge to be incorporated into managing oyster reefs today. Oyster fisheries have declined globally in modern times: an estimated 85% of 19th-century oyster reef area has been lost in the past 200 years. An international team of researchers studied historical oyster fisheries off Australia’s east coast as well as along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America, and the Gulf of Mexico coast. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, combined historical catch records with archaeological data on oyster abundance and geographical distribution of sites. In Australia, the research drew upon 16 known oyster middens in south-east Queensland – accumulations containing millions of oyster shells. Along Queensland’s Great Sandy Strait, these middens are “deliberately made mounded structures as monuments on the landscape”, said Prof Ian McNevin of the Monash Indigenous Studies Centre, a collaborator on the project. One such site was the Booral shell mound, on the mainland opposite K’gari (Fraser Island), which is 1.4 metres high, covers an area of 154 square metres, and contains an estimated 5.9m oyster shells. “It goes back 3,000 years – it is just jam packed with millions of oyster shells, showing that there was very intense harvesting of oysters in the past,” McNevin said. Another site, on St Helena Island, contained an estimated 50m shells. “When you look into some areas, the scale of Indigenous oyster harvesting is extraordinary – it’s almost getting up to contemporary commercial capitalist oyster harvesting intensities,” McNevin said. Commercial oyster fishing in Australia after colonisation began in the late 19th century. Records show the annual harvest in south-east Queensland of the native Saccostrea glomerata – commonly known as the Sydney rock oyster – peaked in 1891 with about 43.8m oysters. “Whatever the oyster fishing technique was, it was clearly unsustainable and it literally collapsed,” McNiven said, adding that the only notable fishery in the region now was cultivated oysters in Moreton Bay, where the harvest is around 2m yearly. In comparison, McNiven said, Aboriginal middens were monuments to thousands of years of intensive but sustainable oyster harvesting. “What we need to do is talk to First Nations people. They’re the ones with cultural and ecological knowledge that has allowed long-term sustainable oyster harvesting. “There was deliberate management and modification of these ecosystems,” McNiven added, citing oral histories of the Quandamooka people of Moreton Bay. “There wasn’t just passive harvesting … they would get the oyster shells after they’d eaten the oyster, then take it back out on to the sand flats,” he said. “They sprinkled the shells there to create a base for the oyster spat – the larvae of the oyster – to attach.” After colonisation, many First Nations people were made to pay for the right to harvest oysters. “Prior to European settlement, Butchulla women and children gathered oysters at the back of Little Woody Island [in the Great Sandy Strait],” said Lorraine Woolley, a Butchulla elder. “Everything up there was done by the seasons. You didn’t collect oysters all year – you only collected them when the meat in the oyster was fat. “When Europeans came … they started to stake out the oyster banks and then people had to have licences for them,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Woolley’s grandfather, who was an oyster fisher, wrote to the authorities at the time “for the oyster reefs to stop being robbed. They were taking the oysters [from the Great Sandy Strait] and bringing them to Moreton Bay,” Woolley said. “In the letter he says that it’s like a vegetable garden: if you keep robbing and don’t replant … it dies out,” Woolley said. “Eventually they just died out in the strait.” Woolley would like to see oyster fisheries return to the region. “They filter the water,” she said. Some oyster species are estimated to filter up to 170L a day. Leslie Reeder-Myers, an assistant professor of anthropology at Temple University in Philadelphia and the study’s first author, said the scale of the findings was striking. “This isn’t just one area. Indigenous people all over the world were fishing a lot of oysters,” she said. “There are billions of oysters in individual sites in Florida.” Researchers believe oyster fisheries have collapsed globally in modern times due to a combination of overfishing, runoff from agriculture, and clear-cutting of forests resulting in sediment in waterways. “It became evident that there was also a story of settler colonialism,” Reeder-Myers said. “As we are today trying to decide how to … repair these fisheries that have collapsed, we are continuing to make the choice to exclude Indigenous people. “This is their ecological heritage and they should be reconnected with that,” she said.",News/Environment,"Precolonial First Nations oyster fisheries sustained millennia of intense harvests, study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/04/precolonial-first-nations-oyster-fisheries-sustained-millennia-of-intense-harvests-study-shows
5/4/2022,"The third and final election debate between Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese will air on Channel Seven next Wednesday – but not until after Big Brother which is scheduled to end at 9.10pm. Seven is launching the reality franchise on Monday and nothing, not even matters of state, will be allowed to bump Big Brother. The prime minister has accepted invitations to debate the Labor leader on two commercial TV networks and Rupert Murdoch’s pay TV platform but has refused to appear on the ABC. Over the past 21 years, the Big Brother House has had a bit of a glow up! 🙌 Big Brother returns Monday on @channel7. #BBAU pic.twitter.com/83cgFX79bk The ABC repeatedly offered an earlier time slot on any day suitable to both leaders via the Insiders host, David Speers, and the broadcaster’s managing director, David Anderson. But last week Morrison suggested the ABC didn’t have much of a chance when he omitted to mention the invitation which Anderson had made public a week earlier. The live election showdown where nothing is off limits. SUNDAY, in a #60Mins special event, ScoMo versus Albo. pic.twitter.com/rZUpp6CufN “I’m happy to do two debates next week,” Morrison said while campaigning in Cairns. “Seven and Nine have both offered me debates next week. I’m happy to do both of them. I said I would do three. I’ve already done one. He said he would debate me any time. Seven and Nine, book the hall, I’ll be there.” For the ABC, the news on Monday evening that Seven had secured the 11 May debate meant the door had been slammed shut. Hours later the federal director of the Liberal party, Andrew Hirst, who had been fielding offers from the media, wrote to Anderson rejecting the ABC offer without giving an explanation. The prime minister also rejected an offer from Labor for a debate at the National Press Club to be moderated by its president, Laura Tingle, the chief political correspondent at ABC’s 7.30 program. For correspondence collectors, here was Paul Erickson, to Andrew Hirst, earlier today. See you at the press club, with ⁦@latingle⁩ asking the questions #auspol pic.twitter.com/XKgpDBH4pX Former ABC journalist Kerry O’Brien used to regularly host the broadcaster’s election debates before John Howard refused to appear during the 1996 election campaign. Although the opposition leader at the time, Howard was able to dictate his preferred platform, and he chose the Nine Network with Ray Martin. O’Brien believes the public appetite for three debates is not there – but there should have been one on the public broadcaster. “Election debates rarely prove anything of much importance about either leader’s worthiness to be the next prime minister, and I doubt there’s any hunger from the public for three of them,” O’Brien told Guardian Australia. “But if the major parties are going to have them at all, they should all be on the same neutral media territory – like the National Press Club – with a consistent format and a genuine commitment to test their policy mettle. “The fact that the debates have been divvied up amongst Rupert Murdoch, Kerry Stokes and a company called Nine Entertainment, with no room for the public broadcaster at all – the most respected news institution in the nation by a country mile – reflects very poorly on both Coalition and Labor.” New: Liberal campaign director Andrew Hirst says to Paul Erickson: we’ll do debates hosted by Nine and Seven.

When it became clear Morrison would never agree to the ABC or the press club, Albanese agreed to a debate on Seven, hosted by veteran political editor Mark Riley, and branded The Great Debate: The Final Showdown. .@AlboMP and @ScottMorrisonMP will square off in a leaders’ debate broadcast on @Channel7 & @7plus, only days out from polling day. #auspol #7NEWS https://t.co/TaxS2HSNvd Riley will moderate and there will be questions from the West Australian’s federal political editor Lanai Scarr and Seven News’ political correspondent Jennifer Bechwati.

Conservative commentator Gerard Henderson – a consistent ABC critic – said out loud what the Morrison camp was probably thinking. “There may well be a reluctance within the Liberal party to agreeing to a leaders’ debate on the ABC where, traditionally, the practice is to commission journalists – not members of the public – to ask questions or make comments, with an ABC journalist in the presenter’s chair,” he wrote in the Australian. “In fact, there is only a downside for Morrison if he appears on any form of an ABC-run leaders’ debate.”",News/Australia news,Seven’s election debate to air after Big Brother as prime minister snubs national broadcaster,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/04/sevens-election-debate-to-air-after-big-brother-as-prime-minister-snubs-national-broadcaster
5/4/2022,"“Rental prices have exploded, making it near impossible to find a new home and keep myself and my children in our community … It is extremely stressful not being able to feel secure in our home.” Working in a grassroots tenants organisation, we hear these anguished accounts too often – this one is from a single mother in Gippsland. The other day, it was an office cleaner renting a modest annexe in Melbourne’s outer north, who was debating whether to cut off electricity or pay overdue rent. The cost of living is rightly centre stage in the federal election campaign, and lately we’ve been hearing more about (some of) the challenges of housing affordability from our politicians. At the recent Labor launch there was a big idea from the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, for a shared equity scheme to help more people on moderate incomes to secure home loans, with the government taking a stake in the property. And the prime minister, Scott Morrison, had his recent foray on morning television while selling a federal budget mortgage support program when he declared the “best way to support people renting a house is to help them buy a house”. If only. When will our politicians launch a fearless public conversation about housing affordability for people who don’t have a skerrick of a chance of stepping on any rung of any mortgage ladder? When will they acknowledge that the aspiration for the increasing segment of Australians who rent in capricious private rental markets around the country is an affordable rental home with security of tenure? Broadly, in the year to December 2021, rents across Australia spiked 9.4% while wages grew on average only about 2.2%. Shortly before the Covid pandemic disrupted our lives, the Productivity Commission also shared some home truths about private renters in lower-income households – in particular, households with the lowest 40% of incomes. By 2018, more than 1 million relatively low-income households – home to 2.65 million of us – rented from private landlords. The figure has doubled in two decades and more retirees and families with children are renting privately. Tellingly, the Productivity Commission found that a whopping two-thirds of these lower-income households spent more than 30% of their income on rent, which is the very definition of “rental stress”. Many spent much more. At Tenants Victoria, a quarter of referrals to our financial counselling service in the past six months were people in rental situations that were already deeply unaffordable. Many come to us carrying debilitating rent arrears and were at risk of eviction. Key barriers they face in changing their living situations are the lack of affordable and available properties. As an immediate step, lower-income households should be the prime target for a practical national policy response by any party that is serious about tackling housing affordability. That is, an increase in the Commonwealth Rent Assistance – the subsidy for people getting a Centrelink payment who don’t live in public housing. Many welfare and housing organisations agree that the increase should be by at least 50%. Pegged to the consumer prices index, in March the maximum rental supplement for a solo renter in reality went up just $3 a fortnight – three cans of home-brand baked beans – to $145.80. Meanwhile, the Anglicare rental affordability snapshot found that of 45,992 properties advertised nationally in March just seven were affordable for a single unemployed person, even with the “top-up” of the rental subsidy. The housing affordability challenges for renters are systemic and won’t be solved in one term or by technocratic market solutions. The central government must also invest sustainably in social housing. It’s not just a state government responsibility, as the federal opposition acknowledged in its pledge to create a future fund to build 30,000 new social and affordable homes over five years. The next federal government must also lead a coordinated national housing strategy involving all layers of government and addressing all aspects of housing tenure. While issues of rental affordability are starkest for people on income support, the challenges are not confined to those in highest need. Almost a third of Australians now live in rented homes and their numbers are growing. Yet wage earners on middle incomes, including essential workers in healthcare, hospitality and retail, tell us that it’s become harder to find a suitable rental home for themselves and their families in the right areas close to jobs and services. In the face of these realities, to frame political contests on housing affordability through the lens of homeownership and mortgages alone is the stuff of, well, the last century. For many people on low-to-middle incomes, their modest Australian dream is now a safe, secure, and affordable rental. Let’s not make it a nightmare.
