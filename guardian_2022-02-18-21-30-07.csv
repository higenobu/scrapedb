2/18/2022,"Recently, while out for drinks and sharing plates, a friend reached over and took a sip of my cocktail. There are key parts of this anecdote that still, two years into the push–pull of pandemic guidance, strike nervousness into me. They include the words “dinner”, “friend”, “sharing plates”, not to mention the thought of a bathroom where there’s nice soap but the water from the tap still comes out cold and for some reason there’s no dainty way of opening the door once you’ve washed your hands, so you just have to grab the door handle with your newly washed hand, which seems to instantly negate the point of washing the hands. But the crucial information here is that I had a very nice negroni in front of me, and they wanted to try it, so they took the glass and raised it to their lips and took a sip.  In 2019, I would not have minded. That’s because All This hadn’t happened, and I considered myself fairly normal. This is no longer true. I have forgotten how to talk to anyone. How to greet people. How to meet new people. How to sit in an office. A lot of people forgot how to talk back to me, too. Restrictions are easing up, but people aren’t necessarily doing the same. So I spoke to some experts to get some guidance. If you were on any local Facebook groups over the various lockdowns, you will know that, deliriously starved of day-to-day gossip, people became obsessed with the comings and goings of their neighbours, reporting whether they wore a mask and gloves to put the bins out, or how many Amazon parcels they were getting every day. This is because, lightweight as it is, gossip is vital. “Gossip is social currency,” says Jessica Barrett, an editor at Grazia, the gossipiest magazine in the biz. “If you have some, you hold power.” Recently, it’s been hard to know what to do – and how hard to go – with gossip, but Barrett has some guidelines. “There are three things you need to consider when it comes to gossiping IRL: who’s it about; who told you (and are you allowed to relay it); and how far you want to go when it comes to the details – as in, how will it affect them? The perfect piece of gossip won’t damage someone’s relationship, say, but will be entertaining enough to keep you chatting for an entire round of drinks.” Gossiping about friends can be a bit of a minefield, she says: “Some people don’t want to do it, and others can’t be trusted not to feed back as soon as they get on the bus home” – but that’s why celebrities still play such a vital role in society. “Love Island unites us all every summer for good reason: we love talking shit about people we think we know inside and out.” If you still don’t trust yourself to gossip properly about people you know, try having an opinion about, say, Julia Fox. We all more-or-less understand how Covid spreads, now. It’s in the air, right? It’s sort of … around? And that all that panicked hand-washing we did from March 2020 onwards was hygienic, sure, but not entirely effective. Has that made handshaking any less fraught? No. Despite my best efforts, shaking hands isn’t going to go away for ever, so it makes sense to relearn how to do it in a way that makes everyone involved feel secure. “Everyone is comfortable doing different things,” William Hanson, etiquette coach and co-host of the Help, I Sexted My Boss podcast, tells me. “I personally am fine with a handshake – we are more informed now about Covid, and people are not maybe quite as touch-phobic as they were at the start – but if you are not comfortable shaking hands, then I would say you need to be proactive in giving a contactless greeting.” This can be anything from an elbow bump or a namaste or a regal wave, but fundamentally, if you don’t want to do a handshake, you have to be first to fire. If you do? Old rules still apply. “Imagine you’re going into a fruit bowl, you’re going to squeeze a peach or nectarine to see if it’s ripe,” Hanson explains. “That’s the sort of strength you want to use.” Stone fruit season doesn’t really kick in until August, so you might just have to practise this one on actual hands. There was always something mildly embarrassing about eating on the go – “Yes, correct,” your meal deal seems to announce, “I, an adult person who is nominally in charge of myself and legally allowed to vote, mistimed my meals so badly that I have to eat a sandwich between the next three stops on the train” – but the additional hurdle of the mask, and the intricate dance you have to do to eat through it (unhook one side, bite, re-hook, chew; repeat), has made public consumption the refuge of the desperate. “There are two types of people in the world: those who feel seething rage when a stranger three seats away eats a samosa, and the rest of us who have better things to do,” says Justin Myers, who dissects this magazine’s blind date column every week on his Guyliner website. “If anything, I’d hope the pandemic might inspire scolds to give empathy a go: we all get hungry; we’re all short on time; it might be someone’s only chance of a seat all day. Respect the commitment of someone chewing a tuna mayo baguette behind a surgical mask – the resulting trapped cloud of bad breath will far outlast your mild inconvenience.” For some people, small talk is an effortless social tool that helps warm up the cold gap between two people when left alone abruptly at a party, or makes the time go faster when for some reason your card is taking ages to be accepted at the till (“There’s money on it, mate! Ha, ha, ha!”). For others (me) it is not, and they have to make a deliberate effort to get small talk going, something that’s become harder and harder without practice. It’s been a good run, but abruptly asking, “Did you get Covid, then?” to people you haven’t seen for 18 months is no longer a cool small talk starter. (One of my party go-tos – “Have you ever seen anyone break a bone?” – remains effective, though.) The key to small talk is the same now as it was when you were also hopeless at it, pre-March 2020: ask questions, ideally open-ended ones, but don’t pepper them in as if you’re trying to figure out their mother’s maiden name, their national insurance number, and the street they grew up on. If you’re really stuck, try, “What incident led to you having to have a ‘special assembly’ at your school?” Nobody in this country can resist answering that question. I have found that, with my rusted-up social skills, I have had to apologise fairly often since the world reopened. But though the frequency of apologising has changed, the fundamentals remain the same. That is, saying “Sorry you were offended” or just, “Soz” doesn’t quite cut it. In 2012, Prof Beth Polin of the Eastern Kentucky University co-authored a paper called The Art of the Apology, which specified that a good apology includes at least one of the following six components: 1. An expression of regret (the actual “I’m sorry” bit); 2. An explanation (but, importantly, not a justification); 3. An acknowledgment of responsibility; 4. A declaration of repentance; 5. An offer of repair; and 6. A request for forgiveness. Sadly, the glowering feeling of “being a toddler forced to apologise because you have frightfully misbehaved” never really goes away. Etiquette expert Hanson is reassuringly outraged by my negroni story, but responds with an idea of how to respond next time this happens with something so gloriously passively aggressive that it makes me feel as if he’s walked over and slapped me sharply – but not unlovingly! – in the face. “If we were out and I said, ‘Oh, my gin and tonic’s delicious,’ and you said, ‘Oh, can I have a sip?’ I would say, ‘Of course – let me order you one,’ and beckon the waiter over as nicely as I could.” Myers is slightly less elegantly vicious, but still enforces boundaries. “Sharing food can be a bonding experience – an opportunity to explore the farthest reaches of a menu together, especially with tapas or meze – but Covid has exposed our previous cleanliness hypocrisy. We’d demand five-star hygiene ratings from restaurants, but then spend the entire meal sticking unwashed hands into each other’s dinner.” If you want a nibble of someone else’s plate, “you should wait to be asked”, but do think how much you actually want to try their pasta. “Consider a fork in your pie or a bite of your burger to be their tongue in your mouth,” Myers says. “If you’re unwilling to accept their saliva, everybody’s mouths and hands need to stay on their own side of the table.” Flirting is fun, isn’t it – adding a flicker of electricity to what is often a normal, even banal conversation (“No way one of your top three biscuits is a digestive, sorry! No!”) – but it’s been hard to do in the last two years. First, when it was basically illegal to touch people’s arms in a significant way, and second, since we’ve all been released, there’s been a feral edge to it. “Historically, flirting felt fun and pleasantly aimless, a sport that prioritised taking part over the podium,” Myers laments. “Now, after so much time lost, people are reluctant to waste it; if they don’t feel an instant connection, they scoot on, in search of someone to tick their boxes.” Annie Lord, a dating columnist for Vogue and contributor to the Guardian, treats flirting like a contact sport. “Touch works as well – obviously after you’ve assessed they’d be comfortable with that,” she says. “But like a little shove when they make an annoying joke or nudging them when you’re both leaning at the bar waiting for drinks, it warms things up.” Another thing worth bringing back is “looking at people”, something that feels especially intense in a post-mask world. “The sort of thing that works on me is intense eye contact,” Lord says. “It makes me go all shy and giggly, and I start playing with my hair. It feels as if they’re seeing who you really are. It makes you feel special. Since the pandemic, I’ve felt this even more because we went for such long periods without anyone looking at us, without being noticed.” People acting bizarrely on public transport is a cherished tradition in this country, and something I think we lost sight of during the first few lockdowns. Recently, I was on a bus that turned its engine off because a woman was shouting at the driver so much, and I was oddly soothed by the interruption: it felt like normality again. Public transport is a place where people can be their most authentic selves, so I am loth to enforce any particular rules over it, but it’s worth using this space to remind people to wear masks if the service demands it and – because I can’t believe how often this happens, still – have your payment method ready before you set foot on the bus or towards the barrier. How do some of you not know this yet? How? All of that said: is it still OK to be anxious about the outside world? After absorbing months and months of messaging saying that it’s a place that can hurt you: yes, a bit. I, for one, have been guilty of using, “Sorry mate, can’t: pandemic” as an excuse not to go to things I didn’t want to go to anyway, and it’s still a fairly useful get-out, but – as with a lot of these new social rules – playing it by ear and leaning into what you’re comfortable with is key. If there’s a new variant doing the rounds, feel free to welch on dinner. If there’s a mask-less bowling party happening and you don’t feel great about putting your fingers in there, don’t. And if someone tries to drink your negroni, then pull it away from them. They’ll look like fools, not you. We’re still feeling out what society looks like in a post-vaccine world, but saying, “No thanks – not for me!” is still a fairly vital part of it.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"So, can I eat on the bus again?

2/18/2022,"Greek rescue forces are desperately trying to save two people trapped onboard a stricken ferry amid fears that 14 passengers were missing nearly eight hours after the ship burst into flames. A Super Puma helicopter had attempted several times to approach the Euroferry Olympia, an Italian liner en route to Brindisi, when the fire broke out at around 4am. State-run TV described the pair – a Bulgarian and a Turk – as lorry drivers trapped in the ship’s garage.  “Efforts are being made to lead them to the deck,” a Greek coastguard official told reporters, adding that the helicopter was waiting to airlift them away. Four lifeboats carrying an estimated 279 people had meanwhile headed for the Ionian island of Corfu, where authorities were hoping to match arrivals with the passenger list assembled by crew. “There are unconfirmed reports of missing people although the Italian captain of the ship claims everyone has disembarked,” Stefanos Ghikas, a local MP, was quoted as saying by the news outlet Protothema.gr. When asked about the prospect of missing passengers, a spokesman at the Greek shipping ministry overseeing the rescue operation told the Guardian nothing could be ruled out. By midday, Hellenic navy ships, and at least three coastguard vessels, were participating in the rescue operation. “We still don’t have a clear picture and until everyone is counted and identified we won’t have one,” Giorgos Skordilis, the spokesman, said. The 183-metre Grimaldi Lines ferry had set sail from Greece’s western port of Igoumenitsa with 239 passengers, and 51 crew, onboard. Most of the passengers were believed to be Italian. The Greek shipping ministry said 25 vehicles and 153 trucks were also registered on the vessel. The fire, whose cause remains unknown, broke out about two hours after the ship left port, 10 miles north of Corfu, with residents on the island reportedly hearing explosions before large plumes of smoke were seen engulfing the vessel. Paul Kyprianou, a spokesman with Grimaldi Lines, said there were indications the fire started in the ship’s hold. “Damage is severe because despite their efforts the crew was unable to extinguish the fire,” he told Reuters. In a statement, the company said the blaze had erupted at 4.12am on a third-level car deck. “The ship’s crew immediately intervened to fight the flames. For the safety of passengers, the captain decided to abandon the ship … The Grimaldi group wishes to express its deep regret for the incident and will offer full cooperation to the authorities to shed light on the cause of the fire.” An Italian finance police boat, which happened to be in the area, was credited with playing a seminal role in the rescue operation with the country’s president, Sergio Mattarella, calling the finance unit’s commander personally to thank him. Describing the dramatic moments when passengers were told to evacuate as flames licked the sides of the ferry, the finance police vessel’s captain, Simone Cicchetti, told the Italian news agency Ansa: “When the fire broke out, the ship’s commander went around the cabins and brought the passengers together on a single desk. Then he gave the order to abandon ship, but the evacuation wasn’t a stroll in the park.” Speaking to the newspaper La Repubblica, he added: “A blaze onboard is a terrible experience.”",News/World news,Passengers feared missing after hundreds rescued from ferry blaze in Greece,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/18/fire-ferry-greece-italy-euroferry-olympia-288-people-on-board
2/18/2022,"PAI Capital was under the impression it was heading in the right direction. The private equity firm had heard that David Sullivan wanted out of West Ham and, after having an opening offer of £300m for the club turned down in November 2020, it was busy preparing its next move. There was reason for cautious optimism. PAI, founded by the Azerbaijani businessman Nasib Piriyev, had been invited for talks at Sullivan’s Essex mansion before making its first bid and had gone away feeling positive. There were discussions about figures, about life at the London Stadium and the overriding sense from the bidders was that a deal was there to be done with West Ham’s majority shareholder, who has experienced plenty of ups and downs since buying the club with David Gold in January 2010.  Yet it is not easy purchasing a football club. PAI returned with a £400m offer last February but Sullivan had become less welcoming. The 72-year-old would dismiss PAI as “property people” when its interest became public last summer and, in any case, he had caught them off guard by privately telling them he had given exclusivity to a Czech billionaire. Enter Daniel Kretinsky, swooping in just as PAI was pondering where to go next last October. His deal was approaching the final stages when news of his interest in purchasing a significant stake broke a day after West Ham had knocked Manchester City out of the Carabao Cup. Negotiations with Kretinsky were smooth and there was a new voice at the table after the 46-year-old became the second-largest shareholder by purchasing a 27% stake last November. Three months on, the question is what comes next. West Ham are battling for fourth place, could win the Europa League and are on the rise under the shrewd management of David Moyes. The controversy over Kurt Zouma kicking his cat has been an unwanted distraction but they go into Saturday’s game at home to Saudi-led Newcastle full of optimism. It is a far cry from the days when supporters bristled about the move to the London Stadium and accused Gold, Sullivan and Karren Brady, the vice-chair, of broken promises about investment in the team. Yet breaking the Premier League’s glass ceiling is far from straightforward. Championship League qualification is up for grabs, but West Ham do not have as much depth as Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham, and must now also consider Wolves as contenders. Moyes’s squad is light and West Ham spent January trying to strengthen, with a striker and centre-back their priorities. It was a trying window. With clubs reluctant to sell, West Ham grasped for solutions. Club-record bids for Benfica’s Darwin Núñez and Leeds United’s Kalvin Phillips and Raphinha were turned down. Frustration mounted when the deadline passed without anyone coming in and, although Moyes is famously picky, the attention usually falls on one figure when West Ham struggle to make signings: Sullivan. Yet although Sullivan, himself a billionaire, remains the most powerful figure at the club, it is no longer just about him. Kretinsky has altered the landscape. He should increase their spending power and his arrival could ultimately spell the end of the Sullivan and Gold era. According to documents submitted to Companies House last November, Kretinsky has an option for a full takeover. The papers revealed that there is a put and call agreement between Sullivan, 1890 holdings a.s, the holding company used by Kretinsky to buy his shares, and EP Investment Sarl, Kretinsky’s investment company. The deal gave Sullivan the right to sell his shares to Kretinsky at a set price, and Kretinsky has the option to buy Sullivan’s shares. The price cannot change and other shareholders can be included in the deal under the same terms, though the option exists only for a certain time. There is no guarantee Kretinsky will increase his stake. Kretinsky, who also co-owns Sparta Prague, could decide to hold back. He has not taken full control of Sparta since buying a 40% stake in 2004. Kretinsky is known as the “Czech Sphinx” because of his inscrutable business style and his intentions remain unknown. Kretinsky declined to comment. “We have come to support the club but – so as to manage supporters’ expectations – that doesn’t mean big spending in the January transfer window,” he wrote in the Evening Standard in November. “Gradual evolution is, in my opinion, the most healthy way to build a strong club.” The message was about patience and tallies with Moyes’s approach. West Ham were in a relegation battle two seasons ago. Their rise was unexpected. Gold and Sullivan have fought many fires since buying the club – relegation in 2011, leaving Upton Park in 2016, protests at the London Stadium – and one theory is that they would be able to leave with their heads high if they sold with the team on the up. Club insiders, though, have repeatedly insisted that Kretinsky’s arrival will not automatically lead to Gold and Sullivan leaving. Sullivan has become less involved in recruitment in recent years, but he loves working in football and it is understood that he will look to buy a smaller club if he sells West Ham. The feeling is that he does not intend to leave, though there are no guarantees that will remain the case. Kretinsky, a qualified lawyer who has a number of other investments, including stakes in Royal Mail, Sainsbury’s and France’s Le Monde newspaper, is not the only person who has shown an interest in buying West Ham. Reports of bids have captured the fanbase’s imagination in the past. The relationship between the board and supporters plummeted after West Ham toiled after moving to Stratford and campaigns to force out Sullivan and Gold grew at the start of 2020, protests before home games against Everton and Southampton laying bare the unrest. At that stage, with the pandemic yet to force football behind closed doors, it seemed that West Ham were a broken club. Sullivan was downbeat. Supporters were constantly on the verge of erupting and although Moyes led his side to safety during Project Restart, the start to the 2020-21 season brought more discontent when Grady Diangana was sold to West Brom. The heat was on after the departure of Diangana, a popular academy player, and it was not long before news emerged of a US consortium having bids of £350m and £400m turned down. The asking price, Sullivan said, was much higher. Yet others were interested and PAI explored the possibility of buying the club. Piriyev, who supports West Ham, had began to put plans together with his business partners. Part of the discussions centred on the London Stadium, which West Ham rent from the London Legacy Development Corporation for £3m a year. PAI felt that the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park was underutilised and a burden on taxpayers, so it decided that one of the key facets to its bid would be trying to taking control of the stadium. That part of the plan would lead to Sullivan’s “property people” jibe. After a while he came to feel that PAI’s proposals lacked credibility. Initially, though, discussions between the two parties were productive. When Sullivan invited PAI to his home, according to sources he said that he knew his time at the club could be up and that supporters would love anyone who bought the stadium. PAI’s representatives left feeling “buoyed up”. Sullivan had said his valuation of the club tended to rise and fall based on how well West Ham were playing, but PAI was under the impression that £450m would be enough. On 25 November, PAI’s first offer came in: £300m. Sullivan dismissed it as “almost laughable”. By then, West Ham were starting to motor on the pitch. Moyes had transformed the team, who were driven on by Declan Rice in midfield, and European football suddenly felt a realistic target. PAI, though, was undeterred. In December 2020 Andy Mollett, the club’s chief finance officer, gave access to West Ham’s data room. PAI was able to examine the finances and returned with a £400m offer two months later. Sullivan would publicly describe it as “derisory”. By then PAI had unwittingly entered into a PR war. It announced that the former West Ham players Tony Cottee, Rio Ferdinand and Anton Ferdinand were on board but the communication around the bid came to feel naive. Supporters grew suspicious and, in any case, Kretinsky was talking to the club in secret. The process with Kretinsky was smoother. Sullivan has always been open to investors coming on board. PAI did not want him to remain as the majority shareholder, because its influence would have been diluted, but Kretinsky has taken a more pragmatic approach. Talks between Sullivan and the Czech took place in secret and lasted about nine months. He attended West Ham’s 4-1 win over Leicester last August and was welcomed into the fold after agreeing a deal worth about £180m-£200m. The deal, believed to value West Ham at £700m, saw Kretinsky and his colleague Pavel Horsky appointed to the board. It reduced Sullivan’s shareholding from 51.5% to 38.8%, Gold’s by 10% to 25.1% and Tripp Smith’s by 2% to 8%, with the number of shares in the hands of other investors falling from 3.4% to 1.1%. But what comes next? Gold, 85, has become less involved. Sullivan has spoken about letting his sons, Jack and Dave Jr, take charge. Nothing is off the table and any prospect of a full takeover by Kretinsky is complicated by the anti-embarrassment clause in the rental agreement for the London Stadium, which states that Sullivan and Gold have to pay a 20% penalty to the taxpayer if the club is sold for more than £300m before March 2023. Perhaps Sullivan and Gold will leave as soon as that clause no longer applies. The LLDC has written to West Ham to ask whether the payment is already due after new shares were issued following Kretinsky’s investment. The LLDC wants to see the details of the deal. West Ham declined to comment. It is another complication, particularly as the relationship between West Ham and the LLDC has not always been easy. It has improved in recent years – the stadium’s capacity has risen to 62,000 and the squaring off of the stands behind the goal has made it look less like an athletics venue – but West Ham were intrigued when PAI announced it had reached a provisional agreement with the LLDC to take over the running of the stadium last August. West Ham had assumed they would be approached first were the stadium to change hands. Five and a half years after moving in, the stadium still poses challenges. For the LLDC, there is value in being able to host concerts and Major League Baseball matches, and there is a concession agreement with UK Athletics to consider. Its supporters argue that it brings a spotlight to London and point out that the Olympic legacy has helped to regenerate east London. Yet the stadium runs at a loss, with the public purse propping it up. The naming rights remain unsold and there is a question about what works best for taxpayers. There have been suggestions that West Ham will look into taking control of the stadium. The LLDC is open to all options, whether selling the stadium or renegotiating the terms of West Ham’s lease, although both parties insist nothing is imminent. There is no sense of urgency. The lease is generous for West Ham and they are starting to enjoy themselves in Stratford. Moyes has brought stability and the appointment of Rob Newman as head of recruitment is a positive step. Newman, who was highly respected at Manchester City, works closely with Moyes and has focused on improving the scouting set-up. Yet West Ham, who could struggle to keep Rice if they finish outside the top four, have a long way to go. Money talks loudest at the highest level. Sullivan and Gold know how hard it is to break the established order. Eventually they could ask themselves whether it is worth the hassle. They stand to make a huge profit on their investment if they walk away and, with Kretinsky on board, West Ham could be about to open a new chapter.",Sport/Football,"Special report: with a new billionaire on board, what next for West Ham?",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/18/west-ham-what-next-with-new-billionaire-daniel-kretinsky
2/18/2022,"Hervé Mombo Kinga, the pro-democracy activist and celebrated blogger who spent 17 months in jail for insulting the Gabonese president, Ali Bongo Ondimba, was not impressed when he saw the pictures of the leader limping up the stairs of France’s presidential palace. Kinga, who died last week at 47 after contracting Covid, was infuriated by the episode – widely shared in the west African country of Gabon, despite the embarrassment it caused the president, whose family has held power for more than five decades.  Using a walking stick and supported by an aide, Bongo lost his balance at the top of the Élysée stairs. He was caught by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. In a six-minute video on social media, Kinga fumed at Macron for what he saw as the French leader’s endorsement of Bongo, whose disputed re-election in 2016 by a slim margin was marked by violence. “Emmanuel Macron, we are effectively at war,” said Kinga, angry about the mending of relations between his homeland and its former colonial ruler. Kinga was a vociferous critic of the Bongo regime, posting videos under the pseudonym “Matricule 001” or resistance soldier 001. Kinga’s health had deteriorated after the harsh conditions of his detention, according to his lawyer, Anges Kevin Nzigou. He was hospitalised in January and contracted Covid, which “became more severe, particularly because of his state of health”, Nzigou says. Kinga had just become a father for the second time. “Mr Kinga was an unwavering defender of human rights in Gabon and led his fight without hatred or resentment, despite the obstacles he faced. It is this [that] made him an emblematic figure in the fight for freedoms in Gabon,” Nzigou says. Kinga had been left penniless after the authorities destroyed his business, a cybercafe in the capital Libreville, and could not afford healthcare. A crowdfunding campaign was launched to help, but the intervention came too late. Céline Assaf Boustani, president of the Human Rights Foundation (HRF), says: “Armed with just a camera, Hervé dedicated his life to exposing the harsh reality of life under the Bongo regime in Gabon. “Hervé was insightful and courageous, and his death is a tremendous loss to the Gabonese people struggling against poverty and government repression.” Gabonese opposition leader Jean Ping was among those who paid tribute online. He hailed “the courageous fight he led for Gabon”. Others called Kinga a “freedom fighter” whose death was a “big loss” for young people. “Sick, weakened, continually persecuted, he refused to leave Gabon. A righteous man died today,” said one tweet. “Your death saddens us. But the seed you sowed in us has become a hope that nourishes and inspires us every day,” read another. Kinga started making videos in 2015, “criticising repression, injustices, poor public services and deleterious living conditions for ordinary Gabonese citizens under dictator Ali Bongo’s regime”, says the HRF. He supported Jean Ping in 2016. Dozens of people lost their lives in the post-election violence. Omar Bongo, the current president’s father, governed from 1967 until his death in 2009, when his son took over after a contested election. Kinga was among more than a dozen activists arrested in demonstrations in August 2017, a year after the election. He was held for 17 months, partially in solitary confinement, and charged with “insulting the head of state” and “participating in propaganda that disturbs the public order”. “He was kept with very limited light and air coming from a small opening in the ceiling, making it impossible to ascertain whether it was day or night. Through this opening, rather than through the door, Kinga received his minimal food ration. Although detainees are usually allowed three meals per day, Kinga was only given food once per day,” according to a 2019 HRF petition submitted to the UN, appealing Kinga’s imprisonment. “This food ration was thrown over the wall to him, as if he were an animal. He was unable to shower and lacked access to any toilet facilities; instead, he was forced to relieve himself in a plastic bag in his cell. Kinga was not provided [with] a mattress and was relegated to sleeping on the floor, although he could not properly lie down in the painfully small cell.” Released in February 2019, Kinga was particularly critical of the government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. In his last video posted, Kinga said: “If you think about it, we are armed: we have words, resistance, boycotting, and disobedience. I will be the first to encourage this type of fight.”",News/Global development,‘Insightful and courageous’: Gabon activist Hervé Mombo Kinga dies of Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/18/insightful-and-courageous-gabon-activist-herve-mombo-kinga-dies-of-covid

2/18/2022,"Following his remarkable performance in the TV adaptation of Edward St Aubyn’s autobiographical series Patrick Melrose, it feels fitting that Benedict Cumberbatch should provide the narration for the author’s 10th novel. Double Blind follows a group of thirtysomething professionals, all dedicated in different ways to the advancement of ideas; among them is Francis, a botanist overseeing the rewilding of a country estate in Sussex, and his new girlfriend, Olivia, a biologist with a keen interest in epigenetics. There’s also Olivia’s best friend, Lucy, whom we meet boarding a plane from America to run a new venture capital firm, and who has just rejected a marriage proposal from her mega-rich boyfriend; and Lucy’s new employer, Hunter, a tech entrepreneur and hedge fund billionaire who owns a ranch called Apocalypse Now. Meanwhile, Olivia’s psychotherapist father, Martin, is treating a man with schizophrenia who has a secret connection to the family. Cumberbatch glides smoothly between these intertwined narratives, breathing life into the characters and revelling in the flashes of caustic wit. He also makes impressively light work of the protagonists’ rambling interior monologues on such subjects as immunology, ecology, bioethics and neuroscience; these passages can be stodgy on the page but are more digestible in audio. Deploying various accents and voices, the actor also has fun with St Aubyn’s peripheral figures, from the comically sinister Vatican priest trying to pull off an outlandish business deal to Hunter’s cocaine-addled sidekick Saul who “had always spoken rapidly but on that [day] he was sprinting to the next full stop like an athlete trying to break a record”.

2/18/2022," In this Booker-nominated fable, a robot stands in a shop window waiting for a human family to claim her. Klara is an Artificial Friend, or AF, who runs on solar power and has been created as a companion for lonely children – her role is part sibling, part childminder. Klara has a rare aptitude among AFs for observing human emotions, and learns to read sadness, anger and joy in the faces of the people she sees in the street. Watching what appears to be a reunion of two friends, she remarks to the shop manager: “They seem so happy … But it’s strange because they also seem upset.”  Klara, who is the narrator of Ishiguro’s eighth novel, is spotted by a 14-year-old girl, Josie, who brings her mother to the shop and begs to buy her. Once installed in the family home, Klara learns that Josie is chronically ill with a sickness that killed her sister, and that her role will require considerably more than companionship. New York voice actor Sura Siu adopts a convincingly subdued tone to convey Klara’s android status. The language, and Siu’s reading of it, is spare and childlike, poignantly capturing Klara’s instinctive goodness and desire for connection. The book shares themes with the author’s 2005 novel Never Let Me Go: both have a vision of a future that feels uncomfortably close to the present, and both feature an artificially created protagonist who, in Klara’s case, is more human than the flesh-and-blood individuals she was created to serve.

2/18/2022,"The Plimsoll is a pub down a side road in Finsbury Park, north London, doing an ebullient trade serving burgers and more, that knows exactly what it is. It is not remotely a gastropub. It isn’t a shiny-floored, exorcised former boozer with its heart dragged out, replaced with heavily styled guinea fowl on white china and gelato of the day, Noble Isle hand soap, piles of neatly folded Egyptian cotton hand towels and a soothing George Ezra compilation floating into the private dining room. There are hundreds of pubs like this across Britain and although they’re very handy for anyone wanting a “civilised” meal with “the guys”, I’m not sure these same diners would appreciate the Plimsoll. Or understand why tables in this not-gastropub are currently like gold dust, meaning they’d most likely settle for a table for two at 9.15pm sometime midweek, late March, only to find the menu is scallop bhuna fried pizza, or liver with colcannon, served on your great-gran’s best yet mismatched crockery, in a rather dark, brazenly “pubby” old pub, heaving with the ghosts of its past as an old-school drinking den, but now with Sonic Youth blaring out. Or they might turn up on a weekend or an Arsenal match day, to find there’s a very limited menu. At this point, some customers may become livid and bewildered, the two main emotions behind almost all Yelp.com restaurant reviews. Why would I send people there who’d be irked by what it isn’t? Especially as I do not want the table shortage to become sillier.  There was a point when a large slice of freshly made ricotta cheesecake – firm, New York-Italian style, slightly salty, compelling and served with a tiny ramekin of rhubarb – arrived and, as I picked up a spoon, Kate Bush’s Running Up That Hill began to play. It was the most undiluted, multi-sensory, unadulterated fun I have had since 2020. The Plimsoll is now in the hands of chefs Jamie Allan and Ed McIlroy, who, before this project, ran a well-loved semi-permanent pop-up called Four Legs at the Compton Arms in north London. Here, the pair became food-scene-famous for serving a very good Dexter cheeseburger – a glossy, slightly sloppy, cheesy, gherkin-blessed but certainly not salad-spoiled burger. It takes a lot to impress the food scene with a burger these days, but Allan and Mcllroy did, as well as with bowls of soft, deep-fried salad potatoes with fresh aioli, plates of almost blackened pork chipolatas, mince and tatties and then delicate plates of scallop escabeche, or a luxurious Middlesborough-style parmo (chicken parmigiana) laden with cheese. All this nostalgia, simplicity and brazen oddness would be a catastrophe if the pair couldn’t cook: it works because they are brilliant. Allan is formerly of Hill & Szrok in Broadway market and McIlroy was at the well-respected Bao; over two years at the Compton Arms they have honed a skill for pleasing the hungry. There’s a quiet finesse in their work that is streets ahead of pub food; so within this mismatched, single-sheet menu – which changes daily – expect a humble bowl of crisps served with a slick, pink pool of fresh cod’s roe. Or a plate of breaded, deep-fried herring perched on rough-cut baguette with a precise watercress mayo. We ordered slip sole with shittake, not quite expecting to receive the whole fish served with a buttery, earthy sauce rich with ’shroom and sweet rhubarb. The Plimsoll pulls you from St John to Ynyshir to Saturday lunch at Pearl Beach in Saint Tropez, yet somehow you’re in the Queen Vic and it’s being cooked by men who resemble members of the early 70s, Rod Stewart-era band Faces. Service is incredibly good, prompt and knowledgable, which lifts the whole experience from pub to something beyond. But this all said, tables are tight, so expect to be there for a good time, but not a long time. If I’d had longer, I’d have lingered over a plate of aged comte, a bowl of the whiskey pudding and perhaps another bowl of the spuds and fancy garlic mayo. However it was Wednesday, the Plimsoll was mobbed and they wanted my 5.30pm table back. I have to respect any restaurant that kicks me out – pen in hand, daft dangly earrings jangling as I finish my cheesecake – as they already have enough customers. No three-hour tasting menus and “would you like a tour of the kitchens?” for the men from Four Legs. They’re full and don’t need my feedback and I love it. Four Legs at The Plimsoll 52 St Thomas’s Road, London N4; (no phone). Open Mon-Fri 3-11pm, Sat & Sun noon-midnight.

2/18/2022,"The Goodbye Coast by Joe Ide (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, £16.99)Joe Ide’s first series featured the Sherlock Holmes-like Isaiah Quintabe. Now comes a contemporary reimagining of Raymond Chandler’s private eye, Philip Marlowe. Ide’s creation shares a name, a job description and a location with his literary progenitor, but has a deal more backstory – including a failed police career and a complicated relationship with his LAPD veteran father – and a deal less alcohol (although Dad makes up for that). When obnoxious film star Kendra Jones hires him, he assumes it’s to solve the murder of her director husband, shot dead some weeks earlier on the beach in Malibu, but she wants him to find and return her 17-year-old stepdaughter. Cody, who believes that Kendra had her father killed, refuses to come home; the truth, of course, is far less straightforward and a lot more dangerous. To complicate matters further, Marlowe falls for a desperate mother whose young son has been kidnapped by his father … The shift away from Chandler’s tight first-person focus risks diluting the whole, but The Goodbye Coast is a terrific read – pacy, with tension, pathos, wonderful descriptions of LA and some lovely one-liners.  Even the Darkest Night by Javier Cercas, translated by Anne McLean (MacLehose, £16.99)Award-winning Spanish author Cercas turns his hand to crime fiction in a mystery with its roots in the civil war. Even the Darkest Night is the first in what promises to be an excellent series, featuring Melchor Marín, a criminal who, inspired by a desire to discover who killed his mother, joins the police force by dint of hard graft and doctored paperwork. To escape the glare of publicity after foiling a terrorist attack in Barcelona, he is relocated to the Catalan backwater of Terra Alta where, four years later, the police department finds itself in the media spotlight after a local businessman and his wife are tortured to death. Sections alternate between past and present – the backstory here does a lot of heavy lifting – as Marín, thwarted in his attempts to solve the case, redoubles his efforts with tragic consequences. History casts a long shadow over this tale of political and personal loyalties and the various means by which justice – of a kind – may be achieved. Notes on an Execution by Danya Kukafka (Phoenix, £16.99)In the introductory note to her second novel, Kukafka makes the point that “average men become interesting when they start hurting women” – our fascination with serial killers such as Ted Bundy allows these men to steal not only their female victims’ lives but their narratives, and causes us to overlook what is lost to family and community when women are murdered. A fictional attempt to remedy this, Notes on an Execution is a masterful slow burn of a novel. The narrative of the killer, an inadequate individual who has made bad choices and is hours away from death by lethal injection in a Texas prison, is rendered in the second person, with a level of success that is vanishingly rare. His tale is balanced by the stories of his mother, his former sister-in-law, and the female detective who succeeds in catching him: a poignant, beautifully written and necessarily uncomfortable read. The House of Ashes by Stuart Neville (Zaffre, £14.99)More uber-toxic masculinity here, this time in rural Northern Ireland. Neville’s latest is a grim tale of abuse past and present, split between the former inhabitants of the titular farmhouse – a brutal father and two sons (“the Daddies”) who keep women (“the Mummies”) captive and cowed – and the current occupants. Ex-social worker Sara, whose world, policed by controlling husband Damien, is shrinking by the day, has started to see bloodstains on the kitchen flagstones; then elderly, dishevelled Mary Jackson appears at the door, claiming the house is hers and asking about missing children. Chapters alternate between Mary’s nightmarish upbringing – the “missing children” are the ghosts of those who did not survive the cruelty and neglect – and Sara’s attempts to escape her increasingly trammelled existence. Eventually, their fledgling friendship, beautifully drawn, offers each woman a glimmer of hope. Whatever Gets You Through the Night by Charlie Higson (Little, Brown, £14.99)Rather more upbeat, and with far better weather, is Charlie Higson’s return to crime fiction for grownups. Robert McIntyre (not his real name) has come to Corfu in order to rescue 15-year-old Lauren from a paedophile who operates under the cover of an elite tennis training programme that is perilously close to a cult, but it’s not easy. Lauren’s dad has arrived on the island and keeps getting in the way; the kid is busy cooking up her own escape attempt; and other impediments include a drug dealers’ turf war, Albanian gangsters, a psychotic bodyguard and a bunch of rich teenage brats out for kicks. It’s loud, bright, fast and funny – a perfect read for a dreary month.

2/18/2022,"It won’t prevent cancer, rejuvenate ageing skin or arrest global warming but coleslaw is nonetheless a “miracle food”. Crunchy and wet, creamy and fresh, sweet and savoury, the subject of this month’s How to eat – the series identifying how best to enjoy Britain’s favourite foods – delivers rare complexity in every mouthful. It is also one of the few salads that works with hot dishes, the mayonnaise greasing the wheels of that gastronomic interaction. Little wonder that Dutch koolsla, originally a way of dressing raw cabbage to make it palatable, not only survived its 18th-century journey to the US but with adjustments (swapping vinaigrette for mayonnaise), was re-exported to global acclaim.  It is the American, mayo-based variety of coleslaw that HTE will focus on here. Not because it is better than its drier, oil-dressed or fat-free cousins that flourish everywhere from El Salvador to Russia, but because, were HTE to delve into all those variations and unpack the explosion in “Asian inspired” slaws, this entry would make War and Peace look like a pamphlet. So what should US-style coleslaw consist of? How is it best deployed? And what should the prison sentence be if you add pineapple to it? HTE is here to adjudicate. Coleslaw presents an established formula for perfection which, at the same time, allows a degree of responsible self-expression. Yet frequently we ruin it. After combining cabbage and mayo, you are free to improvise within rational boundaries – boundaries that the world repeatedly oversteps. In coleslaw as in life, an irrational desire to assert creative agency trumps all. You know putting pomegranate, bacon or broccoli stalks in coleslaw is a terrible idea, but you do it anyway. A similar instinct encourages people to give coleslaw a coronation chicken makeover (curry powder, raisins), insert strident acidic notes (capers, gherkins, jalapeños) and, most egregiously of all, fold in fruit and texturally jarring nuts. It is possible to successfully combine apple and fennel, or beetroot, carrot and blood orange – but in a salad. Not shredded into coleslaw. Binding such ingredients together in mayonnaise sets you on the road to disaster. Similarly, there is no place in coleslaw for: grated cheese (a gummy presence in what should be coleslaw’s cleanly interlocking cogs); radishes or fennel (too assertive, will hog the limelight); celeriac (you are not making remoulade); or cucumber, tomatoes and bell peppers (this is not an opportunity to clear out the soggy, festering bottom of the salad drawer). Meanwhile, raw broccoli, cauliflower and sprouts bring a certain worthy, leathery, cattle-feed quality to a dish that should land with a sparkling zing. Note: coleslaw must not be drowned in mayonnaise. This is not mayonnaise soup. Pre-packaged versions in which thin, sad strands of carrot and onion swim hidden in sweet gloop are depressing and illogical. Mayonnaise is the more expensive ingredient. Using vinegar to further season the coleslaw is at best ill-advised and regularly a calamity. See also: coleslaws sweetened (vandalised) with honey or given over to a domineering blue cheese dressing. There is a school of thought that coleslaw is not coleslaw without cabbage. That is correct. It started life as a cabbage dish. More importantly, without that cabbage (green preferably, red acceptable), coleslaw lacks much of the crunch, thickness and mineral tang that makeas it so refreshing and physically satisfying. Into a shredded mound of that base ingredient – shred everything*, no dicing – add red onion and carrot (both essential), and a little celery if the mood takes you. Feel free to loosen the mayo with sour cream or yoghurt to freshen it. If you like a subtle sheen of heat (heat that platforms fellow ingredients rather than shouting over them), add a dab of mustard or a little finely chopped red chilli. Remember to season, season and season again. *Possessed of some misguided puritanical zeal, coleslaw’s militant wing insist this must be done by hand. In fact, prepping coleslaw is one of the best uses for a food processor. As well as that creamy lubrication, coleslaw provides crunch and fresh flavours that are a source of pleasure in themselves and a palate cleanser when eaten with moderately greasy foods. Where, for example, would bready Romana-style pizza, buttery jacket potatoes or barbecued meats be without coleslaw’s moist, multifunctional intervention? As the late restaurateur Wilber Shirley put it in Holy Smoke: The Big Book of North Carolina Barbecue: “I won’t even sell someone a barbecue unless they get coleslaw. If they want a barbecue and they don’t want coleslaw, there’s something wrong with that person. It all goes together.” There is a man who would appreciate how conveniently coleslaw drapes itself over a hotdog or, between mouthfuls of carbs, punctuates a plate of fries. Coleslaw is constantly shape-shifting, through its many dimensions of texture and flavour, to offer multiple points of inflection and cohesion in different environments. For example, in its fresh vitality it can add a reviving pep to a platter of cured meats or a burger – both dense with funky, savoury flavours – while, conversely, coleslaw’s vibrant flavours can lift an otherwise bland piece of leftover roast chicken or, in its vegetal spritz, both complement and offset lasagne. Though on the plate, lasagne’s cheese and coleslaw’s mayo may seem to have an utterly different outlook, they are momentarily united by their overlapping similarities (fat, basically). Coleslaw is also one of the great sandwich fillings. It is divine nestling atop ridged salt and vinegar crisps on sliced white bread (randomly moistening certain crisps but leaving others deliciously rigid), and will bring a crucial layer of texture, moisture and flavour to sandwiches as diverse as roast beef and tinned tuna. Without wishing to dazzle you with the glamorous details of HTE’s private life, it is a big fan of the 15-second hummus wrap. Take one packet wrap, warm it draped over the toaster, spread with hummus and a generous dollop of any leftover coleslaw you have lying around. It will drip everywhere, over fingers, wrists, plate, worktop, but it is nonetheless quick-turnaround, no-lunch-break food of the gods. You barely need to chew. As a loose, bendable rule (HTE must be mellowing in its old age), coleslaw works best as a foil to proteins and carbs. That protein may be fat-slicked in some way, the presence of fat forming a common bond between the protein and the coleslaw. But coleslaw works far less well in conjunction with overtly fatty and rich foods, where, instead of offering a lively, contrasting raw veg energy, its mayo seems to cohere with all the other fats on the plate to create a dead-weight implosion – a heavy slog of a meal, rather than an enthusiastic sprint. Quiche and coleslaw is a one-note case in point, as is omelette or frittata with slaw. A cheese pasty will, conspicuously, fail to achieve a light-stepping grace if you add coleslaw. This collision is most profound, however, with cheese itself. In a sandwich or on a cheeseboard, the two appear to be natural bedfellows, but – much like the effect of ice-cream on chocolate – coleslaw seems to inhibit cheese from breaking down in your mouth. Normally, cheddar almost melts into a fudgy consistency. But the temperature and lip-coating glossiness of coleslaw throws up an awkward, unyielding, cool-fatty barrier between you and the cheese. It sits in your mouth like a waxy lump. So, coleslaw: how do you eat yours?",Lifestyle/Food,How to eat: coleslaw,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/18/how-to-eat-coleslaw

2/18/2022,"One of the most eye-catching moments of this year’s Super Bowl – alongside the all-time classic half-time show and cutaway shots to the mind-bogglingly massive, intestine-shaped “infinity screen” pulsing away at LA’s SoFi Stadium – was the first glimpse of Amazon’s new Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power series. You may be aware of it, given it has been five years in the making and its first season cost a shade under the GDP of Tonga. Those who aren’t will surely be very soon, thanks to an exhaustive marketing blitz that will whirr for the next seven months until the show’s release.  The teaser trailer that launched at the Super Bowl was designed to be the centrepiece of this marketing campaign; a place in the most highly coveted advertising window on the planet, beamed into over 100m households in the US, as well as the rest of (Middle) Earth via YouTube. In terms of attracting eyeballs, Amazon’s gambit was a success: 257m people around the world watched the teaser in the first 24 hours after its release. Dig a little deeper though – or rather scroll down to the comments section of that YouTube video – and things look dramatically less rosy. There you’ll find variations on the same Tolkien quote, posted over and over again, in Russian and Czech, Portuguese and Polish: “Evil is unable to create anything new. It can only distort and destroy what has been invented or created by the forces of good”. This “comment bomb” is designed to drown out any praise or even general discussion, and seems to have done the trick: at the time of writing, 68,000 people have commented on the video and pretty much all of them are that same damning quote. (Until recently they would largely have expressed their disappointment through the ‘dislike’ button, but YouTube no longer reveals the number of people who engage with its thumbs-down feature publicly.) But just what are the commenters angry about? Amazon’s much-criticised labour practices, perhaps, or Jeff Bezos’ foray into billionaire space tourism? No, the complaints largely seem to be about the trailer itself: its gleaming CGI-ishness, changes to Tolkien’s original story, minor details to sigils, dwarves and the like and – most pointedly – the fact that it seems a pale imitation of Peter Jackson’s much loved (and still fairly recent in the memory) adaptation. Such fan revolts seem to have become the norm in recent years, with releases that fail to live up to viewers’ lofty expectations leading to high-profile backlash. We’ve seen calls to reshoot anticlimactic endings of massive TV franchises. We’ve seen users bombard Rotten Tomatoes with negative film reviews. And we’ve seen a couple of fan revolts prove successful, with Paramount re-designing Sonic the Hedgehog to make him look less like a “nightmarish experiment in avant garde taxidermy”, and Warner Bros releasing the glowering four-hour ‘Snyder cut’ of Justice League as a corrective to Joss Whedon’s widely loathed version of the film. Even so, this Lord of the Rings rebellion seems quite unprecedented. These fans – or at least a faction of them – seem to be rebelling against the entire product, something that feels far harder to correct than gussying up a misshapen hedgehog.

2/18/2022,"Storm Eunice has been forecast to be the worst storm to hit the UK for more than 30 years. Schools and businesses have been closed, and householders have been warned to batten down the hatches. But what happens if it damages your property?  Buildings insurance policies usually state that they will cover financial loss caused by storm damage – but companies have been known to argue over what constitutes a storm. Last year Guardian Money dealt with a case where an insurer refused to pay to repair a leaking roof damaged during Storm Christoph. The Financial Ombudsman Service says these type of disputes are among the main complaints it gets about unpaid storm damage claims. The Association of British Insurers says a storm is a period of violent weather defined as: Wind speeds with gusts of at least 48 knots (55mph) – equivalent to 10 on the Beaufort scale or; Torrential rainfall at a rate of at least 25mm an hour or; Snow to a depth of at least 1ft (30 cm) in 24 hours or; Hail of such intensity that it causes damage to hard surfaces or breaks glass. Your insurer may have this definition in its policy or may apply its own rules. If the weather in your area does not meet the criteria, it will turn down your claim. As soon as you can, you need to tell your insurer that your property has been damaged and you want to make a claim. Most insurers have 24-hour helplines and they should be geared up to deal with the fallout from the storm, as forecasters have been talking about it for days. Speak to the insurer before arranging urgent repairs or somewhere to stay. It may have emergency repair teams to send out but, if not, your policy may cover getting the work done. Tell your insurer that this work needs doing, and make sure you get receipts to submit as you may be able to get the money back from your policy. When it is safe to, inspect your property properly and make a list of all of the damage. Take photos and keep anything you can in case you need to show the insurer evidence to back up your claim. This will depend on your policy. If you have buildings cover, this will pay out for damage to your home – it will cover the cost of replacing items and getting things fixed. It is also likely to cover accommodation costs if you are unable to stay in your property because of the damage. How much it will pay out will depend on the level of cover you have bought, and what excess you chose – this is the sum you pay towards any work. What cover it offers for things such as garden sheds will depend on the individual policy. Your possessions will be covered by contents insurance. You may have included garden furniture and bikes on this policy – if you haven’t, then you won’t be able to claim if these are damaged. Contents cover often offers the option to protect everything in your freezer – if you bought this and have a power cut, remember to tot up and photograph everything you have to throw out. If your car is hit by a tree or debris blowing around, it will be covered if you have a comprehensive insurance policy – as most drivers do. A third-party policy will not cover storm damage. The insurer Zurich says during November’s Storm Arwen claims for this type of damage increased by 17%. However, it said storm-related claims were more often for crashes – during Arwen claims for road traffic accidents were up by 35%. So if you are leaving the house, drive carefully. If your neighbour’s car is damaged by tiles falling from your roof you may be liable – but they will have to show that you are at fault. If your roof was already in a bad state of repair they may be able to claim against you. The legal liability element of your home insurance should cover this.",Lifestyle/Money,Will your insurance cover Storm Eunice damage and how do you claim?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/18/will-your-insurance-cover-storm-eunice-damage-and-how-do-you-claim
2/18/2022,"Today in a nutshell: Norway set a record gold medal haul as the fallout from the way Kamila Valieva’s coaching team treated her continues Next up: There is bobsleigh, ice hockey and curling still to come today. On Saturday, Team GB will win their first medal of these Games – but will it be silver or gold?  Eileen Gu of China wrote a new chapter of Olympic history by soaring to a third medal at these Games. The 18-year-old won gold in the freeski halfpipe final, adding to her big air gold and slopestyle silver to complete an unprecedented hat-trick. Canada filled out the podium as the defending Olympic champion, Cassie Sharpe, won silver three points clear of teammate Rachael Karker. “It has been two straight weeks of the most intense highs and lows I’ve ever experienced in my life,” said Gu, who became the youngest person to win three individual medals in the history of the Winter Olympics. “It has changed my life forever.” In the men’s ski cross it was Switzerland who took two medals. Ryan Regez grabbed a lead early and never let go. Teammate Alex Fiva finished second and Sergey Ridzik of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) took bronze. Sean Ingle described yesterday’s figure skating final as chaotic and cruel. A tearful Kamila Valieva slipped to fourth, Anna Shcherbakova quietly won gold and runner-up Alexandra Trusova wept and shouted at her coaches as ROC sealed a one-two. Kaori Sakamoto took bronze for Japan. Perhaps the least edifying sight of the entire Beijing Games, after all the pressure that has been heaped on Valieva’s shoulders, was her coach, Eteri Tutberidze, barking in her ear after the 15-year-old had fallen twice during her routine. “Why did you let it go?” she demanded. “Explain to me, why. Why did you stop fighting? You let it go after that axel. Why?” For once, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach has broken his unwritten rule of absolute diplomacy at all times, describing the scenes after the event as “chilling”. Sean Ingle has more on Bach’s words here. Also speaking out was Sweden’s speed skating gold medallist Nils van der Poel. Back home from Beijing, he told Sportbladet: “The Olympic Village was very nice, the Chinese people I met were absolutely amazing. The Olympics is a lot, it’s a fantastic sporting event where you unite the world and nations meet. But so did Hitler before invading Poland, and so did Russia before invading Ukraine. I think it is extremely irresponsible to give it to a country that violates human rights as blatantly as the Chinese regime is doing.” Belgium meanwhile have easily got the best speed skating uniform, but it hasn’t delivered them many medals. Mathias Voste couldn’t add today to Hanne Desmet’s bronze in the women’s 1000m earlier in the Games, finishing 27th in the men’s event. Team GB’s Cornelius Kersten came ninth as Dutchman Thomas Krol won gold. Finland are guaranteed a silver medal at worst in the men’s ice hockey. Over the years they have had two silvers and four bronzes, but they’ve never won gold. They beat Slovakia 2-0 in today’s early semi-final, while defending champions ROC will play Sweden to decide who faces them this evening. Unfortunately you might have missed the women’s 12.5km mass start biathlon – they bought it forward from tomorrow due to an adverse weather report and I failed to notice – my apologies. Justine Braisaz-Bouchet of France didn’t miss – she held off a twin Norwegian threat to take gold. “In the first weeks of the Olympics I did not have the equipment or the shape, I don’t know what happened, why I was so slow on the track, but I dealt with it,” Braisaz-Bouchet said afterwards. “Today I was very serene and calm.” Nobody could hold off Johannes Thingnes Bø though, who won the men’s mass start for his fifth medal of the Games for Norway – including just the four golds. It was his nation’s 15th gold medal in Beijing, a new record for a country at a Winter Games – overtaking the 14 won by Germany and Norway in 2018, and Canada in 2010. How China citizenship debate clouded Eileen Gu’s Olympics Not just snow: what’s the secret to Norway’s Winter Games success? Mikaela Shiffrin’s two weeks of pain don’t detract from lifetime of greatness You are looking at Team GB’s first – and still possibly only – medallists of the Beijing Games. An 8-4 victory over the USA in last night’s curling semi-final ensures at least a silver for skip Bruce Mouat and his team. They play Sweden for gold tomorrow, while Canada picked up the bronze today. Times are all in local Beijing time.

First in [Kamila Valieva’s] performance, how high the pressure must have been on her. To see her struggling on the ice. But this was not all. When afterwards I saw how she was received by her closest entourage, with what appeared to be a tremendous coldness … Rather than giving her comfort, rather than trying to help her, you could feel this chilling atmosphere, this distance. And if you were interpreting the body language, it got even worse because there were even some dismissive gestures I saw on TV. – Thomas Bach, IOC president",Sport/Sport,Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics daily briefing: Gu and Norway set records,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/18/winter-olympics-beijing-2022-daily-briefing-15
