2/16/2022,"Over the past 11 years of men’s tennis, during which Novak Djokovic rose to dominance and improbably positioned himself as one of the greatest to play the game, the only time his success has been in doubt came after the summer of 2017 when he suffered through many months with an elbow injury. The injury became a point of contention between himself and his then-coach, Andre Agassi, who later said that he had swiftly advocated for surgery. But Djokovic addressed the injury by resting for nearly six months, believing his body was built to heal itself naturally. It was not. After returning the next year to pain and early losses, Djokovic finally underwent surgery in February 2018. As he digested his guilt about agreeing to the surgery, he cried for days.  On Tuesday, Djokovic gave his first full interview since his deportation from Australia after arriving in the country without being vaccinated against Covid. Djokovic acknowledged that, as things stand in a worldwide sport that moves from country to country each week, his unvaccinated status means he is unable to play in the majority of tournaments. “That is the price I am willing to pay,” he said. In the same breath, Djokovic said with a smile that at such a critical moment in tennis history he understands his actions may deprive him of the possibility of winning the highest number of grand slam tournaments. He framed his decision in libertarian terms: “The principles of decision making on my body are more important than any title or anything else.” Djokovic’s conversation with the BBC was a reminder that his propensity for self-sabotage has become a defining trait. The principles that made him so averse to surgery in 2017 were not in tune with reality. After his surgery, he won the final two majors of that 2018 season and he has won eight since. The most controversial on-court moment of his career so far, his disqualification from the 2020 US Open after unintentionally hitting a line judge with a ball, came after near misses from which he failed to learn. Here he is again, his own worst enemy. As Djokovic attempts to navigate the world while unvaccinated – and while his biggest rival, Rafael Nadal, just took advantage of his absence to win a historic 21st grand slam title at the Australian Open – according to the ATP 99% of the top 100 is now vaccinated. He stands alone. Within the context of his playing career, Djokovic’s stubbornness has been an admirable quality. He emerged at a time when only two players were competing to be the greatest of their generation yet he had the audacity to not only believe he could break the duopoly of Nadal and Roger Federer, while so many crumbled in their presence, but he did so in time. He has spent his career constantly recovering from impossible deficits, defying crowds roaring for his demise. Although an invaluable quality as an elite sportsman, outside of the sporting bubble those qualities often just scan as selfish and hubristic. While the experience of twice being detained in Australia and then being deported might lead some to consider their decisions and look to make their life easier, it is hard not to think the experience has only further strengthened Djokovic’s beliefs. During his interview, Djokovic continually attempted to distance himself from the anti-vax movement. His actions speak louder than words. While he may not publicly spread Covid conspiracy theories, he was evidently prepared to risk spreading Covid itself when he decided to conduct an interview with a L’Équipe journalist in December two days after testing positive. “I was never against vaccination. I understand that globally, everyone is trying to put a big effort into handling this virus.” he said. He recognises the effect the pandemic has had on the world, yet he has opted out of the current push to address it. Djokovic further claimed he is keeping his “mind open” to vaccination in the future, yet he foreshadowed this entire scenario nearly two years ago in a widely circulated online discussion with his fellow Serbian players. Long before vaccines had come to light, he expressed his concern about the possibility of having to be vaccinated in order to travel. More than a year since the vaccine campaign began, there are numerous types of vaccines and answers to many questions Djokovic could be seeking. Rather than having an open mind, it seems like his thoughts have been set for some time. While he may not want to be seen as someone actively campaigning against vaccination, the result of his actions are evident. Djokovic has already ensured he will be celebrated by such people and the far right, and the manner in which the vultures descended during his time in Australia was telling, with his family even breaking bread with Nigel Farage at Djokovic’s restaurant as they followed one of the Serb’s court hearings. The reality for Djokovic now is no different from the two excellent weeks of tennis in Australia following his deportation. This sport stops for nobody and the other 99 players in the top 100 will continue to compete around the world. As long as Djokovic treads this path and vaccination restrictions remain, he will have to face the consequences of his own decisions.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic’s propensity for self-sabotage has become a defining trait | Tumaini Carayol,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/15/novak-djokovic-propensity-self-sabotage-defining-trait-tennis
2/16/2022,"The work of the American photographer Jesse Alexander, who has died aged 92, captured an era of international motor racing in which the personalities of the drivers and the sleek lines of the cars they drove were not yet obscured by the visual noise of sponsors’ insignia. At a time when competitors, photographers and journalists stayed in the same hotels, dined together and gave each other lifts to and from races across Europe, Alexander became a friend of many of the grand prix aces. Not just the Americans who crossed the Atlantic to try their luck during the postwar years, such as Masten Gregory, Dan Gurney, Richie Ginther and Phil Hill, the fellow Californian who in 1961 would become the US’s first world champion, but such European stars as Stirling Moss, Wolfgang von Trips and Jim Clark.  The action shots he provided for magazines such as Sports Illustrated and Car and Driver were outstanding, but the trust engendered by these personal friendships enabled him to take revealing photographs of the drivers in their less obviously heroic moments. A portrait of Clark at Spa in Belgium in 1962 showed not the elation of a young driver in the immediate aftermath of collecting the first world championship grand prix win of his career, but his exhaustion after a two-hour battle to fight his way up from 12th place on the starting grid to victory on a fast and notoriously dangerous track. Alexander’s backstage shots could include the more light-hearted image of an informal backgammon game on the steps of a hotel between two playboy drivers, the Franco-American Harry Schell and the Spanish aristocrat Alfonso de Portago. But they often reflected his interest in the less glamorous side of the sport, particularly among the men who wielded spanners and oily rags. “Perhaps the most important side of my work is the human side to it,” he once said. “A part of me somehow relates to the people who do the grunt work. In the 1950s the mechanics got their hands dirty and were as emotionally involved in the sport as the drivers.” To that end, between trips to Formula One races, Le Mans, the Mille Miglia and the Targa Florio, he visited workshops and test sessions where he could portray the hard work undertaken away from the crowds and the spotlight. But even a photograph of a car being unloaded from a transporter, a factory interior or a shirtsleeved Enzo Ferrari conferring with his chief designer would be composed and lit with an eye developed through his admiration of such photographers as Edward Steichen, W Eugene Smith, Jacques Henri Lartigue, Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Capa. Born into a wealthy family in Santa Barbara, California, Jesse was the son of Florence (nee Lyman) and Junius Alexander and grew up in Montecito, close to the ocean. After boarding schools in Massachusetts and Connecticut, he returned to study photography at the University of California in Santa Barbara. Already car-mad, he bought an MG TD in which he drove to watch races at Pebble Beach, Golden Gate Park and his local track, laid out on an airfield. In 1953 he travelled to Mexico to watch and photograph the Carrera Panamericana, a spectacular and highly dangerous four-day race over 1,900 miles of open roads, won by Juan Manuel Fangio in a Lancia. The following year Alexander took his wife and the first of their four daughters to Europe, where at the first race he attended, the French Grand Prix at Reims, the Mercedes-Benz team made their return to Formula One, with Fangio as the No 1 driver. A memorable photo taken during a break in practice for that race shows the 42-year-old Argentinian perched on a pit counter as three younger drivers – Eugenio Castellotti, Peter Collins and Olivier Gendebien – listen intently to what he has to say. In 1958 Alexander commissioned the architect Ernst E Anderegg, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, to design a house for his family in Hohfluh, Switzerland, where his motor racing friends often came to stay. Once built, its appearance so scandalised the local authorities that they changed their building regulations. Covering thousands of miles in a Porsche coupe laden with the latest cameras, Alexander was a regular presence at the circuits until the early 70s, thereafter making occasional trips back to Europe for the 24 Hours of Le Mans or, latterly, the Goodwood Festival of Speed. Outside motor sport, he co-directed short films about Billingsgate fish market in London in the 60s and the construction of a modernist house in the hills above Santa Barbara. He took pictures of Bobby Kennedy on the campaign trail and, in his later years, birds being cared for at a raptor centre. His several books of motor racing photographs include At Speed (1972), Looking Back (1982) and Driven (2000), for which Moss provided an affectionate foreword. Alexander is survived by his second wife, Nancy, whom he married in 1965, their son, Jess, and his four daughters, Rori, Heidi, Andi and Susie, from his first marriage, to Patricia Beckham, which ended in divorce.

2/16/2022,"The knockout stage of Big Cup begins this evening, and thoughts naturally turn to Barcelona. They’re not in it, of course, but that’s exactly why everyone’s thinking about them. Barça shipped three goals on three occasions in the groups, and so now they’ve got a battle on to make the last 16 of Big Vase instead. Looking on the bright side, at least the likes of Bayern Munich, Roma and Liverpool can’t get at them from where they are now – though let’s hang fire on confidently declaring this new environment a humiliation-free safe space until we see what Napoli do to them in that Vase play-off game.  There is one player still in Big Cup who, if you cut him, would bleed blaugrana. Yes, it’s Lionel Messi, now plying his trade with all the other good-time charlies at PSG. Only the fiercely partisan, or those without a grasp of the fundamentals of broad-brush slapstick, would fail to find great humour in the GOAT suffering yet another 8-2 hiding on the biggest stage in club football. Nothing personal, you understand, but with the petroclubs having long gained the upper hand, we have to take our fun where we can get it, and if that means Messi once again watching in impotent despair from afar as ball after ball whistles into the net up the other end, each goal taking an oil-fuelled superclub further away from that elusive holy grail, then so be it. Take a hit for Team Humanity, Leo. But, truth be told, such delicious waves of bittersweet schadenfreude are unlikely to wash over us and cleanse the soul. For a start, PSG face Real Madrid in their Round of Arsenal tie, so any satisfaction derived by the pricking of petrohubris would be almost completely offset by the identity of their conquerors. It’s not exactly a romantic David-Goliath match-up, is it? Also, Real have only scored one goal in their last three games, their attack so blunt of late that Carlo Ancelotti has been forced to recall Golf’s Gareth Bale, so they’re unlikely to rout PSG tonight. Also also, there’s a fair chance Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappé will run up a cricket score themselves.

2/16/2022,"The stripping of Prince Andrew’s military roles and royal patronages marks a nadir for the Queen’s second son, since sexual assault accusations arose amid concern over his relationship with the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. It’s a fall from grace for the 61-year-old, who was once second-in-line to the throne.  Prince Andrew is born at Buckingham Palace, becoming the first child born to a reigning monarch since Princess Beatrice to Queen Victoria. Andrew joins the Royal Navy as a trainee helicopter pilot. He studies at Dartmouth naval college and completes Royal Marines courses. The prince serves in the Falklands war, after Argentinian forces invade the British overseas territory in the south Atlantic. He served on HMS Invincible as a Sea King helicopter co-pilot. Andrew is promoted to lieutenant, and the Queen makes him her personal aide-de-camp. He serves aboard HMS Brazen as a flight pilot until 1986. Thousands line streets in central London as Andrew marries Sarah Ferguson at Westminster Abbey, and on the same day the Queen makes him Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh. They have two daughters, Princess Beatrice, born in August 1988 and Princess Eugenie, born in March 1990. He and the Duchess of York announce they are to separate. Divorce is finalised in May 1996, although the two remain close. Andrew is reportedly introduced to Epstein, an investment banker and financier, through a mutual friend, Ghislaine Maxwell – the daughter of the late media tycoon Robert Maxwell. A photograph that comes to light during Maxwell’s 2021 trial for sex trafficking shows her and Epstein at the Queen’s Balmoral residence that year. Epstein, Maxwell and Andrew are seen at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. Later that year, Epstein and Maxwell attend a joint birthday party at Windsor Castle hosted by the Queen, and the prince throws a shooting weekend for Maxwell’s birthday. According to Virginia Giuffre, Andrew sexually assaults her at Maxwell’s home in Belgravia, London and also twice more, at Epstein’s New York home and at an “orgy” on his private island in the Caribbean when she was 17. The allegation has prompted a comprehensive denial from the Duke of York. Andrew retires from the Royal Navy as commander. He was later given a promotion to rear admiral in 2010 and vice admiral in 2015. The government appoints him as special representative for international trade and investment. He represents the UK at trade fairs and conferences around the world. The prince visits Epstein in New York, after his release from prison for pleading guilty to prostituting minors. They are photographed walking through Central Park. The Duchess of York is filmed by a tabloid reporter claiming the prince would meet a donor and pass on business contacts if she received £500,000. Andrew quits his trade envoy role after a furore about him visiting Epstein in New York after he had been jailed for sexual offences. Ferguson also admits accepting money from Epstein to pay off debts. Allegations that Andrew had sex with Giuffre emerge in court documents in Florida related to Epstein. They say she was forced to have sex with him when she was 17, which is under the age of consent under Florida law. Buckingham Palace denies the allegations. Epstein is found dead in his jail cell after being re-arrested and charged with sex trafficking. Andrew steps back from public duties “for the foreseeable future” after a disastrous BBC TV interview where he claims he could not have had sex with Giuffre because he was at home after a visit to Pizza Express in Woking, that her description of his dancing with her beforehand could not be true because he was unable to sweat and that he had “no recollection of ever meeting this lady”. A New York judge rejects the prince’s attempts to throw out a sexual abuse civil lawsuit brought against him by Giuffre. The Queen strips her son of a range of military affiliations and royal patronages after more than 150 veterans write to describe their “upset and anger”. Giuffre requests testimony from Andrew’s former assistant, Robert Olney, on grounds she has “reason to believe” that he has “relevant information about Prince Andrew’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein”. Andrew’s lawyers ask to question Giuffre’s husband and psychologist on grounds that she may have “false memories”. Shukri Walker, who may have seen Andrew with Giuffre at a London nightclub 20 years ago, says she is “willing” to provide testimony in Giuffre’s civil lawsuit. Her lawyer said “she remembers the night clearly because she never saw a royal before or since”. In legal filings submitted to the New York court, Andrew denies that he was a co-conspirator of Epstein and that the disgraced financier trafficked girls to him, and insists on a jury trial. His lawyers also reiterate their previously unsuccessful claim that Giuffre’s 2009 settlement with Epstein shields Andrew from litigation. A date in March is set for Andrew to give evidence under oath. In a remarkable turnaround, Andrew reaches a settlement in principle with Giuffre in which he agrees to make a “substantial donation” to a charity, and accepts that Giuffre “suffered as an established victim of abuse”. In a document submitted to the New York court, Andrew says he regrets his association with Epstein.",News/UK news,The fall of Prince Andrew – a timeline,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/prince-andrew-a-timeline
2/16/2022,"Republicans in states across America are targeting LGBTQ rights through a wave of “educational gag orders”, a free speech group has warned, as conservatives battle to censor discussion of race and sexual identities in schools. More than 100 bills censoring teachers have been introduced in state legislatures this year, according to a report by PEN America – a non-profit which works to protect freedom of expression in the US – in what the organization says is a “national assault on our education system”.  The warning comes as conservatives have launched efforts to ban books pertaining to race and LGBTQ+ issues from classrooms in various states, while some legislatures are pushing to introduce laws which would ban teachers from discussing homosexuality. “From book bans to educational gag orders, schools and universities are being threatened today to a degree that has no recent parallel,” PEN America said. “There is a willingness, and even eagerness, to bring the weight and power of government to bear on controlling classroom speech.” In the last year, PEN America counted 155 bills introduced in 38 states that would censor what teachers can say or teach in classrooms. In 2022 there has been a “steep rise” in the introduction of what PEN America calls “gag orders”, the organization said. Florida’s ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill, which would ban discussion of sexuality and gender identity in schools, has already been widely criticized, with Pete Buttigieg, the US transportation secretary, among those who have condemned the bill as dangerous. The legislation was passed by the statesenate’s education committee on February 8, and has been endorsed by Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor. The bill, which must pass the full Florida senate and the house before becoming law, would allow parents to file lawsuits against school boards if they believe policies violate the law. A bill introduced in the Kansas house on February 9 would change the state’s obscenity law, PEN America reported, making it a class B misdemeanor for a teacher to use any material which depicts “homosexuality” in a classroom. In Arizona, Republicans have introduced a bill which would require parental consent for a student to join a school club “involving sexuality, gender or gender identity”. “As a result,” PEN America said, “gay and bisexual students seeking support from their classmates would essentially have to out themselves to their parents first.” PEN America said the wave of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation was linked to the anti-critical race theory (CRT) movement, which has seen some states ban discussion of the modern-day impact of historic racism in the US. CRT is an academic discipline that examines the ways in which racism operates in US laws and society. “[The anti-critical race theory movement] has primed the public to support sweeping censorship of classroom speech. For anti LGBTQ+ activists, this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, a chance to ram through bills that are far more restrictive than anything the public would normally accept. The goal is quite simply to lock LGBTQ+ topics on the wrong side of the schoolhouse gate,” the report from PEN America said.",News/World news,Bills to ban US schools’ discussion of LGBTQ+ issues are threat to free speech – report,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/lgbtq-rights-ban-us-schools-republicans
2/16/2022,"The iconic tenor of my lifetime – and in terms of sheer voice, the very best – was Luciano Pavarotti. I only heard him once in the flesh, in a production of Verdi’s La Forza del Destino at London’s Royal Opera House. His interest in the stage action was limited, but his vocal resources were only marginally depleted after decades of shining high Cs, and I felt the magic. What had propelled Pavarotti into the stratosphere of international celebrity was a celebratory event at the 1990 World Cup in the Baths of Caracalla in Rome: the famous Three Tenors concert in which he sang Puccini’s aria from Turandot, Nessun Dorma, with its climactic high B on the word “vincero” – “I will win”.  I was then a young singer making my way in the apparently more rarefied worlds of Lieder and Mozart opera, and I was more than a little snobbish about all this; a snobbishness that no doubt sprang from defensiveness about my vocal capacities, as well as protectiveness for the leaner repertoire that I performed and loved. Sir Colin Davis very adventurously once asked me to sing the Verdi Requiem, the nearest I ever got to the Italian big guns, but I knew it was not for me. But the Ron Howard documentary on Pavarotti set me thinking about what we really value in great singing. The triumphalism, the sheer athleticism of the classic tenor voice is all very well, but watching Pavarotti singing Puccini’s E lucevan le stelle from Tosca, late in his career, conducted by his friend and fellow tenor Plácido Domingo, I realised that he was not just a voice, not just a tenor, but an expressive artist of extraordinary gifts. The desperation of the aria draws from Pavarotti that miraculous interaction between the personal life experience and artistic material that is at the heart of what great singers do. Great singers such as Pavarotti, or Billie Holiday, or Bob Dylan. My latest recording is a collection of 17th-century Venetian and Neapolitan opera arias, written in an era in which the tenor was not the shining star he became in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. Indeed, the beginnings of the tenor were lowly. The term itself comes from the Latin verb “tenere” – “to hold” – and emerged from medieval vocal ensemble music in which the higher male voice provided an underpinning in terms of pitch and long vowels. Nothing glamorous there. But by the early 17th century, the tenor had emerged as a crucial figure in the development of the new form of opera. The earliest opera that we still perform as part of the repertoire is Monteverdi’s Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Gonzaga court at Mantua, with the dominating title role played by a tenor. As Giovanni Battista Dona had it in 1635, “the tenor has a better adjusted and more perfectly organised body,” something with which we can all agree. The story that is usually told is that the glamour of the castrato singer – a male mezzo soprano or soprano with prodigious power and virtuosity – came in the course of the 17th century, to force the tenor into the shadows. While there is an element of truth in this, it remained the case that significant roles were written for particularly charismatic singers with tenor voices, well into the 18th century – not least the Handelian triumvirate of Francesco Borosini, Annibale Pio Fabri and John Beard. It’s also the case that arias written for high voices, castrato and female, were often reassigned to lower male voices in so-called octave transposition. Handel did this, as did many of his contemporaries, adjusting their music to the voices on hand. My recording includes both of these sorts of arias, and what has interested me most in them has been the opportunity they offer for a sort of singing that is far removed from the clarion high-wire ascendancy of the post-Romantic tenor and the roles for which Pavarotti and Domingo were most famous. The orchestras these arias were written for were smaller, as were most of the theatres they were sung in. The instruments were less loud. The vocal writing can be florid but it never focuses on sheer virtuosity, either in terms of fast passage work or cultivated high notes. There is an opportunity here to cultivate the ideal set out by one of the earliest opera composers, the tenor Jacopo Peri, of whom it was said that “his singing would have moved to tears any heart of stone”. The emphasis is on the natural voice, not over-projected, moving within a moderate extension of its speaking range and using vowel sounds and consonants to create colours in much the same way as the great jazz singers – Billie Holiday for example. I’ve spent quite a lot of time in the past couple of years working with the jazz pianist and composer Brad Mehldau. He wrote us a song cycle, The Folly of Desire, with texts by Blake, Brecht, Yeats and Cummings among others, and with a stylistic compass from the delicately classical to a raucous impersonation of Supertramp (“with Wurlitzer”, as the directions at the head of the song read). In recital we would then perform Schumann’s Dichterliebe and a set of jazz standards, on one occasion in Prague segueing seamlessly from Schubert’s Nacht und Träume into Cole Porter’s Night and Day. Returning to the baroque after this excursion, I remembered the great William Christie, creator of the French baroque group Les Arts Florissants, telling me 25 years ago – much to my bafflement – how much jazz there was in this music. And I note now that my favourite contemporary jazz vocalist is Cécile McLorin Salvant, trained in the French baroque. Maybe the artificial barriers are breaking down? And maybe classical singers are not first and foremost tenors, sopranos, baritones or what not, but just singers plain and simple.

2/16/2022,"The Future Fund has been forced to divest about $5m in taxpayers’ money from a Chinese state-controlled weapons manufacturer sanctioned for selling arms to the genocidal Myanmar military. Last year, the Guardian revealed that Australia’s sovereign wealth fund had invested $4.9m in five subsidiaries of the Chinese arms conglomerate Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC).  AVIC had sold the Myanmar military K-8 light combat aircraft, 16 JF-17M combat aircraft, 40 short-range PL-5E missiles and 24 longer-range PL-12 missiles. The Future Fund divested from AVIC in November, a month after the investment was revealed in freedom of information documents. The government is trying to shield the Future Fund from future FOI requests about its investments. At Senate estimates on Tuesday, Greens senator Nick McKim asked Future Fund chief executive, Dr Raphael Arndt, whether the divestment was only made due to the embarrassment of the FOI. Arndt said the divestment was made due to US sanctions against AVIC. “In August 2021, the US treasury announced that there would be investment sanctions against one AVIC subsidiary, being Avic Shenyang Aviation Company Ltd, which is one of the companies we had an investment in,” Arndt said. “[We] proceeded to divest that position. Under the sanction that was issued, they had until June of this year to do that and I believe the response to the FOI request was October 2021. In November of 2021, that position was fully divested.” UN investigators say Myanmar’s military, known as the Tatmadaw, executed 2017 “clearance operations” with “genocidal intent” against the ethnic minority Rohingya in Rakhine state. Evidence suggests the military was involved in mass killings, including of children, as well as gang rapes, arson and torture. The UN also found in 2019 that China was breaching international humanitarian law by transferring military supplies through AVIC to the Tatmadaw. Arndt said the $4.9m investment in AVIC was made through an index fund, and that the Future Fund doesn’t look at individual companies it invests in through index positions. That is left to third-party investment managers, he said. But McKim said it was clear the divestment would not have happened without the FOI request. “The Future Fund had been caught out investing Australians’ money in companies facilitating the coup in Myanmar, massacres of civilians and the brutal repression of democracy,” he said. “Coupled with the Future Fund’s previous investments in the Adani Group, this clearly highlights why we shouldn’t allow the secrecy of making their investments exempt from freedom of information laws, as the government is proposing.” In anticipation of the Future Fund’s appearance at estimates, an alliance of aid, human rights groups and unions wrote to the chair of the fund, Peter Costello, to express their alarm at the revelations. The groups included Amnesty International, Justice for Myanmar, the Australian Council for International Development, the Australian Centre for International Justice, and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. “Any Future Fund investments in companies supplying arms to, or in partnership with, the Myanmar military are fuelling the very human rights abuses that are causing the dire humanitarian situation in Myanmar necessitating the provision of humanitarian and development aid to mitigate the impacts of those abuses,” the group said. “It undermines the Australian government’s support for a return to peace and democracy in Myanmar, its own humanitarian and development support and its support for Asean’s five-point consensus and an end to the violence unleashed by the military.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The government is seeking to shield the Future Fund from future FOIs about its investments. The changes, if passed, would grant wide-ranging exemptions to the Future Fund from FoI law.

2/16/2022,"The Coalition used its $187m safer communities grants program to fund at least 10 projects that had been deemed “unsuitable” by the department after the project applicants were visited in person by Peter Dutton’s assistant minister, Jason Wood. An auditor general’s report into the program released on Monday also revealed that decisions to award grants against the recommendations of the department had been influenced by the lobbying of MPs and senators. It raised concerns about applicants having direct access to decision-makers.  The audit, which found the program favoured Coalition-held seats in the lead-up to the last election, is critical of how grants were awarded with more than half delivered without a “clear basis for the decision”. Over five rounds of the program – which fell under the responsibility of Dutton as then home affairs minister – 225 applications were awarded funding worth $47.9m against the recommendations of the department. Of these, 23 projects worth a combined $7m were “assessed as either ineligible or unsuitable”. According to the audit, nine “unsuitable” applications were approved for a combined $3m of grant funding in round four of the program, which was opened just before the 2019 election, with five of these decisions being “informed by a visit by the minister during the assessment process”. “However, the records did not explain how the information obtained during the visit had impacted upon how well each application was considered to have performed against the published merit criteria,” the audit stated. The ministerial visits by Wood, the assistant home affairs minister, happened after applications for the round had already closed ahead of the 2019 election. Another five of these “unsuitable” projects were awarded funding after representations were made from MPs and senators, despite the records not explaining “how the representation had impacted upon how well each application was considered to have performed against the published merit criteria”. All of the projects funded after Wood’s visits were assessed as unsuitable against the published merit criteria, scoring between 33 and 53 out of 100, and “each failing the published threshold of scoring at least 50 per cent against one or more of the individual criteria”. In another round, seven projects were successful on the basis of a ministerial visit, with five previously assessed as “unsuitable” and another deemed ineligible. The unsuitable ranking meant that the merit scores received by the projects “were not high enough for it to either be recommended for funding or included on the list of candidates for the reserve list”. One of those projects was approved on the basis of both a ministerial visit and a letter from the local MP in support of it. Commenting on the manner in which grants were awarded, the audit highlights the “importance of transparent and equitable access to grant funding opportunities”. It compares the process used in the program to the problem that would arise if tenderers were able to “engage directly with the decision-maker” for government procurement. “Applicants for grant funding invest time, effort, and resources in preparing and submitting their applications,” the audit states. “The CGRGs (Commonwealth Grants Rules and Guidelines) do not specifically address the transparency and equity issues that arise when applicants seek to engage with decision-makers prior to decisions being taken on which candidates will receive grant funding. “As the risks that arise in these circumstances are similar to those that would arise in a procurement if some tenderers were able to engage directly with the decision-maker, there would be benefits in the CGRGs explicitly addressing whether applicants should be able to interact with decision-makers prior to grant funding decisions being taken. “And if so, how risks to the principles of equity, transparency and probity are to be managed.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The projects funded on the back of ministerial visits by Wood were in addition to two projects awarded grants by Dutton during the Braddon byelection in 2016, which were announced prior to an application being made and against the recommendations of the department. The audit raises concern about the impact of ministerial visits on the decision-making process, saying that how they influenced grant decisions was not made clear. “The records of decisions did not set out how information collected during ministerial visits to certain applicants and representations from parliamentarians was being relied upon to inform an assessment against the grant opportunity guidelines.” The auditor general points to the obligations under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act regarding the approval of expenditure by ministers, saying that they are required to “undertake reasonable inquiries to satisfy themselves that the proposed expenditure would be an efficient, effective, economical and ethical use of public resources”. Ministers are required “to record the terms of the approval” under the act, and are also obliged under the commonwealth grants rules to “record in writing the basis for the approval relative to the grant opportunity guidelines and the key principle of achieving value with relevant money”. In parliament on Tuesday, Labor asked the now home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, to explain why the Holland Park Mosque, which had applied for a grant “after being subject to a number of Islamophobic attacks” had missed out on funding. The mosque was vandalised with swastikas and references to the Christchurch shooter as a “saint”. In response, Andrews said that the government “had always acted in the best interests of our communities” but acknowledged there had been some ministerial “intervention”. “There were a range of programs that were assessed by the department and, yes, there was some intervention from ministers responsible to support key programs in a number of seats. “So those opposite can get all precious and work themselves up about how grant funding was in fact allocated, but there were instances where ministers did take specific responsibility to make sure that programs could be supported in various communities.” Wood was contacted for comment.",News/Australia news,"‘Unsuitable’ projects approved for community safety grants after ministerial visits, auditor general says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/16/unsuitable-projects-approved-for-community-safety-grants-after-ministerial-visits-auditor-general-says
2/16/2022,"As a teenager, Dean Nicolle dreamed of planting one of every eucalypt species in Australia. He took his parents to nurseries and requested that they buy “any eucalypt with a different name on it”. Nicolle, a self-described “gum nut” who is now a botanist and ecologist, has been fascinated by plants since he was eight. On a plot of land at Currency Creek, an hour’s drive south of Adelaide, he set about creating his own arboretum. “The first plantings went in in 1992,” he recalls.  Today, Nicolle’s arboretum is comprehensive: it has more than 10,000 plants of more than 900 different species and subspecies of eucalypt. Eucalypts are golden, literally: trees in South Australia and Western Australia have been found to draw up water containing gold and deposit the metal on their leaves and branches. They are blue, too: forests of the iconic plants release compounds called terpenoids into the air, scattering light to give the Blue Mountains its characteristic haze. And eucalypt flowers can be almost every colour conceivable: there’s the purple of the Port Lincoln mallee, the pale pink of the caesia – also known as the silver princess – and the fluorescent yellow of the book-leaf mallee. “Eucalypts have fed obsessions, trailed questions, and leaned against each other in a pyre of ideas and images,” writes Ashley Hay in Gum: The story of eucalypts & their champions, a new edition of which was published in November. “They have been grown, pulped, painted, written – and ignored.” Each year, 25 species are chosen by Eucalypt Australia, a charitable trust, for a public Eucalypt of the Year poll. “It’s primarily an awareness and education tool,” says Linda Baird, chief executive of the organisation. Nicolle, who consulted on the poll, says narrowing down the list for voting was a tough ask. “That’s really difficult when you’re talking over 900 different species of eucalypts.” Voting in the 2022 competition opened this week. So which eucalypts have made the shortlist? Though the terms eucalypt, Eucalyptus and gum tree are often used interchangeably, they aren’t synonymous. Eucalyptus is a genus – a scientific category – of eucalypt. In Australia, plants belonging to the Eucalyptus, Angophora and Corymbia genera are known as gum trees – so called for the sticky substance, called kino, that many of the plants produce. Whether in John Williamson’s twangy cover of Home Among the Gum Trees, or the ghost gums that feature prominently in the landscapes of Albert Namatjira, images of giant eucalypts loom large in the Australian consciousness. As well as the ghost gum – which is also called ilwempe by the Arrernte people – other towering species in contention for Eucalypt of the Year include the mountain ash, which grows up to 100 metres high and is one of the tallest flowering plants in the world. There’s also the much-loved Sydney red gum, the lemon-scented gum and the messmate stringybark, a resilient species that gave rise to the term Eucalyptus. But many eucalypts aren’t trees at all. More than 300 species are shrubs, and some are even pot-plant sized. “Eucalypts grow everywhere from your ankles to 100 metres high,” Baird says. Of the smaller species featured in the voting list is the Mongarlowe mallee, the rarest eucalypt in Australia. There are only six individuals of the critically endangered species left – and they could be as old as 10,000 years. Also known as the ice age gum, the Mongarlowe mallee is thought to be a relic of when conditions in Australia were wetter and cooler, Nicolle says. Previous winners – river red gum, snow gum, red-capped gum/illyarrie and gimlet gum – are ineligible to win this year. “Climate change would be by far the biggest threat to eucalypt species in general,” Nicolle says. “Even though they occur over most of Australia and a lot of different climatic conditions – from the mountains down to the sea – most eucalypt species are quite restricted in distribution. “They’re only adapted to a very narrow climatic range, whether it be rainfall, soil type, temperature, or a combination of all those things.” One example featured on the voting list is the endangered Morrisby’s gum. There are only a few thousand individuals found on two small hills near Hobart. “Because the climate’s been drying there, particularly the winter rainfall over the last decade, the trees have been put under a lot more water stress,” Nicolle says. “Then you get other problems … they’re more susceptible to insect attack and also predation from possums.” As a result, mature trees start to die, without regeneration of new trees. “[Eucalyptus] morrisbyi is just one example of that,” Nicolle says. “But that’s happening all over Australia, and particularly southern Australia, where winter rainfall is dropping off.” The increasing frequency of bushfires is also an existential threat. Drive through some regions that have burnt in recent years, and you might see charred trees fluffy with new green growth. This occurs because some eucalypt species have epicormic buds that lie dormant beneath the bark. “There’s a regulatory hormone in the crown [the top part of the tree], which stops the epicormic buds shooting normally,” Baird says. Damage such as by fire results in extensive sprouting and revegetation. “Then other places you go to, the trees are dead,” Baird says. “They just don’t have this ability.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Nicolle says: “There’s about 80 species that are killed by fire, so they only regenerate by seed.” This includes the mountain ash and the coral gum. For some species, regeneration to maturity takes decades. “If you’re getting fires more often than the trees can seed, grow up again and flower and seed again, then they become locally extinct in an area,” he says. Though eucalypts are evocative of the Australian bush, many species thrive in urban environments. “People forget that there are a lot of smaller-growing species that are quite suitable for home gardens and for planning in parks,” Nicolle says. He would like to see smaller eucalypts such as the octopus mallee, the coral gum and the Moon Lagoon mallee planted more in cities, over popular exotic trees such as Manchurian pears, plane trees and flowering cherries. “While all of those [trees] are good trees, none of them have the biodiversity benefits that some of these eucalypts have in attracting native wildlife.” Eucalypt of the Year voting is open until 30 March.",News/Environment,Eucalypt of the Year: 25 species from tall to small vie for top tree,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/16/eucalypt-of-the-year-25-species-from-tall-to-small-vie-for-top-tree
2/16/2022,"Government funding for private schools has increased at nearly five times the rate of public school funding over the past 10 years according to new analysis, with predictions of a $74bn shortfall in money for public schools this decade despite the shift to a needs-based scheme. The analysis compared combined commonwealth and state government funding for schools in 2009-10 to 2019-20, based on the Productivity Commission’s report on government services, released earlier this month. It was conducted by the public school advocacy group Save our Schools.  In that decade, funding for private schools – including Catholic and independent institutions – increased by $3,338 per student, adjusted for inflation, compared to $703 per student for public schools. Trevor Cobbold, an economist and national convenor for Save Our Schools, disputed claims by state and commonwealth governments that all schools had enjoyed increased funding. “In nominal terms, that is true, but when you take account of inflation, the funding hasn’t kept up with costs, so that means they’ve been cutting the real resources in public schools – and this has been happening for a decade right across the states,” he said. While commonwealth funding of state school students increased by $1,181 over the decade, state spending dropped in that time by $478 per student, the analysis found. “At a state level it’s also been disastrous for public schools, because state governments are the primary funders of public schools and on average, across Australia, they have cut funding,” Cobbold said. In 2017 the Turnbull government passed needs-based education funding legislation based on the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS). The benchmark is an estimate of how much total public funding a school requires to meet its students’ educational needs, and is based on recommendations from the 2011 Gonski review. Under the reform, overfunded independent schools would have their funding brought down to the SRS benchmark by 2029 while underfunded public schools would have their funding increased. However, Cobbold said there was an average shortfall in public school funding of $6.7bn per year between now and 2029, a total of $74bn since the 2019-2020 financial year. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Meanwhile, he said, successive Coalition federal governments had increased funding to private schools such as through the $1.2bn “choice and affordability fund” – designed to soften the financial impact for non-government schools during the transition to a new funding model. “The projections are that until the end of the decade, private schools will be overfunded – [that is,] funded over 100% of their Schooling Resource Standard – and public schools won’t even be funded to 91%,” he said. The Australian Education Union’s pre-budget submission has called for an “urgent” and “bold” investment in public school funding, including calling for the commonwealth to fund schools to a minimum of 100% of the SRS. Margery Evans, chief executive of Independent Schools Australia, stressed that the “vast majority” of enrolment growth in the independent school sector in the past five years was in low to medium fee schools. “These are the schools that receive higher levels of government funding overall due to their communities’ lower capacity to contribute,” she said. Under the current school funding agreement struck in 2019, the commonwealth contributes 80% of the SRS for private schools, while state governments are responsible for the remaining 20%. The split is reversed for public schools. But Cobbold said the states’ “formal target” for public schools was only 75%, contributing to the under-funding. Additionally, he said the current funding agreement also allowed states to include in its SRS contributions spending on items not originally deemed part of the Gonski benchmark such as depreciation, transport and payroll tax. New South Wales’ education minister, Sarah Mitchell, said because the figures in the Save Our Schools analysis were not taken directly from the Productivity Commission Report they were “unable to be validated by the Department of Education”. Mitchell said growth in the state’s expenditure for each student from 2010-11 to 2019-20 had exceeded all other states and territories and was more than double the national average. Victoria’s education minister, James Merlino, said since 2014-15 the state had increased its recurrent spending for government school students by more than 30%. “I have repeatedly asked the Commonwealth to do its fair share and fund the final 5% of the schooling resource standard for government schools – and it has consistently refused to do so,” he said. Overall, in 2019-20 the commonwealth spent $3,246 on public school students and the states spent $11,935, for a total of $15,181. Meanwhile, the commonwealth spent $10,211 for each private school student and the states spent $2,978, a total of $13,189. The figures exclude user cost of capital, depreciation, payroll tax and school transport as these items are not included in the funding figures for private schools. Cobbold said the upcoming federal election provided an opportunity to recast education funding as a key policy area, or else inequalities in funding would worsen over the rest of the decade. A spokesperson for the acting education minister, Stuart Robert, said the government services report showed the commonwealth’s investment had grown faster for both government and non-government schools compared to states and territories. “The Morrison government is proud of providing record school funding to all schools to meet the educational needs of Australian students now and into the future, with $315.2bn to be provided to schools between 2018 and 2029 under the government’s Quality Schools package.” The federal opposition’s education spokesperson, Tanya Plibersek, said a Labor government would work with states and territories to ensure every public school was “on a path to its full and fair level of funding”.",News/Australia news,"Private school funding has increased at five times rate of public schools, analysis shows",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/16/private-school-funding-has-increased-at-five-times-rate-of-public-schools-analysis-shows
2/16/2022,"Floodwaters carrying “blackwater” lethal to aquatic life are moving south in the Barwon-Darling river towards the Menindee Lakes, raising fears the situation may cause a repeat of events in 2019 where over a million native fish were killed. Blackwater events are caused when heavy rains wash leaf litter that has collected on a floodplain into a major river such as the Barwon-Darling, turning it the colour of dark tea.  Australian National University (ANU) ecologist Dr Matt Colloff said they were dangerous to aquatic life as the organic compounds plants used for protection against insect attack leached out of leaf litter and dissolved into the river. “Bacteria then break down the dissolved organic compounds and release carbon dioxide,” Colloff said. “In the process of metabolising carbon, the bacteria use up the oxygen in the water.” Colloff said once concentrations of dissolved oxygen fell below about 2-3mg/L, fish suffocated because they could not draw enough oxygen from the water through their gills to survive. As blackwater events move slowly and can stretch for kilometres, there is no way for fish and other aquatic life to swim through it. Depending on the geography of the area, they can be left with nowhere to hide as the waters approach, resulting in a mass die off. The Menindee Lakes were hit by a mass die off in 2019 that is thought to have killed more than a million native fish, devastating stocks of bony herring, Murray cod, silver perch and golden perch. A spokesperson for NSWWater said in a statement the blackwater had started arriving in the upper Menindee lakes at Lake Weatherell, where the Barwon-Darling enters the system. There had been “no scope for intervention” upstream of the artificial lake system “all the way to the Queensland border”, the statement said, but efforts were under way to “shandy” the blackwater by releasing fresh water into it. “WaterNSW is releasing some of this low-quality blackwater from Lake Wetherell into the adjoining Lake Pamamaroo, where it is being diluted by better-quality water in Pamamaroo, as well as offering native fish some refuge from the worst of the blackwater. “Exposing this water to the large surface area of Lake Pamamaroo is also intended to improve dissolved oxygen levels.” The spokesperson said the blackwater entering the system had also been aerated as it moved through the gates at Lake Weatherill and Lake Menindee, but stressed the combined efforts were not a “silver bullet”. Menindee resident Graeme McCrabb said he noticed the blackwater arrive on Friday but the action of the water passing through the weir had “broken up” the water and he did not believe a fish kill was currently a risk. “We had, basically, oxygen levels below 1mg/L for extended periods of time – for 24, 48 hours in different sections,” he said. “And anywhere in the Darling, below two is high risk of fish mortality.” The New South Wales Department of Primary Industry’s and Environment was contacted for comment but did not respond to questions about oxygen readings at different stages of the river or reports of fish deaths. Blackwater events do occur naturally when river systems restart after long dry periods, but ANU professor Jamie Pittock said these events were “a natural risk that has been accelerated by poor management”. “Every few years a flood would take the leaf litter away. It’s been 10 years since the last one,” Pittock said. “It does occur naturally but the severity and frequency of these events is increasing as the environmental flows on the floodplain decrease. “The frequency of floods is decreasing because of the excessive amount of water being taken for agriculture and because of governments failing to implement the environmental flows they promised in the 2012 environmental management plan.” Pittock said a failure to regulate floodplain harvesting had also interrupted natural flooding events. While heavy flooding in northern NSW and south-east Queensland was causing the rivers to surge again, he said it would a mistake to treat the current situation as a “return to normal”. Climate change forecasts for the river system predict more severe droughts and floods, a process which is likely to increase the build-up of leaf litter over time. “That is likely to exacerbate blackwater events unless we make more substantial efforts to reduce that risk where we can through managed environmental flows,” Pittock said. NSWWater said the volume of releases into the Lower Darling downstream area was gradually being reduced from 18,000 megalitres a day down to 500 megalitres a day by the start of April. “The reduction in releases follows a prolonged period of higher releases into the Lower Darling, and is at a rate intended to maintain downstream flow while retaining as much water in the lakes at the end of the current inflow event, as required by operational regulations.”",News/Environment,Lethal ‘blackwater’ in Barwon-Darling river prompts fears of another mass fish kill,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/16/lethal-blackwater-in-barwon-darling-river-prompts-fears-of-another-mass-fish-kill
2/16/2022,"The Morrison government is considering whether a little-known section of national environmental laws could be used to allow developments in some parts of the country to proceed without the need for federal approval. The move, revealed in documents released to Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws, could allow the commonwealth to reduce its role in environmental decision-making without needing support for a bill to transfer power to the states and territories which has been blocked by the Senate since last year.  A year ago, a review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, led by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel, called for an overhaul of Australia’s environmental protections to address the decline of the country’s wildlife. Since then, legislation that would clear the way for states and territories to take responsibility for environmental decisions under the act has failed to gain enough support in the Senate, in part because the Morrison government has not adopted a set of national environmental standards recommended by Samuel (instead drafting a weaker version of its own). Internal documents from the federal environment department show the government could instead rely on another section of the act, which allows for regional planning of conservation, to shrink the commonwealth’s approval role. Under national laws, the environment minister may create what is known as a regional plan. These plans are only vaguely described in the act as covering a broad range of biodiversity, social and economic factors and have previously only been used in marine areas to guide conservation and industrial activities. Another section of the act, known as section 37A, allows the federal environment minister to declare certain development activities are exempt from the requirement to gain federal environmental approval where those projects are covered by a regional plan. In last year’s budget, the government announced it would spend $2.7m on a pilot regional plan in an area of Australia that is yet to be announced. Since late last year, it has been consulting several stakeholders about the design of a framework for regional plans, among them state governments, environment and industry groups. An internal departmental briefing document, released under FOI laws, states that two of the pilot’s objectives are to “streamline development decisions by moving away from project-by-project assessments” and “establish that actions taken in accordance with a regional plan declared under s37A of the EPBC Act would not require” a separate federal environmental approval. It states the other objectives are to allow for planning at different geographic scales and to support “targeted investments in protection, conservation and restoration”. The documents have raised concern among environmental groups involved in the consultation, several of whom are supportive of regional approaches to conservation if they are used to improve the environment of a whole area, such as by identifying and protecting critical habitat. “If it goes ahead, this pilot must be about real action to protect our wildlife and natural heritage, not an effort to lock in wholesale exemptions for destructive industries from community and environmental checks and balances, like we’ve seen with the disastrous Regional Forest Agreements,” Suzanne Milthorpe of the Wilderness Society said. A greater role for regional conservation planning – tied to national standards – was a key recommendation of the Samuel review, which suggested the government focus initially on places that were threatened species hotspots. Samuel suggested the government develop regional recovery plans to support this. Members of the threatened species scientific committee have also previously raised regional planning as a tool that could be used to address threats and environmental decline at a landscape level. “Regional plans hold great promise if done to maximise environmental outcomes,” said Alexia Wellbelove, a campaign manager at Humane Society International. “But we would be extremely concerned if they are only going to be used as an alternate pathway to exempt destructive developments from environment approvals without any standards, safeguards or investment for conservation.” The Minerals Council of Australia, which is participating in the consultation, said it was supportive of the government’s regional planning initiative, which, where practical, would “provide a pathway to balance multiple land-use options”. The council’s chief executive, Tania Constable, said: “This will avoid the need for project-by-project approvals, while supporting long-term management of regional environmental and other values.” Warwick Ragg, the National Farmers’ Federation’s general manager of natural resource management, said the organisation hoped some of its long-held concerns about the act could be addressed through a regional focus. This could include making it simpler for land-use sectors, particularly farmers, to seek advice on and understand their obligations under the law. Landscape-scale planning could include incentives for farmers who manage the environment, Ragg said. He said the NFF did not support the standards proposed by Samuel. According to a timeline in the department’s documents, the development of a regional plan in partnership with a willing jurisdiction would take about 18 months. The location would be selected shortly, potentially in time for a pre-election announcement. However, a Senate estimates hearing heard on Monday that conversations with a state or territory had not yet advanced. “Extensive consultation continues with stakeholders to finalise the pilot and location,” a spokesperson for the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said.",News/Environment,FOI documents reveal plan to skip federal environmental approvals for some projects,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/16/foi-documents-reveal-plan-to-skip-federal-environmental-approvals-for-some-projects
2/16/2022,"At 17, with a few dollars in his pocket after a stint of picking shiraz grapes in Mildura in north-west Victoria, future singer-songwriter Archie Roach walked out on to a highway. He smoked three cigarettes and, to decide where he would go next, he tossed a 20 cent coin. Heads would mean following the road sign that read Adelaide, where he had never been. Tails meant returning to Melbourne, to catch up with his siblings. They had been reunited years after state authorities had stolen Roach, aged three, and his brothers and sisters from Framlingham Aboriginal mission in the state’s western district, splitting them into separate foster homes.  The coin landed on heads. Roach found lodgings with the Salvation Army in an ornate, late 19th century building in Pirie Street, Adelaide, known as the People’s Palace. There, he met Ruby Hunter. The tiny, extroverted Ngarrindjeri teenager was also searching for her identity after being stolen at age eight from her grandparents’ home in south-eastern South Australia’s Coorong region. It would become a relationship that allowed them to save each other. Across Australia, frontier violence had given way to a brutal “protection” era in which the states assumed welfare control of Indigenous people, forcing many on to missions and reserves while often removing children. When he was 14 and in foster care, Roach, a Gunditjmara/Bundjalung man, learned in a letter from his sister that both their parents had died. He would later write Took the Children Away, released in 1990, which would become an anthemic ode to these stolen generations. Just as Roach wrote of authorities who “gave us gifts to ease the pain”, Hunter and her siblings were promised they were going to the circus but were sent to children’s homes and split up between foster carers. Roach would later recall in his song Old So & So how when he met Hunter that day, “she could not stop talking”. Roach, now 66, who talks to Guardian Australia from his home on his mother’s country, near Framlingham, where he is Maar nation elder, was always the “shy” one. “I could talk to people in those days if I had a bit of Dutch courage,” he says. “At the time, she was the opposite of who I was.” Their love story is the subject of writer-director Philippa Bateman’s new documentary Wash My Soul in the River’s Flow, to be released in cinemas in March. In it, Roach and Hunter’s relationship is recounted in the songs they performed together in the 2004 premiere of their Kura Tungar – Songs from the River concerts with composer-pianist Paul Grabowksy and the Australian Art Orchestra, as well as backstage and rehearsal footage and interviews, interspersed with footage of the Coorong. “Archie is my silent hero and I’m his rowdy troublemaker,” Hunter says in the film. “She just had this cheeky way about her,” Roach recalls. “Not so much making trouble but had this glint in her eye.” The couple had many children of their own, including sons Amos and Eban and foster children Kriss, Arthur and Terrence. Unofficially they looked after another 15 to 20 children over the years, Roach estimates, admitting he’s never stopped to tally the number. I tell Roach I vividly recall interviewing the couple at their Melbourne kitchen table in 1998, various children dashing past, and how lovely it was when Hunter kept calling me “bub”. “She’d welcome people wherever she was,” says Roach, “whether at home or when we went around the country.” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning When they began singing Took the Children Away or one of the early songs Hunter penned, Down City Streets, which dealt with their homeless years fighting battles with alcohol, were they conscious of opening audience hearts to recognise shared history and truth? “People made us aware by coming up and talking to us,” he says. “They said: ‘We weren’t taught anything about this at school, stolen generations and being removed from families.’ There was nothing being taught about contemporary Aboriginal people and their lives in the cities.” In the concert featured in the new documentary, Hunter wears a headdress made from pelican feathers from her traditional home as well as rock cockatoo feathers amid raffia, sequins and mirrors. The pelican “is really Ruby’s spirit”, says Roach. “In the dreamtime she was a pelican, before she came to Earth and was born as a baby girl. When she passed away, of course, she became a pelican again.” As Roach would sing at the end of Took the Children Away, the children “came back”. When as adults Hunter and Roach returned to the Coorong, “everything just came back to her from when she was a child and they were taken. She just wailed and hit the ground. I felt guilty about taking her back there, you know? I said, ‘Oh, sorry I brought you back here, bub. We’ll go.’ She just looked at me and said, ‘Grab my shoes, I’ll walk around here barefoot.’” Hunter would die of a heart attack, aged 54, in 2010. Roach’s own health has deteriorated. He has lived with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for years and wears a nasal cannula to access oxygen. In late 2020, an ambulance waited on standby outside a theatre, where he was inducted into the Aria hall of fame via live telecast, to ferry him back to hospital, mostly for observation. “I use oxygen most of the day,” he says now. “It’s something that helps me get through and do things.” Roach wrote philosophically in 2012: “My recent bouts of illness, I’m sure, are a result of the Pain [sic] of being removed from my family at a young age and more recently the loss of someone [Hunter] I loved so dearly. But Pain can also bring about change in one’s life for the better, we can choose to ignore the Pain until it becomes unbearable or we can do something.” The excellent news is that Roach is feeling well enough to perform in a free concert with Grabowsky and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra at the Myer Music Bowl in February, and in April will undertake his last road tour of New South Wales, with Queensland dates added. He plans to make more albums and do more concerts, however. “This is the last tour as far as getting on the road, but I’ll still be doing shows wherever I can.” He has also been making Kitchen Table Yarn vodcasts, giving a platform to young up-and-coming music-makers. Writing still alleviates pain, he says. “There’s a healing power in music and I realise that more today, I’m relying more on that healing. It’s a place you can go to when you’re down and not well, but it’s also a place you can go to when you’re on top of the world.” One Song: the Music of Archie Roach is at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl on 19 February. Wash My Soul in the River’s Flow will be released in cinemas across Australia from 10 March. His NSW and Queensland tour runs from 31 March to 23 April, with Adelaide and Perth concerts to follow",Arts/Music,"Archie Roach on meeting, loving and losing Ruby Hunter: ‘She had this glint in her eye’",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/16/archie-roach-on-meeting-loving-and-losing-ruby-hunter-she-had-this-glint-in-her-eye
2/16/2022,"Dave Hughes has been one of Australia’s best-loved comedians for more than two decades. In that time, Hughesy thinks he must have toured “up to 20” different shows. “People always say to me, are you worried about running out of material? And I say no, because life will always be ridiculous,” he wheezes. “And it appears to be getting more ridiculous by the day. So there’s always things to laugh about.”  His latest show, which is coming to both the Adelaide Fringe festival and Melbourne comedy festival this year, is called Trending. It’s about getting blasted on Twitter for various pandemic-related opinions – like suggesting everyone should get vaccinated. The inspiration is “being slandered left, right and centre and how to deal with it,” he says. “You’ve either gotta laugh or cry, and I’ve learned to laugh at people saying nasty things about me.” But Hughesy wasn’t always a conversation-starter. He still has diaries from the days when he was unemployed, living in Perth and only just toying with the idea of getting into comedy. Here, he tells us why he’d save that stack of old exercise books in a fire, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. I would save the diaries that I kept when I was 22 years old. I was living in Perth, I had just given up alcohol, and I was thinking about trying to become a comedian. People who read them say I should turn them into a book, which I’ve never done. But it’s all sitting there: the ambitions of a young bloke who had quit uni, was on the dole, without a girlfriend or any money. Just dreams. I used to write positively about what I wanted to do and the philosophies on life that I had back then, which I think put me in really good stead. It’s quite cool to look back and see how it worked out for me. They document the start of a journey which is still continuing today. My Kindle. I love reading, and the ability to have any book in the world at the tip of your fingers is something I’m making the most of. It also stops my house being cluttered up with books. And, more importantly, reading in bed without a light on stops my wife from hating me, because I can read the Kindle on dark mode. I went to the Australian Open final a few years ago and saw Rafael Nadal play Roger Federer. It was the first time they’d played in the final for ages, and Roger Federer won his first grand slam victory in five years. I had front row seats, which I’d paid quite a bit of money for. As part of getting the seats, I got to keep some of the balls that Roger and Rafael used during the match. But sometime later my dogs got hold of them, chewed them up and they’re gone. I lost a part of history. I love the smell of new tennis balls, so I used to smell Roger and Rafael’s balls and think about the good times we’d had. It’s pretty disappointing to not have Roger and Rafael’s balls any more.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Three things with Dave Hughes: ‘I used to smell Roger and Rafael’s balls’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/16/three-things-with-dave-hughes-i-used-to-smell-roger-and-rafaels-balls
