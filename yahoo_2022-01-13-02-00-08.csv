1/13/2022,"As the coronavirus omicron wave sweeps across the country, testing centers can become busy and you might be looking for an at-home test as an alternative. But with variety of testing kits on the market, the Food and Drug Administration is now warning of a brand that could give inaccurate results. “Stop using the LuSys Laboratories COVID-19 Antigen Test (Nasal/Saliva) and the LuSys Laboratories COVID-19 IgG/IgM Antibody Test,” the agency urged on Jan. 11 in a news release. Both versions have a “high risk of false results” and are believed to have been distributed as at-home testing kits and for lab use, according to the FDA. However, they were never “authorized, cleared, or approved” by the agency for U.S. distribution. These tests might also be sold under names including Luscient Diagnostics, Vivera Pharmaceuticals and EagleDx. Getting a false positive from the company’s antigen test (the nasal and saliva version) when you don’t have COVID-19 but are still feeling sick might delay “both the correct diagnosis and the initiation of an appropriate treatment for the actual cause of a person’s illness,” the FDA warns. Additionally, getting a negative result when you’re actually COVID-19 positive “may lead to delayed diagnosis or inappropriate treatment of (COVID-19), which may cause people harm including serious illness and death,” the agency said. If you or someone you know have used LuSys Laboratories antigen and antibody tests, the agency suggests raising concerns about the results with a health care provider. Health workers who’ve tested patients using the brand’s the antigen test within the past two weeks should “consider retesting your patients” the FDA advises. If you’ve had any issues using a LuSys COVID-19 test, the FDA advises issuing a report. The agency lists a number of at-home COVID-19 antigen tests authorized for emergency use such as a few different BinaxNow options, CareStart and BD Veritor tests. The full list can be viewed here. The agency’s warning comes as the U.S. has had more than 61.8 million positive COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic and as the highly contagious omicron variant makes up a majority of new cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

1/13/2022,"By Francesco Guarascio BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission proposed on Wednesday a suspension of a visa-free travel agreement with the Pacific archipelago of Vanuatu because of its scheme offering passports to rich foreigners. If the proposal is backed by EU states, it would be the first time that the EU imposes sanctions on a country for running ""golden passport"" schemes, which the Commission has repeatedly warned could pose security and money laundering risks. Other countries, including eastern European states are monitored. ""The Commission has concluded that Vanuatu's investor citizenship schemes present serious deficiencies and security failures,"" it said in a statement. Under the scheme, foreigners can obtain Vanuatu citizenship and passport in exchange for a minimum investment of $130,000. That in turn gives them visa-free access to the EU, under a visa waiver agreement the country has with the 27-nation bloc. The Commission has proposed to suspend visa-free travel for all holders of Vanuatu passports released since May 2015 when the investor programme started to operate in earnest in the country. The moratorium would be lifted if the programme is properly amended. The EU executive said the scheme was deemed risky because it essentially accepted all applicants and did not sufficiently screen them, despite some appearing in Interpol's security databases. Vanuatu's embassy in Brussels was not immediately available for comment. The Commission said it was monitoring countries with visa-free access to the EU which are effectively operating or are planning to set up investor citizenship schemes, including Caribbean and Pacific islands and eastern European states Montenegro, Albania and Moldova. Most EU states have their own schemes offering passports or visas to wealthy foreigners, but the Commission considers most of them in line with EU rules, with the exception of programmes set up by Cyprus and Malta. Both states are facing legal challenges from Brussels which require them to change the programmes or stop running them to avoid the risk of a fine.

1/13/2022,"Listen to our daily briefing: Subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Amazon Alexa | Google Assistant | More options Kris Carroll of Charlotte said he couldn’t have picked a better North Carolina mountain home for his family than the one he closed on for a record $6.8 million on Jan. 3. The home at 264 Skycliff Drive in the gated Wildcat Cliffs community offers “amazing” 360-degree mountain views, Carroll told The Charlotte Observer on Tuesday. He’s loved the mountains since his undergrad days at Virginia Tech University in Blacksburg, he said. Wildcat Cliffs is off Town Mountain Road in north Asheville, 2 miles from the Blue Ridge Parkway and about 135 miles northwest of uptown Charlotte. “It’s a really amazing property with an amazing view,” he said. At 7,436 square feet, the home also is spacious enough for Carroll and his wife, his three children and three stepchildren and, perhaps, his parents, he said. The sale was the highest ever for a home in Asheville’s 28804 ZIP code, according to the Beverly-Hanks real estate firm. The median home sales price in the 28804 zip code is $627,500, according to Realtor.com. Beverly-Hanks disclosed the sale in a Jan. 4 news release, without revealing the buyer’s name. The Observer found Carroll’s name through public records. ‘Refined mountain escape’ sets record by selling for $6.8 million in NC tourist town Renée Miller, residential broker associate for Beverly-Hanks’ Biltmore Park office, represented the buyers. In the release, Miller said the buyers originally wanted 50-plus acres to build a private estate with three or four homes for their family, “so we were looking at large tracts of land and large homes on land.” Carroll, 46, was CEO of Carroll Financial in Charlotte until the firm joined Wealth Enhancement Group last month. He is now managing director for the Carolinas of the financial planner, he said. Carroll said he has lived in Charlotte since he was 4. He was born in Tennessee, where his dad served in the military, he said. The family is encouraging Carroll’s parents to sell their home near Blowing Rock and move in with him, he said. Except for a second-floor room above the garage, the home is single-story, he said. That will make it easier for his parents —and his wife’s parents when they visit — to get around, Carroll said. The 4.55-acre property includes “flat grassland,” he said. The four-bedroom home includes a grand salon with a fireplace; a bar made of semi-precious marble; a movie theater; thermal-heated Italian wood-look tile; and Italian porcelain countertops, according to its previous listing on Canopy MLS, where Charlotte-area real estate agents list most properties for sale.. An outdoor terrace includes a stone fire place, and the exterior of the home includes Turkish and Portuguese limestone features.",Business/Charlotte Observer,Charlotte man wanted ‘something pretty big’ for his family.
