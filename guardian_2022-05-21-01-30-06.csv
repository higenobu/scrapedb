5/21/2022,"In the words of the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, Sweden and Finland submitted their historic Nato membership applications this week “hand in hand”. But they have not travelled the same road to the alliance’s Brussels headquarters. Russia’s unprovoked onslaught on Ukraine – ostensibly intended, at least in part, to prevent Nato’s expansion – has ended up achieving the reverse, as the Nordic neighbours have abandoned decades of military non-alignment in a seismic shift in Europe’s security order. Each had very different grounds for staying out of the alliance until now, their neutrality rooted in different geographies, histories and national identities. Both reached the same decision this week, but what went into it was not the same. Finland’s neutrality, experts say, was only ever functional, the only possible way of dealing with the fact that the country shares an 830-mile (1,340km) border with Russia, won independence from Moscow only in 1917, and twice repelled everything the Red Army threw at it during the second world war. “Finnish security policy has always been entirely pragmatic; we’ve just gone for what’s best for us, with no real ideological considerations,” said Minna Ålander, an expert on northern Europe at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin. She said the approach was based on “good relations with Russia, and maintaining a high security capability. Well, since February, the first no longer holds.” For Finland, the membership conversation was all about security: Russia had become an unreliable and brutal neighbour, and only Nato’s collective defence would be enough. It was a big step. Those bitter Finno-Soviet conflicts – in particular the 1939-40 winter war, in which a Finnish army outnumbered three to one inflicted five times the losses it sustained – are a core part of modern Finland’s history and remain a source of lasting national pride. But Finland was eventually forced to cede 10% of its territory and in 1948 signed a friendship and cooperation treaty with the Soviet Union. “We had to accept it was the biggest regional power,” said Henrik Meinander, a University of Helsinki historian. “But we were proud we had avoided occupation. It was a very functional approach; we understood the west would not defend us. And it continued after we joined the EU. But we have always been prepared for things to get worse.” In fact, experts point out, if neutrality – succeeded, after EU membership in 1995, by military non-alignment – has been a fundamental part of Finland’s foreign and security policy for 73 years, in practice things are a little less clear cut. “A lot of deliberate work has gone on since the 1990s to make this moment possible,” said Ålander. Finland’s military, with a fighting strength of 280,000 troops and a total of 900,000 reservists, has a high level of military interoperability with the alliance, and a so-called “Nato option” to allow for rapid accession when the time came. As early as 1992, while it was negotiating to join the EU, Helsinki bought 64 US-made Hornet fighter bombers, a clear indication of which way it was looking, Meinander said. But “politically, culturally, symbolically – this [Nato application] remains a huge move,” he said. Finnish politicians talk of a “moment of national awakening”. Even in January, when Russian troops were massing on Ukraine’s border, Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, was saying it was “very unlikely” that Finland would join Nato during her term. But when parliament voted on the question this week, only eight of its 200 MPs objected. A dramatic shift in public opinion has led the way. Last year one poll put support for Nato membership in Finland at 34%. Last week it stood at 76%. “So yes, I think we can say it’s seismic,” said Ålander. “Logical, yes; something we’ve been preparing for, and working towards the possibility of, absolutely. But I don’t think anyone will tell you that for Finland this isn’t a historic change.” The change in Sweden is equally monumental, said Gunilla Herolf, a senior associate research fellow at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs. “We have maintained one doctrine for 200 years,” she said. “That’s a big deal. It means something to people. It becomes an identity issue.” Ask Swedes for three things that define their country, she said, and many might reply “hunting elk, eating fermented herring – and non-alignment”. With Finland serving as a buffer against Russia, Sweden, which has fought no wars and joined no alliances since 1812, could fashion its neutrality along more idealistic, ideological lines. “We were protected behind Finland, which unlike us never felt safe,” Herolf said. “We had the luxury of being able to say what we liked.” So over the past two centuries, but especially since 1945, Sweden carved out an enviable space for itself: peace, nuclear disarmament, international mediation, support for fledgling democracies worldwide. That became part of the national self-image – and especially of the identity of Sweden’s mighty Social Democrats, who have won every election for 100 years. Many on the left still feel Nato’s nuclear deterrent raises tensions, will make the country less safe and cost it its pre-eminent role in global disarmament. Herolf noted that Sweden, too, had “not always acted as a neutral or non-aligned country should”. It sent military aid to Finland during the winter war, and during the cold war it had secret security contact with the UK and the US – to the point of building runways way longer than its planes needed, to accommodate US jets. She does not buy the Nordic arguments about Finns being inherently more pragmatic than supposedly idealistic Swedes. “I’m not sure Sweden would’ve acted differently to Finland if it had been in Finland’s geographical position,” Herolf said. But it wasn’t, so it cut back its military in the 1990s, and ended conscription, before bringing it back and boosting defence spending again from 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea. Still, many in Sweden – where about 55% now support Nato membership – feel, at the very least, that the decision has been rushed. Many also regret that, albeit for understandable reasons, it was Finland – Swedish territory for fully 600 years – that led the dance. “Finland’s swift decision kind of hijacked the Swedish debate,” said Ålander. “Sweden couldn’t be the only Nordic country outside Nato.” The exposure, added Herolf, would have been too great. Hence, finally, the “hand-in-hand” approach: an acknowledgment of the neighbours’ strong security interdependence and cooperation in defiance of those different national stories. Finland is, at any rate, “very grateful that Sweden, despite the ideological obstacles, has taken this step,” said Meinander. Neither country expects major consequences. Russia has halted electricity exports to Finland and is about to do the same with gas, but both represent less than 10% of overall supplies and have been replaced. Other than that, said Ålander, it would be “disinfo, cyber-attacks, maybe a few airspace violations. We’re ready for that.” When it finally came to it, she said, Russia – in spite of its multiple prior threats – essentially acknowledged what everyone knew already: Finland and Sweden were a lost cause to Moscow the moment they joined the EU. “A lot of people were really surprised by how calmly Russia has taken it,” she said.

5/21/2022,"Florence Griffith Joyner’s imposing and controversial women’s 100m world record of 10.49sec could finally fall this summer, Dina Asher-Smith has forecast. The British sprinter insisted that the rapid improvements in spike and track technology meant “nothing is impossible” for modern athletes – including surpassing Flo-Jo’s iconic 100m and 200m records set in 1988. Last summer the Olympic champion Elaine Thompson-Herah ran 100m in 10.54 on the lightning-fast track in Eugene where the world championships will be staged in July. And Asher-Smith predicted that with a stronger tailwind and more boisterous fans behind the athletes, history could be made. “I think someone can break it, definitely, given the advantages of shoe technology, definitely given the increase in track technology,” said Asher-Smith, who runs her first 100m of the season at the Birmingham Diamond League on Saturday. “I ran in Eugene and that track was great. “That, plus all the advantages – the competition, nice winds, amazing crowds, we have all been starved of crowds because of the pandemic. “We shouldn’t put limits on ourselves,” she added. “When you stop thinking about limits and focus on the processes, who knows what can be achieved? Everything seems impossible until it’s done.” If Griffith Joyner’s 100m world record was to fall it would be greeted with relief by many fans. At the time eyebrows were raised about the American’s rapid improvement, although she never failed a drugs test, as well as whether the wind gauge was correct when she set her record. And when Asher-Smith, whose personal best of 10.83 is a British record, was asked whether she might be the one to break it, she did not demur. “If I said no, what would you say?” she asked. “Crazier things have been done and nothing is impossible. I’m excited to go out there and put together some really good races. Who knows?” Asher-Smith’s confidence is based on a belief that she is a far better athlete than when she won the 200m world title in 2019 – her only frustration being that she has not been able to show it due to the pandemic and a hamstring injury before last summer’s Tokyo Olympics. “It’s been a long, long time since I ran a PB and I’m definitely one of those people who tries to PB year on year,” she said. “It has been annoying. But I’m confident in the work that I’ve done. Just how much of a different person, different athlete I am since 2019 – it’s light years away. When I peak, which is championship time, it will be amazing to lay down some really good times.” Asher-Smith is the headline act in a mouthwatering Diamond League that features multiple Olympic medallists in action, including the Britons Keely Hodgkinson and Laura Muir in the women’s 800m and 1500m respectively, Josh Kerr in the men’s 1500m, and Holly Bradshaw in the pole vault. A capacity crowd of 16,000 will be cheering the athletes on, and the event will be shown live on BBC One. But Asher-Smith conceded that the sport needed to do more to attract bigger audiences. “A Netflix show would be brilliant,” she said. “It would provide a really good insight to get to know what we are like. I would also like to have more events in the major cities, maybe get some more street races back. Make sure we have lots of fun, energetic, energised events. I think that should be the priority to engage Gen Z.” It would also help if athletes were more forthcoming in interviews and the hugely likable Kerr did that this week when he said he “didn’t want to be on a yoghurt pot”. That was an oblique reference to UK Athletics’ sponsor Müller, which has used British stars to promote its yoghurts, but it did not go down well with all his teammates. On Friday, Kerr took the controversy in his stride. “How boring is our sport when that’s making headlines for three days?” he joked. “We need sponsors but I just like to have a bit of fun. “And from a personal standpoint, I’ve been in the sport since I was nine years old and I want to be at the top of the world. When I do that, then we can start talking about me being a poster boy for cereal boxes and yoghurts.”",Sport/Sport,Dina Asher-Smith says Florence Griffith Joyner’s world records are at risk,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/20/dina-asher-smith-says-florence-griffith-joyner-world-records-are-under-threat
5/21/2022,"Manchester United’s dire season – a Premier League club record low points tally of 61 is the best they can hope for – still has room to develop into an armageddon of mind-melting proportions if they slip from a Europa League qualification spot into the Europa Conference League. A win against Crystal Palace secures the second tier competition but if West Ham win and Manchester United lose or draw then to the conference they will go owing to their vastly inferior goal difference. Palace can still finish in the top half but a large number of results will have to go in their favour so a positive season may finish with a small whimper. Patrick Vieira’s Palace have certainly passed the eye test but in practice they may finish only one point and one place better off than last season if they lose against United.

5/21/2022,"Three years ago, Barcelona were humbled in Budapest by a strong and athletic Lyon side powered by more than a decade of investment. By the half-hour it was 4-0, with Ada Hegerberg’s 17-minute hat-trick stealing the show. A late consolation goal by the substitute Asisat Oshoala would do little to ease the bruising. It was the Spanish side’s first Champions League final but Lyon’s sixth European title, their fourth won consecutively, and they added a seventh the following year. As Barcelona players, with tear-stained faces, stopped to speak to the waiting media there was a feeling that the standard they needed to aspire to had been emphatically set. It was thrilling then last summer to see Barcelona dismantle Chelsea with an eerily familiar ruthlessness to lift the trophy for the first time. That 4-0 defeat of Emma Hayes’s side in Gothenburg lifted the pressure on a club that had set conquering Europe as the number one goal. On Saturday, against Lyon in Turin, they have the chance in another final not only to exorcise the ghost of 2019 but to shift the narrative from it having been a crushing defeat to a moment of learning. “For every team that has ambition and goals, when you lose a game you go back to the drawing board and ask yourself questions about why you lost the game, what happened, what went wrong,” said the Barcelona forward Oshoala. “We lost to Lyon three years ago in the final in 2019, yes, but it was also a good defeat for us. It helped us open our eyes and see what we could improve as a team. We needed to play more together, we needed to stay together more, we needed to improve on our defensive activities, we needed to be faster – there were a whole lot of things that went wrong in the game.” The defender Irene Paredes, who joined Barcelona from Paris Saint-Germain last summer having finally pipped a dominant Lyon to the Division 1 title, said that “everyone made a change” at Barcelona after that 2019 final. “They trained more in quantity and quality. Also, a lot of the players are the same and that’s really good because you have the same players, with a lot of talent, and now with a lot of experience. Losing that way helps you be better; you understand what you need to do. Physically as well they have grown a lot.” Talk of a power shift at the top of European women’s football after Barcelona’s trophy win last summer has frustrated Lyon, long-time investors in the women’s game. “There was women’s football before Barcelona, and it was played here for years,” Hegerberg told L’Équipe pointedly before Lyon’s semi-final defeat of PSG last month. “We have to win again to regain our place in world football.” Oshoala is not of the mind that a shift has taken place and goes as far as describing Barcelona as underdogs. “Lyon is the team to beat in Europe,” she said. “They’re one of the powerhouses of women’s football in Europe. It’s not like we’re out for revenge [for the 2019 final] but we want to put on a better show. We lost 4-1 the last time against them and we don’t want the same to happen again. We want people to enjoy football. We want people to have fun. Football is about entertainment. Of course, we want to win, but the most important thing is you want to show the world that you’ve improved, and that you are a better team from the team they saw three years ago.” Paredes’s understanding of Lyon could be part of the key to unlocking them. “I played against Lyon many, many times,” she said. “It’s one of the best clubs in the world, so it’s going to be really, really difficult, but my experience of course counts. I have already talked with my teammates to tell them the things that maybe they don’t know. I will try to use that.” For Lyon, who ended last season without a trophy for the first time in 16 years, there is a real statement to be made about their status in world football. The 14-times Division 1 winners are five points clear of PSG at the top with two games to play and on Saturday will have a chance to reclaim Europe’s biggest crown after a swift transitional season. With the Champions League broadcaster Dazn, which shows fixtures on its YouTube channel from the group stage on, having sublicensed the rights to the final to TV broadcasters across the globe, including ITV in the UK, TF1 in France and TV3 in Spain, interest in the final everyone hoped for, between the seven-times winners and holders, is sky high. For the first time, accommodation anywhere near the ground in the host city of a Women’s Champions League final is hard to come by and expensive. Previously, tickets were predominantly sold to locals rather than travelling fans. Now, Barcelona and Lyon have to put on a show worthy of the stage and hype.",Sport/Football,Barça aim to seal superpower status in Women’s Champions League final | Suzanne Wrack,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/20/womens-champions-league-final-preview-barcalona-lyon
5/21/2022,"“I’ve written lots of things that I’ve happily forgotten about, or that have been remembered fondly,” says Matthew Jacobs. “But the Doctor Who TV movie is very much like a tattoo that just won’t go away.” What is it like to make one sizeable contribution to a much–loved franchise – and then everybody hates it? And, two decades later, to turn up to a fan convention for the very first time, only to find fans still want to tell you to your face how much they hated it? That is the premise of what turns out to be a surprisingly uplifting new documentary about fandom and family called Doctor Who Am I from Jacobs and Vanessa Yuille. “I had distanced myself from the fans,” says Jacobs, whose other credits include The Emperor’s New Groove and The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones. “But, on Doctor Who’s 50th anniversary, everyone started getting interested in me again. I didn’t initially want to go to a convention in Florida. I said, ‘there’ll be some alligators. And Doctor Who fans.’” However, Yuille saw it had great potential for a documentary story. “Matthew thought this was going to be about the fans, but I always knew it was going to be him.” Ncuti Gatwa may be the new 14th Doctor Who, but back in the 90s Paul McGann was “the Doctor of the future”, according to the Radio Times. It wasn’t to be. Coming seven years after the original run of Doctor Who had ended, the movie remains McGann’s only major screen outing in the role. Despite getting over 9 million viewers in the UK, Jacobs’ script didn’t spark the hoped-for new series, and the movie spent years being perceived as a failure. One significant reason was that he had made changes to the very fabric of Doctor Who – McGann had kissed his companion. “You have the incipient romantic aspect of the Doctor really coming to the fore with Paul’s Doctor,” says Jacobs. It didn’t matter how short the companions’ skirts were in the 60s, the rule of “no hanky-panky in the Tardis” had lasted for three decades until, in Jacobs’ script, McGann was suddenly snogging Dr Grace Holloway, played by Daphne Ashbrook. Even worse for some fans, the Doctor unexpectedly revealed in 1996 that he was half-human, on his mother’s side. During the documentary, the executive producer of the movie, Philip Segal, talks about going to a convention and being practically assaulted by a fan who was furious about the movie. Another sequence shows a group of fans looking horrified as Jacobs tries to explain the reasoning behind it, as something that expressed the Doctor’s affinity with humanity, and would appeal to US television executives. They are not convinced. “It was usually the older fans, if we met them, who had a visceral reaction,” says Yuille. The TV movie did succeed in introducing some new US fans to the show, and one of the joys of the new documentary is meeting some of the most enthusiastic cosplayers of the American convention scene. On camera, they share stories about how Doctor Who has comforted them through grief and loss, or made their relationships stronger. Jacobs thinks that when writers and actors go to conventions, they always initially think it is just for the fans’ benefit, but find “they’re being brought into a family” themselves. Jacobs ends up on screen wearing props and trying on monster costumes as people enthusiastically detail how much time they’ve invested making them, and his reluctance to embrace fandom gradually diminishes. Watching the 1996 TV movie again in 2022, it is striking how much the first half-hour feels more like a US medical procedural, rather than the relaunch of a sci-fi/fantasy franchise. Its structure is flawed – giving the seventh Doctor, Sylvester McCoy, a regeneration sendoff was a nice continuity touch at the time, but it eats up a third of the film’s run time. But, as the BBC gears up to celebrate Doctor Who’s 60th birthday next year, the Doctor Who TV film looks less like a forlorn coda to the 1963-89 series and more like a springboard between the “classic” and modern eras. Higher production values, a theme tune rearranged with an orchestra, and the revelation of a mysterious new secret about the Doctor’s past seem nothing unusual in 21st-century Who. The brief kisses between McGann’s Doctor and companion are relatively chaste set next to David Tennant’s 10th Doctor marrying Queen Elizabeth I, and Matt Smith’s 11th Doctor’s very own “time traveler’s wife” in the form of River Song (Alex Kingston). Despite the movie being a one-off, McGann is no George Lazenby among Doctor Whos. The film set in motion a whole range of off-screen continuations in books and comics and McGann has gone on to embed himself as a much-loved part of the franchise. His enthusiastic portrayal of the character trying to recover his identity remains the highlight of the movie, and his Doctor now has over two decades and more than 100 stories behind him on audio. Eddie Robson, who wrote Radio 4’s Welcome to Our Village, Please Invade Carefully recently wrote for McGann’s continuing Doctor Who audio adventures, and says of his Doctor, “Paul has a nice sort of spontaneity as an actor. He has a way of making a line that’s written on the page sound like the first thing that’s come into his head. It’s fun to run with that. He thrives off snappy, short, little bits of dialogue.” When McGann appears at the convention in the documentary, Jacobs says it was like witnessing people waiting to see the pope. McGann eventually reprised the role on TV in a specially shot iPlayer “minisode” as part of Doctor Who’s 50th anniversary celebrations. It is difficult, with hindsight, to recapture just how much excitement there was about Doctor Who returning in 1996. In a very different media landscape, the movie was available to buy on VHS prior to being screened in the UK. Robson recalls bunking off school to get it. “A friend of mine was also a fan. We nipped out of school, went to HMV and bought it, went to his house and watched it and then came back to school. I felt very positive about it. There was a sense of really wanting to like it, really wanting it to be good, and to work, and to lead to something.” It was a bittersweet experience for Sophie Aldred, who played popular 80s companion Ace alongside Sylvester McCoy’s seventh Doctor, as the storyline seemingly signalled the end of her tenure on the show, although she will reprise her role later this year. “I absolutely loved the Tardis in that, I thought yes, that’s what we’d have done if we’d had the budget. I think it really was quite modern. A young, handsome doctor who kissed the companion. It was a precursor to the future, but, in a way, too early.” As the Doctor Who Am I documentary unfolds, it becomes clear that writing the movie isn’t Jacobs’ only connection to Who. His father, Anthony Jacobs, starred as Doc Holliday in a 1960s Doctor Who story set in the wild west, and, as Jacobs begins to open up about his difficult relationship with his parents, the documentary bends towards a journey of discovery. Yuille says it made sense to have the documentary explore who Jacobs was, as he was “unpacking his past and moving from one city to the next, sort of like a rebirth or regeneration himself”, in parallel with the journey taken by McGann’s Doctor in the film. And their own verdicts on the TV movie now, in 2022? “I think it’s fun. It has a lot of energy. I didn’t see what the big deal was about the kiss, and I thought Paul was wonderful,” says Yuille. “I always stand by it,” Jacobs says. “I’m not ashamed of it in any way.” Doctor Who Am I will premiere at the Sci-Fi London film festival on 21 May.

5/21/2022,"Tarik Saleh is the Swedish-Egyptian director who made The Nile Hilton Incident in 2017, a shrewd, dyspeptic movie about the official corruption in Egypt that triggered the Tahrir Square uprising. Now in an era when the Arab spring has arguably become a bittersweet memory, he has brought to the Cannes competition this watchable conspiracy espionage-drama satirising the corruption of church and state. There’s an intriguing mix of scorn and paranoia here, together with a yearning for individual figures of decency halfway down the food chain – it reminded me of John le Carré. Adam (Tawfeek Barhom) is a fisherman’s son in the northern town of Manzala who is overjoyed to receive news from his local imam that he is getting a lavish state sponsorship to study Islamic thought at Cairo’s internationally prestigious Al-Azhar University. This is a dizzying honour. Once at the university, he is overawed by the discipline, the rigour and the atmosphere of piety but disconcerted also when a fellow student offers him a cigarette – of all the louche things – and invites him out for a secular night on the town. Their seat of learning is stunned when its ageing chief imam drops dead of a heart attack while addressing the student body, and straight away there is political jockeying from the other imams as to who is take over a position of enormous political influence. Adam’s own bewilderment and distress is compounded when he witnesses his new student pal being murdered by masked assailants, and soon he is contacted by a dishevelled and cynical intelligence agent, Colonel Ibrahim (played by Fares Fares, the cop in The Nile Hilton Incident) who makes something horribly clear. Adam’s dead pal was an informant being “run” by the state security apparatus, covertly reporting back to the government on the imams’ subversive political views. This dead young man, like Adam himself, was the recipient of a state scholarship given to obedient provincials who will take orders from their real masters. Now Adam must work as a spy to ensure that the government’s favoured candidate gets the top job and if things go wrong there is no guarantee Adam won’t wind up like his friend. Saleh creates very tense scenes in which Adam has to further infiltrate various cliques and in-crowds at the university, get their trust and assuage their suspicions by conniving in violent acts against their enemies – and all this in a seat of religious learning. It’s a movie that is boldly anti-clerical, juxtaposing the spectacle of faith with a hidden reality of corruption and hypocrisy – although in the final act I sensed that it perhaps did not quite have the courage of its satirical convictions. The religious authorities in Egypt may be mollified by this film’s final implication that the secular state is marginally more institutionally corrupt than the religious establishment. It’s a bold piece of work nonetheless.

5/21/2022,"Senior Russian officials have proposed a new law that would eliminate age limits for military contract soldiers, in another sign the country is facing a shortage of infantry to continue its offensive in Ukraine. Two members of the ruling United Russia party who introduced the law said the move would enable the military to utilise the skills of older professionals. “For the use of high-precision weapons, the operation of weapons and military equipment, highly professional specialists are needed. Experience shows that they become such by the age of 40-45,” it said. Currently, Russians aged 18-40 and foreigners aged 18-30 can enter into a first contract with the army. The lawmakers added that the proposed legislation would also make it easier to recruit civilian medics, engineers and operations and communications specialists. Military experts say Russia is facing unsustainable troop and equipment losses in Ukraine after a series of military setbacks that have forced Moscow to reduce its war aims. Russia initially put about 80% of its main ground combat forces – 150,000 men – into the war in February, according to western officials. In the 82 days since, it has “suffered losses of one third of the ground combat force it committed,” British military intelligence claimed last week. The Russian military has also faced issues of low morale among its troops, as reports have emerged that hundreds of troops are unwilling to fight in what Russia calls its “special military operation”. “Russia lacks sufficient ground units with contract soldiers for a sustainable rotation. The troops are getting exhausted – they won’t be able to keep this up for a long period,” said Rob Lee, a military analyst. Despite widespread speculation and warnings by western intelligence, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has so far opted against ordering a large-scale military draft and formally declaring war on Ukraine, possibly fearing the repercussions such measures would have at home. Instead, the Russian authorities have quietly stepped up their efforts to recruit new contract soldiers. An investigation by the BBC’s Russian service showed that Russia’s defence ministry filled employment websites with vacancies, offering people with no combat experience opportunities to join the army on lucrative short-term contracts. Some large government-run companies have received letters urging them to sign up their staff for the army. The Guardian has also previously reported on how authorities in the pro-Russian Donbas region have organised an aggressive mobilisation campaign, forcing many men to go into hiding to avoid being sent to the frontline. Separately on Friday, Putin posthumously awarded the former rebel warlord Arseny Pavlov, also known as “Motorola”, with the Order of Courage. Motorola, a former veteran of the second Chechen war, was one of the first Russians who crossed into Ukraine to join the pro-Russian rebel movement in 2014, where he led the Sparta battalion, known as one of the more ruthless and ill-disciplined of the militia formations. Motorola has previously boasted of killing 15 Ukrainian soldiers. He died in murky circumstances in 2016 from a powerful bomb apparently planted in his apartment block’s lift. Russia has always denied its role in the Donbas, where war has been raging since 2014, despite evidence collected by journalists and NGO’s that Russia’s military was deployed in the region.",News/World news,Russia may scrap age limits for soldiers to bolster Ukraine invasion force,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/russia-may-scrap-age-limits-for-soldiers-to-bolster-ukraine-invasion-force

5/21/2022,"Doctors believe an unusual outbreak of acute hepatitis among children may have peaked in the UK, as work continues to understand the cause of the mysterious illness. Figures released on Friday by the UK Health Security Agency show that 197 children have been diagnosed with unexplained acute hepatitis this year, with 11 becoming so ill they needed a liver transplant. None in the UK have died. The health agency launched an investigation in April after hospitals reported a rise in cases of acute childhood hepatitis with no known cause. Typically, UK hospitals see about 20 cases a year that are not caused by common hepatitis viruses, but cases this year are nearly 10 times higher. The latest report from the UKHSA shows that while new cases are still coming to light, the rate appears to have slowed. “Potential reporting lags mean that the rate of new cases is uncertain, though the current rate is more consistent with plateauing than exponential growth,” it states. Scientists studying the outbreak suspect that adenovirus, a common infection that can cause colds, vomiting and diarrhoea, may be involved in the outbreak, but the virus does not normally cause hepatitis in otherwise healthy children. Tests on the sick children showed that 68% were positive for adenovirus, mostly in the blood. But levels of adenovirus and other respiratory viruses soared to unusually high levels in the spring as Covid restrictions eased, meaning infections were widespread in the general population. DNA studies are now under way to see whether the affected children have a genetic susceptibility to hepatitis, or whether the type of adenovirus identified in most children, known as adenovirus 41F, has mutated into a form that can trigger the disease in some children. One possibility is that an infection might provoke an abnormal immune response in some children, which attacks the liver tissue. “This could well be a very, very common infection by one virus, or more viruses, and the vast majority of us don’t even know we’ve had it, but there might be a genetic predisposition that means some children go on to get severe disease,” said Calum Semple, professor in child health and outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool. Tests on liver tissue from children who had transplants have not revealed a direct cause of the damage. Prof Semple said there is nothing to suggest that coronavirus, detected in 15% of cases, is directly involved, though an indirect effect has not been ruled out. There is no link to coronavirus vaccines. The majority of cases are in children under five years old, who are too young to receive the jab. Will Irving, a professor of virology at the University of Nottingham, said the involvement of adenovirus is the “leading contender” but that many factors might be contributing to the wave of cases. The spring rise in cases may simply be more of what hospitals saw before, he added, with the increase driven by high levels of virus in the community. Although the UKHSA is still searching for the cause, the agency has ruled out a link with pet dogs. Questionnaires filled out by affected families found that about 70% of the children had contact with dogs, but “extended investigations” found nothing to suggest a problem. “There’s nothing to indicate a role of dogs with children with acute hepatitis,” said Prof Semple. “We can put that one to bed now.” Dr Tassos Grammatikopoulos, a consultant in paediatric hepatology and honorary senior lecturer at King’s College hospital, said there were still cases coming through, but the UK seemed to be on a downwards trend. “We seem to be past the peak,” he added.",News/Society,"Mystery childhood hepatitis outbreak in UK may have peaked, doctors say",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/20/mystery-childhood-hepatitis-outbreak-in-uk-may-have-peaked-doctors-say
5/21/2022,"A group of 40 politicians from 18 countries have told the UN high commissioner for human rights that she risks causing lasting damage to the credibility of her office if she goes ahead with a visit to China’s Xinjiang region next week. Michelle Bachelet is scheduled to visit Kashgar and Ürümqi in Xinjiang during her trip, which starts on Monday. Human rights organisations say China has forced an estimated 1 million or more people into internment camps and prisons in the region. The US and a number of other western countries have described China’s treatment of the Uyghur minority living there as genocidal, a charge Beijing calls the “lie of the century”. In a statement seen by the Guardian before its publication, the politicians from the InterParliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac) accused Beijing of organising a “Potemkin-style tour”. In particular, they said they feared the government would use the cover of coronavirus restrictions to prevent the visit from being as free as it needed to be. The group includes six politicians under Chinese government sanctions, including Reinhard Bütikofer, the German Green MEP and chair of the European parliament’s China delegation; Helena Kennedy, the Labour peer; and Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative party leader. The politicians highlighted the UN terms of reference for such visits, which specify that the commissioner should be given freedom of movement, conversations with people active in civil society and confidential and unsupervised access to witnesses, all of which could be undermined by China’s crackdown in the region and its Covid-19 restrictions. As such, they said, it was hard to envisage a scenario where a meaningful visit could be achieved. Bachelet has demanded unfettered access on what will be the first visit to China by a human rights chief since 2005. It follows intense negotiations with the Chinese government lasting months over the terms of her access. Rights groups have cautioned that the terms of the visit have not been disclosed and voiced concern that Chinese authorities, who have always said they were only interested in a “friendly visit”, could manipulate the trip. Alleged human rights abuses in the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region include forced labour, forced sterilisation and the arbitrary detention of at least a million Uyghur Muslims. Beijing has vehemently denied all these allegations and blamed “anti-China forces” for stoking controversy. Ipac said: “The scale and severity of the persecution of Uyghurs and other minorities is exceptionally well documented. Indeed, the high commissioner herself has prepared a report into the situation which remains unpublished, despite assurances in December 2021 that it would be released ‘within a few weeks’. The stakes are therefore very high. “Should the high commissioner fail to obtain the necessary access for a meaningful investigation, the credibility of the office could suffer lasting damage, and the ability for the UNHCHR to secure meaningful future investigations may well be compromised. Covid restrictions must not be deployed as a reason to excuse the PRC [People’s Republic of China] for failing to allow a meaningful investigation.” Activists say China has violated human rights “on a scope and scale unimaginable” since the then UN human rights commissioner, Louise Arbour, visited more than a decade ago. “[This is] partly because there is no fear of accountability,” said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. “The high commissioner needs to work to end, not enable, that perception.” According to Bachelet’s official schedule, she will meet civil society organisations, business representatives and academics in China. She will also deliver a lecture to students at Guangzhou University. An advance team was sent to China late last month and completed a lengthy quarantine in the country, which is in the midst of another coronavirus outbreak. Bachelet will not need to quarantine upon arrival. Her office said she would not travel to Beijing because of Covid-19 restrictions. At the end of her mission a statement will be issued, and she is scheduled to hold a press conference on 28 May. No international journalists will be allowed to travel with her. Bachelet’s trip will be closely followed by Beijing as well as by the international community. Last week, in a report to Congress, the US state department outlined plans to intensify pressure on China to end what it called “horrific abuses” of Uyghur and other minority ethnic people in Xinjiang.",News/World news,UN human rights commissioner criticised over planned Xinjiang visit,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/un-human-rights-commissioner-xinjiang-michelle-bachelet-criticised
5/21/2022,"A trip to the mall in Russia is a different experience today than it was just a few short months ago. “When I had my first child, there was all this choice. Mothercare, Zara, you name it,” said Evgenia Marsheva, a 33-year-old architect. But when she went shopping in Moscow this month for her newborn, many of those large retail brands had been shuttered. “Now, I can only find very cheap or extremely expensive Russian products. I was brought up with tales of the limited choices that my parents had during the Soviet Union. I never thought that would come back.” Three months into the war, Russia has become the most sanctioned country in the world, and almost 1,000 foreign brands – the majority of them voluntarily – have curtailed their operations there, according to records kept by the Yale School of Management. The exodus of companies continued this week with McDonald’s officially announcing it would leave Russia after three decades. Helped by surging prices for oil and gas exports, the Kremlin has so far been able to continue financing its war efforts, with the country spending as much as $300m (£240m) a day on defence last month, double that of the prewar period, according to finance ministry data. Meanwhile, capital controls that Russia imposed to shield its financial sector in late February have made the rouble the world’s best-performing currency. Yet, for many in Moscow and other Russian cities, the country’s growing political and economic isolation is having a direct impact on their livelihoods. “Since the conflict started, every step in the production line is a struggle,” said Vladimir Kukushkin, a director of a printing company in Ekaterinburg, Russia’s fourth-largest city. Kukushkin complained that after Adobe announced that its software would not be available in Russia, he had to find new ways to design his products, while the rising prices of ink and paper have placed further strain on his business. “It has also been hard to promote my business because Instagram and Facebook are blocked. These might look like little things but they really add up,” he said. After Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, the Kremlin saw some successes in its import-substitution drive, particularly boosting its domestic agricultural production, and the owners of two restaurants in Moscow said they had not experienced any problems getting their products since the start of the war. However, the current exodus of firms had put a new spotlight on the country’s failures to produce many of the consumer goods Russians had grown accustomed to, said Maria Shagina, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “The Russian economy is still hugely dependent on imports. For example, 90% of bakeries in Russia run on imported, primarily European, equipment. The drop in imports will have a huge impact on the products available in the country,” she said. It would be especially difficult for Russian companies to replace foreign technology products and microchips, Shagina added. Russia’s efforts to copy banned social media platforms have been met with ridicule, while sanctions have sent the car industry back to the 1980s, with new cars no longer legally obliged to have airbags, which cannot now be imported from the west. In a glaring admission of the country’s struggles to replace products, Andrei Klishas, a senator from Putin’s ruling United Russia party, said this week that the country’s import substitution programme “has failed completely”. Recent economic data further points to signs of strain emerging across the economy. According to estimates by officials, the Russian economy is expected to contract by between 8 and 12% in 2022. Car sales, an indicator often used by experts to measure the economic mood, fell by almost 80% in April, the largest drop on record. Meanwhile, the country’s central bank has predicted an inflation rate between 18 and 23% this year. In a recent survey by the independent Levada Center, 85% of Russians polled said now was a bad time for big purchases, the highest level in more than a decade, while more than 60% of Russians said they had no savings. “The government has created a false sense of stability. But the long-term picture is damning,” said Shagina. While the slow-burning sanctions might not force Vladimir Putin to change his actions in Ukraine, the pressure on the Kremlin would rise “dramatically” if the European Union proceeded with its plans to decouple from Russian oil and gas, she said. “As long as Russia has its revenues from gas and oil it can sustain the war. It will be a huge blow to the Kremlin if they lose that cash cow.” And while economists and businesses raise alarm over the looming recession in the country, some Muscovites lament the broken cultural ties with the west that have come hand in hand with the economic damage. “The cultural isolation is maybe even scarier for me than the economic one,” said Katya Fedorova, a former fashion editor who now runs a widely read lifestyle and fashion blog on Telegram. Disney, Warner, Sony and other production companies have halted the release of films in Russia, with Moscow cinemas now re-running old Hollywood blockbusters and premiering Chinese action movies. “We will be lucky if we make it till autumn without shutting down. People simply don’t want to go to see The Wolf of Wall Street for the fifth time,” said the manager of a popular cinema in central Moscow, referring to the 2013 Martin Scorsese movie that is currently being reshown on some screens in the capital. In a symbolic move, Cosmopolitan, which caused a furore in 1994 when it became the first international women’s magazine to be published in post-Soviet Russia, was forced to change its name to Cosmagazine, after the Hearst Corporation revoked the magazine’s Russian licence. “I remember summers spent in Moscow hopping from an exhibition by Juergen Teller to one by Murakami, dancing at music festivals where the international lineups would rival the best European concerts,” Fedorova recalled. Western fashion executives would marvel when she took them around town, commenting on how “modern and happening” the city was. “That Moscow is gone now,” she sighed.",News/World news,Cosmopolitan no more: Russians feel sting of cultural and economic rift,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/russians-feel-sting-of-cultural-and-economic-rift-sanctions-ukraine
5/21/2022,"Brentford can reflect on an expertly navigated first Premier League season, in which they sit 11th. That is two places lower than Leeds’ finish in 2020-21 and they will want to avoid mimicking what came next for Jesse Marsch’s side. The equation for Leeds is simple: they must get a positive result and hope Burnley gain fewer points than them at home to Newcastle. Survival is not in their hands and Marsch may rush Patrick Bamford back from injury in order to help them complete their side of the bargain.
