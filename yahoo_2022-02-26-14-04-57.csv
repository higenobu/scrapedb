2/26/2022,"Sanctions against Russia may not achieve their aim of forcing Vladimir Putin back to the negotiating table if his forces succeed in achieving their military objective before the country feels the economic pain. Russia may be enfeebled by years of dependence on commodity exports, yet the Kremlin has fattened itself on the proceeds of last year’s inflationary boom in energy prices. That means it’s now in a prime position to weather reprisals designed to sap his fiscal ability to wage war. “We will weaken Russia’s economic base and its capacity to modernize, and in addition we will freeze Russian assets in the European Union,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned on Thursday only hours after Putin launched combat operations. Waves of increasingly punishing financial sanctions imposed by Western allies may ultimately take too much time to unfold their full effect—valuable time Ukraine may not have. “President Putin’s decision to escalate the military confrontation into a war suggests a willingness to accept near-term economic pain in favor of securing long-term geopolitical goals,” wrote Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of global wealth management at UBS on Thursday. At first glance, Russia seems like an easy sanctions target given its calcified and uncompetitive economy that lives off exports harvested from the fields or mined out of the ground. Wealth inequality creates deep fissures in its society, vaccination hesitancy is rampant, and life expectancy at birth ranks just 159th in the world. “Russia continues to face relatively low potential growth, which, unless addressed, will impede the ability of the country to achieve high development goals, raising incomes and living standards,” wrote the World Bank in its latest country report published in December. Michael Hüther, director of the economic think tank IW in Cologne, Germany, argued the manufactured crisis in Ukraine offered Putin the chance to deflect from domestic problems such as its glacial pace of innovation and reliance on foreign imports of electronics, machinery, and other durable goods. “The path towards commercial independence from commodity exports is a very long one,” he wrote in an op-ed on Wednesday. “Russia is economically far weaker than it itself feels politically and projects militarily.” But despite its antiquated industry and dilapidated infrastructure, Russia may be better prepared than ever to weather the sanctions, crippling as they might be. First off, the country enjoys vast resources at its disposal, making it the world’s largest exporter of natural gas and wheat. And it’s likely no coincidence that the military offensive in Ukraine coincides with historically high energy prices, which have filled Russia’s coffers over previous months and given it an economic cushion. While many developed nations remain addicted to foreign capital to finance their consumption, Russia has proved it is more than capable of living within its means. At $82 billion in September, Russia’s current account surplus reached its highest since the global financial crisis, and its fiscal debt sits at just 16% of GDP, paltry compared with the euro area’s 98% figure at the end of the third quarter. Meanwhile, Russia continued last year to decouple itself financially from the global reserve currency system by accumulating more gold in its central bank vaults than it holds in U.S. dollars. According to the World Gold Council, stores of nearly 2,300 metric tons at the end of November are the fifth largest in the world after the U.S., Germany, Italy, and France. Putin’s Central Bank of Russia (CBR) also said it was “ready to take all necessary measures to maintain financial stability,” announcing forbearance measures on key balance sheet solvency metrics lasting until October to prop up any credit institutions that may see access to capital via interbank lending markets severed. According to UBS estimates, the CBR also holds some $640 billion in foreign exchange reserves, and could afford to pause further interventions to prop up the ruble. Furthermore Russia’s sovereign debt is largely impervious to attack from bond market vigilantes thanks to the share of foreign creditors falling below 20%. Finally the government always has the option to release some of its funds tied up in the National Welfare Fund, which bunkers proceeds from its petroleum industry for a rainy day. Its liquid assets alone equate to no less than 7% of the country’s gross domestic product. This puts the Kremlin in an enviable position compared with 2014 during its first land grab when it captured Crimea, Ukraine’s pro-Russian enclave on the Black Sea. That isn’t to say the icy frost of sanctions won’t put the chill on Russian risk assets. The MOEX benchmark tracking the country’s blue chips had already suffered heavy losses this week before halving in value on Thursday to plumb depths not seen since the start of 2016. With stock market prices plunging, Bloomberg reported sources as saying Putin has called major shareholders and the leaders of Russia’s biggest companies to the Kremlin to discuss the situation in Ukraine. Michael Roth, head of the German parliament’s foreign affairs committee, said the best hope for causing pain to Putin will not be making life miserable for the average Russian on the street. Instead the West needed to expand their campaign against the wealthy benefactors of Putin’s economic system, only a handful of which have been singled out thus far. Prominent individuals like Roman Abramovich have escaped sanctions, and one even enjoys a cushy lifetime appointment to the U.K.’s House of Lords. “Our sanctions must above all target Putin’s system of oligarchy,” said Roth. “We have to drain the resources from all those millionaires and billionaires that enriched themselves in his shadow and now enjoy privileges like sending their kids to schools in the West, buying luxury flats in Berlin and London, and going on ski holidays to Austria.” Maybe then Putin can be forced back to the negotiating table.

2/26/2022,"(Bloomberg) — Russia’s wealthiest individuals were already feeling the squeeze from escalating tensions between the nation and Ukraine. Most Read from Bloomberg Taiwan to Join in U.S.-Led Sanctions on Russia: Ukraine Update Russia Invasion of Ukraine Ignites European Security Crisis Russia Hits Airfields; Kyiv Imposes Martial Law: Ukraine Update Stocks Rise as Oil Pares Gain After Biden Address: Markets Wrap Six Early Thoughts on Russia's Invasion of Ukraine It got much worse for their net worth after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine. In less than 24 hours, they lost $39 billion — more than they had up to that point this year. The damage was across asset classes. Russia’s benchmark MOEX Russia Index closed 33% lower in Moscow, the fifth-worst plunge in stock market history in local currency terms. It marked the first time since 1987’s Black Monday crash that a decline of that magnitude hit a market worth more than $50 billion. UBS Group AG, meantime, triggered margin calls on some wealth management clients that use Russian bonds as collateral for their portfolios after cutting the lending value of some debt from the country to zero, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News. The Swiss wealth manager says it caters to half of the world’s billionaires. One of the worst security crises in Europe since World War II threatens to deepen market declines in the region, but especially in Russia, which has been hit with sanctions by the U.S. and U.K. A handful of billionaires, including Gennady Timchenko, are also subject to penalties for their ties to Putin, though there are calls for widening the potential targets. Read more: Here Are the Russian Billionaires Facing Sanctions Over Ukraine “There are a lot of people in the U.S. and Europe who want to hit them directly,” Chris Miller, co-director of the Russia and Eurasia program at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, said of Russian billionaires in an interview. “I don’t think there’s any good news in the sanctions for them.” Vagit Alekperov, the chairman of Lukoil, saw the sharpest decline in his net worth. It was slashed by almost a third in a day, falling by about $6.2 billion to $13 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Shares of the Moscow-based oil producer slumped about 33% on Thursday. Alexey Mordashov, chairman of the steelmaker Severstal, lost $4.2 billion on Thursday, bringing his fortune to $23 billion. Vladimir Potanin, president of Norilsk Nickel and currently Russia’s richest person, lost $3 billion. Alekperov and Timchenko have each lost about $10 billion this year, or more than 40% of their fortunes. Those are the biggest percentage declines among the Russian billionaires tracked by the Bloomberg wealth index.

2/26/2022,"The era of remote work will set you free. At least that's how the promise goes. But what if it creates a new class of high-earning remote workers, worsening wealth inequality along the way? What if it just feeds into a harmful dynamic called the “superstar effect,” which has plagued the American economy since the 1990s? Be careful what you wish for when it comes to remote work, in other words. That's what Dror Poleg, an economic historian, thinks. Poleg has written extensively on the topic of how technology impacts the way we work and live. In a trending thread on Twitter, he laid out why he thinks that we might see a dramatic shift in the way people are paid as we move to remote work. You may already know about the superstar effect: Think of Michael Jordan, arguably the greatest basketball player of all time, or GOAT, in modern parlance. Poleg theorizes that remote work could make someone in your office the Michael Jordan of your field, and remote work could free that person up to cash in and make a lot more money than you. In his Twitter thread, Poleg points out that creative industries are marked by structural inequities that are less apparent in white-collar professions. For example, the stark differences in pay in the entertainment industry are obvious if you look at the average salary of the many performers trying to make it compared with the few A-list stars like George Clooney or Jennifer Aniston, who bring in millions per project. https://twitter.com/drorpoleg/status/1496528582641868800 Poleg offers a few reasons why our shift to remote work could lead to a group of elite white-collar employees. For one, companies are no longer forced to hire talent near a central office, which means they can choose from a wider pool of talent. “In a small[er] pool, employees face less competition and are less likely to encounter ‘outlier’ competitors who are 50 times better than them,” Poleg tweeted. And with so many white-collar employees working from home, office culture becomes less important. Poleg argues that in the past, office workers (and their managers) were of the mindset that time spent at the office is arguably more important than the quality of the work. When a job is done remotely, it’s almost impossible to give credit simply for showing up. As a result, managers with a remote workforce are more likely to put an emphasis on the quality of the employee's output. In this environment, productivity rather than presence is important, and low performers have more of a chance of falling behind, Poleg says. Distracting meetings and long commutes end up punishing the highest performers when they work in an office, he continues. Working from home allows them to be more productive when they can hone their skills and focus on their individual contributions. Meetings are often set up in part to create a sense of community or team-bonding, but they are also derided for being time sucks. These office time-wasters will fall by the wayside, giving individuals even more time to focus on their work. Of course, not everyone who works from home finds it conducive to productivity. Many working parents find themselves trying to juggle their jobs and kids. Lower-income workers might struggle to find a quiet place to do their jobs. And nearly every remote employee has had a day when their internet connection failed right when they needed to hop on to an important Zoom. But employees who are the most productive will find the greatest success in this new work culture, according to Poleg. In the remote-first working world, standout performers will be celebrated (and paid) like superstar athletes, since teamwork will be valued less than individual success. Poleg warns in his Twitter thread that a world devoid of office culture could lead to even more pronounced economic inequality. Employees who share the same space are typically offered similar perks and work-related benefits. With everyone working from home, Poleg argues, it will be easier for executives to justify compensating employees at drastically different levels. “When everyone is in the same place, it's hard to pay one programmer 20 times more than the person sitting next to them,” Poleg tweeted. https://twitter.com/drorpoleg/status/1496528585410109443 Though more companies are starting to pressure employees to return to the office at least part-time, it’s unlikely that we’ll ever see a full return-to-office culture. “Once companies discover the benefits of hiring from a larger pool, there's no going back. To remain competitive, most companies will have to adopt some level of remote and flexible work,” Poleg tweeted. https://twitter.com/drorpoleg/status/1496528586320322564 But while employees think having the freedom and flexibility to work remotely gives them all the power, it might backfire if it ultimately means the end of the middle class.

2/26/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Just over a year ago, international oil markets dismissed Venezuela as a catastrophe too beaten down and too mismanaged ever to regain relevance. Turns out, the death notice was quite premature. Most Read from Bloomberg Russia Invasion of Ukraine Ignites European Security Crisis Russia Hits Airfields; Kyiv Imposes Martial Law: Ukraine Update Zelenskiy Says Russia Trying to Seize Chernobyl: Ukraine Update Stocks Pare Losses, Oil Surges on Russia Assault: Markets Wrap The $200 Billion Club Loses Last Member as Elon Musk’s Wealth Tumbles With crude prices spiking to over $100 per barrel and traders scrutinizing far-flung corners of the globe for signs of future production, Venezuela’s oil industry is mounting an unexpected recovery at the most opportune time. The founding OPEC member—home to the world’s largest oil reserves—has more than doubled production since late 2020, and there’s even more room for output to grow. Global economies are bouncing back from the worst of the pandemic and the market is on edge over the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and so hungry buyers are gladly purchasing all the fuel they can get. It’s a comeback that until recently seemed almost unthinkable. The state-run driller, Petroleos de Venezuela SA, already in dire straits after decades of mismanagement, has absorbed one blow after another: financial sanctions from the U.S. in 2017; another round two years later that disrupted trading of its oil and forced contractors on the ground to pull back; an electricity blackout that took production offline for a week; the loss of oil storage in the Caribbean; and a global pandemic that sent prices for its heavy crude tumbling. The petrostate’s foreign currency revenues shrank a whopping 99% in the six years ending in early 2021 in a massive hit for the economy. But Venezuela has recently worked out a new formula: importing light-oil from Iran to help it thin out its thick crude, working with local contractors to keep the oil flowing and selling it to China through middlemen. As a result, PDVSA is now producing about 800,000 barrels a day, around 60% of what it pumped before the U.S. oil sanctions went into effect in January 2019. It’s not the 3 million barrels a day that made Venezuela a global energy force in the 1990s, but neither is it the 374,000 barrels a day it hit when the country was at rock bottom in June 2020. With prices surging in recent weeks and some local contractors perceiving the Biden administration as less stringent when it comes to enforcing economic sanctions, many analysts believe it’s a production level that the country can sustain. To be sure, 800,000 barrels a day is less than 10% of Saudi Arabia’s output and wouldn’t even make Venezuela a top producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. But while it will barely make a ripple internationally, it’s an important lifeline for President Nicolas Maduro, providing oxygen to an economy that just grew for the first time in seven years. PDVSA does not publish financial data, but Asdrubal Oliveros, from Caracas-based consultancy Ecoanalitica, estimates the government received $11 billion in oil revenue last year, a 38% increase from the previous year. He forecasts revenue will grow to around $15 billion this year. The company did not reply to messages seeking comment. Venezuela’s supply is not “going to move markets, but with oil prices rising, they represent a windfall revenue for Maduro,” David Voght, managing director of IPD Latin America, said in an interview. One key factor fueling the turnaround is the help of powerful allies. China buys the majority of Venezuela’s production and Iran provides the condensate the country needs to mix with its heavy crude. The diluent is key to the Orinoco Belt. The tar-like crude drilled in the wide open plains in eastern Venezuela makes up around 70% of the country’s output; without condensate to mix with it, it can’t be pumped to PDVSA’s exporting port 300 kilometers away, as it clogs pipelines. “Access to Iranian diluents is key for production to continue to ramp up,” said Jacques Rousseau, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners LLC. “With oil prices so high and dwindling supplies of the type of heavy oil Venezuela produces, it’s certainly worth it to pay more attention to what they are doing.” Just this week, Caracas and Tehran broadened their oil cooperation with a new deal in Doha, during the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, without detailing its content. PDVSA has also overcome the exodus of big international service and maintenance companies, such as Halliburton Co., Schlumberger and Baker Hughes Co., that pulled from the country as U.S. sanctions prohibited them from drilling wells or selling, buying or transporting oil. In their place, local contractors are increasingly filling the void, quietly stepping in to do repairs and maintenance. The willingness of such companies to take on contracts has come about due, in part, to the hands-off approach of the Biden administration to sanctions, contractors operating in the country say. Under the softer approach, they say the U.S. is not closing down their access to financial institutions with the same voracity as the Trump administration. The Treasury Department didn’t respond to a request for comment. Related: Chevron in Talks Seeking More Control of Venezuela Operation For now, production is holding, even as many facilities are in ruin, Voght said. PDVSA has so much excess capacity that it can focus on plants that are in better shape to keep pumping near current levels. At the same time, many of the fields that have been shut down can quickly be reopened, meaning possibly there’s room for it to grow. Despite the sanctions and the quality of Venezuela’s crude, “it is operating as best it can and with great effort to sustain production in the worst conditions,” said economist Tamara Herrera, managing director of consulting firm Sintesis Financiera. Still, that doesn’t mean Maduro’s ambitious 1.5 million-barrel-a-day goal is within reach. “After years of lack of investments,” Clearview Energy’s Rousseau said, “it’s unlikely that output will go back to once it was.” Herrera agreed. “Touching it and sustaining it are two different things,” she said of the elevated output levels. “The main challenge for the industry is to make the levels achieved sustainable.” (Updates with oil price in second paragraph) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek A Pandemic Baby Bump Shines a Spotlight on the Nordic Welfare Model Removing Résumés From Hiring Process Can Improve Diversity Wall Street Is Buying Starter Homes to Quietly Become America’s Landlord Elon Musk’s Boring Company Plots Texas Tunnels The Abortion Pill Is Safer Than Tylenol and Almost Impossible to Get ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•2 days ago,Venezuela’s Diminished Oil Industry Mounts an Unlikely Recovery,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/venezuela-diminished-oil-industry-mounts-130017492.html
2/26/2022,"As Russia launches a war against Ukraine, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) — down more than 3% at Thursday's open — mounted a furious comeback, with megacap stocks Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) doing much of the heavy lifting. However, the eight largest U.S. publicly traded companies have hemorrhaged over $2 trillion in market capitalization since their combined value peaked in mid-November. According to one Wall Street strategist, the geopolitical maelstrom may give bottom-fishing investors the opportunity to start nibbling at beaten-down stocks. The combined market cap of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta Platforms (FB), Nvidia (NVDA), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) surged 168% from the pandemic low — from $4.3 trillion to a peak of $11.7 trillion on Nov. 19. Shortly thereafter, Apple would briefly top $3 trillion in value — but tantalizingly, it was never able to settle over that milestone valuation. As inflation picked up sharply in the fourth quarter, U.S. Treasury yields across the curve (^FVX, ^TNX, ^TYX) surged higher. However, the shorter maturities gained more quickly than the long end — flattening the yield curve. In early January, investors woke up to the most hawkish Federal Reserve in 40 years, along with economic data rolling in on the toll the Omicron variant was taking on spending and the labor market, as vast swaths of workers called in sick for weeks. This set the stage for the messy year investors have faced so far — with pricey growth companies and financial stocks flagging as the yield curve flattens. In the S&P 500 (^GSPC), only the energy sector has advanced this year — up over 20%. That's as WTI crude oil (CL=F) finally hit north of $100/bbl — for the first time since mid-2014. This year alone, the average megacap stock is returning a loss of 17.6%, with Meta leading the way down — off 41.0% — thanks to a major earnings disappointment. But even Alphabet, which popped 7.5% after a big earnings beat, is down 12% this year. Tesla and Nvidia are each off by more than 20%. Yet despite the carnage, investors are on the lookout for signs of selling capitulation to mark a potential bottom. DailyFX.com Senior Strategist Christopher Vecchio joined Yahoo Finance Live early Thursday as the Nasdaq opened down nearly 3.5%. To help find signs of a bottom, Vecchio said investors should look to see elevated fear levels in the market as expressed by the CBOE Volatility Index (^VIX) and the CBOE VVIX Index (^VVIX). ""During other market sell-off episodes, two things have popped out that suggest we're nearing an exhaustion point. That would be [the] VIX above 35, and VVIX — the volatility of the volatility index — moving above 150. We didn't see that yesterday. It's likely that we're going to see that today,"" said Vecchio. By midday Thursday, the VIX had peaked at nearly 38, and the VVIX had topped out at 145. Vecchio is also looking at some of the broader index levels falling into territory not seen since last year — giving some confidence to dip a toe in the investing waters again on a short-term basis. ""Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are coming into some technically significant levels — really going back to the May 2021 lows. And I do think that at that point in time, given the specter of this sell-off, it becomes sensible from a risk-reward standpoint — at least try to cherry pick a short-term bottom,"" he said. EvercoreISI tech analyst Mark Mahaney shared a similar sentiment on Yahoo Finance Live Thursday, arguing that it makes sense to buy quality names at these levels — like Amazon and Google — if one's investment time frame is longer. ""If you have a 9 to 12 month outlook, you will be able to start off buying the highest quality names,"" said Mahaney. Vecchio stresses that Russia is only a catalyst against the backdrop of several larger market themes. ""This all ties back to what's happening with the Fed in March. Russia is an accelerant here, but the conditions are in place for weaker stocks. You have a decline in corporate earnings, a weaker growth environment and of course record high inflation."" Analysts have been quick to point out that the Fed is less likely to front-load the monetary tightening process against the new geopolitical backdrop. Vecchio believes the Fed will hike its benchmark rate in March by only 25 basis points instead of 50 bps — regardless of the final inflation numbers that are released before the meeting. ""[U]ltimately given the scale of the decline we've seen thus far — looking into those May 2021 lows — it is a stopping point for further bleeding,"" said Vecchio, referring to the price action in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq early Thursday.
