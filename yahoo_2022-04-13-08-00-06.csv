4/13/2022,"Patrick Ho hardly seemed the profile of a big-time international fixer. A short, pudgy man, affectionately known to friends as “Fat Ping,” Ho had been a Harvard-trained ophthalmologist and a Hong Kong government minister. Yet in the fall of 2017, after landing at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City, he was arrested by FBI agents and charged in an audacious plot to dole out millions of dollars in bribes to African leaders in exchange for major energy contracts that appeared to advance Chinese government interests. What emerged in his indictment and later trial and conviction in federal court was a revealing portrait of Chinese influence peddling that included allegations that Ho arranged to broker arms deals — including the sale of rocket and grenade launchers — to countries in war zones in Africa and the Middle East. There was one noteworthy detail, however, about Ho’s global wheeling and dealing that went unmentioned in federal court documents or Justice Department press releases at the time. During the same period that he was being pursued by the FBI for his role in the global bribery scheme, Ho and his boss, Ye Jianming, a billionaire oil tycoon with past ties to a front for the People’s Liberation Army, had entered into a business relationship with two members of the Biden family — President Biden’s son Hunter Biden and the president’s brother, James Biden. As Yahoo News first reported, when Ho was arrested by agents at JFK, the first call he made was to James Biden. (The president’s brother later told the New York Times that he believed the call was intended for his nephew Hunter.) At the time, Ho’s connection to the Bidens was unclear. But emails on a damaged laptop that Hunter Biden left at a computer repair store in Wilmington, Del. — many of which have since been authenticated by the Washington Post and the Times — as well as bank records and other documents uncovered by Senate Republican investigators, reveal a high-dollar money trail that flowed from Chinese interests to Hunter and James Biden and which now appears to be at the heart of an ongoing Justice Department criminal investigation. (George Mesires, a lawyer for both Hunter and James Biden, did not respond to requests for comment from Yahoo News. A lawyer for Ho declined to comment.) The documents show that over a 14-month period in 2017 and 2018, a Chinese firm, CEFC China Energy, which was founded by Ye and whose nonprofit wing was run by Ho, paid $4.8 million to an investment vehicle controlled by Hunter Biden. During that same time frame, Hunter Biden’s firm transferred $1.4 million to James Biden’s consulting firm, according to bank records and a report released by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, ranking minority member on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Moreover, in September 2017, just two months before the Chinese businessman’s arrest, Hunter Biden (who is a lawyer) signed a retainer agreement to represent Ho, according to emails found on his laptop and since authenticated by the Washington Post. Grassley separately obtained bank records showing $1 million was paid to Biden in March 2018 for the representation, although it is not clear what work, if any, he did for Ho. Court records of Ho’s criminal case show no indication that Biden or his law firm at the time, Boies Schiller Flexner, participated in Ho’s legal defense. (Among the questions that Yahoo News submitted to Mesires, the Bidens’ lawyer, were what work Hunter Biden did for the $1 million retainer and what work James Biden did for the $1.4 million paid to his consulting firm. He did not respond.) But there are indications that Hunter Biden had good reason to suspect the Chinese intelligence connections of Ho and Ye. In a May 11, 2018, audio recording of a conversation with an unidentified woman found on the laptop, a copy of which has been obtained by Yahoo News, Hunter Biden complained about getting a phone call from a New York Times reporter asking about his representation of Ho. He is “literally the f***ing spy chief of China,” Biden says to the woman, clearly overstating Ho’s role. (It is unclear why the conversation, which was recorded by the woman, was on the laptop.) In the same conversation, Biden also talked about phone calls he had gotten from his father about media inquiries into his business affairs. And he complains that Ye, who he refers to as “my partner” and “the richest man in the world” had recently gone missing in China and he was unable to get in touch with him. (Ye, who apparently ran afoul of Chinese President Xi Jinping, has not been publicly seen or heard from since.) None of the details about Hunter and James Biden’s business dealings with Chinese interests implicate President Biden in any wrongdoing. But the depth and breadth of the Bidens’ financial ties with Ho and Ye raise new questions as to whether they were targets of a Chinese influence operation that, separate and apart from an ongoing criminal probe into Hunter Biden for alleged tax fraud and potentially foreign lobbying violations, represents a counterintelligence threat. “There’s no question that Chinese intelligence services look for every possible opportunity to get close to family members of high-ranking officials,” said Frank Figliuzzi, former chief of the FBI’s counterintelligence division. In the past, Figliuzzi had expressed skepticism about stories in conservative media about Hunter Biden. But now, he adds, “I believe that the information we’ve learned is something that merits a review by the counterintelligence arm of the FBI.” (A FBI spokeswoman said the bureau would have no comment on whether it has initiated a counterintelligence inquiry into the Bidens’ Chinese connections similar to the one it launched into then candidate Donald Trump and his campaign in the summer of 2016.) There’s “no doubt Hunter presents CI [counterintelligence] vulnerabilities,” says another former senior FBI official, who asked not to be identified by name discussing sensitive matters relating to the Bidens. But those issues received less scrutiny during the Trump years because Trump and his own family had multiple business interests with foreign governments, which he used his power as president to bolster. “Trump and all the hangers-on were so bad that I think some legitimate questions about Hunter have been covered less rigorously than they should have been,” said the former official. Still, if Trump’s children such as Donald Trump Jr. or Eric Trump were doing the same things, “many more people would be howling.” Alleged Chinese political influence schemes in the U.S. go back decades. In the 1990s, a campaign finance scandal known as “Chinagate” erupted over illicit donations by Chinese backers with ties to the country’s intelligence service to the Democratic National Committee and Bill Clinton’s 1996 reelection campaign. More recently, suspected Chinese agents have tried to sidle up to prominent politicians including California Democrats Sen.Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Eric Swalwell, prompting the FBI to give both lawmakers a “defensive briefing.” (After being alerted by the bureau, Feinstein fired the staffer alleged to be working for Chinese intelligence. Swalwell cut his ties to the suspected Chinese agent who had been raising money for his campaign.) Scions of prominent Republican families, like Neil Bush — son of former President George H.W. Bush and the brother of former President George W. Bush — have also been criticized for their connections to Chinese organizations running influence efforts. But a full picture of the Chinese business ties of the Bidens has only emerged in fits and starts, with much that is still unknown. Although many of the details have circulated in conservative media circles for some time, they were largely ignored by mainstream news organizations in part because they initially surfaced on a laptop that wound up, through circuitous means, in the hands of Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s lawyer who is prone to making factually dubious claims, and the accuracy of its contents was hard to verify. Playing on those concerns and the memory of the Russian hack-and-dump campaign that targeted 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, 51 former U.S. intelligence officials (many of whom had clashed with Trump and were publicly backing Biden) released a statement claiming that the email dump “has all the classic earmarks of a Russian influence operation.” The intel officials who signed the letter acknowledged they had no evidence of Russian involvement in the laptop, and none has surfaced since then. Still, signs of Hunter Biden’s efforts to do business in China — and his willingness to use his proximity to his father to further those deals — had been public for some time. In 2013, Hunter Biden accompanied his father, then the sitting vice president, aboard Air Force 2 on a trip to Beijing. While his father engaged in five-and-a-half hours of talks with Xi, the Chinese leader, the younger Biden met with Jonathan Li, a Chinese banker with whom he had just formed a Chinese private equity firm. (The Chinese business license for the firm was issued by Shanghai authorities 10 days after the trip and Hunter Biden was named a member of the board, according to NBC reporter Jonathan Lederman, then with the Associated Press, who accompanied the Bidens on the trip.) What became of that venture — and how much it netted Hunter Biden — is still fuzzy. But by 2017, as his father was starting to plot his campaign for president, Hunter Biden began forming new ventures with problematic new partners. He met with Ye, the chief of CEFC, for dinner in Miami and discussed a $40 million investment in a liquified natural gas venture in Louisiana, according to an account in the New Yorker. That summer, Ye also informed Hunter Biden that his deputy, Ho, was under criminal investigation by federal prosecutors in New York and asked the younger Biden to assist in his defense — a request that led to the $1 million retainer payment the following year. As those relationships solidified, the FBI was intensifying its pursuit of Ho. Court documents later revealed that the bureau had gotten a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant to secretly intercept Ho’s communications, an action the FBI can only be granted for targets suspected of being an agent of a foreign power or a terrorist organization. The case that prosecutors ultimately brought against Ho revolved around claims that he used CEFC’s U.S.-based nonprofit, the China Energy Fund Committee, to shell out $2.5 million in bribes to senior African officials to win oil contracts for Ye’s Shanghai-based energy conglomerate. Ho was not formally accused of acting on behalf of the Chinese government. But when it comes to Beijing’s influence operations, the line between freelancing businessmen and de facto agents of the state can be thin, sometimes by design, according to former U.S. intelligence officials. Indeed, Ho’s own defense lawyers argued that his actions were “in furtherance of the Chinese state’s agenda” by promoting Belt and Road, Xi’s signature initiative to expand Chinese economic power around the world through infrastructure investment. Besides his bribes, prosecutors also introduced evidence of other misdeeds by Ho. He had, they charged, sought to facilitate a sanctions-busting scheme on behalf of Iran, plotting with an Iranian agent how to wash frozen Iranian funds so Tehran could covertly purchase precious metals. He also sought to “leverage his connections and power” by brokering arms deals — including the sale of mortar rounds and rocket, anti-tank and grenade launchers — to Libya, Chad, South Sudan and Qatar, according to a sentencing memo filed by the prosecutors. Ho’s “actions were corrupt and they were criminal, and he knew it,” said Douglas Zolkind, an assistant U.S. attorney during the former Hong Kong minister’s trial at federal court in Manhattan. “That’s why he carried out these schemes from his perch as the head of a nonprofit NGO, where he could gain access to world leaders under the guise of someone interested in humanitarian goals.” Ho was convicted of seven counts for money laundering, conspiracy and foreign lobbying violations in December 2018 and sentenced to three years in federal prison.",Politics/Yahoo News,New Hunter Biden revelations raise counterintelligence questions,https://news.yahoo.com/new-hunter-biden-revelations-raise-counter-intelligence-questions-090046438.html
4/13/2022,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — A Polish government special commission has reinforced its earlier allegations that the 2010 plane crash that killed President Lech Kaczynski and 95 others in Russia was the result of Moscow's assassination plan. The latest of the commission’s reports, released Monday, alleges that an intentional detonation of planted explosives caused the April 10, 2010 crash of Soviet-made Tu-154M plane that killed Kaczynski, the first lady and 94 other government and armed forces figures as well as many prominent Poles. Their deaths were the result of an “act of unlawful interference by the Russian side,” the commission's head Antoni Macierewicz told a news conference. ""The main and indisputable proof of the interference was an explosion in the left wing ... followed by an explosion in the plane's center,"" said Macierewicz, who in 2015-2018 served as defense minister in Poland's right-wing government. He denied that any mistakes were made by the Polish pilots or crew members, despite bad weather at the time of the crash. The report repeats many previous allegations made by the commission, appointed by the government whose key figure is the main ruling Law and Justice party leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the twin of the late president. It comes at a time when Russia has unleashed a war on Poland’s neighbor Ukraine, and among the current tense relations between Warsaw and Moscow. Poland supports Ukraine in its struggle against Russia and is calling for very tough sanctions on Moscow for its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. The latest report once again drums up hostility toward Russia among some Poles, chiefly supporters of the nationalist government, it what seems to be an effort to consolidate the voter base of the Law and Justice party, which was founded by the Kaczynski twins in 2001. Suspicions are additionally fuelled by Russia's refusal to return the wreckage, which has complicated Poland's investigation. Earlier, two separate reports by Polish and Russian experts on aviation incidents said the crash on approach in dense fog to the Smolensk airport, which did not have sophisticated aviation equipment, was the result of human errors made in adverse weather conditions. They found no proof of foul play.",World/Associated Press,Polish panel: Russia behind Polish leader's plane crash,https://news.yahoo.com/polish-panel-russia-behind-polish-123442473.html
4/13/2022,"By John Irish PARIS (Reuters) -It was going to be bad. It turned out to be worse. Conservative Valerie Pecresse scored below 5% in the first round of the France's presidential election, the centre right's lowest score in modern history and one which threatens its survival. When the first projections flashed up as polling stations closed, stunned Pecresse supporters gasped: ""What now?"" Having failed to cross the vote threshold needed to ensure her campaign expenses were partly refunded, Pecresse on Monday asked for urgent donations by mid-May to save the party as it look towards the legislative elections in June. ""What is at the stake is the very survival of Les Republicains and beyond, the very survival of the Right,"" she said on arrival for an emergency party meeting. Only a decade ago, Nicolas Sarkozy was readying himself to run for a second mandate after almost 17 years of centre-right rule in France. Now, the Les Republicains party's existence is under threat after its voters turned to incumbent Emmanuel Macron, far-right challenger Marine Le Pen and extreme-right candidate Eric Zemmour, seeing no value in casting their ballots for the traditional right. The movement has struggled to remain relevant since Macron became president in 2017. He has been able to dynamite the Socialist party, which also got record low support on Sunday 10 years after Francois Hollande beat Sarkozy for the presidency in 2012, and capture a chunk of centre-right supporters as he promised a neither left nor right political offering. His economic policies overlap with theirs and as he has sought to siphon votes from the right by toughening his stance on security and immigration over the last 18 months, that has increasingly divided centre-right voters and politicians who have been unable to find a clear vision for their party. The party meeting decided there would be no votes for Le Pen in the runoff against Macron on April 24. Pecresse said in her defeat speech on Sunday she would vote for Macron. But highlighting the splits, 13 of the 115 political bureau members abstained and one voted against. Party president Christian Jacob told reporters after the meeting the party wanted to remain independent and united. ""We are neither interchangeable in Lepenism or Macronism,"" he said. LET COWARDS GO The divisions have been apparent long before Sunday's election. The president of the southeast region Renaud Muselier and Sarkozy's former Budget Minister Eric Woerth abandoned the party. Others defected to Le Pen. That lack of unity was again clear on Sunday night. While Pecresse and other heavyweights such as former Justice Minister Rachida Dati called for a Macron vote to block the far right in the runoff, others, such as the runner-up in the party primary Eric Ciotti, made it clear that he could not vote for him. An IPSOS poll looking at a rollover of votes for the second round showed a three way split in Pecresse's support to Macron, Le Pen and abstentions. ""We're paying ... because we have tried to position ourselves in the centre,"" Les Republicans lawmaker Julien Aubert said, adding that he would not vote for Macron. ""We are threatened with being reduced to almost nothing."" Secretary General Aurelien Pradie said the poor showing should clarify the way forward. ""The cowards will go to one side or the other. Let them go and leave it to the rest to come up with a political message,"" he said. For some party activists the immediate priority is June's legislative elections, when the party will look to save its 101 lawmakers. For others, it is more long-term - their eyes already on the next presidential race. ""I don’t think our party will collapse ... If Le Pen loses she is finished and if Macron wins it will be his last mandate so in 2027 there will be the need for something new and we will need to be ready,"" Florence Portelli, spokeswoman for Pecresse, said, adding that she did not want a rapprochement with Macron. Many of the party activists Reuters spoke to insisted that the party was not dead. Les Republicans still governs many of France's town halls and local authorities, giving it a political footprint that Macron's own party has struggled to build. The hope is that if Macron were to win on April 24, he would struggle to win a parliamentary majority. Some in the party believe he will need the centre right to build a coalition. Jacques, 67, a retired lawyer, said the priority would be to keep the party together for the next two months. ""It's a slap in the face, but people are no longer thinking rationally and want to be sold a dream,"" he said. ""There is a risk the party will explode, but we need to regroup now.""

4/13/2022,"A man who bought and returned a Tesla Model X in early 2020 is still paying for it, CNBC reported. He said he tried to use a policy Tesla had then of seven-day no-questions-asked returns. The case is now in private arbitration. A man who returned a Tesla Model X in 2020 under the carmaker's seven-day no-questions-asked return policy said he's still paying for the $116,000 vehicle more than two years later, CNBC reported Saturday. In an interview with CNBC, Danny Roman, a biking- and hiking-tour operator in Southern California, outlined a lengthy dispute with Tesla over the car's return. He said he decided to return his Model X after finding it had a shorter battery life than he expected and a door that stuck. He also said he discovered that installing a home charger for the car would cost 10 times what a Tesla representative had suggested. He told CNBC that Tesla collected the car in March 2020 and that he was promised by a Tesla representative that his refund would be processed quickly. But messages from Tesla viewed by CNBC showed the company argued it didn't have a seven-day return policy when Roman bought the vehicle. Electrek reported in October 2020 that Tesla had quietly gotten rid of the policy, which was still viewable on the company's website as of September 30, 2020. Roman told CNBC that at one point, he stopped making payments for the car for a month, which damaged his credit rating, so he opted to carry on paying. ""Every time the money gets sucked out of my account, every month, I just cringe,"" he said. Roman told CNBC he was in arbitration with Tesla over the matter. Arbitration is a dispute-resolution process that happens outside of court and is sometimes a condition of a contract of sale. Despite the long tussle over his Model X, Roman told CNBC he's still a ""huge believer in Tesla, Elon Musk, and electric cars,"" adding: ""I hope my story reaches the powers that be at Tesla and they make necessary changes so this does not happen to their future clients.""

4/13/2022,"By Julie Steenhuysen CHICAGO, April 11 (Reuters) - U.S. officials now say that people 50 and older can get a second COVID-19 booster shot to fortify their immune defenses against COVID-19. But for individuals in that group, the decision is complicated. Here are considerations health experts say people should weigh. WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDATION? Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said any person aged 50 and older can get a second COVID-19 booster of an mRNA vaccine from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech at least four months following their last shot. The same goes for people who are severely immunocompromised aged 12 and up as well as those who have received two doses of Johnson & Johnson's shot. Dr. Peter Marks, director of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said the aim is to give older adults the option to top up waning vaccine protection against severe disease as the virus continues to circulate. The highly transmissible Omicron BA.2 subvariant has fueled cases in other countries and is now sweeping the United States, accounting for the majority of all coronavirus infections here. WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE? Data presented to a panel of FDA advisers last week showed that current vaccines lose much of their effectiveness in staving off infections from the Omicron variant but still do a good job at preventing severe disease, especially in people with healthy immune systems. Concerns about the variant's ability to evade the vaccine as well as data showing the shots become less protective over time prompted U.S. health officials to authorize a second booster. Evidence in favor of a second booster comes from an Israeli study of more than 1.2 million adults published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine. It showed that a fourth dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine lowered rates of severe COVID-19 among those age 60 and older but offered only short-lived additional protection against infection. WEIGHING THE RISK The decision to get a fourth dose should take into account a person's individual risk factors, experts say. For people 65 and older, the immune compromised, or those 50 and older with serious medical conditions, the answer is ""pretty easy,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. They should get a second booster. But for healthy people over 50, experts are unsure available data makes a clear case for them to get another booster. ""There's no clear evidence that vaccine protection against severe illness is waning in healthy adults with functioning immune systems,"" said Dr. Michael Daignault, and emergency physician and chief medical advisor to Reliant Health Services, an Atlanta-based testing company. Daignault said the Israeli study may have been flawed by confounding factors such as other preexisting health conditions and behavior. ""I'm not convinced that most people need a fourth dose - or second booster - at this time,"" he said. Dr. Gregory Poland, a former FDA vaccine advisory panel member and head of Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group, said the decision is challenging for many. ""I get many, many calls from my physician colleagues at the clinic and around the United States, wondering what to do,"" he said. For people who have had a third shot, the risk of severe disease is already pretty low, said Dr. Jesse Goodman, an infectious disease expert at Georgetown University and a former FDA chief scientist. Goodman said a fourth dose ""may reduce it further, but we don't know for how long. That's why this is such a difficult call,"" he said. Goodman, who is 70, and Poland, who is 66, both said they are holding off on a fourth dose based on their current health. Because protection from a second booster is likely short-lived, Poland suggested people may want to time their shot for a trip, a high-risk event, or a new surge in cases.
