5/9/2022,"How did you get into comedy?I think I fell into it. It was a night out with the comedy society at my university and we all got up and gave it a go. It went well enough that when I moved to London I thought: “Why not? You seem to have a knack for this.” And here I still am! Who did you look up to when you were first starting out?I remember loving Kitty Flanagan. She is back in Australia now being amazing, but some might remember her from The Sketch Show on ITV. There weren’t a lot of women to aspire to at the time and she was just a natural. Mandy Knight was another who could MC the midnight show at the Comedy Store better than any of the men. What did you spend lockdown doing?I spent lockdown with my family and kids, just taking it easy. I live in London as a self-employed standup comedian; the pace I live and work at is insane. The lockdown was because of health one way or another, so I decided to use the forced sabbatical to be as healthy as I could before the world reopened and we all got back on this merry-go-round on speed we’re all riding. Do you think audiences have changed since lockdown?I don’t think audiences have changed because of lockdown. I think they are evolving because of a general growing awareness and respect of others. The range of people doing comedy is more diverse and the audience’s tastes are reflecting that. They are more comedy savvy than ever, and they have higher expectations. Can you recall a gig so bad, it’s now funny?When I was starting out, I did a song called The Coming Song and I was invited to play a gig on Mothering Sunday for a group of people who, unbeknownst to me, had been invited to bring their mothers to the free gig straight from church. The song did not go well. Those there without their mothers loved it. Those with their mothers didn’t know where to look. What’s an important lesson you’ve learned from being a standup?Not to take life too seriously. They say: comedy = tragedy + time. Of course, this doesn’t apply to everyone. If you’re prime minister, for example, this is not the advice for you. Best heckle?In the middle of my Live at the Apollo, someone yelled out, “I love you!” apropos of nothing. And that was very funny at the time. Best advice you’ve ever been given?They don’t know how shit you are so don’t walk on like you’re shit. Learning to fake it until you make it is invaluable in comedy. A lot of newer male comics are great at this, whereas women tend to wear their newness and honesty on their sleeves. Audiences don’t assume you’re new or rubbish until your insecurities reveal you feel that way. Best advice you ever give?Don’t eat yellow snow. My mother told me that as a joke when I was very young, but as I had never seen snow at that point I thought this was serious advice. Years later I now equate this to: don’t shit where you eat – I think this is prudent, regardless of the weather. You used to perform with a ukulele. Will it ever return?Never say never. I can’t unlearn how to play and sing so why wouldn’t it?

5/9/2022,"EasyJet plans to remove seats in some of its planes this summer as part of a strategy to cut the number of staff it needs. Employers across the economy have complained of difficulty recruiting staff at the salaries they are willing to pay, and airlines are struggling to meet the increased demand as international travel restarts in earnest after Covid-19 lockdowns. Airlines are required by law to provide one member of cabin crew for every 50 seats. By removing the final row of six seats on its smallest plane, the A319, easyJet will cut the number of passengers it can carry from 156 to 150, therefore limiting its requirement to three rather than four cabin crew. Airport and airline bosses are looking to hire thousands of staff to cope with what is expected to be a summer holiday boom, as many international destinations reopen to tourists from countries including the UK. The UK government removed restrictions on international travel in January. Johan Lundgren, the easyJet chief executive, has previously said the company expects to reach near 2019 levels of passenger numbers this summer, despite recent problems with getting security clearance for new recruits. EasyJet was already forced to cancel hundreds of flights over the Easter holiday period, which it blamed on staff sickness during a wave of Covid-19 infections in the UK. Airlines are particularly keen to avoid staffing problems because they can be liable for steep compensation bills for cancellations within two weeks of the departure date. Airlines are generally considered liable for staff shortages. “This summer we will be operating our UK A319 fleet with a maximum of 150 passengers onboard and three crew in line with CAA regulations,” easyJet said in a statement. “This is an effective way of operating our fleet while building additional resilience and flexibility into our operation this summer where we expect to be back to near 2019 levels of flying.”",News/Business,EasyJet to remove row of seats so it can fly with fewer crew,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/09/easyjet-remove-row-of-seats-crew-covid

5/9/2022,"Ispend a considerable amount of my time searching for moments of peace. This is partly the result of the world we live in: we’re locked into a 24/7 society, where being overstimulated is the norm. But it also speaks to personal contradictions: I have a never-ending to-do list that propels me through each day, every action a task to be ticked off, from eating lunch to walking to the shop. For someone who desires tranquillity so much, I don’t leave much room for it. Clearly, I’m not alone in this quest. Much has been made of the relentless cultural march of “mindfulness”, a concept originating as a meditative practice but now seemingly used to refer to anything from paying nearly £70 annually for an app to wild swimming. Too many column inches have already been devoted to dissecting the prevalence of mindfulness, but suffice to say I see its elevation into a mainstream fixture (and its subsequent commodification) as one symptom of a mass search for a little pocket of peace. Last year I worked on a podcast episode for the Wellcome Collection to go with an exhibition it was presenting that was partly devoted to the concept of tranquillity. Chatting with a contributor, the environmental psychologist Dr Eleanor Ratcliffe, I reeled off a list of places in my adopted home, London, where I’d experienced the feeling of transcending my grubby little self and being flooded with utter peace: the tippy-top of St Paul’s cathedral; the Watts Memorial in Postman’s Park; a medieval church tucked away on Ely Place, one of the city’s last privately managed roads. There was a common thread there, Ratcliffe told me, citing the work of her PhD student Ruairi Patterson: awe, that transcendent feeling of reverence and wonder that might be sparked by a particularly fiery sunset, or watching your friend stuff four hotdogs in her mouth at once. ​​I was intrigued by this and reached out to Patterson. Yes, he told me, there is growing evidence that experiencing awe can reduce stress and improve wellbeing. Patterson pointed me to a paper published last year, led by a researcher at Peking University, which found that experiencing “awe-inspiring phenomena” could lead to greater life satisfaction and less stress. Previous work has also suggested that experiencing awe is a key part of nature’s ability to decrease stress levels and improve wellbeing. “These effects,” says Patterson, “result at least in part from the ability of awe-inspiring experiences to ‘put things in perspective’ by making oneself and one’s personal concerns seem small in comparison to the perceived vastness of awe-inspiring phenomena.” A beautiful idea, isn’t it? Yes, I thought, awe certainly plays a central role in when I feel most serene. But giving it some thought, I’m sure it’s not the only factor; there are plenty of times I have felt awe and yet not quite achieved that state of peace. After consideration, I’ve come up with an alternate thesis: it’s about being out of context. The occasions I feel most peaceful is when I have stepped out of the normal flow of my daily life and into someone else’s timeline. Like heading into a church as a non-believer, with no religious tradition in my past. Cycling through a park I never usually visit. Eating lunch in the cafe of a museum instead of reheating my salmon and veg at home. When I am out of context, my problems are unable to find me until I’ve slipped back into the rhythms of my normal existence. The more I’ve thought about this, the more it feels correct. I remember the great sense of peace that would wash over me as a child when I was taken out of school in the middle of the day for a doctor’s appointment. Sitting on the hard, plastic, waiting-room chairs, I would hear the shouts of my peers in the nearby school playground and feel utterly calm that I was not there with them, in my proper place. It’s a comforting mix of quasi-anonymity, novelty, and escape from the flotsam that accrues by simply existing. By its nature, finding tranquillity by stepping out of myself isn’t a lasting way of being. It is a state that can be snatched at; at some point I have to snap back into place. I suspect being constantly at peace would breed complacency. Having to strive for something, even if it’s inner calm, sadly means I value it more. At least armed with the knowledge of exactly what conditions create that sense of serenity means it feels within reach. That alone is soothing. And I did it without the help of a mindfulness app. Saving £70 on self-knowledge: now that’s peace.

5/9/2022,"Eddie Howe has worked wonders at Newcastle since arriving on 8 November – but only in one type of match. Against the big six (also, as things stand, the top six, despite Ralf Rangnick’s best efforts), Howe has managed only one point. The drubbing at the Etihad on Sunday was Newcastle’s 10th defeat in 11 meetings with the big six, the exception being the draw with Manchester United. But against the smaller fry, Howe has made all the difference. He inherited a team with no league wins and half as many points as Watford (five, from 10 games). On his watch Newcastle have racked up 11 victories, as many as Chelsea in the same period. They have one last chance to beat a big-six club when Arsenal visit St James’ Park next Monday. Tim de Lisle Match report: Manchester City 5-0 Newcastle Jürgen Klopp may not wish to copy the Antonio Conte playbook – “I don’t like this kind of football, I cannot coach it,” he said amid the disappointment of failing to win a 13th league game in succession at Anfield – but Tottenham can learn a thing or two from Liverpool according to their head coach. Conte constructed a resolute and impressive Spurs display on Saturday and, despite speculation over his future, believes long-term planning is essential to producing that sort of performance on a consistent basis. “You need a path with a team, a base and to improve the base year by year,” said Conte. “Liverpool did this. They created a foundation with Jürgen and won a lot in seven years. He created a monster, in a good way, and for this you need time, patience and to go step by step.” Andy Hunter Match report: Liverpool 1-1 Tottenham At the beginning of March, Southampton were ninth in the league with a respectable 35 points from 26 games. Now they’re 15th after scraping just five points from the last 10; only clubs that are already relegated have done worse in the past nine weeks. They’re still pretty good against the top teams – three of those five points came against Arsenal – but often feeble in the face of their mid-table neighbours, as they were at Brentford. Ralph Hasenhüttl is quick to take full responsibility, unlike some, but he now finds himself in a curious predicament as a much-admired manager who is in danger, as the Saints’ travelling fans informed him, of being sacked in the morning. Tim de Lisle Match report: Brentford 3-0 Southampton Patrick Vieira will not be making wholesale changes to the Crystal Palace squad this summer as he looks to build on an excellent first season at the helm. Palace are in sight of a first top-10 finish since 2015 having also reached the FA Cup semi-finals since the Frenchman replaced Roy Hodgson last year. The victory over Watford meant for the first time they have achieved four consecutive home clean sheets in the Premier League and Vieira is hoping rising stars such as the defender Tayo Adaramola and the winger Jesurun Rak-Sakyi can force their way into the first-team reckoning next season. “The DNA of this football club is to try to bring young talent through the academy,” he said. “We know who we are and the budget that we have so we have to be smart with our recruitment.” Ed Aarons Match report: Crystal Palace 1-1 Watford On a balmy afternoon in East Anglia, West Ham found the perfect balm for their Europa League wounds by putting four goals past poor old Norwich. This wasn’t just their biggest win of the season, it also marked the end of a mediocre run of 15 points from 14 league games since mid-January. Best of all, it held up a mocking mirror to the 4-0 battering that Manchester United had suffered on the south coast the day before. Suddenly West Ham are only three points behind United with a game in hand and a goal-difference advantage that has just leapt from two goals to 10. If they win both remaining matches, they will finish sixth and be back in the Europa League again. The only slight snag is that the first of those fixtures is against Manchester City. TdL  Match report: Norwich 0-4 West Ham Steven Gerrard gave Emi Buendía the chance to shine behind Aston Villa’s strikers at Burnley and the Argentinian vindicated his manager’s judgment by scoring and creating a goal. Buendía was selected in favour of Philippe Coutinho, with Gerrard mindful of Villa’s workload in May. “Both Phil and Emi will get enough game time to keep them satisfied,” Gerrard said. “Phil understands that he’s played a lot and he’s respectful enough to know that Emi deserves a chance.” Buendía was constantly looking to break the lines and find passes to exploit the movement offered by Danny Ings and Ollie Watkins. Gerrard praised the midfielder for his influence and said he has the capabilities to replace Coutinho. He also admitted he wanted to keep the Brazilian at the club and could use both playmakers together, which would be a dangerous combination, especially considering how potent their strikers look at the moment. Will Unwin Match report: Burnley 1-3 Aston Villa How can it be that Timo Werner does not score hatfuls of goals? His running is relentless and intelligent, he keeps getting in the right positions – and then things keep going wrong. Somehow he has managed just 10 goals in his 56 league appearances for Chelsea, 44 of them in the starting lineup. At times that has been because of poor finishing, and other when his lack of confidence has been obvious, but he also seems a weirdly luckless striker. Saturday was a case in point. Twice he got in good positions and got decent low shots away only to be denied by José Sá; when he did finish neatly, he found himself penalised for clipping the heel of Romain Saïss in the buildup. Somewhere, there is an enormous cache of goals with his name on it. Jonathan Wilson  Match report: Chelsea 2-2 Wolves After Manchester United’s horrendous season plummeted to a new low with their hammering at Brighton, Ralf Rangnick suggested the only positive is the amount of room for improvement. It is indeed cavernous. Erik ten Hag faces an unenviable task in rebuilding this broken club and it is fanciful to expect a quick fix. The problem is that the sheer scale of the job requires major surgery across all areas of the squad. Europa League qualification is not even guaranteed and United have conceded 56 goals – their worst defensive record in a Premier League season. This includes four goals against relegated Watford, and Brighton were similarly rampant throughout their first home victory in 2022. United simply could not cope with the energy and intensity of the hosts, with Leandro Trossard and Pascal Gross heavily involved, who registered their biggest top-flight victory watched by a record crowd at the Amex. Simon Mail  Match report: Brighton 4-0 Manchester United Leeds’ worries looked likely to abate when they took 11 points in five games but they are now in serious difficulty. They will be relegated if they replicate their first-half showing at Arsenal – and, for that matter, much of what they turned out in the second – over the final three games and Jesse Marsch faces a daunting task to lift them before Wednesday’s visit of Chelsea. Elland Road will need to be at its intimidating best, and Leeds will have to improve markedly at both ends. “We’ve got to find a way to defend better with the ball [and] to create chances,” Marsch said. While their four-goal loss against Manchester City was harsh, the scoreline at the Emirates flattered them. Against Chelsea, Brighton and Brentford they have no option but to find the kind of consistency that would save them from the drop – a fate that seemed unthinkable at the start of the campaign. Nick Ames Match report: Arsenal 2-1 Leeds United Suddenly Leicester’s dead rubber at home to Norwich on Wednesday feels a little bit more significant. Leicester were booed off after an insipid defeat at home to Everton extended their winless run to seven matches. After exiting the Europa Conference League at the semi-final stage in Rome last week, their remaining four matches threaten to be a slog. They will not play in Europe next season and failure to beat relegated Norwich will guarantee more questions are asked of Brendan Rodgers and his side, who face a difficult task to earn a top-half finish. “What we have done in three years is gone from a team that is maybe happy to stay in the Premier League to one that is disappointed that we don’t win a trophy,” Rodgers said. “That shows you the mindset change and the shift in mentality. We need to address that in the summer and reintroduce that hunger back into the team.” Ben Fisher Match report: Leicester 1-2 Everton",Sport/Football,Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/09/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action
5/9/2022,"There is one rule behind every movie poster you have ever seen. And it’s not: “Superheroes must stare determinedly into the distance.” It is this: the billing block, the list of cast and crew at the bottom, must be in a typeface that is at least 15% of the size of the film title’s lettering. In 2005, when he was leading the advertising campaign for the Jim Carrey comedy Fun With Dick and Jane, William Loper didn’t like that. The guideline, which is there to ensure billings are actually legible, annoyed Loper because it meant that if he wanted to make a film’s title larger and more eye-catching, he had to make the billing block larger too. But the then executive vice-president of advertising at Sony Pictures spotted a loophole. It was the average height of each letter in the title that counted. So he made just one word in the Carrey comedy’s title huge and bright red: FUN. “We cheated,” he says. But why? Well, between 2003 and 2013, Loper launched eight campaigns a year, each having to be as grabby as possible. And when it came to advertising comedies, there were two big typography tricks: make the title big, and make it red. When the trailer for Catherine Tate’s The Nan Movie dropped in February this year, its title was big and red. Disney’s Cheaper By the Dozen remake, which followed shortly after, has its final word in thick, ruddy, bloated type. What’s more, both posters – like Fun With Dick and Jane – have vast white backgrounds. So, who started the big red titles on empty backgrounds trend and why is it red that tickles our funny bones? No one is better placed to answer this than Loper, who also worked on The Nutty Professor, Are We There Yet?, The Klumps, Liar, Liar, Step Brothers, Hitch and American Pie. By now, I don’t need to tell you how their posters look. “The white background, red typography,” he says, “really thrived in the mid-90s and early 2000s.” As part of his job, Loper showed prototype trailers to test audiences. “We did the teaser trailer for Nutty Professor and it said, ‘Something big is coming’ – and then we slammed on those big titles. That was a huge hit in the focus groups.” Because producers and even stars get a say on a film’s advertising, research like this can help execs prove they are on the right track. But there is no one study that says: “Red equals comedy, big letters equal big money.” Instead, there is the humble bus shelter. Loper explains: “A producer I used to work with would constantly tell me: ‘If I’m driving down the street at 40mph and it’s raining, I want to see a bus shelter poster that has impact. I want to see it from eight blocks away.’” Empty backgrounds help a film’s star pop out, while red is red. There’s a reason why it is the colour of stop signs and classic lipsticks. In the past, when billboards and bus shelter ads were printed on paper, advertisers had to get the campaign right first time. “But now,” says Loper, “you can change a digital billboard every other day. That’s really helped.” Poster designer Rebecca Pitt explains that, 30 years ago, the tech was more limited. “Big red letters were easy to do, whereas 3D metallic lettering only became easy 15 or so years ago.” The latter, she says, has become the default in theatre posters for plays such as Anything Goes and Amélie. Although Pitt has used big red letters herself in a couple of theatre posters: Groan Ups and The Comedy About a Bank Robbery. “These are very accessible shows that appeal to families,” she says. “The big red letters help to signify that. We want to reassure audiences that this’ll be a fun evening out – nothing too highbrow or alternative.” But every campaign wants to be eye-catching and appealing. Why did comedy get a monopoly on big and red – and not, say, action movies or thrillers? Robyn Larkin is the creative director of the film poster agency Bobo, which worked on Winter’s Bone and Netflix’s Paranormal. He describes it as “a sort of chicken and egg situation” whereby marketers became obsessed with “comps” (comparisons) and would ask designers to emulate other successful campaigns. He describes the situation as “a sort of fake myth, where they think that if the promotional look worked well for film A then it will also work for film B”. He cites 1999’s American Pie and 2000’s Meet the Parents as hits that inspired copycat marketing. “Yet American Pie worked because it was a great new sort of film.” Its success probably had little to do with typefaces. Loper believes big type and blank backgrounds started in the late 1980s. So did Honey, I Shrunk the Kids father the whole thing in 1989? Perhaps not: despite its blue-sky background, 1980’s Airplane! was an earlier example. What about the Carry On posters of the 1960s, which liberally employed big red type alongside saucy cartoons? In fact, you can trace the trend all the way back to 1937 and the Marx Brothers’ A Day at the Races, even to Charlie Chaplin’s The Kid from 1921. While comedies at the turn of the millennium undoubtedly caused a resurgence, the trick is almost as old as cinema itself – and it seems unlikely to be going away. “One day,” says Larkin, “there will be a big comedy hit that uses a different style because the team took a risk and it worked. That style may then become the next trope as marketing people across the land copy the style, looking to ride the film’s success.” Perhaps the opposite could happen.

5/9/2022,"Ithought I had already experienced the worst internet abuse – until I posted online about my dog, Hank. I had been wondering if I should take him to the vet, after finding some scary-looking lumps on his chest. When I got Hank, I thought I was vigorously prepared. I had done all the research, bought all the gear, hired a trainer, forked out for pet insurance and found a great vet. I had every intention of being the best dog owner ever. I was ready. What I was not prepared for was the pressure from other dog owners to never make mistakes. On one level, this is a good thing: I want people to have high standards for pet owners. Animals should be treated well. However, if I wanted constantly to be made to feel like I’m not good enough, I would still be living at home. When Hank shat all over a hotel staircase, the stench wasn’t nearly as bad as the looks that people gave me, glaring as if I had kept him in my room for days, feeding him onions and chocolate, just to make him defecate and ruin everyone’s visit to the breakfast buffet. I got the same reaction when his retractable dog lead failed at the same time as he spotted a squirrel and he circled a couple holding hands (twice), tying them together. Onlookers might have been less judgmental if I had just told them that I had trained him to kidnap couples. “Those leads are dangerous!” a woman hissed.

5/9/2022,"There is growing scrutiny over the Alan Tudge’s disappearance on the campaign trail as the education minister shuns the media. With just two weeks to go until election day, Tudge has not addressed the media once, has announced no education policy and has ignored repeated requests for interviews. He has also declined to debate the opposition’s education spokesperson Tanya Plibersek. Instead, the minister has been running a hyperlocal campaign, focused on community appearances and funding for projects in his electorate of Aston, in Melbourne’s east. In December Tudge stepped aside from the education portfolio after allegations were made that he had had an abusive relationship with a former staffer, whom he was having an affair with. Tudge denies the allegations. Stuart Robert is currently acting education minister, but officials confirmed in Senate estimates in April that Tudge will officially remain as the education minister despite claiming he would not return to the frontbench. He also remains in cabinet. The only policies announced by Tudge during this election, however, involve upgrading key roads around Knox, in his electorate. He has promised $300,000 to put lights in both the baseball park in Boronia and Guy Turner Reserve and he also pledged $1.5m for a Hindu community hub at The Basin temple. According to his social media accounts, Tudge has spent the campaign visiting local sporting clubs and businesses but has avoided the scrutiny of media. His own website shows his last interview was on 12 October last year on Sky News. The Liberal party campaign headquarters, Tudge’s electorate office, and his media representative, ignored requests from Guardian Australia for a five-minute phone interview with the MP. No written statement was provided. Throughout the election, Tudge has posted videos of himself visiting places around Knox – all with a focus on local issues. CCTV cameras, the local Headspace and sporting clubs have featured in clips on his social media. The messaging is all local, with no mention of the education portfolio. “We have achieved a lot together locally, including the biggest ever injection of funds for roads, rail, car parking and bridges,” he said announcing his re-election campaign. “We have improved security, upgraded dozens of local sports grounds, record funding into every local school and hospital, and so much more. “Nationally, we have kept the economy strong and the country secure. We have record low unemployment, record funding for schools, hospitals and medicines and massively boosted defence spending.” He holds the electorate with a 10% margin, making it almost impossible for Labor to pick up the seat. But the Labor candidate for Aston, Mary Doyle, said the mood was shifting in the electorate. “As I’ve been talking to residents across Aston, the mood has been quite positive towards Labor and simultaneously increasingly negative towards the Liberals and particularly Alan Tudge,” Doyle said. “Alan Tudge and Scott Morrison are alike – when the going gets tough they disappear.” She accused Tudge of being absent from the community from last year. “His ongoing absence since last year has been made even more apparent by Labor’s active team on the ground, talking to locals about what matters to them,” Doyle said. “Labor has a plan to address their concerns by strengthening Medicare, making childcare cheaper, creating secure local jobs, and investing in local manufacturing.” The New Liberals’ candidate Ryan Bruce, who is running on a platform of net zero by 2030 and a federal Icac, said he had not seen the sitting MP on the campaign trail. “The notable thing is the absence of Tudge. I haven’t seen him, I haven’t found a single person who said they’ve seen him,” Bruce said. Bruce concedes Tudge will probably hold on to the electorate, but questions whether the constituents deserve better. “He is taking it for granted. I don’t think he’s been a great member for the seat.” Avoiding tough questions does not mean his campaign has been smooth-sailing. Two weeks ago several of the MP’s signs were vandalised with the words “scum”, “Icac” and “Women” with an X covering his face. Tudge responded with a statement posted to his Facebook, saying the damage was “the work of [his] opponents”. “This is the work of my opponents and says more about them and what they represent than anything else,” he wrote. “They should be on notice though: three have already been caught by police and will soon have criminal records. Thanks to those residents who recorded them. “I won’t be deterred by these cowards. In fact, they only encourage me and my team to work harder.”",News/Australia news,‘I haven’t seen him’: Alan Tudge skips schools portfolio for local grants announcements ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/09/i-havent-seen-him-alan-tudge-skips-schools-portfolio-for-local-grants-announcements
5/9/2022,"The national disability insurance scheme minister, Linda Reynolds, has played down the surge in people filing legal appeals against cuts to funding packages, saying that the amount is still a “minuscule” proportion of overall participants. The latest statistics, released on Friday, show the number of people appealing NDIS decisions to the administrative appeals tribunal increased by 244% in the March quarter, compared with the same period in 2021. In a rare interview during the election campaign, Reynolds was asked what she would do to address the growing number of people “going to the courts so they can get the support they need”. The host of the “Reasonable and Necessary” podcast, the disability rights advocate Dr George Taleporos, said he had been “shocked” by the increase and noted the process could be “very traumatic” and “quite expensive”. “It’s obviously very topical at the moment,” Reynolds said. “I think the context of this is really important … Remembering we’ve got half a million people now on the scheme, the overall percentage of people who are going through to the AAT appeals process is still minuscule. “And most of those people who do go to the AAT, well over 90% of those are settled as part of the early AAT process. It’s important that people have an avenue to appeal to the AAT … Again it’s a tiny fraction, still. “Because we’ve gone up to half a million [participants] now, proportionally you’d expect the numbers going to the AAT would correspondingly increase.” The latest NDIA quarterly report said on Friday there were 4,265 open AAT cases at March 2022, compared with 518,668 participants in the scheme. However, while the number of AAT appeals made up 0.42% of all participants in March 2021, that has risen to 1.24% in the latest March quarter. Specifically, the report showed there were 1,583 cases in the March quarter, a 244% increase on the 460 cases in the 2021 March quarter. In the December 2021 quarter, the rise was even larger, with the 1,871 appeals representing a 366% on the 401 cases filed in 2020. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The disability community have argued the AAT process can be traumatic for people with disability and on Sunday, Guardian Australia revealed a case in which a New South Wales man in his 20s spent his last months fighting in the AAT for denied supports. Reynolds said the government had recently provided an extra $100m to disability advocacy services to better assist people going to the AAT. Some advocacy organisations have said they were unable to take on more clients due to the unprecedented demand. Taleporos said they were “overwhelmed”. Reynolds also denied Labor claims of cuts to the NDIS, and noted the government had pledged an extra $157bn in the most recent budget to “fully fund” the scheme. Labor claims an increasing number of people are facing arbitrary cuts to plans, pointing to anecdotal cases and the experience of advocacy services. Among its policies it claims will “fix” the scheme is a crack down on spending on external legal lawyers and the introduction of an as yet unspecified new “review” process to keep cases out of the AAT.",News/Society,NDIS minister downplays major increase in appeals since 2021 as ‘tiny fraction’ of participants,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/09/ndis-minister-downplays-244-increase-in-appeals-since-2021-as-tiny-fraction-of-participants
5/9/2022,"With every goal scored, trophy lifted and piece of history recorded, Sam Kerr continues to raise herself into a pantheon reserved for a select few in Australian sport. After the Matildas captain helped lift Chelsea to a third consecutive Women’s Super League title on Sunday with a stunning brace, her status as one her country’s most celebrated athletes has been rubber-stamped. Kerr dragged her side back onto level terms against Manchester United with a fiercely struck volley moments into the second half, before she repeated the feat 20 minutes later with a floated effort, having controlled the ball on her chest and swivelled to face goal in one effortless movement. Effectively killing the game off at 4-2, the second was a miraculous goal. By all rights, the combination of the occasion, the high stakes and the degree of difficulty should have consigned it to the realm of fiction. Yet for Kerr, who spoke afterwards about how she visualises moments such as these, this is her reality. Sam Kerr and two of the best goals you will see ANYWHERE 💫🔵And to win the title, no less.Chelsea legend. Aussie legend. Golden boot winner Samantha Kerr.#FAWSL #OptusSport pic.twitter.com/mN1QiydFwd Lured to by the promise of trophies, she has now lifted three WSL titles, two League Cups, a Community Shield and an FA Cup with Chelsea. In just over two years in west London, she has won back-to-back WSL golden boots and last week was named alongside Liverpool’s Mo Salah as one of the Football Writers Association’s footballers of the year. In January, Fifa recognised her as the second-best women’s player in the world behind only Spain’s Alexia Putellas. At just 28 years old, she has won domestic titles or golden boots – or both – in England, the United States and Australia. Internationally, she captains and has played over 100 games for the Matildas. In January, she surpassed Tim Cahill as Australian football’s most prolific international goalscorer at the Asian Cup, even if the campaign ultimately ended in failure. Slowly but surely, Kerr has become the alpha and omega for her nation. It took just over seven years for her to reach double figures after scoring her first international goal at 16, but in the four and a half years since, she has scored nearly 50. Upon being named as the coach who will lead the Matildas into a home World Cup in 2023, one of Tony Gustavsson’s first moves was to spend hours watching and analysing his new talisman’s goals in an attempt to learn how she ticked. Inevitably, such an approach carries its own risks. The Chelsea squad with whom Kerr dominates, as well as her role within that, differs from the national side. It’s not simply a matter of plug in and play. Much like the Socceroos’ experience with Cahill, the Matildas have faced questions over a perceived over-reliance on Kerr to score and the potentially limiting factors in the approach and composition that flows from this. They’re important conversations to have and scrutiny is needed – but they’re only made possible because of her ability. Without question, Kerr is one of her nation’s biggest sporting stars. Given the context of her achievements, arguments can be made that she may in fact be the biggest and, even if not, an even stronger one can be made that in the wake of Ash Barty’s surprise retirement she is her homeland’s most notable active female athlete. Every accomplishment and piece of recognition she receives only adds to this. Sign up for our new and free women’s football newsletter! So-called “code wars” are one of the most tiresome aspects of Australian sport, but observing that Kerr is the type of athlete other sports could only dream of having isn’t so much a salvo in this ideological conflict so much as an observation of objective fact. It’s not just because she’s the face of a national team or is one of the best in the world at what she does – Australian sport is blessed to have a number of athletes that fit that category – it’s that she does all this while signed to one of global sport’s biggest brands in Chelsea, as one of the faces of another in Nike, and while playing the most-watched sport on the planet. In a vacuum, Kerr is just one of 11 players on the park at any one time, but from a wider perspective, her profile has transcended football in the eyes of an Australian public increasingly apathetic towards the world game. Even if you don’t know football, you know of Kerr. A-League Women sides with newly opened borders find themselves at a loss as to which marquee players they could target to move the dial. Who could cut it in a world where suburban parks around the country only a few years ago had Kerr scoring a hat-trick almost every week? The answer is likely nobody. Because Australia has never had an athlete like Sam Kerr.",Sport/Sport,Sam Kerr’s latest exploits mark her out as one of Australia’s greatest athletes | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/09/sam-kerrs-latest-exploits-mark-her-out-as-one-of-australias-greatest-athletes
