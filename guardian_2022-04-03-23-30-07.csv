4/3/2022,"One in five women who ask for a pay rise are successful in receiving one compared with just under a third of men, polling has found. A YouGov survey of more than 16,000 adults found that of the 40% of people who asked for a pay rise, just over a quarter were successful. But disparities are revealed when breaking down the data along gender lines. Forty-three per cent of men asked for a pay rise, compared with a third (33%) of women. Furthermore, 31% of men were successful, while just over a fifth (21%) of women received a salary increase. The research found the chasm exists most prominently for those in their 30s and older. For 18- to 29-year-olds in work, 18% of men and 16% of women have asked for a pay rise and received at least one. However, for adults in their 30s, just under a third (31%) of men who asked for a pay rise were successful, compared with 19% of women. These disparities further existed along class lines, with the analysis finding that adults in more middle-class occupations are more likely to have asked for a pay rise and been successful than their counterparts in more working-class occupations. The YouGov analysis comes after gender pay gap reporting was made mandatory by the government in 2017 for all companies with more than 250 employees. In December, Guardian analysis showed that the gender pay gap reported to the government by the UK’s largest firms is widening, with women being paid a median hourly rate of 10.2% less than their male colleagues. Jemima Olchawski, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said the UK haf a “pernicious gender pay gap that needs to be tackled”. She continued: “Detailed academic research disputes the idea that women are less likely to ask for a pay rise and instead finds that they ask at a similar rate, but typically get slightly less. That said, it’s simply not right that women continue to be undervalued for the work they do – be that in paid work or caring responsibilities. “This research suggests that a gender gap in asking opens in our 30s. That’s when most mothers have their first children – and with so many flexible working requests refused, we know too many mums feel precarious enough in getting work they can do, let along getting a raise. What you come into a job with matters too – it’s not just about pay rises and bonuses.” Anthony Painter, the director of policy at the Chartered Management Institute, said the “confidence gap” was real and had “detrimental impacts for pay and progression for women”. “You have to question whether the knock-back figures we see in this research are part of the reason,” he added. A spokesperson from the government’s equalities hub said: “This government is committed to addressing pay inequality. Through our new pay transparency pilot we will support organisations to provide salary details as standard on job advertisements.”",News/World news,"Women who ask for pay rise less successful than men, UK poll reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/women-who-ask-for-pay-rise-less-successful-than-men-uk-poll-reveals
4/3/2022,"Lately, I’ve expended a lot of mental energy considering Twitter. If this sounds like a sad state of affairs, don’t worry – I’m aware. But it’s preferable to my previous approach, which was a greedy embrace of everything the platform had to offer with no thought as to what exactly it was reaping from me in return, beyond data. While the little bird app has certainly enriched my life in numerous ways, frankly, its impact terrifies me now. There is a certain recognition that online networking spaces such as Facebook, YouTube and Reddit can actively facilitate the development of extreme, obsessive views. Yet Twitter does not seem subject to the same analysis. In the mainstream, it appears to be viewed as a space where people with existing oppositional, fixed positions coalesce and shout at each other, rather than a furnace where those unyielding stances are forged in the first place. This is an oversight. In fact, Twitter offers the perfect conditions for developing and calcifying polarised positions. It silos people off into echo chambers in which their interaction with like-minded individuals can vastly change their perception of reality. (For instance, at the 2019 election I truly thought Labour had a chance.) Twitter users are also in constant combat mode, hackles raised in anticipation of the most dreaded event: public disagreement. Dissent on Twitter is rarely ever expressed politely: it is gladiatorial. Twitter communities often show up to back their chosen fighter, furthering the sense of “us” v “them”. Extensive research shows that disagreement – even the well-evidenced, politely delivered kind – does very little to change someone’s opinion. Often, it simply pushes that person to drive their flag further into the ground. Rather than change minds, exposure to opposing views can actually further shunt people to the other end of the spectrum. One 2018 experiment paid Republicans and Democrats to follow Twitter bots collating messages from the opposing side; they discovered both groups became more polarised, not less. When I am on Twitter, I find myself hating everything and everyone – especially myself – wasting their lives arguing about nothing. I lose my ability to empathise, to see humanity beyond the avatars. Never am I more disconnected than when I am plugged in. Even those ostensibly on the same side find themselves locked into death spirals of disagreement. As the academic Julia Bell writes in her clarifying 2020 essay, Radical Attention: “Consensus politics, or even any kind of politics, becomes impossible, because we are too outraged to actually think. So busy interacting, raging and denouncing that we are tricked into thinking we are actually changing something, rather than just responding to these manufactured demands on our attention.” Existing in a state of constant fury on Twitter doesn’t equate to full-blown extremism. But the obsessive, feverish, zero-sum nature of Twitter discourse certainly contributes to an environment that breeds, at best, suspicion and hostility to opposing worldviews and, at worst, festering radicalisation. Transphobia is an obvious example; Twitter has seen the spread of anti-trans views beyond the confines of niche forums to become a moral panic. The thing is, the extreme division that characterises Twitter is not widespread in society at large. Research by King’s College London’s (KCL) Policy Institute in 2019 found that while people had become more polarised based on their political identities, for example Brexiters and remainers, differences in opinion on specific policies, such as immigration, were in fact starting to converge. As of 2021, only 28% of the UK population uses Twitter. But it has outsize influence. What matters is who is on there: which people are experiencing the white-hot anger of engaging daily with the timeline. “Political elites are on Twitter every day, and for all the warnings that Twitter isn’t real life, it feels like real life to them,” said Ezra Klein, the author of Why We’re Polarised, in a 2020 interview with the Verge. “They’re stuck in a hyper-polarised informational system and it influences the candidates they support, the messages they emphasise, the stories they focus on.” Klein was speaking about US politics but his analysis applies to Britain too. It’s not just British politicians: it’s our media class – celebrities as well. If you have a public profile, the likelihood is that you’re on Twitter and active. It influences which topics are afforded importance: this week we saw Kay Burley ask Angela Rayner about whether women could have a penis, a question the Labour deputy leader quite rightly said was prominent on social media. These discussions then spill over into policy, as we saw this week when the government excluded trans people from a ban on conversion practices. More widely, these dialogues and the people who take part in them shape public discourse. Think of the amount of news coverage and political speeches devoted to the likes of “cancel culture” or “wokeness” – terms the majority of the British public say they’ve never heard of, according to research done last year by KCL. Are trending topics on Twitter really synonymous with the most pressing issues facing a populace experiencing the biggest fall in living standards since the 1950s? As Klein put it: “If [elites] become more polarised, and act in more polarised ways, that will ultimately polarise the public simply by presenting them with very polarising choices to respond to.” The antagonism and extremes of Twitter may not be “real life”. But as long as enough of the people who decide what “real life” looks like are spending time scrolling, it doesn’t really matter.

4/3/2022,"Scholastique Mukasonga’s tender paean to motherhood and community (originally published in French in 2008 and seamlessly translated by Jordan Stump) explores how exile robs people of their traditions and identity. Born in Rwanda in 1956, Mukasonga experienced early on the ethnic conflict that has scarred her country. In 1960, her Tutsi family was exiled to the “dry, dusty plain of the Bugesera”, close to the Burundi border. They left behind their beloved mountains and the cows they had once proudly herded, forced to scrape together a living from growing sorghum, beans and vegetables. Mukasonga pays homage to her mother, Stefania, and the women in the refugee villages who “fed, protected, counselled and consoled” them all. The author recalls the rituals that shaped her formative years and nurtured her family. The arranging of marriages, the imbibing of sorghum beer, the reward of bread and the women’s love of pipe-smoking are related with a deft touch. And the threat of sudden violence from Hutu soldiers is ever-present. A reverence for learning is at the heart of her memoir. “Progress” was celebrated and her parents recognised that education was key to giving their children the opportunity to join “the evolved”. Sadly, Mukasonga had to leave her school in Butare and flee to Burundi. She settled in France in 1992, two years before the Tutsi genocide; 37 members of her family were massacred. This bloodshed haunts and propels the narrative. At the start, Mukasonga writes: “Mama, I wasn’t there to cover your body and all I have left is words… over and over, my sentences weave a shroud for your missing body.” In her heartbreaking conclusion, she describes a nightmare about those she left behind. The shadow of her friend Candida asks her: “Do you have a pagne [cloth wrap] big enough to cover them all, every one of them… every one… every one?” The Barefoot Woman is an extraordinary tribute to “Mother Courage”, as well as a timely reminder of war’s devastation.

4/3/2022,"Despite being only 24, singer-songwriter Omar Apollo is possessed of a remarkably mature voice. It effortlessly meandered through a nonchalant tenor and crooning falsetto on 2017’s breakout single Ugotme and has since traversed everything from guitar-laced funk to Latin folk and club-ready R&B. This genre-hopping, over the course of two EPs and 2020’s mixtape Apolonio, has drawn comparisons to the likes of contemporary neo-soul artists Daniel Caesar and Miguel, without committing to a particular style. On his debut album Apollo finds his strength in the whispering intimacy of downtempo ballads. Highlights come in its softest moments, from the plaintive guitar strumming and stacked harmonies of Mr Neighbour to Invincible (featuring Caesar) – dovetailing the pair’s remarkably similar voices over snappy, compressed drum production. Uptempo numbers such as the Pharrell-produced Tamagotchi and the chugging Talk, meanwhile, feel shoehorned in for radio play, removing breathing space for Apollo’s vibrato-laden voice and overstuffing the record to 16 tracks. Apollo’s aptitude for unexpected genres can provide beautiful results, as on the yearning En El Olvido, but it can equally speak of a jarring restlessness. Once he embraces the certainty of that softness, he will come into his own.",Arts/Music,Omar Apollo: Ivory review – a mixed bag of restless pop,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/03/omar-apollo-ivory-review-a-mixed-bag-of-restless-pop
4/3/2022,"A UN-brokered two-month ceasefire in Yemen was broadly holding on its first full day with oil shipments reaching the port of Hodeida, including some ships that have been barred from entering for 88 days. The ceasefire is the biggest step forward in the six-year war and is intended to apply inside and outside the country’s borders. In a statement, the UN special envoy Hans Grundberg stressed the importance of building on the agreement to restore trust between the warring parties and resume a political process aimed at ending the conflict. He hopes such a relatively long ceasefire provides an opportunity to develop full peace talks, and to start to address some of the underlying economic problems prolonging the conflict. “The aim of this truce is to give Yemenis a necessary break from violence, relief from the humanitarian suffering, and most importantly hope that an end to this conflict is possible,” Grundberg said. The terms of the truce include facilitating the entry of 18 fuel ships into the ports of Hodeida and allowing two commercial flights a week to and from Sana’a airport to predetermined destinations. The terms also include convening a meeting between the parties to agree on opening roads in the city of Taiz and elsewhere to improve civilians’ freedom of movement inside Yemen. “My heartfelt congratulations to all Yemenis on the start of the holy month of Ramadan,” Grundberg said. “I hope the onset of this truce will give Yemenis a chance to celebrate the holy month in peace, safety and tranquility.” The ceasefire coincided with the separate Gulf Cooperation Council-sponsored talks between many of the warring parties in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Those talks are not being attended by the Houthi rebel group that claimed responsibility for further attacks last week on Saudi Aramco sites inside Saudi Arabia. The British ambassador to Yemen, Richard Oppenheim, urged the Houthis to join the talks in Riyadh, adding that the aim was to turn the ceasefire into something permanent. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Saturday expressed hope for a “political process” to bring peace to the impoverished country. “You must take that momentum in order to make sure that this truce is fully respected and that it is renewed and … that a true political process is launched,” he said. “This demonstrates that even when things look impossible, when there is the will to compromise, peace becomes possible,” Guterres added. The US special envoy for Yemen, Tim Lenderking, claimed the ceasefire was the product of a change in battlefield dynamics and a realisation by the Iran-backed Houthis that they cannot win militarily. “We would like to see Iran move away from the negative tactics and role they have played up this point,” he said.",News/World news,Yemen: two-month ceasefire begins with hopes for peace talks ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/yemen-two-month-ceasefire-begins-un-hopes-for-peace-talks
4/3/2022,"In a rare and surprising example of restraint, this week’s episode of Saturday Night Live avoids diving straight into The Thing, save for a brief mention late in its cold open. Instead, the show opens with a new episode of Fox & Friends that sees morning talk show hosts and rightwing stooges Steve Doocy (Alex Moffat), Ainsley Earhardt (Heidi Gardner) and Brian Kilmeade (Mikey Day) lob softball questions at Supreme court justice Clarence Thomas (Kenan Thompson) and wife Ginni (Kate McKinnon). Justice Thomas is cagey about his recent hospitalization, while Ginny – aka, “the Yoko Ono of the supreme court” – unconvincingly denies her role in the Capitol riots, even as she can’t help but call upon “a tidal wave of Biblical vengeance to wash away the Biden crime family all the way to Gitmo.” After a brief tirade about Disney “turning your kindergartener gay” from the network’s resident wino, Judge Jeanine Pirro (Cecily Strong), the hosts are visited by former President Trump (James Austin Johnson), calling in from bed at Mar-a-Lago. He rambles about Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars (“I did see slap, I enjoyed slap, I was very impressed with my Hitch,”), before outright copping to his part in the insurrection (“In many ways it was an intentional planned coup, yes”) and its cover up (“I was too busy with phone call, and burner phone and coup.”) This cold open suffers from the same lack of narrative and thematic cohesion that most Fox News segments do, but Johnson’s movie-obsessed, definite article-allergic Trump continues to prove a winner and crowd pleaser. The night’s host is standup comic Jerrod Carmichael. Straight away, Carmichael says he’s “not gonna talk about it …,” before going on to do exactly that, even if he never says what “it” is. Instead, he talks about how it feels like we’ve all been “talking about it for so long,” asking, “Doesn’t it feel like it happened somewhere between Jamiroquai and 9/11?” Despite his reticence, he says Lorne Michael told him he had to discuss it, because “The nation needs to heal”. He’s flabbergasted that Lorne would put that onus on him, given that “has to be the least famous host in SNL history”. Still, he uses the opportunity to introduce himself and promote his new HBO special Rothaniel (in which he comes out as gay), although when it comes to the burden of national responsibility, he passes the buck to former President Obama. The first sketch of night is a game show called Is My Brain Okay?, which tasks contestants with identifying simple things they “definitely knew before Covid”, such as normal items like wheelbarrows (guesses include “bicycle”, “farm bicycles”, and “wheelmonkey”), days of the week, the names of close friends, and ways to start everyday conversations. It’s a clever idea that attempts to coast on its cleverness, but the funniest bits are just Sara Sherman acting like a weirdo. Short Ass Movie is a new musical number from Pete Davidson, musical guest Gunna, Chris Redd and Red Rocket star Simon Rex. In it, they rap about how their short attention spans render them incapable of watching any movie longer than 90 minutes. It’s a ploddingly obvious bit of guy humor that doesn’t even track with the examples they give: we’re expected to believe modern day bros can’t hang with Heat but will happily toss on Eraserhead? Please. Rex salvages it some with funny bars about his love of the Ernest movies and a good dig at Davidson’s interminable comedy vehicle The King of Staten Island, although his appearance is so random as to be baffling, especially when you consider that his recent breakout came about in a movie that runs at 128 minutes. On Shop TV, sassy southern hosts (Strong, Day) welcome a dollmaker (Carmichael) to show off his latest toy: Riley Rainbow. Things are going smoothly up until he changes the doll’s dress, revealing a giant, rainbow-colored bush sprouting out of her crotch. He explains it’s not what it looks like – a “vagafro”, as one angry caller refers to it – but simply “the end of the head-spool inside … it’s an anchor point, any dollmaker will know that”. His explanations are unconvincing, but the doll proves a hot item with the home – or in the case of one caller, prison – audience nonetheless. Following this, the show finally gets around to addressing the elephant in the room. Carmichael play a seat filler at the Oscars who happens to land a seat directly behind his hero Will Smith (Redd) right as Chris Rock is taking the stage. Smith’s intense friendliness before, during and after his violent outbursts gradually reveal the depths of his insanity. It’s not a particularly brilliant take on the story, although Redd’s full-throated delivery of “Get my wife’s name out your fucking mouth!” earns some big laughs, as does his near breakdown when talking about his infamous interview on wife Jada Pinkett-Smith’s Red Table show from 2021. Gunna takes the stage for a performance of Banking on Me, before Weekend Update gives almost the entirety of the first news rundown over to the Oscars debacle. Michael Che says he understands where Smith is coming from, noting “You can’t expect him to sit there and watch another man jump all over his wife … without signing an NDA.” He’s also tired of pretending that everyone knew about Jada being diagnosed with alopecia: “As much as we heard about Jada and Will’s personal lives, you can’t expect us to retain everything. It’s like Kanye saying, ‘Don’t act like y’all didn’t know about my psoriasis!’” Meanwhile, Colin Jost is befuddled that the Oscars let Smith stay just because Chris Rock said it was OK: “So now we just ask the victim right after they get hit in the head, ‘Hey, you cool if the guy who just attacked you hang around for a while? You don’t want to make him mad again.’ I can’t believe the Academy has a worse concussion protocol than the NFL.” They eventually move on, with Jost inviting on Republican senator Marsha Blackburn. She defends asking supreme court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson (Strong) “What is woman?” and doubles down on her sensationalist questions by wheeling out on of those “big, stupid, dumbass boards and big, stupid, dumbass pictures” that her ilk love to use. Strong’s Blackburn impersonation is utterly indistinguishable from her Marjorie Taylor Greene, although that probably says less about her than it does the Republican party. Che returns one last time to the Oscars controversy by bringing on OJ Simpson (Thompson) to give his take. He tries to see both sides of the issue, genially noting “they both seem like good guys”, although he’s quick to fly off the handle at several points, such as when Che mentions the academy considering taking away Smith’s trophy. Outbursts aside, there’s nothing here that matches the real OJ’s video on the subject for sheer weirdness or shamelessness. Next, a family and two mortuary assistants gather at a seaside cliff to see to the remains of their departed grandfather. The family expects a standard scattering of ashes, only to watch in horror as the morticians toss their loved one’s full cadaver over the edge. A hilariously simple sight gag, it’s a pity that the sketch couldn’t have ended on it, because the remainder drags on awkwardly. That same awkwardness runs throughout the following sketch, which sees Kyle Mooney play an awkward tourist who gets way too invested in a friend-of-a-friend’s boring story about a New York lunch. Gunna returns to the stage and, along with Future, performs Pushing P, before the show closes out with a pre-filmed sketch about gay-friendly baby T-shirts with slogans such as “Future Twink”, “Little Les”, “No Kink at Pride” and “I Heart Kristen Stewart”. It’s no less insufferable than the performative types it’s poking fun at, but at least it’s over quickly. After skirting around the big story of the day for the first half of the episode, SNL certainly gave it plenty of attention during the show’s back-half. They did a decent job of things too, at least when you consider how bad it could have been. The show was very clear in taking Rock’s “side”, going about as hard at Smith as they seem willing to go at anyone outside of rightwing politicos. No doubt many will take umbrage with this, but you had to expect SNL would stand up for one of their own. That said, there was an air of grim inevitability every time the subject came up, even outside Carmichael’s monologue, with the way in which our social media-driven culture utterly exhausts any given story within days or even hours of it occurring bringing into question the very necessity of Saturday Night Live’s continued existence.",Arts/Television & radio,Saturday Night Live: Jerrod Carmichael hosts an inevitably slap-heavy episode,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/03/saturday-night-live-jerrod-carmichael-hosts
4/3/2022,"European leaders have condemned the killings of unarmed civilians in Bucha and the surrounding areas of Kyiv, while vowing to impose further sanctions against Russia. The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, said he was shocked by “haunting images of atrocities committed by [the] Russian army in liberated region of Kyiv”, adding that “further EU sanctions and support are on their way”. Germany’s vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, condemned the killings of civilians in the town of Bucha as a “terrible war crime [that] cannot go unanswered” and called for a strengthening of sanctions. The country’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said the images from Bucha were “unbearable”. “Putin’s frantic violence is wiping out innocent families and knows no bounds,” she wrote on Twitter, adding that those responsible for war crimes must be held to account. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said she was “appalled by reports of unspeakable horrors in areas from which Russia is withdrawing”. An independent investigation was urgently needed, she said, and “perpetrators of war crimes will be held accountable”. Michel said the EU was helping Ukraine and non-governmental organisations gather evidence for international courts. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, who spoke to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Saturday, said the UK “will continue to step up military, economic and diplomatic support, including further ramping up sanctions to increase the economic pressure on Putin’s war machine, while Russian troops remain on Ukrainian territory”. As Russian forces retreated from the towns and suburbs of Kyiv, reporters found horrifying evidence of atrocities against civilians, including families with children killed trying to escape. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, urged the international criminal court and international organisations to come to the region to collect evidence of Russian war crimes. Speaking on Times Radio on Sunday, he said Bucha was a “deliberate massacre”. Describing Russia as “worse than Isis”, he said Russian forces were guilty of murder, torture, rape and looting. He also urged G7 countries to impose “devastating” sanctions immediately. At a Brussels summit last week, the EU’s 27 leaders agreed to “move quickly with further coordinated robust sanctions” against Russia and its ally Belarus, but they have been divided about next steps. Germany, whose industrial economy is heavily dependent on Russian gas, has resisted calls for an immediate ban on Russian fossil fuels, angering Poland and the Baltic states, who would like the most stringent measures against the Kremlin’s war machine. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who is facing a stiff challenge from a united opposition in parliamentary elections on Sunday, has also faced criticism from Ukraine for his past support for Russia. Over the weekend, Zelenskiy renewed his attack on Orbán, saying he had failed to show moral leadership and lacked honesty. “He is virtually the only one in Europe to openly support Mr Putin,” Zelenskiy said. On Saturday, Latvian authorities announced that all three Baltic states had stopped importing Russian gas since 1 April. Lithuania’s president, Gitanes Nausėda, said his country was no longer importing Russian gas. ”If we can do it, the rest of Europe can too,” he wrote on Twitter. Nausėda said the “photo and video evidence from Irpin [and] Bucha unveil the brutal reality of horrific war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine”. Russia’s actions in Bucha were consistent with more than a century of military practice, said Jack Watling, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. “Anyone saying that Bucha is the result of brutalisation or rogue behaviour is wrong. This was the plan. It was premeditated,” he wrote on Twitter. “And if the Russian military had been more successful there would have been many more towns like it.” “Now that the Ukrainians have pushed the Russians out of Kyiv, the Russians are in this kind of dangerous inflection point, where the Russians have a more credible concept of operation,” he told the Guardian, referring to Russia’s decision to focus on southern Ukraine and the Donbas. “The Russians could regroup and rebuild momentum and start taking ground again, but they are currently on the back foot and they are somewhat disorganised and morale is very low. If Ukrainians can capitalise on that they can potentially roll back the Russians.” He added that the next couple of weeks “are a critical turning point in terms of whether the Ukrainians can keep the momentum”. Western countries needed to prioritise military equipment, such as anti-tank weapons, air defence missiles and a portable air defence system that would allow Ukraine “to start attriting the Russian air defence systems command posts, electronic warfare assistance, high-value targets”. “Not all western countries have those systems and those that don’t should help resource those that do.” The evidence of atrocities emerged against a backdrop of faltering peace talks. Russia’s chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said talks on an agreement were not advanced enough to allow a meeting between Zelenskiy and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, contradicting a more optimistic statement from his Ukrainian opposite number, David Arakhamia. Ukraine has offered to relinquish its goal to join Nato, a key Russian demand, but the two sides have not agreed on the status of Russia-annexed Crimea and two self-declared republics in the Donbas.

4/3/2022,"As the Olympic hurdler Rai Benjamin discovered in Tokyo last year, when he finished second to Karsten Warholm in one of the greatest races of all time, you can smash a longstanding world record and still end up losing. Nat Sciver can now relate. Her one-woman assault on one of Australia women’s best ever bowling attacks was the heartbreaking equivalent of breasting the tape just after it’s been broken by the person in front of you. In the mathematical and therefore most important sense, England got nowhere near the opposition’s total in this World Cup final. And yet it felt so much closer because of Sciver’s 148 off 121 balls. It was a resplendent innings of power and panache, touched by genius. Unfortunately for her team, it was also the second most spectacular innings to happen at the ground that day. It may never have been triggered at all had it not been for the enormity of Alyssa Healy’s achievement in setting the highest ever individual score in a World Cup final. The fact that Sciver was herself left within neck-breathing distance of Adam Gilchrist’s 149 – that cricket was only a scampered single away from two women topping that all-time chart – will remain an exquisite, lingering torture until the next time the numbers change. Until then, we have the memories – and should cherish them, because the England vice-captain’s performance deserves to be far more than a footnote. With the score 38 for two, England’s leading tournament runscorer stayed quiet for all of two overs before she charged Alana King to hit the first, and only, six of the game over midwicket. There were two early lbw calls – one of them overturned on review – and the loss of her captain; and at 86 for three, the sun was going down on both the horizon and on England’s chances. None of this, however, punctured Sciver’s pace or confidence, be it in the bottom‑handed legside loft, the cavalier scoop over the shoulder, or the perpetual hustle between the wickets. Her first 50 came off 53 balls, and she kept England in touch with the required runrate, at sixes and sevens, despite the wickets that continued to fall at the other end. Like Healy, she was a continual bother to the bowlers, repeatedly sending the ball in unexpected directions. Where the Australian opener had moved around the crease like a fencing master – the resultant shots seeming to defy the rules of both physics and geometry – Sciver stood and swiped with obdurate power. As a bowler, she had felt Healy’s sting herself. After England chose to bowl, Sciver’s eight overs went for 65 (only Charlie Dean had a worse economy rate) – and she dropped Healy on 41, in the same over that Danni Wyatt dropped Rachael Haynes. As Australia’s first- and then second-wicket stands rolled on, the entire game seemed reduced to a single point of interest: just how gigantic would their total be? Under the weight of Healy’s brilliance, only equal and opposite force could prevent this final collapsing into a farce. And here it was, the solo effort that seemingly defied reality yet perfectly encapsulates the ever-growing skillset of England’s new star player in this tournament. Sciver even reached her century in 10 fewer balls than Healy. The irrepressible all-rounder may not have been able, ultimately, to rescue England – but she did at least rescue the game. She had done it before in this tournament, against the same opposition. In England’s opening group match, a Sciver century had kept them in the hunt against a then-record total, and after this game she admitted that the disappointment of that defeat had stuck with her and inspired her here. But in Hamilton Sciver had support from two top-order batters. In the final she had Sophia Dunkley and Charlie Dean. And yet, even with eight wickets down and 100 runs needed, you still felt that she might just get them all herself, not least when she brought up her 50 partnership with Dean with the third and most bludgeoning of her reverse sweeps, a shot she only recently added to her arsenal. It was from Anya Shrubsole that Sciver took over the vice‑captain’s duties this year, and it was particularly poignant that it should be these two that ended the game together at the crease. Shrubsole, the psychology student and ultimate pressure sponge, had been the one bowler to hold to a line and length that troubled Australia’s batters, the only one who kept them to under four an over. And Shrubsole has been England’s last, best hope before – first as the six-fer hero of the 2017 final, and again, in this tournament, as the number 11 that saw them through that hairy near‑exit against New Zealand. The bowler’s emotion was evident as the curtain came down on a World Cup game that will probably be her last – as it will almost certainly be, too, for Sciver’s fiancee, Katherine Brunt. If this is the moment that both women call time on their international careers, it will be one they can be proud to have been part of.",Sport/Sport,Nat Sciver’s genius could not save England but did rescue the game against Australia | Emma John,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/03/nat-scivers-genius-could-not-save-england-but-did-rescue-the-game-against-australia
4/3/2022,"Some high-profile projects linked to actor Will Smith are stalled or under threat after his violent slap of comic Chris Rock during the recent Oscars ceremony, Hollywood media outlets have reported. The moves would be the latest blow to Smith following the altercation on stage at at the 94th Academy Awards show which followed Rock making a joke mocking Smith’s wife, actor Jada Pinkett Smith, and her medical condition alopecia, which causes hair loss. Streaming giant Netflix has slowed development on its upcoming action-thriller Fast and Loose, which Smith was set to star in, Variety reported. The movie trade publication added that a search for a new director for the film had been paused and added “…it remains uncertain whether Netflix will return to developing Fast and Loose and, if so, whether the streamer would seek a new star for the project.” The Hollywood Reporter also said that Apple+ had declined to comment on its drama Emancipation – about escaping from slavery – which had been expected to be released this year starring Smith but currently has not had a firm date attached to it. The film news magazine also said that Sony was pausing its Smith-linked action film Bad Boys 4 , which had been in “active development” before the Oscars. As the fallout from the controversy continues Smith last week resigned from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences saying that he “betrayed the trust of the Academy” and will accept “any further consequences”. In a statement released Friday, Smith said his actions were “shocking, painful, and inexcusable”.",Arts/Film,Will Smith projects reportedly stalled or under threat after Oscars slap,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/03/will-smith-projects-stalled-under-threat-oscars-slap-report
4/3/2022,"Heather Knight has said she takes “a lot of pride” in her England side, despite their defeat against Australia in the World Cup final in Christchurch on Sunday after Nat Sciver hit an unbeaten century to take England to within 72 runs of their mammoth 357-run target. “The character and the resilience in the group to turn it around after those first three games when we were in a pretty tough situation shows volumes about this group and the people that we’ve got in it, and the staff that we’ve got, to get here with a chance of winning,” Knight said. “We can take a lot of pride in what we’ve done as a group – the way we’ve fought throughout the competition to be in this position, and the way we fought today.” Knight labelled Alyssa Healy’s match-winning knock of 170 from 138 balls – the highest individual score ever by a player in a World Cup final – “outstanding, one of the best I’ve seen live”, and said her bowlers had found it “hard to shut her down”. Healy, who was not part of the playing XI last time Australia won the tournament in 2013, said that she was proud to have been able to contribute to the win. “I ran drinks for the whole 2013 World Cup, and we didn’t make the final in 2017, so for me this trophy means a lot,” she said. “To have done what we’ve done over the last five years – the trophy in our hands is the final piece of the puzzle that needed to happen.” England’s uneven performance across the tournament, following hot on the heels of their weak performance in the Ashes, will raise questions about the quality of the English domestic structure, which is still a way behind Australia’s fully professional set-up despite the success of the Hundred last summer. But Knight described the current structure as being “in a good place”. “Things will only improve over the next couple of years, there’ll be a few more domestic contracts I imagine and a few more seasoned pros,” she said. “It might take a little bit of time – Australia started their domestic set-up and the investment in the women’s game a little bit earlier than we did – but hopefully it will bear fruit in the next couple of years.” Healy, meanwhile, stressed that a change in culture across the entire Australian playing squad after the disappointment of being knocked out by India in the 2017 semi-final was the key factor in their triumph. Since that occasion, Australia have not lost a one-day series, and last year they achieved a record-breaking 26-match winning sequence. “I’m so proud of this group to be able to reinvent [ODI cricket],” Healy said. “We came together as a squad and said: ‘This is how we want to play our cricket from now on, and we’re going to be the best team in the world.’ For all 15 people in our squad to buy into that has been unbelievable.”",Sport/Sport,Heather Knight takes pride in England revival despite World Cup final defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/03/knight-takes-pride-in-england-revival-despite-world-cup-final-defeat
