2/28/2022,"A chapter leader in the far-right Proud Boys extremist gang was charged with assault Sunday in Akron, Ohio, after he was recorded shouting racial epithets at a black woman and then sucker-punching her in the face. A man police identified as Andrew Walls, 26, was caught on video outside a bar in the early hours of Sunday, stumbling and scuffling with other patrons while spewing a torrent of racial slurs. His victim, 23-year-old Cameron Morgan, was passing by with a friend when she heard Walls and others around him screaming “Fucking niggers.” She later told her father that she confronted Walls after realizing she was the only Black person around. “We were like ... ‘You can’t say that. That’s not OK,’” she told her dad, local teacher and former sportswriter David Lee Morgan Jr., who recorded the conversation and provided a transcript to HuffPost. Video taken by Cameron Morgan’s friend shows what happened next: Walls squares up, points his finger at Morgan, and repeats the racist slur, adding: “Bitch, shut your mouth.” He then cocks his right fist and punches her directly in the face, the impact of which releases a blood-curdling pop. Morgan was treated for a concussion. WARNING: The video below contains graphic violence and racist language. Walls kept going after the recording ended, and dragged Cameron into the street by her hair, her father said. She was shaken up, he said, and left the scene without initially calling police. But once the video began to make the rounds on social media Sunday, activists quickly identified the assailant as Walls. They also unearthed a previous story about him in the local Akron Beacon Journal, which identified him as the vice president of the Akron-Canton chapter of the Proud Boys. According to this article (with photo) Andrew Walls is also the vice-president of the Akron-Canton chapter of the Proud Boys. https://t.co/mv9ZThIxBL — Steven Sean Laing (@Venusisaband) February 27, 2022 Though Walls wasn’t wearing his Proud Boys uniform — a black and yellow Fred Perry polo — during the assault, his membership in the gang suggests a predisposition for violence and bigotry. The Proud Boys, designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center and a terrorist organization by Canada, have close ties to white supremacist groups and other extremists, and violence is literally written into their rules. (The gang’s highest rank, known as the Fourth Degree, is given only to members who commit a significant act of violence “for the cause.”) Walls’ chapter didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Reached by phone Sunday, David Morgan’s voice trembled as he recalled waking up to see a video on his phone of his daughter being assaulted. “Soon as we saw it, I was in tears,” he said. “I just cried, because, I just watched somebody punch my daughter, who wouldn’t hurt a fly. Morgan said his daughter went to an urgent care clinic and was treated for a concussion after she saw stars and blacked out. Her face swelled up temporarily, to the point where she couldn’t move her jaw. “She couldn’t really open up her mouth to eat,” he said. Walls was charged with possessing a firearm while intoxicated and assault, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. The severity of Cameron’s injuries may lead to his assault charge being upgraded to a felony, the Akron Beacon Journal reports. Akron police are also considering an added ethnic intimidation charge. David Morgan said the revelation of Walls’ Proud Boys affiliation changed everything for him. He said he was aware of the gang and the national tour of political violence they’d been on since their founding in 2016, but he “never thought it would hit home until today.” “This changes a lot for me, in the sense that, I want to get involved now,” he said. “This happening was time for me to wake the hell up. And I hate that my daughter had to suffer that for me to wake the hell up.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

2/28/2022,"The UK government is considering banning all Russian ships from docking at British ports. It comes as an oil tanker owned by Russia's Sovcomflot is scheduled to dock in Scotland on Tuesday. A UK politician has called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to sanction Sovcomflot and ban Russian ships. The UK government is looking at potentially banning Russian ships from sailing into British ports after concerns over a Russian oil tanker's expected docking in the UK on Tuesday. The NS Champion, owned by Russian shipping company Sovcomflot, is set to arrive at Flotta Terminal in Orkney, Scotland, on Tuesday, according to ship-tracking site Vessel Finder. More than 3,000 people have signed a petition calling for Sovcomflot's vessel to be refused entry into Flotta's port, and to ban other Russian ships docking at UK ports. Alistair Carmichael, a Scottish politician who is a Member of Parliament for Orkney and Shetland, tweeted that he has urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson to stop Russian-owned vessels, including the NS Champion, from entering British ports. ""It is imperative that you should act without delay to ensure that Sovcomflot is sanctioned and denied access for their vessels to British ports,"" Carmichael said in the letter to Johnson, which he posted on Twitter. An Orkney Islands Council spokesperson told The Guardian that the government has said the Russian ship can't be refused to dock. ""We recognise the strength of feeling around this – feelings that we share – but we are bound by our legal obligations to accept the vessel, until such a time as the UK government tells us otherwise,"" the spokesperson told The Guardian. The Orkney Islands Council didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. A spokesperson for the UK government told Insider that it's aware of the concerns about Russian ships docking in the UK and is ""working rapidly to explore a range of measures to restrict access for them."" Meanwhile, Turkey has banned all of Russia's warships from accessing the Black Sea, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said on Saturday. A ban on Russian-owned vessels would add to the sanctions placed on the country since its invasion of Ukraine last week. The UK, and now the European Union, have banned all Russian airlines and planes from operating in their airspace.

2/28/2022,"US officials are questioning Putin's grip on reality as Russia attacks Ukraine, per the NYT. Putin placed Russia's nuclear arsenal at a high alert on Sunday, raising the stakes in the conflict. Some believe he may be acting crazy to deter action from the West, The Times reported. US intelligence agencies are urgently debating the possibility that President Vladimir Putin of Russia has lost touch with reality, reported The New York Times Sunday. It follows a series of erratic public performances by the Russian leader, and gained a new intensity after he increased Russia's level of nuclear readiness Sunday. Last week, Putin in a televised national security council meeting humiliated and berated his foreign intelligence chief, Sergey Naryshkin. Later, in a paranoid and grievance-filled speech broadcast moments before the launch of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last week, he sought to re-write history by denying that Ukraine exists as an independent country. Putin had been previously seen as brutal but a coldly rational actor. Yet some believe that his isolation during the COVID pandemic, when he tightly restricted his interactions with the wider world, may have impacted his sense of reality. His recent meetings with top officials and foreign leaders have been bizarre spectacles, with the Russian leader seated at one end of a huge table and the dignitaries at another in an apparent bid to keep infection at bay. ""He's out at his compound, doesn't come into town very much, and, under Covid, he's been more isolated,"" said Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia, in a Sunday appearance on NBC's ""Meet The Press."" James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, echoed the view in a CNN interview. ""I personally think he's unhinged,"" Clapper said. ""I worry about his acuity and balance."" Another school of thought among US intelligence officials, according to the Times, is that Putin's behavior may be an elaborate bluff. By this theory, he is acting the part of the madman in order to confuse and disconcert the West. According to the Times report, the assessment is part of a vast array of material being used by President Joe Biden's administration to judge its response. It's a version of President Richard Nixon's so-called ""madman theory,"" with the former US president in 1969 bluffing that he was willing to launch a nuclear strike on Vietnam. His hope — which did not come to pass — was that North Vietnamese leaders would quickly come to the negotiating table and end the Vietnam War. Michael A Horowitz, a security analyst at Le Beck Institute, picked up on the idea. He wrote: ""There is a 'Madman theory' in international relations, which is basically to intentionally appear irrational - not to say, cray cray - so as to force your adversary to be cautious. If this is what Putin is doing, then he is frighteningly good at it."" —Michael A. Horowitz (@michaelh992) February 21, 2022 The nature of Putin's intentions has long been one of the key questions of the Ukraine crisis. Many western analysts believed wrongly that Putin had been bluffing when he threatened invasion by massing his forces on the Ukrainian border in order to extract security concessions from the West. Those predictions turned out to be wrong, as last week Putin ordered a full scale invasion, tipping Europe into its gravest security crisis for decades.

2/28/2022,"Turkish officials on Sunday called Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine a ""war,"" a change in rhetoric that could pave the way for Turkey to block the passage of Russian warships to the Black Sea.

Ukraine's ambassador to Turkey had earlier urged the country to shut the straits to Russian warships. Up until now, Turkey had avoided referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a war, merely saying that Russia's actions violated Ukraine's ""political unity and integrity"" and were ""unacceptable."" What they're saying: ""On the fourth day of the Ukraine war, we repeat President Erdoğan’s call for an immediate halt of Russian attacks and the start of ceasefire negotiations,"" Ibrahim Kalin, a spokesperson for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, tweeted Sunday. ""We will continue our efforts to help the people of Ukraine and end bloodshed in this unjust and unlawful war,"" he added.

2/28/2022,"STORY: Tens of thousands were ordered to evacuate as heavy rains smashed Australia's east coast on Monday (February 28) submerging towns and stranding residents on rooftops. Nine people have been killed since the downpour began last Thursday, and rescue teams were searching on Monday for at least four people reported missing. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said defense personnel would be deployed to flood-hit areas to lead both rescue and recovery operations. ""Everything is being done, that can be done, to support people right across south east Queensland and indeed in the even more crisis situations that we are now seeing in northern New South Wales. The flood event there is -- they're used to floods just like in Queensland, in northern New South Wales. But the floods we're seeing in Lismore, they have not seen. They have not seen them before and people who are in areas that have never been touched by floods have been overnight and that is a crisis situation."" The rising waters caught people by surprise in the New South Wales city of Lismore as its near 30,000 residents were forced to leave their homes immediately. ""You've lived here all your life. We've lived in this house here for almost 30 years. Never seen anything like this. No, never."" ""I'm waiting for my parents and my mum, my brother, my dad and two dogs to come out from South Lismore."" The Bureau of Meteorology warned the city's Wilsons River could reach around 14.4 meters on Monday afternoon, surpassing the last peak back in 1954.
