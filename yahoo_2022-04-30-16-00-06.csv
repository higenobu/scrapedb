4/30/2022,"A Hooters waitress is going viral after breaking down her daily earnings in tips. TikToker Leah Fennelly (@leah_fennelly) shared the info during a video posted in late March. According to her page, Fennelly works at Hooters in addition to attending law school, and she often posts revealing details about the job. What is inflation and what causes it? Her video about tips, however, was particularly popular. In the clip, which now has over 10 million views, Fennelly counted her tips in the course of a normal Thursday at work. The clip is similar to recent TikToks from other restaurant employees. In another viral video, a 20-year-old Waffle House worker surprised many viewers by sharing how much she makes at her job. Before that, a waitress went viral after asking her coworkers to share their biggest on-the-job “pet peeves.” Fennelly’s video drew similar praise for its transparency. In the TikTok, Fennelly counts her tips during an eight-hour shift. Most of her tips are in the single digits, but she gets a few big boosts — including a regular who paid her $100 on Cash App after sitting at her table for “so long.” When it was all said and done, Fennelly made $382 in tips. Many commenters were impressed by the waitress’s reaction to her earnings. “It’s so refreshing to see you being so grateful even for the not so large tips,” one user wrote. Guys, here's how to pick the perfect first date outfit: “The ONLY person i seen that appreciates little tips no matter what,” another added. Fennelly wrote in the comments that customers typically tip less during lunch, and that she often makes more during later shifts. However, as some users pointed out, $382 is still a pretty good haul. “You guys keep saying so little money but she literally made $42 an hour for an 8 hour shift…” one user wrote. ""I'm working at the wrong restaurant,"" another agreed. The video also sparked a debate about tipping culture in America. It’s a common theme on TikTok, as videos like Fennelly’s give users from outside the U.S. insight into the system. “In the UK those tips would be 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 (and some change),” one user wrote. Earlier this year, another waitress spurred a similar debate after revealing that a customer had asked for her number — after leaving a $0 tip. Before that, a group of restaurant customers drew mixed reviews after filming themselves trying to tip with an Amazon gift card.

4/30/2022,"By Martin Quin Pollard and David Stanway BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's capital Beijing closed more businesses and residential compounds on Friday, with authorities ramping up contact tracing to contain a COVID-19 outbreak, while resentment at the month-long lockdown in Shanghai grew. In the finance hub, fenced-in people have been protesting against the lockdown and difficulties in obtaining provisions by banging on pots and pans in the evenings, according to a Reuters witness and residents. A video shared on social media, whose authenticity could not be immediately verified, showed a woman warning people via a loud-hailer not to do so, saying such gestures were being encouraged by ""outsiders."" The Shanghai government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In Beijing, authorities were in a race against time to detect COVID cases and isolate those who have been around them. A sign placed outside a residential complex read ""Entry only. No exit."" Polish resident Joanna Szklarska, 51, was sent to a quarantine hotel as a close contact, but she refused to share the room, which had only one bed, with her neighbour. She was sent back home, where authorities installed a front door alarm. Then she was called back to the hotel, where she now has her own room. ""Nothing makes sense here,"" the English-language consultant said by phone. At a regular press conference on Friday, Chinese health officials did not respond to questions on whether Beijing will go under lockdown or what circumstances might prompt such measures. The severe curbs in China have appeared surreal to many parts of the world where people have chosen to live with the virus. And the frequent signs of frustration among citizens will be uncomfortable for China's ruling Communist Party, especially as President Xi Jinping is widely expected to secure a third leadership term this fall. Nomura estimates 46 cities are currently in full or partial lockdowns, affecting 343 million people. Societe Generale estimates that provinces experiencing significant mobility restrictions account for 80% of China's economic output. 'HELLO CITIZENS!' New COVID cases in Beijing remain in the dozens, officials said on Friday, a far cry from Shanghai's numbers. In Beijing's Chaoyang district, the first to undergo mass testing this week, started the last of three rounds of screening on Friday among its 3.5 million residents. Most other districts are due for their third round of tests on Saturday. More apartment blocks were sealed, preventing residents from leaving, and certain spas, KTV lounges, gyms, cinemas and libraries and at least two shopping malls closed on Friday. People who had recently visited venues in areas authorities declared as ""at risk"" have received text messages telling them to stay put until they get their test results. ""Hello citizens! You have recently visited the beef noodles & braised chicken shop in Guanghui Li community,"" one such text read. ""Please report to your compound or hotel immediately, stay put and wait for the notification of nucleic acid testing."" ""If you violate the above requirements and cause the epidemic to spread, you will bear legal responsibility."" 'PEOPLE'S WAR' The April 30-May 4 Labour Day break is one of China's busiest tourist seasons, and the travel industry is taking losses. Companies reopening factories in Shanghai are booking hotel rooms to house workers and turning vacant workshops into on-site isolation facilities as authorities urge them to resume work under COVID curbs. Many foreigners want to flee mainland China's most cosmopolitan city. In response to COVID and other headwinds, China will step up policy support for the economy, a top decision-making body of the Communist Party said on Friday, lifting stocks from recent two-year lows. Details were scarce, but markets reacted to a shift in messaging away from the single-focus on COVID, analysts say. ""Now the goal is to balance containing outbreaks and economic growth,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, president of Pinpoint Asset Management, who expects China's economy to contract in the second quarter. ""This suggests the government may fine-tune the 'zero tolerance' policy to allow some flexibility."" Chinese authorities say fighting COVID is vital to save lives. ""The battle against the COVID epidemic is a war, a war of resistance, a people’s war,"" said Liang Wannian, head of the National Health Commission's COVID response panel. In Shanghai, authorities said more people have been gradually allowed in principle to leave their homes recently. More than 12 million, nearly half the population, are now in that category. Still, many cannot leave their compounds, while those who can have few places to go as shops and other venues are closed. Often one of the 52,000 police mobilised for the lockdown asks them to return home. Many residents have grumbled at the inflexible policing, which sometimes does not take into account health emergencies or other individual circumstances. ""Some individual policemen...are emotional or mechanical,"" Shu Qing, head of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, told reporters, admitting ""shortcomings.""

4/30/2022,"Amber Heard pledged to donate $3.5 million of her divorce settlement with Johnny Depp to the ACLU. The ACLU's COO and general counsel testified Thursday the organization received only $1.3 million. He said the nonprofit believed $500,000 of the sum came from Elon Musk, whom Heard dated after Depp. When Johnny Depp and Amber Heard reached a settlement in their divorce in 2016, Heard announced that she would donate the entirety of her $7 million payout to charity. She said the money would be split between two organizations: the American Civil Liberties Union and Children's Hospital Los Angeles. But the ACLU said it never received the full $3.5 million it was promised and believed about half the donations it received in Heard's name came from Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla whom Heard started dating after her breakup with Depp. Terence Dougherty, the general counsel and chief operating officer of the ACLU, spoke about Heard's donations to the nonprofit in a prerecorded deposition played on Thursday in Depp's defamation trial against Heard. Depp has accused Heard of ruining his reputation and career by insinuating that she had been the victim of domestic violence in a 2018 Washington Post op-ed. Heard has denied Depp's defamation allegations and says he physically assaulted her on multiple occasions before and during their marriage. Dougherty said the ACLU received four donations in Heard's name, which totaled $1.3 million. Only one of those payments was from Heard directly: a payment for $350,000 in August 2016. The other payments were a $100,000 check from Depp, $500,000 from a donor-advised fund at Vanguard, and $350,000 from a donor-advised fund at Fidelity. Dougherty said the ACLU believed the $500,000 Vanguard payment was from a fund set up by Musk. Musk had emailed Anthony Romero, the executive director of the ACLU, indicating that Heard would donate the total $3.5 million over a 10-year period, Dougherty testified. ""Amber, I described your plan to donate $3.5 million to the ACLU over the next 10 years as you very much believe what you were doing,"" Musk wrote in an email sent to Romero in August 2016. Heard hasn't donated the rest of the money, and she never signed a pledge form that ACLU staffers prepared for her, Dougherty said. Heard asked the ACLU not to issue a press release about her $3.5 million pledge, Dougherty testified. In 2019, when the ACLU expected the next installment, it never came, he said. ""We reached out to Heard starting in 2019 for the next installment of her giving, and we learned that she was having financial difficulties,"" Dougherty said. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the donation in Heard's name. A representative for Heard also didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Within months of Depp and Heard's split in May 2016, rumors started to swirl about her dating Musk. In text messages shown in court on Wednesday, Heard acknowledged to her former agent that she never really loved Musk. Reports that they had broken up came out in August 2017. In December 2018 on the same day Heard's op-ed in The Washington Post was published, Heard announced she had taken on a role as an ACLU ambassador on women's rights. ACLU lawyers — including David Cole, the national legal director who has argued before the Supreme Court numerous times — had helped draft the op-ed, Dougherty testified. After Twitter announced on Monday that it reached a deal for Musk to purchase the platform for $44 billion, the ACLU described the billionaire as ""one of our most significant supporters"" but said people should be anxious over the prospective effects of his ownership. ""We should be worried about any powerful central actor, whether it's a government or any wealthy individual — even if it's an ACLU member — having so much control over the boundaries of our political speech online,"" Romero said in a statement.

4/30/2022,"Ripon police on Thursday released the cause of death for two women whose bodies were found in a vehicle in the Stanislaus River after they attended a wedding earlier this month. Alyssa Ros, 23, of Long Beach and Xylona Anita Gama, 22, of Stockton drowned after Gama drove off an approximately 19-foot embankment and into the river on the southeast side of the golf course at the Spring Creek Country Club, according to Ripon Police Chief Ed Ormonde. He said their deaths have been classified as an accident. The friends attended a wedding at the country club on April 3 and were supposed to go to Ros’ father’s house in Modesto afterward, but they never arrived. The families of both women reported them missing and on April 5, an employee at the golf course spotted Gama’s vehicle submerged in the river. Ros’ father told The Bee the vehicle was upside down in about eight feet of water. Ormonde said the women left the wedding around 10:22 p.m. and surveillance footage captured them traveling south from the parking lot onto a golf cart path. The path is west of the clubhouse, between the driving range and tee box for the first hole, he said. It is undetermined if alcohol or drugs were a factor in the accident. Toxicology reports are still pending, Ormonde said.",U.S./Modesto Bee,Causes of death released for women found in Stanislaus River after wedding in Ripon,https://news.yahoo.com/causes-death-released-women-found-195909365.html
