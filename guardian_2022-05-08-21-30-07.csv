5/8/2022,"Her appointment made history as Durham police’s first female chief constable. But for a second time during her three-year tenure, Jo Farrell has found herself at the centre of a national row over a police investigation that could have consequences for the UK’s political landscape. Durham constabulary on Friday said it would investigate claims that Sir Keir Starmer broke lockdown rules after days of pressure from Conservative MPs and some new disclosures from right-leaning newspapers. Labour has said it will cooperate with the inquiry. In May 2020, Farrell, 53, faced similar demands to question Dominic Cummings after a Guardian and Mirror investigation disclosed that Boris Johnson’s then key adviser had broken lockdown rules within her force’s boundaries. She did not authorise her officers to question Cummings over his 260-mile trip to Durham from London or a subsequent day out to Barnard Castle to “test his eyesight”. Amid a growing row over Cummings and the police’s response, reports claimed that Farrell was the subject of formal complaints from the public angry at the force’s response to the allegations. At the time, Durham police put out a statement saying her force did not take retrospective action on lockdown breaches. “Durham constabulary has not taken retrospective action against any other person,” it said. In an interview with the Daily Mirror last month, Farrell acknowledged the huge pressure on her during the Cummings furore, and said the decision not to question Cummings during a three-day investigation was made in line with her force’s aim to remain neutral. “We are apolitical, so it was my job to make sure that there was a proportionate line. Had we stopped him when he was driving to Barnard Castle, we would have told him to turn around and go back. “Thousands of people have lost their lives in the pandemic so, yes, we never took any of this lightly. But we could not be influenced by the huge political feeling about him as an individual and his role within the government,” she said. She told the Mirror that the force treated Cummings’s televised press conference in Downing Street’s rose garden as a witness statement about his behaviour instead. In May 2021, Cummings admitted to MPs that he did not tell the whole truth in the rose garden. Farrell can now expect to be asked to explain whether her force has caved in to political pressure over the decision to open an inquiry into the “Beergate” claims against Starmer. And once again, her force’s every move during the inquiry will be closely scrutinised by politicians and the media. Born in Wirral, Farrell and her family moved to Cambridgeshire when she was 15. After a degree in business at Sheffield Polytechnic, she joined the police as a constable in Cambridge in 1991 before moving to Northumbria police. There, she was in charge of firearms on the night that the biggest manhunt in recent criminal history ended with the death of the killer Raoul Moat, who shot himself when cornered by police. She joined Durham constabulary in November 2016 and was appointed Chief Constable in June 2019, becoming the first woman to hold the post in the force’s 180-year history. On a national level, she works on behalf of the National Police Chiefs Council in the areas of information management and criminal justice file quality, and supports the Crimestoppers charity. She is married to a retired police officer and has two stepsons and a daughter. Away from work, Farrell says she enjoys family life, cooking and keeping fit.",News/UK news,From Barnard Castle to ‘Beergate’: Durham police chief at centre of national row again,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/08/from-barnard-castle-to-beergate-durham-police-chief-at-centre-of-national-row-again
5/8/2022,"The Dutch writer Lieke Marsman has established herself in this country as a poet of exceptional skill with her collection The Following Scan Will Last Five Minutes (2019), which was inspired by her diagnosis of a rare form of bone cancer at the age of 27. Her debut novel, The Opposite of a Person, predates that collection, but is appearing in English now, translated, like her poetry, with empathy and clarity by Sophie Collins. It feels in a sense like the most modern book you could read: not only is the ostensible subject timely (climate change), but it also falls into a number of current literary trends. For example, we are used in nonfiction to the genre-defying book – it is practically de rigueur now for nonfiction to blend essay, memoir and reportage – but Marsman brings this style to her novel, which combines fiction, essays and poetry. It also falls into what we might call “space literature”, a narrative formed of short paragraphs surrounded by white space, as practised by authors such as Jenny Offill and Sarah Manguso, who use it to build gradual effects. Marsman’s narrator is Ida, a climatologist in a relationship with another woman, Robin. Ida has been invited to take up an internship in the Italian Alps, where she will learn more about the human impact on the climate and about plans to demolish a hydroelectric dam: a symbol of that human impact. Ida struggles to feel that she fits in – Collins in her translator’s note speculates that Ida is “neurologically atypical” – and, based on her mother’s assertion that people are evil, in childhood she wanted to be “the opposite of a person”. “I tried to ensure this by first of all learning to walk on my hands” and later “speaking as little as possible”. This laconic approach persists in her narrative, where we don’t learn much about Ida’s relationship with Robin until the end, when a dramatic development comes that feels unearned. The prose is much more persuasive when in essay or reportage form; Marsman writes powerfully on natural as well as man-made disasters. The essays spliced through the fiction are complex and rewarding and, like the narrative, address the question of belonging, reflecting, for example, on the limits of identity politics. “I regularly visit websites designed for lesbians and obediently watch every new film or series featuring a lesbian protagonist,” says Ida, noting that “a shared sexuality is no guarantee of a good conversation”. And it all leads back to the unignorable subject of climate change, which Ida links, in a fascinating essay on Copernicus, to humankind’s historic insistence that we must be at the centre of the world. “Men are wretched by necessity,” she writes, quoting Giacomo Leopardi, “and determined to consider themselves wretched by accident.” Ida, when reflecting on her struggles with people, observes that books are “friends” that are “funny, clever and available twenty-four hours a day”. Well, it’s not a laugh riot – what report of climate change is? – but otherwise, that’s a description you could apply to her own story.

5/8/2022,"“Not another love song,” Ella Mai sighed on her comeback single of that title. She clearly wasn’t listening to herself. Like the British R&B star’s eponymous debut, Heart on My Sleeve is packed with love songs. Slow love songs, mid-paced love songs, some even slower love songs. No matter. While there’s nothing as obviously stellar as Grammy-winning US Top 5 hit Boo’d Up or its even better sequel, Trip, Ella has always had a gift for parsing the everyday dramas of twentysomething relationships in relatable (and sometimes 18-rated) language. While her first album was happiest in its nostalgic 90s groove, there’s greater ambition now. Fallen Angel is magically odd, like Beyoncé headlining Kanye’s Sunday Service, built on a tricksy, rattling rhythm suffused with eerie choral harmonies, corralled by a wayward preacher. Pieces and Trying also confidently future-proof Mai’s sound, although some may find the production too stridently digital. Maybe there could be more London grit amid the generic American gloss, which lets unwieldy basketball terms such as “full-court press” loose in otherwise blameless love songs. Still, given how feeble the British music industry is at nurturing R&B talent, we should probably give her a pass.

5/8/2022,"There is a staggering vision in this exhibition of a woman’s head pressed against the bars of a window, her beautiful face enduring and forlorn. She is carved from a block of medieval limestone. The sculpture irresistibly calls upon your desire to break the bars and free the head, or at the very least reach inside to touch her sorrowful cheek. For refusing to marry, Saint Avia was imprisoned in a solitary cell with a view of the world she can see but never reach. The empathy of the anonymous French artist almost beggars belief. I have never seen anything like it. Reframed: The Woman in the Window, at Dulwich Picture Gallery, is filled with revelations. Here is Botticelli’s steely Renaissance redhead looking out from a triple-aspect chamber, fingers suggestively clasping the window – and breaking the frame; and Gabriel Metsu’s African woman seated behind a stone sill in red velvet and pearls in the 17th century. Here is Rachel Lowe’s mesmerising film of her poignant attempts to capture the beauty of the passing landscape in marker pen on the car window. And Louise Bourgeois’s actual Manhattan window, rusty but treasured for the views it gave her in old age, which are reprised here in painted homages behind the panes. Men frame women; women reframe themselves. That is one of the show’s many art historical themes, superbly presented across two millennia. For the oldest work here dates right back to 900BC, when a Phoenician artist carved the face of a temple prostitute on a piece of ivory, staring out of a window with such abrupt and defiant frontality as to make the viewer reel back. Who is looking at whom? As an added shock, this carving conclusively proves that Dutch golden age artists had no monopoly on the woman and window concept, as often claimed. You look with new eyes at the gallery’s own celebrated Rembrandt of a rosy-cheeked girl leaning on a window ledge; and, not incidentally, at the narrow historical responses that focus on whether she was a housemaid or a prostitute, ignoring her blithe spirit expressed in paint. A window is essentially a frame within a frame that might act as a stage – the woman on the balcony – or as a domestic prison, echoed by all the caged birds here in European paintings. But what it emphasises, almost inevitably, is looking. A woman is looking out, or we are spying on her; we catch her unawares, or the artist holds her in his sights. Picasso’s huge black and white aquatint shows his sometime lover Françoise Gilot with her hands pressed against a window. She sees what we cannot, and he sees a kind of urgency, as if she were trying to get out. A doorknob intrudes on the right. Go on then, leave. It is an extraordinarily pressurised image. And it is taken up, in the show’s high theatre of connections, in Wolfgang Tillmans’s lifesize photograph of the DJ Smokin Jo pressing her fingers at a windowpane with immense yet delicate force. And again, in the meeting of beloved fingertips on either side of city windows during lockdown, so beautifully photographed by Simran Janjua. The sightlines are riveting. You look through a pierced Mughal screen and beyond it glimpse an Indian miniature of two women appearing at a window like performers in a play, arms around each other, their smiles exquisitely expressive, the smallest details – the tassel of a blind, a flower projecting across the frame – giving the sense of a world outside the window. A knee touching a pane, a shadow behind a filigree screen, a tumble of Rapunzel locks cascading from an open window: we infer the female presence almost without thinking. But the show precisely invites to reconsider. The woman palming her hand against a man viewing her through a car window – or is it the camera she is blocking in Andrew Jackson’s photograph Hand #1? Cindy Sherman’s blonde starlet looking down from her window ledge – is she on the verge of a breakthrough or being manipulated by some offstage Hitchcock in Untitled Film Still? The most ambiguous image here is one of the greatest: Degas’s stupendous Woman at a Window (1871), on loan from the Courtauld. You barely see the woman at first, backlit against the window in the tawny brown glow of the Paris interior. She is still as a heron in the shadows. The shutters are open and the light strikes out her face with its dazzle, so that whatever she thinks and feels remains her own. It is a painting about how we glance at a scene, as much as how light gives us both visibility and shadow, pouring in through our windows. This a show to make you look harder and think longer about both art and life; about the depiction of women, the experience of seeing and being seen. Superbly curated by Jennifer Sliwka, it is enthralling, imaginative and constantly surprising. The selection is so intelligent, the texts so stimulating and the design so creative – transforming every inch of the narrow enfilade space, a lesson to larger museums everywhere – as to amount to a reframing, in itself, of what an exhibition can be.

5/8/2022,"Despite everything that has happened to her country since the Taliban seized power last August, 29-year old Nafisa still never believed there would come a day when she would be unable to feel the sun on her face as she walked the streets of Kabul. Yet on Saturday, the Taliban’s sinisterly named ministry for the propagation of virtue ordered that Nafisa, along with millions of women across Afghanistan, should ideally not leave the house at all. If they do, they must be fully veiled and never show their faces in public. “The Taliban has no plans for Afghanistan other than imposing restrictions on women,” says Nafisa, who says she rejects the Taliban’s latest attempts to push Afghan women into the shadows. “I do not accept the obligatory hijab and I will never wear a burqa.” The new restrictions require women to either wear a burqa, the head-to-toe covering that only allows women to see through a small grille at eye-level or a full niqab, which covers the face but not the eyes. Most Afghan women already wear some form of hijab, but many in cities such as Kabul previously only covered their hair.Along with the decree, the Taliban issued a detailed set of restrictions and punishments that leave women’s family members responsible for their compliance and facing fines and jail if they are seen in public uncovered. If women working for the government go out without their face veiled they will be fired and Taliban fighters will also lose their jobs if their female relatives fail to obey the new restrictions. For many women in Kabul, the decree comes on the back of a campaign of harassment and violence at the hands of the Taliban and their street enforcers that has been mounting in recent months. Young women in the capital who before last summer had never lived under Taliban rule say the religious police force has been emboldened, roaming the streets of the city looking for excuses to question, intimidate and beat women for wearing colourful clothes, jeans or travelling without a male companion. Nazanin, a public university student, was beaten by the Taliban for sitting in the front seat of a taxi about two weeks ago in Kabul. “They lashed me two times across my back. It felt like my bones were broken.” Nazanin said after she was beaten, the taxi driver was arrested and taken to the police station. Shabnam, 23, who lives in Kabul, says she does not feel safe walking in the streets any more. Three weeks ago Taliban fighters stopped her 12-year old cousin, held her down and cut her hair in public because it was not fully covered by a scarf. Shortly after, her cousin and her family fled the country. “The Taliban have taken away my very basic right, which is the right to choose my own clothes, and this is very painful for me,” she says. At the beginning of the year, the Taliban arrested several women who protested against the forced hijab and held them in an unknown location until they were forced to release them following international outrage.The latest restrictions are part a concerted campaign to roll back decades of advances in women’s rights across the country. When it seized power in August 2021, the Taliban claimed they had changed and would respect women’s right to a public life but since then have taken away the right of women to travel alone, to work outside healthcare and to education. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) condemned the face veil decree as the latest attack on women’s rights but said it believed it would become strictly enforced despite widespread international condemnation. “Information that UNAMA has received suggests this is a formal directive rather than a recommendation, and that it will be implemented and enforced,” it said.

5/8/2022,"Thieves are targeting digital currency investors on the street in a wave of “crypto muggings”, police have warned, with victims reporting that thousands of pounds have been stolen after their mobile phones were seized. Anonymised crime reports provided to the Guardian by City of London police, as part of a freedom of information request, reveal criminals are combining physical muscle with digital knowhow to part people from their cryptocurrency. One victim reported they had been trying to order an Uber near London’s Liverpool Street station when muggers forced them to hand over their phone. While the gang eventually gave the phone back, the victim later realised that £5,000 worth of ethereum digital currency was missing from their account with the crypto investing platform Coinbase. In another case, a man was approached by a group of people offering to sell him cocaine and agreed to go down an alley with them to do the deal. The men offered to type a number into his phone but instead accessed his cryptocurrency account, holding him against a wall and forcing him to unlock a smartphone app with facial verification. They transferred £6,000 worth of ripple, another digital currency, out of his account. A third victim said he had been vomiting under a bridge when a mugger forced him to unlock his phone using a fingerprint, then changed his security settings and stole £28,700, including cryptocurrency. In another case, a victim told police that his cards and phone were pickpocketed after an evening at the pub, with £10,000 later stolen from their account with the investing platform Crypto.com. The victim was using his phone in the pub and believed thieves saw him type in his account pin, the report said. “It’s a sort of crypto mugging,” said David Gerard, the author of Attack on the 50 Foot Blockchain, a book on digital currencies. Cryptocurrency transfers are irreversible, unlike a bank transfer, making this type of crime more attractive to thieves. “If I get robbed and they force me to make a bank transfer, the bank can trace where the money has gone and there are all sorts of comebacks. You can reverse the transaction. “With crypto, if I transfer it to my crypto wallet, I’ve got your coins and you can’t get them back.” He said the risks were exacerbated by the way some people handle their investments on smartphones, without exercising the same degree of caution they would with cash. “People keep stupid amounts of money on account in crypto. They don’t think it’s money somehow.” Gurvais Grigg, a 23-year veteran of the FBI, now works as public sector chief technology officer for Chainalysis, which helps government agencies and financial institutions track movements of digital currency. He said the nature of cryptocurrency, where transactions are logged on the blockchain, meant police should, in theory, be able to track stolen crypto. “To [transfer stolen assets], they have to provide a wallet address and, most likely, they’ll use that wallet address again in the future. You also need to bring it to an exchange if you want to turn it into fiat currency.” He said this created a digital paper trail that investigators can, and regularly do, use to track down multimillion-dollar crypto hacks. However, he said they were less likely to have the resources to pursue smaller, one-off crimes. “An individual theft of a small amount may not get the attention of the police or a large law enforcement agency. “If they could put together a larger conspiracy of activity, where people are doing it more than once or twice, police services would likely pay attention.” The crypto muggings took place in the second half of 2021, in the relatively small part of London’s financial district patrolled by City of London police. The incidents are not the first in which people have been forced to hand over cryptocurrency with the threat of violence. A student in Kent claimed last year that eight people stormed his university accommodation and forced him to transfer £68,000 of bitcoin at knifepoint. Later that year, the American technology entrepreneur Zaryn Dentzel told police he had been attacked at home in Madrid by masked thieves. He said they tortured him with a knife and taser before disappearing with millions of euros in bitcoin. However, the nature of the crimes reported in London last year – apparently opportunistic street incidents akin to a mugging for cash or valuables – is presenting new challenges for the police. Phil Ariss, who leads the cryptocurrency team on the National Police Chiefs’ Council cybercrime programme, said more training was being given to police officers on a variety of crypto-related crimes. He said police were also looking at ways to inform the public about the need to be cautious when accessing a crypto account. “You wouldn’t walk down the street holding £50 notes and counting them. That should apply to people with crypto assets,” he said.",News/Technology,‘Crypto muggings’: thieves in London target digital investors by taking phones,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/08/crypto-muggings-thieves-in-london-target-digital-investors-by-taking-phones
5/8/2022,"Ncuti Gatwa will take over from Jodie Whittaker as the Time Lord in Doctor Who, the BBC has announced. The 29-year-old will become the 14th Doctor on the popular BBC show, after Whittaker announced last July she would be leaving the role. The Scottish actor, who was born in Rwanda, starred as Eric Effiong in Netflix’s hugely popular Sex Education about the socially awkward high school student Otis (Asa Butterfield) and his sex therapist mother Jean (Gillian Anderson). Russell T Davies will return in the next series of Doctor Who as showrunner, after he initially helmed the 21st-century revival of the show from 2005 to 2009. In a statement on the official Doctor Who website, Ncuti said: “There aren’t quite the words to describe how I’m feeling. A mix of deeply honoured, beyond excited and of course a little bit scared. This role and show means so much to so many around the world, including myself, and each one of my incredibly talented predecessors has handled that unique responsibility and privilege with the utmost care. “I will endeavour my upmost to do the same. Russell T Davies is almost as iconic as the Doctor himself and being able to work with him is a dream come true. His writing is dynamic, exciting, incredibly intelligent and fizzing with danger.” Davies said: “The future is here and it’s Ncuti! Sometimes talent walks through the door and it’s so bright and bold and brilliant, I just stand back in awe and thank my lucky stars. Ncuti dazzled us, seized hold of the Doctor and owned those Tardis keys in seconds. It’s an honour to work with him, and a hoot, I can’t wait to get started.” Whittaker’s Doctor will be seen in one more episode, expected to air in autumn this year to coincide with the centenary of the BBC. She was the first woman to play the role on an ongoing basis. It was a move that initially delivered a 10-year’s ratings high, but which also courted controversy with some fans who felt the character should always be a man, and even led to one Conservative MP in parliament saying it had deprived boys of a role model and contributed to them turning to crime. When Gatwa starts his tenure in the Tardis, Doctor Who will not be produced in-house by the BBC, but by Bad Wolf Productions, a company set up by the executives Julie Gardner and Jane Tranter. Both previously worked on Doctor Who. The company is majority-owned by Sony and has previously produced TV series including A Discovery of Witches, His Dark Materials and I Hate Suzie. Gatwa will be known by fans as the 14th Doctor, despite the numbering of the actors playing Doctor Who getting increasingly jumbled over the years. While it was quite simple to count the Doctors in the show’s initial 1960s and 70s heyday, John Hurt appeared as the mysterious War Doctor in 2013 for the show’s 50th anniversary, and Jo Martin made her debut as the Fugitive Doctor in 2020. To further confuse matters, both Richard Hurndall in 1983 and David Bradley in 2017 have played on-screen versions of the “First Doctor”, originally portrayed by William Hartnell when the series began in 1963. Whittaker’s current companions – John Bishop as Dan and Mandip Gill as Yaz – will also be replaced in an all-new 2023 restart for the show. Of her character’s exit, Gill said: “I think just like me, just like my character, there’ll be a lot of tears, but I loved where it ended up.” Upon her announcement that she was leaving the role, Whittaker described it as “the best job I have ever had”, saying: “I don’t think I’ll ever be able to express what this role has given me. I will carry the Doctor and the lessons I’ve learnt forever.”",Arts/Television & radio,"Doctor Who: Ncuti Gatwa to replace Jodie Whittaker, BBC announces",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/08/doctor-who-ncuti-gatwa-to-replace-jodie-whittaker-bbc-announces
