3/7/2022,"Good morning. Ukraine has the fastest-growing refugee crisis since the second world war, the United Nations has said, as war crimes investigators begin collecting evidence. Scott Morrison is expected to warn of a “new arc of autocracy” shaping the world. And weather warnings continue in NSW, with more heavy rainfall in parts. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war, according to the UN refugee agency. The warning came as eyewitnesses described an incident in which three people trying to escape fighting in Irpin, just outside Kyiv, were killed when they were shelled by Russian forces during an organised evacuation on Sunday. With more than 1.5 million refugees from Ukraine reported to have crossed into neighbouring countries in the space of 10 days, the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, warned the situation would only get worse. A second attempt to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people from the encircled port city of Mariupol appears close to collapse after Ukraine’s national guard accused Russia of continuing to shell the humanitarian corridors. Around the world, politicians are scrambling to gain control over the situation. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, says the US and its allies are engaged in a “very active discussion” about banning the import of Russian oil and natural gas in a new escalation of sanctions. Blinken also pledged on Sunday to increase pressure on Russia through sanctions and provide more aid to Ukraine, but warned Russia held a military advantage that western allies are finding hard to counter and the war was set to last “some time”. Britain’s deputy prime minister has also said it may take years for Putin to be defeated. Meanwhile, more than 4,300 people have been arrested after demonstrators took to the streets in 21 Russian cities to condemn the invasion. Two female journalists, whose identities we are protecting, document a week that saw Russian soldiers enter the port city of Kherson. Scott Morrison is due to warn that a “new arc of autocracy” is forming to reshape the world, while pledging to build a new base for nuclear-powered submarines on Australia’s east coast. The Australian prime minister will use a key foreign policy speech on Monday to warn against “a transactional world, devoid of principle, accountability and transparency”. Morrison is also set to reveal the government has “provisioned more than $10bn” for the transition from Australia’s existing Collins class submarines to the nuclear-powered submarines to be delivered under the Aukus pact with the UK and the US. A new base, to be built in Brisbane, Newcastle or Port Kembla, will “enable the regular visiting of US and UK nuclear-powered submarines”, he will say in a virtual address to the Lowy Institute. South-east Queensland has again been lashed with rainfall and thunderstorms, while areas around Sydney and Newcastle faced the renewed risk of flooding as the cleanup continued. Destructive winds and giant hail were possible as a “very dangerous storm” near Beaudesert in Queensland moved east on Sunday afternoon. The loss of thousands of homes means renters will have fewer properties to bid for and will also be competing against flood-hit owner-occupiers. The floods have prompted the Climate Council to issue a pre-election call for all Australian political parties to acknowledge that the climate crisis is driving worsening disasters. Prominent women, including former Australian of the year Grace Tame and former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins, are launching a fresh call for the Morrison government to implement significant policies to protect women and children from violence, harassment and discrimination. Shane Warne suffered chest pains before he travelled to Thailand for a holiday, where the cricket great died from a suspected heart attack on Friday, Thai police say. Warne’s body was picked up from Koh Samui hospital on Sunday morning at 10am local time in a motorcade flanked by the Australian ambassador and local police officers. Defence minister Peter Dutton has stepped back from his earlier prediction that Australia would join a conflict to defend Taiwan, saying the government would decide “at that time as to what was in our country’s best interests”. AGL Energy has rejected a higher takeover bid from Canadian asset manager Brookfield and tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, potentially seeing off the unsolicited bid. The pair made an offer of $8.25 a share for Australia’s largest electricity generator on Friday night, topping their initial offer of $7.50 made last month, multiple sources told Guardian Australia. China has set its lowest annual GDP target in decades, as premier, Li Keqiang, warned of a “grave and uncertain” outlook against the backdrop of the coronavirus, a slowing economy and the war in Ukraine. A decision to restart operations at one of Central America’s largest nickel mines is being questioned by campaigners after an investigation appeared to show the company co-opted indigenous leaders and smeared potential opponents. The UK Home Office has agreed to pay nearly £6,000 in a settlement to an EU citizen it detained at the border in a post-Brexit crack down on Europeans entering the country last year. The release of The Batman starring Robert Pattinson is being heralded as the beginning of an anticipated post-pandemic blockbuster boom, with UK box office sales forecast to double this year to top £1bn for the first time since 2019. Why are Australians so nervous of other peoples and of justice? Why are our politicians so unambitious? Why are vulnerable people, especially young women, still routinely preyed upon almost without consequence? Why does the White Australia Policy continue to weigh so heavily on public policy? Writing about Julianne Schultz’s book on Australian identity, Melissa Lucashenko asks how we can change a nation where forgetting is essential. Sisonke Msimang has been thinking about Grace Tame a lot in the last few weeks. She’s been “wondering how to talk about her with the admiration she deserves, while asking questions about why she in particular has become the face of modern Australian feminism when there are so many other women – Black women in particular – with so much to say and with so many difficult and heart-wrenching stories of their own”. INXS is a brilliant singles band with one of rock’s sexiest frontmen, so putting together an INXS greatest hits list isn’t easy. But thankfully, Andrew Stafford has ranked them for us. The world has reacted with revulsion to stark images of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. But televisions in Moscow show a different story entirely, says Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, Andrew Roth.

Last week, when Gold Coast Suns forward Sarah Perkins tweeted an apology to supporters for missing what would have been a match winning goal against the Saints, a series of tweets followed criticising Perkins based on her body shape. Countless AFLW players, fans, and commentators rushed to Perkins’ defence, reinvigorating the debate on the dangers of social media for high-profile sports people, and driving the conversation about the right to criticise an athlete’s body in the context of performance.

3/7/2022,"As a lawyer specialising in sport and human rights I receive more than 200 messages a week about abuse in football alone. Some messages are from players, some are from whistleblowers. Almost all express fear, frustration and anger about how the system is failing. It’s not just that the abuse was allowed to happen. It’s that when they alerted the powers that be, they were ignored, gaslighted or silenced. Since 2016 I’ve worked with victims of abuse in sport across five continents. From England to Afghanistan, Argentina to Haiti, Canada to Gabon, football is being used intentionally by sexual predators as a vehicle to access, groom and abuse children and young adults. In all cases, someone knew that the abuse was taking place – often someone senior in football’s governing structures. Fifa, as football’s global governing body, is ultimately responsible for investigating allegations of abuse where national federations lack competence or alleged perpetrators are directly appointed by Fifa. This happens often and, in those cases, Fifa also decides on whether to fine and ban the perpetrators. By all accounts, Fifa has struggled on this front. It is a field in which Fifa has little experience, and its systems and procedures are better suited to tackling match-fixing and doping than abuse and discrimination. To its credit, Fifa has managed to ban two major perpetrators to date, albeit relying heavily on evidence submitted by international players’ union Fifpro who supported survivors and whistleblowers to collate accounts of the abuse that had been going on for years. Fifa has also been brave enough to acknowledge the challenge of investigating these cases, while many other federations bury their heads in the sand. It is now proposing to launch a multi-sport entity that would help sports bodies manage cases of abuse. That new entity has the potential to impact not only youngsters in the elite game but also set a precedent for professional and grassroots athletes across sports. However, Fifpro and the international NGO Human Rights Watch have already raised concerns about whether Fifa’s plans present a realistic alternative and meaningful improvement on the current system. So how can we feel confident that this proposed new entity is on the right track? Why it matters It is incredibly difficult to speak about being abused. It is even harder if speaking out might end a lifelong dream to become a top athlete. But if victims and survivors don’t report, sport rarely learns about the predators in its midst. That means we must do all we can to encourage and facilitate safe reporting. And that requires people to trust the entity. This will be not be an easy task: there are countless examples of abuse being covered up by federations, reports and concerns being ignored, perpetrators being tipped off or investigations being bungled – often because of personal connections or vested interests. In the existing system, you have to report into the same infrastructure that accredited, appointed and often promoted your abuser. For the new system to work, it must be completely transparent and indisputably independent. What to look out for The key here is the governance structure, and how that structure will guarantee rigorous investigation of everyone who participated in, facilitated or ignored abuse, regardless of their standing in the sporting community. We need to see clear and concrete examples of how the entity will be free to determine, without any actual or perceived interference from Fifa itself, when it does and does not investigate a complaint; how far it casts its investigatory net; and when it does and does not publish its findings. The new entity must also welcome external scrutiny to help it stay the course. This means engagement of civil society, and victim and survivor representatives, in the organisation’s key governance structures and decision-making functions. It also means ensuring that victims and survivors have appropriate legal support. Perpetrators and sports bodies will all be lawyered up. It is only fair that the victims and survivors, often children or young people and almost always lay people, should have the requisite professional representation. Only with these changes will victims and survivors believe that the entity is able and willing to make the pain of reliving their worst experience worthwhile. Why it matters Although sport is increasingly employing buzzwords such as “trauma-informed” or “survivor-centred” in its rhetoric, this rarely translates into action. Overwhelmingly, victims and survivors say that their reports of abuse were met not with a desire to offer protection, unearth the truth and root out the problem, but instead with a defensiveness that prioritises protecting sport’s reputation above all else. Many victims, survivors and whistleblowers also experience significant harm after engaging with the investigatory process. I have arranged multiple emergency evacuations (for example after armed gunmen shot at a whistleblower’s house) or secured urgent psychotherapeutic support for athletes who were suicidal after engaging with unsafe and unsympathetic sport bodies. What to look out for The key here is a demonstrable and detailed understanding of what this process entails for victims, survivors and whistleblowers. At every step of the way, we are looking for a recognition of the challenges that they may face and how these can become barriers to reporting or engaging in the process. This is a complex task but we should be seeing a number of commitments from the entity, including: to conduct risk assessments into the potential ramifications for victims, survivors and whistleblowers; to train staff, agents and partners in trauma-informed practices and on how to avoid prejudiced investigations; to obtain informed consent for participating in investigations from victims and survivors by clearly outlining what this entity realistically can and cannot achieve and offer; and to listen to concerns and avoid actions that can be perceived as favouring the person of concern or protecting the institutional reputation. For example, in the USA Gymnastics cases the prolific rapist Larry Nassar continued to be recommended as a doctor to athletes long after allegations had been made. The new entity must also honestly acknowledge and robustly tackle flaws in the current system. It will probably only be able to make recommendations to sport bodies. Those sport bodies, in turn, continue to operate under the very same flawed system that was not designed to handle abuse cases. The new entity must therefore either seek to create an overarching and bespoke framework for abuse cases, or demand change of individual federation rules. Why it matters This is a problem that will require extensive resources to tackle its causes and effects. If the new entity is under-resourced it will fail: victims and survivors will be encouraged to report into a structure that cannot respond promptly and effectively. It will become a black hole into which concerns disappear. Meanwhile, the sport bodies charged with keeping children safe will have successfully outsourced responsibility for any failings. What to look out for The key here is an unequivocal and transparent commitment to sustainable funding. If sport is serious about tackling this major problem, and it is serious about mitigating the significant risks to victims and survivors who report the problem, it must also acknowledge that this carries a serious price tag. The new entity must hire expert staff and build partnerships. As well as those already involved in these cases (such as player representatives and human rights NGOs) the entity needs to engage and pay survivor organisations and experts with lived experience. Many survivors work tirelessly to improve these systems on a shoestring or for free. This is deeply unfair: if sport is to benefit from their expertise it needs to ensure there is capacity to do the job well. So, what would all this cost? Wada, the independent anti-doping agency, costs $46m a year, to give you a ballpark figure. Sport can easily afford this. In 2018, Fifa generated more than $4.6bn in revenue, with 2019 reserves soaring to $2.7bn. In its own words, it is in a “healthy and sustainable financial position”. But if this new entity has the potential to benefit athletes across sport, then Fifa should not pick up the tab alone. If, and only if, the above criteria are met and the new entity gains full buy-in from victims and survivors, as well as those involved in holding sport to account for decades, then others must get on board. Fifa has been candid about its desire to work with the International Olympic Committee and governments to help foot the bill. This will make the entity more viable: the global sports industry is estimated to be worth approximately $620bn, with growth that is faster than global GDP. Just 0.01% of that global value would see the new entity well-resourced to fulfil this crucial task. As someone who has seen the devastation that abuse causes to children around the world, I can think of no better way to spend that money.",Sport/Football,Sexual abuse in football: what needs to be done now | Katherine Craig,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/06/sexual-abuse-in-football-what-needs-to-be-done-now
3/7/2022,"A flashmob of 200 classical musicians led by a renowned Russian-British pianist played a trio of Ukrainian compositions in Trafalgar Square on Sunday to protest against the Russian invasion. The pianist Petr Limonov directed the orchestra – which starred the violinist Jennifer Pike and the composer Gabriel Prokofiev on the French horn – in front of hundreds of spectators who had gathered around the makeshift stage at the foot of the National Gallery in central London. “There are so many people right now in Russia who don’t mind being jailed to protest against this war,” Limonov said. “I am getting all these messages from Russians saying, ‘Thank you for doing this,’ as I am someone who was born there who actually has some kind of a chance to put out a message now. “They truly have been silenced by a totalitarian machine. It is so powerful and so awful, their voices will be heard less and less and less. But this isn’t about Russians, it is to show support to Ukraine. So many of my friends are Ukrainians and have family still in Kyiv, and what they are going through now is hell. We stand with them.” “At this time we are trying to do all we can for a horrific situation, and musicians only really know one way, which is to play,” Pike said. “Today it is all about solidarity with Ukrainians and all people suffering at the moment. We are trying to show that our hearts are with them. And we play with all our hearts today.” Musicians from as far afield as Canada signed up to be part of Music for Peace, organised by the classical music fan Juliet Barclay, 63, in just five days. The group of volunteers crowdfunded to buy the rights to perform Hymn 2001 by the Ukrainian composer Valentin Silvestrov, who is believed to be in Kyiv as it remains under attack. They also performed the Ukrainian national anthem and Mykola Lysenko’s Prayer for Ukraine, which was originally a choral piece and was accompanied by singing by members of the crowd. The Ukrainian-British clarinetist Anastasia Gould, 16, was one of many amateur musicians who played in the orchestra alongside the professionals at the event. She said: “It is terrible what is happening to my people, to my country, and just to see everyone, not just eastern Europeans and Ukrainians, but everyone coming together, it is very heart-warming, it is very nice to see. “Most of my Mum’s side of the family were in [Ukraine]. Most of them have already fled to Poland. I’ve got some uncles who right now are training to go to war. Some are still staying in their home cities. “It is quite scary to watch from the sidelines when we’re here, we’re safe, we have our own warm houses, warm beds, and seeing these people that are scared for their lives.” Barclay came up with the idea for Music for Peace after feeling helpless about the mounting humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and on the surrounding borders. According to the latest UN figures, 1.5 million refugees have fled the country since the war started. “I started off contacting a niche group of friends, then putting word out to all the orchestras in London and the music schools to see if we could pull it off,” she said. “There was some unnerving silence for a while, and then all hell broke loose. Petr [Limonov] volunteered to conduct within an hour, and then Jennifer Pike came on board. Then we became utterly, utterly swamped. We could really only cope with organising 200 musicians, and we ended up turning down around 500 more.” Not a single rehearsal was held before the performance, which instead relied on “very detailed conducting notes” written on the music by Limonov. “[The musicians] have been beyond extraordinary,” Barclay said. “The passion for the cause they have shown and also towards each other. “We had people with disabilities, people with other barriers to taking part come down, helping each other in different ways. It’s been incredibly moving.”",Arts/Music,Flashmob orchestra in Trafalgar Square plays in solidarity with Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/flashmob-of-classical-musicians-in-trafalgar-square-play-ukrainian-national-anthem
3/7/2022,"A leading NHS surgeon has been censured by two medical regulators, and suspended by one of them, for repeatedly vandalising colleagues’ cars in their hospital car park, the Guardian can reveal. Andrew Baker has been given a formal warning by the General Medical Council (GMC) after being cautioned by police on six charges of causing criminal damage by dragging a key along the vehicles. The GMC told Baker, a maxillofacial surgeon at Leicester Royal Infirmary, that his behaviour risked undermining patients’ trust in both him as a medic and the medical profession as a whole. The warning was placed on his record last October and will run until the same month this year. However, the General Dental Council (GDC) – which also regulates Baker – has taken tougher action. It has banned him from practising as a dentist for a year and strongly criticised his integrity after he broke its rules by failing to tell it about being cautioned by Leicestershire police. Baker damaged his colleagues’ cars on six separate occasions between October 2020 and January 2021, vandalising one colleague’s car two separate times, before being arrested. The incidents were captured on CCTV. Under the terms of the caution, which he was given last March, he agreed not to park in the hospital car park for 20 weeks and not to commit any further offences for the same length of time, send a written apology to each colleague, pay for the repairs involved and attend a victim awareness course. Baker is highly respected in his field and performs specialised operations, including on patients with head and neck cancer. One of his colleagues said: “He’s a very good surgeon, and a surgeon who performs life-saving operations. “His behaviour was very odd and not normal behaviour for anyone. He made a mistake over that period in his life but he clearly shouldn’t have done it and he regrets it. He’s incredibly contrite.” Baker qualified as a doctor in 1990 and became an oral and maxillofacial surgeon in 1999. His vandalism of co-workers’ vehicles came to light recently when the GDC held a disciplinary hearing into his actions and decided to issue an interim suspension, which forbids him from working as a dentist until next February. Baker’s colleague added: “He’s has written letters to everyone involved to apologise and paid up [to repair the damage to colleagues’ cars]. He’s taken responsibility and wants to move on.” At the GDC tribunal the lawyer representing the regulator said that the surgeon’s “criminal offending was not an isolated momentary lapse of judgment but rather appears to be something more sustained. “[His] loss of control and resorting to violent or destructive behaviour [was] a real cause for concern.” Baker did not offer any defence, attend the hearing or get a solicitor to represent him. In its ruling, which it has published on its website, the GDC’s interim orders committee said the fact that Baker had damaged cars belonging to NHS staff in an NHS car park “is inherently serious in the committee’s judgment”. The regulator voiced disquiet that Baker had not told them about his caution, even though its rules require anyone on its register to tell it if they are convicted of a crime anywhere in the world. It only became aware of his behaviour when it learned last November about the GMC’s warning. It noted that he “had attempted to conceal from the GDC his previous criminality and investigation by the GMC. The material before the committee raises serious concern regarding Mr Baker’s probity,” it concluded. Baker did not reply when contacted by the Guardian to respond. Dr Andrew Furlong, the medical director of the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS trust, which runs Leicester Royal Infirmary, said the GDC’s actions did not affect Baker’s role with them. “All of our medical professionals, at all levels, are required to hold a GMC registration to work in our hospitals. Patient safety is our number one priority, so if a medic’s GMC licence is revoked, the individual would be unable to continue to work in our hospitals,” he said.",News/UK news,NHS surgeon censured for vandalising colleagues’ cars,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/06/nhs-surgeon-censured-for-vandalising-colleagues-cars
3/7/2022,"If there is good news for Manchester United on a bleak afternoon it is that their performance was good in parts. Admittedly those parts were few and far between and confined almost entirely to the first half, but that is still better than the derby at Old Trafford in November. The use of Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba as central attacking players, to the extent it caused Manchester City problems, worked, at least before half-time. But the problem is that none of that much matters if you’re going to defend like the visitors did. This was United doing what they have done since Ralf Rangnick took over, playing much better in one half than the other. But City won the half in which United played better 2-1, and the other 2-0 going on five. That they did not win far more convincingly was a result of the excellence of David de Gea and their own familiar shortcomings in front of goal. Perhaps this was a short-term fix from the short-term manager. Perhaps had Cristiano Ronaldo been available, or Marcus Rashford not been in such rotten form, the plan would have been more orthodox. But as it was there were pleasing interactions between the wide pairing of Anthony Elanga and Jadon Sancho and Pogba and Fernandes, none more so than in the counter that brought the equaliser. Perhaps if you squinted very hard, there was the semblance of something that could lead to a brighter future for United. Whether it’s worth squinting, though, is a different matter. Rangnick spoke last week of the need for continuity, but that is just what United do not have and will not have until it becomes clear of exactly what his consultancy role will consist. You can question the professionalism of players reluctant to learn a complicated new system for a man who may be gone in June, but not the logic. And there must also be a growing sense that it’s all futile with this defence. The opening goal was a case in point. There seemed little immediate danger when Bernardo Silva picked up the ball on the left, but he exchanged passes with Jack Grealish and suddenly, as the ball was cut back, Kevin De Bruyne was steaming unchallenged into the centre of the box, with inevitable consequences. Perhaps that’s a matter of coaching, perhaps of individuals losing focus or self-belief, but either way it is undermining everything else. Harry Maguire, it hardly needs saying, is not having a good time. A player who can look so commanding, particularly in the less demanding world of international football, has become a liability. It may not be fair, but when he is playing poorly, Maguire’s appearance counts against him because he looks so ungainly, wobbling into challenges with all the grace of an Easter Island figure being brought down from the quarry. There was a moment in the first half when he won the ball off De Bruyne because he mistimed his challenge so badly that the Belgian couldn’t process what had happened and ran into his prone legs. The second City goal came as the ball bounced loose from De Gea’s save and dribbled between Maguire’s legs as he tried to turn. It was misfortune rather than anything else, but it looked awful. And the worse these things look, the more criticism Maguire draws and the more forlorn he appears. Of course, it was his knee off which the third goal deflected; the way things are going for him, he’ll probably get swallowed by a whale or squashed by a falling piano on the way home. But the point is not to highlight that Maguire is out of form and fortune; it’s that he is perpetually left exposed by United, who have come to depend on him in a way that doesn’t seem particularly fair on anybody. It was rushing him back against Leicester, when he clearly wasn’t close to fully fit, that led to the 4-2 defeat that marked the beginning of the end of Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s reign. Raphaël Varane was absent with Covid, but he has somehow been transformed from the graceful figure of Real Madrid into a scarecrow of a defender, lurching about unconvincingly as bits of straw fall out of his sleeves. Victor Lindelöf has never been especially poised, but he too has been infected by the general clumsiness: he charged by Phil Foden as he lifted the ball over him in the build-up to the second goal with all the misplaced conviction of Wile E Coyote racing off a cliff. It doesn’t help that the holding midfielders offer only spasmodic protection or that the space behind the full-backs is so exploitable. Being a United centre-back must be an awful task at the moment. But as well as a failure of defensive organisation, there has been a failure of nerve and will. And without proper foundations, the future will never be built.",Sport/Football,Manchester United flounder without foundations to build upon | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/06/manchester-united-flounder-without-foundations-to-build-upon
3/7/2022,"Burberry has become the latest luxury brand to temporarily shut its stores in Russia following Moscow’s invasion of its neighbour Ukraine, after similar moves in recent days by Louis Vuitton, Hermès, Kering, Chanel and Prada. The British fashion brand has three stores in the country include one run by a franchisee and one in Moscow’s famous Red Square. It had already announced last week that it had halted deliveries to the outlets but confirmed this weekend that it was shutting them for the time being. Its decision to cease shipments to the country “due to operational challenges” had already effectively shut its online operations across the country. Burberry’s Russian site was still up and running as of Sunday evening, though international orders were likely to be disrupted further by Visa and Mastercard’s decision to pull out of the country, resulting in the majority of foreign transactions being blocked. Luxury labels have been exempt from the EU’s latest round of sanctions, meaning France and Italy can continue to export luxury goods to Russia without any legal repercussions. However, doing business and fulfilling orders in the region have become increasingly difficult amid restrictions on payments and transactions. On Friday LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, owner of brands including Christian Dior, Givenchy and Bulgari, said it was shuttering its 124 boutiques in Russia from Sunday, while Kering, which owns Gucci and Saint Laurent, confirmed it would close its two shops in the country. Chanel wrote on LinkedIn: “Given our increasing concerns about the current situation, the growing uncertainty and the complexity to operate, Chanel decided to temporarily pause its business in Russia.” On Saturday Prada confirmed it would follow suit, saying: “Our primary concern is for all colleagues and their families affected by the tragedy in Ukraine, and we will continue to support them.” Giorgio Armani addressed the war directly on the catwalk, with its fashion show in Milan last week held in silence in solidarity with Ukraine. However, the company has yet to confirm whether it has shut or suspended its operations within Russia in line with some of its rivals. The increasing operational and reputational risks of operating in the Russian market, plus the danger that sanctions could widen, have weighed heavily on stocks across the luxury sector. Burberry shares have fallen more than 20% since 23 February, the day before Russia officially invaded Ukraine. Its stock price has dropped from £20.63 to just £16.41 a share. Shares in LVMH have shed about 13% of their value over the same period, dropping from €6.65 (£5.50) to €5.77 (£4.77).",Lifestyle/Fashion,Burberry joins exodus of luxury brands from Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/06/burberry-joins-exodus-of-luxury-brands-from-russia
