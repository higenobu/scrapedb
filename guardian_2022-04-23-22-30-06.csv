4/23/2022,"Recurring throughout Lennart Hüper’s sombre documentary are images of the vast, deep ocean, whose rippling surface hums with an ominous melancholy. Against a gloomy soundscape of crashing waves and beeping boat signals, staggering facts flash up on the screen, stating the numbers of Libyan refugees who have died or gone missing at sea as they attempt to escape from their war-torn country and detention camps to Europe. Meanwhile, Lifeline, a civilian ship that carries out rescue missions for refugees, has been impounded on the coast of Malta for months, as its captain Claus-Peter Reisch endures fines and charges of commanding an improperly registered ship. Exposing how the arduous legal ordeal is a red herring in a political unwillingness to aid refugees, the film documents the inspiring resilience with which Reisch and his crew maintain the day-to-day operation of Lifeline while seeking legislative changes to allow government-sanctioned aid for refugees stranded at sea. At one point, Lifeline supporters hand out leaflets during the festive season to holiday shoppers; the matter-of-fact scenes of seasonal jollity feel especially heartbreaking when, right on their doorsteps, the same simple luxury is denied to displaced Libyan refugees. Much of No News revolves around the unsettling monotony of waiting. As the Lifeline crew patiently prepare their meals every day, the waste of resources underlines the cruelty of bureaucracy. The Libyan refugees are also waiting for something that might never come, a longing hemmed in by death, violence and uncertainty.  No News is available on 25 April on True Story.",Arts/Film,No News review – cruelty of waiting for refugee rescue ship stuck in Malta,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/19/no-news-review-bureaucracy-is-cruel-in-refugee-rescue-documentary
4/23/2022,"With its ingredients of just flour, water and salt, sourdough bread may seem to be one of life’s simpler and unambiguous pleasures. But it is now under scrutiny in a government review over the longstanding claims that a “sourfaux” scandal is undermining the traditional genuine loaf. The Real Bread Campaign, a project run by Sustain, the non-profit alliance for better food and farming, says supermarket chains and industrial bakeries are misleading customers, selling loaves labelled as “made with sourdough” for as little as £1.20. The factory-made loaves can contain as many as 15 ingredients, including palm oil and commercial yeast. Chris Young, coordinator of the Real Bread Campaign, said new bread labelling rules need to be imposed on supermarkets and leading bread companies to protect smaller-scale traditional bakeries. The campaigners have complained of a “sourfaux free-for-all”. He said: “We believe many people are being misled when they are buying their bread. Making sourdough is a slower process. We would want the definition to be ‘bread made without additives and using a live sourdough starter culture’.” The government has formed a bread and flour technical working group to review the regulations, and the Real Bread Campaign has submitted a raft of proposals for a radical overhaul of bread labelling. Ministers have confirmed that the working group is examining the use of the word sourdough – “to assess whether providing a definition of sourdough would be beneficial to consumers”. They are also being urged to crack down on supermarkets’ use of the phrase “freshly baked”. Supermarket bakeries have been accused of being “loaf tanning salons” in which part-baked and sometimes frozen bread is run through an oven again shortly before sale. Britain’s bread market is worth about £4bn a year and in recent years there has been an increase in the number of independent bakeries. Craft bakeries still account for just 5% of the bread market by value; large-scale bakeries account for about 75% and in-store bakeries 20%. Instead of commercial yeast, sourdough bread is made with naturally occurring yeasts in a fermented flour-and-water mix called the “starter”. It takes significantly longer to ferment and rise than bread with added yeast. Research has shown that sourdough bread is a much richer source of minerals, including magnesium, iron and zinc. While a genuine sourdough loaf in a traditional bakery typically costs at least £3.50, supermarkets are offering loaves labelled “with sourdough” at about a third of that price. Small bakeries say they are being undermined by what they consider is not really sourdough. Charlotte Nemeth, 24, co-owner with her husband, Dan, 40, of the award-winning Seasons Bakery, which operates in a former village school in Ingleton in the Yorkshire Dales, said: “We want to encourage people to buy sourdough because it is healthier for them, but they ask about the cost and why they can buy it for less than £2 in the supermarket. We need a legal definition that says sourdough bread is just made from flour, water and salt.” Dan Nemeth added that their bakery produces about 10,000 sourdough loaves a week, supplying local food distributors, a restaurant and two shops. The loaves retail at £3.85 each. He said a traditionally baked loaf and a factory-produced one were two “totally separate products”, adding: “It may be a cheaper option if you have a product containing additives, preservatives and yeast, but it is not genuine sourdough.” Supermarket shoppers can pick up a Sainsbury’s 800g white farmhouse loaf “with sourdough” for just £1.30. The bread contains just 3.5% sourdough, along with rapeseed oil, palm oil, soya flour and a flour treatment agent. A Tesco 800g finest white loaf “with sourdough” costs £1.20 and contains emulsifiers and added yeast. Campaigners do not believe the term sourdough should be permitted on such products. They support the sale of genuine sourdough loaves in supermarkets, but say products should be properly labelled. An investigation by the consumer watchdog Which? in 2018 found that just four out of 19 supermarket sourdough loaves tested could be regarded as authentic. The UK bakery industry proposed a code of practice in 2019 for the labelling of sourdough bread and rolls. It said where “space and skills were lacking” there were an increasing number of ingredients that could simplify the process. The proposals were rejected by the Real Bread Campaign as a “cheats’ charter”. The Real Bread Campaign’s submission to the government working group says: “When it comes to sourdough, leaving it to ‘the market’ to self-regulate clearly is not working.” The campaign proposes a new legal definition of bread, a legal definition of sourdough, a requirement to display ingredients for all bakery products, and legal definitions of “fresh”, “freshly baked” and “baked in store”. It says supermarkets and large retailers market products as freshly baked or baked in store that may have been manufactured, pre-baked and frozen off-site. The campaign says complaints about the marketing descriptions of bread to the Advertising Standards Authority and trading standards officers have been rejected on the grounds that without legal definitions they are unable to judge whether the terms are being used misleadingly. It says the government’s response to date to its proposals suggests it would prefer to see self-regulation and there is an “unwillingness to take the action necessary on this issue”. The government has promised to launch a consultation on potential amendments to the Bread and Flour Regulations 1998 in the summer. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Food information is robustly regulated in the UK and must not mislead consumers. This includes claims such as ‘fresh’ and ‘baked in store’. “There are continuing discussions on the use of ‘sourdough’ – and while regulation is an option, we encourage further work on the draft industry code of practice which could help achieve better understanding.” Retailers say they comply with all regulations in the sale and marketing of sourdough bread. Sainsbury’s said concerned customers buying loose bakery products should ask a member of staff for ingredient information, or check online.",Lifestyle/Food,Fake bake: UK government steps in over ‘sourfaux’ threat to craft bakers,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/23/fake-bake-uk-government-steps-in-over-sourfaux-threat-to-craft-bakers
4/23/2022,"Margaret Perry wants to buy a house one day. But the increases in her energy, water and council tax bills over the past few weeks have dented her ability to save. Then, on Easter Monday, her landlord called to say the monthly rent on her shared house was going up by £500. Instead of £675 a month, plus bills, for her room in Haringey, north London, her rent would rise to £825 – a 22% increase. “That’s just not an option,” said Perry, who earns about £30,000 a year and lives with two friends. “It’s hard enough as it is.” The 31-year-old screenwriter is one of a growing number of tenants being priced out by rising rents. Over the past month, online searches for “rent increase” and “landlord put rent up” reached an all-time high in the UK, according to Google trends data – and average private rents have surged nationally compared with pre-pandemic levels. “More people have had their rent increased over the past month or so than we’d normally see,” said Anny Cullum, policy officer at renters’ union Acorn. “That may be landlords worried about the cost of living and passing that on to their tenants. Food prices are going up, fuel’s going up, energy’s going up and people are really feeling the squeeze.” Government guidance says that for existing tenants, rent rises must be “fair and realistic”, in line with “average local rents” – but there is no cap on how much they can charge. Proposed changes can be challenged at a rent tribunal. But for many, like Perry, “the stress of that doesn’t feel worth it”. Between January 2019 and August 2021, just 341 rent tribunal cases were heard nationally, according to the campaign group Generation Rent. And even if tenants win, they can still be kicked out if the landlord serves a ‘section 21 notice’, initiating a no-fault eviction. Perry and her housemates tried to challenge the rent rise directly with the landlord, offering to pay £70 extra on top of their current monthly rent of £2,350: “We wrote a strongly worded email saying: ‘We’re not paying this.’ But he replied: ‘I’ll evict you’.” The three friends cannot afford the extra £500, so face being uprooted. “It’s exhausting and stressful. It feels like, as renters, we’re 100% disposable. You see somewhere as your home and you bed in, and then one phone call can take that away.” In 2020 and early 2021, demand for city centre properties – particularly in London – plummeted as pandemic restrictions bit. But now the cost of renting privately is climbing in the capital and nationally, with prices in every region above what they were pre-Covid, according to the property website Zoopla. In February, the average monthly rent was £984, up 8.8% versus March 2020 – with the steepest increase in the south west, which has seen a rise of 15%. Chestertons, a London letting agency serving some of the capital’s most sought-after areas, said the average monthly rent for its properties in 2022 so far was £2,864 – up 22% compared with 2019’s figure of £2,348 a month. For prospective tenants, it means extra competition for properties. “They can be very creative because obviously they want to stand out,” said Richard Davies, head of lettings. “We’ve seen examples where people put a presentation together or create their own mini webpage, with a profile of their pet and photographs of what food they like cooking. One couple talked about how they met.” In Manchester, another rental hotspot, graphic design student Chris Coppen has decided to stay put despite a “mad increase” in his rent. The 29-year-old, who lives with his partner and two housemates in Salford, works in retail and has just seen his pay increase by 6.8% – from £9.18 an hour to £9.80. But in March, he learned that the rent for the house where he has lived for three years will be rising by a third, increasing his share by £112.50 a month. “I nearly choked on my Cheerios,” he said. “I was like: ‘That can’t be legal, surely?’” The landlord has also demanded £519 in additional deposit. But they really don’t want to leave – and other properties in the area have also risen in price. “We’ve made a life here,” Coppen said. “So even with the mad increase, to uproot all that would be a lot of mental toil and financial strain that we don’t need while we’re studying. “If we moved out we’d have to pay the same to get less than we currently have. So we’ve just had to take it, really. I don’t know what we’re going to do, but we’ll make it work.” Julie Clark, 33, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, meanwhile, received an email recently saying the rent for the terrace house she moved into in June 2020 would be rising by £50 a month, from £600 to £650 – despite rotten floorboards and a broken boiler. She and her partner, who works in the public sector, successfully negotiated it down to £25. But for Clark, who claims universal credit, even that rise seems unmanageable on top of rising energy costs, food and clothes for her two young children. “We were already on the verge before any of this happened. All it takes is for anything else to go up and we’ll be really stuck,” she said. “There’s no safety or security.” Campaigners say greater protection is needed – including caps on rent increases in line with median wage rises, or a three-year freeze on increases for existing tenants. Campaign group Generation Rent is also calling for the closure of a loophole that allows landlords to demand six or 12 months’ rent upfront – something policy manager Sophie Delamothe said was becoming more common. “Previously it was happening with international students who might not have a guarantor, but it’s increasingly being used as a security measure,” she said. Previous attempts at reform have been thwarted. There are plans to ban no-fault evictions as part of the upcoming Renters’ Reform Bill, but in 2018, proposals to give tenants a three-year minimum contract – that would allow them to walk away but prevent them being kicked out at short notice – were abandoned by the government after a backlash from landlords. The National Residential Landlords Association, which has 90,000 members, said it opposes reforms such as rent controls, which it claims would “deter investment” in the sector. Meera Chindooroy, head of campaigns at the NRLA, said rent rises were fuelled by rising costs for landlords – including inflation, energy prices and costs for materials needed for repairs, as well as supply and demand pressures. Many landlords “won’t look to raise rents” at all because it is “in their interests to keep tenants in the property if they’ve got a good relationship with them”. That is not a luxury that has been afforded to Phillip Caudell, 30, an app developer from Bermondsey, south-east London. He found out last week that his rent is being put up by £650 a month – a 25% rise he and his partner, a teacher, cannot absorb. “We’re still in shock,” said Caudell, who has no choice but to leave the two-bedroom flat where he has lived for two years. He called for reforms to level the playing field for tenants. “At the moment it feels like landlords can say whatever price they want, and we have to pay it,” he said. “I can’t blame our landlord; at the end of the day, he’s just doing what landlords do. But it’s at the expense of people like us.”",Lifestyle/Money,Meet the tenants being forced from their homes by soaring rents in the UK,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/23/meet-the-tenants-being-forced-from-their-homes-by-soaring-rents-in-the-uk
4/23/2022,"A video has emerged from inside the besieged Azovstal steel factory in Mariupol showing women and children who say they are “running out of strength” and need to be urgently evacuated to Ukrainian-controlled territory. The film was recorded on Thursday. The women say 15 children are living in tunnels beneath the plant, ranging in ages from babies to teenagers. They are trapped together with their families and other civilians, including factory workers. The video shows several children, one apparently doing homework in a colouring book, surrounded by clothes and makeshift beds. A boy says he is desperate to see sunlight again and to breath fresh air outside after weeks living in a dungeon. «I want to go home, alive. I want to see the sun»Ukrainian soldiers have released video from the Azovstal bunkers, where children aged 5–14 have been sheltering for the past two months.#SaveMariupol pic.twitter.com/f8Qmwwmh1r An unnamed woman says she has spent 50 days underground, since 25 February, the second day of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Others say they took refuge in the plant in early March, as Russian forces pounded their apartments with artillery and airstrikes. Food and water are almost finished, the woman said, with people “on the edge of hunger”. “All the provisions we brought with us are running out. Soon we won’t even have enough food for the children.” She added: “We are here and need help. We are at the epicentre of events and we can’t get out. My child needs to be evacuated to a peaceful area and others too. We beg for guarantees of safety for our kids.” The woman continued: “We worry for the lives of our children and [elderly] parents who require medical care. They are running out of strength and life power. There isn’t a single day without shelling. They are scared even to go to the toilet.” The Ukrainian government has been trying to establish a humanitarian corridor which would allow civilians inside the plant to safely exit. The sprawling factory is a base for Ukraine’s Azov battalion, a part of the national guard, which shot the video. Under cover of darkness, Ukrainian forces managed to deliver weapons to the encircled soldiers via helicopter, Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of the national security and defence council said, adding: “We have a difficult situation, but our army is defending our state”. About 80 civilians escaped from Mariupol on Wednesday in four buses. Ukraine says subsequent attempts have failed because Russian troops keep shelling the meeting place. They add that Moscow has forcibly removed 40,000 residents to Russian territory. On Thursday, Putin declared victory in Mariupol. He said his forces, which control the rest of the city and have hoisted a flag on the TV tower, would not seek to enter the plant. They would instead seal it off so “not even a fly could escape”, he told his defence minister Sergei Shoigu. In reality, Moscow has resumed airstrikes and is trying to storm the steelworks, Ukraine’s presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said on Saturday. He told national TV: “The enemy is trying to strangle the final resistance of the defenders of Mariupol in the Azovstal area”. Russian units continue to hide evidence of their crimes by removing bodies from the city’s rubble, Ukrainian officials said. Satellite images show two new mass graves next to an existing cemetery in the village of Manhush, 15km west of Mariupol. Between 3,000 and 9,000 civilians are buried there, they suggest. Victims include civilians killed on 16 March when a Russian war plane flattened the city’s drama theatre. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zekenskiy, has said 300 people died in the strike. The theatre was being used as a shelter by about 1,500 woman and children. Since failing to capture Kyiv, the Kremlin has amended its war plan. The current goal is to “liberate” the eastern Donbas region. On Friday, a Russian general said a second objective was to create a land corridor linking the separatist so-called Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics with Crimea and the breakaway republic of Transnistria in Moldova. In its latest intelligence update, the UK Ministry of Defence said Russian tactical battalion groups which have massed in and around the Donbas had made “no major gains in the last 24 hours”. “Ukrainian counterattacks continue to hinder the efforts,” it said. Further north, the Ukrainian army clawed back some territory. It liberated three villages around the city of Kharkiv, according to regional governor Oleh Synehubov. Troops had secured positions in Bezruky, Slatine and Prudianka villages, he said. Ukraine’s general staff said it had repelled eight Russian attacks, destroying nine tanks, 18 armoured units and 13 vehicles, a tanker and three artillery systems. “Units of Russian occupiers are regrouping. The enemy continues to launch missile and bomb strikes on military and civilian infrastructure,” it said. Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai said on Saturday that two people were killed by Russian shelling in the city of Popasna. He said an evacuation train for residents of the Donetsk and Luhansk areas was expected from the eastern city of Pokrovsk bound for the western city of Chop, near Ukraine’s border with Slovakia and Hungary. “In addition to the fact that street fighting continues in the city for several weeks, the Russian army constantly fires at multi-storey residential buildings and private houses,” Haidai wrote on the messaging app Instagram. “Just yesterday, local residents withstood five enemy artillery attacks. Not all survived.” ",News/World news,Women and children beg for help in video from besieged Mariupol steel factory,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/women-and-children-beg-for-help-in-video-from-besieged-mariupol-steel-factory
4/23/2022,"My childhood was disturbed and frightening. I was four when we left London as the Second World War broke out. We lived in Barrow-in-Furness as the Barrow Blitz commenced: hiding under the stairs, windows were blown out and ceilings fell down. One night it was so bad we had to walk through the bombs to an air raid shelter. Claustrophobia plagued me into adulthood. I struggled to sit in the middle of rows and always stood by the door on the underground. At all times I needed an exit route. Nowadays, you’d see a therapist for help, but back then you just pushed through it. I fell into intelligence by chance. I worked as an archivist before getting married, then my husband was posted to India. I was a diplomat’s wife, holding coffee mornings and the like, when I was tapped on the shoulder and offered a job as a typist in the service. I was grateful for an end to the boredom. I listen to the radio in the middle of the night. It’s probably a function of old age that these days I don’t sleep soundly. I live alone with my two dogs – I think I’m comforted by feeling someone’s there with me. Being a public figure was uncomfortable at first. When I was told I’d become director general of MI5 – the first woman to do so – I was informed my name would be public. It was the prime minister’s decision, there was nothing I could do. When one newspaper published a photo of my house, we had to go into hiding; an IRA member was arrested with newspaper clippings about me. In my line of work you have to believe that for all its weaknesses, our democratic system is worth protecting. I’ll always regret not being with my mother when she died. I was away with work and failed to leave a contact address or number. She died in hospital having fallen down the stairs; but I didn’t know until later. We’d always been close. I’ll forever wish I’d been there in her final moments. Divorcing my husband seemed a faff. We separated back when our children were young, but the paperwork felt like an effort. Now, I’m rather glad we didn’t. We’ve become friendly again in old age, living together during lockdown. Yes, we argued, but we’ve mellowed. It’s a good recipe for marriage, I’d say: split up, live separately, and return to it later My children would probably say I was quite detached as a mum. I worked hard and was often away. We managed with au pairs, grannies and kind neighbours. Still, I always tried to be caring and encouraging, and now – with my five grandchildren – I’m far more present. I like getting older. People look after you. It’s a relief to no longer feel responsible for the world and all that’s happening. I hate this war, but I’m ancient, so I can do nothing. Being powerless brings a sense of lightness that’s rather pleasant.

4/23/2022,"Clad in a Scarface T-shirt, slick with sweat, Fontaines DC singer Grian Chatten slams his microphone stand down on the stage repeatedly, as though punishing the floor beneath him. The stage, however, is blameless. Formed in 2017 and named after a character from a mafia movie and their home city of Dublin, Fontaines DC have established their reputation as would-be guitar-music saviours, all the while questioning that burgeoning fame and the prevailing thumbnail sketch of their band as Irish post-punks with a poetic bent. The stage is probably their most natural habitat, where all the bristling ambivalence of their work translates into certainties: intense songs, delivered with commitment. As often as Joy Division have cropped up as a reference to Fontaines DC’s strain of low-slung ill ease, they’ve been matched by Chatten’s studies of frontmen such as Liam Gallagher and Ian Brown. At once cherubic and lairy, Chatten spends much of this small club show on the lip of the stage, balancing on monitors or perched on the metal barrier, stirring up the crowd, extending his wriggling fingers towards them, Sistine Chapel ceiling-style. The audience pays Fontaines DC back in outstretched limbs, umpteen crowd-surfers and word-for-word singalongs. This gig takes place a few days before the release of the band’s third album, Skinty Fia, providing an opportunity for fans to hear some new songs and get within two metres of an outfit whose snug club days are already over. FDC’s last London gig but one was at the 10,000-capacity Alexandra Palace; here, it’s 1,200. The band are not just an Anglo-Irish success story though. Their second album, A Hero’s Death (2020), was nominated for a Grammy in the US. An old song Fontaines DC play tonight at the climax of their set – Boys in the Better Land – chafes at the Irish habit of lionising new lives in new worlds. But now the band seem to be in with a chance of being those very boys, with recent slots on US TV shows segueing into a month-long North American live campaign. Skinty Fia completes a classic-sounding trio of albums; it tackles a number of thorny themes, not least the vexed job of being an Irish person abroad – the band all live in London now – and whether those deep roots nourish or bind. With their reputation as a live act already well established – bassist Conor Deegan attempting to dig his own hole in the stage with the head of his upside-down bass during Too Real is one of tonight’s more memorable vignettes – what’s telling is the crowd’s embrace of the new songs as old friends. No one folds their arms; there is no exodus to the bar. Jackie Down the Line, debuted in January, is a portrait of toxic masculinity that doubles as a tuneful banger. Perhaps in a nod to the song’s video, Chatten brandishes a bunch of red roses as he sings about someone who got away with murder. This murder ballad of sorts has more than a faint edge of any number of Pogues songs about abuse and disappointment. But Fontaines DC’s lyrics repay close listening. At some point near the end, “Jackie down the line” changes to “I’m one Jackeen of a line” – “jackeen” being a derogatory word for a Dubliner. Even better, perhaps, is I Love You, first aired during the band’s 2021 tour. Deegan’s juddering bassline heralds a strobe-lit love song in which Chatten delivers a rant aimed in part at his homeland – “the gall of Fine Gael and the fail of Fianna Fáil” – and in part at himself: “I had 30 ways of dying looking at me from the shelf,” he bawls. In all the praise for this band, not enough is made of Tom Coll’s relentless drumming, which keeps the chaos of the two guitars on a tight leash. Every Fontaines DC album thus far has come with assertions that the band are breaking new ground in an effort not to repeat themselves. In fact every record of theirs provides a thoroughly audible through-line, and Skinty Fia concludes a winning triptych by not messing with that formula overmuch. They remain that post-punk band, constantly gnawing away at their own identity, giving very good moshpit. Only one new track really breaks with the five-piece’s carousel of ire, tenderness and gloom: the title track, which introduces baggy dance beats and with it a taste of the Stone Roses. The rhythms work much better on record than they do in the flesh, where the detail is lost. Skinty Fia finds Chatten, meanwhile, swinging between his twin peaks. “I let her prize apart my ribcage like a crackhead at the blinds,” he sings in his guise as a gutter poet. And yet lines such as “But we can talk about it later/ You can read it in the paper” can’t help but bring to mind Oasis, especially when Chatten delivers his lyrics as a challenge.",Arts/Music,"Fontaines DC review – ire, tenderness and very good moshpit ",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/23/fontaines-dc-earth-london-live-review-skinty-fia
4/23/2022,"Turkish pop is going through an exciting and experimental phase. Where the nation’s most prized musical export was once rare 70s Turkish funk and psychedelic rock unearthed by crate-digging DJs such as Haai and Antal, recent releases from groups such as Şatellites and Altin Gün have fused these psych, synth-pop and Anatolian folk influences with earworming pop melodies to create a new hybrid genre. The latest artist to embrace this lively fusion is singer-songwriter Emir Taha. The 25-year-old came to prominence with his 2020, two-part debut EP Hoppa, before featuring on Turkish trap star BEGE’s hit single BSG the following year. Tapping into sultry, multilingual R&B by the likes of Omar Apollo and Rosalía, Taha’s output plays like a late-night confessional, pairing languid instrumentals with his whispered falsetto and a trace of stringed saz and oud melodies. The result blends traditional Turkish instrumentation with contemporary songwriting in a subtle, unforced way, reflecting Taha’s time clubbing and living in London and LA, as well as his childhood in Turkey. “I found a magic moment in the collision of both worlds,” he told NME. On forthcoming single Lades, based on the Turkish saying of doing something while knowing its outcome is futile, he explores the nuances of heartbreak over an infectiously minimal guitar melody. Hopefully, Taha will be mining the intersections of these musical worlds for many releases to come.

4/23/2022,"They generate billions for the South Korean economy and have helped turned the country into a cultural superpower, but must Jin, Jimin, V, RM, J-Hope, Suga and Jungkook – the seven members of the K-pop phenomenon BTS – start swapping their stage outfits for military uniforms? Less than three weeks before South Korea’s new president, Yoon Suk-yeol, takes office, the country is gripped by a debate over who, if anyone, should be exempt from compulsory national service – long seen as essential preparation for a potential conflict with its volatile neighbour, North Korea. While admiration for the band is widespread, South Koreans are divided over plans that will soon be debated in the national assembly to allow the performers, who are all in their 20s, to skip almost two years in uniform in recognition of their stellar contribution to the country’s international reputation. The award-winning group – who have sold more than 30m albums worldwide and picked up two Grammy nominations on their way to reaching the top of the US and UK charts – have been at the centre of speculation over an exemption since 2020, when they became the first K-pop band to reach No 1 on the US chart, with their song Dynamite. That year, Moon Jae-in, who will leave the presidential Blue House next month, thanked the singers for raising the profile of K-pop, while the national assembly passed a law allowing pop stars to defer their national service until they are 30, with the permission of the culture ministry. South Korea requires all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 to serve in the military for at least 18 months, to defend the country against threats from North Korea, which recently resumed test-launches of long-range ballistic missiles. Aware that many resent having to take two years away from their jobs, Yoon has vowed to increase their military salaries. Under the current law, only Olympic and Asian Games medallists and globally recognised award-winning classical musicians are exempt or allowed to perform alternative public service. They include Cho Seong-jin, the first Korean pianist to win the International Chopin Piano Competition, and Tottenham striker Son Heung-min. He did a three-week service after getting an exemption, along with his South Korea teammates, after they beat Japan to win gold at the 2018 Asian Games. But momentum is growing for a change that recognises the huge contribution made by the country’s pop stars. BTS alone are worth more than $3.54bn (£2.8bn) annually to the South Korean economy, according to a 2018 report by Hyundai Research Institute – equivalent to the contribution made by 26 medium-sized companies. The institute said the band was the reason 800,000 foreign tourists had visited the country the previous year. South Korea, which is technically still at war with North Korea, does not look kindly on celebrities who attempt to wriggle out of military service. Steve Yoo, an actor and singer also known as Yoo Seung-jun, was deported and banned from entering the country after he avoided conscription by becoming a naturalised US citizen in 2002, months before he was due to be drafted. While polls show most South Koreans support an alternative to compulsory military service for BTS, some voiced concern that, without clear guidelines, a change in the law could be exploited by less deserving celebrities. All male South Koreans “have a duty to fulfil their national defence obligations”, said Choi Hyung-seok, a 32-year-old office worker. “It is true BTS are promoting national prestige but the standards for evaluating national prestige are too vague,” he told the Observer. “If famous singers are exempted from military service, starting with BTS, there will probably be many cases of abuse. I think it’s important to have some flexibility so that male celebrities can do their work as well as serve the country.” Kim Jong-woo, a university student in the capital, admitted he felt “uncomfortable” supporting an exemption, but added: “It would make South Korea more powerful and attractive, and boost the country’s soft power, if people like Son Heung-min and BTS were able to continue their careers as musicians or athletes, rather than serving in an infantry unit or marching band for one-and-a-half years.” An exemption could alienate large numbers of young men – many of whom voted for the incoming president – at a time when they feel increasingly left behind by rising property prices and pressure on the job market. Under the existing law, BTS’s 29-year-old singer Jin – whose real name is Kim Seok-jin – will have to report for duty by the end of this year, while the other six members, born between 1993 and 1997, have a little more time to focus on their performing careers. BTS’s singers have previously indicated they will answer the call of duty when the time comes, but have not commented on the bill awaiting debate in the national assembly. Their agency, Hybe, has urged MPs to decide before Moon’s term ends on 10 May. Delaying a vote would result in “endless discussion”, the agency’s chief communication office, Lee Jin-hyeong, said recently. “The uncertainty is weighing on us. Hopefully, the matter can be concluded soon,” Lee said, according to the Korea Herald, adding that the artists were “finding it difficult to deal with the issue”.",Arts/Music,South Korea split in row over military service for BTS,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/23/south-korea-split-in-row-over-military-service-for-bts
4/23/2022,"Acouple came to see me a few months ago. What they wanted to ask me about wasn’t how to stay together – as a couples counsellor, coach and writer, this is what clients usually come to see me about – but how to separate. However what this couple wanted was slightly different. They were in their mid-50s and they told me they had been married for more than 30 years. They loved each other. They’d had a marriage that had survived the ups and downs of most unions. They had three children all of whom had left home. Yet they were looking at a future together with apprehension. They didn’t want to divorce, they just wanted to work out how to stay together while also being apart. The wife was a homebody and also loved being near her children. The husband had rediscovered an adventurous side in himself that had lain dormant for a couple of decades. What they were proposing was a marriage gap year. “I’m a doctor,” the husband told me. “I just want to experience something different.” His intention was to go and spend a year working as a volunteer in Malawi. “We are getting older,” the husband said. His fear was that he’d never get to do what he really wanted – to work in Africa – unless he did it now. His wife, understandably, was nervous about it. “I don’t want to go to Africa,” she said. However she also did understand how important it felt to her husband. “I love him so I don’t want to stop him from having this year out,” she said. This idea of a marriage gap year is something I have come across before. The sister of a very good friend took a break from her marriage. She and her husband had met when they were in their late teens and once the children had left home, they found they wanted to lead different lives. For her, it was about having some excitement, something new before she and her husband settled down to a life post-children. “I went and travelled the world for two years,” she said. “My husband stayed at home and gardened.” But, in reality, how does this work? A lot of couples would find this very difficult. It’s not easy to explain to your long-term partner that you want to take a break. However, for some people, the world appears as an enticing and exciting place and, if they have been married for a long time and been a parent on top of that, the idea of getting out there, kicking off their shoes and having some new experiences is very hard to resist. As a counsellor I find this fascinating. I explain that it’s not a “bad” idea but it involves many compromises and trust. My gap-year couple agreed that sex with other people was off the agenda. “It’s not about sex anyway,” the husband said. “I just want to go and live a different life for a year or so. I want different experiences and I can see life getting away from me, and I find that difficult.” Of course his wife also found this difficult – she felt threatened and nervous but she did understand how important it was for her husband to do this. But for some people it is also about having different sexual experiences. And many would suggest that this desire for a marriage gap year really is all about that and the “I want to have new experiences” is a smokescreen for saying “I want to have sex with other people”. My friend’s sister and her husband agreed they would be free to date and have intimate relationships with other people. “I had only really slept with my husband,” the sister told me. “I didn’t want to get older and to never have had physical experiences with other men. It seemed like a waste of my life as if there was this whole other exciting world out there that I was never going to experience.” For her, this was part of the deal and she had been very clear with her husband about it. “He wasn’t that happy about it,” she said, “but he did understand.” She had a fabulous two years travelling the world and taking lovers, then came home and the marriage continued. “It’s better than ever now,” she said. “I feel settled. I’ve done my thing and now I am home and I’m happy to be here.” Her husband hadn’t been sure she would return. He is thankful that the marriage survived, she said, but it came at a cost for him. Younger couples are far more au fait with this sort of thing – polyamory and “ethical non-monogamy” appear to be growing in popularity – but it’s a whole new game for my generation of forty- to fiftysomethings. Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith may have talked about having an open relationship and giving “each other trust and freedom”, but they are a generational rarity and even Smith has been quick to say this does not amount to infidelity. We were brought up to believe in The One. And, of course, it’s about more than that – fidelity, loving, surviving the ups and downs, commitment, honesty, being there for each other – a kind of stoicism. Young people don’t see it like this. They can have very strong prime relationships that are open and communicative and connected while also having relationships with other people. They have a completely different working model. For older couples, it is not easy. However, post kids leaving home, many marrieds are wondering “is that all there is?” They don’t necessarily want to be polyamorous but neither do they want to be doing the same thing for ever after, so they go and have new experiences separately then come back together. It’s risky but also interesting. I do work with couples on the idea that giving each other space to live their lives separately doesn’t mean the relationship is failing. Now Covid is “over” and we are all going out more, some are wondering what happens when you need a break from the relationship in order to do something for yourself? I do have a few coming in to talk about polyamory and open relationships but many struggle with this. How do we get to experiment a bit when polyamory feels like something young people do? For most it’s about having new experiences – travelling the world, relocating for a while, working at a different job, volunteering. Just changing their life up a bit for a defined period of time – exactly like a student gap year but at a more mature age. The marriage or relationship can even be enhanced as the couple involve each other in hearing about these new adventures – bonding them more securely. My original couple ended up being excited at the prospect of the gap year. “I can’t wait to wake up in the African sun,” the man said, “and then I’ll come home to suburbia and begin again.” www.lucycavendishcounselling.com",Lifestyle/Life and style,Nifty ways to leave a lover (temporarily) – how a gap year could save your marriage ,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/23/nifty-ways-to-leave-a-lover-temporarily-how-a-gap-year-could-save-your-marriage
4/23/2022,"Arise in Asian American gun ownership. Blocks-long lines for pepper spray in Manhattan Chinatown. Children kept home from school by fearful parents. Elderly people who have stopped leaving their homes. A warning to Filipinos in the US, issued by the Philippine embassy in DC. Across the US, Asian American communities have been gripped by anger and despair as hate crimes against them have increased sharply – rising by 339% last year compared with 2020, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. As early as March 2020, the FBI issued a report predicting a “surge” in hate crimes against Asian Americans, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which happened to originate in an Asian country. Adding fuel to the fire: incendiary and racist language – used by irresponsible politicians and repeated across social media – and geopolitical tensions with China. “All of those are conditions that have led at other times to terrible anti-Asian violence,” says author and activist Helen Zia. But what’s different this time, says Zia, is that more people recognize the problem. In the 1980s, Zia helped bring about the first federal civil rights case involving an Asian American: Vincent Chin, a Chinese American man was beaten to death by two white auto-workers who took him for Japanese and blamed Japan for the car industry’s struggles. They were merely fined $3,000 each for the killing. Today Asian Americans, the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group in the US, are finally in a position to do more than stock up on pepper spray and hope for the best. Meanwhile, academic research on implicit and unconscious bias, improvements in data collection, and social movements like Black Lives Matter have contributed to greater understanding about racism and bias, and the ways that can translate into hate speech and violence. From the local through federal level, community advocates and other leaders have been organizing, debating, and building support, aimed at combating the ongoing epidemic of anti-Asian hate. After the Atlanta-area shooting deaths of eight people, six of them Asian women, by a white gunman in March 2021, President Joe Biden announced a set of actions to respond to anti-Asian violence and xenophobia, and in May, further established the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, “to advance equity, justice, and opportunity for AA and NHPI communities”. Among other actions, the initiative will improve data collection methods that have left Asian people underrepresented in government statistics, and by extension, the resulting programs and policies. Long-term, many agree that the answer lies in education. In January, Illinois became the first state to require that Asian American history be taught in public schools. New Jersey soon followed, and at least nine other states are considering the same. “Members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community have made countless contributions to our state and country, yet they are made virtually invisible by our history books,” said four NJ assembly sponsors of the bill in a joint statement. “This erasure … not only prevents students from gaining a full understanding of our nation’s history, but also opens the door for racial biases that can turn into violence and hatred.” Kani Ilangovan, a parent and psychiatrist of Make Us Visible NJ, which spearheaded the movement, said she was haunted by events like the 2017 shooting death of Srinivas Kuchibhotla, an engineer from India, at a Kansas restaurant, by a white man who called Kuchibhotla and the friend he was with “terrorists” and “Iranians”, and asked whether they were in the country illegally. In 2020, as anti-Asian violence swelled anew, Ilangovan took comfort in learning about AAPI history and racial justice movements through a book club formed partly in response to the murder of George Floyd. “It gave me a deeper sense of identity and belonging, and helped me learn a lot of history that I was not aware of,” she said. She realized that even in her children’s predominantly Asian school – let alone the predominantly white school she had attended growing up – Asian Americans were not reflected in the curriculum, contributing to their image as “forever foreigners” – not part of the American story, and therefore, not deserving of the same treatment as other Americans. She reached out to members of her book club, and formed Make Us Visible NJ. They were further galvanized when Stop AAPI Hate issued a 2021 report stating that one in three AAPI parents said their child had experienced a hate incident in the past school year. More than 1,500 signatures, 60 partner organizations, and several rallies later, they helped pass the historic legislation. Another, less widely embraced response to anti-Asian hate has been the 2021 passing of the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act. It builds on the 1990 Hate Crimes Statistics Act, which required data collection “about crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity” and prompted the FBI to begin publishing its annual report on hate crime statistics. The 1990 act “was a positive development, but the statistics that came out showed that law enforcement agencies weren’t really reporting incidents of violence against Asians,” said Stanley Mark, a senior staff attorney with the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund. Even after 9/11, he said, many of the resulting attacks against Sikh, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Muslim Americans were not classified as hate crimes. (As it was, recorded anti-Muslim hate crimes increased 1,600%.) The new hate crimes act aims to fill some of those gaps by making it easier to report incidents and incentivizing local police forces to improve their data collection methods, for example through better training around how to identify hate crimes. (It also includes provisions named after Heather Heyer, the woman run over and killed by a neo-Nazi in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.) “You’re not going to find anti-Asian bias if you’re not looking for it, so this bill does help train police to look for it better,” said Mark. However, critics say it does not address the root causes of hate, and fear the statistics will merely result in over-policing of Asian and other ethnic minority communities. “The community is divided about the role of police,” says Jo-Ann Yoo, executive director of the Asian American Federation, an umbrella organization for non-profits in NYC. In New York City, for example, people reluctant to interact with police can instead report incidents to the Commission on Human Rights, which collects data about (and sometimes acts on) bias, harassment and discrimination incidents in general – a wider array than hate crimes, which are narrowly defined. “Dedicate resources to local communities,” wrote Stop AAPI Hate in a response to the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act. Existing grassroots efforts that have sprung up during the pandemic offer a glimpse at what locals feel is needed: new community groups, focusing on everything from mutual aid, to activism, to organizing volunteers to patrol the streets, to stoking pride in Asian American culture, have proliferated. But the depth of the need is daunting. In New York, the most pressing issues Yoo has seen include food insecurity, financial struggle and lack of healthcare access among the many Asian workers whose industries were disproportionately affected by the pandemic (eg nail salons, restaurants, and other service-based industries). Elderly people are afraid to leave their homes and isolated by language and technological barriers to accessing social service programs. Domestic violence has increased. Yoo also says there is widespread fear and burnout among non-profit workers themselves, who have spent the past two-plus years on the frontlines: feeding people, organizing grief circles, going door-to-door setting up Zoom for elderly people, meeting with victims of violent attacks, and struggling “to figure out what we are going to do”. Moreover, they, and many other Asian Americans, continue their work while feeling unsafe themselves. “I get a lot of emails saying, my boss is asking us to come back to work but I’m afraid to ride the subway,” Yoo said. “I’m calling on corporations to come up with a plan to protect their staff, because the fear is very real.” Yoo sees an enormous need for mental health services – for victims of racially motivated violence, bystanders who witness such crimes, the communities traumatized by fear, and perpetrators themselves. “Many of the assailants were homeless with severe mental illness. Where’s the help for them?” she says. (New York City’s unhoused population is at its highest level since the Great Depression, and the city, under the new Eric Adams administration, has been forcibly removing unhoused people from the city’s subways and tearing down homeless encampments.) “This country is going through this major crisis on a global level, and it provides a breeding ground for racism, for hatred, and oppression of all sorts,” says Dr DJ Ida, executive director of the National Asian American Pacific Islander Mental Health Association. “When people are stressed, the ugliness rears its head.” What makes hate crimes insidious for victims, she explains, is that, while a random mugging or attack can be deeply traumatizing, there remains “a sense of, ‘I was in the wrong place at the wrong time’”. With hate crimes, by contrast, there is no escaping the situation, “because it’s escaping who we are. The psychological implications of that can be very profound.” Ida said that for those working in mental health, the Biden administration’s proposed 2023 budget has been a source of hope. It allocates an unprecedented billions upon billions to expand access to mental health services – for example, $1bn to double the number of school counselors and other school health professionals over the next 10 years. Ultimately, many agree that whatever the federal, policy and big-picture solutions, combating hate boils down to individuals taking action. “Legislation helps, but you can’t legislate away hate. You have to deal with it on a local, day-to-day level,” said Stanley Mark, the AALDEF lawyer.",News/Society,‘The fear is very real’: how Asian Americans are fighting rising hate crime,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/23/asian-american-fighting-rising-hate-crime
