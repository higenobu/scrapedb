5/15/2022,"A North Carolina mother said she was evicted because her daughter was twerking by the pool. The Charlotte Observer reported that Marshette Foster received an eviction notice from Element SouthPark earlier this month. The report said that Foster hired a lawyer and is contesting the eviction. A North Carolina woman and her 21-year-old daughter were evicted from their apartment after complaints of dancing at the complex's outside pool. Marshette Foster, who resided at Element SouthPark in Charlotte, paying $2,600 a month for two bedrooms, said the apartment concierge confronted her daughter on April 30 following reports of twerking on the pool deck, The Charlotte Observer reported earlier this month. In a statement to The Charlotte Observer on May 9, Element SouthPark said they were evicted due to ""extremely unacceptable behaviors"" from Foster's daughter and her friends, alleging that the group was captured on video ""performing acts of public nudity, fighting, and other extremely unacceptable behaviors."" They added that children were in the vicinity when it occurred. ""We are proud to be a diverse community with residents and team members from all backgrounds,"" the statement obtained by The Observer said. According to the report, Foster said that her daughter —identified as Alanah — apologized to the staff, telling them that she would stop doing it. Additionally, Foster told the outlet that the concierge said that Alanah had too many guests by the pool, emphasizing that they did not have the same complaint about white residents who were also there and their group of guests. This resulted in Alanah's friend cursing at the concierge, she added. ""This is very troublesome to me. ""I really believe this residence... they do not spread the rules fairly. "" Foster told The Raleigh News and Observer. ""You are discriminated here."" However, Foster denied the claims made by the apartment complex: ""They're making us out to be unkempt, uncouth, that we don't follow the rules,"" she said, according to the outlet. The Charlotte Observer reported that after Foster received her eviction notice, she hired a lawyer who told her to remain in her apartment following the complex's deadline to contest it.
