3/19/2022,"The lawyer representing the mother of Hunter Biden’s three-year-old daughter said the president’s son will likely be indicted in a tax fraud investigation, in comments to CNBC on Thursday. “I expect him to be indicted,” attorney Clint Lancaster said. “Just based on what I saw in his financial records, I would be surprised if he’s not indicted.” Lancaster represents Lunden Alexis Roberts, a former stripper with whom Hunter Biden fathered a child. Roberts first sued Hunter Biden in 2019, claiming she had his daughter, and the suit was settled in January 2020 with Hunter agreeing to pay child support. Roberts testified a year ago as part of a probe into Hunter’s finances, Lancaster confirmed, adding that he gave investigators “a significant amount of Hunter’s financial records.” While Lancaster did not detail all the records he turned over, he noted that “I had his Burisma pay records. I had records of ultimately what Burisma paid into the United States.” Hunter Biden worked for Ukrainian energy company Burisma while his father was vice president. President Biden’s son has been under federal investigation since 2018 for potential criminal tax violations, and possible violation of money laundering and foreign lobbying rules, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. Hunter wrote in a 2014 email that Burisma officials “need to know in no uncertain terms that we will not and cannot intervene directly with domestic policymakers, and that we need to abide by FARA and any other U.S. laws in the strictest sense across the board.” Emails reviewed by the Times came from a cache first reported by the New York Post in 2020, which said the files were retrieved from Hunter Biden’s laptop. While it is unclear where the investigation into Hunter Biden will lead, Lancaster claimed that he and Roberts do not want Hunter to go to jail. “It’s not my goal, much to the unhappiness of many people in the Republican Party,” Lancaster told CNBC. Lancaster also said Hunter Biden has never seen or asked to see his daughter. “It’s sad, because the baby looks like him, with blond hair,” Lancaster said.

3/19/2022,"On Wednesday. the White House announced a new $800 million military support package for Ukraine in a bid to help that country fight back against the ongoing Russian invasion. Part of the aid package is for cutting-edge aerial drones that experts say could prove exceedingly lethal to Russian forces. The list of weapons to be shipped, President Biden said, includes 9,000 anti-armor systems, 7,000 small arms and 100 tactical unmanned aerial systems. A U.S. official later confirmed to ABC that the aerial systems to be sent would be small Switchblade drones. Manufactured by the California company AeroVironment, the drones come in two variations: the Switchblade 600 and the 300. The latter is built to hit at smaller and more precise targets; the 600 is built to strike armored vehicles and tanks. The 300 is less than 2 feet long, weighs 5.5 pounds and can fly up to 15 minutes. The larger drone weighs 50 pounds and can fly for 40 minutes over a range of 25 miles. Both can be carried in a backpack and deployed by individual soldiers. It has not been confirmed whether both models will be included in the shipment. According to its manufacturer, the drones can cruise at around 65 mph and come fitted with cameras and GPS systems. They are single-use, which means they explode after striking their target and are not recoverable after they have been launched. The Switchblades also have a “wave-off” feature so that operators can abort a mission if civilians appear near the target or if the enemy withdraws. “These were designed for U.S. Special Operations Command and are exactly the type of weapons systems that can have an immediate impact on the battlefield,” Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense, told ABC News. Ukraine’s drones have proved vital in carrying out successful attacks in the early stages of the invasion. Jack Watling of the London-based Royal United Services Institute told Euronews that Ukraine had used drones to strike Russian forces before they were able to set up their air defenses in the battlefield. Watling went on to say that the Ukrainian army drones “have been essentially flying in at a low level and then coming up and raiding with them. So striking targets of opportunity.” A senior defense official confirmed the Switchblades’ effectiveness for Ukrainian forces by claiming that the drones would be useful in taking out long-range Russian artillery as Russia ramps up the bombardment of major cities in Ukraine. ""These tactical UAVs can be useful against Russian vehicles and artillery,"" the official told reporters this week. On Friday, the Times of London reported that an elite Ukrainian drone unit had destroyed dozens of “priority targets” by attacking static Russian forces as they slept. That specialist unit within the army, named Aerorozvidka, has reportedly been striking vehicles, including tanks and trucks, since the invasion began on Feb. 24. “We strike at night, when Russians sleep,” Yaroslav Honchar, the unit’s commander, said from his base in Kyiv. The latest allocation of military aid came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on the West to “do more” in the fight against Moscow's aggression when he addressed Congress on Wednesday. In his speech, Zelensky invoked the horror of the 9/11 terror attacks as he pleaded for more military aid.",World/Yahoo News,Inside the cutting-edge Switchblade drones the U.S. is shipping to Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/inside-the-cutting-edge-switchblade-drones-the-us-is-shipping-to-ukraine-164754374.html
3/19/2022,"By Jan Lopatka BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovakia's defense minister said on Thursday that his country was willing to provide Ukraine with S-300 air defenses if NATO allies find a substitute, but his visiting U.S. counterpart told reporters he had nothing to announce on that. Ukraine has appealed to Western nations for air defenses to help repel a Russian military onslaught, now in its fourth week. ""We have been in discussion with U.S., Ukraine and also other allies on the possibility to deploy, send or give the S-300 to Ukrainians and we are willing to do so,"" Slovakia's Defence Minister Jaroslav Nad told a news conference. ""But willing to do so immediately when we have a proper replacement."" U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who was speaking alongside Nad, declined to say whether the United States might be willing to fill the gap. ""I don't have any announcements for you this afternoon. These are things that we will continue to work with all of our allies on. And certainly this is not just a U.S. issue, it's a NATO issue,"" Austin said, without elaborating. U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced an additional $800 million in security assistance, including weapons to take down Russian planes and tanks. But the kinds of air defenses deployed in Slovakia are highly sought after by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. NATO member Slovakia has one battery of the S-300 air defence system, inherited from the Soviet era after the break-up of Czechoslovakia in 1993. It expects to get Patriot missile defenses as part of a new NATO battle group that has just been agreed to be deployed in the country as part of NATO's reinforcements on the alliance's eastern flank. But the Slovaks don't see that as sufficient, given it will not be their system and it is not clear how long it will be based in the country. Slovakia shares a 98-kilometer (61-mile) border with Ukraine. The country also operates a small fleet of MiG-29 fighter jets, also dependent on Russian servicing. ""We were discussing various options for how to fill in this gap if we decided not to use MiG-29s anymore,"" Nad said, adding that Slovakia was expected to get Lockheed Martin's F-16 fighter jets in 2024.

3/19/2022,"(Reuters) - A former Russian deputy prime minister who spoke out against the Kremlin's actions in Ukraine has quit as chair of a prestigious foundation after a lawmaker accused him of a ""national betrayal"" and demanded his dismissal. Arkady Dvorkovich, deputy prime minister from 2012 to 2018, became one of Russia's most senior establishment figures to question the war when he told U.S. media this week that his thoughts were with Ukrainian civilians. His comments prompted a senior ruling party lawmaker to demand that he be fired and to accuse him of being part of a ""fifth column"" undermining Russia. The 49-year-old had been chairman since 2018 of the Skolkovo Foundation, an innovation and technology hub on the outskirts of Moscow that brands itself as a kind of Russian Silicon Valley. On Friday, the Skolkovo Foundation said in a statement that Dvorkovich had decided to step down. He could not be reached immediately for comment. He remains president of the International Chess Federation (FIDE). Igor Shuvalov, chairman of the foundation's board of directors, said Dvorkovich had resigned, saying that he could no longer combine his duties at Skolkovo with his responsibilities at FIDE under the current circumstances. Thousands of people have been detained for protesting against Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which officials in Moscow describe as a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""de-nazify"" its former Soviet neighbour. President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday delivered a stark warning to people he called ""traitors"" in Russia who he said the West wanted to use as a fifth column to destroy the country. After his comments to Western media, Dvorkovich said in a statement on Skolkovo's website that he was ""sincerely proud of the courage of our (Russian) soldiers"" and that Russia had been targeted by ""harsh and senseless sanctions"". But the following day, Andrei Turchak, a lawmaker from the ruling United Russia party, called for his sacking. ""He has made his choice,"" Turchak said. ""This is nothing but the very national betrayal, the behaviour of the fifth column, which the president spoke about today.""

3/19/2022,"Marie Yovanovitch wrote that she lost her appetite while watching Trump's 2018 presser with Putin. It was ""a spectacle that left observers pondering the depths to which Trump had sunk,"" she wrote. ""God only knows what Trump said"" to Putin in private, the former Ukraine ambassador wrote. The US's former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, writes in her new book that she lost her appetite and couldn't finish her french fries while watching then President Donald Trump's joint press conference with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in 2018. Yovanovitch was serving as the US's ambassador to Ukraine when Trump and Putin held a bilateral summit in Helsinki in 2018. At the time, she writes in her memoir, ""Lessons From the Edge,"" the US Navy was conducting maritime exercises with Ukraine in a show of solidarity against Russia's aggression. ""It was quite a show, and as I watched the display of US sea power and leadership ... I was proud to be an American,"" the book says. But the same day, Trump held ""what turned out to be a disastrous meeting with President Putin in Helsinki,"" she continues. ""The summit wrapped up with a joint press conference between the two leaders, a spectacle that left observers pondering the depths to which Trump had sunk in his pandering to Putin."" ""I watched the infamous Trump-Putin press conference at my Odesa hotel that evening while pecking at room-service french fries,"" the book says. ""I quickly lost my appetite as I saw our president toady up to Putin and take the Russian's word over that of our own intelligence agencies, which assessed that Russia had interfered in the 2016 US presidential election."" Trump's presser with Putin shocked US allies and provoked severe backlash from national security and foreign policy experts, and even some of Trump's own supporters. Among other things, he said he didn't ""see any reason"" why Russia would have meddled in the 2016 election. When asked whether he believed the US intelligence community or Putin, Trump said Putin was ""extremely strong and powerful in his denial."" Trump also recycled nonsense conspiracy theories about the FBI and the Democratic National Committee, and refused to say he supported the findings of US officials over the Russian leader's claims. And those statements were ""what was said publicly,"" Yovanovitch writes in her memoir. ""God only knows what Trump said in the two-hour one-on-one meeting with Putin, a meeting unusual not only for its length but because Trump did not brief US officials on the discussion later. That raised all sorts of questions."" After being roundly criticized for his handling of the press conference, Trump read from a written statement, saying that he misspoke when he said he didn't see why Russia would have interfered in the 2016 election. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said he had ""full faith"" in US intelligence agencies and wanted to clarify his statements from the bilateral summit. Yovanovitch, meanwhile, made headlines as one of the key witnesses in Trump's first impeachment inquiry, which centered on his efforts to strong-arm the Ukrainian government into publicly announcing investigations into the Biden family ahead of the 2020 US election. More than a dozen witnesses, including Yovanovitch, testified about Trump's pressure campaign, which included withholding nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine and dangling a White House meeting for Ukraine's president while demanding the investigations. Yovanovitch's testimony focused on her work as ambassador to Ukraine and how corrupt forces — both in the US and Ukraine — led to her unceremonious ouster and abrupt recall back to the US before the end of her term. She also described how ""shocked and devastated"" she felt when she learned the details of a July 2019 call between Trump and Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which Trump pressured Zelenskyy to investigate the Bidens, called Yovanovitch ""bad news,"" and said that she was ""going to go through some things."" While she testified, Trump lobbed attacks against Yovanovitch on Twitter in a move legal experts said amounted to witness intimidation. Yovanovitch, when asked to respond to the attacks mid-testimony, said they were ""very intimidating."" Insider has reached out to Trump's office for comment.
