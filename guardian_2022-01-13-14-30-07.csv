1/13/2022,"Increasingly repressive and violent acts against civilian protests by autocratic leaders and military regimes around the world are signs of their desperation and weakening grip on power, Human Rights Watch says in its annual assessment of human rights across the globe. In its world report 2022, the human rights organisation said autocratic leaders faced a significant backlash in 2021, with millions of people risking their lives to take to the streets to challenge regimes’ authority and demand democracy.  Human Rights Watch also said the emergence of opposition parties willing to put aside their political differences and form alliances to attempt to remove corrupt or repressive governments or leaders was another sign of a trend towards weakening autocratic rule. As examples of “unlikely” opposition coalitions, HRW pointed to the Czech Republic, where the prime minister, Andrej Babiš, was defeated, and Israel, where the premiership of Benjamin Netanyahu was brought to an end after 12 years in power in 2021. Broad alliances of opposition parties have also been formed to challenge Viktor Orbán in Hungary and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey in future elections. In an essay introducing Human Rights Watch’s report, which analyses the situation in countries across the world, its director, Kenneth Roth, also argues that growing repression and “overt electoral charades” in countries such as Russia and Nicaragua should be seen as a sign of weakness, not strength. “There is a narrative that autocrats are prevailing and democracy is on the decline, yet if you look at the trends in human rights over the last 12 months it doesn’t look so rosy for the autocrats,” said Roth. “There has been an outpouring of public support for democracy with people taking to the streets in China, Uganda, Poland, Myanmar, often risking their lives to do so, and many other places where repressive regimes are struggling to maintain their control. “While the increasingly violent and regressive actions of repressive regimes across the world may look like them flexing their muscles, we increasingly see these as acts of desperation,” he said. While 2021 saw the seizure of power by armed groups in Myanmar and Afghanistan, Roth said there had been a failure to normalise their rule or subdue civilian populations. “While we see bloodshed on the streets, we also see millions refusing to accept the denial of their human rights and a failure of autocratic rulers to distract populations with policies attacking LGBTQ communities, abortion or women’s rights.” However, he said that democracy would fail to thrive without stronger leadership by democratic governments, which focused on short-term political gains during 2021 and failed to address the most urgent issues of the climate emergency, inequality, racial injustice and poverty. Human Rights Watch said that despite their alarming record on rights abuses, the US continued to provide arms to countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also pointed to continued moves by the EU to pursue investment deals with China, despite Beijing’s alleged use of ethnic Uyghurs as forced labour. “Promoting democracy means standing up for democratic institutions such as independent courts, free media, robust parliaments and vibrant civil societies even when that brings unwelcome scrutiny or challenges to executive policies,” Roth said.",News/Global development,"Increased repression and violence a sign of weakness, says Human Rights Watch ",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/13/increased-repression-and-violence-a-sign-of-weakness-says-human-rights-watch
1/13/2022,"Sources inside Sydney’s Villawood detention centre say the Covid-19 outbreak at the facility is rampant, with nearly 70 infections – a tenfold increase in two days. Since Tuesday, when there were six cases, the Australian Border Force has refused to answer questions on how many Covid infections have been registered among the 450 people held within the nation’s largest immigration detention centre.  But several people inside the centre have told Guardian Australia that they understand there are at least 68 confirmed positive cases – a number that is expected to grow further among a population with a significantly lower vaccination rate than the rest of the country. Across Australia’s immigration detention system, 59% of people detained are fully vaccinated, compared to 78% of the general community, and 92% of those aged over 16. One person held in Villawood told the Guardian that the border force and Serco, the security contractor that runs the centre, were “playing catch up with the virus”, and the centre should have been alert to the possibility of an outbreak. “There have been plenty of warnings that have been ignored.” The person in detention said the centre switched to rapid antigen tests for suspected cases too late to stop the spread of the virus. “Why did they not follow the state prisons which have been using the RAT tests for months now? And now that they finally do switch it also comes at a point when your average Australian will find it hard to locate those tests.” The person said all medical appointments had been cancelled inside Villawood, and that the spread of the infection was likely far broader than the positive tests recorded. “Everyone is afraid to approach an officer if they are feeling off, because it’ll mean being sent to quarantine, where you might not have access to a power point to charge your phone that people use to stay in touch with loved ones.” Another source said the outbreak was “rampant” and that the centre “did not really know how many people have it”. The border force confirmed on Tuesday there were six infections inside Villawood, which houses detainees across a number of compounds, but has not responded to repeated queries since. “The priority for the ABF is the health and safety of detainees and staff in immigration detention facilities,” a spokesperson said on Tuesday. “All detainees continue to have ongoing access to the medical professionals located within facilities.” The spokesperson said the centre was following “standard departmental protocols”, including contact tracing, quarantining, testing and cleaning. Several people held at Villawood confirmed Covid cases are being quarantined in a previously disused compound within the centre. The ABF did not respond to queries about this. Ian Rintoul, a spokesperson for the Refugee Action Coalition, said “like other detention centres, Villawood has been a disaster waiting to happen”. “Despite previous Covid scares at Villawood the government has done nothing to safeguard the health and welfare of detainees. Vulnerable detainees should have been released long ago. “Government inaction and Covid protocol failures means that all of the 450 Villawood detainees are at high risk of infection. The staff shortages magnify the risk that the Villawood outbreak cannot be safely managed.” Rintoul said anybody at high risk inside Villawood should be immediately removed from the centre. “Many detainees have families that they could safely stay with.” In June last year, the Australian Human Rights Commission recommended the government “take urgent steps to significantly reduce the number of people in immigration detention facilities by releasing people into community-based alternatives”. The border force said its Covid-19 vaccine program for those in immigration detention started in August 2021 across all centres. Melbourne’s Park Hotel, where more than 30 refugees and asylum seekers remain in detention, was the site of a Covid outbreak in October and November. At one stage 22 people – almost half of those detained – tested positive. The tennis player Novak Djokovic was briefly detained in the hotel last week before his visa cancellation was overturned in the Federal Court. Before it was commandeered by the federal government as a detention centre, the hotel, then known as Rydges, was used for hotel quarantine of international arrivals and was the epicentre of Victoria’s second Covid wave. A Victorian government inquiry found “around 90 per cent of Covid-19 cases in Victoria since late May 2020 were attributable to the outbreak at Rydges”. Rydges was removed from the Victorian hotel quarantine program. The government inquiry found “insufficient regard was paid to infection prevention and control standards across the entire program and, particularly, to that location”. “There were consistent themes in the evidence and information provided to the Inquiry about concerns regarding matters including: access to fresh air; access to good quality food; the state of cleanliness of the facility.”",News/Australia news,"‘Rampant’: nearly 70 people have Covid at Sydney’s Villawood detention centre, sources say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/13/rampant-nearly-70-people-have-covid-at-sydneys-villawood-detention-centre-sources-say
1/13/2022,"France faces one of its biggest education strikes in decades on Thursday, when about 75% of teachers are expected to walk out, forcing the closure of half the country’s primary schools in protest at the government’s handling of Covid-19 measures in the education sector. President Emmanuel Macron this week restated the government view that one of France’s greatest successes during the pandemic had been to keep schools open more than any other country in the world. “I fundamentally believe the choice that we made to keep schools open is the right choice,” he said.  “France is the country that kept its schools open the most,” the education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has said. But a surge in Covid infections, driven by a sharp rise in the highly contagious Omicron variant, has created major disruption in schools since they reopened at the start of January – with about 10,000 classes closed because of infections among pupils and staff. Parents and children have faced long and often bewildering queues outside pharmacies to be tested in order to keep up with the requirements for pupils in a class where there has been a positive case. Testing rules for children have changed several times since the start of January. France’s prime minister, Jean Castex, finally announced this week that a series of home tests could now be used to determine whether a student can return to school. Children over the age of six must wear masks in French schools. Teaching unions said the government was failing children by a disorganised approach that provided inadequate protection against infection for staff and students alike, and failed to ensure replacement cover for teachers falling ill while leaving schools acting as a form of test-and-trace managers. “Students cannot learn properly because attendance varies wildly, and a hybrid of in-house and distance learning is impossible to put in place,” the SUNipp-FSU said, adding that absent teachers were not being replaced. Unions are also demanding the government provides the more protective FFP2 face masks for staff, and CO2 monitors to check whether classrooms are sufficiently ventilated. “Not only does the current protocol not protect students, staff or their families, it has completely disorganised schools,” the union said, claiming that classes have effectively been turned into “daycare centres”. In a rare move, France’s largest parents’ group, the FCPE, supported the strike, encouraging parents to keep their children home on Thursday. The group said France needed more saliva testing within schools, rather than lateral flow tests at home; a proper strategy to ensure distance learning; and to replace absent teachers. “Just keeping the school’s doors open isn’t enough,” Rodrigo Arenas, the co-president of the FCPE, told Le Monde. Valérie Pécresse, a key challenger to Macron in this spring’s presidential election race from the rightwing Les Républicains party, accused the government of disorder and chaos, saying it would have been better to defer the start of the January term to allow schools to prepare and to slow transmission rates. Blanquer argued this week that the government was doing everything possible to avoid outright school closures that could cause havoc for parents and jeopardise learning for thousands of children, especially those from low-income families. “I know there is a lot of fatigue, of anxiety … but you don’t go on strike against a virus,” he said in a TV interview.",News/World news,Half of France’s primary schools expected to close as teachers strike,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/13/half-of-french-primary-schools-expected-to-close-teachers-strike-protest-covid-education
