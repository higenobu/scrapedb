3/18/2022,"A New York police officer who made headlines after buying food for an alleged shoplifter is now suing the department and his captain over racial harassment and slurs following his good deed. In July 2019, Louis Sojo and a few other officers were asked to confront a woman who was suspected of shoplifting at a Whole Foods grocery store in New York City. Sojo found food containers in the woman’s bag, filled with food from the store’s hot food bar. The woman told Sojo she was hungry. The officers proceeded to pay for the woman’s food, each providing $10 to cover her meal. Despite receiving nationwide praise for his act, Sojo said he faced years of scorn from his superior, Capt Julio Delgado. In a new federal civil complaint, Sojo alleges that Delgado “was incensed, and berated and belittled him for the effort … by stating in front of Sojo’s subordinates that ‘you are not a real cop’”. Sojo, who is of Puerto Rican descent, also alleges that Delgado repeatedly referred to him by the derogatory term “spic”. Delgado also disparaged Sojo for owning a landscaping business, called him a “slumlord” and the “Spic Trump”, all while in front of other members of the police force, the lawsuit said. On numerous occasions, Sojo attempted to ask Delgado to stop his behavior and was instead faced with threats, according to the filing, and Delgado threatened to eliminate Sojo’s overtime, refused to assign him to desk duty, and refused to grant him the right to a meal and bathroom breaks. Sojo tried speaking to his supervisor, Chief John D’amo, as well as a lieutenant from NYPD’s special operations division, who oversaw complaints from Sojo’s unit, both to no avail. When Sojo first encountered Delgado as a fellow sergeant, he said that Delgado claimed Sojo’s locker as a “hazing antic” and “mutilated it such that Sojo had trouble getting into his locker each morning, causing Sojo to be late for roll call every tour”. “Sojo has suffered extreme economic, physical, mental and emotional damages as a direct result of the aforementioned discrimination, hostile work environment and retaliation,” the lawsuit said. Sojo is not the first person to file a lawsuit against Delgado. According to the lawsuit, “Delgado along with the city have been subjected to civil lawsuits concerning discrimination and retaliation, with respect to discrimination against other subordinate members of the service, one of whom was Muslim.” Sojo is currently suing the NYPD, Delgado and the City of New York for race discrimination and unequal treatment, color discrimination, retaliation and hostile work environment. He has demanded compensatory and punitive damages, the amounts of which have not been disclosed.",News/US news,"NYPD officer was harassed by superior after good deed, lawsuit alleges",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/17/nypd-officer-harassed-good-deed-lawsuit
3/18/2022,"The abusive treatment of Child Q in a school in London by the police (Racism cited as factor in police strip search of girl, 15, at London school, 15 March) must serve as a turning point in the discriminatory and harmful treatment of Black children and young people in schools and by police officers. The local child safeguarding practice review into Child Q’s case presents deeply distressing details about the way she was treated. Such traumatic experiences can cause lifelong harm to a child’s mental health. And they create distress and fear across whole communities. In this case, the lack of justice for Child Q sends out a message that Black lives still don’t matter, adding to the distress and trauma. Racial aggression and injustice are toxic to mental health. We know that racism is systemic and ingrained in our culture and institutions. Tackling it requires systemic change and concerted action at every level. School should be a safe place for everyone. Today, many Black girls will feel unsafe at school. This has got to stop.Sarah HughesChief executive, Centre for Mental Health  While the police’s behaviour has clearly been despicable, racist and probably unlawful in the case of Child Q, recent history has already, sadly, highlighted such traits in the Met. What we didn’t expect, and is profoundly shocking, is the reported behaviour of the schoolteachers involved. In loco parentis, their role of protecting, guiding and supporting their students was paramount, yet catastrophically betrayed in this incident. We learn the strip-search officers were women, and would hope the teachers in attendance outside the room were too. What on earth were they doing? How would they expect a daughter of theirs to be treated? A child arriving at school smelling of cannabis is a child needing support and family engagement. Instead, she was swept off to a medical room and placed in a hostile and intimidating situation when she was markedly vulnerable already, receiving no parental or in loco parentis protection or support. The teachers’ responsibility to involve a parent, to call a lawyer and, above all, to show care and compassion was jettisoned to the point that no parent or pupil can in future trust them. They should go and the headteacher and governors must be re-evaluated.Sue EvansLondon  There are two issues being overlooked in the case of Child Q. First, if you think that someone might have drugs hidden inside their body, they need to be taken to hospital immediately. There is a risk that a package could burst, creating a medical emergency. Examining the person can increase the risk of that happening. Hospitals also have the scanning equipment to establish if there is a foreign body present without the same level of risk. More importantly, an adolescent who might have drugs hidden in this way is much more likely to be a victim of coercion than a willing operative. Informed consent is essential at every stage. If relevant physical evidence is found, it needs to be clear that it will be used to prosecute the true perpetrator rather than their victim.Dr Michael PeelLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/18/2022,"Employment lawyers reacted with surprise after P&O Ferries sacked 800 seafarers out of the blue, warning it may have broken several laws and could be hit with claims for unfair dismissal. As staff staged sit-ins on the company’s boats, with the backing of their trade unions, experts cast doubts over the legality of P&O’s plot to replace them with cheaper agency workers. The affair could end up costing P&O “hundreds of thousands” in unfair dismissal payouts and penalties for legal breaches, they said. What laws is P&O accused of breaking? Employers are legally required to consult workers during a statutory notice period before making them redundant. P&O did not do this, so trade unions believe that its actions are likely to be unlawful. “For those staff who have been, or are about to be dismissed, they will certainly have claims for unfair dismissal,” said Rustom Tata, chairman and head of the employment group at law firm DMH Stallard, adding that elements of employment law appeared to have been “wholly ignored”. Further, employers wishing to make more than 100 redundancies must notify the business secretary at least 45 days in advance of those dismissals. On Thursday afternoon, a No10 spokesperson said: “We weren’t given any notice to this.” Failure to notify the secretary of state would be a breach of the Trade Union & Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, the TUC said. Unions representing P&O workers have been consulting lawyers with a view to taking legal action. Redundancy notices are being issued, with the P&O apparently having recognised the unlawfulness of its actions with comments that enhanced compensation will be paid. P&O’s offer of “enhanced” redundancy packages indicates that it may have “recognised the unlawfulness of its actions”, according to Tata. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: “If P&O breached the law they must suffer severe consequences – with ministers increasing the legal penalties if necessary. If one employer gets away with this, every worker is at risk.” Is this “fire and rehire”? Fire and rehire is a hugely controversial method used by some companies, usually – but not always – when in dire financial straits. It involves sacking staff and then telling them they can apply for their old jobs on less favourable terms. Companies that have deployed the tactic include Weetabix, Tesco, British Airways, Heathrow and British Gas. Trade unions and the public support a ban on the practice but ministers last year blocked a bill that aimed to do just that. The government would be “dismayed” if P&O were doing this, a No10 spokesperson said. But what P&O is trying to do looks slightly different. Rather than rehiring staff to their old jobs, it is replacing them with agency workers and saying that sacked staff could, if they wanted, join those agencies. “That is effectively seeking to avoid having to renegotiate terms with staff and their representatives,” said Tata. The TUC said it was not yet clear if P&O was planning to rehire staff on inferior terms but warned it was a growing trend, with 9% of workers affected by such a scheme in the first year of the pandemic. What now for P&O workers? Some are staging sit-ins aboard the company’s ferries, with the support of unions such as the RMT and Nautilus International. Kathryn Evans, head of employment at law firm Trethowans, reckons staff could end up being paid “hundreds of thousands of pounds in failure to consult and unfair dismissal awards.” But Tata warned that the sit-ins could prompt a backlash from the company too. “The question may become whether it is lawful and reasonable for the employer to require the employee to leave the vessel and what the impact will be of an employee refusing to do so,” he said. “Might any unfair dismissal compensation be reduced to nil? Given the employer’s approach it is quite likely that the employees will find considerable sympathy in the employment tribunal – albeit when any case is finally heard.”",News/Law,What are the legal implications of P&O Ferries sacking 800 staff?,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/17/what-are-the-legal-implications-of-po-ferries-sacking-800-staff

Why trust them to solve the energy crisis now?, 15 March), but it is unfair to describe those opposing gigantic windfarms and solar farms as “shire nimbys”. There are many environmentalists who don’t feel such massive industrialisation of our land and seascapes is necessary. Insulting anyone who opposes ugly and often highly profitable developments in the name of progress by calling them nimbys has a long history – those fighting to save Covent Garden from demolition, Welsh mining communities opposing windfarms, communities saving swathes of east London from elevated motorways, and in Brighton it was local people who rejected the wholesale demolition of now thriving neighbourhoods through the creation of conservation areas. As Joni Mitchell said, “You don’t know what you’ve got till its gone”. Let’s focus on insulation to keep people warm and lower their costs (and create skilled jobs), and on reducing carbon emissions and increasing energy security, not vanity projects for politicians and private developers.Diane OrdishBrighton  George Monbiot is right that agricultural land should not be given over to biomass energy production, which may be carbon neutral long term, but still releases lots of CO2 when burned (There are solutions to the food crisis.

While Polly Toynbee, also rightly, excoriates the Cameron administration for shredding progress towards renewable energy, she complains that “local protesters … fight large solar farms”. And so they should, for the same reason Monbiot challenges biomass farms. I’m all for solar panels (my roof is covered in them), but that’s where they should be – on roofs.

3/18/2022,"The shirtmaker TM Lewin has called in administrators for the second time in less than two years, becoming the latest victim of the general shift to working from home. The business, which operated 150 shops before the pandemic, has operated a solely online business since first calling in administrators in June 2020. As well as its specialism, shirts, it sells suits, knitwear, coats and accessories such as ties. Founded by Thomas Mayes Lewin and Geoffrey James Lewin on Panton Street, London, in 1898, the partners established themselves on nearby Jermyn Street, the home of English shirtmaking, in 1903. The firm supplied the RAF and British Army with uniforms during the first world war and made its shirts in Southend, Essex, until the late 1980s when it moved production overseas. The group, which was bought out of administration in 2020 by Torque Brands, which is part of the US-based Stonebridge Private Equity, currently employs about 50 staff, whose jobs are now at risk. Will Wright and Chris Pole of Interpath Advisory, the joint administrators, said that since the buyout the business had “continued to be negatively impacted” by pandemic restrictions on large events and social gatherings which had reduced demand for its shirts. Formalwear brands have also been hit by the switch to working from home and the increasingly casual approach to dress for those heading into the office. TM Lewin’s administration comes after the tailor Gieves & Hawkes was put into liquidation in January and the shirt brand Pink was shut down by its owner, LVMH, in January last year, although it recently relaunched online. The fellow tailoring brand Austin Reed and the womenswear brand Jaeger collapsed into administration in November 2020, with Jaeger later being bought out by Marks & Spencer. Fashion brands have also been suffering from a general shift in spending towards tech such as mobile phones, digital services such as streaming and gaming, and experiences such as dining out or holidays. Wright said: “Over the course of the pandemic, men’s apparel – and formalwear in particular – has been one of the hardest-hit parts of the retail sector, as work-from-home measures and restrictions on events meant demand for suits and formal tailoring waned.” He added that despite “significant restructuring at the start of the pandemic which saw it move to an online model, the impact on this famous British brand has been severe”. The joint administrators are now aiming to sell the business. Potential buyers could include Marks & Spencer and Next, both of which have been taking interests in brands in a bid to broaden their appeal. Next has already signed deals to run the UK arms of lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret, which fell into administration in 2020 and the casual clothing retailer Gap, which closed all its UK stores last year.",News/Business,TM Lewin calls in administrators for second time in two years,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/tm-lewin-calls-in-administrators-for-second-time-in-two-years
3/18/2022,"Campaigners are to appeal after a court ruled the government had acted lawfully by allowing councils to place looked-after children aged 16 and 17 in “unregulated” accommodation without care or supervision. They had argued that legislation introduced last year was discriminatory because it required local authorities to provide minimum accommodation standards for children in care aged 15 or under, but not for those who were older, leaving the latter group at risk of abuse. About 6,000 children in care are thought to live in unregistered accommodation in England such as bedsits, shared houses, hostels, and in some cases caravans, boats or barges, raising fears this leaves them exposed to exploitation by gangs. Critics say this type of accommodation effectively leaves vulnerable looked-after children to fend for themselves with minimal support, and in often inappropriate settings. Twenty-nine children aged 16 and 17 have died in the past five years while living in unregistered accommodation. However, the judge, Mr Justice Holgate, ruled that despite “troubling examples” of children suffering exploitation, it was the case that independent and semi-independent accommodation was the “most appropriate solution” for some 16- and 17-year-olds. On that basis it could not be irrational to draw a distinction on the basis of age, he said, concluding the education secretary was “legally entitled to take the view that unregulated accommodation of a sufficiently high quality may continue [for 16- and 17-year-olds]”. Carolyne Willow, the director of the campaign group Article 39, which brought the case, said: “This is a very upsetting judgment because of the profound implications for children in care. There is no question that children will continue to be placed in wholly unsuitable accommodation.” She added: “Ministers were pushed into taking action because of mounting evidence of the harms suffered by children in care living in properties that bypass ordinary care standards. Instead of protecting all children, they decided to create a two-tier system where children in care aged 15 and under will always be cared for where they live, and those aged 16 and 17 can go without care in their home.” The court heard that there was a national shortage of suitably regulated accommodation. Barring 16- and 17-year-olds from unregulated homes would, according to the Department for Education (DfE), require 6,000 new placements in children’s homes or foster care to be created at a cost of £500m. The government has said it will introduce new minimum quality standards for all unregulated accommodation. The majority of providers are privately owned, and the average cost of an unregulated place is £948 a week, with average operating profits of £330 a week, according to the Competition and Markets Authority. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We welcome this decision which notes that the department has acted fairly and lawfully. “We have already banned the placement of under-16s in unregulated provision and are introducing mandatory national standards and provider-level Ofsted inspection of these placements. The independent review of children’s social care will also address growing pressures in the care system.”",News/Society,"Government lawful in allowing 16- and 17-year-olds in unregulated care, court rules",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/17/government-lawful-in-allowing-16--and-17-year-olds-in-unregulated-care-court-rules
3/18/2022,"Sound the Riverdance klaxon. Stroke a lucky fake leprechaun beard. On 17 March at Cheltenham, let no knobbly stick go unwaved. For all its convivial, booze-soaked similarities to every other Festival day, a St Patrick’s Day at the Festival typically comes packed with a little more oomph. For “oomph”, confected marketing blarney, whether it’s the branded green scarves distributed by a well-known banter bookie, or the occasionally grating misuse of that byword for diddly-aye shamrockery that is “craic”. Which is not to say the Cheltenham Festival has not had a long, hugely profitable and mutually agreeable relationship with the Irish, who have always been happy to immerse themselves fully in its welcoming embrace. Hyped up paddywhackery is habitually sold by broadcasters, bookies and the Jockey Club in their efforts to promote an apparently fierce four-day rivalry between the British and Irish, when in truth any perceived hostilities between the hosts and their bawdy visitors have always been completely contrived. A sport in which winning is everything and competing owners, jockeys and trainers could scarcely be less concerned by the particular mast to which their national colours are nailed, horse racing is actually one of few sporting pursuits in which a simmering undercurrent of animosity between the two nations doesn’t exist. While the assorted members of the Irish Flooring Porter syndicate stole Thursday’s show with their bravura celebrations following the Stayers’ Hurdle, the mish-mash of accents from both sides of the Irish sea that roared Allaho and Paul Townend up the home straight in the Ryanair Chase demonstrated a more mundane truth. Most racegoers could not care less which trainer’s yard the horse on which they have bet their money has travelled from, as long as their selection wins. “Football can be tribal but it’s not tribal here at all,” says ITV Racing frontman Ed Chamberlin, dressed appropriately for the day that was in it in an emerald green coat. “It’s all just good natured and friendly. It’s called one of the great rivalries in sport because it’s just got this undercurrent of happiness, summed up by the Guinness village, where everyone mingles and has a great time. We experienced Cheltenham without racegoers last year and it was miserable. It was desolate and it just wasn’t Cheltenham. This year, Cheltenham is Cheltenham again and the Irish are a big part of it because without them it’s just not the same.” While Delta Work’s mugging of his universally revered stablemate Tiger Roll in Tuesday’s Cross Country Chase provided as clear an example as you’ll ever see that racing is a game in which it’s every man for himself, the largely unimportant Prestbury Cup results do at least serve the purpose of demonstrating where the financial clout in National Hunt racing currently lies. At last year’s Festival, Irish trainers saddled a record 23 winners in 28 races over four days, rubberstamping their dominance of almost a decade. It was not ever thus, however – in 1989 they went home empty-handed for the first time in 50 years to nobody’s great surprise. This time around, after a good showing during the first two days when UK trainers were lagging just two wins behind their Irish counterparts after 14 races, it was suggested that Ireland might pull off an unprecedented “greenwash” by blitzing through Thursday’s seven-race St Patrick’s Day card. Indeed, such was the certainty that an Irish trainer would prevail in the Turners Novice Chase, duly won by the Henry de Bromhead-trained Bob Olinger, that there were just four entries and for the first time in Festival history, no English horses entered the race. Any prospective Irish St Patrick’s Day clean sweep came quickly unstuck, when Third Wind, out of Hughie Morrison’s decidedly English East Ilsley yard, led home a British one-two-three in the Pertemps Handicap Hurdle. An unfancied 25-1 shot, his victory prompted polite but unenthusiastic applause from the grandstand and a deluge of discarded betting slips but little or nothing in the way of bombastic Last Night At The Proms’s style patriotic fervour. As if to confirm the hoary old saw that nobody anywhere knows anything, he was the first of four British winners on the day. This year, almost certainly in a nod to the deprivations visited upon involuntarily housebound racegoers by Covid-19 last year, record ticket sales meant all general admission enclosures for Gold Cup Day at the Cheltenham Festival sold out before the end of January for the very first time. Although race organisers have no way of knowing exactly how many of the visitors are Irish, reasonably well informed estimates suggest visitors from Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports make up at least a third of each day’s Festival crowd. According to an Economic Impact Analysis commissioned by Cheltenham Racecourse from the University of Gloucestershire, Irish fans bought 57,375 tickets for the Festival in 2016, which amounted to a healthy 30% of all those sold. In terms of competing horses, Irish trainers saddled a quarter of the runners in 2014, a figure that steadily increased to a smidge over 40% of the collective field last year. Over the first three days of this year’s Festival, Irish entrants currently stand at an even larger 43%. Along with their British counterparts, they have all been paraded in front of a podium adjacent to a Cheltenham weighing room proudly flying the blue and yellow flag of Ukraine – a country all connected to this year’s Festival can unequivocally get behind.",Sport/Sport,No knobbly stick goes unwaved on St Patrick’s Day at Cheltenham,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/17/no-knobbly-stick-goes-unwaved-on-st-patricks-day-at-cheltenham-festival-horse-racing
3/18/2022,"Victims of trafficking have secured two significant victories in the courts in separate rulings which have condemned the Home Office and the Crown Prosecution Service. In one case the police initially refused to investigate a UAE diplomat over a woman’s complaint of trafficking claiming that the suspect had diplomatic immunity, but the high court found the CPS’s decision not to prosecute unlawful. While in the other the home secretary tried to get a high court ruling from last October which granted thousands of confirmed trafficking victims leave to remain in the UK overturned. That was rejected by the court of appeal. In the first case a woman from the Philippines worked for Abdulla Salem Mohammed Sultan Aljaberi, a former assistant military attache at the UAE embassy in London. She accepted a job with his family in February 2013 when he was posted to the UK. She was paid just 41p an hour – a fraction of the £1,000 a month she was promised – required to work 14 or 15 hours a day, and claims that she was not given any holiday. She also alleges that she was locked in the diplomat’s home most of the time and was not always fed properly. She managed to escape in May 2013 and in November 2014 was recognised as a victim of trafficking by the Home Office. However, repeated attempts to get the Crown Prosecution Service to prosecute Aljaberi, now believed to be back in UAE, failed. A high court ruling has found that the CPS’s decision not to prosecute Aljaberi was unlawful. In their ruling the judges found that the CPS had failed to apply the law correctly in the case. Zubier Yazdani of Deighton Pierce Glynn, who represented the trafficking victim, said: “Our client suffered appalling treatment from her former employers and has then been forced to fight every step of the way to try to get the authorities in the UK to recognise the wrongs she suffered. We hope this decision will force the CPS to look again at the way they treat the prosecution of offences relating to domestic servitude.” A CPS spokesperson said: “Modern slavery is an abhorrent crime and one the CPS works with partners to tackle. The CPS will look again at this case.” In the second case the home secretary tried to get a high court ruling from last October overturned, which granted thousands of confirmed trafficking victims leave to remain in the UK. But three court of appeal judges rejected her appeal. Prior to the ruling, people the UK government accepted as foreign victims of trafficking were often sent back to their home countries, where they could be at risk of being trafficked again by the same people. The original case against the Home Office was brought by a 33-year-old Vietnamese woman. She was forced into sex work in Vinh City in Vietnam for about six months in 2016 before being forced to the UK by her traffickers. Between November 2016 and March 2018 she was forced to work in brothels and in cannabis production. In April 2018 she was recognised as a victim of trafficking, yet in October 2018 she was charged with conspiring to produce cannabis and pleaded guilty at Preston crown court. In December 2018 she was sentenced to 28 months’ imprisonment. Although she was recognised as a trafficking victim by the Home Office, her asylum appeal is ongoing. Ahmed Aydeed, solicitor at Duncan Lewis representing the trafficking victim, said: “We welcome the court of appeal’s landmark ruling. For too long victims of trafficking have been left in this legal limbo, this half world where they have to remain in the UK but cannot plan any real part in society. This ruling will have a huge real-world effect as thousands of victims of trafficking in similar circumstances will be granted leave to remain.” Writing for the Guardian Sara Thornton, the UK’s independent anti-slavery commissioner called for changes to the law allowing confirmed victims of trafficking more chance of being allowed to remain in the UK.

3/18/2022,"Why are Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates being asked to pump more oil? Western powers are looking for ways to keep the pressure on Russia during its invasion of Ukraine. Some countries have committed to phasing out Russian oil and gas, while others are still investigating ways of doing this. Saudi Arabia is one of a number of countries, along with Venezuela and Iran, that might be able to plug the gap in oil production. How important is Saudi Arabia as an oil producer? Saudi Arabia has an estimated 17% of the world’s proven petroleum reserves. Saudi Aramco, the state-owned company which handles Saudi oil, is the world’s largest oil exporter, and one of the world’s most profitable companies. In 2019, in an unexpected move, a tiny part of the company went public. It raised less than Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s ruler, had reportedly hoped for, but still brought in about $25bn. The UAE, meanwhile, holds the estimated seventh largest reserves in the world. Are Saudi Arabia and the UAE going to open the taps to oblige the west? Boris Johnson went to Riyadh to ask if the Saudis would consider increasing their output, but so far the answer appears to be no. He also approached the UAE. However, the relationship between Saudi Arabia and western countries has been fairly frosty in the aftermath of the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Relations with the UAE are not at their best either. Meanwhile Riyadh has been coordinating oil supply levels with Moscow over the last few years, although that has also not been smooth. Saudi Arabia was reported on Thursday to be considering accepting the Chinese yuan in exchange for oil, rather than the traditional dollar. Does Saudi Arabia have any plans to decarbonise? How realistic are they? Prince Mohammed has said Saudi Arabia aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, with initial investments of more than 700bn riyals ($187bn). They are investing heavily in renewables. The Saudis often cite the circular carbon economy, in which CO2 is captured and then re-used, recycled or removed. Its deployment depends heavily on technologies that are still not commercially proven. In an interview with Time magazine, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said that although it would pump more oil, “we can become more efficient, by installing insulation for buildings, by having more efficient standards for industry, and so on. And we can take the CO2 that was committed to the atmosphere and use it in a valuable application, say for a food or beverage company, as a valuable product, so it becomes a material, instead of discarding it.” Both countries are also members of the Middle East Green Initiative, a regional pact on climate change agreed last autumn. If Saudi Arabia does decide to pump more oil, what will be the implications for the climate? Prof Simon Evans of Carbon Brief says: “Ordinarily you’d say higher production means higher emissions, but the current situation is unusual. It’s at least possible that higher production from Saudi and others could allow Europe to cut purchases from Russia. And if Russia’s exports are geographically constrained (eg pipeline or lack of refinery capacity able to take Russian-grade crude elsewhere) or otherwise struggling to find buyers, then it could have to cut production.

3/18/2022,"In seeking to extract a loved one from the clutches of an authoritarian regime, is it best to follow the advice of the UK Foreign Office and leave it to the discreet professionalism of the diplomatic class, or take a leap into the unknown and go public? Kim Darroch, the former UK ambassador to Washington, hesitated before agreeing on ITV’s Peston this week that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, had probably been right to ignore the Foreign Office advice. Ratcliffe told the Guardian three years ago that he simply could not discuss the wisdom of his tactics. He had made his decision to go public, it could not be undone, and when his wife was released he might have the privilege to reflect. More recently, he said he was sure he had been right, and that without the support of the public she would not have been released. Tulip Siddiq, his MP and a great ally for anyone’s campaign, agreed, but speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme she said the Foreign Office had repeatedly told her and Ratcliffe that “they would have been able to get her out earlier if Richard did not make such a song and dance about it”. Since history is irreversible, it is impossible to know whether the outcome would have been different if Ratcliffe had taken a different fork in the road and stayed quiet. Evidence flows both ways. Jimmy Carter, as US president, tried every technique, from disastrously sending in the Marines to unfreezing billions in assets, to secure the release of hostages trapped in the US embassy in Tehran in 1979. The Iranians danced on Carter’s political grave by not sending the hostages home until 20 minutes into his successor, Ronald Reagan’s, inauguration speech. In Britain, some lower-profile British-Iranians have returned home after shorter periods in Iranian jails. In 2019 authorities forced the Economist journalist Nicolas Pelham to stay for nearly two months in Tehran, although not in jail, and he was extricated by the Foreign Office without any publicity. The family of the businessman Kamal Foroughi only divulged his arrest in October 2015, four years after it happened. Other dual nationals remain in detention with no access to publicity. Ana Diamond, arrested in 2016 and released in 2020, said: “There is probably not one formula for success or one size fits all. It feels as if you go halfway, there are more negative repercussions. If you go all in like Richard Ratcliffe, or Jason Rezaian with the backing of his employer, Washington Post, and you know you can sustain a campaign, then it probably works.” But others who have been arrested, such as the Australian-British academic Kylie Moore-Gilbert, released in November 2020 after 804 days in Iranian prisons, say the sunlight of publicity can help with the conditions prisoners have to endure. It is possible that each case is best examined on its merits. The point that Ratcliffe was able to latch on to was the nexus between the decades-old unpaid UK debt to Iran and his wife’s detention, something that was not apparent at the outset but became obvious as public attention grew. He has also argued that publicity was vital to expose the growing practice of hostage-taking. In his final angry letter to the Foreign Office – written on Friday, unaware of the deals under way – Ratclffe’s biggest request was for it to call hostage-taking by its name. The weeks ahead will show whether the Foreign Office takes up that call.",News/News,Publicity or silence?

3/18/2022,"All the company’s ferry services are currently suspended. P&O normally operates 14 services a day between Dover and Calais, three between Liverpool and Dublin, and seven on the increasingly important freight route between Larne in County Antrim and Cairnryan in Dumfries and Galloway. There is also normally an overnight ferry from Hull to Rotterdam. This has been cancelled, along with all other services. On the Dover-Calais route there is plenty of capacity for those looking to take a car over to France. Rival operator DFDS has ferries running every 40 minutes or so to Calais or Dunkirk. P&O ticket holders are being directed to these services, and it appears DFDS is accepting P&O tickets, although this is unconfirmed. In its latest posting, P&O says: “If travelling on our Dover/Calais route please arrive at the port as booked and we will arrange to get you away on an alternative carrier as quickly as possible. Once at the port please make your way to the DFDS check-in booths.” Those hoping to take ferries to Ireland face having to switch ferry company, and to buy a new reservation. Stena Line runs from Cairnryan to Belfast while Irish Ferries operates from Holyhead to Dublin. Those travelling from Hull to Rotterdam face the biggest disruption and longest drives. Stena offers Harwich to the Hook of Holland – the nearest replacement for those needing to travel urgently. P&O will have to refund passengers for crossings not taken. With not many car drivers travelling on ferries right now, the biggest disruption to services will be to truck operators. Queues of trucks have already built up in Kent. The company accounts for about 15% of UK freight movements so some knock-on effects can be expected, and trade to Ireland will be affected. P&O Cruises is owned by Carnival, and is therefore completely unaffected by this. P&O has said the disruption will last several days. It is unclear how long it will take the company to remove existing staff who are understandably furious at their treatment. The RMT union has instructed members to stay onboard their vessels once they have docked or risk being “locked out” of their jobs. “We are digging in for the long haul. We are determined to fight,” RMT spokesperson Geoff Martin said. Meanwhile, it remains to be seen how long it takes the company to train up the new agency staff that have reportedly been brought in to replace them. If other support workers at the affected docks refuse to work with the company, this could easily escalate into a protracted dispute. The company is still trading, and has made it very clear that it is not going into liquidation. In theory this means nothing has changed and the company should honour your summer booking and allow passengers to use credit vouchers that they accepted in lieu of cancelled trips last year. If the company did collapse, future reservation and voucher holders would then face a battle to recoup their funds. Travel insurers and credit card companies would be expected to step in for some (but not all) customers. Possibly. Passengers who booked the company’s most expensive Fully Flexi, and the medium priced Standard Flexi tickets are refundable, meaning passengers could cancel without financial penalty. Those who booked the cheapest Saver tickets are stuck with non-refundable tickets. There would be nothing to stop you cancelling but it would be at your expense. It is highly likely. By Thursday afternoon many had expressed their outrage on Twitter. Car drivers are important, but for a boycott to really have an effect it would have to include freight operators. They typically care less for employee rights but equally many will be frustrated at the way the company has gone about this. Truck drivers have described waiting hours at Calais with no P&O staff in sight.",News/Business,P&O ferries shutout: your consumer questions answered,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/p-and-o-ferries-shutout-your-consumer-questions-answered
