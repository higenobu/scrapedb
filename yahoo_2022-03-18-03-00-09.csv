3/18/2022,"For nearly 15 years, Anita Knutson’s family anxiously waited for authorities to track down who was responsible for brutally murdering the 18-year-old Minot State University student inside her off-campus apartment. That day finally arrived this week with the arrest of 34-year-old Nichole Rice, who was Knutson’s roommate and had previously told police she was out of town at her parents’ house at the time of the June 4, 2007, murder. Rice, who was arrested at the Minot Air Force Base, where she works as a civilian, is facing a murder charge and being held at the Ward County Jail. It was not immediately clear if Rice has retained an attorney, but she was set to make her initial court appearance on Thursday afternoon. “Although most of the detectives who worked the original scene and investigation have retired, we have not forgotten about this case,” Minot Police Chief John Klug said in a press conference announcing the charges on Wednesday. “It was good to know that finally the one case that we’ve had hanging out there that we just could not get to a solution was finally over.” The arrest comes two months after Knutson’s sister spoke with The Daily Beast about the unsolved cold case that rocked rural North Dakota. While Rice had not been publicly named as a suspect at the time, Anna Knutson told The Daily Beast rumors swirled around her sister’s roommate shortly after the murder. “There was a conversation about Anita’s roommate about them just not getting along. Even now, there are a lot of questions about what their relationship was like,” Anna Knutson told The Daily Beast in January. “I do think it’s very weird. I did go to high school with the roommate too, I know her family. It’s just hard to imagine.” The Unsolved Pocket-Knife Murder of an Aspiring Teacher Anna Knutson declined to comment on Rice’s arrest on Thursday, telling The Daily Beast that she was “not ready to talk with anyone.” While authorities have not yet provided details on what ultimately led to Rice’s arrest, Chief Klug told The Daily Beast in January that the roommate had never been ruled out as a suspect. “I think the turning point in this case was really just trying to pull all that information together and put it in an order that made sense,” he told reporters Wednesday. Police say Knutson was found fatally stabbed, face-down on her own bed, by her father and two maintenance workers. A robe covered her bloodied body, and the pocket knife that police believed was used to murder her was close by. Her father, Former Butte Mayor Gordon Knutson, had gone to her apartment—about an hour from their tiny North Dakota down—after the teenager did not respond to her family’s calls all weekend while they were in Bismarck for her brother’s baseball tournament. Klug previously told The Daily Beast that the last time anyone heard from Anita was that Saturday. Crime-scene analysis later concluded that Knutson had been dead for more than a day before her father burst into her locked apartment with the help of the two workers. While there was no evidence of sexual abuse or defense wounds, Klug noted that Anita was found wearing a robe. Just 15 at the time, Anna previously told The Daily Beast that she learned about her sister’s murder when her brother abruptly picked her up at a friend’s house. “I remember I got in the car and he had clearly been crying,” Anna said. “It was not a super normal thing for my brother to do, and he wouldn’t tell me anything. So I just started naming people. Like, ‘Is it mom, is it our Aunt Karen, or Uncle Joe?’ ‘Is it Anita?’” “And then he started crying and kind of looked at me and said, ‘She’s dead,” Anna continued. “I just remember the whole car ride, we sat in silence. It was about a 30-minute ride home.” The grisly murder immediately prompted outrage across North Dakota as authorities scrambled to find her killer, which included taking DNA samples from everyone close to Knutson. Among those interviewed was Anita’s roommate. “There was never enough to arrest her but I would say she was always a person of interest in this case,” Klug said on Wednesday about Rice. Despite the local pressure, the case remained unsolved—a horror that Anna previously suggested may have contributed to her brother’s demise. On April 9, 2013, Daniel Knutson died by suicide. Anna said that their sister’s death was particularly devastating for her brother and the incident changed him and “caused a lot of pain.” “My heart goes out to the family,” Klug said at Wednesday’s press conference announcing the arrest. “I wish we could have solved this sooner, but at the same time, I’m glad to say that we have the person responsible for the murder of Anita Knutson in custody.” If you or a loved one are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741 Read more at The Daily Beast.

3/18/2022,"U.S. Army veteran Matthew Parker couldn’t stand seeing the images of Ukrainians fleeing homes that were being destroyed by Russian forces. But it was the plea from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the formation of an “international legion” that gave Parker the final push to enter the fray. “It’s not easy for any human being to watch suffering. It’s really not easy for a soldier who’s been in combat to see it. Because we’ve seen it up close. It could have been avoidable. The Russians are violating the law of war by doing what they’re doing,” Parker told Yahoo News. He cited the Russian invasion’s increasing brutality toward Ukraine’s civilian population, of which 3 million have already fled the war and countless others huddled in shelters amid artillery and missile barrages. “Every hospital that is bombed, every baby that’s killed, every pregnant woman that’s killed, there’s an orphan. That’s all our problem,” Parker said. Parker joined the U.S. Army in 1990, fighting in both Bosnia and Iraq, and retired at the end of 2011. He returned home to South Carolina and has dedicated his time to his security training business. Parker, who has four children, said he never envisioned returning to combat. But he said he views fighting for Ukraine as a continuation of his service — this time for democracy. “Every single one of us, when we joined, we raised our right hand and promised that we would support and defend the Constitution of the United States. We accepted a role beyond us,” he said. “To me this is a continuation of what we signed on for to support and defend. But in this case, it may not be the Constitution of the United States. This is more serving mankind, serving people. What [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is doing is wrong,” he said. As Parker prepares to leave for Ukraine on Thursday, he said his personal mission is to find the family of a Ukrainian soldier he knew who served alongside U.S. forces in Iraq. “I love that kid. I really do. He’s like one of my own kids. I wouldn’t tell him that,” he said. “I’m gonna go find them. I will find his mother, I’ll find his sister and daughter. If they’re still somewhere near Odesa, I will go find them. And if I can get them to safety, I will. If they’re safe, you know, I still want to check in on them and see how they’re doing,” he said.",World/Yahoo News,U.S. veteran volunteers to fight in Ukraine: 'A continuation of what we signed on for',https://news.yahoo.com/us-veteran-volunteers-to-fight-in-ukraine-a-continuation-of-what-we-signed-on-for-170111066.html
3/18/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia's Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) said on Thursday it was conducting ""anti-cartel"" inspections at major sugar producers following a sharp increase in sugar prices and ""unjustified"" shortages in some regions as shoppers rushed to buy. Unverified video footage shot in Russia's regions in recent days and posted on social media has shown pensioners in supermarkets jostling one another as they compete to grab as many bags of sugar as they can. Many Russians regard sugar, along with staples, such as buckwheat and salt, as a useful product to stockpile at times of crisis and have hurried to buy supplies after Western sanctions on Russia over the conflict in Ukraine weakened the rouble and sent food prices higher. ""My mother-in-law was in the shop yesterday and there was no sugar left at all and she couldn't find it in other shops too,"" said Oleg, a builder in the city of Vladimir. ""People are worried."" Annual inflation in Russia reached its highest level since late 2015 as of March 11 and sugar prices have jumped 12.8% in the last week, data from statistics service Rosstat showed on Wednesday. The authorities have told people there are no grounds to rush to buy food products. ""The absence of sugar on shop shelves in several regions is due to a rush in demand, which is being fuelled by dishonest organisations,"" FAS, the anti-monopoly organisation, said, adding that it was inspecting sugar producers, retail chains and intermediaries. Promsvyazbank analysts said the shortages were caused by consumer behaviour and not any lack of products. It said sugar sales had increased around 6.5 times since the beginning of March. EXPORT BAN Russia has banned sugar exports until Aug. 31 and set a duty-free quota for imports of 300,000 tonnes of sugar and raw sugar as part of measures it hopes will ease domestic food inflation. Those measures, along with a planned increase in the country's 2022 sugar beet sowing area by 1.1 million hectares, will increase domestic supply, the agriculture ministry said earlier this week. ""We have no problems with sugar, our producers are producing it in sufficient quantities,"" Viktor Evtukhov, deputy industry and trade minister, said on Thursday. ""Given the decision taken to ban exports and allow free imports of this product, we really do not expect any shortages of this good, which is in very high demand from the population today."" Two vessels carrying 88,000 tonnes of raw sugar are on their way from Brazil to Russia's Black Sea port, the IKAR consultancy said in a note. Russian retailer Magnit hired additional workers to boost its sugar packaging capacity to speed up delivery to shelves in its stores, it said, but does not expect shortages. ""Of course we are seeing a momentary increase in demand on specific types of groceries and non-food products, but we think this is a temporary pattern and the process will stabilise in the near future,"" said Magnit board member Anna Meleshina.

3/18/2022,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is making an appeal to the Russian people amid Putin's invasion of Ukraine. The action star and former California governor shared a nine-minute video to his social media pages calling for an end to the war — and telling Russian soldiers and citizens, who have their media controlled and censored by the government, that ""Ukraine did not start this war."" ""I am speaking to you today because there are things that are going on in the world that are being kept from you, terrible things that you should know about,"" the global superstar, who visited Russia many times for work and as a tourist, began his message. The Terminator star, 74, went on to say that because of his affection for the Russian people, he wanted to share the ""truth"" about the war. ""No one likes to hear something critical of their government. I understand that. But as a longtime friend of the Russian people, I hope you will hear what I have to say."" Schwarzenegger said, ""I know your government told you this is a war to denazify Ukraine. Denazify Ukraine? This is not true. Ukraine is a country with a Jewish president,"" President Zelenskyy. ""A Jewish president I might add whose father's three brothers were all murdered by the Nazis. ""You see, Ukraine did not start this war. Neither did nationalists or Nazis. Those in power in the Kremlin started this war. This is not the Russian people's war."" Schwarzenegger talked about the United Nations vote in which 141 countries condemned Russia for starting the war and demanded the and withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. Only four countries sided with Russia. ""The world has turned against Russia because of its actions in Ukraine,"" said Schwarzenegger, who showed video footage of a bombed orphanage, hospital maternity ward and displaced refugees — 3 million and counting. Schwarzenegger said the government hasn't just been lying to citizens but to its soldiers. They've been given fake reasons for the war — and some soldiers weren't even told they were going into battle, leaving them unprepared and putting their lives at risk. He shared a personal story comparing what Russian soldiers have been told to his Austrian father being lied to by his government when he was a Nazi soldier. ""He lived the rest of his life in pain,"" Schwarzenegger said of his father, both physically and mentally ""from the guilt he felt."" ""To the Russian soldiers listening to this broadcast, you already know much of the truth that I've been speaking,"" he said. ""You have seen it with your own eyes. I don't want you to be broken like my father. This is not the war to defend Russia that your grandfathers or great-grandfathers fought. This is an illegal war."" Schwarzenegger called on Russians to help spread the truth about the ""human catastrophe that is happening in Ukraine."" To President Vladimir Putin, Schwarzenegger sent a direct message: ""You started this war. You are leading this war. You can stop this war."" Schwarzenegger concluded his video by applauding the bravery of Russian protestors who have spoken out against the war and faced consequences for it. ""You are my new heroes,"" he said. ""You have the true heart of Russia."" Schwarzenegger's message, which has gone viral, is being sent at a time in which Russia is tightly controlling how news is being reported within the country. The government has also censored the internet, blocking various news sites as well as social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Arnold Schwarzenegger shared his attacks on the Russian attacks on Ukraine in a message to Russian soldiers and others in the country.",World/Yahoo Celebrity,Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers message to Russian people: 'Ukraine did not start this war',https://news.yahoo.com/arnold-schwarzenegger-message-to-russian-people-162121993.html
