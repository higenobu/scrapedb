1/14/2022,"The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack subpoenaed Twitter, Meta, Alphabet and Reddit on Thursday for records related to the 6 January insurrection, as it seeks to review data that could potentially incriminate the Trump White House. Facebook is part of Meta and Google is part of Alphabet.  The move by the select committee suggests the panel is ramping up its examination of social media posts and messages that could provide evidentiary evidence as to who might have been in contact with the Trump White House around 6 January, one source said. Congressman Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the select committee, said in a statement that he authorized the four subpoenas since those platforms were used to communicate plans about the Capitol attack, and yet the social media companies ignored earlier requests. The subpoenas to the four social media companies were the last straw for the select committee after repeated engagements with the platforms went unheeded, Thompson said in letters that amounted to stinging rebukes over the platforms’ lack of cooperation. Thompson said in the subpoena letter to Twitter that the select committee was interested in obtaining key documents House investigators suspect the company is withholding that could shed light on how users used the platform to plan and execute the Capitol attack. The chairman said the select committee was interested in records from Reddit, since the “r/The_Donald” subreddit that eventually migrated to a website of the same name hosted significant discussion and planning related to the Capitol attack. Thompson said House investigators were seeking materials from Alphabet, the parent company of YouTube, which was a platform for significant communications by its users who played key roles in the Capitol attack. The select committee has been examining digital fingerprints left by the Trump White House and other individuals connected to the Capitol attack since the outset of the investigation, on everything from posts that show geolocations to metadata, the source said. To that end, the select committee issued data preservation requests to 35 telecom and social media companies in August, demanding that they save the materials in the event the panel’s technical team required their release, the source said. The Guardian first reported that month that the select committee, among other individuals, had requested the telecom and social media firms preserve the records of the former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in addition to a dozen House Republicans. The select committee gave the social media companies a 27 January deadline to comply with the subpoenas, but it was not clear whether the organizations would comply. A spokesperson for Twitter and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Congressman Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House minority leader who refused a request for cooperation late on Wednesday by the select committee, has previously threatened telecom and social media companies if they comply with the bipartisan panel’s investigation. “If these companies comply with the Democrat order to turn over private information, they are in violation of federal law,” McCarthy said at the time in August. “A Republican majority will not forget and will stand with Americans to hold them fully accountable under the law.”",News/US news,"Capitol attack panel subpoenas Google, Facebook and Twitter for digital records",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/13/capitol-attack-subpoenas-google-facebook-twitter-reddit-january-6
1/14/2022,"The stripping of Prince Andrew’s military roles and royal patronages marks a nadir for the Queen’s second son, since sexual assault accusations arose amid concern over his relationship with the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. It’s a fall from grace for the 61-year-old, who was once second-in-line to the throne.  Prince Andrew is born at Buckingham Palace, becoming the first child born to a reigning monarch since Princess Beatrice to Queen Victoria. Andrew joins the Royal Navy as a trainee helicopter pilot. He studies at Dartmouth naval college and completes Royal Marines courses. The prince serves in the Falklands war, after Argentinian forces invade the British overseas territory in the south Atlantic. He served on HMS Invincible as a Sea King helicopter co-pilot. Andrew is promoted to lieutenant, and the Queen makes him her personal aide-de-camp. He serves aboard HMS Brazen as a flight pilot until 1986. Thousands line streets in central London as Andrew marries Sarah Ferguson at Westminster Abbey, and on the same day the Queen makes him Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh. They have two daughters, Princess Beatrice, born in August 1988 and Princess Eugenie, born in March 1990. He and Sarah Ferguson announce they are to separate. Divorce is finalised in May 1996, although the two remain close. Andrew is reportedly introduced to Epstein, an investment banker and financier, through a mutual friend, Ghislaine Maxwell – the daughter of the late media tycoon Robert Maxwell. A photograph that comes to light during Maxwell’s 2021 trial for sex trafficking shows her and Epstein at the Queen’s Balmoral residence that year. Epstein, Maxwell and Andrew are seen at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. Later that year, Epstein and Maxwell attend a joint birthday party at Windsor Castle hosted by the Queen, and the prince throws a shooting weekend for Maxwell’s birthday. According to Virginia Giuffre, Andrew sexually assaults her at Maxwell’s home in Belgravia, London and also twice more, at Epstein’s New York home and at an “orgy” on his private island in the Caribbean when she was 17. The allegation has prompted a comprehensive denial from the Duke of York. Andrew retires from the Royal Navy as commander. He was later given a promotion to rear admiral in 2010 and vice admiral in 2015. The government appoints him as special representative for international trade and investment. He represents the UK at trade fairs and conferences around the world. The prince visits Epstein in New York, after his release from prison for pleading guilty to prostituting minors. They are photographed walking through Central Park. Sarah Ferguson is filmed by a tabloid reporter claiming the prince would meet a donor and pass on business contacts if she received £500,000. Andrew quits his trade envoy role after a furore about him visiting Epstein in New York after he had been jailed for sexual offences. Ferguson also admits accepting money from Epstein to pay off debts. Allegations that Andrew had sex with Giuffre emerge in court documents in Florida related to Epstein. They say she was forced to have sex with him when she was 17, which is under the age of consent under Florida law. Buckingham Palace denies the allegations. Epstein is found dead in his jail cell after being re-arrested and charged with sex trafficking. Andrew steps back from public duties “for the foreseeable future” after a disastrous BBC TV interview where he claims he could not have had sex with Giuffre because he was at home after a visit to Pizza Express in Woking, that her description of his dancing with her beforehand could not be true because he was unable to sweat and that he had “no recollection of ever meeting this lady”. A New York judge rejects the prince’s attempts to throw out a sexual abuse civil lawsuit brought against him by Giuffre. The Queen strips her son of a range of military affiliations and royal patronages after more than 150 veterans write to describe their “upset and anger”.",News/UK news,The fall of Prince Andrew – a timeline,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/prince-andrew-a-timeline

1/14/2022,"Internal inquiries rarely force the resignation of a sitting prime minister, but the veteran civil servant conducting the one into Downing Street parties has previously helped end the careers of several cabinet ministers. And with all eyes in Westminster now on Sue Gray’s inquiry, her previous investigations offer clues to how she goes about her business – and they will not give Boris Johnson much comfort.  Among the scalps claimed by Gray are those of Damian Green, Liam Fox, Andrew Mitchell and Hazel Blears. Her inquiry into Green showed her to be an uncompromising operator. This time she is not investigating a minister at the centre of a high-profile scandal and then passing on her findings to the cabinet secretary and the prime minister. At the behest of Johnson, she is establishing facts that will later be examined by the public and Tory MPs as they decide the future of the government. Gray has returned to work with the propriety and ethics team in the Cabinet Office – the unit set up to examine the integrity of ministers and officials – that she left in 2018. Previously, in 2017, she was invited to investigate Damian Green, the first secretary of state and de facto deputy to Theresa May. Gray examined two allegations that Green had broken the ministerial code. One was an allegation of inappropriate behaviour – an unwanted sexual advance – towards the journalist Kate Maltby, followed by an inappropriate text message. A second claim, that during a 2008 inquiry into leaks pornographic material was found on Green’s parliamentary computer, resulted in Green’s arrest. Maltby told the Cabinet Office inquiry that the MP touched her knee and appeared to solicit sex from her in exchange for political mentoring. After interviewing both parties, Gray released a damning 500-word summary of the inquiry, which examined the “competing and contradictory accounts” of Green and Maltby. It concluded: “It was not possible to reach a definitive conclusion on the appropriateness of Mr Green’s behaviour with Kate Maltby in early 2015, though the investigation found Ms Maltby’s account to be plausible.” Sources have told the Guardian that Gray insisted the word “plausible” should be included in the report – a phrase that was seized upon by Green’s critics. The findings concluded Green had also released two misleading statements, which had suggested he was not aware that indecent material was found on parliamentary computers in his office, even though the Metropolitan police had previously informed him of the existence of this material. Green, the former first secretary of state and widely seen as May’s closest friend in government, has said he accepted his dismissal because he was misleading in a statement about a police investigation into pornography found on his office computer. Gray’s report into Green, and the summary of the report, were handed to the then cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, who shared them with the PM’s independent adviser on ministerial interests, who was then Sir Alex Allan. It remains unclear whether Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, will have any role in the current inquiry into drinks parties. He was initially appointed to lead the inquiry but was forced to step down after it emerged that his office had held one itself during lockdown. Critics have called for Johnson to recuse himself of his role overseeing the drinks party inquiry. If Gray suggests that there may have been a breach of the ministerial code by Johnson, he will then have to rule on whether to refer himself to Lord Geidt, the current independent adviser on ministerial interests. Gray, 64, is married to Bill Conlon, a County Down-based country and western singer, and left her job in propriety and ethics to take up a senior role in the Northern Irish civil service. She returned to England in April last year as second permanent secretary in the Cabinet Office with responsibility for the union, then moved with Michael Gove to his new Department for Levelling Up after the reshuffle last September.",News/Politics,Sue Gray: head of No 10 party inquiry is an uncompromising operator,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/13/sue-gray-head-of-no-10-party-inquiry-is-an-uncompromising-operator
1/14/2022,"When the announcement of Prince Andrew’s sudden royal demotion came at a few minutes past 5pm on Thursday, the level of its brutality didn’t take long to sink in for people who know how the royal family works. “I don’t know what the richter scale goes up to but this is a big earthquake,” one source told the Guardian. “This feels to me like a straightforward ejection or excommunication. This is the most serious step they could have taken.”  Gone were the Duke of York’s military affiliations – ranging from being colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment to colonel of the Grenadier Guards. And gone were his royal patronages – including a characteristically large numbers of golf clubs, but also good causes such as the SickKids Foundation and the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust. He will retain his military rank of Vice Admiral and remains in the line of succession to the throne. And then it was reported, via a royal source quoted by the Press Association, that Andrew will no longer use the style “His Royal Highness” in any official capacity “Losing the HRH style would be the most emotionally damaging because he was born a royal highness,” the source said. It means Andrew joins the divorcees Diana, Princess of Wales and his own ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, in losing the use of the styling. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex also had their HRH monikers put into abeyance when they stopped working for the royal family, but, said Dr Ed Owens, royal historian, “they had a choice” about their decision to end their life as working royals. “We know he has been trying to cling onto the last semblance of respectability in public life and keeping himself present,” Dr Owens said. “It now looks like that has backfired.” The Buckingham Palace statement was terse, but devastating and left readers in no doubt about where authority lay. “With The Queen’s approval and agreement, The Duke of York’s military affiliations and Royal patronages have been returned to The Queen,” it said. “The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.” There was no need to increase the reputational damage to the British monarchy with any mention of Andrew’s former friends Jeffrey Esptein and Ghislaine Maxwell, respectively a convicted paedophile and a convicted sex trafficker. Neither did the palace mention that the case it alluded to was being brought in a US civil court by Virginia Roberts Giuffre who claims she was trafficked by Epstein to have sex with powerful people, including Andrew, when she was 17. Andrew has consistently denied her allegations. The seismic blow to Andrew’s status came as his team were still reeling from the fallout of the New York Court decision to reject his attempt to stop Giuffre’s case in its tracks. A source close to Andrew said: “Given the robustness with which Judge Kaplan greeted our arguments, we are unsurprised by the ruling. However, it was not a judgment on the merits of Ms Giuffre’s allegations. This is a marathon not a sprint and the duke will continue to defend himself against these claims.” David McClure, the author of the Queen’s True Worth, said the Queen’s decision was “a sensible and indeed inevitable move to restrict any further damage he might do in the future”. “It is overdue and in some ways it should have been done earlier,” McClure said. “Some damage has already been done but there is the possibility of more to come. Even if he is cleared in the court, his reputation is finished and he has done damage to the royal family because of his association with Epstein and Maxwell.” The decision to take back the duke’s military affiliations and royal patronages had been widely discussed among senior members of the royal family, including with the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge. The duke’s roles have been handed back to the Queen with immediate effect for redistribution to other members of the royal family. Sources stressed that they will not be returned to Andrew. Such a series of steps to strip Prince Andrew of his status, would probably have been hard for the Queen, who is often described as having had a very strong bond with her second-eldest son. “I think for the Queen to be forced down this route would be devastating for him and for her,” one royal source said. “The military patronages will be heart-breaking for him and it was all he had left. His outstanding achievement in his working life was limited to his military career and what he did in the Falklands.” “This has come more swiftly and is more brutal than I expected,” they added. It was more brutal than the fate of Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, as the semi-divorce from the Royal household was partly of their making, the source said. Key outstanding questions include whether Andrew will retain financial support from the royal family and his home in the grounds of Windsor castle. “It is absolutely right that Andrew has now returned his military titles to the Queen,” said royal author and former government minister Norman Baker. “It had become an embarrassment all round, not least for the military, for him to continue for example to be colonel-in-chief of the Grenadier Guards. “The fact that the Palace is now describing him as a private citizen in respect of his court case tells us he has well and truly been chucked under the royal bus, yet the royal family cannot escape the immense damage that will increase as the American court case progresses. Can he now even stay as Duke of York, or having been marched up that hill by the Queen, will he be marched down again?”",News/UK news,‘Chucked under royal bus’: Prince Andrew’s demotion shows institution’s ruthlessness,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/chucked-under-royal-bus-prince-andrews-demotion-shows-institutions-ruthlessness
1/14/2022,"A day after dismissing the need for more restrictive measures to combat the coronavirus, the premier in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan has tested positive for Covid-19. “I’m feeling fine, but will be self-isolating and working from home for the next five days,” wrote Scott Moe on Twitter, alongside an image of a positive antigen test.  The news came just a day after the province announced it has no plans to restrict gatherings even while the highly-transmissible Omicron variant continues its rapid spread. “I don’t know that those are working in any other province across Canada,” Moe told reporters. “We’re seeing numbers continuing to spread in areas that have restrictions in place that go far beyond gathering limits.” Unlike in many other provinces, larger events like conferences and hockey tournaments are still permitted in Saskatchewan, which is also the only region not to delay the return to in-person learning. Moe’s office said his last negative test result was Sunday night. The premier has since attended a number of events and was photographed with his mask hanging under his chin. He also repeatedly took his mask off to answer questions during Wednesday’s press conference. Dr Saqib Shahab, the province’s chief medical health officer who was seated beside Moe at the press conference, remained masked at all times. Shahab had previously warned that residents should refrain from gathering and socializing indoors. “One single ill-planned and not recommended event can result in thousands of cases, which once they impact people who are unvaccinated, older, frail, immunocompromised will lead to hospitalizations,” he said. But provinces with conservative governments, like Saskatchewan, have been wary of imposing new lockdown restrictions, instead ramping up rapid testing. Most other provinces have taken steps to limit the spread of Omicron as it overwhelms healthcare systems. British Columbia has limited sports events, Ontario has shut down bars and indoor dining and Quebec has implemented an evening curfew. Quebec has also announced plans to tax residents who choose to remain unvaccinated. But even in highly vaccinated regions of the country, the healthcare system has been put under extreme pressure.
