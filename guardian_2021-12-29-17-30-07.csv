12/29/2021,"People testing positive to Covid using rapid antigen tests are being turned away from, or are giving up on, getting a PCR test, as the New South Wales government warns that the actual number of Covid cases could be much higher than the 11,201 reported on Wednesday. Wait times for testing clinics have ballooned across NSW, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia.  Guardian Australia has spoken to people who have developed Covid symptoms after being in contact with a confirmed positive case, or who have a positive rapid antigen test, who have been trying for several days to get a PCR test but have been turned away. Others were tested before Christmas but are still waiting on their result. Long queues result in wait times of several hours. Some people had been turned away half an hour after a testing site opened because it was over capacity. At others people camped out overnight to ensure they were at the top of the queue. Amy McNeilage and her mother both tested positive on a rapid antigen test earlier this week and were finally able to get a PCR test on Wednesday, after driving an hour from north-west Sydney to Lithgow. McNeilage’s mother was turned away from three testing sites on Tuesday – Castle Hill, Rouse Hill and Penrith. They checked the NSW Health website and saw that Hawkesbury showgrounds would be open from 8am, so got up early and joined the queue at 6.15am. The website later marked it as closed. McNeilage and her partner need official confirmation from a PCR test in order to return to their home in Canberra, and to show their employers why they need time off work. They will quarantine in Sydney until cleared to travel. “I just feel incredibly grateful that I am vaccinated because I have been quite unwell, more unwell than I expected to be with being double vaccinated,” McNeilage says. “I hate to think what sort of shape I would be in if I had not been vaccinated.” Officials in three states – Victoria, South Australia and NSW – have said testing capacity should be reserved for people who have symptoms or have returned a positive rapid antigen test (RAT). The NSW government has blamed the surging testing queues on “tourism testing,” mainly people travelling to Queensland who are required to show a negative PCR test. NSW Health sent texts to people who completed a PCR on Wednesday warning that the wait for results would be 72 hours. In a statement, it said it was taking steps to “limit testing that is not clinically urgent”, prioritising people who have Covid symptoms or a positive rapid antigen test, are a household contact, or have been in a high transmission venue. Karen Lang spent Christmas at home with her partner, her adult son and daughter, and her daughter’s boyfriend, suffering from severe flu-like symptoms from what she assumes is Covid. Her son was identified as a close contact and began to feel unwell on 19 December. He tested positive on 20 December, Lang and her daughter tested negative. Lang and her daughter then began to feel unwell, so they went to get tested again on 23 December. They still have not received a result. Lang’s partner, who got tested on 24 December, also has not received a result. Her daughter’s boyfriend, who also tested on the 24th, received a negative test result back five days later. Lang and her partner are booked to have their booster shots next week, but don’t know whether to keep the booking. If they have had Covid, they should not get the shot for another six months. But if their long-delayed PCR test comes back negative, they should get the shot. “So what do we do?” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Some, like Michael Banford, returned a positive rapid antigen test, looked at the queues for PCR tests, and decided not to get tested at all. Banford began to feel slightly off early last week, and returned two positive rapid antigen tests. It’s now 10 days since his symptoms first appeared and the 53-year-old, who was double vaccinated with AstraZeneca, said he was feeling better. He will take a few more rapid antigen tests before leaving isolation. The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said that people who are just seeking a screening test should use a rapid antigen test not a PCR test, but that people who test positive on a rapid antigen test, or who have symptoms, should still get a PCR test. She went on to say the very high rate of positive test results – currently above 5% – meant the testing clinics were “probably not getting to all of the cases”. “So there is probably more disease in the community than the numbers reflect.” The testing queues are slightly shorter in Victoria, with the average result time hovering around two days. Laura Strehlau has taken her family for five PCR tests since 17 December, when her eight-year-old son was identified as a close contact. He tested positive, followed by her six-year-old, and then, yesterday, her four-year-old. So far, Strehlau herself has not tested positive. The longest they have waited for a test result is five days, the shortest eight hours – from a small testing clinic at Healesville. They have also been screening with rapid antigen tests, but Strehlau says expecting people to rely on the increasingly expensive tests was unfair. “I am a single mum, I have had to go into my savings to buy them,” she says. “They are hard to get and they are expensive, it’s the toilet paper of 2021.”",News/Australia news,Long queues and closed clinics: Australians with positive rapid antigen tests abandon PCRs,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/29/long-queues-and-closed-clinics-australians-with-positive-rapid-antigen-tests-abandon-pcrs
12/29/2021,"Two years ago, our consumer electronics reviews added a new criteria to be judged – how sustainable the latest device, laptop or tablet is. So have the tech giants made any progress? In some way, yes. But there is a long way to go. More mainstream products now contain recycled material as major tech firms follow through with their sustainability pledges. For example, Apple’s full iPad line and the majority of its computers are now made of recycled aluminium, as are Google’s latest Pixel 6 smartphones. Most of Amazon’s own-brand devices contain recycled plastic, including the Fire HD 10 tablets and Echo devices, as do Microsoft’s Ocean Plastic Mouse and Logitech’s MX Keys Mini keyboard.  Most major technology firms offer device recycling, too, even if it is through third-parties and often only when you buy something new. Much more is needed if we are to reach a circular economy, including better recycling. Much of the progress has been brought about by a combination of consumer awareness and investor pressure. Real change can happen in a consumer industry if people vote with their wallets. Access to information on what goes into making a device, the length of software support and the repair options, is still limited but getting better for some things. Some of the biggest companies, including Apple, Microsoft and Google, publish environmental impact assessments, but not for all products and often with limited scope. Keeping your device rather than needing to buy a new one is better for the planet and your wallet. Progress has been made on this front, too. One of the biggest issues affecting the longevity of smartphones is the premature expiry of software support. The ending of crucial security updates renders perfectly serviceable devices unsafe to use. It is still very much a problem, with some companies offering as little as two to three years of updates from a device’s release, including big firms such as Oppo, particularly for cheaper models. But with Samsung extending updates to at least four years for a range of phones, not only high-end models, and Google promising at least five years for its Pixel 6 phones, others are finally starting to catch up with Apple’s five to seven years of updates for its iPhones. The repairability of consumer electronics is slowly improving too. Dutch firm Fairphone continues to set the standard with its latest modular phone that can be repaired at home with just a simple screwdriver, is made from ethically sourced and recycled materials, and will have six to seven years of software support. US startup Framework is trying something similar with modular, repairable laptops. Now others are taking notice. Following pressure from the public and shareholders, Apple and Microsoft have recently expanded their efforts to make parts and tools for repairs available to the public. “We are starting to see the pendulum swing in the right direction,” says Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of the repair specialists iFixit. “We’ve seen shifts from major manufacturers, such as Microsoft redesigning the Surface Laptop to make it easier to repair, jumping from a one to a five in our scoring system. But others, including Samsung, appear to have done very little, so we still have a long way to go.” However, where the big tech firms are starting to tread, the cheaper end of the market is not yet following. “Inexpensive, disposable products are a real problem,” Wiens says. Even where products are designed to be robust enough to last, many of the smaller devices such as headphones and wearable technology are difficult to fix and contain irreplaceable batteries that wear out, giving them a finite lifespan. “There’s such a fantastic opportunity for large brands to step up and make their products long-lasting. The resale value is the real test of a product’s impact on the market,” Wiens says. The good news is that access to good, reconditioned secondhand devices is getting better, which, coupled with easier repairs and extended software support, keeps devices out of the recycling for longer. But for devices to be available for a second or third hand, they have to be bought new first, which is why we will continue to thoroughly review devices to help you choose from the best available.",News/Technology,Guardian tech reviews: small sustainability steps but lots more to do,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/29/guardian-tech-reviews-small-sustainability-steps-but-lots-more-to-do
12/29/2021,"Professional football in the New York metropolitan area somehow has become even bleaker in the two-plus years that have passed since the Giants and Jets last played each other. The Jets (2-7) rallied to beat the Giants (2-8) that glum November day in the Meadowlands in the so-called Toilet Bowl, with tailgaters displaying toilet-seat lids with each team’s logo. The NFL’s two NYC-based teams are each 4-11 heading into the homestretch of the 2021 season. It is likely that both will finish the season with 13 losses, which has never happened since New York added an AFL team in 1960. In the last 10 years, only the 2016 Giants reached the playoffs (and they were promptly blown out by Green Bay in the wild-card round). More recently, they have been pro football’s biggest losers: none of the other 30 teams in the NFL have posted a worse record than the Jets (21-58) or Giants (22-57) since 2016.  There have been other barren stretches in the city’s football history: the Giants and Jets went through the entire 1970s with neither team making the postseason. The 1977 season ended with the Giants (5-9) losing in the snow and rain at home to Chicago, 12-9, and the Jets (3-11 for the third straight year) falling at Philadelphia, 27-0, before just 19,241 fans. This drought, like the Toilet Bowl, is a shared misery around the metro area. Because the Jets and Giants play in different conferences and don’t face each other as often as the Rangers and Islanders in hockey or Knicks or Nets in basketball, there is less rancor between the local supporters. Baseball fans in New York are more likely to pick a side, either the Yankees or Mets, than football fans. The NFL has, and will, survive with two lousy teams in the nation’s No 1 television market, and it is possible that one team, if not both at the same time, will be good again someday. But what has unfolded this season in New York makes a turnaround for either team look like a long-term project, with brighter days not exactly around the corner. “How is it that the greatest city in the world has the two worst football teams? New York deserves better than the slop the Giants and Jets have been serving up for most of the last decade,” Gary Myers, the author and former long-time NFL columnist for the New York Daily News, tells the Guardian. “The really bad news: There is no end in sight. The NFL promotes parity but somehow the Giants and Jets, despite consistently high draft picks, have combined for only one playoff appearance in the last 10 years. “That 11-5 season by the Giants in 2016 was an aberration,” Myers adds. “They fired their coach Ben McAdoo, who was still learning on the job, in just his second year, 12 games into the following season. The Jets hope they finally got it right with GM Joe Douglas, coach Robert Saleh and rookie quarterback Zach Wilson. The Jets are due for some success. It’s been over 50 years since their one and only Super Bowl season. This will be a huge offseason for each team, but I don’t think any ticker-tape parades are imminent.” Consider, just for starters, what happened on Sunday to the Jets. They held on to beat Jacksonville (2-13) at home, 26-21, but the Jaguars rolled to the Jets’ one-yard line with 12 seconds to play. Only the incompetence of the Jaguars saved the hosts, because Jacksonville, clearly confused, was called for an illegal shift before a hurried incompletion. “Good teams win those games,” said Trevor Lawrence, Jacksonville’s rookie quarterback. Had the Jags scored a touchdown, the Jets would have dipped below Jacksonville in the NFL’s race for the worst record, because of the head-to-head loss. With Tampa Bay and Buffalo to play, the Jets could have sunk below the team that would have had the worst record, Detroit (2-12-1), who finish up with the crumbling Seahawks and the might-be-resting Packers. The Jets have not had the No 1 overall pick since 1996, just before they would win only one of 16 games under the overmatched Rich Kotite. (The Giants, 6-10, were not all that much better, and Dan Reeves was fired as their coach.) At least the Jets ran off six non-losing seasons after that, and the Giants made it to Super Bowl XXXV in January 2001. The historically poor run of form for both teams has turned up the heat on Giants general manager Dave Gettleman and, to a slightly lesser extent, Jets GM Joe Douglas. The Jets do have Wilson and the intense Saleh, who says stuff like, “The guys played their absolute butts off.” The Giants just have problems. With ESPN reporting over the weekend, citing sources, that they plan to bring back second-year head coach Joe Judge and third-year quarterback Daniel Jones in 2022, speculation is well underway as to who might replace Gettleman, whose biggest gambit as GM appears to have bombed. Nearly four years have passed since Gettleman traded up to the No 2 position in the draft to select Saquon Barkley, the dynamic running back from Penn State, rather than a quarterback to eventually replace the fading veteran Eli Manning. Barkley had a terrific rookie season and a solid second year but tore up his knee in the second game of the 2020 season. This season has been a slog for Barkley, who missed four games with a bad-looking ankle injury, and he sure looks as if he has lost a step. The Giants were trailing Philadelphia in the third quarter on Sunday by only 10-3 when Barkley took a handoff and motored upfield – only to be caught from behind after a five-yard gain by Eagles linebacker Genard Avery. Barkley had only one more carry, for no gain, in a 34-10 loss, before Judge took him out, citing the pounding that Barkley has taken this season. Moreover, Barkley was not made available to the media either after the game or on Monday, leading to speculation that he might be shut down for the season – like Jones, who has a neck injury that has not gone away. “In terms of shutting him down for the year, that’s more something that our medical team has not approached me about,” Judge said of Barkley. It would probably be fine with the fans if both teams just shut it down for the year and start over. Once again, like the city itself, it is the renovation project without end.",Sport/Sport,And just like that: How New York City became the laughing stock of the NFL,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/29/new-york-giants-jets-football-worst-futility
12/29/2021,"The UK’s first specialist black bookshop is to close after more than 55 years due to financial problems, it has been announced. New Beacon Books in Finsbury Park, north London, first opened in 1966 and staved off the threat of closure as recently as 2016.  But with financial pressures exacerbated by coronavirus adding to the competition from online retailers such as Amazon, it has been confirmed the store will close its physical outlet on Stroud Green Road and move online only. Creating a space for black writers, New Beacon Books was founded by the activist John La Rose and his partner, Sarah White. Speaking about the prospect of the UK’s first black publisher and specialist bookshop closing, Prof Augustine John, chair of the Communities Empowerment Network (CEN) charity, said it was “at the heart of the community” and should be saved. “New Beacon Books is the only remaining independent black publishing and bookselling entity in the UK,” he said. “Throughout its 55 years, it has been pivotal to the growth of the Black Education Movement, the Black Supplementary School Movement and current calls for the decolonisation of the curriculum. “Unlike Amazon, Alibris and other online suppliers, New Beacon has been at the heart of communities, building social movements and giving expression to young voices.” Prof John, an award-winning Grenadian writer, added: “It remains a huge part of the history of the adaptation of British society to its historical black presence. Save and develop it for coming generations.” The announcement of the store’s closure, posted on its website earlier this month, has been met with dismay and disappointment on social media. The actor Adjoa Andoh tweeted: “I am so sad about this wonderful bookshop and the haven of cultural solidarity and information it provided to the black and extended communities for over half a century.” Another social media user, Elliot Ross, commented: “How have we in the UK made this a time of unprecedented ‘visibility’ for works by Black authors, while at the same time producing the conditions in which a radical bulwark like New Beacon Books can’t sustain itself after half a century of vital work?” Emeka Forbes tweeted: “Much of what I know about anti-racism, I found between the pages of books purchased at New Beacon when I lived in Finsbury Park.” There have been calls for crowdfunding campaigns to help save the shop, with the actor and poet Francesca Gilbert tweeting that there will be an update “in a few days”. The shop’s director, Michael La Rose, the son of John La Rose who died in 2006, previously told the Guardian that a “sustained movement” was needed to ensure the longevity of specialist black bookshops. He said last year: “The consciousness-raising of the global [Black Lives Matter] movement has made every country question what is going on in their societies – people want to know what has happened in the past, to get books, to get information, to get facts.”",Arts/Books,Dismay as UK’s first specialist black bookshop forced to close,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/29/uk-first-specialist-black-bookshop-shut-new-beacon-dismay
12/29/2021,"Australia’s peak doctors’ body has revealed that it had warned governments to secure rapid antigen tests when they began planning to open up the country, after Scott Morrison described the scarce screening tool as a “precious commodity”. With fresh claims that the long-standing PCR testing system was “crumbling” as the country recorded more than 18,000 daily Covid cases for the first time, Australians were lining up at pharmacies to try to buy rapid antigen tests (RATs).  Some state governments on Wednesday accused the federal government of not “stepping up” to “fill the gap” by failing to procure more supplies of the vital screening tool, while Morrison called a snap national cabinet meeting for Thursday to discuss the sharp rise in cases fuelled by the Omicron variant. Dr Chris Moy, the vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, said the community needed access to RATs and clear, simple instructions about when to use them. “At the moment we have neither,” he said on Wednesday. That was despite earlier warnings from the AMA. Moy said when governments began planning to open up, the organisation “asked and advocated for a clear plan to ensure access for RATs and clear policies for their use, for this very time which was predicted”. Moy said Australia now faced a critical time as people were struggling to access RATs and the long-standing PCR testing system was “crumbling”. Small businesses have said many have had to close during the summer holiday period because of the failure of state and federal governments to bring in free RATs. Morrison addressed reporters in Sydney on Wednesday – the first time the prime minister had held a press conference in a week – and insisted the federal government was “meeting our responsibilities”. He said he welcomed announcements by the New South Wales and Victorian governments to procure RATs, saying pointedly: “That’s their job, and I’m glad they’re doing it. “Where a RAT test would now be required rather than a PCR test, state governments, as always, responsible for securing those RAT tests, providing them to people directly, and we will share the costs of those 50-50 with the state government,” the prime minister said. Morrison said the federal government was responsible for tests in residential aged care facilities and certain other high-risk settings. He said the federal government had been “in the market” for RATs since August, with four million tests already delivered, and “another six million arriving very soon”. Morrison said he had also allocated an extra $375m “to procure further RAT tests to be part of the national stockpile”, to be mainly used to cover the federal government’s responsibilities for directly providing tests. The federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, went on the attack, saying Morrison was presiding over a testing “crisis” and was “once again showing a lack of leadership, consistently passing the buck to state and territory governments”. “Everything that he does is characterised by being too little, too late,” Albanese said. Citing Morrison’s past comments about the vaccine rollout not being a race, Albanese added: “Now he says with the rapid antigen tests, that not only is it not a race, they’re not even on the field at all. They are leaving it completely to the states.” Labor’s health spokesperson, Mark Butler, said RATs were “widespread and readily available and highly affordable” in other countries, but pharmacists in Australia were reporting shortages. Butler urged Morrison to “urgently secure a large stockpile of rapid tests that can be used by businesses and members of the Australian community right now”. “Yet again Scott Morrison has left Australians dangerously exposed and at the back of the queue,” Butler said. The Victorian government announced on Wednesday it had secured 34m RATs, to be handed out for free by the end of January. The state’s health minister, Martin Foley, said Victoria “would much prefer to have a national approach to what is the national indeed and international supply issue”. “But failing that, as per usual, the states have had to step up over the course of this pandemic and fill the gap that’s been left,” Foley said.

A further order of 30m was announced on Wednesday. The federal health department said the government had purchased more than 10m RATs for use in residential aged care facilities, and it would “shortly” purchase a further 50m for the national medical stockpile. A spokesperson for the department said more than 2.8m RATs had so far been supplied to aged care facilities, including 1,650,014 tests to NSW facilities and 1,284,341 to Victorian facilities, the states where the majority of transmission has occurred. Australia reported more than 18,200 new Covid cases on Wednesday – a new record for the country – including 11,201 in NSW, 3,767 in Victoria, 1,539 cases in Queensland and 1,471 in South Australia. Morrison will return from Sydney to Canberra for a meeting with state and territory leaders on Thursday. National cabinet had not been scheduled to meet until next week. Morrison said the country was “going through a gear change” in its approach to Covid. He said with the Omicron variant, the issue was not the “high volume of cases”, but the incidence of serious disease and impacts on the hospital system. He said there were currently 1,314 people in hospital, including 126 in intensive care and 55 on ventilators – suggesting there was “ample capacity in our hospital system to deal with the challenges that we are presently confronting”. Morrison said Thursday’s national cabinet meeting would discuss a federal government proposal to narrow the definition of a close contact: someone who lives with a confirmed Covid case “and has spent more than four hours with them”. The proposed definition will also include people living alongside confirmed cases in care settings. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) said just before Christmas that health authorities should consider “more widespread use” of rapid antigen testing. “This may lead to a requirement in the future to rely more heavily on other levers, including indoor mask wearing and strategic use of rapid antigen testing, to control transmission and impacts, particularly in high-risk settings,” the AHPPC said on 22 December.",News/Australia news,Doctors reveal they warned Australia’s governments to secure rapid antigen tests ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/29/doctors-reveal-they-warned-australias-governments-to-secure-rapid-antigen-tests
12/29/2021,"In the final section of Hanya Yanagihara’s tripartite novel, there is an episode that functions as a compressed emblem of the book’s intricately assembled themes and intensely anxious preoccupations. Having already been immersed in narratives set in the 19th and 20th centuries, the reader is now taken far into the 21st, an era in which pandemics sweep the globe in waves, each time altering the civic and political order. As a new virus threatens to take hold, a mother isolates her twin sons, survivors of an earlier sickness that has left them so immuno-compromised they can never again leave the house. After she herself succumbs, and they run out of food, they venture outside, and die. The scientist who discovers their bodies wonders why they didn’t call for help, hypothesising that perhaps it was “because they wanted to see the world. I imagined them joining hands and walking out the door, down the steps, and into their backyard. There they’d stand, holding each other’s hands, smelling the air, and looking up at the treetops all around them, their mouths opening in wonder, their lives becoming glorious – for once – even as they ended.”  There are few surface resemblances between A Little Life, Yanagihara’s Booker-shortlisted second novel, and To Paradise, but in both she is deeply, compulsively interested in characters for whom the world seems unattainable, whose histories and temperaments coalesce to render them marginal, held back. Where A Little Life’s Jude St Francis was never able to find release from the relentless abuse he suffered as a child without attempting to wound and destroy himself, the characters in To Paradise are often afflicted by a diffidence more nebulous in origin, a hesitancy powered by an obscure sense of unbelonging or incapacity. Those characters are various in their circumstances and behaviour, although Yanagihara’s device of using the same group of names in each of the three parts suggests a form of figurative, if not literal, reincarnation; as if the perseveration of psychological and emotional difficulty were, like a resurgent virus, resistant to attempts to subdue or eradicate it. But these personal stories are not simply studies in interiority; indeed, unlike the striking atemporality of A Little Life, each section conjures a vivid, often startlingly reconfigured America. The opening section, Washington Square, immediately brings to mind the fictional world of Henry James and Edith Wharton, as well as more prosaically allowing Yanagihara to lay the ground for the fact that a single house will stand at the centre of the novel. Here we encounter David Bingham, the first born of a trio of siblings whose care, following their parents’ death, has fallen to their wealthy grandfather, Nathaniel. But amid the refinement and delicacy of the household – “even the sole had been steamed so expertly that you needed only to scoop it with the spoon held out for you, the bones yielding to the silver’s gentlest nudge” – there are darknesses and silence, not least concerning David’s “confinements”, peculiar periods of illness responsive only to retreat from the world. Another pressing matter is David’s marriage, or lack of it; Nathaniel must ensure that his numerous properties and the family business will have a steward for the future. And here comes one of the earliest moments of wrongfooting; it is 1893, and in New York at the heart of the “Free States” of America, same-sex marriage is not merely legal, but commonplace. Suddenly, we are forced into an alternative history that imagines the past not as an earlier point on a progressive spectrum, but an era far more egalitarian and conducive to love, despite its class barriers and rigid etiquettes. That Yanagihara is set on disrupting our ideas of a journey towards enlightenment becomes clearer when the second section recreates Manhattan in the stigmatic age of Aids, here known only as “the disease”, and the third in a society where virulent illness has ushered in totalitarianism – which, as we might imagine, is thoroughly opposed to freedoms pertaining to love and sexuality. In some ways, this is a work whose fascination with entropy – the breakdown of societies, of property, of the body – makes its job almost impossibly hard; we feel as though we are standing in the centre of ever-decreasing circles. The middle section, in which a group of wealthy, well-connected gay men are pictured in the midst of a lengthy party to take their leave of a friend, a man relieved to have “only” terminal cancer who is taking control of his death, shows us a community closing ranks. A shadow plot reveals the damage inflicted on a family via the American colonisation of Hawaii, and includes perhaps the book’s most deeply affecting section, a near-Nabokovian exploration of mental disintegration in the face of dispossession. Here, Yanagihara concentrates the themes of racial oppression and supremacy that are “the sin at America’s heart”. And in the final section, the protagonist – the novel’s only significant female lead – is a young woman whose illness has robbed her of her capacity to feel and communicate emotions, to procreate, to conceive of herself as a person worthy of love. Aware of her predicament, she also lacks the tools and the ability to fully express it (here, one understands Yanagihara’s admiration of Kazuo Ishiguro, a specialist in exploring this kind of double bind). The possibilities in To Paradise always appear to be shrinking, reducing the chances of freedom and self-possession; the central characters, despite often having distinct material or intellectual potential, gradually come to realise the snares that surround them. The novel’s title invokes a feeling of expectant adventuring, of happiness waiting somewhere; what, perhaps, nation-builders might feel just as strongly as individuals at the beginning of their lives. Where the suffering and hopelessness of A Little Life created an overwhelming experience that left readers divided around the issue of how much they could take, this is a far subtler delineation of those who feel hamstrung, beleaguered, inadequate to the task ahead. In many ways – not least the questions of political and social responsibility it poses, especially in the face of global catastrophe – it is a darker work, and yet a more fruitfully puzzling, multifaceted one. And behind this impressive, significant novel stands the question: what is a life, if it is not lived in freedom? To Paradise by Hanya Yanagihara is published by Picador (£20).

12/29/2021,"Mistakes in a Sydney laboratory that led to nearly 1,000 people getting incorrect Covid test results will cause positive cases to ripple through the community, but epidemiologists say Australia’s infection rate is now so high it might not make a significant difference. Over the Christmas period St Vincent’s hospital told 886 people their result was negative, when in fact they were positive.  The hospital’s pathology department, SydPath, has apologised for the “specific human error” that led to the wrong results being delivered. Initially 400 people were sent text messages saying they had a negative result, but were later told they were positive. Another 950 people were told they were negative when the results were not yet known, with 486 of them later told they were positive. “Once again, we are sincerely sorry for this error and acknowledge the significant impact it has had on those involved,” SydPath said in a statement, adding that it had procedures in place to ensure it wouldn’t happen again. Natasha Malani has been told she caught Covid from one of those mistakenly given the all clear, who then travelled to Adelaide and dined at the same restaurant she was in. Malani, the chief executive of the business group South Australian Leaders, said four out of the group of six she dined with were now infected. By the time she knew she was infectious, she had spent Christmas with her family, and had spent time with friends and colleagues. “That person came to Adelaide thinking they were negative … then got a result saying ‘sorry, we made a mistake, it was positive’,” she said. South Australia reported 1,471 new cases on Wednesday, a record for the state. The premier, Steven Marshall, said the Omicron variant was moving “too quickly”, and announced new restrictions on elective surgery and the scrapping of PCR tests for interstate travel due to a lack of capacity. Single events have caused a large number of cases at different times in the pandemic, including many deaths before vaccines became available. More than 850 cases were linked to the Ruby Princess cruise ship after it docked in Sydney and let off 2,700 passengers in March 2020.. But experts say that with daily cases now past the 18,000 mark across Australia, the relative effect of hundreds of people unknowingly spreading Covid is small compared with the early days of the pandemic, even if that is small consolation for the individuals and families affected. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Deakin University’s chair of epidemiology, Prof Catherine Bennett, said the extent to which the error increased the number of cases would depend on how much people were moving around. “It is an unfortunate time of year. Those who did change their behaviour did so because they thought they were cleared – so they went out,” she said. “People were probably getting a test to clear themselves for Christmas. Some of them would have been in isolation anyway, some were in quarantine … “Say a third of them went out and did the family thing, it probably has changed the risk for those families.” But with thousands of positive cases every day, Bennett said, a few hundred wouldn’t make a large overall difference. Mary-Louise McLaws, a University of NSW professor of epidemiology and adviser to the World Health Organization, said it was clear Christmas could be a super-spreader event. “Authorities around the country have heard the potential worst-case scenario from multiple modellers [but] you don’t need models to tell you what could happen,” she said. “It’s not unusual that Christmas is a super-spreader event. “[The SydPath situation] would have the potential of another increase in case numbers. Once you’re given a negative test, at a highly sociable period of the year, they would have gone out immediately … the majority would be young adults going ‘woohoo, I’m negative, I can go and see my friends’.” Michael Lydeamore, a lecturer in Monash University’s econometrics and business statistics department, said the flow-on effect would have made a difference as people travelled in the Christmas period while infectious. But he said with so many cases of community transmission it would not make “as big a difference as people think”. Because authorities were no longer tracking “trees of transmission”, it was unlikely the true effect would ever be revealed.",News/Australia news,"Sydney Covid testing errors to have little effect as Australia’s case numbers soar, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/29/sydney-covid-testing-errors-to-have-little-effect-as-australias-case-numbers-soar-experts-say
