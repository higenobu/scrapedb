3/1/2022,"As the old romantic saying almost goes: if you love something, let stewardship and care of it go – naturally, while retaining possession of all the relevant deeds and liquid assets. The news that Roman Abramovich is apparently giving up day-to-day control of Chelsea to the trustees of the club’s charitable foundation has been interpreted in wildly different ways which, with the benefit of a little reflection, seems to have been the entire point of the exercise. For some it is the ultimate sacrificial act of devotion: Abramovich’s way of insulating the club he adores from the threat of sanction, censure, even seizure. Big surprise: the billionaire oligarch has feelings! For others it is a cynical sleight of hand: the act of very grandiosely doing nothing at all, a solemn legal statement with no legal import whatsoever. For some it is a sign that nothing will be the same again. For others it is a sure sign that Abramovich is intent on ultimately making everything the same again. Certainly if Abramovich had intended to clarify the ownership situation, or whether he intended to sell Chelsea, or what “stewardship and care” actually means in practice, or any of a number of issues currently worrying Chelsea fans, one assumes he would have done so. Be nice if we could ask him, wouldn’t it? You know: take some lateral flows, sit him down for an hour with a few journalists or an audience of Chelsea fans. Pick his brains. Shoot the breeze. But the fact that this mundane scenario feels about as plausible as a page from a fantasy novel is, in many ways, the basic problem, a problem that goes far beyond one partially shaven Russian/Israeli/Portuguese citizen and his company credit card. Why does any owner of an asset as cherished as a local football club get to hide like this, essentially to communicate via smoke signals and the occasional managerial sacking? How, in the world’s most popular sport, did we allow one man – any man – to be simultaneously this powerful and this untouchable? Democratic governments are accountable to their voters. Chief executives are accountable to their shareholders. Who is Abramovich accountable to? The Premier League? Fifa? The only thing we can say with any degree of certainty is that it is not Vladimir Putin. Definitely not Putin. Categorically. We know because a court said so. And so we must conclude that the modern football club owner is essentially a sort of renegade, an independent actor, answerable to nobody but his own theoretical conscience and the siren call of his desire. From Mike Ashley at Newcastle to the Oyston family at Blackpool, to the Glazers at Manchester United to Mel Morris at Derby, the collateral damage caused by bad owners can be a form of trauma for the fans caught up in it. Abramovich, for his part, has been a reasonably popular absentee landlord, hoisting Chelsea from the depths of fourth place in the Premier League in 2003 to third place now, having spent more than £2bn and signed Nemanja Matic twice along the way. Yet even amid the serial rattle of silverware he is yet to answer any of the questions that have been swirling around him for almost two decades. Why football? Why Chelsea? How did you make your money and what exactly do you intend to do with it? And what is it you want here exactly? Of course, we know why these questions remain unanswered. For decades English football, taking its lead from the British state, simply bent the knee to foreign capital, trusted in the innate virtue of wealth to the point where even to query the source of that wealth became an act of sabotage or treachery. Owners became gods, omnipotent and unshiftable, bending the rules and making the rules, fending off any attempt at scrutiny with armies of lawyers and lobbyists, spin and silence. Only now is football beginning to wake up to the stench of its own money, and yet the furious backpedalling of the Johnson government and the performative outrage of the footballing authorities suggests that the real red line was not morality but PR. As ever the only real defence against all of this is organisation and resistance. The only reason Stamford Bridge has been kept out of Abramovich’s hands is through the resilience of the Chelsea Pitch Owners group. Fan solidarity, amplified by social media, helped to strangle the European Super League and belatedly force the government into a review of football governance. But the wider issue here is awareness: a realisation that the fight for sporting representation is really a microcosm of the wider struggle taking place across the board. For all the senseless tragedy unfolding in Ukraine, Russia is not the enemy here. The dissent and protest of its own citizens in the face of a frightening state proves as much. The real faultline is between the powerful and the powerless, the rulers and the ruled. Recognising football’s complicity in war and cruelty also involves recognising that similar corruptions are occurring everywhere one looks. The club you love has been trying to monetise you ever since you first clapped eyes on it. The bodies entrusted with the health of the sport are interested in player welfare, racism and competitive balance only to the extent that it might curdle their bottom line. The company whose services you engaged will do anything to avoid speaking to you on the phone. The government you voted in secretly despises you. Crisis has a habit of sharpening the contours of our world, of filtering out the noise. And up close an alarm bell sounds an awful lot like a million pennies dropping.",Sport/Football,Only now is football beginning to wake up to the stench of its own money | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/01/only-now-is-football-beginning-to-wake-up-to-the-stench-of-its-own-money
3/1/2022,"“Bedding banks” are about to take their place alongside food banks, baby banks and children’s clothes banks as the new face of charity. Parents unable to afford their heating bills are now turning to blankets, sheets, duvet covers and sleeping bags for their children as their cheapest available protection against the cold winter nights. All because, no matter how prudently they budget, families do not have the cash to feed their prepayment gas and electric meters – it is an 18th-century answer despite there being a 21st-century solution.In all my time in politics I have never witnessed so much poverty and hardship. In Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, the constituency I grew up in and represented for 32 years and where I am patron of the local family centre, there are more children than ever going to school ill-clad and hungry; desperate mothers falling into the hands of loan sharks; and mental health problems escalating with little NHS provision to cope. A few weeks ago hundreds of anxious mothers queued up outside their local Co-ops after the family centre staff raised funds to add a £50 credit to their gas and electricity prepayment cards. This is poverty at its demeaning and degrading worst. Even before the April energy price rises, I am hearing stories I thought I would never hear in 2022: of children obsessively checking the electricity meter when they wake up in the bitter cold; of families who can only turn on their heating for two hours a day and use torches at night rather than spending on electric light; and of mothers unable to hide their tears when they cannot provide their children with either winter clothes and shoes or basic warmth. Sadly the welfare state safety net has been torn apart. A few weeks ago a local charity found three children sleeping on the floor under just one blanket. Food banks are now helping a stream of mothers unable to afford cookers to give their children hot food even once a week. They are among the nearly 4 million families who are already behind with their bills. Last week, because of help from Amazon, the Co-op and Scotmid, the Kirkcaldy family centre was able to acquire hundreds of bedding items but now, as they run out again while the need continues to rise, it has sent out direct appeals to established bedding and bedding goods companies for any surplus blankets and bedding. In 1993, during a previous economic crisis, the then government raised VAT and national insurance despite all promises not to do so and millions of people paid the price as family poverty shot up. In the austerity years, benefits were cut – first after 2010 and then more savagely after 2015. But nothing in recent years compares to what’s ahead as simultaneously food costs rise 5%, and gas and electricity prices increase as much as 50%, with benefits subject to only a 3.1% rise even as inflation heads to 7% and the national insurance hike costs the typical family about £20 a month. So with only five weeks to go before the biggest hit to living standards for decades, it’s time to call a halt to the economic madness of allowing, at one and the same time, tax rises, food price hikes, escalating heating bills and real-terms benefit cuts – the quadruple whammy that will tip already hard-pressed families over the edge. It’s time for ministers to wake up to the pain already being felt in places they are unlikely to ever visit, and to the suffering of people they may never see; for no government can justify the further deprivation being imposed on millions of its citizens. Loughborough University’s minimum income standard project, led by Donald Hirsch, has worked out what families need as a baseline income, drawing on research into what the general public considers “essential” expenditures. Last year a couple with two children, aged three and seven, needed £482 a week after paying rent, council tax and childcare. Inflation, Hirsch tells me, has already pushed this up by 6% to £511. Yet come April, benefits for a family like this will rise by only £8 a week – meaning they would have only £274 a week in available income once the contribution to council tax is paid. They have already lost the £20 uplift in universal credit that was cruelly removed last October and, with their income now barely covering half (54%) what they need, they are much worse off than last year. This is why, to ensure their children have food and other essentials, parents often go without necessities themselves. According to the minimum income standard, the full cost of food, gas, electricity, water and home insurance for our family of four is £153 a week, leaving only £4.30 a day per person to cover everything else – from clothes, mobiles and laundry to bedding, toilet rolls and other sanitary goods. When asked, Boris Johnson refused to answer if he could live on universal credit. And no wonder: the weekly personal allowance for couples over 18 would total £121 from April, only a £3.60 rise; and the single person’s rate for those over 25 will be £77 – just a £2.30 rise that will never cover the rising food prices and record heating bills, even after the £200 loan households will have to pay back over the next five years. How can a single woman, looking for work, make ends meet when the mobile phone, broadband and bus fares that she needs for job hunting could each cost about £10 a week and when, like thousands, she has to contribute towards her council tax and rent and repay a loan? Any thought of clothes or even laundry or toiletries is out, and the only way £77 can cover her bills is by cutting back on meals and warmth. This is why, even before its economic statement on 23 March, ministers must – as the Child Poverty Action Group and others have consistently demanded – reverse the £1,000 a year cut in universal credit and do more to help with heating and benefits as well as postponing the national insurance rise. It is often said that true leadership is leading by example. All of us will fall short and Partygate is an especially shameful and painful episode that has distressed millions who made the sacrifices that their leaders were not prepared to make themselves. Povertygate, though, plumbs new depths: leaders are knowingly imposing hardship they will not experience themselves on those already too poor to protect their families. And unlike Partygate, poverty does not end, but goes on day after day, heartbreaking and cruel even beyond austerity. No government should be allowed to get away with it.

3/1/2022,"The jokes about Bob Bradley lasted longer than he did as Swansea City manager. Sky Sports’ Soccer AM ran a sketch for years after the American had departed the Liberty Stadium mocking how he talked about football. Brad Bobley, as the character was dubbed, spoke in a Stateside twang about “scoop-de-loop volleys” and “megnuts” and “midfield stripes”. Bradley’s mistake was once calling a penalty kick a “PK” in a press conference. The jokes made at Bradley’s expense were all good fun, but his chastening experience in Wales highlighted the outdated prejudices still held against American coaches in British football. This is the environment Jesse Marsch has entered as the new manager of Leeds United. Marsch, who worked as an assistant to Bradley for the US national team, arrives at Elland Road having proved himself at a high level on the continent. He was sacked by RB Leipzig only three months ago, but the 48-year-old had built an impressive body of work at Red Bull Salzburg where he won back-to-back league and cup doubles using an energetic, dynamic style of play. Marsch has the makings of a good successor to Marcelo Bielsa. The American has inherited a Leeds squad that should be able to quickly absorb his ideas. Like Bielsa, Marsch favours a ball-orientated, aggressive style that should have fans on the edge of their seats. His teams are renowned for their fluidity and vertical movement. Bielsa-ball will still live on in some form. The biggest change could be the one from a man-marking system to a zonal one but Leeds need a different approach on defence, having conceded more goals (60) than any other side in the Premier League this season. It could be a good fit. And yet the same old tropes Bradley faced more than five years ago are being rolled out again. “You appoint someone called Jesse Marsch who pretty much knows nothing about the Premier League, he’s not worked in it, he’s not plied his trade in it, and you ask him to come in and rescue this team,” said Andy Gray, of former Sky Sports fame now working for beIN Sports, in his blunt assessment of Marsch’s suitability for his new role. Gray never referenced Marsch’s nationality, but the implication was there – how successful can an American coach really be in the Premier League when it isn’t their league or even their sport? Successful or not at Leeds United, Marsch will have to handle such ignorance as only the second American to have managed in the English top flight. American players have largely shaken off the stigma they carried for decades. The likes of Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Gio Reyna and others have encouraged European clubs to consider a previously untapped talent pool more closely. Transfer traffic from the United States to the ‘Big Five’ leagues is heavier than ever before – January saw countless Americans leave MLS for Europe. However, US football is still waiting for a manager to forge a similar path for coaches. Marsch could be that figure, but there were similar hopes for Bradley, who had earned his Premier League opportunity after successful spells in a number of different countries. Of course, Bradley’s short time at Swansea City was catastrophic. He won just two of his 11 matches in charge, his team conceded 29 times in the process and he did nothing to change the course of a club heading for relegation. Unfairly, Bradley’s abject failure made it even harder for an American coach to make a breakthrough in the Premier League. Old prejudices linger – see how Chris Armas has reportedly been nicknamed ‘Ted Lasso’ by Manchester United’s players. Leeds United, however, could be the perfect destination for Marsch despite their current predicament. The Elland Road hierarchy thought outside the box when they appointed Bielsa four years ago and they have done so again by hiring Marsch. It would have been very easy to give Sam Allardyce a call, as many relegation-threatened clubs have over the years. Instead, Leeds have shown more imagination. Ambition, too. It was only last summer that Marsch was deemed a strong enough candidate to take over from Julian Nagelsmann, arguably the best young coach in Europe, at RB Leipzig, a Champions League club with lofty ambitions. In Germany, where Americans have played and coached for years, Marsch’s nationality was barely a factor. He failed at RB Leipzig, but not because he spoke about “PKs”. And not because he’s a bad manager either. Reports at the time of Marsch’s exit from RB Leipzig claimed he had been the victim of a disagreement over philosophy at boardroom level. While the Bundesliga club wanted to play one way, Marsch wanted to play another. The misstep was on RB Leipzig’s part as much as it was on Marsch’s. If Leeds and Marsch are on the same page, their union may just produce results. If results go well, his nationality will be an afterthought in a way Bradley’s never was. Whether he likes it or not, Marsch hasn’t just been charged with turning Leeds United’s season around. The reputation of his US peers is riding on his success too.",Sport/Football,Jesse Marsch must fight US stereotypes as well as relegation at Leeds ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/01/jesse-marsch-leeds-united-manager-football-premier-league

I have slowly realised that I have lost clitoral sensation; while I enjoy a wave of pleasure, I don’t get anywhere near the climax I used to. This is true when I am on my own, too. I had powerful orgasms before and it is a tremendous loss. I am in my early 70s, and worry that this is the end of my libido, although I feel sure it ought not to be. Do you have any advice on how I can recover sensation? Covid has left a lot of people struggling with sexual difficulties and in many cases these dysfunctions are secondary to Covid-related depression and anxiety. Seek help for a possible mood disorder. At the same time, ask an open-minded and knowledgable doctor to check your hormone levels, since weak orgasms can be related to low levels of certain hormones, especially testosterone which may need to be boosted.

3/1/2022,"In the few fleeting days this February before Juan Martín del Potro was due to make his return to professional tennis on home soil at a small ATP 250 event in Buenos Aires the reality of what his first appearance in two and half years actually signified became clear. For much of the past 16 years Del Potro’s career has been dictated by each new bitter slice of luck he has had to overcome, with numerous career-threatening injuries and moments when he seriously contemplated retirement. But somehow, through the strength of his character and talent, he would always work through those tough moments and return to his rightful place at the top. Not this time. After three knee surgeries and no solution to a freak fractured knee injury sustained in 2018, even he has found his limits. “It’s more a farewell than a return,” he said. As Del Potro took to the court in Buenos Aires against his compatriot Federico Delbonis, before a raucous crowd filling every quiet moment with chants of “Olé Delpo!”, those limitations were clear for all to see. He was simply no longer mobile enough to compete at the highest level of tennis and in such a cut-throat sport not even his fellow coutryman spared him sympathy, peppering him with drop-shots he had no hope of reaching. Despite his considerable efforts Del Potro was beaten soundly, 6-1, 6-3, and the scene ended with him baring his soul to his audience for “probably” the last time: “I think I overdid it for two and half years to try and resolve the situation and be able to play, like I did so many other times,” he said through tears. “Sometimes I can also lose and I don’t have the strength to continue. That’s kind of how I feel now.” In the wake of this apparent retirement a documentary about Del Potro is due to air in Argentina on Tuesday night. Should he never play again, Del Potro will leave a legacy far greater than the weight of his one major title. He won the 2009 US Open aged 20 and the manner in which he pulled it off was unforgettable; he obliterated Rafael Nadal in the semi-final with the loss of only six games, then in the final he recovered from two sets to one down to beat Roger Federer. In the process of attaining his early success Del Potro fashioned his own devastating brand of tennis. His flat, precise forehand was the most destructive groundstroke in the game, a stroke that unfurled in an eastern forehand grip with a high, elaborate swing, and that was soundtracked by the gasps of crowds around the world whenever he would unleash it. His success did not rest merely on his ball-striking but also on his much-improved serve and the mobility that framed his game despite his lanky 6ft 6in frame. He was memorable not only because of the way he played his tennis but also his openness and generosity with his feelings, allowing his emotions to flow and reflect the deep passion he has for his sport. In both success and failure tears were always present but so, too, were those playful moments when he would add levity to pressure-filled matches by sharing small jokes and gestures with members of the audience. Whether conciliatory after a win or congratulatory following a loss, there was no greater proponent of the post-match hug. The result of Del Potro’s game, his passion and the way he comported himself – his gentle mannerisms contrasting with the crack of that forehand – was that fans were drawn to him much more than to many more successful players. Whether or not spectators had entered the arenas for his matches cheering for him, they usually fell in his favour by the end. Regardless of what his injuries took from him, Del Potro’s career was a triumph and, while his US Open title will always be widely considered his crowning achievement, the success he pulled off later in his career despite his on-court handicaps was an even clearer showing of greatness. Del Potro had already recovered from two right-wrist surgeries to reach a career-high ranking of fourth in 2014 when his left wrist crumbled. He eventually fell to 1,042 in the ATP rankings and underwent two left-wrist surgeries. When he returned in 2016 he could not drop his wrists below horizontal when he made contact with his two-handed backhand, so he resorted to using a one-handed backhand slice or rolling in his two-handed backhand down the middle with no pace. He was essentially playing tennis against the best players in the world with no backhand. Those are simply not conditions conducive to success for most players but, with his forehand and heart, Del Potro made it work. In 2016 alone he won an Olympic silver medal in Rio, beating Novak Djokovic in the first round and Nadal in the semi-final, and recovered from two sets down against Marin Cilic to clinch the Davis Cup that Argentina desperately craved. As the muscles in his wrist strengthened and his backhand became fractionally more effective, he soared even higher. In 2018 he won his first Masters 1000 title in Indian Wells, reached the US Open final and hit a new career high of No 3. After years of fighting his body the success he was enjoying makes his current state even more frustrating. He was actually winning those battles. His undoing was instead a freak injury after he slipped in the middle of a match in Shanghai, a month after the US Open final. Still the mark he has left in the sport is undeniable and his success is even more meaningful considering the resilience and mental strength it took for him to keep on coming back until he was certain he had nothing left to give.",Sport/Sport,Juan Martín del Potro’s probable farewell closes a storied career | Tumaini Carayol,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/01/juan-martin-del-potros-probable-farewell-closes-a-storied-career
3/1/2022,"A former SAS soldier has sought to avoid answering questions over allegations he murdered an unarmed Afghan civilian during a raid by Australian troops in 2009, telling the federal court “I object on grounds of self-incrimination”. The evidence of the former soldier, anonymised before court as Person 4, came as part of a defamation action brought by his former comrade, Victoria Cross recipient Ben Roberts-Smith. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times over reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying and domestic violence. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. The newspapers claim in their defence that Roberts-Smith ordered the alleged murder of an elderly Afghan male by Person 4 during a raid on a compound called Whiskey 108, in the village of Kakarak on 12 April 2009. Another Australian SAS soldier – known as Person 41 – previously gave evidence that two Afghan men, one elderly, were discovered hiding from Australian troops in a secret tunnel in a courtyard inside the Whiskey 108 compound. Person 41 said when the two men were found, Person 4 and Ben Roberts-Smith borrowed the suppressor from his weapon. Person 41 told the court he saw Roberts-Smith grab the elderly man “by the scruff of his shirt”, walk him until he was in front of Person 4, and force him to his knees. “RS [Roberts-Smith] pointed to the Afghan and said to Person 4, ‘shoot him’,” Person 41 told the court. Person 41 said he stepped into a room off the compound to avoid seeing what he believed was about to occur. He said he heard a muffled round fired from an M4 rifle, and waited “15 or so seconds” before stepping back into the courtyard. He said Roberts-Smith was no longer in the courtyard, but Person 4 was standing above the Afghan male, who was dead from a single bullet wound to the head. Roberts-Smith has previously told the court the allegation he had ordered the man shot was “completely false”. Person 4, who was medically discharged from the defence force last year, was asked by Arthur Moses SC, representing Ben Roberts-Smith: “Are you aware that the respondents in this case [the newspapers] have alleged you murdered an unarmed Afghan male on 12 April 2009?” “Your honour, I object on grounds of self-incrimination,” Person 4 told the judge. After vociferous legal debate, Justice Anthony Besanko ruled Person 4 was required to answer the question. Person 4 said “yes”, he was aware he had been accused of murder. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Moses asked Person 4 whether he was anxious that he had been subpoenaed – “unwillingly” – to give evidence in the trial brought by his former comrade. “You have been anxious that the respondents may put to you their allegation that you unlawfully killed an Afghan male on 12 April 2009.” Person 4 objected to answering again: “My only hesitation is in fear of incriminating myself.” The judge, this time, did not compel Person 4 to answer the question. “Thank you, your honour,” he replied. Much of Person 4’s testimony focused on his mental health following his military service, which included seven deployments to Afghanistan with the SAS. The judge ordered the suppression on reportage of the former soldier’s health conditions, and the names of the medications he has been prescribed. But Moses told court Person 4 has suffered from “flashbacks, nightmares, distressing memories of traumatic events” following his military service. Person 4 told the court he suffered “recurring thoughts … with that comes a feeling of dread and … flashbacks sometimes”. He agreed with Moses that he sometimes experienced memory loss. “I think the minutiae of things was fading away, small details – large details, definitely not,” he said. He denied assertions by the barrister that he experienced “hallucinations”, was “hearing things that are not real”, was worried “someone is trying to harm you,” or heard “people screaming”. He also denied experiencing “any confusion about events you think you’ve experienced”. Moses told the court Person 4’s health issues were exacerbated by being subpoenaed by the newspapers to give evidence. “We’re talking about a vulnerable person with significant mental health issues, with assertions being made, openly, that this person murdered an unarmed Afghan male on 12 April 2009.” Moses told the court a “side deal” had been done between Person 4 and lawyers for the newspapers, whereby the newspapers’ lawyers had agreed not to question Person 4 about the events at Whiskey 108, in exchange for Person 4 giving evidence about another raid at Darwan in 2012. In that raid, Roberts-Smith is alleged to have kicked a handcuffed, unarmed civilian off a cliff before the man was shot dead by another soldier under Roberts-Smith’s command. Person 4 told the court he had seen Roberts-Smith kick the handcuffed man off the cliff: “I saw the individual smash his face on a rock, and I saw the teeth explode out of his face.” Person 4 said Roberts-Smith ordered him and another subordinate to drag the man under a tree, where he was shot by the other soldier after discussion with Roberts-Smith. Roberts-Smith has previously told the court this version of events could not have happened because there was no cliff and the man killed was an enemy spotter, lawfully killed after he was encountered hiding in a field. Moses said the “transaction, arrangement, side deal, whatever they wish to call it” struck between Person 4 and the newspapers’ legal team undermined the credibility of his evidence. “The witness is, in effect, being influenced to give evidence, in exchange for [lawyers for the newspapers] not seek to have him compelled to answer questions about an alleged murder. That goes to his [Person 4’s] credibility and the reliability of his other evidence.” He said the striking of a pre-trial arrangement was highly improper and had been done without the knowledge of the court. He said the newspapers’ lawyers had said, in effect, “we’ll take this from you, so we can sink Mr Roberts-Smith in this trial, but we won’t ask you about your murder”. Nick Owens SC, acting for the newspapers, has argued there was no agreement, nor any improper arrangement, merely that he had made a forensic decision not to press certain questions if the witness objected. During cross-examination, Person 4 told the court he was approached by members of the media to talk about events in Afghanistan, but he did not reply. He told the court he believed an SAS comrade, Person 6, was encouraging people to speak with the media “to discredit Ben Roberts-Smith”. He agreed with Moses that Person 6 “wanted to bring Mr Roberts-Smith down”. Person 4 remains in the witness box. The trial continues.",News/Australia news,Witness in Ben Roberts-Smith trial objects to questions about alleged murder of Afghan civilian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/01/witness-in-ben-roberts-smith-trial-objects-to-questions-about-alleged-of-afghan-civilian
3/1/2022,"People working for the government’s conservation watchdog are so underpaid that it is threatening the UK’s ability to reach net-zero pledges, a trade union report warns. Salaries of those working for the government agency Natural England have fallen by 20% in real terms over the last decade, with starting pay thousands of pounds lower than private and charity-sector equivalents, according to the Prospect union’s Natural England 2022 report. Low pay and rising levels stress means the agency is struggling to fulfil its duties of protecting the natural environment, according to the report. “Poor pay remains a huge and worsening risk to Natural England and the work it does,” it says. “Comprehensive reform, supported with true additional funding, is urgently required.” Natural England’s responsibilities include looking after the country’s most important wildlife sites, paying farmers to protect wildlife and advising on planning applications. The government says protecting wildlife is a key part of its environmental policy, but has failed to back that up with action that protects the people looking after the natural environment, the report warns. Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of Prospect, said: “Cop26 was not just about carbon and power but about protecting biodiversity and the natural environment. If you are not seen to be properly investing in that then it calls into question your commitment to other aspects of your agenda, such as achieving energy efficiency, low-carbon generation and a green jobs revolution.” Natural England is responsible for the maintenance of many carbon-rich habitats such as peatlands, wetlands and woodlands, which will be a key component of reaching net-zero targets. “Our argument is that if you don’t properly fund the stewards of our natural environment and you lose skills and capability then it becomes much harder to achieve your overall environmental objectives, including net zero,” said Graham. It follows a report in 2020 warning that staffing levels had been “cut to the bone” after years of employees being underpaid and overworked. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) – which funds Natural England – has injected more in the last two years but its total budget has fallen by 49% in real terms since 2008-09. The report recommends a comprehensive reform of pay. It concludes: “Natural England staff deserve better than having to work on the cheap, to deploy their complex skill sets to advise government on the cheap, or to service the Environment Act 2021 on the cheap. This must now change.” Amelia Womack, deputy leader of the Green party, said: “This is another demonstration of how little value the government really places on tackling the climate and ecological emergency. The highly skilled staff of Natural England, who work hard to safeguard our environment for the benefit of citizens, businesses and agriculture, are being pushed out by low pay. “With the latest IPCC report warning that the climate crisis is accelerating out of control, the government must prioritise, like never before, the jobs of those who are working on the frontline in the fight against climate change.” A Natural England spokesperson said the agency was working with trade unions to reform pay for Natural England staff, but that it was constrained by pay rules set out by the Treasury. “We value our staff hugely and have for some time recognised and acknowledged many of the issues being raised in this report,” they said. “A shrinking budget in the recent past had brought particular difficulties for our teams, but the wellbeing of staff has and continues to be a top priority. “We have in the last two years secured more resources for nature and the multi-year investment through the recent spending review will mean we can a long way to tackling workloads, alongside our plans to reform the grades and pay band to which staff all are assigned.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Low pay ‘threatens Natural England’s conservation role and UK’s net-zero target’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/01/low-pay-natural-england-conservation-uk-net-zero-target-risk-prospect-union-report-aoe
