12/31/2021,"A 14-year-old girl was killed by a stray bullet discharged by an LAPD officer last week. LAPD identified the officer Thursday as William Dorsey Jones Jr. Jones started a nonprofit last year called ""Officers for Change."" The Los Angeles Police Department on Thursday identified William Dorsey Jones Jr. as the officer who killed a 24-year-old assault suspect and 14-year-old Valentina Orellana-Peralta during an incident at a North Hollywood store last week. A lawyer for Jones, 42, did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment but told The New York Times Jones is on paid administrative leave while the LAPD investigates the incident. The lawyer, Leslie Wilcox, told The Times Jones was surprised by anger directed at him, ""as if Valentina's death was intentional, or reckless on his part, which it was neither."" Orellana-Peralta was killed when LAPD responded to a report of a man assaulting people with a deadly weapon in a Burlington Coat Factory. Upon arrival, police witnessed the man assaulting another person and opened fire, LAPD told Insider. The suspect, Daniel Elena Lopez, was shot and killed. Orellana-Peralta, who was hiding with her mother in a dressing room during the confrontation, was struck by a bullet that police said ricocheted off the floor. According to The Times, Jones started a nonprofit in 2020 called ""Officers for Change"" to improve the relationship between police and the community. Jones, a Black man, also spoke about being a victim of racism and using his position as an officer to advocate for change. At press time, the group's Facebook page had been taken down, and its Instagram account had been set to private. ""I'm a Black man, I'm the father of a Black son,"" Jones wrote on Twitter in August, according to digital archives viewed by The Times. His digital presence has since been wiped clean. ""I'm the LAPD. I have the power & determination to affect CHANGE in the community."" In 2020, Jones' alma mater, the University of Lousiville, interviewed him. The post has since been removed from the site, but Insider retrieved an archived copy of the story. ""Being an African American police officer and from Louisville has given me a very unique perspective,"" he told the outlet. ""During the current social climate, I realize the opportunities that I and all others have living here in the United States have been blessed with. The access to education is a luxury that others around the globe don't have, and many of us minorities don't take advantage of.""

12/31/2021,"In recent years, Michael has come to regard the United States, the nation of which he has been a citizen all his life, as an abusive parent. “I can acknowledge my past association with that person while at the same time wanting to keep future association to a minimum,” he said. Michael – the name is false as he requested anonymity to avoid being inundated with hate mail – found his disaffection with his native country reach crunch point in 2020. The chaotic end of the Donald Trump era combined with the inequities exposed by the Covid pandemic made him despair of being an American. “Coronavirus made me realize that in the US, if you’re not a member of the moneyed elite you’re left to fend for yourself with virtually no help from the federal government,” he said. “The farcical presidential campaign made me realize that I don’t want to be a member of a society in which my vote is made irrelevant by gerrymandering or the electoral college.” And so Michael decided to renounce his US citizenship. Having moved to Finland 10 years ago, he would break the ties that officially bound him to a country whose values he no longer recognised. That’s when Michael’s troubles really began. He discovered that along with thousands of other US citizens living abroad, he was caught in a Kafkaesque trap. For almost two years, since the pandemic struck in March 2020, most US consular missions around the world have suspended their expatriation services for those wishing to give up US citizenship. The US embassy in London, the largest of its sort in western Europe, announces on its website that it is “currently unable to accept appointments for loss of nationality applications” and is unable to say when services will resume. The US state department says giving up citizenship requires a face-to-face interview with a government official, and that it is too risky given coronavirus. Delays have led to a growing mountain of disgruntled citizens. By some calculations, there may be as many as 30,000 people among the 9 million US citizens living abroad who would like to begin the renunciation process but can’t. Joshua Grant is one of them. He was born and raised in Selma, Alabama, until he moved to Germany when he was 21 to learn the language. He has been there ever since. He lives in Lower Saxony and married a German citizen last year. Grant, 30, feels ready to acquire German citizenship, but under German law he must let go of his US passport. Easier said than done. He submitted a pile of paperwork to the US embassy in July 2020. Nothing has happened. He has written emails to the embassy staff, with no reply. He contacted the office of US senator from Alabama Richard Shelby. They passed him on to the state department, which in turn passed him back to the bureau of consular affairs, which mentioned the pandemic. “It’s very taxing. My whole life in Germany is on hold,” he said. “It’s funny: people in Germany tend to see the US as a liberal country where the rule of law was established, but I can’t even find anyone in the US government to talk to.” Nine US citizens abroad who have found themselves unable to give up their nationality are now suing the state department in a federal court in Washington. The suit, brought on the plaintiffs’ behalf by the French-based group Association of Accidental Americans, likens the situation to feudal times. “The US appears intent on preventing its citizens from exercising their natural and fundamental right to voluntarily renounce their citizenship,” it says. Some people want to give up US citizenship because the government has been making the burden of being an American more onerous for those abroad. In 2010 the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) was passed, requiring foreign banks and other financial institutions to report on any clients they suspect of being American to the IRS. The US is also one of only two countries (the other is Eritrea) that tax people on their citizenship rather than where they live. That forces Americans abroad to declare their global income to the IRS, with possible tax implications. The impact of these burdens is reflected in the number of people who renounce each year. Between 2000 and 2010 it remained relatively steady at less than 1,000 people, but after FATCA came in, the numbers rose sharply to a peak last year of almost 7,000. Some of the would-be renouncers are “accidental Americans”, having acquired citizenship because they were born in the US though they have lived elsewhere all their lives. That label could be applied to the UK prime minister Boris Johnson, who was born in New York but has not lived in the US since he was five. Johnson renounced his citizenship in 2017, having said he was outraged a few years earlier by having to pay the US tax authorities for gains on the sale of his London home. Marie Sock, the first woman to stand as a presidential candidate in the Gambia, was forced to pull out of the race recently after she failed to get any response to her request to renounce her US nationality from the US embassy. She explained in a video posted on Facebook that under Gambia election law, presidential candidates must be sole Gambian nationals. James – also not his real name – was born in Texas but has not lived in the US since he was four. He now lives in Singapore. He became disillusioned when he learned that because his son was born outside the US he would not be eligible for US citizenship, and yet because of James’s citizenship he would treated as if he were a US taxpayer. That struck him as a modern form of taxation without representation. “The double standards really annoy me,” he said. For the past year he has been trying to get through to an official who will help him renounce his citizenship, without success. “I never asked for US citizenship, and now I’m not even allowed to give it up.”",World/The Guardian,Americans seeking to renounce their citizenship are stuck with it for now,https://news.yahoo.com/americans-seeking-renounce-citizenship-stuck-070013896.html
12/31/2021,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's anti-graft agency on Friday accused U.S. retail giant Walmart Inc and its Sam's Club chain of ""stupidity and shorted-sightedness"" after social media users alleged that Sam's Club had removed Xinjiang-sourced products from stores. Last week, Sam's Club came under fire in China after users of the Weibo social media platform shared screenshots allegedly showing that products from the far-western Chinese region of Xinjiang had been removed from the store's online app. The social media row erupted soon after U.S. President Joe Biden signed into law on Dec. 23 legislation banning imports from Xinjiang over concern about forced labour there. Neither Walmart nor Sam's Club have made public statements on the matter, and Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. The ruling Communist Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), in a statement on its website, accused Sam's Club of boycotting Xinjiang products and trying to ""muddle through"" the issue of Xinjiang by remaining silent. ""To take down all products from a region without a valid reason hides an ulterior motive, reveals stupidity and short-sightedness, and will surely have its own bad consequences,"" the commission said.

12/31/2021,"SHEDAI CAMP, Afghanistan (AP) — In a sprawling settlement of mud brick huts in western Afghanistan housing people displaced by drought and war, a woman is fighting to save her daughter. Aziz Gul’s husband sold the 10-year-old girl into marriage without telling his wife, taking a down-payment so he could feed his family of five children. Without that money, he told her, they would all starve. He had to sacrifice one to save the rest. Many of Afghanistan’s growing number of destitute people are making desperate decisions such as these as their nation spirals into a vortex of poverty. The aid-dependent country’s economy was already teetering when the Taliban seized power in mid-August amid a chaotic withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops. The international community froze Afghanistan’s assets abroad and halted all funding, unwilling to work with a Taliban government given its reputation for brutality during its previous rule 20 years ago. The consequences have been devastating for a country battered by four decades of war, a punishing drought and the coronavirus pandemic. Legions of state employees, including doctors, haven’t been paid in months. Malnutrition and poverty stalk the most vulnerable, and aid groups say more than half the population faces acute food shortages. “Day by day, the situation is deteriorating in this country, and especially children are suffering,” said Asuntha Charles, national director of the World Vision aid organization in Afghanistan, which runs a health clinic for displaced people just outside the western city of Herat. “Today I have been heartbroken to see that the families are willing to sell their children to feed other family members,” Charles said. “So it’s the right time for the humanitarian community to stand up and stay with the people of Afghanistan.” Arranging marriages for very young girls is a frequent practice throughout the region. The groom’s family - often distant relatives - pays money to seal the deal, and the child usually stays with her own parents until she is at least around 15 or 16. Yet with many unable to afford even basic food, some say they’d allow prospective grooms to take very young girls or are even trying to sell their sons. But Gul, unusually in this deeply patriarchal, male-dominated society, is resisting. Married off herself at 15, she says she would kill herself if her daughter, Qandi Gul, is forcibly taken away. Gul remembers well the moment she found out her husband had sold Qandi. For around two months, the family had been able to eat. Eventually, she asked her husband where the money came from, and he told her. “My heart stopped beating. I wished I could have died at that time, but maybe God didn’t want me to die,” Gul said. Qandi sat close to her mother, her hazel eyes peering shyly from beneath her sky-blue headscarf. “Each time I remember that night...I die and come back to life. It was so difficult.” She asked her husband why he did it. “He said he wanted to sell one and save the others. ‘You all would have died this way,’ (he said.) I told him, ‘Dying was much better than what you have done.'” Gul rallied her community, telling her brother and village elders that her husband had sold her child behind her back. They supported her, and with their help she secured a “divorce” for her child, but only on condition she repays the 100,000 afghanis (about $1,000) that her husband received. It’s money she doesn’t have. Her husband fled, possibly fearing Gul might denounce him to the authorities. The Taliban government recently announced a ban on forcing women into marriage or using women and girls as exchange tokens to settle disputes. The family of the prospective groom, a man of around 21 or 22, has already tried several times to claim the girl, she says. She is not sure how long she can fend them off. “I am just so desperate. If I can’t provide money to pay these people and can’t keep my daughter by my side, I have said that I will kill myself,” Gul said. “But then I think about the other children. What will happen to them? Who will feed them?” Her eldest is 12, her youngest - her sixth - just two months. Now alone, Gul leaves the children with her elderly mother while she goes to work in people’s homes. Her 12-year-old son works picking saffron after school. It’s barely enough to keep them fed, and the saffron season is short, only a few weeks in the fall. “We don’t have anything,” Gul said. In another part of the same camp, father-of-four Hamid Abdullah was also selling his young daughters into arranged marriages, desperate for money to treat his chronically ill wife, pregnant with their fifth child. Abdullah borrowed money to pay for his wife’s treatments and can’t pay it back, he said. So three years ago, he received a down-payment for his eldest daughter Hoshran, now 7, in an arranged marriage to an 18-year-old in their native Badghis province. He’s now looking for someone to buy his second daughter, 6-year-old Nazia. “We don’t have food to eat,” Abdullah explained, adding he also had to buy medicine for his wife, who soon would need more treatment. “She needs another surgery, I don’t have one afghani to pay for the doctor.” The family that bought Hoshran is waiting until she is older before the full amount is settled, he explained. But he needs money now for food and treatments, so he is trying to arrange a marriage for Nazia for about 20,000-30,000 afghani ($200-$300). “What should we do? We have to do it, we have no other option,” said his wife, Bibi Jan. “When we made the decision, it was like someone had taken away a body part from me.” In the neighboring province of Badghis, another displaced family is considering selling their son, 8-year-old Salahuddin. His mother, Guldasta, said that after days with nothing to eat, she told her husband to take the boy to the bazaar and sell him to bring food for the others. “I don’t want to sell my son, but I have to,” the 35-year-old said. “No mother can do this to her child, but when you have no other choice, you have to make a decision against your will.” Salahuddin blinked and looked on silently. Surrounded by some of his seven brothers and sisters, his lip quivered slightly. His father, Shakir, who is blind in one eye and has kidney problems, said the children had been crying for days from hunger. Twice, he said, he decided to take the boy to the bazaar and twice he faltered, unable to go through with it. “But now I think I have no other choice than to sell him.” Buying of boys is believed to be less common than girls, and when it does take place, it appears to be cases of infant boys bought by families who don’t have any sons. In her despair, Guldasta thought perhaps such a family would want an 8-year-old. The desperation of millions is clear as more and more people face hunger. By the end of the year, some 3.2 million children under 5 years old are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition, according to the U.N. Nazia is one of them. The 4-year-old lay listlessly in her mother’s arms after visiting the World Vision health clinic. Two years ago, Nazia was a plump toddler, her mother Fatima said. Now, her emaciated limbs are just skin covering bone. Her little heart beats visibly beneath her ribcage. “The prices are high. Flour is expensive, cooking oil is expensive, everything is expensive,” Fatima said. “All day she is asking me to give her meat, yogurt and fruit. We don’t have anything, and we don’t have money to buy it for her.” Charles, World Vision’s national director for Afghanistan, said humanitarian aid funds are desperately needed. “I’m happy to see the pledges are made,” she said. But the pledges “shouldn’t stay as promises, they have to be seen as reality on the ground.” ____ Abdul Qahar Afghan in Shedai Camp, Afghanistan and Rahim Faiez in Islamabad, Pakistan contributed. ___ Follow Becatoros on Twitter on: https://twitter.com/ElenaBec",World/Associated Press,Parents selling children shows desperation of Afghanistan,https://news.yahoo.com/parents-selling-children-shows-desperation-060506038.html
