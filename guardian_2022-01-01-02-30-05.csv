1/1/2022,"London has recorded its highest ever level of teenage homicides in a single year after two teens were killed on Thursday. A 15-year-old boy was stabbed to death in a park in Croydon on Thursday night, while a 16-year-old boy died after being stabbed in Hillingdon.  The killings were the 29th and 30th teenage homicides in the capital in 2021, surpassing the previous peak of 29 in 2008. Most of those who died were victims of knife crime and many were killed by other teenagers or by those in their early 20s. The youngest victim was 14 years old. Here is a list of the 30 victims and what we know about their lives and how they died. Anas Mezenner, 17, Haringey, north London, 19 January Mezenner, 17, was found with stab wounds in West Green Road, Haringey, north London, shortly after 9pm on 19 January. He was taken to hospital but died at 4.25am. A 17-year-old boy was found guilty of his murder after a trial at the Old Bailey in August, and two other teenagers were found guilty of his manslaughter. The teenager, who was studying at a City and Islington College and was described as “quietly talented” and “creative”, had made an anti-knife crime video for a media studies course weeks before he died. His brother said: “Anas was never, never about this knife crime stupidity. He always kept himself humble, he was always kind and always put others first.” Romario Opia, 15, Islington, north London, 25 JanuaryOpia was found stabbed in Holland Walk, Islington, north London, at about 5.30pm. He was pronounced dead at the scene a short while later. His mum is said to have dashed to the scene when she heard her son had been attacked. More than 100 people attended a vigil in his honour on 2 February where he fell. His sister wrote an emotional tribute to Opia when she launched a crowdfunding appeal to help the family cover the funeral and burial costs, describing him as “funny, loving [and] amazing”. She continued: “Everywhere he went he made a big impact on everyone and all his friends and family love and miss him so much. Everyone who knew Romario knows he had a big smile and an enthusiasm for life. He made everyone laugh, he was happy and confident and had a big heart.” Hani Solomon, 18, Fulham, west London, 11 February Solomon was killed during a fight between two groups of men shortly after 6.30pm in Ackmar Road, Fulham, west London. He was treated by police, paramedics and an air ambulance team but was pronounced dead at the scene less than an hour later. Two people have been charged with his murder. Solomon, who was from Wandsworth in south London, was described as “one of the nicest boys around, always positive, always smiling” by one of his friends, Noah. Another friend Tyrell Logan said: “He was a friend you could always count on … If you can’t afford something, he’s there for you. If you can’t do something, he’ll do it for you – that’s how he works, that was his moral in life.” Drekwon Patterson, 16, Wembley, north-west London, 18 February Patterson was stabbed just yards from Preston Road underground station in Brent, shortly after 11.30pm. He was taken to hospital but died the following morning. Five people were arrested in early-morning raids by officers in April, but no one has been charged. Patterson, who was a pupil at Harrow college, was killed months after his parents had relocated for safety after an attack in November. His friend Ty told the Daily Mail: “Drekwon was not affiliated to any gang, I can promise you that. He was very funny and a proper entertainer. He loved making us laugh. He was very street smart and I’m going to miss him a lot.” Ahmed Beker, 19, Paddington Green, west London, 26 February Beker was attacked just after 9.10pm and was treated by paramedics and an air ambulance team but died at the scene. Two teenagers, both aged 18, have been charged with murder. His cousin Josiph Beker was stabbed to death in Edgware in 2019. The boy’s uncle and Josiph’s dad, James Beker, told MyLondon that his nephew was humble, kind and quiet and said the family was devastated by his death. He continued: “We will never be healed from it … We are not in the war. How can they do this? How can they carry a knife to kill people?” Tai Jordan O’Donnell, 19, Croydon, south London, 3 March O’Donnell was stabbed a number of times in the legs at a house in Alpha Road just after 12.10pm. He was pronounced dead within minutes of emergency crews arriving at the scene. A 22-year-old man has been charged with his murder. In a statement released online, Tai’s mother, Stacey O’Donnell, said: “He was one in a million; a loving, kind, beautiful human being and we as family couldn’t be prouder of the man he was growing into.” His friends organised several memorials to celebrate his life after he died. One of his friends, Dwaine, from Croydon, said: “I met him at college about three years ago, and everyone who knew him thought he was a good person: kind, polite, respectful.” Mazaza Owusu-Mensah, 18, Abbey Wood, south-east London, 6 March Owusu-Mensah died when he was stabbed in the chest during a fight in Edington Road, Abbey Wood, south-east London, at about 5.30pm. Paramedics tried to save him, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. A 25-year-old man has been charged with murder and possession of an offensive weapon. One tribute posted on Snapchat read: “RIP Maz. [We were] brothers. I’m gonna miss you, we’ll link up soon. Life feels so different I can’t take it in. We had big dreams bro, I’m gonna miss you lord knows it ain’t gonna be the same without you.” Ezra Okobia, 14, Lewisham, south-east London, 6 MarchOkobia was fatally injured by fumes from a fire at his home in Russett Way shortly before 6am. He was taken to hospital but died four days later. His five-year-old brother, Joseph Okobia, and mother, Victoria Amaning, 34, also died after inhaling fumes. Amaning “used petrol to start a fire” in her Greenwich home, before “locking herself and her sons in the bathroom”, killing herself and the two young children in March this year, an inquest has heard. Little has been reported about Okobia’s life, but shortly after the fire took place, before it emerged how it started, one neighbour told the Sun: “The whole community is absolutely devastated by what has happened and we are all still in shock … Her two sons were her everything, all the children, including my own, all used to play together down here, we’re a very close community like that.” Nikolay Vandev, 19, Tottenham, north London, 8 MarchVandev was stabbed along with a second victim, aged 18, in Penshurst Road, Tottenham, north London, shortly before 2pm. He was pronounced dead at the scene, while the 18-year-old was taken to hospital and treated for non life-threatening stab wounds. Two boys, aged 15 and 17, have been charged with murder. Vandev was the fourth person to be killed in Tottenham in 2021, with the Metropolitan police increasing officer patrols after the killing. DCS Treena Fleming, who is responsible for policing in Haringey, said: “My deepest sympathies lie with the family and friends of those who have lost their lives in this tragic way. My top priority remains tackling violent crime in our community – as one person killed or injured is one person too many.” Hussain Chaudhry, 18, Walthamstow, east London, 17 March Chaudhry was stabbed in Lea Bridge Road, Walthamstow, east London, at about 5.20pm. Police and an ambulance crew attended but he was pronounced dead at the scene. Chaudhry was knifed in the neck as he and his family fought off a robber trying to steal a designer jacket outside their home. His brother and mother were also injured. Two people have been charged with his murder. The first-year law student at Soas University died in his mum’s arms. Hussain’s devastated uncle Reiss Chaudhry said: “He was just trying to protect his mum. He was a good boy and such a lovely boy. His mum was badly cut across her hand and his brother was hurt too, and they are both still in surgery. He was stabbed in the neck and he died laying in his mother’s lap.” Levi Ernest-Morrison, 17, Sydenham, south-east London, 10 April Ernest-Morrison, who was autistic, was killed in a machete and knife attack in Sydenham Road on the evening of 10 April. Tyreese Ulysses, 19, launched the attack after learning that Ernest-Morrison was “bothering” his mother, Nichola Leighton, by knocking on her door looking for him. Both Ulysses and Leighton were found guilty of Ernest-Morrison’s murder earlier this month. Ernest-Morrison’s father, Christopher, described his son as “loved”, saying: “He had a simple way of touching people.” Meanwhile, his mother called him a “special boy” and said: “He was a beautiful boy with a beautiful heart. My son was autistic and disabled so it hurts more.” Fares Maatou, 15, Newham, east London, April 23 Maatou was found stabbed in Barking Road in what his family have described as an “unprovoked attack”. Emergency services tried to save him but he was pronounced dead just over half an hour later, still wearing his school uniform. Two boys, aged 14 and 15, have pleaded not guilty to his murder and will face trial next year. A crowdfunding page set up by Maatou’s family said he was a “kind and considerate child who stood up for what’s right”. The page also states that his father had been in a coma since January after being admitted into the ICU with Covid-19 and woke up to find his son had been murdered. His friends also paid tribute and told PA: “If you ever needed him he would be there. He was happy. He loved life.” Abubakkar ‘Junior’ Jah, 18, Newham, east London, 26, April Jah was found in Coolfin Road, at about 3.45pm, having been shot and stabbed. He died at the scene. He was the brother of Ahmed Jah, who was stabbed to death just a few streets from the scene in April 2017. Police believe the killings may have been linked. Nobody has been charged with Jah’s murder. His father, who had fled war-torn Sierra Leone to come to the UK in the 1990s, told the Daily Mail: “I don’t understand how somebody can be killed like that, right in front of their house. I’m not able to sleep. [Junior] was my friend. I saw some future in him and he held my hope, but now that’s vanished.” Daniel Laskos, 16, Harold Wood, east London, 7 May Laskos was fatally stabbed in the neck stabbed in Church Road, just after 6.40pm after being confronted by a gang outside a shop. Ambulance and air ambulance teams tried to save him after the fight but he died at the scene. Six people have been charged with his murder. His uncle John said Daniel’s family had come to London from the Czech Republic about a decade ago. He added: “He was a lovely boy. His mother is devastated. We have no idea why this happened.” Taylor Cox, 19, Islington, north London, 8 JuneCox was shot in the head in Hornsey Rise Gardens at about 4.25pm. He later died in hospital. One person has been charged with murder. His father, David Campbell, said he had previously survived a stabbing in 2019. Campbell, who moved the family to the outskirts of London after the first attack, told the Islington Gazette the stabbing crushed his dreams of being a professional footballer. He said: “He became less confident after the stabbing and didn’t want to go certain places. If he went out he took a cab because he was scared for his life. In the last couple of weeks he seemed happier.” Denardo Samuels-Brooks, 17, Streatham, south London, 10 JuneSamuels-Brooks was stabbed after he was chased along a busy high street in the mid-afternoon. He was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead less than an hour later. Four people, all teenagers from Croydon, have been charged with murder. The local MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy said on Twitter: “My thoughts and prayers are with the family of the young man, stabbed to death on Streatham High Road this afternoon. Arrests have been made and an investigation is ongoing in the area.” Jalan Woods-Bell, 15, Hayes, west London, 11 June Woods-Bell was stabbed in a fight at about 8.30am while on his way to school in Blyth Road. A 15-year-old boy has been charged with his murder. “He was quite cheeky in a funny way and mischievous with that smile … he was just a really good character and wasn’t one to shy away,” his uncle told My London. He added that his nephew had a supportive family and group of school friends who were all in shock. Tashawn Watt, 19, Sydenham, south-east London, 25 June Watt was stabbed in Miall Walk just after 9.30pm. He was treated by an ambulance crew but died at the scene. He was just yards from his house when he was attacked and his mother and brother cradled him in the street as he died. A 19-year-old has been charged with his murder. Tributes poured in after his death with the street lined with hundreds of flowers. Denise proudly told My London: “We called him ‘star boy’, because he was … He made me proud at parents’ evening because every teacher had the same thing to say about his potential.” Camron Smith, 16, Shrublands, Croydon, south London, 1 JulySmith was found by paramedics having been stabbed inside his home in Croydon in the early hours of 1 July. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Police believe he was chased after answering the door to a group who then attacked him. Four teenagers, including a 15-year-old boy, have been charged with his murder. Mourners gathered to lay flowers around the cordon after his murder. Devastated friends said Camron, known as LilCamz, was “never in a group or a gang”. Tamim Ian Habimana, 15, Woolwich, south-east London, 5 July Four teenagers were soon charged with his murder after Tamin was found stabbed. Footage of the killing was shared widely on social media. Hawa Haragakiza, Tamin’s mother spoke at a vigil in Woolwich after his death, promising to begin campaigning for an end to London’s knife-crime epidemic. She said: “My son was all about peace and where I’m coming from, I’m all about peace.” Keane Flynn-Harling, 16, Lambeth, south London, 5 July Flynn-Harling was stabbed in Oval Place, south London, at about 11.45pm. A 36-year-old has been charged with his murder and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place. He was named after the former Tottenham Hotspur striker Robbie Keane by his Spurs-loving family. “I’m so sorry you’re gone.

He was a kind, respectful boy.” Stelios Averkiou, 16, Tottenham, north London, 1 AugustAverkiou was stabbed at a skate park in Lordship recreation ground at about 2.15pm.

Hazrat Wali, 18, Twickenham, 12 October Wali was stabbed to death in a playing field in front of schoolchildren. A 16-year-old boy has been charged with his murder. He was a refugee from Afhganistan. He had moved to the UK two years earlier and was studying construction and building in the nearby Richmond upon Thames College. His friend Sahil Kochay told the Evening Standard: “He didn’t hold any hate towards anybody. He used to stand up for everyone.” Kamran Khalid, 18, Ilford, east London, 28 October Khalid was stabbed to death in Harrow Road in the early hours of the morning on 28 October. He was reportedly on his way home from the gym when the attack took place. Kamran was stabbed 24 times. Two teenagers, the youngest just 15 years old, have been charged with murder. Speaking to MyLondon, his mother, Samina Khalid, said losing him has “left a void in her heart forever”. Jermaine Cools, 14, Croydon, 18 November Cools, the youngest victim, suffered stab wounds and died after a fight in London Road. He took himself to the nearby hospital, but died soon after from multiple stab wounds. A murder investigation was launched after the incident but no one has been arrested. His father, Julius Cools, said he forgives his son’s killers, describing his son as “an angel”. DCI Richard Vandenbergh, from the Metropolitan police, is continuing to appeal for information over the murder, saying “at the very least, his parents are owed an explanation for why their son was killed”. Rishmeet Singh, 16, Southall, 24 November The Met was called to Raleigh Road in Southall just after 9pm after reports of a stabbing following a fight involving a group of people. Officers found 16-year-old Rishmeet with stab wounds. He died at the scene a short time later. Friends of the 16-year-old told ITV News London he had never been involved in crime or violence.

Unnamed boy, 16, Hillingdon, west London, 30 DecemberThe Met was called to Philpot’s Farm Open Space in Yiewsley, and found a 16-year-old boy with a puncture wound. He was pronounced dead at 8.25pm and a murder investigation was launched, making him the 30th teenage homicide in London in 2021, surpassing the previous peak of 29 in 2008.",News/UK news,‘He was not in any gang’: lives and deaths of 30 teenage London homicides,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/31/knife-rises-in-london-with-30-teen-homicides-in-2021
1/1/2022,"The UK has experienced its hottest New Year’s Eve on record, with temperatures reaching more than 15C (59F) and customers being turned away from ice rinks that had melted. The record was broken twice in one day, with the Met Office recording 14.9C at 11am on Friday in Ryehill, in East Yorkshire, and 15.3C about an hour later in Coningsby, in Lincolnshire. The previous 31 December high was 14.8C, observed in Colwyn Bay in north Wales in 2011.  At Somerset House, one of London’s most popular event venues, the unseasonably warm temperature forced the closure of the ice rink attraction on Thursday and Friday, with similar scenes at the ice rink in Hampton Court in Surrey. In Berkshire, some people had New Year’s Eve ice creams, as visitors to Windsor enjoyed the alfresco cafes. Unfortunately, we have had to close our ice rink for this evening (30 Dec) and tomorrow (31 Dec). As we have had several days of warm ambient temperature, the quality of the ice is not sufficient to ensure the safety of our customers. 1/2 The Met office said temperatures would continue to climb across the country later on Friday, before falling slightly at night as the UK rings in 2022. Areas of southern and eastern England, including the West Country, London and Lincolnshire, were expected to experience the warmest weather. Revellers in some parts of the UK will have to brace for rain in the evening, with light drizzle expected across pockets of eastern and southern England and north Wales. However, the overall picture was “exceptionally mild”, with temperatures of 14.5C in Hawarden, north Wales, and 14.2C in Yeovil, Somerset, reported on Friday morning, forecasters said. In Bournemouth, on England’s southern coast, people strolled along the seafront enjoying the mild weather. It came after what was likely to have been Britain’s dullest December since the 1950s, with less than 27 hours of sunlight across the country on average. The Met office said there had been just 26.6 hours of sunshine over 30 days – 38% less than the national average for this time of year. The figure places this month in the running to become one of the 10 dreariest Decembers on record, forecasters said. Britain’s dullest December was in 1956, when 19.5 hours of sunlight was the national average, while the brightest was in 2001, with 64 hours recorded on average across the UK. The Met office forecaster Craig Snell said the dull weather was linked to milder temperatures across winter generally, which are likely to be due to the climate crisis. “One of the reasons we’re getting the dull weather is the fact that it’s been so mild. We’re drawing in south-westerly wind from the Atlantic and it’s also drawing in a lot of moisture. It keeps us warm but it also produces a lot of cloud,” he said. “The globe is warming up, so we would expect our winters to be milder than they were.”",News/UK news,UK has warmest New Year’s Eve on record as temperatures top 15C,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/31/uk-records-warmest-new-years-eve-on-record
1/1/2022,"London has recorded its worst ever annual death toll from teenage homicides after two boys were killed within an hour of each other in stabbing incidents, bringing the total to 30 for 2021. A 15-year-old was stabbed and killed in south London and a 16-year-old in west London on Thursday, bringing the total beyond the 29 deaths recorded in 2008.  Campaigners said efforts to tackle knife crime had been inadequate and it was now so prevalent, it was becoming normalised, while a senior Labour politician called on the government to take more action to deal with the “epidemic”. “Knife crime is accepted by this generation as part-and-parcel of growing up and that’s completely unacceptable,” said Patrick Green, the chief executive of the anti-knife crime charity the Ben Kinsella Trust, which was set up in 2008 following the fatal stabbing of 16-year-old Ben in north London. “It shows that not enough has been done and, if I’m being really critical, then I’d say the approach to tackling it has been scattergun. We have to sustain our response to knife crime, it has to be over the long term and not just one and two-year funding for projects. “It is a societal problem which will continue unless it is addressed properly.” Yvette Cooper MP, the shadow home secretary, said the news was “devastating”. She added: “It is truly awful that more young lives have been lost to the epidemic of knife crime across the country. No family should have to go through losing a child in this way. “Important further action is needed from government to tackle the knife crime epidemic – including more neighbourhood police back on the beat, stronger laws on the criminal exploitation that draws children and young people into drug and knife crime, and support for the youth services and early intervention work that keep young people safe.” They spoke after a 16-year-old boy was pronounced dead at 8.25pm on Thursday, having been stabbed at Philpot’s Farm, in Yiewsley, west London. About an hour earlier, a 15-year-old boy died after being stabbed in Ashburton Park, in Croydon, in south London. Another 15-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of murder in relation to the Croydon stabbing. Neither victim had been named. Separate murder investigations were launched and police appealed for witnesses to come forward. The 30 killings of teenagers in the capital in the calendar year is the worst death toll on record. The latest stabbings will prompt renewed discussion about the possible causes of youth violence, with experts suggesting these include a rise in the number of children who are vulnerable, increased pressure on services such as policing, and social media fuelling conflict. The seriousness of the situation was further underlined by Pastor Beryl St James, from Shiloh Worship church and charity, which is based in Thornton Heath – near the scene of the first killing. She said she had received a call from a parent who had found a knife in their child’s room on Friday morning. Speaking from the scene, she added: “I know we have to work and we all have duties to fulfil, but as a parent you cannot think that it’s OK to leave the state to continually look after your child.” Anthony King, the chair of the MyEnds programme, which aims to tackle knife crime in London, told reporters at the scene in Croydon: “Sadly, it’s because we’re having a lot of breakdowns in schools, in education, young people are being excluded too quickly, some for minor incidents, there’s breakdown in the homes. “Parents, if you see a bread knife or bun knife missing from the home, please speak to somebody, please contact an agency or an organisation and let the teachers know.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said he was “devastated” by the two deaths. He said: “I refuse to accept that the loss of young lives is inevitable and will continue to be relentless in taking the bold action needed to put an end to violence in our city.” And Commander Alex Murray, Scotland Yard’s lead for violence in London, said: “I am deeply saddened by every single homicide this year, and greatly concerned by those that have been teenage killings. Each one is a tragedy leaving behind heartbroken families and distressed communities. “My thoughts are with the victims and all those impacted. They are not statistics, not just numbers, they all have families, and they all should have had their lives ahead of them. They and their families have been robbed of something precious and we should all be doing everything we can to stop this. “These devastating losses continue to motivate every single officer at the Met to catch those responsible, bring justice to their families and take weapons off the street.” Scotland Yard said police were called to the Croydon stabbing shortly after 7pm. They gave first aid to the boy before the ambulance service arrived, but he was pronounced dead a short time later. Officers were called to the stabbing in Yiewsley shortly after 7.30pm, where they found the 16-year-old victim suffering from a puncture wound. He was also declared dead at the scene. The victims’ family members had been informed but neither boy had been formally identified, Scotland Yard said. Postmortem examinations were due to be held later.",News/UK news,Two more stabbings bring London to its worst ever teenage homicide death toll,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/31/two-more-stabbings-bring-london-to-its-worst-ever-teenage-homicide-death-toll
1/1/2022,"Martin Kettle is right to search for answers to England’s failure in Australia beyond the flaws in Burns’s backlift, but I don’t think it is blinkered complacency, either (English cricket is in disarray. It’s a metaphor for the country, 30 December). For most of the 20th century, two rivers of talent flowed into the county game: one from the club grounds such as Farsley in Yorkshire, which was always home to Ray Illingworth’s heart, the other from the playing fields of independent schools. In the last 40 or 50 years, the latter stream has, perhaps unexpectedly, continued to flow and to deliver, while the former has slowed to a trickle. There are reasons: cricket clubs are no longer central to their communities as they once were; cricket in primary schools is frail and fragmented – despite the best efforts of Chance to Shine – and that means it barely exists in secondary schools.  This is particularly true in inner-city, disadvantaged – and ethnically diverse – areas so that there is rarely a straight or clear road that leads a boy or girl from a child’s enthusiasm to an adult career. How – or whether – any of this can be changed is a question that can’t be answered on your letters page.John ClaughtonOxford University CC 1976-79; Warwickshire CCC, 1979-80; master in charge of cricket, Eton College, 1985-96; chief master, King Edward’s school, Birmingham 2006-16  In his analysis of the state of English cricket, Martin Kettle cites multiple causes, both social and structural, referring to “the pathways to cricket’s renewal and growth” having been “cut off, closed and neglected”. He also alludes to the significant stratum of white upper-middle-class support for the English game. The contrasting place of cricket in youth culture in England and Australia seems relevant here. Until the 1960s, cricket equalled soccer in terms of its heroic figures. As any parent, particularly of boys, of subsequent generations will acknowledge, cricket has been progressively edged to the fringes of youth culture not only by the success of soccer, but because the playing the game is seen to be detrimental to “street cred”. In Australia, cricket not only sits comfortably at the heart of youth culture, it is seen to be positively “rock’n’roll”, the cricket club disco being as good a place to play with one’s rock band as any other venue. Visit any Australian park on a summer’s day and one will witness not only cricket matches of all generations but impromptu games of aspiring youngsters, reminiscent of past scenes in English parks. To bring cricket back to anything approaching its former status would require vision, funding and a monumental effort which, sadly, one feels to be far beyond the capability or ambition of the game’s current administration.Martin AllenShoreham, West Sussex  Martin Kettle’s contextual analysis is a welcome shift from the extensive coverage of the flaws of individual players and the internal organisation of the game. Building on the work of Rowland Bowen and CLR James in looking “beyond a boundary”, two additional points come to mind. First, I think they would have referred to the international context, specifically the role of the International Cricket Council, whose inequitable allocation of funding results in Australia, India and England receiving the greatest share and the largest say over the allocation of fixtures – thus reinforcing divisions between the wealthier and poorer nations. Second, in light of the racism highlighted in the Azeem Rafiq case, they would have regarded it as essential that the England and Wales Cricket Board, in its distribution of funding to counties, leagues and junior cricket, has transparent social inclusion criteria and a way of ensuring their implementation. Perhaps the quote from CLR James, ‘‘What do they know of cricket who only cricket know?’’, should be prominently displayed in players’ dressing rooms and boardooms.Mike SteinPudsey, West Yorkshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/1/2022,"2021 has been quite the year. To call it a dumpster fire would be an insult to dumpster fires. From the 6 January assault on the US Capitol to the emergence of Omicron, it was the year that never failed to disappoint. And yet, there have been glimmers of hope: the miracle of coronavirus vaccines. The miracle of the conviction of a murderous cop, Derek Chauvin. And now, the conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell, 60, who was found “guilty of one of the worst crimes imaginable: facilitating and participating in the sexual abuse of children. Crimes that she committed with her long-time partner and co-conspirator, Jeffrey Epstein,” said Manhattan US attorney Damian Williams.  Chauvin and Maxwell are similar monsters in that they thought they could get away with anything: Chauvin because he was a police officer, a position he had reason to believe would relieve him of any accountability in the killing of an innocent Black man, convictions in such cases being extremely rare. And Maxwell because she was a socialite, a member of the elite, as well as the paramour of a billionaire who was closely connected to other rich and powerful men – notably Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Prince Andrew and the lawyer Alan Dershowitz, whose client list has featured such choir boys as Harvey Weinstein, Trump and Epstein himself. Maxwell had reason to believe she would get away with her crimes, too – Epstein had already been let off easy once before, in 2008, when through a shockingly generous plea deal he was sentenced to just 13 months despite the fact that federal officials had identified 36 underage girls he had allegedly sexually abused. Maxwell knew that the courts often have very different rules for the likes of Epstein and her. She also seemed to think that no one would listen to the four brave women who testified against her – the victims of her crimes, two of whom she had lured into Epstein’s bed when they were just 14 years old. “In her eyes, they were just trash, beneath her,” assistant US attorney Maurene Comey said at the trial. These women didn’t go to Oxford, like Maxwell did, nor did they come from money. But Maxwell’s own pedigree was less than exemplary. When her father, Mirror Group publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell, fell off his yacht and drowned in 1991, there was speculation that it was suicide, or perhaps even that he had been killed by someone who resented the fact that he had allegedly stolen hundreds of millions of pounds from his company’s pension fund. It was all strangely similar to the speculation surrounding the hanging death of Epstein in his prison cell in 2019 before the beginning of his trial for the sex trafficking of minors. Who wanted him silenced before all the sordid details – and all the names – came out at his trial? the Internet buzzed. Just when you thought nothing could be added to the Epstein-Maxwell story to make it even more symptomatic of the rot of our institutions, here come the conspiracy theories. In a surreal sign of the times, there is a parallel mass delusion involving much the same scenario as Maxwell and Epstein’s real-life activities: it’s QAnon, which posits the existence of a secret global child trafficking network run by powerful elites, and which Trump was allegedly trying to stop. This delusion factored into 6 January, when some QAnon believers showed up at the “Stop the Steal” rally, thinking Trump was about to vanquish the cabal. Meanwhile ,Trump had actually been a friend of Epstein and Maxwell’s (“I wish her well,” he said when she was arrested in 2020) and he had been a passenger on the “Lolita Express”, the derisive name members of the media gave to the private plane Epstein used to fly his underage victims to his residences. Other passengers included problematic rich guys Kevin Spacey and Bill Gates. That plane, a luxury Boeing 727, featured private bedrooms and padded floors allegedly designed for sex in flight. It was just one aspect of the lavish lifestyle Maxwell dangled in front of the girls she enticed into having sex with Epstein and her. Maxwell performed the same role as the Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, though decked out in designer goods and proffering clothes and money instead of lollipops. There is a complicated process to grooming, and Maxwell became an expert at it; but tellingly, she mostly just picked girls who came from families that needed money. They were not well-off, like Epstein and she. “Selecting these girls was predatory behavior,” assistant US attorney Alison Moe said in her closing statement. “Maxwell and Epstein picked vulnerable girls. Maxwell was Jeffrey Epstein’s right hand.” A 2020 global study from the United Nations reported that almost two-thirds of people convicted of human trafficking in 2018 were men, although the number of women involved in this crime is higher than others. That’s because women are often used to gain the trust of women and girls, which they can usually do more easily than men. Maxwell is facing up to 65 years in jail for four counts of enticing, transporting and trafficking minors to engage in illegal sex acts and criminal sexual activity. That is, unless she tries to get a shorter sentence by naming names of other people who might have been involved.

1/1/2022,"No sport ushers in the new year free from the worries the pandemic brings but rugby union, perhaps more than most, looks to 2022 with trepidation. The Premiership carries on Saturday with bumper crowds, as was the case for the festive fixtures, but behind the scenes and with the Six Nations looming, key talks are scheduled in the coming days. The government has not yet seen fit to introduce crowd restrictions to sporting events in England – Premiership clubs are likely to lobby for a pause to the season if it does – but that fate has already befallen Scotland and Wales. The Dragons chairman, David Buttress, has described the move as “devastating” and Wales’s first minister, Mark Drakeford, recently admitted he could not say if the restrictions would be lifted by the time of Wales’s first Six Nations home match next month. In Scotland – who host England on the first weekend of the Six Nations – restrictions have been imposed for at least three weeks and a formal review is scheduled for 11 January. Before that, however, it is understood a key meeting is scheduled for next week when organisers are expected to learn whether contingency plans will need to be activated and Covid protocols tightened.  Add in the current plight of the two European competitions – recently postponed fixtures have to be shoehorned into a cluttered calendar while the French government’s rules on travel from the UK threaten the next rounds of fixtures in January – and the situation is all the more precarious. The French government’s insistence that all sportspeople be fully vaccinated by mid-January is just another headache that European officials and Six Nations organisers are grappling with as the new year dawns. Granted, adapting to the challenges posed to cross-border competitions is not an issue limited to rugby union but unlike the Champions League, club rugby is not awash with money. As Bristol’s director of rugby, Pat Lam, recently pointed out, even the cost of chartering a plane only to find the European fixture has been cancelled hits rugby clubs hard. The same goes for cancelling matches – for gate receipts rather than lucrative sponsorship or prize money are the lifeblood – and Bristol forewent around £300,000 after their fixture against the Scarlets was scrapped. That Sale’s Boxing Day trip to Newcastle was called off on Christmas Day only highlights how the Premiership is not immune, as do the 55 positive cases – the second highest on record – produced this week. The optimistic view is that the bullet will be dodged, that crowd restrictions will not be required in England, that they will be lifted soon enough in Scotland and Wales, that teams competing in France will be granted the necessary exemptions and that the Six Nations can go ahead with full crowds. For the unions, the financial impact of having to play the tournament behind closed doors or with strict limits on attendance does not bear thinking about. For supporters and indeed, players it is a similarly desperate prospect. “It would be a huge, huge step backwards if there are no crowds moving forwards for clubs and the Six Nations which is obviously such a showpiece event,” says the Northampton and Wales fly-half Dan Biggar, who last week ran out in front of more than 70,000 fans at Twickenham during Harlequins’ annual Big Game. “You saw it in the autumn, getting crowds back. Everyone coming to games now has to have a passport, they’ll be double or triple-jabbed, and it’s an outdoor event so I don’t see why they wouldn’t be allowed in. As long as it’s safe, that’s the most important thing. “I hope for an event like the Six Nations and for the game up and down the UK moving forward we get some sort of sensible outcome. As long as everyone is safe and jabbed then I think it makes sense to keep crowds in. I think you would have seen a different game [against Harlequins] if the stadium would have been completely empty. “We played a lot of games with no crowds but if you look at the first handful of games they almost felt like training games. It felt like it did not really matter whether you won or lost because it felt like a training match and like the intensity was knocked out of it. You lose any advantage of playing at home and bits and pieces like that. “I think it would be a huge step backwards if crowds were to go. I think the rest of the lads in Wales are pretty frustrated with it. That’s normal frustration isn’t it? We are probably getting into different things with politics now but I think everything should be aligned.” If the new year is also a time to reflect as well as look forward then listen to Biggar and you cannot help but wonder what might have happened had full crowds been allowed for the British & Irish Lions series against South Africa. Rugby union was not without its jaw-dropping moments in 2021 – Harlequins’ Premiership victory is testament to that – but the Lions was supposed to be the showpiece and it barely registers a footnote in any sporting reviews of the year. It has also sparked fierce debate about the quality of the product on the pitch, but Biggar sees a sport moving in the right direction. “With the Lions, if we’d have won the series there might have been some [negative] column inches written still but we would have been celebrating a massive success,” adds Biggar, who lines up for Northampton at Saracens. “One penalty decision either way and there’s a very different slant on it. You look at the way the international game is, defences are a lot tighter, the preparation time you get is always difficult to compare with the club game. “If you look at the way we [Saints] try and play it’s very positive, like Quins. We’re always trying to be positive with the ball. It’s having a balance. There are lots of high scores in the Premiership at the minute, and that’s the way the game is going – you’re going to have to score a lot of points to win, especially in this league. “Gone are the days of accumulating three, six, nine points and then edge a game that way. Week in, week out you are playing against the best players in the world in front of sell-out crowds.” Biggar is not alone in hoping that remains the case in the coming weeks and months.",Sport/Sport,Dan Biggar fears ‘step backwards’ in 2022 if Six Nations sees no crowds,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/31/dan-biggar-fears-step-backwards-if-six-nations-sees-no-crowds-northampton-wales-rugby-union

1/1/2022,"It’s easy, says Laura Barton, for new arrivals to cluster together (I moved to the coast for a better life – now I’m back in London where I belong, 28 December). For most of my life I have lived in rural areas and commuted to London. When I get home I shake off the city and get back to real life. This means chatting over the fence to my neighbour, with whom I have nothing in common, but he’s my neighbour. He doesn’t have regimented tulips (though he does mow his lawn three times a week), but if he did then I would admire the damned things. Then when I go for a coffee with the neighbours who are our friends, I indulge in some gentle mocking of the lawn-mowing. Our hamlet has suddenly become popular, and we welcome our new neighbours if we ever see them on our walks – if they come out from behind the electric gates they put up. They may be just our sort of people, but we’ll never know.

1/1/2022,"As your leader argues (27 December), the platinum jubilee will not only celebrate the Queen’s long reign but also start to raise questions about the next one. After accession, the new sovereign has to make three statutory oaths: to be a true and faithful Protestant; to uphold the Church of Scotland; and to uphold the rights and privileges of the Church of England. In our more secular and pluralist society, these oaths need to be revised and updated. But revision would require fresh legislation, which needs to be passed during the present reign to be in time for the next accession.  Parliament could consider this, as your leader suggests, along with other royal matters, perhaps in a joint committee of both houses. We suggested possible revisions of the oaths in 2018.

1/1/2022,"The number of confirmed Covid cases in the UK continued to rise on the last day of 2021, with a new record of 189,846 reported in the previous 24 hours. It follows two consecutive days when the number of new cases was above 180,000, with 189,213 reported on Thursday and 183,037 on Wednesday – although the latter included a backlog in some nations of cases recorded before and during the Christmas period. Experts said the latest figures are likely to include the first infections arising from people socialising on Christmas Day and Boxing Day.  NHS England also revealed there were 2,370 hospital admissions with Covid in England on 29 December, a 90% week-on-week increase and the highest daily total since 29 January. In the last winter wave, admissions peaked at 4,134 on 12 January. Experts say the daily case figures do not include reinfections and not everyone who is infected has symptoms and takes a test, suggesting the true number of infections is likely to be higher. Friday’s figures reported 203 people having died within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Thursday’s data had 332 recorded deaths, a steep rise from 57 on Wednesday, explained in part by NHS England not reporting hospital deaths since 24 December. The number of Covid patients in hospital in England increased to 12,395 on Friday, from 11,452 the day before. A total of 859 people were in hospital in Scotland with Covid as of Thursday, up from 810 the day before. According to a new estimate on Friday from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), one in 25 people in England had Covid before Christmas, including one in 15 in London. Based on swabs collected from randomly selected households in England, the ONS said an estimated 4% of the community had Covid in the week ending 23 December – equating to about 2,024,700 people.

1/1/2022,"A law banning plastic packaging for large numbers of fruits and vegetables comes into force in France on New Year’s Day, to end what the government has called the “aberration” of overwrapped carrots, apples and bananas, as environmental campaigners and exasperated shoppers urge other countries to do the same. Emmanuel Macron has called the ban on plastic packaging of fresh produce “a real revolution” and said France was taking the lead globally with its law to gradually phase out all single-use plastics by 2040.  Spain will introduce a ban on plastic packaging of fruit and vegetables from 2023. For years, international campaigners have said unnecessary plastic packaging is causing environmental damage and pollution at sea. From New Year’s Day, France will ban supermarkets and other shops from selling cucumbers wrapped in plastic, and peppers, courgettes, aubergines and leeks in plastic packaging. A total of 30 types of fruit and vegetables will be banned from having any plastic wrapping, including bananas, pears, lemons, oranges and kiwis. Packs over 1.5kg will be exempt, as will chopped or processed fruit. Some varieties, including cherry tomatoes or soft fruits such as raspberries and blueberries, will be given longer for producers to find alternatives to plastic, but plastic packaging will be gradually phased out for all whole fruits and vegetables by 2026. With an estimated 37% of fruit and vegetables sold wrapped in plastic packaging in France in 2021, the government believes the ban will cut more than 1bn items of single-use plastic packaging a year. The environment ministry said there must be curbs on the “outrageous amount of single-use plastic in our daily lives”. Fruit and vegetables wrapped in layers of plastic have exasperated consumers not only in France but neighbouring countries. Nearly three-quarters of British people have experienced “anxiety, frustration or hopelessness” at the amount of plastic that comes with their shopping and 59% think supermarkets and brands are not doing enough to offer refillable, reusable or packaging-free products, according to a poll commissioned by Friends of the Earth and City to Sea in June. An Ifop poll for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) France in 2019 found that 85% of people were in favour of banning single-use plastic products and packaging. More than 2 million people have signed a WWF petition calling on world governments to stop the plastics pollution crisis. In angry posts on social media, shoppers have complained of what they deemed absurd wrapping such as coconuts in several layers of plastic or single bananas in individual plastic bags. Moïra Tourneur, an advocacy manager at the NGO Zero Waste France, said the French law was a “good and appropriate” move, although she questioned what she called the “surprising” list of exempt fruit and vegetables given a longer transition time of at least another year before going plastic-free. These include brussels sprouts, spring onions, green beans, broccoli, mushrooms, peaches and apricots, some of which are already sold loose in many shops. Tourneur said: “The ban is fair and fitting … Giving more time for certain fruit and vegetables is a bit of a shame. There is a climate emergency. People are conscious of the need to act urgently on this issue.” WWF France, which has campaigned on the impact of plastics on biodiversity and marine life in the Mediterranean and across oceans, said it was important to welcome the law as “a positive step in the right direction”, while reminding governments there was more work to be done to end plastics pollution, including on microplastics. Pierre Cannet, its director of advocacy and campaigns, said the law sent a positive message and “puts plastics at the heart of the national debate”. He added: “We need to stay humble and vigilant by saying there is still a lot to do. We’re still very far from an economy without plastic, and from all the steps needed to eradicate plastics pollution.” Camilla Zerr, a plastics campaigner at Friends of the Earth for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said: “I think it’s a very good approach and I would hugely urge the UK to be doing the same and not to lag behind.” She said that in the UK fruit such as bananas or apples wrapped in plastic packages were sometimes cheaper than those sold loose, which was “very problematic”. Zerr added: “It is interesting to note that in the UK the main brands sell fruit and vegetables wrapped, but at corner stores you can find a lot of loose fruit and vegetables on sale, which proves it is possible to go without plastic.”",News/World news,That’s a wrap: French plastic packaging ban for fruit and veg begins,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/thats-a-wrap-french-plastic-packaging-ban-for-fruit-and-veg-begins
1/1/2022,"The Ghislaine Maxwell case raises so many questions, and yet scarcely discussed is the one that perhaps matters most. Naturally, there’s huge interest in whether Maxwell, convicted this week of recruiting and grooming teenage girls for sex with her one-time boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein, will seek to reduce her sentence by naming names – opening up the pair’s notorious little black book and telling prosecutors who else among the rich and powerful abused the vulnerable minors Maxwell trafficked for sex. In Britain, much of that interest focuses on Epstein’s longtime pal, Prince Andrew, who was so close to the couple he invited them on visits to Balmoral, Sandringham and Windsor: it’s lucky the prince doesn’t sweat, because if he did, he might be drenched now. So far he has refused to answer US investigators’ questions – not for his own sake, you understand, but according to multiple reports, to save the Queen from embarrassment. Because a 61-year-old man hiding behind his 95-year-old mother would not be in the least bit mortifying.  There are other questions, such as: how many others enabled the travelling child abuse ring that Epstein and Maxwell operated, turning a blind eye to what was surely obvious? Or: when else would the BBC respond to the conviction of a child sex offender by interviewing a brother of the offender who refused to accept the verdict of the court? And how come that Today programme interview with Ian Maxwell came so soon after the BBC had given a platform to one of Epstein’s lawyers, presenting him as if he were merely a neutral expert? All those questions matter, and yet the one that preys on my mind is more timeless. It’s the question that arises in all such cases of human cruelty yet which one hesitates to ask, lest the inquiry seem naive: why? The coverage of Maxwell has probed that a bit, suggesting for example that Ghislaine Maxwell was conditioned, as the daughter of the publishing magnate Robert Maxwell, to cater to the whims of a monstrous man, and simply transferred her allegiance, and her service, from one monster to another. Growing up surrounded by wealth and power, where the deference of officialdom was taken for granted, would have had its effect too. Ghislaine Maxwell may well have assumed that people like her and Epstein were granted a special kind of impunity, that they could break the laws that restrained the appetites of lesser mortals, because for most of her life that had indeed been the case. And yet, both those answers are unsatisfying as explanations. There are plenty of abusers who did not grow up with either a Maxwell-style father or Maxwell-level wealth and, conversely, there are people whose upbringings were comparable to Ghislaine Maxwell’s but who did not go on to commit terrible crimes. So the why question lingers, just as it did in sharper and more horrific form at least twice in the last month alone. December 2021 began with convictions for the father and stepmother of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes in a case so appalling, I confess at the time I could barely read accounts of it. The six-year-old was subjected to a regime of sustained torture which was, incredibly, filmed by those who inflicted it. The little boy was made to stand in isolation for up to 14 hours at a time, without anything to eat or drink. He was beaten. To punish him, his father took the football shirts he loved and cut them to shreds in front of him. Perhaps most unbearable of all, the jury was shown footage of a weak and frail Arthur shortly before his death saying: “No one loves me. No one is going to feed me.” When the man and woman guilty of destroying Arthur’s brief life were found guilty, there was revulsion, of course – and on Friday their sentences were referred to the court of appeal for being too lenient – but the public conversation moved without pause for breath to the policy implications. There was intense debate about the state of children’s services, about the damage done by austerity, about target-driven culture, about the recruitment and retention of social workers and so on. But what was missing was a much less sophisticated question. Why would two people do such terrible things to a defenceless child? How could a father cause such pain to his own flesh and blood? There was a similar reflex 11 days later, following the verdicts in the equally soul-draining case of Star Hobson, a child, a baby really, who died at just 16 months, having been punched to death by her mother’s partner as her mother did nothing to save her. Once again, the pair filmed their months of cruelty against the little girl, apparently finding the videos amusing enough to send to friends. And yet the immediate talk was not of how two people could do such a thing, but of a local “child safeguarding practice review” and whether control of children’s services should belong with the local council or the Department for Education. I understand the impulse to concentrate on these institutional, bureaucratic issues. The assumption is that there will always be people capable of horrendous brutality, that that fact will never change, and so the sensible focus of our attention should be on prevention. I get that. And yet the sheer speed with which we move to technocratic answers, barely even asking the harder human questions, begins to look like displacement activity. It’s as if we can’t bring ourselves to contemplate the puzzle of what humans are capable of, because we have no idea what we’d say. Earlier, God-fearing generations did not find this so difficult. Nor do those who still have traditional faith. They have recourse to a vocabulary that includes the notion of evil and wickedness and that allows them to talk about it. But those words don’t trip so easily off the secular tongue. Instead, we look for explanations in psychology or economics, assuming, to adapt Stephen Sondheim’s lyric, that if people are depraved it’s because they’re deprived, whether of love or money. That view persists. There was an echo of it in the closing argument from Maxwell’s defence lawyer, when she asked “why an Oxford-educated, proper English woman would suddenly agree to facilitate sex abuse of minors”. Only the poor or poorly educated behave badly. We can see the flaw in such reasoning, even before you get to the insult it delivers to all those who endured great privation, emotional or material, without becoming abusers. And yet, the absence of easy answers does not give us a licence to stop asking hard questions. We need to be able to stare wicked acts and evil deeds in the face, rather than to comfort ourselves that they exist solely as functions of failed systems, errors that could be eliminated given the right policy tweak. This need not be a bleak endeavour. I think of Julie K Brown, the Miami Herald reporter without whose fearless pursuit of Epstein’s crimes this week’s reckoning might never have come. I think of the courage of the victims, who kept up the fight for justice at great cost. Unfathomable evil is part of the human story, but so too is unimaginable good.

1/1/2022,"UK regulators have approved Pfizer’s “life-saving” antiviral drug Paxlovid, which boasts nearly 90% success in preventing severe illness among vulnerable adults if taken soon after becoming infected with Covid-19. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found the oral treatment “to be safe and effective at reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death in people with mild to moderate Covid-19 infection, who are at an increased risk of developing severe disease”.  The agency said Paxlovid was most effective when taken during the early stages of a Covid infection, and recommended it was used within five days of a patient’s first symptoms. The approval is for patients aged 18 and over with at least one risk factor for developing severe illness, such as obesity or diabetes, or being over 60. Dr June Raine, the MHRA’s chief executive, said: “We now have a further antiviral medicine for the treatment of Covid-19 that can be taken by mouth rather than administered intravenously. This means it can be administered outside a hospital setting, before Covid-19 has progressed to a severe stage. “I hope the announcement gives reassurance to those particularly vulnerable to Covid-19, for whom this treatment has been approved. For these individuals, this treatment could be life-saving.” Before Christmas Pfizer said the UK government had agreed to purchase 2.5m courses of Paxlovid after an earlier purchase of 250,000 doses, conditional on regulatory approval. The MHRA noted that Paxlovid was “not a substitute for vaccination”, and said vaccines and boosters remained the best way to avoid being hospitalised because of Covid. Pfizer has said the drug showed near 90% efficacy in preventing hospitalisations and deaths in high-risk patients, with recent data suggesting the pill was also effective against the Omicron variant. In a clinical trial involving high-risk adults with Covid, Paxlovid reduced the rate of severe illness by 89% compared with a placebo group. Just three out of 389 patients were hospitalised or died from Covid-19 after taking the drug within three days of symptoms, compared with 27 out of 385 in the placebo group. Scientists said Paxlovid worked through protease inhibitors, which prevent a virus from replicating. These were similar to those used to treat HIV, making it beneficial for patients with weak immune systems. The two parts of Paxlovid, nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332) and ritonavir, are taken together, twice a day for five days. PF-07321332 is a new antiviral, while ritonavir – which slows the breakdown of PF-07321332 within the liver to increase its effectiveness – is already used alongside HIV medications. However, ritonavir can interfere with the functioning of other drugs through the liver, meaning Paxlovid may not be offered if patients cannot pause existing courses of medication. Prof Munir Pirmohamed, the chair of the MHRA’s commission on human medicines, said its coronavirus expert working group had endorsed the agency’s approval of Paxlovid, calling it “another safe and effective treatment” against Covid-19. “As it is deployed, we will monitor its effectiveness and safety in the real world, including any drug interactions, as we do with all medicines,” he said. The MHRA has already approved an antiviral pill, molnupiravir, made by Merck. But its results have been disappointing and it may be only about 30% effective in preventing hospitalisation. There have also been concerns raised over molnupiravir’s potential to lead to further variants.",News/World news,UK medicines regulator approves Pfizer’s ‘life-saving’ Covid pill,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/uk-medicines-regulator-approves-pfizers-life-saving-covid-pill-paxlovid
