HR The Man in the White Suit (Alexander Mackendrick, 1951) 1pm, BBC TwoThere’s a distinct touch of Jesus to Alec Guinness in this brilliant 1951 Ealing satire. His wide-eyed, unworldly scientist, Sidney, invents a cloth that never gets dirty and lasts for ever. Of course, this will not do, as the textile industry would become defunct, so an unholy alliance of capital and labour races to prevent him bringing it to the public. Master director Alexander Mackendrick sets the scene with a lightness that belies the tragic beating down of Sidney’s creative impulses – from the musical plops and parps of his lab apparatus to Joan Greenwood’s mellifluous turn as the factory owner’s daughter.

2/25/2022,"The New South Wales Liberal division will have another month to solve its deadlock on selecting candidates for the federal election and hold an annual general meeting – but it is still possible that the federal division could step in next week. Matthew Camenzuli, a member of the NSW state executive of the Liberal party, has won his case in the supreme court, which means the state executive remains validly elected until at least 28 March.  The chief justice of the equity division of the NSW supreme court, Julie Ward, ruled that the state branch’s constitution should be interpreted as allowing the state executive to remain in place even though it has not held an annual general meeting. She said she had concluded “(with some hesitation) that the natural meaning of the words ‘until the next AGM’ is premised on such an AGM occurring”. “If an AGM does not occur, then the event on which the termination of office will happen has not arisen and the elected office-bearer continues in office until such time as an AGM is held,” she said. The case was in response to legal advice presented to state executive last week that said if it did not hold an annual meeting by the end of February the division would be in breach of its constitution. This prompted talk of federal intervention, and raised fears that the situation was being used in order to influence preselections. Whether the extra month will help the party solve its preselection impasse is unclear. With just a few weeks until the federal election is likely declared, it is still an option for the federal executive of the party to intervene when it meets on 3 March. Meanwhile, there were small signs this week that the preselection process was moving forward. After months of failing to convene because the federal immigration minister, Alex Hawke, the prime minister’s representative, was unavailable, the nominations review committee met this week to vet some candidates. The state executive had also agreed that a preselection by way of a branch plebiscite for the seat of Bennelong, in Sydney’s north, would go ahead on 23 March. The Senate spots would also go to a vote of the Liberal party council. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, was likely to retain top spot on the ticket, while senators Concetta Fierravanti-Wells and Jim Molan and two other nominees would be contesting the other winnable position. This was scheduled for 27 March, on the eve of the planned AGM of the council. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The rest of the contentious preselections would again be discussed on Friday night at the scheduled meeting of the NSW state executive. In advance of the meeting the NSW president, Philip Ruddock, advanced a compromise position, which would involve the three sitting members – immigration minister Alex Hawke in Mitchell, environment minister Sussan Ley in Farrer and MP Trent Zimmerman in North Sydney – being automatically re-endorsed by the state executive. This was being voted on via a remote ballot on Friday afternoon. This could leave open the potential for preselections via plebiscites in Hughes, Warringah, Dobell and Parramatta, but even this concession may not be sufficient to placate a vocal group on state executive – said to be between four and seven – who want the Liberal party to abide by its constitution and hold branch votes in all seats. To use special power to bypass preselections, Ruddock would need 90% of the 28-strong state executive to agree.

Under the plan, notice periods would be shortened to allow all preselections to be completed within four to five weeks. Weary factional organisers said there was some likelihood this course would be supported by the state executive tonight – but that may be only to provoke federal intervention. Branch votes in all seats would almost certainly be unacceptable to the prime minister, who would likely lose Ley, one of his few women in cabinet, as well as factional ally Hawke, as they face increasing challenges from the right. The federal division will meet on 3 March and has warned that further delays could trigger intervention. This could range from a full-scale takeover of the state branch’s affairs, by effectively appointing an administrator, or taking control of preselections. Such a move would likely end in the courts.",News/Australia news,Reprieve for NSW Liberal party as court ruling provides a month to sort out preselections,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/25/reprieve-for-nsw-liberal-party-as-court-ruling-provides-a-month-to-sort-out-preselections
2/25/2022,"Hundreds of world leaders will come together online and in Nairobi, Kenya, next week, in what is described as a “critical moment” in progress towards the first ever global treaty to combat plastic waste. Inger Andersen, director of the UN Environment Programme, said an agreement at the UN environment assembly could be the most important multilateral pact since the Paris climate accord in 2015. Public disgust and impatience over the growing mountain of plastic waste has led to an unprecedented “degree of focus” that could see member states agreeing a blueprint for a legally binding treaty to control plastics “from source to sea”, she said.  “Public impatience is something that is very powerful,” Andersen told the Guardian. “The public has had enough. We are all dependent on plastic, but they obviously want to see some resolution of this issue.” Earlier this month, the US, which generates more plastic waste per person than any other country in the world, joined with France in calling for a global agreement that recognises “the importance of curbing [plastic waste] at its source.” A key goal of the fifth UN environment assembly, from 28 February to 2 March, is to thrash out broad terms for a global agreement on plastic pollution and to form an intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) to broker a final deal. If member states can agree on a framework, the INC would then negotiate a final treaty to be signed. Only 9% of plastic waste is recycled. It is difficult to recycle, slow to decay, expensive and polluting to burn, and breaks down into tiny particles that enter the food chain and cause harm to animals. These microplastics are ubiquitous, from the deep seafloor to the Arctic ice pack. Addressing delegates on Wednesday, ahead of the summit, Andersen said: “The world is watching with anxiety but also with hope – because for the first time in history, we are seeing unprecedented global momentum to tackle the plague of plastic pollution.” “From the 1950s to today, we have produced around 9bn tonnes, and 7bn tonnes of that is waste,” said Andersen. “That waste doesn’t disappear. We may feel good when we put it into the recycling bin, but it doesn’t all get recycled … 76% ends up in landfills and then the rest is incinerated, which causes toxic emissions as well as carbon dioxide.” If the UN does not agree on a treaty to curb production and use of plastic, ocean plastic pollution could quadruple by 2050 and there will be widespread ecological damage, according to a WWF report earlier this month. Reducing use of plastic, made from oil and gas, has implications for the climate as well as pollution levels, Andersen said. “If we manage to land it [an agreement], it will be the biggest thing we have done as a global community in a new multilateral environment agreement. We haven’t dealt with this issue with this degree of focus before. It is a very significant moment, and it is absolutely critical.” This week, negotiators in Nairobi are looking at two main resolutions, one from Rwanda and Peru, which addresses the full lifecycle of plastics and has the backing of more than 70 countries, including 27 from the EU. The other, from Japan, backed by Cambodia, Palau and Sri Lanka, prioritises waste management interventions and limits its scope to marine litter. More than 300 scientists and research organisations are calling on all UN member states to accept nothing less than the key elements of the stronger Rwanda-Peru resolution. And 90 business leaders, including fast-moving consumer goods companies, key producers of plastic waste, have also called for an agreement. Andersen’s wishlist for the agreement is that it covers the whole lifecycle of plastic, not just marine litter, includes monitoring and targets, and has a financial element, to help developing countries less able to recycle. “What’s interesting is that 90 CEOs have signed up, calling for a legally binding agreement. That includes PepsiCo and Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble and Unilever. And then you ask, ‘Well, why?’ Because [of] shareholders and consumers, that’s where the lever is. There are many, many more who want to see that shift.”",News/Environment,"Plastic summit could be most important green deal since Paris accords, says UN",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/25/plastic-summit-could-be-most-important-green-deal-since-paris-accords-says-un
2/25/2022,"We were warned about Vladimir Putin – about his intentions, his nature, his mindset – and, because it was profitable for us, we ignored those warnings and welcomed his friends and their money. It is too late for us to erase our responsibility for helping Putin build his system. But we can still dismantle it and stop it coming back. Russia is a mafia state, and its elite exists to enrich itself. Democracy is an existential threat to that theft, which is why Putin has crushed it at home and seeks to undermine it abroad. For decades, London has been the most important place not only for Russia’s criminal elite to launder its money, but also for it to stash its wealth. We have been the Kremlin’s bankers, and provided its elite with the financial skills it lacks. Its kleptocracy could not exist without our assistance. The best time to do something about this was 30 years ago – but the second best time is right now.  We journalists have long been writing about this, but it is not simply overheated rhetoric from overexcited hacks. Parliament’s intelligence and security committee wrote two years ago that our investigative agencies are underfunded, our economy is awash with dirty money, and oligarchs have bought influence at the very top of our society. The committee heard evidence from senior law enforcement and security officials. It laid out detailed, careful suggestions for what Britain should do to limit the damage Putin has already done to our society. Instead of learning from the report and implementing its proposals, Boris Johnson delayed its publication until after the general election and then, when further delay became impossible, dismissed those who took its sober analysis seriously as “Islingtonian remainers” seeking to delegitimise Brexit. That is the crucial context for Johnson’s ludicrous claim this week to the House of Commons that no government could “conceivably be doing more to root out corrupt Russian money”. That is not only demonstrably untrue, it is an inversion of reality. On leaving the European Union, we were told that we could launch our own independent sanctions regime – and this week we saw the fruit of it: a response markedly weaker than those of Brussels and Washington. The Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, speaking with parliamentary privilege on Tuesday, listed the names of 35 alleged key Putin “enablers” whom the Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has asked to be sanctioned. Blocking the assets of everyone on that list and their close relatives would be a truly significant response from Johnson to the gravity of the situation. But it would still only be a start. Relying solely on sanctions now is like stamping on a car’s accelerator when you’ve failed for years to maintain the engine, pump up the tyres or fill up the tank, yet still expect it to hit 95mph. Other announcements in the last couple of days have amounted to nothing more than painting on go-faster stripes. Tackling the UK’s role in enabling Putin’s kleptocracy, and containing the threat his allies pose to democracy here and elsewhere, will require far more than just banning golden visas or Kremlin TV stations. For a start, we need to know who owns our country. Some 87,000 properties in England and Wales are owned via offshore companies – which prevents us seeing who their true owners are or if they were bought with criminal money. Companies House makes no checks on registrations, which is why UK shell structures have featured in most Russian money-laundering scandals. Imposing transparency on the ownership of dirty money in this way would strike at the heart of the London money-laundering machine. Governments have promised to do this “when parliamentary time allows” for years, yet the time has never been found, and instead they’ve listened to concerns from the City that such regulations would harm its competitiveness. Above all, we need to fund our enforcement agencies as generously as oligarchs fund their lawyers: you can’t fight grand corruption on the cheap. Even good policies of recent years, such as the “unexplained wealth orders” of 2017, which were designed to tackle criminally owned assets hidden behind clever shell structures, have largely failed because investigators lack the funds to use them. We must spend what it takes to drive kleptocratic cash out of the country. Johnson is not the first prime minister to fail to rise to the challenge – Tony Blair and David Cameron both schmoozed with Putin even when it was obvious what kind of a leader he was. And I don’t think Johnson is personally corrupt or tainted by Russian money; he’s lazy, flippant and unwilling to launch expensive, laborious initiatives that will bring results only long after he himself has left office and is unable to take the credit for them. It is time, however, for his colleagues to step up and force him into action. This is a serious moment, and it requires serious people willing to invest in the long-term security of our country and the future of democracy everywhere.

2/25/2022,"For those of you who have not had the pleasure of watching the six seasons of History’s Vikings (not history’s Vikings – they’re only loosely affiliated with the show), let me bring you up to speed before we turn to the new spin-off, Vikings: Valhalla (Netflix). Vikings was 89 episodes about Vikings. The main Viking was the legendary hero of the Norse sagas and eventually king Ragnar Lodbrok (Travis Fimmel). Vikings started in 793 (or 2013 out here in the watching world), with the Viking raid on Lindisfarne and marauded through the schedules for a couple of generations’ worth of Vikings and seven of our years. It was a simplified Game of Thrones, a Nordic – which is to say a less utterly demented – The Tudors (another production by Vikings creator Michael Hirst) – designed to trouble the mental capacities of no one, though it doubtless caused medieval scholars significant pain. At various points it starred Gabriel Byrne, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and – as I believe is statutorily mandated for all Scandinavia-based productions – a Skarsgård; in this case Gustaf, son of Stellan, brother of Alexander.  Vikings: Valhalla is also about Vikings. We pick up about a hundred years after we and Ragnar left off, with the St Brice’s Day massacre. King Aethelred (Bosco Hogan), not so Unready on 13 November 1002, orders the slaughter of every Dane in England in retaliation for their fellow Norsemen’s propensity for raiding his kingdom over the preceding years. King Canute (Bradley Freegard) immediately starts gathering a vengeful Viking army at Kattegat and prepares to go to war, aided by Harald Sigurdsson (Leo Suter) – AKA Harald Hardrada, and you may want to keep an eye on him, because Vikings: Valhalla is going to take us all the way up to the Battle of Stamford Bridge – and, ideally, Olaf “the Holy” Haraldsson (Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson). Two problems: one, Olaf is now a zealous Christian and won’t fight alongside his pagan countrymen. Two, I’m not entirely sure who anyone is because they are all just moving masses of beard and animal skins. Olaf is the largest – OK. Canute is the handsomest – fine. And Harald is sporting a manbun that, even at a distance of 1,000 years, is upsetting but at least a working identifier as long as he’s facing away from camera. When he’s not, he is indistinguishable from Leif Eriksson (Sam Corlett). Eriksson is a real history Viking – the son of Erik the Red, and an explorer who is thought to have beaten Christopher Columbus to North America by about 500 years – but here we know him first as the leader of a group of Greenlanders who have arrived at Kattegat to avenge the rape of his sister Freydis (Frida Gustavsson, a great performance that throws others into sharp relief) by an unknown Christian and just at the wrong time not to be caught up in a war they have little interest in. Freydis was also a real Viking, and quite the marauder in her own right – if we get to nominate a spin-off to the spin-off, Freydis Takes Valhalla gets my vote. It’s fun, no more, no less. Bit of history, bit of gore, bit of sex, bit of plot, lots of hair. As mindless distraction at a gruelling time, it will be hard to beat.

Josie Long’s voice is a perfect accompaniment to the topic at hand, and she never fails to seem invested in hearing more. The smooth montage of people sharing their experiences with crushes had me smiling, cringing and nodding along in agreement. Parts two and three work nicely to help change your mind on the power of love, and the ending seems like a sort of recorded therapy session that the listener is let in on. You do feel that you’re overhearing a special moment between exes, unscripted, and real. Did it leave me feeling anything different about the concept of love?

2/25/2022,"Brompton has revealed plans to invest as much as £100m in a new UK factory that will secure its place as the UK’s biggest bicycle manufacturer. In an added twist it has decided to reject the normal grey shed, instead opting to build its plant on stilts amid a newly restored wetland. The folding bike maker plans for the new site at Ashford in Kent to be open by 2027, on a 40 hectare (100 acre) floodplain. The stilts will be needed to prevent the factory being regularly inundated. It will also have no new car parking, instead relying on new pedestrian and cycle paths from the train station.  “The whole reason this works is everything about it is slightly mad,” said Will Butler-Adams, Brompton’s chief executive, speaking before the plans were approved by Ashford borough council’s cabinet on Thursday evening. It is part of an expansion that will increase employee numbers from 850 to 1,000 in the next year. Butler-Adams said Brompton will also develop new products at the site, with an ultimate goal of building 200,000 bikes a year, compared with just shy of 70,000 in the year to March 2021, when Brompton made revenues of £76m (including a bike subscription service in some cities). The company will move from a “nondescript great big grey box” in Greenford in west London to a custom-built facility that will also host a museum, visitor centre and café, Butler-Adams said. Brompton hopes the facility, designed by architect Guy Hollaway, will be distinctive enough to attract a small portion of the 4.5m annual visitors to the designer outlet next door. The Greenford factory will continue to operate until at least 2030 during a transition to the new site. Part of the plan will involve restoring the new area to something similar to what it would be without human intervention: 24 hectares will be dedicated to a “rewilded public nature reserve” with a cycle path and trails open to the public. The cost of the factory will be as much as 50% higher than building a new shed-style factory, Butler-Adams said. However, he hopes it will save money in the longer term and avoid competing for shed space against booming online retailers. The company will also be able to spend on energy-saving measures such as insulation, ground source heat pumps and solar panels on its roof. Brompton has a net zero carbon emissions “ambition”, and so will aim to use materials with a lower carbon footprint. The factory will not include the usual expanse of tarmac for car parking (beyond a few spaces for disabled employees). Instead, workers will be able walk or cycle directly along 4km of new paths from Ashford International station. Those workers who do drive will have to use existing parking around Ashford, possibly in the nearby shopping centres. Hollaway, the architect, has also designed Ashford’s upcoming Newtown Works project, as well as galleries, a winery for English vintners Chapel Down, and even a multi-storey skatepark. Hollaway said he wanted the Brompton building to ask, “what is the factory of the future?” The complex – with floor-to-ceiling windows around much of the circular main building, according to digital renders – is designed to celebrate manufacturing and inspire workers, Butler-Adams said. “So much manufacturing is in some industrial estate hidden away, and nobody sees it,” he said. “It’s like an abattoir. It’s hidden. “We want to turn normal upside down and redefine manufacturing. Everyone thinks it’s dark satanic mills and people with boilersuits and monkey wrenches. It’s not.” In the shorter term Brompton is still coping with pandemic supply shortages, shipping delays of up to a month to add to normal 10-week lead time, and disruption caused by Brexit. Butler-Adams said he thought they were “over the worst of it” on supply issues. “The Brexit situation has been a bit of a nightmare – that’s improving,” he added. Brompton is sitting on an £11m cash pile, and it has not raised external capital in the 20 years Butler-Adams has been with the business. He said he would prefer not to raise new capital unless required, but added it would not be difficult if necessary. When Brompton started talks with Ashford, the council had initially put forward the site that eventually became a vast lorry park to cope with extra Brexit customs checks. The council will provide undisclosed financial support for the new factory. The Ashford site offers easy access to and from London, with its millions of commuters and potential Brompton customers, but Butler-Adams said the proximity of the Eurostar station would also allow the company to “engage with Europe really easily”.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Brompton Bikes plans £100m wetland factory on stilts,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/25/brompton-bikes-plans-100m-wetland-factory-on-stilts
2/25/2022,"They have been a feature of London’s streets for nearly 12 years: the docked public bikes for sharing that are billed as one of the easiest and quickest ways for people to make shorter journeys. Or in some cases, it seems, considerably longer ones. Among the hundreds of bikes that go permanently missing from the 14,000-plus fleet every year, a handful have been tracked down to distinctly non-London locations, including Australia, the Gambia and Turkey, a freedom of information request has disclosed.  Other foreign locations in which the bikes have been officially spotted are Jamaica, Romania and the Republic of Ireland. According to the FoI response from Transport for London (TfL), which operates the Santander Cycles scheme, the rogue Irish bike was recovered with the help of garda officers, while the British Transport Police has helped to bring back models from Cornwall, Southend-on-Sea and Brighton. There was no news about the fate of the others. TfL is reluctant to discuss the theft of what many still refer to as “Boris bikes” after the London mayor in office at the time they were introduced, even though the scheme originated from Boris Johnson’s predecessor, Ken Livingstone. While the London hire scheme is seen as a huge success, recording its 100 millionth journey just over a year ago, the number of bikes lost permanently is gradually rising, albeit from a total number that has more than doubled since it was launched. In 2013, the first year records are available, 108 bikes went missing – this rose to 950 bikes in 2020 and 851 in the first seven months of last year. TfL declined to give further details about the particularly exotic places in which some bikes were found, beyond to say that they were identified through a mixture of reports from the public, social media and GPS. From the start of 2020, TfL has trialled GPS tracking for some of the bikes as a way of reducing overall theft numbers. However, details about some of the examples have previously emerged. Footage from Jamaica showing one of the bikes, in the red livery of Santander – the bank that sponsors the scheme, has been widely shared on social media in recent weeks. The example from the Gambia appears to be a much earlier case. In 2013, a staff member from the charity Oxfam in the west African country took a photo of one of the bikes, in the blue colours of then sponsor Barclays, being ridden down a dirt road. There was speculation that the bike could have been donated but it was unclear. Theft and vandalism have created a significant barrier to other bike share schemes in the UK, particularly companies that offered dockless bikes that could be left on the pavement or street after a ride. In 2018, the Chinese firm Mobike pulled out of Manchester because of what it called “unsustainable” losses from theft and vandalism. It has since ceased all UK operations, but for wider commercial reasons. In contrast, the TfL scheme requires customers to take bikes from fixed docking points, using either membership or a bank card, and charges up to £300 if a bike is not returned. The scheme has proved increasingly popular, in part due to the construction of more cycling infrastructure around London, but also, more recently, because of people avoiding public transport due to Covid. The system reported a record number of 10.9m hires in 2021. David Eddington, TfL’s head of cycle hire, said: “We take cycle theft extremely seriously and are taking measures to deter it, including installing GPS trackers on bikes, installing cameras at select docking stations and checking equipment at docking stations to ensure bikes are returned properly.”",News/UK news,Going the distance: the ‘Boris bikes’ being spotted around the world,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/25/going-the-distance-the-boris-bikes-being-spotted-around-the-world
2/25/2022,"We like to think of wood burning as a climate neutral source of energy. This has led to subsidised wood burning for electricity generation and is part of the appeal of an evening around a roaring fire. This idea relies on the carbon released from wood burning being reabsorbed by forests and woodland. Reality is more complex. Firstly, it takes time for new forests to regrow and absorb the carbon. For large-scale wood burning for power generation using wood imported from North America, it can take decades or perhaps more than a century for forests to reabsorb this additional carbon from our air. This means greater chances of irreversible climate tipping points before any possible benefits accrue.  Secondly, for the same amount of heat or energy, burning wood releases more carbon dioxide than oil or gas. This means more carbon in the air immediately after burning wood for electricity compared with fossil fuels, and more carbon in the air after an evening in front of the wood fire than using the central heating. This extra carbon has to be absorbed by new tree growth before we can even talk about neutrality. David van der Spoel from the group Skydda Skogen (Protect the Forest Sweden) said: “Bioenergy aggravates the climate crisis. Instead, we have to move away from burning anything that generates greenhouse gases.” Wood for home burning is sometimes locally sourced. A study in Finland showed that the impact of home heating on forests, and the time needed for carbon to be reabsorbed, depended on the type of wood used; for example, forest waste, small branches or felling mature trees. However, it concluded that wood heating was the least climate friendly option for Finnish homes. A French study has looked at ways to meet a rapid increase in demand for wood energy. These included cutting old forests or chopping down trees before they are fully grown. All options would reduce carbon stored in forests and reduce the total capacity of the nation’s forests as a carbon sink; meaning more carbon in the atmosphere, not less, for several decades to come. Danish and Australian research highlights that home wood burning also produces methane. This is a powerful global heating gas and further skews the balance away from climate neutrality. Wood burning produces soot too, which adds to blackening of arctic snow and increases melt rates. Comparisons between the climate impacts of wood heating and alternatives are even worse if we compare it with heat pumps run by wind or other carbon neutral energy. Studies on supply chains are urgently needed to fully understand the impacts of home wood heating on our climate, woodlands and biodiversity. However, it is clear that the best way to reduce the climate impacts of home heating is to leave trees growing in the forest and invest in insulation and true low or zero carbon energy.",News/Environment,"Pollutionwatch: wood fires are bad for planet, more evidence shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/25/pollutionwatch-wood-fires-bad-for-planet-more-evidence-shows

2/25/2022,"Courts in Singapore will next week consider arguments by four men who have spent more than a decade on death row, amid fears the city state may push ahead with executions to free up space on death row. The Singaporean government does not disclose how many people are held on death row, though campaigners believe there are likely more than 50 men awaiting execution, the majority of whom have been convicted of drug offences.  Singapore has not carried out any executions for the past two years, due to a number of pending court applications that forced the authorities to pause proceedings. However, sentences of the death penalty have continued to be handed down, even during the height of the pandemic when hearings were held over Zoom. Families fear there is now a backlog that the authorities are attempting to clear. Among the cases to be heard next week, is an appeal launched by Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam, whose execution was stayed last year pending appeal. Nagaenthran, who has an intellectual disability, was convicted of trying to smuggle 43 grams – about three tablespoons – of heroin into Singapore. The handling of his case provoked global outrage, with UN experts, the European Union’s delegation to Singapore, as well as multiple rights groups and billionaire Richard Branson, a critic of the death penalty, all expressing concern. I am calling on Singapore’s President Halimah Yacob to grant clemency and spare Nagaenthran Dharmalingam’s life https://t.co/4tHmc78wLF #SaveNagaenthran #SaveNaga Since then, other inmates – Roslan bin Bakar, Pausi bin Jefridin and Rosman bin Abdullah – have been scheduled for execution. These were temporarily halted, but further hearings in their case are scheduled for next week. Kirsten Han, a journalist and activist who has written extensively about Singapore’s death penalty, said families of other inmates on death row are following the proceedings anxiously. “How these recent cases go is taken as an indication of whether their cases might be coming soon. They are all very worried,” she said. Nagaenthran’s sister, Sarmila Dharmalingam, who lives in Malaysia, said she will wait anxiously for a phone call on Tuesday to hear of her brother’s fate. Sarmila said her brother’s mood is unpredictable, and that for two years during the pandemic he refused to meet relatives, they suspect due to depression. “Sometimes Nagaen will talk nicely to my brother [who is now permanently based in Singapore], and then suddenly he will switch off, [start] looking up and down. The character is different,” she said. Sarmila last spoke to Nagaenthran three weeks ago. He asked her why she was busy campaigning and helping organise his appeal. “I am speechless that Nagaen was asking me these questions,” she said. “I ask, ‘Why? You don’t know for what purpose I am doing this? I already informed you that I want to save your life.” It is unclear if he understands the situation. According to Han’s research, more than 50 people are on death row, including a disproportionate number of ethnic minority inmates. Singapore has some of the world’s toughest drug laws, which its government claims are the most effective deterrent against crime. Campaigners argue this is not the case. “Statistics from countries that have abolished the death penalty show that the absence of the death penalty has not resulted in an increase in the crimes previously subject to capital punishment,” said Chiara Sangiorgio, death penalty adviser at Amnesty International, who pointed to data from Canada. The Singapore government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In 2012, a legal change granted Singaporean judges narrow discretion to sentence convicts to life imprisonment and possible caning if certain criteria are met. Individuals must prove they were acting only as a courier, and must obtain a certificate of substantive assistance, confirming that they had provided information that significantly helped disrupt drug trafficking activities, or prove they have a mental or intellectual disability that substantially impaired their mental responsibility. Yet inmates who appear to meet such criteria struggle to have this accepted by the courts, including Nagaenthran, whose various psychiatric conditions were not recognised. Pannir Selvam Pranthaman, who was found guilty of carrying 51.84g of heroin in 2017, was also refused such an allowance. His lawyer argued he had given information to the authorities which led to the arrest of another drug trafficker. However, the court said this information confirmed what the authorities had already known and so, while accurate, wasn’t useful enough to warrant a certificate. Pannir’s sister, Angelia Pranthaman, who campaigns on behalf of her brother and other death row inmates, said her brother has exhausted all forms of legal challenge. Their only option is to ask for clemency. “We have no hope in clemency,” she said, adding that no pardon has been issued for decades. “I am very scared of the word because that is the last option we have.” Han said that while the public is supportive of the death penalty, it is becoming more open to discussing the issue. Recent high profile cases may, for many, be the first time they have discovered how the death penalty works, she said. Reforms though, are likely to take time, said Han, which is little comfort to the families of those awaiting execution. “If someone is scheduled to hang next week I can’t possibly tell his family – oh, you know, change takes time and the death penalty will be abolished in 10 years, because they really don’t care about that.”",News/World news,Singapore courts set to consider executions amid fears authorities want to clear backlog,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/singapore-courts-set-to-consider-executions-amid-fears-authorities-want-to-clear-backlog
2/25/2022,"If the protesters in front of New Zealand’s parliament have anything in common, it is a self-professed opposition to “Covid vaccination mandates”. These, they say, are an unacceptable burden on the individual rights of those who choose not to be vaccinated and so must be abolished immediately. These protesters are correct about one thing. Although the various mandates, which mean around 40% of New Zealand’s workforce face losing their jobs if not vaccinated, are not strictly compulsory in the sense of making it an offence to not be jabbed, they do limit individual rights. Specifically, the right to refuse to undergo any medical treatment, as guaranteed by section 11 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.  However, noting that vaccination mandates limit a right is the easy part. The more difficult task is assessing whether that limit is, in the words of the Bill of Rights Act, a “demonstrably justified limit in a free and democratic society”. If it is so justified, then imposing it is a legitimate governmental choice in legal terms. Such an approach makes intuitive sense. Imagine a person with a virulent form of tuberculosis that could be cured with antibiotics, but who won’t accept that treatment. It would be a kind of collective madness to say that they must remain free to mingle in society and spread the disease just because forcing them into quarantine limits their right to refuse medical treatment. Equally, imposing costs on those who refuse, for whatever reason, to accept Covid vaccination is justifiable if doing so advances public health goals in a proportionate way. That assessment is, at its core, a balancing one between the importance of the right and the reasons for limiting it. Three high court judges have so far been called upon to make exactly this assessment when hearing challenges to vaccine mandate requirements brought by unvaccinated border workers, teachers and healthcare professionals. In each case, after reviewing the evidence presented by both vaccine opponents and the government, the court ruled that the policy is justified. However, in one case late last year a judicial warning did sound, with the court suggesting that whether a measure would remain justified might change when the virus became endemic. That is because justifying a rights limit is very much a contextual matter. It asks not “are all vaccine mandates always justifiable?”, but rather “is this particular vaccine mandate justifiable in these circumstances?” On Friday, the high court answered that question in the negative in a decision overturning a vaccine mandate for all police and defence workers. Although the government argued the measure was needed to ensure these services could continue to operate in a Covid environment, the court found that no real evidence had been presented to show this was the case. Merely asserting that mandatory vaccinations are intended to combat Covid and its effects is not enough, by itself, to justify the rights limits involved. The government must rather demonstrate that the policy actually can achieve the asserted goal. Consequently, as different variants of the virus emerge and levels of infection increase, the balance between the right and the reasons for limiting it also shifts. For this reason, it’s entirely appropriate to ask whether existing mandate rules still serve important public health purposes given the emergence of the Omicron variant and widespread community cases. However, in addressing that question we should be careful to check our collective headspace. Two years into life under Covid, many New Zealanders understandably are growing sick of its strictures. We all look forward to the return of something like the old normal. And so there’s a temptation to play armchair epidemiologist and search out selective evidence that apparently supports a rapid undoing of existing rules. That temptation really needs to be resisted. We will only get one chance to get the shift away from vaccine mandates and other Covid controls right. Those calling for an immediate end to vaccine mandates, be they outside parliament or elsewhere, won’t then have to bear any responsibility for the consequences of doing so. It is those who actually have control of our laws that will have to carry that can. Act too fast, and their mistake will be measured in funerals and lengthy stays in hospital that deny treatment to others. Act too slowly, and some individuals already suffering a limit on their rights will have to do so for a few more weeks or months than otherwise. Ultimately, that is the calculus public health officials and ministers are facing. And so, it perhaps is not surprising that they appear to be choosing to answer it cautiously.
