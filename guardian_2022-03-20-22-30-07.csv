3/20/2022,"When the Barbican last paid tribute to his orchestral music, in 1983, Frank Zappa declared it a disaster. He hated the venue’s acoustics, demanded that the orchestra be rigorously split up to assist the mixing process, criticised conductor Kent Nagano, accused the London Symphony Orchestra’s members of being drunk, and claimed they made hundreds of errors. And that was a performance that received a 20-minute standing ovation, which suggests that the notoriously perfectionist Zappa might have been his own worst critic. We often view rock stars who dabble in the classical world in the same way we might a dog walking on its hind legs, but Zappa was composing for orchestras long before he made rock albums. As well as containing plenty of sly references to his 20th-century modernist heroes, Zappa’s densely written scores often sound like a dozen different film soundtracks playing concurrently: Carl Stalling’s chaotic cartoon scores set alongside slurring Bollywood violins; Psycho strings mixed with Gershwin-style romanticism; spooky spy-movie woodwind versus thunderous car-chase percussion. This all-day celebration started with a screening of Alex Winter’s excellent 2020 Zappa documentary and featured a Q&A with Zappa biographer Ben Watson (punctuated by a suitably Dada-esque supporting cast of musicians on rattles, bells and typewriters, planted among the audience). It concluded with an evening show at the Barbican Hall featuring 90 members of the BBC Symphony Orchestra: this Mahler-sized ensemble required an enlarged stage that subsumed the auditorium’s first six rows of seats, and its sheer size enabled it to lurch from pianissimo to deafening, percussion-heavy fortissimo. This suited works like Pedro’s Dowry and Bob In Dacron, where short themes develop as they are thrown from one part of the orchestra to another (only the final piece, the 6/8 ballad Strictly Genteel, moved into dreary classical rock bombast). But the highlight of the day might have been the afternoon concert at the smaller Milton Court, where young Guildhall students in the Ubu Ensemble worked through excerpts from Zappa’s last orchestral work, The Yellow Shark, from 1993. Even alongside some intriguing obscurities by his idols Stravinsky, Webern and Varèse, Zappa’s witty, impressionistic, jazz-flecked miniatures more than held their own. The BBC Symphony Orchestra concert is available online.

3/20/2022,"A group of 50 orphans evacuated from Ukraine by a charity established by Scottish football fans will arrive in the UK on Monday. After drying tears for abandoned teddy bears and navigating the demands of international bureaucracy, the children would be “welcomed with open arms”, said Steven Carr, chairman of the Edinburgh-based charity Dnipro Kids. He flew to Ukraine several weeks ago to oversee the evacuation of the children, who are aged between two and 17, from the city of Dnipro to Poland, where they have been staying in a hotel in Poznan and supported by local refugee organisations. Priti Patel, the home secretary, announced last Friday that Ukrainian authorities had confirmed the group would be able to continue their journey to the UK. Duncan MacRae, media manager for the charity, said the weekend had been used to finalise paperwork with the British embassy team from Warsaw. Speaking from Poznan, MacRae explained: “It’s a very complex operation and every time you think you have things sorted, something else becomes unsorted.” The children were enjoying the play area in the hotel, he said, and staff had organised other activities such as ten-pin bowling and watching movies. The charity began in 2005, when a group of Hibernian FC fans travelled to Dnipro for a UEFA Cup game and organised a collection for local orphans. Within a year, Dnipro Kids had been officially launched back in Edinburgh, raising £16,000 in donations from supporters. In the intervening seven years, the charity has supported six “orphanages” – family-style accommodation for children whose parents have died or who are otherwise unable to care for them because of mental illness, physical disability or addiction. The youngsters remain in good spirits, MacRae said, and are finding the international media interest in their journey “funny and a bit bizarre”. Their “house mothers” are understandably more anxious: “I don’t think they’ll relax until we are all on the plane.” There are plans to keep the group together initially, and they will spend their first few weeks in the Scottish countryside near Callander. The charity has arranged for Ukranian-speaking child psychologists and art therapists to be on hand once the group reach their temporary sanctuary, while children in a local primary school in Edinburgh have been making cards explaining how to adapt to life in Scotland. The group will be accompanied back to the UK by Ian Blackford, the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, who urged the deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, to intervene in their case at last week’s prime minister’s questions, accusing Home Office bureaucracy of leaving them stranded. An initial group of children and young people made a 13-hour journey on crowded trains from central Ukraine to Lviv as the bombardment of their city began two weeks ago, before travelling across the border to Poland. They were later joined by another group who were evacuated by bus. The children were allowed to take one backpack each, containing clothes, toiletries and precious toys. “One little girl had a collection of teddy bears, but she could only bring one small one. She was crying in the night, worried about the other bears. We called a friend still in Dnipro and they went back to the house to pick them up, so now she knows they are safe.”",News/World news,Ukraine orphans evacuated by Scottish football fans’ charity to travel to UK,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/ukraine-orphans-evacuated-scottish-football-fans-charity-dnipro-kids-travel-uk
3/20/2022,"It’s eight years since the Irish writer Colin Barrett made a splash with his debut story collection, Young Skins, whose standout piece, Calm With Horses, about an ex-boxer working as the muscle for a grudge-bearing drug dealer, was turned into a well-received film of the same name. Homesickness is another finely crafted collection, again set largely on Barrett’s home turf of County Mayo, portrayed once more as a cauldron of alarming violence and simmering disappointment.Crisply told, fond of an eye-catching flourish (pint glasses “honeycombed” on a pub table; a “sudsy” blowjob), the stories draw energy from the rhythms of west of Ireland small talk, added to Barrett’s eye for striking detail: witness the music leaking from the headphones of a gunshot victim in the opening story, or the barman who explains that his sunburnt neck is the result of falling asleep on his mother’s roof while listening to a mixedmartial arts podcast.The Alps starts with the pub banter of three burly brothers but shifts gear when one of them returns from the gents, having “thrummed a sulphurous piss into the gurgling trough”, to find a sword-wielding stranger named Derek has joined the drinkers. Barrett plays the situation for off-kilter laughs as well as peril; a similar left turn animates Anhedonia, Here I Come, about a self-regarding poet who, out to buy weed from his regular dealer (a camogie-playing schoolgirl about to go straight), finds himself propositioned by a fellow customer, a man carrying a baby girl in a sling.The scenarios are richly layered, with punchy payoffs. The Low, Shimmering Black Drone, about an unpublished writer paid to look after a novelist’s dogs during lockdown, is a smart bit of post-pandemic fiction that manages to send up the clamour for such a thing without compromising its emotional force. Barrett has any number of cute exit strategies: a story involving a delinquent school pupil ends with him falling asleep in front of a video game blinking “Do you want to continue?”, while the one about the gunshot victim ends with a cop reviewing her notes to write up the report of what we’ve just seen. Barrett is hardly shy of explosive drama, but he’s just as interested in how life plods on in the face of adversity. Where he truly excels is in his ability to condense the richness of family saga into just a couple of dozen pages, as in The 10, about a young car salesman, Danny, living in the shadow of his disappointment at being let go by Manchester United as a teenager. Probably the best football-related fiction since Ross Raisin’s A Natural, it deftly portrays the desires and disappointments of a range of characters in Danny’s orbit, including the widowed sister of the girl he’s seeing, and his older brother, left using a wheelchair since a childhood car accident. Barrett’s opening lines tend to be are-you-sitting-comfortably? scene-setters: “Eileen watched the bus pull into the depot and the passengers debark, stiff and groggy, into the crisp November air, their breaths flashing like handkerchiefs in front of their faces.” A more ambiguous note is struck by the openings to the equally excellent stories in Wendy Erskine’s Dance Move, another follow-up to a celebrated debut collection (2019’s Sweet Home). These Belfast tales set us wondering from the off about who, where, when and why. Try, for instance: “It actually only takes the taxi ten minutes to get there from the hotel.” Or: “Even on the morning of his wedding Lee texted her, because it was the allotted day” – the start of a paragraph that can only be understood once we reread the story it introduces. Relationships in these stories are often opaquely troubling: in Mathematics, a cleaner named Roberta shoplifts vital supplies to care for the small girl she discovers abandoned in one of the properties she cleans for her exploitative landlord. There’s a great deal of sadness, not least in His Mother, about a woman removing the missing person posters she put up for her dead son, but there’s also surreal comedy, even in the book’s uglier moments: see Nostalgie, in which a faded English singer-songwriter who had a hit single in the 80s gets booked out of the blue for a private post-retirement gig driven, he discovers, by a paramilitary group’s unlikely love for its B-side. Memento Mori, the most stunning piece here, brings everything in Erskine’s formidable repertoire together for maximal impact. Her fondness for wrongfooting the reader gains force once it becomes clear where the protagonist, Gillian, shown taking mindfulness classes, actually is at the time of telling. The story turns on a doorstep killing that takes place with improbable timing right outside her home as she’s caring for her terminally ill partner, Tracey; it’s easily powerful enough on its own terms, yet there’s an unmistakable satirical force, too, in how the story pits the imperatives of public commemoration against the needs of private grief. Daring, funny, heartbreaking and, like everything else here, out and out entertainment, not to be missed. Homesickness by Colin Barrett is published by Jonathan Cape (£14.99).

3/20/2022,"Ten years ago on Monday, Judith Tebbutt walked onto a plane and out of the hands of the Somali pirates, kidnappers and murderers who had held her captive for almost seven months. Her husband, David, had been shot dead by Tebbutt’s initial captors when they burst into the couple’s bedroom in their isolated, luxury holiday resort. It was the dead of night and David, a finance director for the publishing house Faber & Faber, wrestled with one of the gunmen as they dragged Judith away: there were marks on his arms where he had attempted to fight them off. He was shot in the chest and died instantly. The couple had been together for more than three decades. Over the next seven months, Judith, then aged 56, was passed from pirate band to pirate band. She recalls the daily torture her captors subjected her to. She was starved – she weighed eight stone before her abduction and just five and a half afterwards – humiliated, and repeatedly subjected to mind games. One day her captors would tell her she was about to go home, that there was a plane waiting for her, and the next day that she was going to be murdered because the ransom money hadn’t arrived, or abandoned to die in the forest. “This was every day,” she said. “When I was released, I was at the stage where I just didn’t know what to believe. When I finally got in the plane and it landed, I was met by government officials and I remember looking at this woman and trying to work out whether she was real. I actually said to her: ‘Are you real?’” Tebbutt’s release was thanks to her 25-year-old son, Ollie, who, with the help of a private security firm, negotiated a ransom with the kidnappers. “He grew up overnight,” said Tebbutt, her pride, awe and sadness still evident a decade later. Tebbutt watched the homecoming of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe last week with joy mixed with trepidation. “She’s got such a wonderful future ahead of her but she needs to take time,” she says. “If I could go back 10 years, I would tell myself to just take it easy: don’t rush into things, don’t make any major decisions for at least six months. Tell your story to the people who you want to tell your story to because you need to tell your story but don’t feel pressurised by anyone. “This is your life that you’ve got back, so you need to navigate and orchestrate how you want to to be and how you want to move forward because people do move forward,” she adds. Moving forward, however, is hard work, she warns. “What’s happened has happened. You can’t go back. You can’t change the past,” she says. “You’ve just got to keep putting one foot in front of the other. “That’s exactly what I did when I was in captivity: exercising my body in the dark holes they kept me in, and keeping my mind active too. And that’s what I’ve been doing the last 10 years, in a different way, and that’s what Nazanin and her family will do too, and gradually over time, the trauma and the pain of it will become manageable.” Tebbutt said that although some might expect Zaghari-Radcliffe to slip back into normal life with relative ease, she knows from experiences that it is not that simple. “When you’re in captivity, you yearn for freedom but when I finally had my freedom, the future seemed really dark,” she says. “I didn’t know how I was going to get through it. But I did. I had my family and good people around me, but it was really hard work just rediscovering myself.” Tebbutt said she couldn’t have recovered without Hostage International, a charity that provides a support network and to specialist care, free of charge, to those affected by kidnapping or arbitrary detention outside their home country. Founded in 2004 by former hostage Terry Waite CBE and a group of former hostages and family members, the independent charity has supported more than 370 cases – – around 30 each year, Zaghari-Ratcliffe among them. “I spoke frequently to Nazanin online when she was under house arrest at her parents’ home,” said Waite. “I was astounded that I was able to – that’s never happened before in all my time helping hostages – but she and I were able to spend lots of time talking and I did what I could to help her stay strong and maintain hope.” Tebbutt says that even with the help of Hostage International, it took her at least five years after her release to begin recovering. “Before that, I was constantly trying to pretend I was OK,” she says. “David and I had a great life together and great retirement planned out: our life was like a little jigsaw puzzle with the pieces all in the right place – and then someone came along and just threw the pieces everywhere. For years, it felt like I was looking for pieces of David. “But I don’t need to look for those pieces any more,” she says, sitting straighter in her chair and shaking the hair out of her face. “I’m OK being me as a widow and me as a former hostage. It doesn’t define me any more. I’m just Jude. Moving forward, walking forward all the time.”",News/UK news,‘It was hard rediscovering myself’: Judith Tebbutt on escaping Somali kidnappers,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/20/it-was-hard-rediscovering-myself-judith-tebbutt-on-escaping-somali-kidnappers
3/20/2022,"What is it that makes some wines popular and others beyond the pale? For example, during the 2010s the southern French dry white picpoul de pinet became a must-have for every supermarket and wine bar. It was often sold as the Languedoc’s answer to muscadet. And yet, while picpoul can be perfectly nice in a clean, doesn’t touch the sides, refreshing with seafood sort of way, and reasonably priced, it’s never exactly thrilling. Muscadet itself, meanwhile, can be awful: painfully tart, sour and mean, a fact that may account for its loss of popularity since it was a staple of wine lists in the 1970s and 80s. But the good bottles are so much more exciting than the rows of quite good picpoul; at their saline, yeasty, lemony best (Jean-François Baron Muscadet Sèvre et Maine Sur Lie 2020; £11.25, yapp.co.uk) they are an economical alternative to chablis. They’d be at the top of any list I might draw up of “neglected wines I wish people drank more of”. The rest of the list is dominated by fallen European giants: once-popular styles nudged out of fashion by the boom in New World wine, or that remain tainted with memories of bad wines past. You might put German riesling in the latter category. The often-thrilling dry and off-dry wines of today, with their spine-tingling flash of silvery acidity, are nothing like the sweet sugar-water liebfraumilchs of yesteryear. Next would be beaujolais: the complex and gluggable best of the region – including the new generation of beaujolais nouveau – is in a different league to the bubblegum and banana-scented stuff remembered from cross-Channel booze cruises. Although these wines might have lost their places in the mainstream they have a small but growing cult audience among wine geeks. The same is true for another once all-conquering bestseller, sherry, which has been unpopular enough for the past 40 years to be absurdly cheap and for which I’m a vociferous, bordering-on-tedious evangelist, much like every other wine professional I know. Other styles that deserve a wider audience come from regions that have never really been popular with anyone apart from the locals. There is so much to enjoy in the indigenous varieties and distinctive flavours emerging from the modern scenes in Portugal, Greece, Slovenia and Croatia. But if I were to pick out the single, currently neglected wine that I reckon would add the most pleasure to people’s lives if only they’d try it, it wouldn’t be a specific region or grape variety: it’s a whole genre, encompassing such glittering golden gems as sauternes, barsac, tokaji, monbazillac, coteaux du layon, icewine or eiswein and the German and Austrian rieslings known as trockenbeerenauslese. I wish more people gave themselves the chance to experience the heady, luxurious delights of the world’s great dessert wines. Williams & Humbert Alegria Manzanilla Spain NV (£5.49, 37.5cl, Waitrose) Perennially on the brink of a comeback, but never coming close to its 20th-century sales heyday, sherry is absurdly good value. This is an example of the lightest, raciest style from estuarine Sanlúcar, a crisp, fresh, nutty, yeasty and salty match for seafood. M&S Classics Mineralstein Riesling Pfalz, Germany 2020 (£9.50, Marks & Spencer) Riesling is a flexible grape variety, capable of making everything from austerely dry to full-on lusiciously sweet, but the best examples always have a spine of invigorating steely acidity, plus, as is the case here, some mouthwatering lime skin tanginess and tropical fruit fleshiness. Domaines des Forges Côteaux du Layon Chaume Loire, France 2018 (£10.78, 37.5cl, justerinis.com; laywheeler.com) An example of two things the world needs more of: the great white grape variety chenin blanc, and golden dessert wines that are luscious yet balanced with scintillating acidity, this is a simply gorgeous partner for strong hard or blue cheese. Terra d’Alter ALF Alfrocheiro Alentejo, Portugal 2020 (from £10.95, leaandsandeman.co.uk; butlers-winecellar.co.uk; flagshipwines.co.uk) Portugal is arguably still best known in the UK for its peerless fortified wines: port and madeira. The 21st century has seen a renaissance of the country’s table wines, with this juicy, brambly fruited, supple southern red from the native alfrocheiro variety just brilliant value. Oenops Wines Apla White Drama, Greece 2020 (£12.88, laywheeler.com) Greece is an absolutetrove of distinctive wine that has never quite made it over the line into mainstream acceptance in the UK. This typically lemon grove-fragrant, floral, zippy white blend of malagouzia, assyrtiko, roditis and muscat is the perfect introduction. Francesco Rinaldi Dolcetto d’Alba Roussot Piedmont, Italy 2020 (from £15.95, thewhiskyexchange.com; handford.net; noblegreenwines.co.uk) Italy’s answer to Beaujolais is the Piemontese red wine made from dolcetto. Like its French counterpart it used to be much more popular in the UK and the examples from top modern producers such as Rinaldi are a big improvement on the past: all vibrant vivid dark cherry, herbs and freshness.",Lifestyle/Food,The unloved wines I wish we drank more often,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/20/the-unloved-wines-i-wish-we-drank-more-often-beaujolais-muscadet
3/20/2022,"The swift success of 19-year-old Brighton rapper ArrDee in the past year comes during a breakthrough wave of UK drill into the mainstream pop charts – even Ed Sheeran has a drill song now. ArrDee’s success is arguably at least in part down to his being a more “palatable” (read: white, TikTok-savvy) face in an otherwise unfairly vilified genre (the police remove a huge number of drill videos from YouTube every year). Sitting on that poppier end of drill, ArrDee’s breakout feature on Tion Wayne and Russ Millions’ Body remix went viral, and since then he’s become known for his cheeky bars about partying, girls and grafting. This debut mixtape leans into the crude bravado, with lines like “She wanna suck it ’cos I’m sweet like some smarties”, though there are softer moments too (on Early Hours he recounts connecting with someone new late into the night, until the birds are chirping outside). The production sometimes relies too heavily on obvious sampling, but the tape still pulses with a carefree, bass-y heat, with licks of horn, Spanish guitar and internet-ready hooks.

3/20/2022,"Civilians fleeing conflict in Ukraine must be given immediate access to mental health support when they reach the UK, experts have said, adding there is an urgent need for more investment in such services. Jonathan Bisson, professor in psychiatry at Cardiff University and director of Traumatic Stress Wales, said many people remaining in Ukraine would be experiencing uncertainty, anxiety and fear and some were likely develop mental health problems. “Depending on where you are in Ukraine, at the moment you may be experiencing, absolutely catastrophic, direct, traumatic events occurring: loss of homes, having no electricity, no water, deaths of people around you, being injured yourself,” he said. “And if that’s not happening to you, or your town, or where you live at the moment, then clearly there must be a major fear that that will happen in the near future.” While Bisson stressed such feelings were normal, and should not be pathologised, he said some people were likely go on to develop mental health problems. An important approach to reduce this risk, he added, was ensuring people felt supported during the crisis. But Bisson said short-, medium- and long-term mental health services were also crucial for those who had fled Ukraine, noting many refugees would require emotional support straight away once they arrived in countries like the UK. “Any response right from the word go, needs to be trauma informed,” he said. But Bisson said that in the first instance that meant ensuring people fleeing conflict had safety and stability. “Establishing people in communities, getting community support, establishing good social networks for people and with people – these are absolutely fundamental to people’s longer term prospects in terms of their mental health and wellbeing,” he said. Bisson said therapy for conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder was usually best offered once individuals were settled and had stability, meaning provision may be needed months or years after their arrival. Dr Noreen Tehrani, a chartered member of the British Psychological Society and a member of its crisis, disaster and trauma section, also stressed the importance of ensuring refugees felt safe, adding that placing them in families, rather than refugee camps, would hopefully make this easier. But Tehrani raised concerns about a lack of specialist support. “There is the concern that lots of well-meaning but untrained counsellors and other kind people will want to help, but for refugees with a high level of trauma it is possible to do more harm when you don’t understand exactly what is needed,” she said, adding there was also a need for safeguarding and an awareness of the risks to women and children. Tehrani said it would also be helpful for information to be provided to services including schools, GPs, youth organisations and people who were offering homes to the refugees so they knew what to expect. Kama Petruczenko, policy and research officer at the Refugee Council, also pointed to the need for support both for refugees and for those who want to help them. “There is an urgent need for more investment in mental health support for refugees,” she said. “Two-thirds of people seeking asylum experience serious mental distress, and they are five times more likely to have mental health needs than the UK population.” She added: “The extremely traumatised women and children who arrive from Ukraine will need significant professional support to come to terms with all they have endured. The government needs to ensure sponsors are able to access appropriate levels of support and training to support the complex needs of Ukrainian families who have lost so much.” Petruczenko said it was hugely important that immediate help and also longer-term support were available. “The government says additional resources will be made available, but it’s important this funding is at the right level to meet needs as soon as people start to arrive,” she said. Dr Adrian James, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, also called for action. “It’s absolutely critical that we help refugees to recover from the trauma they’ve experienced, and that we identify those in need of additional specialist mental health support. The government must also urgently focus on improving conditions for refugees, including increasing access to mental health support.” A government spokesperson said: “Ukrainians fleeing their home country will be guaranteed free access to NHS healthcare, including mental health care services and registration with a GP. “Arrivals will be signposted to services including 24/7 mental health helplines available in every area, and information on accessing NHS services including talking therapies.”",News/Society,"Prioritise mental health support for Ukrainians arriving in UK, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/20/mental-health-support-ukrainians-refugees-uk
3/20/2022,"Cigarette in one hand, paintbrush in the other: David Hockney’s latest self-portrait is as original as ever. He wears a suit of three-colour tweed, what’s more, just to complicate the depiction of the material world. The picture hangs at the door of Hockney’s Eye at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, and it is the wittiest of welcomes. For only one eye is clearly visible behind a pair of jaunty yellow specs. Hockney will be 85 in July and this feels like an early celebration, a party to which all ages are welcome. Its theme – and Hockney’s enduring obsession – is the great conundrum of how to represent the three-dimensional world in two dimensions. It runs all the way from shadows and silhouettes to vanishing points, linear perspective and the infinite calculus of dots, dabs, lines, colours, tones and hues that make up an image. And that is before his theories about optical devices. Paintings and drawings by Hockney are interspersed with the Fitzwilliam’s old masters; they also overflow into the Heong Gallery at nearby Downing College. Actual devices, antique and modern, are also included. Anyone who wants to know the exact difference between the camera obscura and the camera lucida, for instance, will be very clear (so to speak) by the end. A real camera obscura has even been created in a tent on the Fitzwilliam lawn, turning the sights of Cambridge upside down. The Hockneys are presented through the galleries in various ways. Here is a standalone acrylic of a beach brolly casting shadows on the sand, shadows more dramatic and colourful than the umbrella’s stripes. It isolates the lessons of impressionism. A mesmerising multiscreen road movie through the winter woods of Hockney’s native Yorkshire appears alongside a snow scene by Camille Pissarro, each concerned in part with the colours of snow and the way it adheres to the skeleton of bare trees. Appearing among the Dutch golden age paintings are some of Hockney’s recent iPad drawings of flowers. The Dutch still lifes of roses and fritillaries might not have the glow of backlit animation, of course, unlike Hockney’s garish blossoms, ceaselessly morphing through his games with graphic notation on digital screens. But the idea is that all the artists in this gallery are doing the same thing, giving lasting life to nature’s ephemeral blooms. Ars longa, vita brevis, whatever the era. The National Gallery has lent one of its greatest Dutch paintings for this show: Meindert Hobbema’s The Avenue at Middelharnis. Two lines of towering trees zoom towards a distant vanishing point beneath high Dutch skies. It is a lightning strike of geometry, symmetry and sheer verticality, dizzying to behold. Hockney takes it all apart, alongside, in a deconstruction that opens out the skies and surrounding landscape into hexagonal flaps (think of the flattening out of a cardboard box). His painting is called After Hobbema (Useful Knowledge) and that subtitle goes straight to the point; he is analysing the ways in which Hobbema orders the way we see the scene in his masterpiece. Quite apart from its weird shape, Hockney’s diagram is worked in his familiar palette of hot pink, burning orange and lime green. You could hardly call it reprise or emulation. Green marks a path through the galleries. Wherever you see a bright burst, on panel or wall, there you will find a Hockney. And there are more at the Heong Gallery, including photographic collages, computer drawings and one of his vast eye-popping acrylics of the Grand Canyon. Technology has always been Hockney’s metier, from Polaroid, fax and photocopy to computer and iPad; it would be hard to think of another artist who has been more versatile with his media. And Hockney has for decades argued that it was the same for his predecessors. How did Jean-Auguste-Dominque Ingres achieve such stupendous accuracy of likeness in his one-hour pencil portraits, for instance? By using a camera lucida, according to Hockney. You can see one of these devices for projecting images onto paper in the Fitzwilliam show; and you can see Ingres’s portraits alongside others by Hockney, in which he deliberately uses this device. The agility of Ingres’s draughtsmanship amazes, the line so lithe and spare in all its descriptive acuity; and it is the same with the Hockneys. But scepticism about the camera lucida theory – no such aid was found among Ingres’s possessions, nobody mentions seeing him use one – has a pleasing corollary in the images themselves. Ingres is superbly consistent; Hockney is not. His drawings of Alan Bennett, Ian McKellen and other members of the national treasury are remarkably varied, ranging all the way from old master virtuosity to near cartoon. It is not the technology, nor even the eye, but the mind itself that determines the art. This point is beautifully made in a group of glass cases that includes John Sell Cotman’s perspective drawings for teaching students at King’s College London in the 1830s. They are instructively concise, all angles and lines, yet each is breaking into a kind of ethereal equipoise closer to mystery. And William Blake’s spectacles – the glass touchingly dirty on the right lens, perhaps where his hand habitually went to remove them – are of course optical devices like all the others in the exhibition. But next to these glasses lie Blake’s mystical inner visions, as remote from Hockney’s eyeballing theories as can be. This sequence forms a captivating show within the show. Of course Hockney is alive to all this. His visual presence in the museum feels sociable and affectionate, rather than competitive. Which is just as well, since his recent responses to Fra Angelico, for instance, are wilfully reductive and gaudy, more interested in architecture than human souls. He wishes we would look harder at other people’s faces, claims that the camera made us shadow-conscious, jokes that his iPad drawings at least keep the flowers fresh. There is a touch of as-told-to conversation in the captions. Obviously this is a Hockney retrospective by other means, no matter how dispersed through the museum and nearby gallery. Portraits in pencil, paint and stylus, landscapes of Yorkshire, France and Colorado, Californian sketches from the 1960s and 1970s of dazzling facility: all are set forth beside the old masters.

3/20/2022,"The Bank of England’s message to Rishi Sunak was simple. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is the latest unwelcome shock to the UK economy. It will make people poorer. There is nothing we, the Bank, can do about it. So, over to you, Chancellor. Threadneedle Street is absolutely right. It doesn’t have the tools to respond to rising global commodity prices but the Treasury does. Sunak has all sorts of ways of alleviating the pain: cutting taxes, increasing benefits, reducing excise duties, helping out with energy bills. And although the original intention was not to turn Wednesday’s spring statement into a mini-budget, recent events mean that is what it needs to become. Unless Sunak wants to go down in history as the new Philip Snowden – the Labour chancellor who cut benefits during the Great Depression – he will need to come up with something meaningful. Sunak says he is “done” with tax increases and has sympathy with people struggling to make ends meet. He needs to convert words into action because this is how things look. Inflationary pressure was growing even before Vladimir Putin decided to invade Ukraine, because as the global economy started to emerge from lockdown the supply of basic commodities – such as oil – struggled to keep pace with demand. Both companies and consumers are affected by rising inflation. Businesses that have to pay higher costs for fuel and raw materials have a choice: try to pass on the costs to their customers or take a hit on their profit margins. Consumers face a similar problem. If it costs more to fill up the car with petrol or heat their home, they can either try to secure pay increases that keep pace with inflation, cut spending on non-essential items, or rack up debt. It is not hard to see how things will play out in the coming months. Companies will initially seek to pass on their higher costs to their customers, but won’t be able to make the price increases stick when consumers are belt-tightening. As any A-level student of economics knows, national output – or gross domestic product – is consumer spending plus investment plus government spending plus exports net of imports. Consumer spending is going to be weak this year because wages will fail to keep pace with prices. Companies are going to mothball investment as the costs of doing business go up. The chances of an export-led boom are nil given that every other energy-importing country faces exactly the same pressures as the UK. That leaves the government, where policy is currently the opposite of what it needs to be. Sunak has frozen tax allowances for the rest of the parliament; he will raise employer and employee national insurance contributions by 1.25 percentage points from next month; and he has temporarily scrapped the pensions triple lock. Taken together, these measures will suck tens of billions of pounds out of the economy at precisely the wrong time. The Treasury has a dual function. It is primarily a ministry of finance with a ministry of the economy tacked on. During the early stages of the pandemic the finance ministry element took a rare back seat because there was an obvious need to spend money to prevent the economy collapsing during lockdown. Now that the pandemic is perceived to be over – even if there appears to be a sting in the tail – the Treasury has reverted to its normal way of working, with reducing public borrowing the main aim. That mindset needs to change. It is not as if Sunak hasn’t been warned. The Bank of England was already forecasting the biggest squeeze on living standards since modern records began three decades ago, and says the impact of the invasion of Ukraine will make the situation “materially’ worse. Number crunching by the chartered accountant and political economist Richard Murphy suggests the hit to living standards will be extremely painful: a 14% hit for someone on the minimum wage, 11% for someone on median earnings. “For half UK households it’s very hard to see how they have any chance of making ends meet without significant government support,” Murphy says. “This is not just disastrous for them, it also signals that a recession is very likely unless Sunak takes action now. Delay would make it almost impossible to prevent a massive downturn happening.” It’s hard to disagree with Murphy’s conclusion. As things stand, Britain is heading for a monster recession and time is running out to take evasive action. It is clear that after fighting and winning a battle with Boris Johnson, Sunak is not going to scrap or even postpone the increase in NICs, even though going ahead with them now is an act of economic self-harm. But the chancellor dropped enough hints on his Sunday morning TV appearances to make it clear he will announce some additional help this week. Fuel duty looks certain to be slashed and there may be a temptation to shoot Labour’s fox by announcing a temporary cut in VAT on domestic energy bills. Either measures would have the effect of increasing spending power and reducing the annual inflation rate. Sunak announced a package of support for households with their energy bills early last month and that already seems inadequate. The Treasury is, though, resistant to making it more generous until it is clear what will happen to the energy price cap when it is next revisited in October. That leaves state benefits, which are due to rise by 3.1% next month – about five percentage points below the likely rate of inflation. Raising benefits in line with the expected inflation rate would protect the most vulnerable and boost the economy. It would be costly but not as costly as doing nothing.",News/Business,This is Rishi Sunak’s chance to stop a recession; any delay and it will be too late | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/20/this-is-rishi-sunak-chance-to-stop-a-recession-any-delay-and-it-will-be-too-late
3/20/2022,"The year is 1979 and a foxy gang of actors from Houston, Texas, are pounding down the highway in a truck plastered with the name “Plowing Service”. The latest film from horror director Ti West (The House of the Devil), about a porn movie shoot gone wrong, is ripe with playful winks and nudges. Producer Wayne (Martin Henderson) casts his younger girlfriend, the coke-snorting Maxine (Mia Goth), in “The Farmer’s Daughter” alongside Bobby-Lynne (a witty Brittany Snow) and former marine Jackson (Scott Mescudi, AKA Kid Cudi). Director RJ (Owen Campbell) aspires to make “a good dirty movie”, but to his sound recordist girlfriend, Lorraine (Jenna Ortega), “it’s smut”. Their activities titillate the older couple next door. West has great fun teasing the audience ahead of the gory climax. Even more provocative is the real “money shot”, which sees the elderly lovers getting their kicks.
