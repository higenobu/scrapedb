3/22/2022,"The number of people in the UK using drugs to combat anxiety is soaring, driven by major increases among women and young adults, new research shows. Women are more than twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with anxiety and prescribed medication including antidepressants to relieve its symptoms, the study found. “It may be that women are more likely to seek help for anxiety, or are more willing to take medication for their mental health, and are therefore more likely to be prescribed anxiolytics [anti-anxiety drugs]”, said Dr Charlotte Archer, the study’s lead authory. The finding that more women are diagnosed with and treated for anxiety mirrors the case with depression, added Archer, an academic at the University of Bristol’s medical school. Her NHS-funded findings were published in the British Journal of General Practice on Tuesday. They are based on analysis by Archer and her colleagues of the care given to almost 2.6 million adults registered with 176 GP practices across the UK from 2003 to 2018, including 546,154 prescriptions for anxiolytics. For every man using antidepressants, there are 2.26 women on them, 2.22 for Valium-like drugs called benzodiazepines, 2.33 for beta blockers and 2.19 for anticonvulsants. “Even those drugs less frequently prescribed for more severe anxiety, like the antipsychotics, are more likely to be prescribed for women,” said Archer. Use of anti-anxiety medication was steady between 2003 and 2008 but then began rising – possibly because of hardship due to the financial crash that year, she said. The number of new prescriptions issued for anxiety rose from 25 or 26 per 1,000 person years at risk – a measure of the prevalence of anxiety – during that period to 43.6 in 2018. The study found that the biggest rises in prescription of anti-anxiety drugs after that were in 25- to 34-year-olds, closely followed by under-25s and those aged 35 to 44. That could reflect better detection of anxiety, the increasing severity of symptoms or the growing acceptability of using medication to treat the condition, she said. However, the “substantial” rise in new diagnoses of anxiety among 18- to 35-year-olds is likely to be the result of individuals having been refused case from NHS child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) when they were under 18, Archer suggested. “For example, in 2018-19 over a quarter of referrals to Camhs were rejected, potentially leading to an increase in prescribing amongst the youngest age group [studied].” Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the proven effectiveness of antidepressants meant the rise in their use “should not be a cause for alarm”. He added: “Indeed, it is most likely to suggest that more people are seeking medical help for anxiety for anxiety-related conditions, as well as improvement in the identification and diagnosis of them.” A key reason more women are prescribed drugs for anxiety than men is that “women are more comfortable seeking help for mental health conditions”. Men are less likely to request treatment for the condition than women “because of the stigma associated with poor mental health”, he added. Archer warned that some people with anxiety are likely to be suffering “unintended harm” as a result of being prescribed drugs for which there is scant evidence that they work, such as beta blockers, or which contradict clinical guidelines, such as antipsychotics, or which may not be effective if taken long-term, such as antidepressants. The new research does not capture the impact of the Covid pandemic, which has led to a growing number of people presenting at their GP surgery with mental health problems, Marshall added. He called for NHS mental health care to be improved so that more people can access therapy rather than taking drugs.",News/Society,Women and young adults propel huge rise in use of anti-anxiety drugs ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/22/women-and-young-adults-propel-huge-rise-in-use-of-anti-anxiety-drugs
3/22/2022,"Hundreds of thousands of people of colour may be paying an “ethnicity penalty” of at least £280 a year each in higher car insurance costs, an investigation by Citizens Advice has claimed. The national charity said its year-long investigation had uncovered a “shocking trend” of people of colour paying a lot more for motor cover than white people, and that the penalty was up to £950 in some locations. However, the main insurance industry trade body disputed the report’s conclusions, saying insurers “never” used ethnicity as a factor when setting prices. Working with the research agency Europe Economics, Citizens Advice carried out 649 mystery shops for car insurance quotes using six different customer names across eight postcodes in England. The aim was to compare areas with a high white population with those where there was a high proportion of people of colour. The charity estimated that 754,000 people of colour held car insurance policies and lived in areas affected by the alleged ethnicity penalty. Citizens Advice said it found that in some areas “the difference in price was more than 100%,” and that common risk factors such as crime rates and deprivation levels could not account for this. “We’re concerned this suggests that areas with large communities of colour may be identified as more risky, even when objective risk factors are controlled,” it said. It found that quotes in areas with large proportions of black or south Asian people came in at least £280 higher than quotes in largely white postcodes, but that the ethnicity penalty was “up to £950 in some places”. In Bristol – the location of two of the postcodes – an area with a population that comprised 41% black people and 18% south Asian people produced an average quote for a Vauxhall Corsa that was £283 – or 51% – higher than that for a neighbourhood less than two miles away with an 87% white population. “This is despite the white area having a higher relative crime rate,” said the report. For the “customers” the researchers picked names often associated with certain ethnic groups, though Citizens Advice said these ended up not having much impact on the prices being quoted. “This suggests this penalty is paid by everyone who lives in an area, regardless of their ethnicity. However, people of colour are [statistically] far more likely to pay it,” it added. Separately, the charity analysed 18,000 car insurance costs reported by people who came to it for help with debt in 2021. It said it found that on average, people of colour paid £250 a year more than white people. Possible links between insurance and ethnicity have been highlighted before: in 2016, a report co-written by the former equality commissioner Trevor Phillips claimed millions of people living in areas with a high density of minority-ethnic households were paying an “ethnic minority penalty” of up to £450 a year in higher motor premiums. Responding to the latest findings, James Dalton, the director of general insurance policy at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers never use ethnicity as a factor when setting prices, and our members comply with the Equality Act. All other rating factors being the same, two people of different ethnicities who live in the same postcode will pay the same premium for their car insurance.” He added: “Insurance is priced on individual risk levels, and there are many different risk-related factors that are used to calculate the price … but ethnicity is not one of them.”",Lifestyle/Money,People of colour may face ‘ethnicity penalty’ on car insurance in England,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/22/people-of-colour-may-face-ethnicity-penalty-on-car-insurance-in-england
3/22/2022,"British parents are finding themselves locked out of work and struggling to make ends meet as rising childcare fees add to the cost of living crisis, according to a survey. Childcare costs have gone up by 3.5% for three to four-year-olds over the last year, while parents are paying 2.5% more for under twos, the survey found. Meanwhile, childcare availability has declined, as the sector grapples with the continuing impact of the pandemic. Less than 60% of councils say they have enough childcare places for children under two, down from 72% in 2021, while only 59% report having enough childcare available for parents working full-time, down from 68% last year, which is “limiting many parents’ ability to work”, the survey says. The findings are detailed in the Coram Family and Childcare’s 21st annual childcare survey, based on information provided by local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales and published on Tuesday, the day before the chancellor is due to deliver his spring statement, which is expected to address the cost of living crisis. The report also found the numbers accessing early years free childcare entitlements has dropped significantly, with 38% of local authorities reporting a decline in numbers accessing free hours for two-year-olds and 40% seeing a decrease in the uptake among three to four-year-olds. The survey also highlights stark regional disparities in cost and childcare availability. Just 30% of councils in the east of England say they have enough childcare for under twos, compared with 100% for the north-east. Meanwhile, the cost of 25 hours of nursery childcare for under twos is 50% higher in inner London (£183.56) than in Yorkshire and Humberside (£122.17). Only one in five (21%) local authorities reported they had enough childcare available for children with special educational needs and disabilities, a decrease from 25% in 2021. Ellen Broomé, managing director of Coram Family and Childcare, said: “Many parents, up and down the country, will be locked out of work or struggle to make ends meet as childcare prices continue to go up and the availability of places goes down. And the more vulnerable children will miss out the most on this boost to their development and outcomes. “High quality childcare is key social infrastructure, it helps parents work and narrows the gap between poorer children and their more affluent peers. With families’ bills skyrocketing, as the chancellor stands up to present his budget, we urge him to make sure that childcare and children’s life chances are at the very heart of his announcements.” Bridget Phillipson, shadow education secretary, said: “It’s extraordinary that at a time when prices are spiralling, the average family is still spending far more on childcare than on their weekly food shop. “High quality childcare in the early years and around school boosts children’s life chances, but this worrying decline in available childcare risks limiting parents’ ability to work, putting further pressure on household finances.” The government said the number of childcare places offered by providers remained stable. “The early years of a child’s life are the most crucial, which is why we have invested more than £3.5bn in each of the last three years to deliver the free childcare offers, including the 30 hours a week for working parents. We are also investing millions in family hubs, where families can access important support services,” a government spokesperson said.",News/Business,UK parents locked out of work due to rising childcare fees – survey,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/22/uk-parents-locked-out-of-work-due-to-rising-childcare-fees-survey
3/22/2022,"Rich countries must end all oil and gas production in the next 12 years, while the poorest nations should be given 28 years, to provide a fair transition away from fossil fuels, according to a study. The report, led by Prof Kevin Anderson from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at Manchester University, found that wealthy countries such as the UK, US and Australia had until 2034 to stop all oil and gas production to give the world a 50% chance of preventing devastating climate breakdown, while the poorest nations that are also heavily reliant on fossil fuels should be given until 2050. Anderson said that while it was now clear there had to be a rapid shift away from “a fossil fuel economy”, it was essential this was done in a fair and equitable way. “There are huge differences in the ability of countries to end oil and gas production, while maintaining vibrant economies and delivering a just transition for their citizens,” he said. The report examines each country’s wealth and how dependent its economy is on fossil fuel production. It found that many poorer countries would be crippled economically and politically by a rapid move away from oil and gas, while wealthier nations could afford to end fossil fuel production while remaining relatively prosperous. For example, it found that oil and gas revenue contributed 8% to US GDP but without it the country’s GDP per head would still be around $60,000 (£46,000) – the second highest globally. Meanwhile, countries such as South Sudan, the Republic of the Congo and Gabon, despite being small producers of oil and gas, have little other economic revenue and would be devastated by a rapid transformation. Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who oversaw the 2015 Paris summit, welcomed the findings. “This new study is a timely reminder that all countries must phase out oil and gas production rapidly, with wealthy countries going fastest, while also ensuring a just transition for workers and communities that rely on it.” The report’s findings come amid a renewed focus on climate justice among civil society groups and countries in the global south – particularly at last year’s Cop26 conference in Glasgow. But Anderson warned many wealthier nations still only paid “lip service” to the idea. “I don’t see any sense of equity being taken seriously by the policymakers in the wealthy parts of the world,” he said. The study, commissioned by the International Institute for Sustainable Development, quantifies how much future oil and gas production is consistent with the Paris climate target of 1.5C of heating – and what this means for the 88 countries responsible for 99.97% of global oil and gas supply. It found that for a 50% chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C: The 19 “highest-capacity” countries, with average non-oil GDP per capita of more than $50,000, must end production by 2034, with a 74% cut by 2030. This group produces 35% of global oil and gas and includes the US, UK, Norway, Canada, Australia and the United Arab Emirates. The 14 “high-capacity” countries, with average non-oil GDP per capita of nearly $28,000, must end production by 2039, with a 43% cut by 2030. They produce 30% of global oil and gas and include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Kazakhstan. Eleven “medium-capacity” countries, with average non-oil GDP per capita of $17,000, must end production by 2043, with a 28% cut by 2030. They produce 11% of global oil and gas and include China, Brazil and Mexico. Nineteen “low-capacity” countries with average non-oil GDP per capita of $10,000, must end production by 2045, with an 18% cut by 2030. They produce 13% of global oil and gas and include Indonesia, Iran and Egypt. Twenty-five “lowest-capacity” countries, with average non-oil GDP per capita of $3,600, must end production by 2050 with a 14% cut by 2030. They produce 11% of global oil and gas and include Iraq, Libya, Angola and South Sudan. The study found that even with this timescale poorer countries would need financial support to make the transition if they were to avoid massive economic and political upheaval. Lidy Nacpil, a climate justice campaigner and coordinator of the Asian Peoples’ Movement on Debt and Development, said: “A rapid, just and equitable phase-out of oil and gas is still possible, with the timeframes suggested in this report, as long as rich countries provide substantial financial, technical and political support, and cancel the debt.”",News/Environment,"Rich countries must stop producing oil and gas by 2034, says study",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/22/rich-countries-must-stop-producing-oil-and-gas-by-2034-says-study
3/22/2022,"Hugh Grant has dismissed reports that he will be the next actor to play the Doctor, TV’s most famous time traveller, in the BBC’s Doctor Who. The 61-year-old actor, best-known for starring in British romcom films such as Notting Hill, Love Actually and Four Weddings and a Funeral, responded to speculation, first reported by the Daily Mirror, that he was in the running to replace Jodie Whittaker. Grant had played the Doctor in a Comic Relief special in 1999. He was offered the role in 2004, but turned it down. Whittaker announced in 2021 that she would not play the Doctor again after three special episodes due to air later this year, meaning a vacancy has arisen. However, in response to a Guardian article about his potential new role, Grant tweeted: “Nothing against Dr W but I’m not. No idea where the story came from.” The Daily Mirror had said “conversations [were] in progress” according to a TV insider, after Russell T Davies, who has previously been head writer on the BBC TV series, signed on to return as showrunner for its 60th anniversary. It has been reported that Davies could turn the series into a “Marvel-like” product, in a reference to the franchise responsible for comic-book inspired films such as Iron Man and The Avengers.",Arts/Film,Hugh Who?

3/22/2022,"A 17-month-old baby has been killed after being attacked by a dog at her home in St Helens. Merseyside police were called to the address on Bidston Avenue in Blackbrook after reports the girl had been attacked. Emergency services attended and took her to hospital but she died as a result of her injuries. The dog was put down by police, who said it will now be subjected to further forensic examination to determine its breed and legality. DI Lisa Milligan said the dog had only been bought by the family a week before, and detectives were looking to find its previous owner. She said: “This is a tragic incident and our thoughts are with the child’s family at this devastating time. The little girl’s parents and wider family are absolutely devastated and our specialist Family liaison officers are providing them with support at this horrendous time. “Our officers will remain on Bidston Avenue this evening and in the coming days to provide reassurance to the local community and we will work tirelessly to establish the full circumstances.” Milligan urged witnesses or anybody who had any information on the dog to contact police. She added: “Our officers take the issue of dangerous dogs very seriously. Over the past years we have worked proactively with the five local authorities in Merseyside to ensure prohibited dogs are taken off the streets.” Anyone with any information should contact @MerPolCC or Merseyside police Contact Centre on Facebook, with reference 22000196837.

3/22/2022,"The flooding that has ravaged south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales over the past month represents a perfect political storm for a prime minister about to face the people he purports to lead. While the levies have breached in one tributary of Liberal National party heartland, the implications will be more broadly felt, with hapless, homeless victims serving as living testament to Scott Morrison’s limitations all the way to voting day. The PM is the consummate marketer whose commitment to his craft is such that even his failures are packaged into simple, reusable soundbites: “This is coal, don’t be scared”, “I don’t hold a hose, mate” and “It’s not a race.” Climate denial, abrogation of responsibility and incompetent delivery of services: the floods have tied these memes seamlessly into a single environmental-economic-social catastrophe. Let’s break it down. First the lump of coal. As treasurer, Morrison infamously fondled a lump of coal in parliament to ridicule Labor’s call for energy transition. He amped up the same shtick to fuel his 2019 victory, reassuring rural voters there would be no climate action on his watch. But after a term bookended by catastrophic bushfires and floods, the prime minister now finds himself wedged between those who believed his promise to hold back history and an urban insurgency demanding he do better. The pressure from the business community and the teal independents has driven a change in the rhetoric since Glasgow, with the government now holding a modest 2050 target (albeit insufficient) in the hope he could pacify his own base. But as this week’s Essential Report shows, these floods serve as a reminder that the Coalition government’s ambitions over the past three terms have been too limited and we are now all paying the price for that neglect. We see strong support for statements framing floods around the need for action on climate change and renewable energy, as well as a significant endorsement of the proposition that the government had contributed to the floods through its lack of action. Pointedly this final figure includes one-third of Coalition voters. Second: “I don’t hold a hose” has become synonymous with the PM’s tendency to duck responsibility when he is called to account. While the Hawaiian sojourn was unforgettable, we can’t really blame the prime minister for being slow on the ground this time given he had a bout of Covid. But what is being brutally exposed is the lack of any preparation for what, in his own words, has become Australia’s new reality. The original “hose” statement was an attempt to explain the chain of command in national disasters; but in the floods the problem that has been exposed is there is no chain, just slashing and slushing. Since coming to power in 2013 the Coalition has defunded the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility and the independent Climate Commission, and streamlined the CSIRO’s Climate Adaptation Flagship. Closer to the flood epicentre, the National Centre for Flood Research at Southern Cross University in Lismore has been sequestered, while the National Resilience and Recovery Agency chose not to direct government funds to Lismore. Finally, to the sense of urgency that leadership in a crisis demands. Even when Morrison did turn up, there was a slow-walk into deploying emergency support, including getting into a semantic debate over who had to seek help and when, rather than recognising the impending crisis and getting ahead of it. At a time when the government is trying to stabilise, a separate question in this week’s report shows a further erosion of regard for the government in the management of the floods. This poor performance has a spillover effect. Amid the global pandemic and the looming threat of nuclear war, an incumbent has the natural advantage in being in the leader’s chair when people really need them. But if that leader repeatedly shows they can’t deliver, that natural advantage becomes a liability, a constant reminder of past failure. Despite such virulent shortcomings we should remain cautious about concluding that the PM is sunk. The “ScoMo” brand that he lovingly created before the 2019 election still delivers among those sections of the electorate who view politics from the corner of their eye. A real tell in focus groups that I have observed is whether the participant refers to Morrison as ScoMo. Where they do the brand provides a protective shield around him; while they recognise his missteps, they are far more prepared to forgive him. After all, “you can’t blame ScoMo for the pandemic”. Elections are not a contest of ideas. They are contests of competing realities, each side stubbornly clinging to their “facts”. And, as a final question in this week’s report shows, people don’t really believe anything they hear from politicians any more. You can read these numbers with despair (how can we ever agree if we don’t have a common starring point?) or as the healthy scepticism of the majority of voters who will not simply accept what they scroll or hear. While regard for traditional media is marginally higher, it’s still less than a majority who say what they read is more truth than lies. All we are left with are the views of friends and family, who are themselves as lacking in trust in everyone else as we are. In this context, the perfect storm plays a seminal role. It challenges ScoMo’s version of an upbeat reality where we are in safe hands by providing a series of irrefutable, inconvenient truths. Like: governments that hold back energy transition should be culpable for their inaction. Like: climate change is already happening and remediation needs to be turbo-charged. And like: you have to believe in the idea of government if you are to have any hope of governing.
